The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from  the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserv e System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensiv e digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a re daction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redact ed passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    
 
                                                
 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and we re not checked or corrected by staff. 
  1.  Federal funds  traded at r ates near t he FOMC’s targets over  the inter meeting peri od,
except on t he last  busines s day of t he year.   On that day , the Des k’s gene rous res erve
provision pushe d the effect ive rate down to 5. 41 percent, a f airly t ypical devia tion from
target f or a year-end.   Since the la st FOMC meeting, the Desk has  redeemed $1.8 bil lion of
Treasury securities , mostly Treasury coupon issues, t o continue bringing SOMA holdings
into conformance wit h the per-is sue limits .  In part t o offset t he result ing reser ve drain, t he
Desk purchased $3.5 bi llion of Tre asury coupon secur ities i n the market and $670 mil lion of

wording o f the Com mittee’s annou ncement an d weaker eco nomic da ta apparently
fostered a  sense that  an easing of  monetary polic y was imminent.  Even  so, the t iming
and size of the FOM C’s 50 basis point cut in the target federal funds rate on January 3
surprised mark et partic ipants,  and many inferre d that additi onal monetary ea sings
would occur sooner t han they had expe cted.  Over the  entire int ermeeting per iod,
interest rates on sh ort-term Tre asury securities an d the highest-g rade private de bt fell

the decline s on private  debt refl ecting an unwindi ng of year-e nd premiums.  Current

of future easings apparently contributed to a sense that the odd s of a prolonged
period of economic w eakness had diminished.  This revision to sentim ent bolstered
equity market s, with broa d equity pric e indexes i ncreasing,  on balance,  over the
intermeeting period despite further substantial dow nward revisions to analysts’ near-
term earnings  expectati ons.  Moreover,  yields on l ower-tier  investment- grade bonds
and junk b onds fell 35 and  116 basis poin ts, respectively.  The ab atement of safe
have n dema nds, along wi th he ightened  pros pects for a large tax cut and p erhaps some
increase in inflation compensation, contributed to a sm all rise in longer-term Treasury
yields.  In some segments of financial markets, however, concern s about risk appeared
to escalate.  Results fro m the Janu ary Senior L oan Officer O pinion Su rvey indicate
that a majority of banks have further tightened their standard s and terms on business
loans.  Moreover, risk spreads on lower-rated com mercial paper have widened
signifi cantly si nce early J anuary, as  the default s of Califor nia utili ties, along with the
earlier downgrades of other prominent commercial paper is suers, seem to have
increased investo r wariness.  To d ate, fallout from th e difficulties of the C alifornia
utiliti es has been l imited, al though rating a gencies have  announced that t he debts of
some corporati ons and municipali ties af fected by t he West Coast elec tricit y situati on
have been downg raded or are being mon itored for possible downgrade.
(3) In December, over all busine ss debt grew at  a moderate pace,  but the
patterns of financing continued to reflect heightened investor concern s about risk
(chart 2).   Although issuanc e of invest ment-grade bonds was  brisk, vi rtually no
equities or junk bonds were bro ught to market.  Bank bu siness loans grew rapidly,
with the adv ance owing  partly to lower -rated comm ercial paper issuers  temporarily
drawing down lines  of credit  at banks to av oid paying high y ear-end premiums,  and
comm ercial paper ou tstanding declin ed.  Since the inter meeting po licy move in ea rly

have continued t o advance bris kly in Januar y, like ly boosted by f urther subst itution
out of the commerci al paper market .  With lower-r ated borrowers  dissuaded by
elevated i nterest r ates and unabl e to issue a t maturitie s beyond a few day s, the
outstanding a mount of commercial pape r has continue d to run off in  January.  I n the
household  sector, consum er credit is estimated  to have decelera ted sharply in
Dece mber , and b ank lo an dat a sugg est con tinued  mod eratio n early  this yea r. 
Mortgage grow th is estimated to have remained relatively strong, however, supp orted
by declines in m ortgage rates.  Fed eral debt contin ued to contr act late last year and in
January.  Data  for debt growth i n recent months ar e partial  and preliminar y, but on
balance it appears that nonf ederal and total debt expanded at a moderate pace,  similar
to that recorded in the third quarter of last year.
(4) M2 growth p icked up sharply in Decem ber and appears to have risen
further in January.2  The strength l ikely ref lects i n part inves tors’ dec isions to s eek the
safety and liquid ity of M2 assets, suc h as retail mon ey funds and  liquid depo sits, in
response to t he rise in e quity market vol atility in November and December.   Also, the
recent declines in s hort- and inter mediate-term  rates have narro wed the op portunity
cost of holdi ng M2.  M3 has grown even more rapi dly than M2, boost ed in part by
faster issuance of large time deposits to fund a pickup in bank  credit, which
accelera ted to an 11 per cent annual gr owth rate in Dece mber.  In addit ion,
institutional m oney funds h ave ballooned  as their yields, which  adjust to chan ges in
market rates with a lag, have become m ore attractive with the fall in short-term
market interest rates.
(5) While the w eaker econom ic outlook in th e United Sta tes, along with
4
lower int erest  rates , tende d to put downwar d pressu re on the  foreig n exchange  value
of the dollar, economic stagnation in Japan exerted  a countervailing influence.  Since
the December FOMC meeting, the dol lar was about unc hanged, on net,  against t he
currenc ies of  the major  industr ialized countr ies.  The dolla r lost  3 percen t of it s value
relative to the euro , on net, as econom ic growth in E urope cam e to be seen as likely to
outpace that in the United States.   The dollar also depreciated vi s-à-vis the Canadian
dollar as the momentum in domestic spending and the prospect of considerabl e fiscal
stimulus in Canada  were thought li kely to cus hion the impact on Cana dian exports  of
softening U.S. aggregate  demand.  By contrast, incoming economic data for Japan
proved disappoi nting to hopes t hat economic rec overy had gaine d a foothold,  and the
dollar appreciated 4½ percent agains t the yen over the intermeeti ng period.  The bleak
Japanese economic picture revived t alk that the Bank of Japan may return its  official
interest rate,  now at ¼ percent, to zero, and money market futures rates , as well as
longer- term yie lds, s hifte d down a touch.   The exchan ge value  of the dol lar ros e about

(6) This section co nsiders longer -term strategies for m onetary policy a s well
as the poli cy implicat ions of sev eral of the  alternat ive scenar ios present ed in the
Greenbook.3  All of the char ts include  a baseline  scenario i n which the Greenbook
forecast  is extende d through 2005 usi ng the FRB/US model, adjust ed to preser ve the
key characteristics of th e econom y embod ied in the judg mental foreca st.  In this
extension, poten tial supply is assum ed to expand  at the same rate  as in 2002, with
structural labor productivity growth continu ing at 3 percent per year.  The earlier
acceleration of structural productivity had helped to hold d own price increases
because eff iciency ga ins outpaced t he lagging pi ckup in real wag es.  But with  the
leveling  out of struc tural product ivity growt h, this di sinflat ionary eff ect wanes,  and the
degree of  labo r mark et slack cons istent wi th steady inflation (t he ef fective NAIRU)
edges up from about 4¾ percent currently to about 5¼ percent by 2005.4  Also after
2002, t he feder al surpl us on a NIPA basi s remains  roughly s table a t its c urrent v alue
of about 2 p ercent of GD P.  The dollar is p redicted to dep reciate at a 5 percen t rate
per year in real terms, and foreign econom ic growth picks up som ewhat.  Together,
these l ast two f actors  roughly s tabilize the  ratio o f the cu rrent a ccount de ficit to GDP.
(7) In the alternative strategies f or monetary policy  shown in chart 3,  the
baseline  policy keeps the federal funds rate unchanged at 5¾  percent beyond 2002.  In
contrast t o the conditi ons underlying  the long-run s cenario se ction of a number of
bluebook s in recent years, pote ntial supply an d aggregate d emand ar e approxim ately
in balance at  the end of the  Greenbook foreca st in 2002,  and littl e impetus to ra ise or
lower inflation rates  is in the pipeline.   Moreover, the real federal f unds rate at that

Taylor Rule
Price Stability
1.  The real federal funds rate is calculated as the quarterly nominal funds rate minus
the four-quarter percent change in the PCE chain-weight price index excluding food and energy.
2.  The Taylor rule uses a concept of potential output corresponding to the effective NAIRU, rather than corresponding to
the long-run NAIRU as in the original specification of the Taylor rule.
7
  5.   In the policy rule, coefficients on the contemporan eous output and inflation gaps are
equal to ½ .
  6.   In 2005, the Taylor rule has not yet s tabilized the economy at targe ted inflation and an
output gap of ze ro, but would do so i n the longer r un.time is close to its eq uilibrium lev el (recognizing , of course, the cons iderable
uncer tainty t hat su rroun ds this  and al l other  aspect s of ou r proj ection s).  
Consequently,  under this pol icy, the  unemployment rate r emains in the v icinity  of the
effect ive NAIRU from 2002 to 2005,  and core PCE inflat ion is li ttle change d.  The
Taylor rule  policy set s the feder al funds rat e in response  to core PCE infla tion and the
gap between actual output and the level of  output consistent with the ef fective
NAIRU.5  The equilibri um real inter est rate  used in the rul e is that i mplicit in t he
extended Greenboo k baseline (slightly above 4 percent), while targeted inflation is set
at 1½ perce nt.  As show n by the dot-d ash lines, the path fo r the federal fund s rate
given by the Tay lor rule f ollows the bas eline ass umption reasonabl y closely , although
the nomin al and real federa l funds rates are a b it lower in the n ear term and  a bit
higher later.6  With the  price stability  policy, the Co mmittee p laces inflation on a  path
to virtual price stability–as measured by core PCE  inflation at a 1 percent rate.  In
orde r to accompli sh this obje ctive, policy ha s to be tighter than t he ba seline at some
point.  In t he alternat ive shown, th e funds rate  is kept at  its curre nt 6 percent l evel for
a time so  that th e requir ed tight ness occ urs ear ly in t he simula tion per iod, an d thus
inflation is on a perce ptible downward track beginning in 2002.
(8)  Chart 4 presents alternativ e supply-side sc enarios .  The 4 percent
NAIRU  scenario has be en designed to  explain the go od perform ance of inflation in
recent yea rs in terms of  a permanently l ower long-run NAIRU, rather  than on the
basis of transitory effects o f accelerating pro ductivity.  Again , monetary po licy is
assumed to  follow a Taylo r rule, but one th at incorporate s a lower inflation  target

  7.  The rule al so incorporat es a slig htly lower equi librium real  interes t rate t hat arise s on
account of an inc rease in pot ential out put that i s not accompanied by a c orresponding
incre ase in gover nment s pendin g or fo reign GDP.(1 percent) than was used in the baseline’s Taylor rule, as the Com mittee takes
advantage of the “opportun ity” of emerging slack to make further pro gress toward
price stability.7  As shown by the d ot-dash line, the federal funds rate is eased
aggressiv ely over the  next two years  to limit the  rise in t he unemployment rate , but the
lower NAIRU means that a decli ne in infl ation to 1 per cent sti ll can be ac hieved.  The
product ivity slowd own scenario r etains the  staff vi ew of the NAIRU and the role of
changes in st ructural pro ductivity  growth in the i nflation pr ocess, but  assumes that  the
rate of st ructural pro ductivity  growth going forwar d falls pe rmanently to 1½ perc ent
(its 197 3-94 av erage)  rather  than c ontin uing t o run  at 3 pe rcent a s in the  baselin e. 
Slower trend growth  raises the effective NAIRU sharply, which  puts upward pressure
on inflation, but it  also weakens demand; on balance, demand is restr ained more than
potential supply relative to the baseline, lowering the equilibrium real interest rate.  If
policy follows th e Taylor rule, as assu med in this sce nario, the federal fu nds rate drifts
down, but by less than the decline in the equ ilibrium real funds rate in order to check
the rise i n inflati on.
(9) Chart 5 con siders the imp lications of alternat ive demand-si de
scenarios  presented in the Greenboo k, but under the assumption th at monetary
policy follows the Taylor rule.  In the recessi on scenario (dot-d ash lines), weakne ss in
aggregate de mand is more pronounced tha n in the basel ine by enough to pus h the
econom y into an outr ight recession.  Th e downw ard impetu s to deman d reverses fully
during 2002.  As show n, the unemploymen t rate rises to 6 percent in 2002 even
thou gh the  federa l fund s rate is  reduc ed to a bout  4½ p ercent  by the  end o f 2001.

increases  slightl y in 2002 as l ower interes t rates i nduce a steepe r drop in the ex change
value of the dollar than in the baseline, raising import prices.  In the growth pause
scenario, the near-term weakness in aggregate dem and stems solely from excess
busin ess inv entor ies and  not als o from  a slow ing in  final d eman d, as in t he bas eline. 
After excess inventorie s are worked off, the great er underlying strength in f inal
demand shows through to agg regate output  growth.  As shown by the  dotted line , the
Committee l owers the  federa l funds r ate to 5 ¾ percent i n the curr ent quart er but
promptly rever ses this  action.  With f inal demand persi stently  stronger tha n in the
baseline scenario, after 2001 both nominal and real interest rates need to rise further.

(11) Even though veloci ty and opportunit y cost have moved t ogether on
average over recent years, significant divergences also are apparent that may be related
in part to the unusual behavior of the eq uity market.  Beginning in 1996, investors
apparently be gan to view e quity returns a s quite attractive, and  flows into equ ity
mutual funds surged at the exp ense of M2, with the result that velocity trended higher
through mid-1997.  H owever, velocity subsequently moved  back down as the further
runup of equity prices boosted stock m arket wealth appreciably relative to income,

  8.  The rate of g rowth of M 2 at price stability is deriv ed under th e assumptio n of stable
velocity by  summing the staf f’s est imate of potent ial real  GDP for the next two years  (about
4 perce nt) and th e residua l bias in the  GDP  deflator (½  percen t).and household s seemed to tak e steps to rebalan ce portfolios by r eallocating fund s to
assets i n M2.  M2 velocity has  been flat ov er the past  two years.   In 2000, the  damping
effect  on money demand of the ris e in opportunit y cost appear ed to be offs et by the
response of ho useholds to e quity market vol atility and to a fla t, and at t imes invert ed,
yield curve , which gave i nvestors l ittle i ncentive t o shift f unds out of M2 asset s and
into lo nger-m aturit y capit al mar ket ins trum ents. 
(12) M2 growth is expect ed to moderate somewhat  in 2001 as the  expansion
of nominal income s lows.  The downshif t in M2 growth is te mpered, however,  by the
reduction in s hort-term int erest rat es stemming from the  assumed 75 basis  points of
policy easing in the first quarter and by the anticipated flatness of the yield curve.  In
addition,  lower mortgage ra tes in the  forecast  spur a wave of mortga ge refinanc ing
activity  that pushes up M2 g rowth as mortgage servicing agen ts temporarily place  the
prepayments in t ransacti on accounts bef ore remitti ng them to holders  of mortgage-
backed securi ties.  Moreover, househol ds are expect ed to favor M2 ass ets in vie w of
the disappoin ting returns in th e equity mar ket anticipated in  the staff forecast.  W ith
M2 grow th slowing co nsiderably less tha n nomin al income, M 2 velocity is projected  to
fall nota bly this y ear.  In 200 2, the st aff assumes  that short- term rates hol d steady and
that saver s will have l argely comple ted their a djustments t o the flat  yield curve  and
lower expected  returns on h olding equ ities.  In this environm ent, M2 gro wth is
expected to level out, running at about the sam e pace as nominal incom e.  Even
though infla tion persi sts over t he next two year s in the st aff fore cast, M2 growth on
average in 2001 and 2002 is only modestly a bove the 4½ percent average pace that
would be associated with price sta bility because of s hortfalls in the growth of r eal
output relative to  that of potential.8

Short-run policy alternatives 
(13) The staff ha s again revi sed down its outl ook for economic gr owth in the
near term, reflecting weaker expansion in aggregate dem and than previously projected
and m ore ag gressiv e prod uction  cutba cks to a lign in vento ries be tter wi th sale s. 
However, final  demands over the f orecast hori zon are supporte d by the eff ects on
consumption and inve stment of cont inuing elev ated struc tural product ivity gai ns and
are augmented by the substantial decl ines in most interest r ates over recent months as
well as by proj ected decre ases in ene rgy prices  and the forei gn exchange val ue of the
dollar.  As a  result,  the inventor y correcti on is completed f airly promptl y, and
projected econ omic grow th resumes in  the spring and  picks up therea fter.  Despite
the economic rebound, the sizable shortf all from potential output growth in the next
few quarters quickly pushes up the u nemployment rate to aro und 5¼ percent b y year-
end.  By then, though, aggregate  demand is expanding at a pace just short of pote ntial
and the unemploym ent rate edges only a bit higher over the remaind er of the forecast
period.  With st ructural pro ductivity  growth level ing out, the  rise in t he
unemployment rate is seen as necessar y to keep core consumer inflation rat es near
current levels.  A gainst this backd rop, the staff forecast assu mes only a sm all
addit ional c ut in th e feder al fund s rate in  the ne ar term . 
(14) If the Com mittee found  the staff assessment o f the outlook to  be both
reasonable and acceptable, it might opt for alternative A , which would lower  the
federal funds rate 25 basis points to 5¾ percent.  In the context of this forecast, such
an easi ng leans  against  softne ss in ag gregate  demand while  resis ting an e ventual  pickup
of inflat ion in circ umstances of c ontinued press ures on labor r esources.   In light of
the considerable uncertainty about the prosp ects for spending, such a measured step
could be seen  as striking a balan ce between tw o possible scena rios for aggrega te
demand discussed earlier–a reces sion and a growth pause.  To be sure, the market has
13
a more substanti al easing a t this meeti ng built int o interest  rates,  but this expe ctation
was shaped  in part by the C ommittee ’s unexpectedly a ggressive action e arlier this
month.  Over a som ewhat longer horizon, the structure of interest rates incorporates
a drop in the funds rate to 4¾  percent by year-end–more than  the Comm ittee may see
as likel y to be neces sary to res tore accept able growth.   If so, i t may view disappo inting
markets a little a s possibly foster ing more sustainable and stabili zing financial
conditions.   Indeed, the  Committee may be concerne d that another  50 basis poi nt
action hard on the heels of the January 3 m ove risks leading investors to expect even
more ease at f uture meetings  than currentl y.  Such a reac tion would height en the
possibility that  the stimulus emanating from financial market s would give additional
impetus to a rebound in  spending that might soon  be underway in any event.  G iven
the lags i n the effe cts of monetar y policy,  any result ing price pre ssures coul d be
difficult to contain even with a relatively quick turnaround in po licy.
(15) If the Com mittee were to  choose this altern ative, it might wa nt to retain
the current statem ent that the risks are  weighted to ward econ omic wea kness, unless it
were c onfid ent tha t the ec onom y had s tabiliz ed and  mod erate g rowth  was in  prosp ect. 
With on ly a 25 basis poin t easing, market in terest rates probab ly would b ack up, credit
spreads wo uld widen  some, and sto ck prices wou ld decline as the p olicy move fell
short of mar ket expectations a nd concern s about a pro longed perio d of econom ic
weak ness re -inten sified. 
(16) If the Committee t hought the economy might  well be weaker  than in the
staff f orecast,  it may wish to t ake another s ubstantial  easing act ion by cutti ng the
federal f unds rate 50 bas is points a t this meeti ng, as in alternative A N.  As the
recession simulation illustrated, a substantial shortfall in demand would req uire
prompt and forceful policy action.  Even  if the Committee thoug ht the staff forecast
was the mo st reasonable po int estimate, it mig ht still favor a 50 basis p oint easing if it
14
perceived that the probabilities around that outcom e were skewed toward
considerabl y softer de mand than in that f orecast.   With inflati on and inflat ion
expectati ons likel y to remain quies cent for a whi le, a subs tantial e asing to cus hion
downside risks to econom ic activity is unlikely to boost materially the risk of greater
inflation pressure s.  Indeed, a substan tial easing migh t also be viewed  as appropria te if
the Comm ittee did not see outsized downside risks to dem and but thought price
pressures were unlikely t o intensify at an unemployment rate near i ts current level,  as
in the 4 percent NAIR U simulation earlier in this bluebook.  Financial m arket
participa nts current ly have buil t in high odds of  a ½ percentage poi nt cut in the  funds
rate at this meeting.   Although conditions in some segments of financial market s have
improved in recent weeks, developments in the c ommercial paper and bank loan
markets indicate that suppliers of funds remain q uite wary.  Under these
circumstance s, the ef fects of  surprisi ng the markets wi th a smaller  easing could b e
especi ally ad verse.  
(17) The market respons e to a 50 basi s point reduct ion in the fe deral funds
rate would depend i mportantly on the  wording of the announc ement and balance  of
risks statement that accompanied the action.  Retaining  a statement of risks weighted
toward economic weakne ss would seem appropr iate if , in ligh t of the evi dent
softening i n demand and subdued readin gs on price and wage  inflati on, the
Comm ittee saw the po ssibility of below-tren d growth a s a more serio us problem  in
the foreseeable futu re than the cha nce of a rise in inflatio n.  Market p articipants
expect the C ommittee  to announ ce continued  unbalanced  risks toward ec onomic
weakness as w ell as to ease policy b y 50 basis points.  S till, markets migh t rally some if
participants see th is combinatio n as confirm ing that the Fed eral Reserve inte nded to
continue to c ounter econ omic wea kness relatively agg ressively.  The dollar  could
weaken on  foreign exchan ge markets as m ajor foreign cen tral banks are u nlikely to
15
match the Syste m easing at thi s time.  A sta tement that r isks were ba lanced would be
justified if the Com mittee thoug ht the 100 basis p oints of easing o ver the last mo nth
were likely to be sufficient to promote a rapid return to sustainab le growth, which
would keep labor m arkets relatively tight.  Such a statement would cause market
participa nts to reas sess the pr ospects f or future pol icy acti ons and roll bac k much of
the expe cted eas ing g oing forward .  In cons eque nce, asset prices could give bac k som e
of their r ecent gains  while the doll ar could even s trengthen a bi t on foreign e xchange
markets.
(18) The Committee may choose the  unchanged feder al funds rat e of
alternative B  if it is dissatisfied with recen t rates of core inflation  and wants to
establi sh a downward traje ctory for i nflation,  as in the pri ce stabil ity scena rio in the
second sect ion of this  bluebook.  The ra tionale f or this poli cy choice would be
strengthened  if the Com mittee saw th e recent slowd own in the  growth of a ggregate
demand as likely to be mo re temporary than does the staff and thus the recen t policy
easing as probably sufficient to counter the sluggishness in the econom y that emerged
recently.  Regard less of the balance o f risks statement, leavin g the funds rate
unchange d would c ome as a co nsiderable surp rise to market p articipants and w ould
spark a sel l-off i n asset market s as parti cipants re assesse d the economic outl ook and
the Comm ittee’s posture.  The backup in interest rates and drop in equity prices
would prom pt still more caution on the part of loan officers and investors.
(19) Under the Greenbook for ecast,  borrowing by the bus iness and
household sect ors combined over t he first  half of 200 1 is expect ed to stay a round the
reduced pa ce of the second  half of last year.  Con sumer cred it is projected to
decelerate further over the first half, largely reflecting weaker outlays on consumer
durables and  some rising ca ution by ho useholds exp eriencing unc omfortable  debt-
servicing burdens.  Recent declines in mortgag e rates are expected to spur continued
16
heavy mortgage r efinanci ng activit y, mostly t o reduce debt- servici ng costs on exi sting
debt but in a number of cases also to extr act some equity.  Lower bond rates and an
improved tone to the corp orate bond market already hav e begun to boost issuance;
going forward, overall business borrow ing should run som ewhat above the subdu ed
pace of the latter p art of last year, when  firms seemed  inclined to ho ld off on their
borrowing plans.  Business borro wing from banks is expected to m oderate, in part
reflecting the i ncreased reliance on bond offeri ngs but also the more restrict ive
posture of loan  officers.  Debt of no nfederal sectors is p rojected to gro w at about a
6½ percent rate from D ecember to June and total deb t to grow at a 4¼ percent rate,
held dow n by paydo wns of federal d ebt.
(20) M2 is projecte d to grow at a 5½ percent  annual rate ov er the Januar y-to-
June period under t he Greenbook forec ast, well  above the proje cted 2¾ percent
growth of nominal GDP over the  first ha lf of thi s year.  M2 growth s hould be
boosted relative to that of nominal incom e by the decline in short-term market rates
following the January policy easings and by a co ntinuation of the heightened
preference s of households  for the more st able asse ts that compri se M2.  Mortgage
refinancing activity  also is likely to lift M2  notably over th is period.  M3  is expected to
grow at a 7 perce nt annual rat e over the Ja nuary-to-J une period.  Growth of
institutional money funds is  projected to be quite brisk as  the yields on these funds l ag
the downward m ove in short-term market interest rates.
