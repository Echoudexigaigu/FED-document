The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from  the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserv e System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensiv e digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a re daction process that removed information obtained on a

1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not

(1) The Committee’s dec ision on Januar y 31 to reduce t he intended l evel of
the federal fund s rate by 50 basis p oints, to 5½ p ercent, and the an nouncem ent that it
viewed risks as re maining w eighted tow ard econom ic weakness w ere widely
anticipated and had little impact on m arket yields.1  Information  becoming  available
over the intermeeting period–particularly wid espread earnings disappointmen ts, sharp
declines in share prices, and a notable drop in consum er confidence–led  market
participa nts to mark down furt her their a nticipat ed path of the f ederal funds  rate.  The
market is now confident that the Committee will lower the f unds rate by at least 50
basis point s at the March meet ing and has pri ced in high odds of  a 75 basis poi nt
action.  Look ing further  ahead, fut ures contrac ts point to e xpectati ons that the f unds
rate will mov e down to  around 4¼  percent by the  fall (chart 1).
(2) Against this backdrop, the Treasury yield curve h as shifted lower over
the intermee ting period,  with short- term intere st rates  falling  50 basis poi nts and
longer-term yields dropping 30 to 50 b asis points.  Broad equity indexes have declined

profits outlook and unsettled prospects for corpo rate equities have put upward
pressure on private debt spreads in recent days, especially for lower-rated
corporation s.  As a conseq uence, rates on h igh-yield bond s have fallen only 1 0 basis
points, while tho se on the bon ds of better-rated c orporation s are off 35 to 45 b asis
points.  At commercial ban ks, many lending officers report they have again tightened
standards and terms on bu siness loans since the beginning of the year, raising the cost
and likely signaling the reduced availability of new loan com mitments.
(3) Bond yields and stock prices fell in most other indu strial countries over
the intermee ting period,  albeit ge nerally by  less than i n the United Stat es.  Stil l, the
dollar apprec iated in value on  foreign exchan ge markets, gain ing 3¾ pe rcent against a
basket of maj or currencie s (chart 2) .  The dollar  strengthene d most against t he
currencies  of countrie s where the pote ntial for  economic weakening was  seen to be
greatest, inc reasing 3¾ percent vis-a-v is the Canadian dollar and 5½ percent relati ve
to the Japanese yen.  Over the intermeeting p eriod, the Bank of Canada eased p olicy
by 50 basis poi nts, but marke t partici pants apparent ly harbored cons iderable c oncerns
that th is would be  insuff icient  to absor b the impac t on Canada of  a slowin g U.S.
economy.  The Ban k of Japan trimmed 10 b asis points from its call money rate, which
now stand s at 15 basis poin ts, and some o fficials hinted that m ore easing m ight be in
store.  But  with Japanese  equity pric es fall ing 13 percent  over the las t six weeks  and
raising doubt s about the banki ng sector,  the politi cal coali tion in power lo oking
fragile , and forward- looking indic ators point ing to very wea k domestic spen ding, the
prospects for eco nomic activity in  Japan seem  poor.  Ma rket participants a pparently
viewed the econ omic expansion i n Europe as more secure  and seemed unfazed by  the
European Central Bank keeping its policy on hold.  Nonetheless , the dollar gained 2¼
percent against the euro.  Over the interm eeting period,

(4) The dollar ro se ¾ percen t over the interm eeting period in  terms of a
basket of currencies of  our other important trading partners.   In Turkey, with a weak
banking syst em adding to press ures on government f inances and pol itical  tensions
flaring,  the central  bank was forced t o abandon its cr awling peg in l ate February.   The
dollar initial ly appreciated over 50 perce nt against the Turkish li ra but has
subsequently fallen back some to end  the period up about 30 p ercent.  The spillover
to other market s was containe d, with inve stors withdr awing for a ti me from the debt
of Argentin a, which has sim ilarly shaky finances a nd political trou bles.  On net,
spreads on Argenti nian debt edged l ower over the per iod, ref lecting c onfidence i n the
new finance minister.  But with the ou tlook for the global economy loo king poorer
and investors so mewhat m ore skittish, spreads o n emerging  market deb t rose 65 basis
points o n net.  Emer ging marke t equit y price s have f ollowed U. S. market s down but
have dropped som ewhat less on balance.
(5) Falling interest rates have contributed to rapid growth in th e monetary
aggre gates  in rec ent mont hs.  M2 e xpande d at a 1 0¾ perce nt rat e in Fe bruary , down
only a little from its J anuary pace, w ith the strength in  both mo nths concen trated in its
liquid components  (see chart  2).  In addi tion to decl ines in it s opportunity  cost, th e
robust growth of M2 thi s year may ref lect the a ppeal of saf e, short- term assets , given 
volatile equity markets and the yield advantage of m oney funds relative to longer-term
investments.  M2 also was lift ed somewhat last month by a pickup in mortgage loan
prepayments,  the proceeds  of which are t emporarily hel d in bank deposit s, and by
larger than usual tax ref unds.  M3 growth, too, remained strong in February, at  an
11½ percent rate, supported by a su rge in institutional money market fund s, whose
yields lagged the declines in money m arket rates.
4
(6) Businesses  have taken adva ntage of lower  long-term int erest rat es and a
receptive  bond market since  early in t he year to i ssue a huge vol ume of bonds, a good
chunk of which has been  earmarked to pay dow n commercial paper.  M any lower-
rated commercial paper issuers, facing reluctant investors and elevated interest rates,
also have turned to comm ercial banks.  Bank lending to businesses has been rob ust
since the t urn of the yea r, despit e the report ed further t ightening of  standards and
terms since  then.  On net, bus iness borrowi ng appears to be  growing about in l ine
with the pace of  late las t year.  Lower  interest  rates al so have buoyed the  mortgage
market, supporting househo ld borrowing, which w as augmented by robu st consumer
debt growth early in the year.   State and local governments, too,  have moved to take
advantage of f avorable int erest rat es by steppi ng up issuance,  only partly  for refundi ng
purposes.  O verall, growth o f debt of the no nfederal sectors ear ly this year appear s to
have edged down from its pace of the last quarter  of 2000, while growth of total
domestic no nfinancial debt h as been abou t maintained  owing to so me mo deration in
the contraction  of federal debt.

Policy Alternatives
(7) In the staf f forecas t, an inve ntory correc tion intens ifies f urther in the
current quarter, holding output to a very sm all increase.  With inventories better
aligned with sales by the second half of the year and the effects of policy
easings–i ncluding anothe r 50 basis poi nts assumed to oc cur at this  meeting–working
their way thr ough to spending,  output growth gradua lly picks  up.  Although
consumption gets a lift from the expected d ecline of energy prices and the assumed
retroacti ve tax cut,  the deteri oration in t he net worth of hous eholds damps the
rebound.  In vestment de mand reco vers gradually, sup ported by co ntinued rap id
growth in str uctural prod uctivity.  The staff assum ption that po licy will be on h old
over the rem ainder of the for ecast period im plies a path for th e funds rate that is
higher than e xpected by th e financial mark ets, contributing to  some back up in
nominal lo ng-term inter est rates, a decline in eq uity prices, and a m ore mod erate
depreciat ion in the doll ar.  Partl y as a conseque nce, the gr owth of aggregat e demand
rises sl owly over coming quart ers and approac hes that of  aggregate s upply only by t he
end of the for ecast peri od.  The extende d period of subpar  growth result s in the
unempl oyment  rate rising to abou t 5½ pe rcent, produc ing a  small  drop i n core  PCE
inflation in 2002 from this year’s projected 2 percent pace.
(8) The Committee could select a 50 basis point re duction  in the funds
rate at t his meeting  if it thought an e asing of at least this size  would pr ove necessary to
promote a return of  economic growth to an a cceptable  pace over ti me.  The result ing
5 percent federal funds ra te would imply a real rate of around 3 percent–as suming that
inflation expectatio ns are in line with  the staff forecast of core  PCE p rices.  Even if
this places the real rate  below its long -run equilibriu m value, an u ndershoot m ay well
be needed for a t ime to counter t he effect s of the decl ines in equi ty wealth,  the
apparent do wnward  revision to exp ected near-term  returns on cap ital, a possible
7
overh ang o f prod uctive  capac ity, and  lower  busin ess and  consu mer c onfid ence. 
Although the cumulati ve reduction i n the funds rat e of 1½ percentag e points si nce the
start of  the year would r epresent a s harp and substant ial change i n the stance  of
policy, aggregate d emand an d attitudes hav e deteriorated q uickly.  The relatively r apid
lesseni ng of pressur es in labor mark ets now like ly in trai n should counter a ny
tendency for inflati on to move higher.  If the Committee suspected that addit ional
easing might be needed at some point, it might s till prefer t o move by no more than
50 basis points a t this meeting so  that it could be tter assess the initial respo nse to its
previo us acti ons, th e und erlying  streng th of d eman d, and  the ext ent of p rice pr essure s. 
In those cir cumstances,  the Committee pres umably would want to ret ain the curr ent
statement that the risks are weighted toward econ omic weakness.  The C ommittee
could also re tain that s tatement if  it belie ved that 50 bas is points c ould well be
suffici ent to achie ve its obje ctives,  but saw the ris ks to that out look as skewed t o the
downside.   
(9) Market partic ipants evi dently expec t at leas t a 50 basis  point cut in t he
target funds  rate at t his meeting,  with federal  funds future s rates s uggesting hi gh odds
that the re duction will  be 75 basis poi nts.  Part icipants  also report edly expect  the
Comm ittee to state that the b alance of risks rem ains weighted  toward eco nomic
weakness.  Th erefore, a 50 basis po int move co mbined w ith such a statem ent likely
would cause interest rates to back up.  Price declines migh t be larger in equity markets,
wher e inves tors se em to  be ho ping f or esp ecially  aggre ssive F edera l Rese rve act ion. 
Further easi ngs in the st ance of monetary  policy over  time would continue  to be
anticipated, and current  market expectations that t he funds rate could be around 4¼
percen t later th is year m ight n ot be m aterial ly affect ed. 
(10) The Com mittee could decide to reduce the target federal funds rate even
more at this meeting–choosing a 75 basis point decrea se–if it saw the ou tcome in
8
the staff forecast as plau sible and con sistent with its objec tives but subject to
excessive downside risks.  Sources of risk include the possibility of substantial further
decreases in equ ity prices and tigh tening in credit c onditions as p rofits continue to  fall,
and fragility in consumer and bu siness confidence.  In addition, recent profit and sales
shortfalls in the technology sector could indicate a considerable overhan g of high-tech
capital throug hout the eco nomy or  even a slower  pace of structur al productivity
grow th go ing f orwa rd.  Eith er case woul d wea ken i nves tmen t spending for some t ime
and probably nece ssitat e signifi cant monetary pol icy ease.   Thus, a 75 basi s point
reduction in  the fund s rate at this time c ould be ap prop riate to pro vide some
protection against the possibility of a prolonged period of econ omic weakness.  Even
if the Committee  does not see i nordinate downsi de risks t o the staf f forecas t, it might
view that f orecast as  involving unac ceptably weak  output and employment,  justify ing a
greater easing th an assumed  by the staff.  In the G reenbook, the  unemplo yment rate
rises no ticeab ly abo ve the l evel th e staff ju dges to  be con sistent  with s table in flation . 
Moreov er, the Com mittee may se e good od ds that the econ omy can su stainably
operate at a no ticeably lower lev el of unemp loyment tha n is embed ded in the staff
forecast , and want to l ean against  appreciabl e increase s in unemployment abs ent
clearer  eviden ce that  such in crease s are ne cessary  to con tain in flation .   
(11) A 75 basis point easing, if  accompanied by a statement that the ris ks
remain w eighted tow ard econom ic weakness, wo uld generate so me price gain s in both
the fixed incom e and equity m arkets.  But, given th e skittishness in finan cial markets
and the possibility t hat the stock adjustment process  for capital and inventori es may
have a ways to run, the Committee might still s ee a preponderance of downside risks
to the economy, even after the 75 basis point m ove and the likely reaction in asset
mark ets. 
9
(12) In developing i ts foreca st, the s taff has  placed consi derable weight  on
the recent  deteriora tion in consumer c onfidence and e quity wealth .  If, instead,  the
Committee put more emphasis  on the relat ively fi rm indicators  on spending and
employment of lat e, it might  view the fore cast of out put in the Greenbook  as too
pessimistic.  In that ca se, it might think th at less easing is called for  than assum ed in
the staf f forecas t and much less t han is anti cipated by t he market, i nclining i t to favor
a sma ller, 25 basis po int reduc tion in the targe t funds rate .  Moreover, t he
disquieti ng readings on con sumer prices f or January might c ounsel cauti on in lowering
the funds rate further.  Given the sizable easing already undertaken  this year, a more
gradual app roach to furth er reductions in  the funds rate m ay now be a ppropriate, in
part to  allow  time t o gau ge the  effects o f the po licy act ions in  the pip eline. 
(13) Market pa rticipants wou ld be surprised  by an easing o f only 25 basis
points, and de bt and equ ity markets wo uld sell off apprec iably–and ev en more sh arply
if this  action were c ombined with a shif t to a stat ement of balanc ed risks.   But if the
Comm ittee saw considerably more underlying streng th in the real economy or greater
inflati on risks tha n did market part icipants , it might v iew as appropri ate the res ulting
reassess ment of the tra jectory of  expected poli cy and the conse quent tighte ning of
financ ial con dition s. 
(14) Under the staff forecas t, including the ass umed 50 basis point easing at
this meeting, the debt of domesti c nonfinancial sectors  is projected to grow at a 5½
percent rat e over the per iod from January t o June.  Sluggi sh economic growth and
declining pr ofits may make l enders somewhat more c autious, but  a signifi cant
decrease i n credit ava ilabili ty is not f oreseen,  and the debt of bo rrowers other  than the
federal gov ernm ent is projected to inc rease at an 8 per cent annu al rate over  the same
interval.  This  latter grow th rate far exceeds the 3½ per cent pace  of no mina l GDP
growth forese en for the f irst hal f of this  year.  For hous eholds, t he expansion of
10
mortgage debt is  expected to be  well maintai ned, refl ecting the  influence  of low
mortgage interest rates on housing activity and m ortgage refinancing.  Consum er
credit growt h, by contra st, is seen as moderat ing signif icantly,  as consumer outl ays on
durable goods are projected to be weak.  Busines s debt growth should remain hefty as
external financin g needs con tinue to be sub stantial, owing in  part to the we akness in
profit s.  
(15) Under the Greenbook assessment of the likely e volution of nominal
income and inter est rate s, the st aff expec ts M2 growth to moderate  to a 7½ percent
pace over the  February-to- June interva l.  Fall ing market int erest rat es, mortgage
prepayment activity, and attractive returns on mon ey funds relative to longer-term
instruments a re project ed to lift  M2 growth in the near- term.  However, t his boost,  on
balance, is smaller th an in the first two  months o f the year, as the decline s in short-
term i nteres t rates a re assu med t o slow  from  their p ace aro und t he tur n of th e year. 
M3 grow th, projected at a 7 p ercent pace ov er the Februa ry-to-June interv al, is
supported by fur ther strong e xpansion of i nstituti onal money funds f ollowing the
assumed easing  action at t his meeting.
