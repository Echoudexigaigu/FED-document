The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from  the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserv e System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensiv e digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a re daction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redact ed passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    
 
                                                
 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and we re not checked or corrected by staff. 
  1.   Over the  intermeeting p eriod, federal fu nds have trad ed at rates near the  target levels. 
The Desk redeemed $11.8 bil lion of Treas ury securit ies, inc luding $7.5 bi llion of bi lls and
$4.4 billion of coupon securiti es, to continue bringing SOMA holdings into conformance
with the guidelines on per-issue limits.  To offset the resulting reserve drain and m eet longer-
term reserve needs, the Desk purchased outright  $13.6 billion of Treasury coupon securit ies
in the market and $ 486 million of Trea sury bill s from foreig n customers.  The vol ume of
outstanding lo ng-term R Ps was kep t unchange d at $12.0 billion .  Strictly C onfide ntial (F .R.) May 10, 2001

Recent D evelopm ents
(1) The 50-basis-point reduction in the target federal funds rate at the 
March 20 meeting was l ess than some i nvestors had e xpected, but  the accompanying
statement c ontri buted t o expec tations tha t an in termee ting e ase wou ld fol low.1  Those
expectati ons gradually  diminished over  subsequent weeks  as incoming data  and
statements by several Feder al Reserve officia ls evidently were read by i nvestors as
suggesting l ess weakness  in the economy goin g forward.  Thus,  the 50-basi s-point
reduction in th e federal funds ra te on Apr il 18 caught inv estors by surprise .  Short-
term intere st rates  declined i n response,  as market part icipants  marked down the
expected path of the federal funds rate over the next year or so.  M ore recently,
surprisingly w eak employ ment data a dded to the a mount o f near-term easin g built
into asset  prices.   Futures rate s currentl y indicate  that market pa rticipant s expect th e
federal f unds rate to be  cut another 50  basis point s at the May meeti ng to 4 percent
and to decline to about 3¾ percent by fall–- about ½ percentage point lower than was
anticipat ed before the  March meeting (char t 1).  On balanc e over the in termeeting
period, short-term  interest rates fell ½ to  1 percentage p oint.
(2) Despite the s harp decline  in short-t erm interest  rates,  longer-te rm yields
rose on balance over the intermeeting p eriod.  Most of the increase occurred before

  2.  Some of the increase in the ten- and  thirty-year nominal constant maturity Treasury
yields re flected a de cline in t he on-the-run pr emium that is t ypical of t he Treasury auct ion
schedule .  At the  ten-ye ar maturi ty, the narrowi ng of thi s premium is  estimat ed to have
added about 10 basis  points to t he increase i n the constant  maturity yi eld over the
intermeeting p eriod. the intermeetin g policy mo ve, as investors beca me mo re confident tha t output gro wth
will pick up; the growing likelihood of substantial federal tax cuts also m ay have added
pressure on long-term yields.  Although  yields on longer-term nom inal Treasury
securities increased nearly ½ percentage point, those on com parable inflation-indexed
securities drifted lower.2  The implied run-up in inflation compensation lef t that
measure ab ove the levels ob served before its sh arp decline in late  2000 associated  with
emerging w eakness in the eco nomy.  Th e improved  sentiment ab out the econ omic
outlook and the s urprise int ermeeting poli cy easing may ha ve contribut ed to a
narrowing of ri sk premiums, es pecially  on lower-grade c orporate debt  securiti es, and
to a rise i n stock pric es.  Equity mark ets were al so bolster ed by first -quarter ea rnings
reports,  which generall y came in above sha rply reduced e xpectati ons, alt hough
analysts  continued to l ower forecas ts for ear nings in subs equent quarter s.  Over the
intermeeting  period, the W ilshire 5000 index  gained mo re than 7½  percent, leaving it
abou t 5 perc ent be low it s year-e nd lev el. 
(3) Equity prices and long-term yields r ose in other industrial c ountries as
well, likely  reflecting in part  the importance of the United States f or the global
economy and the perc eived improvement i n prospects f or globally  important
industries, including those in the high-technology area.  The increase in equ ity prices
was particularly large in Japan–about 15 p ercent–reflecting in part a favorable market
reaction t o the Bank of Japa n’s announcement of  policy change s the day bef ore the
March FOMC m eeting,  which included a  return to a ze ro interes t rate ta rget, and t he
formation of the new Koizumi-led government in late April.  Short-t erm yields abroad

generally declined,  although by less than in the United Stat es.  The European Central
Bank ended its “wait and see” p olicy recently with a 25-basis-point cut in its policy
rates.   The reduction ca me amid increasi ng indicati ons of economic weak ness in the
euro area and despite some signs o f increased inflationary pressure.  Policy rates also
were cu t by 25  basis  point s in Can ada and  Switze rland  and by 5 0 basi s poin ts in two
steps in the United Kingdo m since the March F OMC  meeting.  The dollar appreciated
against a basket of major currencies early in the intermeeting period , but it later
retraced that m ovement, pa rticularly after the FO MC’s sur prise interest rate cut in
mid-April, and f inished the  intermeeti ng period about uncha nged (chart 2) .            
                                                                                                                              over the
intermeeting period         U.S. authorities did no t intervene.
(4) The dollar was al so essenti ally unchange d on balance agai nst a basket  of
currencies of our other important trading  partners.  Argentine financial markets were
roiled by growi ng uncertaint ies about the  country’s  financial  situati on and speculat ion
that its exchange rate peg might be m odified, as well as by an open dispute between
the A rgent ine go vernm ent an d cent ral ban k over  the us e of res erve re quire ment s. 
Market pressures spilled over to Brazil, where the real fell al most 5 percent a gainst the
dollar .  Risk s preads on  dollar -denomina ted Argent ine and Bra zilian debt moved up
sharply.  In contrast, the Mexican peso appreciated abo ut 4 percent against the dollar,
as monetary aut horities  held to thei r tight poli cy stance,  and spreads on Mexic an debt
narrowed.  The Turk ish lira regained some of its previously lost ground, and T urkish
financial markets calmed, as the country’s financial problems appeared  to have been
brought under bett er control pa rtly in re sponse to the  prospect of a dditional f unding
from the IM F and W orld Bank.  T he Indone sian rupiah an d the Philipp ine peso both
declined sharp ly against the do llar in reaction to fin ancial problem s and dom estic
political turmo il.

(5) The debt of nonfederal sectors i n the United States is est imated to have
advanced at a round an  8 percent rate o n average ove r March a nd April, ab out equal to
its robust pace of the second half of 2000 and early 2001 (see chart 2).  Ho wever,
growth of b usiness debt fell ba ck in recent m onths, likely reflecting a  reduction in
inventory a nd ca pital inves tmen t and in me rger and  acqu isition act ivity.  Firms
continued to  borrow h eavily in the corp orate bond  market, but th ey reduced th eir
reliance on sho rt-term financin g markets.  C omme rcial paper ou tstanding ran  off
further in  March and April, al beit at a much s lower pace tha n earlier  in the year , and
business l oans at commercial  banks also dec lined very  recently , possibl y damped by
the further tighteni ng of credit conditions indic ated in the most recent Senior Loan
Officer Opinion s urvey.  Househol d borrowing also ha s showed some signs  of
slowing in recent months.  G rowth in consum er credit declined moderately in Ma rch
and is estimated to have slowed furt her in April, as outlays on durable  goods appear
to have fal len back fr om the surprisi ngly strong pa ce early i n the year.   Mortgage debt
growth, by co ntrast, seems to h ave largely sustaine d its rapid pace, reflectin g strength
in the residential  housing sector and substantial  refinancing activi ty.  State and local
government borro wing picked up further in M arch and April, as lower interest rates
fueled advan ce refunding o f existing debt.  Th e federal govern ment, in con trast, paid
down a considerable amount of debt in April, which pulled down the growth of total
domestic nonfi nancial debt  that month.
(6) Spurred by the drop i n its opportuni ty cost,  M2 expanded at an avera ge
pace of 12½  percent over M arch and A pril, with particula r strength in liqu id deposits
and retail  money funds.  M2 growth was boos ted by sever al specia l factors , includi ng
extensive  mortgage refi nancing acti vity and,  in April, hous eholds' ac cumulation of
liquid balances to make nonwithheld tax payments,  which increased by more than
allowed for b y seasonal factors.  In a ddition, portfo lio flows into safe, liqu id assets

Policy Alternatives
(7) The staff f orecast f or this meeti ng embodies a weaker  outlook for
aggregate de mand than in the March Greenbook , refl ecting in pa rt incoming
information s uggesting l ower-than-e xpected tra jectorie s for inves tment and
consump tion spendin g.  With pro jected spendin g on capital eq uipment so fter than in
the last forecast and estimates of multifactor productivity growth over recen t years
revised down, the staff  has trimmed its estimate of the gr owth of structural
productivit y somewhat, which f urther damps prospe ctive aggr egate demand.  The
staff ha s assumed that  the Federal Res erve will r espond to this  more negative out look
by easing policy  50 basis points a t this meeting.  T hereafter, the federal fu nds rate is
held u nchan ged at  a level o ne per centag e poin t below  that o f the las t Gree nboo k.  
Earnings disappointm ents are expected to trigger some near-term declines in stock
prices,  but long-ter m interest r ates and the  dollar are  expected to hol d near current
levels gi ven this pol icy path.   The impetus provide d by the cumulati ve policy e asings
and the support t o investment an d real income f rom continuing ef ficienc y gains
engendered by new t echnologies  contribute t o a strengthe ning of the gr owth of
spending over t he forecas t period.  I n addition,  fiscal  stimulus spur s consumption
demand  beginning late r this year.  By the en d of the projec tion period, eco nomic
growth rises  back to a rat e close to t hat of its  potential .  With slack e merging in labor
and product mark ets and energy prices declining, core PCE inflation slips back u nder
2 perc ent in 2 002.  
(8) In considerin g the approp riate stance of policy , it may be useful to
compare the real  federal f unds rate with e stimates of  the current  level of t he
equilibrium  real federal funds  rate.  The equilib rium rate is defin ed here to be th e rate
that, i f maintained,  eventuall y would return output  to potentia l once the ef fects of  any
transitory disturb ances have dissip ated.  Thus, the eq uilibrium rea l federal funds rate

  3.  All measures  of the real  federal funds  rate are ca lculated us ing the core  PCE inflation
rate over t he previous four  quarters a s a proxy for expec ted infla tion.
  4.  Note that since expected infl ation is assumed to equal past act ual inflation, a gi ven
change in the  nomina l federal funds ra te target translates into an e qual imm ediate change  in
the real federal funds ra te.reflects the longer-term forces shaping the outlook for the real econom y and so
provi des one  benchma rk for  judgi ng the i mplica tions  of al terna tive polic y stances.   To
be sure, the appropriate stance of policy relative to that equilibrium rate in a given
instance wi ll depend on poli cymakers’ obj ectives , the curr ent level s of output and
inflati on, and an ass essment of th e transit ory factor s that may inf luence the pa ths of
inflation and output over the next few years.

real federal funds rate, as well as the actual real funds rate and its historical average.3

Two are derived f rom the FRB/US model; two others a re calcul ated from the
relationship be tween the real fu nds rate and th e output gap  using a statistical filter to
separate perm anent chang es in that relationsh ip from tem porary deviatio ns.  In both
of these appro aches, one estim ate is based on h istorical data wh ile the other aug ments
these data with  the staff forecast throu gh 2002.  A fifth  estimate, which  begins in
1998, is  inferred f rom actual index ed debt yiel ds.  As can be se en in the char t, the
estimates  imply some decli ne in the equil ibrium rate ove r recent quar ters, l ikely owing
in pa rt to the  long er-term eff ects on d emand  of an inc rease in the  equi ty premi um,
which reduces wea lth, and of  a slowing in t he growth of potent ial output,  which holds
down the expansion of   permanent real  income and earning s.  The FOMC’s current
target for the nominal funds rate  implies a real federa l funds rate of about 2¾
percent–around the low er end of the range.  The chart also shows the real fun ds rates

(10) If the Committee, like the st aff, antici pates a prolonged period of weak
aggregate demand, it might cho ose the 50 basis point re duction  in the target federal
funds rate assumed in the staf f forecast.   While such a reduction would leave the real
funds rate noticeably bel ow the range of the estimates of i ts equilibrium value, an
accommod ative policy stance may be seen as needed for a time to co unter temporary
restraints o n aggrega te demand.   In parti cular t he Committee  may be conce rned about
household spending in an  environment of a weaken ing job market and abo ut business
investment out lays in vi ew of the drags  from the previ ous slowdown in fin al demand
and the over -accumulatio n of capital in som e sectors.  In these circu mstances, grow th
would remain slugg ish for a time even after further policy easing, lessening pressures
on resources a nd likely r olling back  the recent  upticks in i nflation a nd inflati on
expecta tions.   Indeed,  the Committe e may view t he resour ce gap li kely t o open up
under this scenario as si zable enough to imply a margin in which spending could snap
back faste r than expect ed without produci ng a deterior ation in the  inflati on
environm ent.  Market p articipants already  expect a substan tial reversal of policy in
2002 , suggesting tha t they wo uld b e pro mpte r than us ual in br inging forwa rd in time
and increasing the size of the anticipated tightening if evidence of such a snap-ba ck
emerged.  As long as  the Committee rei nforced such s entiment with i ts words and
actions,  the result ing increas e in real i nterest r ates would work to s tabilize  the
econo my an d con strain i nflatio n. 
(11) Investors are exp ecting a 50 basis p oint move  at this meeting, alo ng with
a statement ind icating that the b alance of risks rem ains weighted  toward eco nomic
weakness, t o be followed by a n additional  25 basis poi nt move by fall .  Validati ng
market expect ations for  this meeti ng would leave in terest r ates, e quity price s, and the
foreign exchan ge value of the d ollar largely unch anged.  The C ommittee  may find this
outcome especially attractive if it believes that the balance of risks is sufficiently tilt ed
10
toward w eakness to m ake the added  policy easing bu ilt into asset prices a reaso nable
possibility.
(12) The Com mittee migh t choose a m ore mod est 25 basis point re duction
in the federal funds rat e at this meeting if i t views aggregate demand going forward as
likely t o be noticeabl y less weak t han in the st aff fore cast, pe rhaps because  it sees t he
large cumulative easing of policy since the start of the year as providing m ore support
for demand than in t hat foreca st.  Among financi al indicat ors, the r apid growth of
money an d the steepness o f the yield curve m ay suggest that co nsiderable stim ulus is
already in  place.  I n these cir cumstances,  with the real  funds rate a t the low end of t he
range of estimates of its equilibrium level, and with equity m arkets having risen
appreciably over the intermeeting period, the C ommittee may believe that a m ore
forceful policy action at this meeting would create unaccep table odds of a policy
overshoot, w ith potentially ad verse consequ ences for inflation.  C oncerns in this
regard might be a ccentuated by  the recent  firmer tone of  the infla tion data and t he
increases  in survey and mark et measures of  expected inf lation.   Thus, even if  the
Comm ittee suspects that ad ditional easing m ight well be ap propriate at som e point, it
might cho ose a smaller p olicy step at this m eeting to allow  time for mo re evidence to
accumulate on wh ether the economy will be soft enou gh to contain inflation pressures
and w arran t addi tional  easing . 
(13) Market participants would b e surprised by a 25 basis point easing.  Even
if such a pol icy move is ac companied by a sta tement that t he balance of  risks re mains
weighted toward econ omic weakness, short-term interest rates would rise as investors
marked up their e xpectati ons for the pat h of the fede ral funds ra te over coming
months.  Higher interest rates, together with a sense that mo netary policy is less
focused on fostering a return to robust econ omic growth, wou ld lead to a fall in stock
prices.  If the drop in equity prices is quite substantial, longer-term interest rates also
11
might declin e, reflecting the weak er outlook fo r the econom y.  These effects in
financial  markets would be at tenuated if , in ligh t of the st atement accompanyi ng the
policy announce ment, the Feder al Reserve i s seen more as s tretching  out the timing of
its polic y moves than as r educing the t otal amount of ea sing that wi ll be fort hcoming.
(14) If the Com mittee believes th at the outlook  for aggregate d emand is
probably weaker than in the staff forecast, or that the risks around that forecast are
skewed substantially t o the downside, it might choose a 75 basis point re duction  in
the target federal funds rate.  Such weakness could ow e, for example, to a more
protracted f alloff i n high-tech i nvestment as bus inesses r econsider t he profita bility of
these capi tal projec ts, which i n turn would damp struct ural producti vity growth and
be reflected in a m ore prono unced declin e in the equilibriu m real fund s rate.  Even if
the Committee agrees with the staff f orecast of output and employment, it st ill may
view their projected paths a s unacceptably weak, just ifying a larger cut  in the federal
funds rate t han is assumed i n that forec ast.  For e xample, the Committe e may think
that the unem ployment r ate does not n eed to rise as m uch or as qu ickly as in the staff
foreca st to ke ep infl ation i n chec k. 
(15) A 75 basis p oint easing acco mpanied  by a statemen t that the risks rem ain
weighted toward e conomic weakness woul d lower the expe cted near- term path of
policy, reducing other shorter-term interest rates and easing financial conditions m ore
generally.  The larger-than-expected policy move w ould presumably bo lster
expec tation s of eco nom ic grow th and  corpo rate ea rning s, boos ting sto ck pric es. 
Effects on long er-term nom inal interest rates are less cle ar.  Such rates w ould tend to
be pulled down by th e change in near-term policy expectations and th e associated
decline in real inter est rates, but that tend ency could b e more than  offset by a rise in
inflation premiums if market parti cipants read the larger -than-expected policy move as
increa sing th e odd s of a sig nifican t picku p in in flation . 
12
(16) Although m arket participants expect the Comm ittee to retain its view
that the bal ance of ris ks is weight ed toward economic weak ness, the  Committee might
believe t hat the lev el of rate s select ed at this mee ting is suf ficient ly low to bala nce the
risks of e conomic weakness wi th those of i ncreased in flation pr essures.   If, for
example, rat es are cut by  50 or 75 basis  points, t he Committee might vie w the
resulting real federal funds rate of 2¼ or 2 percent as low en ough to make the 
reduced risks of economic wea kness comparable to the increased risks of higher
inflati on.  Most invest ors would probably  read a shif t by the Committee t o a
statement of balanced risks  as indicating that t he current cycle of poli cy easing had
ended.  As a r esult, a combin ation of a 50 ba sis point policy m ove and a sh ift to
balanced risks would cause inter est rates to back up and stock pri ces to decline, as
inves tors t ake out  the ad ditional e asing  that h ad been  expec ted in  the ne ar term.  By
contrast, a 75 basis point reduction in the target federal funds rate accomp anied by a
statement of b alanced risks w ould tend to  lower interest rate s a little, since it would
move up the timing  of policy easing that is already expected, and boost stock prices
slightly.  However, market par ticipants might view a move to balanced ris ks as
suggesting t hat the Committee coul d be less l ikely to r eact quickl y to future s igns of
econom ic weakness, in w hich case stock p rices might slip, cau sing long-term  rates to
fall a bi t furth er. 
(17) Under the  staff forecast, a significant furth er tightening o f credit
conditions i s not antic ipated in coming  quarters,  although with t he economy soft a nd
profits not  rebounding, l enders are l ikely to r emain cautious .  The expansi on of
domestic nonfi nancial se ctor debt is  projected t o slow to about a 5 pe rcent pace f rom
April to December.   Expected feder al surpluse s result i n further subs tantial p aydowns
of Treasury debt in coming months before the need to finance  the projected tax
rebate requi res the Trea sury to temporar ily become a net  borrower.  Nonfede ral debt

growth is proje cted to moderate  some, but it r emains conside rably fas ter than the
expansion in  nominal sp ending.  Alth ough m ortgage grow th is expected to r emain
brisk, hous ehold debt growth s hould slow as weake r consumption spendi ng damps
the expansion of consumer credit.  Busi ness borrowing also is antici pated to soften, as
a widening  of the gap betw een internally gen erated funds an d capital expen ditures in
the second half of the year is more than offset by a reduction in eq uity retirements.
(18) Under the Greenbook forecast, M2 is projected to expand at a 5 ½
percen t pace f rom A pril to  Dece mber , well b elow i ts aver age rat e in rec ent m onths . 
The deceleration owes in part to the proj ected slowdown in the growth of nominal
spending and the  waning effec ts of poli cy easings  on opportunity c osts.  I n addition,
some of the spec ial fact ors that have  boosted M2 growth of la te–includi ng mortgage
refinancing an d tax-season effects, an d perhaps so me safe haven  flows out of eq uity
markets–are  expected to u nwind ov er coming m onths.  M3  growth is pr ojected to
decline to a  7 percent pac e over the April -to-December per iod, ref lecting t he
moderation in M2 expansion and smaller increases in ins titutional money funds as
their r ates ad just to  lower  mark et inter est rate s.
