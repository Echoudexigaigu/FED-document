The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from  the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserv e System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensiv e digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a re daction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redact ed passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    
 
                                                
 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and we re not checked or corrected by staff.

the announcement of  a 50 basis poi nt easing at  the May 15 FOMC meeting.2  Market
participants evidently were placing some odd s on a 25 basis point move or at least
were anticipating an indication that the Com mittee might subsequently slow  the pace
of easing.  Since th e meeting, new s on econom ic activity and corp orate earnings– both

As a consequence, the trajectory for the expected fund s rate shifted down further,
triggeri ng declines  in other money market  rates,  which ended the i ntermeeting pe riod

(3)  The dollar’ s value agai nst the curr encies of o ther important  trading
partners edg ed up on net over the  intermeeti ng period.  I n early June,  Argentina
swapped shorter -term for l onger-term debt  to reduce it s debt-ser vicing burden i n the
near term.  Even though  this exchange required generous lon ger-term yields to entice
a large vol ume of propositi ons, sprea ds on Argentine dol lar-denominat ed debt
declined subs tantiall y from their l evels in mid- May.  In mid-June,  Argentina
introduced an exchange-rate-linked system o f export subsidies and import taxes,
which effectively  lowered the value of the peso for t raded goods but kept the dollar
peg for other types of transactions.  The implem entation of this program led to fears
that it was a prelude to a full devaluation, and financial markets erased som e earlier
gains , leaving  Argenti ne bond s preads  over c omparabl e U.S.  Treas ury se curit ies do wn
only about 120 bas is points f or the inter meeting period a s a whole.  The Bra zilian real
was battered o ver the interm eeting period b y spillovers from  Argentina , problems in
the energy sector aris ing from drought, and domestic political s candals, but central
bank intervention and a tightening of m onetary policy in late June helped the currency
to bat tle bac k and  end th e perio d dow n only  abou t 3½ p ercent  versu s the d ollar. 
Benefitting from  continued fo reign interest in M exican investm ents and high  oil
prices,  Mexico’s curr ency appreci ated about 1½ perce nt against  the dollar,  while the
yield spread of Mexican sovereign deb t over Treasuries declined about 30 basis points.
(4) The debt o f nonfederal secto rs has continu ed to increase at a  good clip
in recent months , expanding at  about a 6½ percent a nnual rate i n April and, bas ed on
preliminary d ata, at a somew hat faster pace in M ay.  With bo nd marke ts quite
receptive and long-term rates viewed as attractive, nonfinancial businesses borrow ed
huge amoun ts in the bond market in M ay, and data for early June suggest another
strong month.  A porti on of this i ssuance was us ed to repay bank  loans and
commercial paper, but much of it represented new fi nancing as internal funds have
4
dropped o ff.  Although th e growth o f household  debt is projected  to slow to ab out a
7¼ percent annual rate for the second quarter a s a whole, it remains higher t han that
of disposable income, pushing up  debt-servicing burdens despite declines in consum er
loan rates.  Prob lems servicing d ebt continue d to increase in ce rtain market se gments
but restraint on  credit supplies h as been quite lim ited.  State and loc al governm ents
have c ontin ued to  raise fu nds at  a rapid  clip, esp ecially  for ne w cap ital pro jects. 
Outstanding m arketable debt of the federal government shran k substantially further
over the intermeeting period.   From the fourth quarter of 2000 through May 2001,
total nonfinancial debt i s estimated to have expanded at about a 4½ percent annual
rate, only slightly faster th an the projected  growth of n ominal G DP over th e first half
of the year.
(5) M2 growth slowed in May, as a large amount of final individual tax
payments clea red, but has  rebounded smartly  in June to an es timated 8¼ percent
annual rate (chart 3).   On a quarterly average basis, t herefore, M2 has hardly slowed at
all this quarter.  O verall, from the fo urth quarter  of last year throug h June, M 2 is
estimated t o have grown at about a  10 percent pac e, bolst ered important ly by the
reduction in the opportunity costs of hold ing liquid deposits and mon ey market
mutual funds engende red by five  policy eas ings in quick  successi on.  Moreover, a  drop
in mortgage rat es, which beg an about a year a go, had progres sed far enough by  the
end of 2000 to ki ck off a wave of  refinanci ng that elev ated M2 this yea r, as the
proceeds earm arked to pay o ff previously secur itized mortg ages were tem porarily held
in escrow in M2 deposi t accounts.   A further inf luence support ing M2 growth in the
first pa rt of the ye ar may have been t he reduced att ractivene ss and great er volati lity of
stock marke t returns.  M3  growth, wh ich has com e down fro m Apr il’s unusually
strong pace, is still quite robust.  Institution-only money funds, which expand ed

Longer-Term Strategies
(6) This secti on examines some impli cations of  the Greenbook outlo ok for
longer-te rm strategi es for monetar y policy and c onsiders t he implicati ons for polic y of
alternative possibilities for productivity growth.  The experiments are constructed
from a baseline scenario in which the  Greenbook forecast is extended through 2006
using the FRB/US model, with certain judgmental adjustments to the model that
preserve the cen tral features und erlying the staff outlo ok.  Potential ou tput grow th in
the baseline is drive n by several key co nsiderations:  M ultifactor prod uctivity growth
continues at  its 2002 pac e; overal l investment  in capital  equipment accel erates bey ond
the Greenbook horizon,  buoying the expa nsion of capi tal servi ces; and t he degree of
labor market s lack consi stent with s table inf lation (t he effect ive NAIRU) rises fr om
about 5¼ percent in 200 2 to 5½ percent by 2005.  Taking  all these factors together,
the rate of  increase i n potential  output is a t ad above 3½ percent a fter 2003,  a slight
rise from thi s year and next .  Growth abroad st rengthens to  3¾ percent by 2003,  and
the dollar i s assumed to depre ciate at  a 3 percent ann ual rate i n real ter ms, keeping t he
ratio of t he current ac count defic it to GDP about flat .  Lastly , the fi scal ass umptions
in the e xtensi on hold the  unifie d budget s urplus a t about 2 p ercent  of nominal  GDP,
modestly higher than the surplus in cal endar 2002.
(7) The baseline  strate gy in chart 4 i s designed t o hold core PCE infla tion
at 1¾  percen t, a tou ch bel ow th e rate a t the en d of th e Gre enbo ok ho rizon . 
Monetary policy is relati vely accommodative at the start of  the extension, with a rea l
federal funds rate  of about 2¼  percent, mor e than a percen tage point belo w its
equilibrium level implied by the baseline at that time.  Co nsequently, monetary policy
must tighten i n this sce nario, by r aising the  nominal funds rat e to 5½ percent by mid-
decade and  the real rate to abo ut its equilibrium  level of 3¾ pe rcent.  The pu rple ball-
and-chain line  in chart 4 show s a path for po licy that is sufficient to red uce inflation to

achiev e this o utcome, t he real  funds ra te needs  to ris e above i ts long- run equil ibrium
level to induce sla ck in the econo my.  In this exercise , the nomina l rate peaks at 6
percent by t he end of 2004,  enough to push the une mployment rate above  6 percent
and bring in flation down  to its target level by 20 06.  Policy, which  begins to ease in
2005 in anticipation of the completion of the d isinflation, would presumably ease
further a fter 200 6 to b ring the u nempl oyment  rate back  to th e NAIRU.
(8) The 2½ percentage point decline in the funds rat e so far this year
represent s the swift est monetary pol icy easi ng since the  autumn of 1984.  To pr ovide

  4.  More precisel y, the red dot ted line i s the outcome of a f ull-infor mation optimal cont rol
exercise.  The policymaker is ass umed to place equal weight on minimizing squared
deviations  of core PCE inflat ion from its t arget and unemployment  from the short -run
effective NAIRU and to follow a gradualist strat egy that penalizes quart er-to-quarter changes
in the funds r ate.  The penal ty was chosen t o approximate the g radual changes  in the funds
rate that have b een observ ed over the p ast fifteen years.

the funds rate in the first half of this year has been much closer to that of the perfect
foresight policy than to that of the Taylor rule.
(9) The staff forecast is arguably at odds with the market’s view, which
appears to i ncorporate ex pectations  of both a rapid r eversal of  the funds rat e and
stronger cor porate earni ngs.  Chart 6 c onsiders t he possibil ity that t he market’s  outlook
can be rationalized by faster growth of potential ou tput than projected by the staff.  In
these exercises , structural l abor productivity acceler ates ¾ percentage point to 3¼
percent beginning in 2001:Q3, abou t the same as estimated for 1999-2000.  As before,
the black s olid line pl ots the ext ended baseli ne, shown for r eference pur poses.  The
blue dashed li ne and the red dot ted line s how the funds rat es from the Tayl or rule and
the perfect foresight policy, respectively, operating in the context of the higher
structura l productivi ty growth.  Bot h rules ini tially  hold the fede ral funds ra te around
its current value in  response to n ear-term econ omic wea kness and ultim ately raise it
enough to be  consis tent wit h the hig her ret urns to c apital  provided  by fast er long- run
growth.5  However, because  the Taylor rul e does not res pond to the producti vity surge
until  it be comes man ifest in ou tput,  imbala nces i n infl ation  and out put ar ise.  By
contrast, the funds rate under the perfect foresight policy increases much m ore rapidly,

  6.  Indeed, a s imulation under  perfect for esight wit h less gra dualism than obse rved over the
past fifteen years produces a federal funds rate path that fairly closely matches the near-term
dip as well as the  subsequen t rebound b uilt into financial m arkets.beginning next  year in a pat tern simil ar to that s een in fina ncial fut ures markets,  and
fosters a smoo ther path for in flation and un employm ent.6   
(10) The reduction i n corporate ea rnings of l ate, shoul d it continue , might be
taken  as si gnali ng that  struc tural  labor  product ivity growt h will  conti nue to s low.  To
consider the implications of this possibility, we examine simulations in w hich
productivity growth steps down to 1¾ percent, about ¾ percentage point bel ow that
projected i n the Greenbook for t his year and ne xt.  Chart 7 pl ots the funds  rate in the
baseline c ase for re ference and,  with this new as sumption for produc tivity g rowth, the
funds rate paths produced by the T aylor rule (the blue dashed line) and the perfect
foresight  policy (t he red dotted l ine).  The pr oductivity  decelerat ion reduces c urrent
and expected  income an d leads to a m arked weake ning in aggre gate deman d relative to
the baseli ne, while addi ng to pressure s on costs t hat boost inf lation.   The effect s of the
downshift in de mand predominate for e ach of the pol icy rules , and so both ca ll for
sharp declines in  the funds rate in  early 2002.  Un like chart 6, where  the Taylor ru le
falls be hind emerging economic  developments,  here it does  considerabl y better.   The
main reason  for the Taylor r ule’s more ap pealing perfor mance is that th e productivity
decelerat ion in this  simulation e xacerbates  the economic sl uggishness c urrently i n train,
which  was al ready  prom pting  the ba ckwa rd-loo king T aylor r ule to p rescrib e easin g.

  7.  These individual estimates of the intermediate-run eq uilibrium real federal funds rate are
derived from the FRB/US model, fr om a statis tical f ilter s eparating pe rmanent and
temporary changes  in the rel ationship of  the real f unds rate t o the output ga p, and from
indexed debt yields.  One estima te from the FRB/ US mod el and one from the filter are
based on h istorical data, while a nother set takes ac count of the staff ’s forecast through  2002. Short-Run Policy Alternatives
(11) Incoming data have  prompted the sta ff to revi se down its outl ook for
investment s pending over the  next year and a  half, di rectly r estraini ng the expansi on of
economic activity.  This slower accumu lation of capital also pulls down the estimated
growth of stru ctural produ ctivity, and associated  reductions in e xpected return s to
labor and ca pital work to d amp furthe r the forecast of agg regate dema nd.  The effects
of thes e devel opments on c onsumption s pending ar e partl y offs et by gre ater s timulus
from tax cuts th an assumed  in the last Green book.  On  net, econom ic growth is
expected to be somewh at slower this year and the unemp loyment rate to rise more
sharply than in the last forecast.  Although lower pro ductivity growth implies more
intense inflation p ressures at any giv en unem ployment r ate, the econom y is sufficiently
weak in the forecast to put effective slack in labor markets by late this year.  This slack
and the  indir ect e ffects of lower o il prices cause  core c onsumer  inflation  to edge  down
in 2002 from the higher pace experienced t his year.  In the st aff’s ass essment, an
unchanged feder al funds rat e over the next  year and a hal f, as as sumed in the
Greenbook, is mod erately accommodative and  helps growth of aggregate dem and rise
a little abo ve that of po tential out put b y the second  half of next  year, halting the cl imb

  8.  The r ange of  estimates  for past ye ars has b een adju sted dow nward  to some  extent,
largely because  of modifica tions to the FR B/US  model.
  9.  The range indicated by the shaded area does not capt ure all the uncertai nties associat ed
with estimating the equilibrium real funds rate; in particular it does not include standard
errors ar ound the indivi dual esti mates.  For example,  the standar d error of t he current
estimated equilibri um real rate from the stati stical fil ter is around 1½ percentage points, even
before a ccoun ting for u ncertain ty in the staf f’s estimate  of poten tial outpu t.for the current equilibrium rate is roughly the sam e as that shown last time.8  The ½
percentage po int policy easing a t the May m eeting has pu t the estimated re al funds rate
noticeably  below that rang e.  This gap pr ovides a measur e of the st imulus from the
current stance of monetary policy , but one that depends on the many assumptions that
went into co nstructing the e stimates of the eq uilibrium fu nds rate, impo rtantly
including the  staff’ s estimate  of struct ural producti vity growth and t he level of  the
NAIRU.9  The real federal funds rates implied by the policy alternatives discussed
below for thi s meeting–cuts  of 25 and 50 basi s points as  well as an uncha nged funds
rate–are al so plotted.
(13) With m uch of the effect o n spending  of the 250 basis p oints of easing still
to be reali zed and the real  funds rate a lready see mingly below it s equilibr ium value, th e
Comm ittee may wish to keep the federal funds rate unchanged  at this meeting, as
assumed in  the Greenb ook.  In the staff ou tlook, with an u nchanged  federal funds rate
the effe ctive NAIRU rises al ong with the unemployment  rate over t he forecas t period,
and therefor e only a moderate  amount of slack  opens up in labor mar kets.  The
Comm ittee may see that slack as needed to lean against the recent updrift in a num ber
of measures of inflation, especially if it wishes to make further progress toward price
stability over time .  In the Green book forecast, th e growth o f real activity would
already be drawing close to that of  its potential and headed higher by t he time an
easing  at this m eeting  wou ld beg in to h ave a n oticea ble im pact o n the e cono my. 
12
  10.  Market react ions to the  surprise  elements in pol icy easing s have varied wide ly and
somewhat unpr edicta bly thi s year,  as shown in  the append ix on page 17 .Indeed, the C ommittee  may be con cerned that the  recent behavio r in financial m arkets
suggests that inv estors could rev ise up their inflation  expectations sh ould grow th
revive es pecially  rapidly.   In light of  the uncertai nties about t he response of  the
economy to the steep easing of po licy so far this year, a pause may be considered
appropriate a t present to assess b etter whether th e previous po licy actions are likely to
induce a suitable rebound in econ omic activity.
(14) A decision to hol d the funds rat e unchanged at t his meeting–e ven with a
statement ind icating that the C ommittee  still saw risks weigh ted toward  econom ic
weakness–would ta ke financi al market part icipants  by surprise .  The extent  of the
surprise woul d depend in part on t he data on durable  goods orders,  home sales,  and
consumer confide nce that wil l be recei ved just bef ore the FOMC meeting, but judgi ng
from current f utures market quot es, short -term rates  would back up sharpl y, like ly by
more than ¼ percentage  point, as  markets became unce rtain about whet her any
additional  easing would be f orthcoming this  year.  The re sulting upward pr essure on
long-term yields, though, would likely be offset somew hat by a decline in stock prices,
which could be shar p.10
(15) Instead, the Co mmittee m ay deem it ap propriate to ea se policy at this
meeting.  A ggregate dem and again h as proven w eaker than an ticipated and h as yet to
show con crete signs of firmin g, while declines in  resource utilizatio n are likely to
relieve p ressures  on prices.   In these ci rcumstances,  the Committee may view t he
staff’s assessment of the e conomic o utlook as reaso nably likely and  acceptable, but it
may see the ri sk to that f orecast as  uncomfortably wei ghted to the downsi de.  With the
economy already soft for three quarters, the extent and further d uration of the forces
acting to re strain spe nding stil l very uncle ar, and the de gree of the c ountervail ing
13
stimulus from the easier monetary and fi scal policies quit e uncertain, an additional
easing of policy by 25 basis po ints would provide greater assurance o f a satisfactory
strengthening  of econom ic activity.  Moreo ver, a rate cut sma ller than those ea rlier this
year would  be approp riate if the Com mittee saw p olicy as already reaso nably
accommodative and therefore wished to proceed more cautiously on the t hought that
the easing c ycle might nee d to be brought to a  close befo re long.  Bra king the pace  of
easing would li kely limit  the tendency  of market part icipants , observed a fter rec ent
policy actions, t o extrapolate further ea sing, which might otherwise lead to f inancial
cond itions  that th e Com mitte e view ed as ex cessive ly stim ulativ e. 
(16) With market participants putting a li ttle more than even odds on a 50
basis point move at this meeting,  short-term interest  rates would move up on an
announcement of a 25 ba sis point e asing, ev en if accompani ed by a stat ement that the
risks  were sti ll tilted t oward weakne ss.  Mark et part icipan ts are  unlikel y to rev ise up
significantly their forec ast of the low p oint for the targe t funds rate, but th ey probably
would push that po int further into the future, implying that intermediate- and longer-
term interest rates w ould only ed ge higher.  W ith the Federal R eserve still expected to
ease again, the neg ative reaction in sto ck markets co uld well be lim ited.  Howev er, if
the smaller size of the action and the words o f the announcement fostered the b elief
that the easing cyc le had com e to an end, a m ore prono unced reactio n in markets
would be likely.
(17) Alternativ ely, the  Committee may see aggr egate demand or inf lation
pressures as likely to be noticeably weaker than in the staff forecast, arguing for a more
forceful easing of 50 basis po ints.  The near-term prospects for corporate earnings are
bleak, ra ising the pos sibili ty of larg er decline s in equity  prices tha n are built i nto the
staff forecast.  The resu lting hit to hou sehold wealth , along with the  more rapid  rise in
unemployment, could sap consumption spending considerably.  Even if t he staff has
14
judged the funda mentals of sp ending correc tly, the Committee may view the  inflati on
outlook to be more favora ble than in the Greenboo k.  In particular, the Committee
may interpret the good inflation perform ance of the past few years as resulting more
from lasti ng changes in under lying labor  market conditi ons and less f rom the
temporary  effects of the acceleration  of productiv ity than is implicit in  the staff
forecast.  If so, the equilib rium real fun ds rate wou ld also be low er than is imp licit in
the Greenbook, and more forceful policy ease  could be seen as necessary t o achieve
the co rrect co nfigu ration  of the a ctual a nd eq uilibr ium r eal rate s. 
(18) If the Committee r educes the f unds rate 50 bas is points whi le retai ning a
statement of risks weighted toward econ omic weakness, short-term interest rates
woul d likely fall, especially as mark ets build in f urther e asing th is year and d efer some
of the polic y tighteni ng now expected for  2002.  Equity mar kets would be buoye d by
the move, but the rally could prove tr ansitory if subsequent ea rnings reports prove
disappointing as is likely under the staff forecast.  Real bond yields would likely fall as a
consequence of the policy action, and–un less the initial equity market rally were
particularly vigo rous–nom inal yields could  decline som e as well.  Any in crease in
inflatio n expe ctation s wou ld be sh ort-liv ed if, co nsisten t with  the C omm ittee’s
rationale  for its a ction, t he markets subs equently re ceive evi dence of pers isting
weakness in e conomic activi ty and damped infl ation.
(19) Borrowing by nonfeder al sector s is expec ted to moderate s lightly i n the
second half of  the year,  in line wit h the slowing i n nominal income growth unde r the
Greenbo ok forecast.  Cred it supply cond itions for busine sses are likely to contin ue to
tighten in coming mo nths amid signs of further deterioration in the qua lity of weaker
borrowers and unfa vorable news on co rporate ear nings.  Never theless,  with the
econom y strengthenin g later this year and  in 2002, a wides pread contra ction in credit
availability is not forese en under th e staff forecast.  Businesse s are anticipated to
15
maintain a moderat e pace of borro wing, despit e softnes s in capit al expendit ures and a
reduced rate  of equity re tirements,  as sluggis h cash flow prompts  firms to rel y more on
external funds.  Household deb t growth is forecast to drift down, reflecting a slower
pace of spendi ng on consumer durables  and the paydown of some c redit card debt
with a portion of the tax rebates.  In the mon ths just ahead, the Treasury is projected
to become a net borr ower to financ e tax rebat es, but the n to resume paying  down debt
over the final months of the year .  Mainly reflecti ng this pattern, growth of tot al
domestic nonfi nancial debt  is foreca st to pick up s ome in the next f ew months and
then to mo ve down o ver the rest of the yea r, bringing gro wth for the yea r to 5 percent.
(20) With the w aning of the effects o f previous po licy easings on op portunity
cost and money demand,  M2 is projecte d to slow to a 5½ perce nt growth rate o ver the
June-to-December period u nder the staff forecast.  Whi le tax rebates should boo st M2
holdings somewhat i n the months ahead,  a reduced lev el of mortgage  refinanci ngs
likely will restrain growth of this aggregate.  Given the Greenbo ok forecast of only a
small decli ne in equity pr ices, t he projecti on does not incor porate a rene wal of inves tor
shifts from the stock market t o M2 assets.  M2 is expected to post growth of 8¼
percent this year, im plying a 4¼  percent decline  in its velocity.  The ex pansion of M 3 is
projected to slo w to a 7½  percent pace o ver the June-to -Decemb er period, as gro wth
of insti tution al mo ney fu nds slo ws wi th the s tabiliz ing of  short- term i nteres t rates. 
Over the fo ur quarters o f the year, M3 w ould expan d 11 percent.

Appendix
The reaction of financial  markets to changes in monetary policy thi s year has
varied consi derably and prov ed diffic ult to predi ct.  The tabl e below indica tes how
stock prices and Treasury coupon  yields have responded to the five easings undertaken
earlier in the year.  The first column shows the “surprise” com ponent of each
adjustment in the target funds rate, which is inferred from th e change in a near-term
federal f unds futures c ontract around t he time of a pol icy announcement.   In the
afternoons following the first three easings this year, equity prices responded rather
strongly to the su rprise in policy actio ns, probably b ecause investors w ere quite
uncertain and c oncerned about t he near-te rm outlook for the  economy, and the
“surprise”  affecte d confidence a s well as t he outlook for i nterest r ates.  The
consequen ces for the econo my and for  future policy o f the shift in attitudes an d equity
mark et reactions appea red t o cau se nomina l Tre asury yields to move i n the  same
direction as stock  prices, rather than in  the direction o f the policy surpr ises.  In April,
however, with investors already becom ing more optimistic about the eco nomic future,
a traditional response of market interest rates occurred following the u nexpected policy
easing–the e quity price  rise was more moderat e relati ve to the degr ee of surpri se and
yields fell.  In the wake  of the easing at th e May FO MC m eeting, which w as a little
greater than the average of  market expectations, s hort-term Treasury yields dropped,  as
would trad itiona lly be e xpected , but st ock pric es and lo ng-ter m yields  were about
unchanged.
