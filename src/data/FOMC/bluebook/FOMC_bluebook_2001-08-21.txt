The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from  the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserv e System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensiv e digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES
Recent D evelopm ents
(1) Market exp ectations for the p ath of the federal fu nds rate mo ved up in
late June as  investors  apparently  read the Committee’ s choice of  a 25 basis poi nt
easing at the June meeting and the May minutes releas ed the next day as evidence that
the Com mittee migh t ease in the future b y less than previo usly though t.1  This st ep-up
was short-lived , though, as m arket participants  began to m ark down  the expected p ath
for policy  in light of  predominantly di sappointing ne ws on economic acti vity and
corporate ea rnings and gener ally benig n inflati on reports.   Policy expec tations
declined cons iderably f ollowing the Chai rman’s monetary p olicy tes timony in mid-
July–which was s een as emphasizi ng downside risk s for the ec onomy in general a nd
capital spending in particular–and the anecdo tal reports in the August
Beigebook–wh ich were viewed as signs that econom ic weakness was becoming  more
widespread.   Concerns about the  deteriora ting economic out look in Europe and
Japan, along with the continuing w oes of Argentina and som e other emerging market
coun tries, ad ded to  the sen se of un certain ty and  pessim ism in  globa l finan cial m arkets . 
Futures market quotes sugg est that investors are confident that the FOM C will ease
by at least ¼ p ercentage poin t at this meeting (c hart 1).  Futures p rices imply a pa th
for the funds ra te that trough s at about 3¼  percent early nex t year–abou t ¼

path for the fun ds rate.  
  3.  The yield on t he on-the-run t en-year note f ell consi derably more than t hat on the
compara ble off-the-run  security over the  period as the n ewly auction ed note, as usu al,
garnered a si zable premium; othe r on-the-run Tr easury coupon yie lds decli ned about in li ne
with comparable off-the-run yields.   Treasury bill yiel ds fell over the period, but  by less than
other money market yi elds, in pa rt as the  ramping up of weekly bi ll aucti on sizes and t he
additional  supply from the i ntroducti on of the weekly four -week bill put  pressure on t he
financing market  at times and e vidently s trained i nvestors’  willingnes s to accumulat e more of

of three-mo nth comm ercial paper an d eurodo llar rates over the thre e-month b ill yield
touched historic lows of only a few basis  points in late Jul y.
  4.  The drop in imp lied inflation compensation may  have been am plified by upward
pressures  on indexed yiel ds surrounding  the auction of  new ten-year i ndexed notes in mid-
July, as investors m ay have req uired larger prem iums to abso rb these securities into  their

(2) The souring mood regardi ng the economic outl ook and the atte ndant
change in expectations for monetary p olicy were associated with widespread declines
in longe r-term yields  over the  period a nd a sell off in e quity mark ets.  Off-the -run
nominal Treasury coup on yields fell 20 to 30 basis points, with shorter maturities
registering the steepest declines.3  By contrast, yields on longer-term Treasury
inflati on-indexed se curities  were litt le changed,  implying that  the infla tion
compensation in nom inal securities fell about 25 basis points.4  Despite the more
pessimist ic economic outl ook, inves tment- and most spe culative -grade priv ate yiel ds
declined about in line with com parable off-the-run Treasury yields, leaving risk
spreads li ttle change d on balance.   As an exception t o this gener al patter n, yields  on
junk b onds  in the t elecom  sector  rose fu rther t o wid en alre ady he fty spre ads. 
Through early August, stock prices la rgely proved resili ent to a spate of negative
earnings announc ements and resul ting cuts i n analysts ’ earnings  projectio ns for the
remainder of t his year.   But equity pri ces have sl umped since then i n response to t he
3
accumulation of adverse news on the economy and earnings; broad indexes  have
fallen 2¾ to 6½ perc ent over the pe riod, with e speciall y disappoint ing reports  on
profit s for hi gh-tec h firms we ighing on  the Nasdaq .
(3) The index of the dollar’s trade-weighted exchang e value against other
major currenci es decline d 2½ percent over t he period, wi th much of this c hange
occurring in r ecent days.   While investor s marked down their e xpectati ons of
economic growth  around the world an d interest rates and equity prices fell in most
industrial countries, the downward revision to th e expected path of policy rates
seemed greate st in the Unit ed States.   In addition,  public debate  about the merit s of
the “strong-dollar” policy intensified over the intermeeting period, and m arket
concerns about the sustainability of the U.S. current accoun t deficit were heightened
by the  publi cation  this w eek of t he IM F Ar ticle IV  review  of the U .S. econ omy.  O n
balance si nce the June meet ing, the dol lar has fa llen 6 perc ent against  the euro and 3
percent agai nst the yen de spite fur ther discour aging news about t he economies of
Europe and Japan .  On Augu st 14, the Bank of Japan surprised man y market
participants by announcing an increas e in its provision of l iquidity to the financi al
system.  The dol lar gained 1  percent on bal ance against  the Canadian doll ar; the Bank
of Canada cut it s policy ra te 25 basis  points in mid- July, ci ting spil lover eff ects from
slower growth in  the U.S. ec onomy.  Over the inte rmeeting peri od,                         
                                                                                                                                    
U.S. monetary authorities did not intervene.
(4) The dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies of our o ther
important tr ading partn ers.  Concern s about the A rgentine gov ernment’s ab ility to
resolve its budg et problem s were not allaye d by the ann ouncem ent of a fiscal austerity
plan requiring budgetary balance o n a month-to-mo nth basis.  The runoff of private-
sector depos its from the  banking syst em was very ste ep, and sprea ds of Argentine
debt over comparabl e Treasurie s remained high a nd volatil e.  Spill overs from the
turmoil in Argentina add ed to problems in Brazil, which reso rted to monetary policy
4
tightening and foreign exchange intervention  to blunt pressure on the real.  Despite
the announcement in early Aug ust that Brazil would obtain a n ew $ 15 billion IMF
program, the real has depreci ated 7½ percent a gainst the  dollar on net o ver the
intermeeting  period.  Me xican financial m arkets were large ly unaffected by th e turmoil
elsewhere in Latin America, and the p eso held steady even as the central bank eased
policy .  In emer ging Asia , the on going wors ening of  global h igh-te ch market s put
downward p ressure on exchange rates and equity prices in several coun tries.
(5) In the United States, overall private borrowing ap pears to have slowed
from the brisk  pace regis tered in the  spring (char t 2).  In r ecent months,  issuance of
corporate bonds has drop ped well below its earlier torrid rate, while commercial pap er
and busines s loans at bank s have continu ed to contract.  A ccording to r espondents to
the August Senior Loa n Officer Surve y, almost a ll of whom repres ent large ba nks, the
recent decline in busines s loans owed importantly to a weakening in demand that has
stemmed, in part, from firms scaling back their capital spend ing.  These banks also
reported a f urther tig htening of t erms and standar ds on business  loans, al though the
fraction do ing so was down from pri or surveys.   In the househol d sector,  mortgage
debt growth has slowed  only a little, but the expansion of consumer credit has fallen
off appreci ably.  By cont rast, f ederal debt  growth has turned up i n the last c ouple of
months–albeit probably only temporarily–ref lecting both weaker-than-expe cted tax
receipts and borrowing to finance the tax reb ates.
(6) M2 growth remained strong  in July, a t about 8½ percent , but was bel ow
the average pace over the fi rst half of this  year.  The expansion over the fi rst half was
supported by declining opportunity costs associated with policy easing, but M2
grow th wa s faster t han w ould h ave be en exp ected b ased o n histo rical re lation ships. 
Indeed, M2 veloci ty fell  at a 6¾ percent r ate, the  most rapid half -year decl ine since t he
early 1980s .  A portion of t his unusual s trength li kely owes to a  surge in mortgage
refinanci ng spurred by decl ining long-t erm interest  rates la te last y ear and also t o the
increase in stock market volatility and steep declines in equity prices earlier this year,

The Expected Path of the Federal Funds Rate and Investor Uncertainty
The staff often pr esents measures o f the expected path of t he federal funds rat e derived
from federal funds  and eurodollar futu res, as in the panel bel ow.  This path is con structed
by subtracting estimates of term premiums from futures quotes and, in the case of
eurodollar futures, the premium of the spot three-month LIBOR rate (the settlement rate
for the eurodollar futures contract) over the target federal funds rate.  Estimates of term
premiums are based on historical differences between futures rates and subsequent spot
rates.  The reliance o n such estimates nec essarily implies s ome imprecision in t he calculated
expected funds rate  path.  But the estimat ed expected funds ra te path has nonethe less
seemed to provide a reasonable measure of market participants’ mean expectation of
possible future f ederal funds rates .  
In addition to a mean exp ectation of future f ederal funds rates , investors also h ave views
about the variance  of possible future federal funds rates.  A measure of this type of
uncertainty–invest ors’ perceptions  of the likely range of p otential outcomes f or the federal
funds rate–can be obt ained from the prices  of options on euro dollar futures us ing a
standard option-p ricing formula.  Such  estimates indicate t hat investors beli eve there is a 90
percent probability that realized funds rates over the next twelve months will fall in the
shaded area.  Thus, although the expected funds rate path indicates that investors are
forecasting some m odest further eas ing into early next year f ollowed by substant ial
tightening, the 2¼ percentage point width of the shaded area twelve months from now
suggests that the y believe it quite poss ible that the actual fun ds rate a year from no w could
turn out to be considerably higher or lower than their current mean expectation of almost 4
percent.

Bank pre sidents reported in  July.  Policy Alternatives
(7) Benchm ark revisions to th e National In come and  Product A ccount data
and reports of a bleaker outlook for fixed investm ent in the near term have prom pted
the sta ff to red uce fu rther i ts estim ate of p rospe ctive g rowth  in pot ential o utpu t. 
Given the associated scal ing down of future returns to labor and capital , as well as
weaker-than- expected spe nding data here  and abroad, the  Greenbook project ion of
the growth  of aggregate d emand h as been lowe red about as m uch as that of ag gregate
supply.  As a result, the forecasts of the output gap and inflation do n ot differ much
from those p repared for the  June meetin g.  As before, the sta ff believes that a variety
of forces–including the expected com pletion of the inventory correction, further
declines i n energy pric es, the f iscal st imulus provided by  the tax cut,  and the
cumulative monetary policy easing–will  support a revival of economic growth at
around p revailing financial m arket condition s.  In the baseline pr ojection, the staff
assumes that the federal funds rate will be maintained at 3¾  percent over the forecast
period, with eq uity prices and th e foreign excha nge value of th e dollar projecte d to
edge off only a litt le and longer-term yields moving up a tad.   Against this financial
backdrop, re al GDP is antici pated to advanc e at a rate  of 1¼ percent in t he second
half of  this ye ar and of 2 ¾ percent o ver the  four quar ters of  next yea r.  Output
growth over 2002 a bout matches the  downward-revise d estimate of  growth of the
economy’s potential output and  keeps the unemploym ent rate around the level
consistent with no change in inflation pressures.  The resulting slack in resource
utilization help s to hold core  PCE in flation to 1¾  percent next year,  a touch below
the r ate p rojected for 2 001.  Given  the p rojected drop i n ener gy pr ices, ove rall PCE
inflation is expec ted to decline from 2 percent thi s year to 1¾ percent in 2002.5
(8) Should the Com mittee find the staff’s explication of the forces
9
promoting a rebound in e conomic growth and shapi ng the infl ation outlook  to be
convincing, it may opt to keep the fund s rate unchanged .  After all, cumulative policy
easing  this ye ar has put  the rea l funds r ate well  below est imates o f its equili brium valu e
(see box on page 13), and this policy stance presum ably will, after some further delay,
foster a r easonable re vival in t he growth of spendi ng over time.   In that rega rd, the
rapid growth of M2 and othe r measures of hous ehold liquidi ty so far t his year might
be taken as a ten tative indication th at financial cond itions are well po sitioned to
support such a rebound.  In these circumstance s, the Committee may believe that
further policy stim ulus wou ld carry too gre at a risk of an over shooting of ag gregate
demand  that would  lead to added  pressures on in flation and a de terioration in
inflation expectations that may prove stubborn  to unwind.  Indeed, the Co mmittee
may be of the vie w that the sl ow recovery of a ggregate demand i n the Greenbook
forecast , and the as sociated e asing of pre ssures in l abor markets,  is both neces sary and
desirable  so as to provi de better as surance that  core infl ation will  be capped going
forward, as it is in the  staff forecast.
(9) The choice of an unchanged federal funds rate t arget would come as a  
surprise t o financial  markets that  would be litt le tempered by a n announcement of
continued d ownside risks.  S hort-term inte rest rates would  back up by a  considerable
amount and eq uity prices likely would decline, as the tighter-than-expected monetary
policy stance more than offsets the perception that the Federal R eserve sees a stronger
econom y than previou sly thought b y market par ticipants.  The po licy surprise wo uld
tend to raise bo nd yields by pu shing expected  funds rates high er.  The likely decline  in
equity pric es, however,  would lead inves tors to anti cipate more re straint on
consumption via the w ealth effect, perhaps limiting the extent to which the expected
path of the funds rates is ratcheted up and, accordingly, the pickup in lon ger-term
yields.
(10) The Com mittee may c onsider the G reenbook fo recast to be both
10
plausible  and acceptabl e, even wit h the project ed delay in t he resumption of
satisfactory output growth, but still choose to reduce the federal funds rate 25 basis
points .  In particular, the string of bad news on the econom y may heighten the sense
that there  are sizabl e odds on especi ally adver se outcomes for  aggregate de mand,
particularly for capital spending.  The Com mittee may be of the view that such
downside risks  to the real  side could be c ountered by a sl ight furthe r easing in  the
present situation  with little ill effect, as inflation rece ntly has been b enign and is like ly
to remain contained.  Given the scop e for downside developm ents, the Committee
may be especially averse to surprising markets, in that an unchan ged policy stance
could risk tighte ning financial co nditions app reciably should  market particip ants begin
to question Federal Reserve intentions.  Alternatively, the Com mittee may consider
the staf f’s outl ook, especi ally the s peed and the ext ent of the pr ojected ri se in the
unemploym ent rate, to be unacceptable and to warrant ano ther slight further policy
easing as a countervailing move.
(11) The selection o f a 25 basis point r eduction in th e funds rate, presu mably
accompan ied by an assessm ent that the risks are  still weighted tow ard econom ic
weakness, wo uld be alm ost as accom modative a s the average exp ectation built into
financial markets.  Accordingly, bond yields likely would ed ge higher, while stock
prices may come under some downward pressure.  The recent downdraft of the dollar
on foreign cur rency markets  makes it more dif ficult t o predict the  probable cours e of
exchange rates.  While textbooks teach that po licy ease that falls short of market
expecta tions s hould lea d to an appr eciat ion of t he curre ncy, t he recen t market  focus
on re lative spendin g pro spects sugg ests that the do llar mig ht come un der s ome
downwar d pres sure.  
(12) Choice of a 50 basis po int easing action might follow from  the concern
that m ore eco nom ic wea kness c ould w ell be in  train th an pro jected  in the G reenb ook. 
Althoug h consum ption has held  up remark ably well so far, an a brupt softenin g in
11
consumer spending i s not implausi ble given th e prospect of  a sharp ris e in the
unemployment rate a nd already re lativel y high debt burdens .  Moreover, f oreign
economic acti vity could wel l disappoint  for a varie ty of reas ons, incl uding deepening
crises i n certain e merging market ec onomies or additi onal slowing i n the pace of
activit y in some major indus trial ec onomies.  Such eve ntualiti es would tend to pr olong
both the inve ntory liquidatio n and the d ecline in capital spen ding, which w ould
translat e into a decl ine in the e quilibrium rea l funds rat e.  Although the l evel of the
real funds r ate implied by  the 3¼ percent nominal  funds rate of  this alt ernative a nd
prevailing inflation  expectations w ould be app reciably below  that which is su stainable
in the long ru n, a rapid policy r eversal along th e lines of that curre ntly embed ded in
futures market prices could be underta ken once information finally s tarts to signal
convincingl y that more sol id economic growth has  taken hold.
(13) The choice of a  50 basis poi nt easing,  combined with a st atement
continuing to point to downside risks,  would be more forceful than markets have
priced in for this m eeting, though  futures mark et participants seem  to expect that a
cumulative easing of this magnitude w ill be put in place by early next year.  If
investors com e to believe that th e Comm ittee is more con cerned abou t econom ic
softening t han previousl y thought as a r esult of t he surprise  component of the ac tion,
they would  both mo ve the anticipated  easing forwar d in time and  augmen t its
cumulative e xtent.  As an im mediate con sequence, shor t-term interest rates w ould
move down.  The unexpecte d size of the  policy eas e would probably prompt a  decline
in bond yield s and the foreign  exchange va lue of the dollar a nd some in crease in
equity values, although the magnitud e of these changes would imp ortantly be shaped
by the  word ing of  the sta temen t anno uncin g the a ction.  
(14) Under the Greenbook ass umption of no change i n the federa l funds
rate, t he staff  projects t hat the growth of  M2 from July to December would s low to a
5¼ pe rcent rate, mainly reflecting the widening of the opportunity cost of holding M2
12
as deposit r ates adjus t further t o prior easi ng actions.   Other contributor s to the
slowing in M2 growth inc lude the li kely waning of  mortgage refi nancing acti vity and a
leveling out of stock prices.  M2 would still be grow ing faster than nominal GD P over
the sec ond a nd thi rd qu arters, b ut the  contr action  in velo city wo uld be  slowi ng.  
Howev er, the staff considers th is money pr ojection to be su bject to conside rable
uncertainty because several unusual influences will be boo sting observed money
growth to an exte nt that is  difficul t to asses s.  These s pecial f actors inc lude
households’  placement of t ax rebate che cks in li quid deposits  and elevate d demands
for U.S. currency in Argentina ow ing to that country’s financial crisis and in the euro
area ahead of the conversion to euro cash  at the start of next year.
(15) The staff anticipate s that growth  of domestic n onfinancial deb t will
move lower to a 3½  percent rate over the last six months of the year.  A renew ed
paydown  of federal debt in  the fourth qu arter is expected to  offset the rise this
quarter, leaving fed eral debt outstan ding abou t unchange d on net ov er the second h alf
of the year .  The growth of t he debt of nonfe deral sect ors is for eseen to decl ine to a
4¼ percen t rate from Jun e to Decem ber.  For hou seholds, mor tgage borro wing is
expected to be  maintained at  around its se cond-quarter  pace, base d on the
continuation  of low mo rtgage interest rates, a p redilection for extr acting equity in
refinancings, and s till-solid hous ing a ctivity.  Co nsume r credit growth , though , seems
poised to downshift further from th e second quarter pace, in line with projected
weak ness in  nom inal ou tlays o n con sume r dura bles ov er the s econd  half of  the yea r. 
Businesses hav e already mad e considerable s trides in restructu ring their balan ce sheets
in response to lower longer-term yields and  the favorable issuance climate of the first

One way to assess the stance of monetary polic y is by comparing the actual real
federal funds rate t o estimates of its e quilibrium level.  The equili brium real federal
funds rate can be thought of as the rat e consistent with output being at i ts potential
level once the effects o f transitory shock s–those with  dynamics th at play out w ithin
a few y ears–h ave dis sipate d.   
Board staff con structs various estim ates of the equilib rium real fede ral funds rate
using three di fferent  frameworks: t he FRB/US model, a stati stical f ilter bas ed on
the relat ionship betwee n the real f ederal funds  rate and the out put gap, and yi elds
on ind exed  Trea sury debt  (whi ch ar e ava ilable o nly s ince 1998 ).  Th e FRB/US
model and the statistical filter are each used to derive two estimates, the first based
on historic al data only  and the
second on h istorical data
augmen ted by the staff
proje ction.  
The chart that  follows shows t he
range of these estim ates, as well
as the act ual real f ederal funds
rate and the real funds rates
implied by the policy alternatives
discussed in the text.   (The real
funds rates  are measured as  the
nominal federal funds rate less
the lagged fou r-quarter chan ge in
core PCE prices as  a proxy for
expected inflation.)  Over the past
year or so,  the range of t he
estimates  of the equil ibrium funds
rate has fallen by ab out half a
percentage poi nt.  For the
equilibri um rates based on t he
FRB/U S mode l, we can identify
the sources  of the decl ine.  The
table at the right p arses the chang e in the FRB /US estim ate using the histo rical data

Estimates o f the Equil ibrium Real Fede ral Funds Rate  (continue d)
Benchmark revisions to the NIPA data published over the intermeeti ng period, as
well as othe r incoming data,  caused the s taff to r evise down it s assess ments of
aggregate demand and  potential output, both in the past and going  forward.  These
changes had mostly offsetti ng effects on the est imates of the equilibri um real
federa l fund s rate.  In  the cas e of the  FRB /US meas ures, a r educt ion in  the sta ff’s
estimates  of struct ural growth in GDP in rec ent years a nd in the fore cast cause d a
decrease in estimates  of the equilibrium funds rate.   However, this effect was
countered by l ower estimate s of the equi ty premium–which reconc ile the l evel of
equity pric es in rece nt years wit h more modest gains i n earnings.   As shown in the
bottom-left  panel of the  chart, t he net changes  over the int ermeeting per iod in the
FRB/US estimates of t he equilibr ium funds rate ( based on the his torical da ta and
the staff projection) are relatively small.  Adjustments to the statistical-filter-based
estim ates of t he equ ilibriu m fun ds rate  were a lso m odest  (the bo ttom -right  panel ). 
While the sta ff trimmed its estim ates of potential o utput, it marke d down a ggregate
demand by a similar  amount, with only  a modest impact on t he estimate s of the
outp ut gap  that u nderl ie these  estim ates of t he equ ilibriu m rate .  
The revision s to the vari ous equilibr ium funds rate meas ures over the  intermeeti ng
period are qui te small compare d to the subst antial unce rtainty a ssociate d with the
estimates.  In the case of the statistical filter method, for example, formal standard
errors of the estimates can be calculated for each observation.  These standard
errors indi cate that  a 90 percent c onfidence i nterval ar ound the esti mates of the
equilibri um funds rate rang es from 1½ to 2½ percenta ge points on ea ch side of t he
point  estim ates.
