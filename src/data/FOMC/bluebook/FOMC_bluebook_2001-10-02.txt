 
Prefatory Note  
 
 
The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from  the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserv e System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensiv e digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a re daction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redact ed passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    
 
                                                
 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and we re not checked or corrected by staff.

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES
Recent D evelopm ents
(1) The events in financial markets prior to the terrorist attacks might seem
to read lik e ancient hi story by now:  The  Committee’s quart er-point r eduction in t he
intended fede ral funds rate on  August 2 1 was widely  expected and  barely sent a ripp le
through m arkets.  In the days th at followed, m ost market inte rest rates edged lo wer in
light of generally downbeat news on  the economy, including the release of the A ugust
empl oyme nt dat a in ear ly Sep temb er, and  broad  equit y inde xes fell a pprec iably. 
Shortly aft er the ter rorist at tacks on Septe mber 11, the Sys tem announced that t he
discount window was available to meet liquidit y needs and began to provide a massive
amount of reserves through  the window later that day and  through open m arket
operations on t he next day.   (See the box f or a discuss ion of Desk opera tions and
reserve mark ets in the afterma th of the attacks.)  M arket participants  evidently
interpreted the interruptions to production an d spending ensuing from  the terrorist
attacks and the possible  knock-on effects on asse t prices and confidence as
necessitating a considerable monetary policy response.  In the event, on S eptember
17, the FOMC reduced the ta rget feder al funds rat e ½ percentage poi nt to 3 percent
and said  in the pr ess re lease  that unus ually l arge vol umes of li quidity  would conti nue
to be supplie d until more normal f inancial mark et functi oning was rest ored.  In rec ent
days, inv estors appe ar to be inte rpreting t he sketchy i nformation avai lable on
economic conditi ons since Sept ember 11 as point ing to a gloomier  outlook for t he
economy, and federal funds futures qu otes seem to incorporate high od ds of another
50 basis point move at the October meeting and further eas ing in coming months that
would bring the funds rate to the neighborhood of 2 to 2¼ percent by earl y next year
(Chart 2).  As has been the case for som e time, market participants apparently expect
- 2 -
that polic y will reve rse course f airly promptl y, with about  1 percentage  point of
firming next y ear embed ded in ma rket interest rates, althou gh option p rices indicate
that in vestor s are un usual ly unc ertain  abou t this tr ajecto ry. 
Desk Operat ions and Re serve  Markets i n the Wake of  the Sep t. 11 Attacks  
The operations  of some banks and federa l funds brokers  were serious ly disrupt ed by the
effects  of the ter rorist  attacks.   To help deal with t hese disloc ations t o markets and
payment systems, the System provided an immense volume of reserves through open
marke t operatio ns and d iscount w indow  lending  and also  establishe d swap  lines with
several for eign centr al banks, one of  which was partia lly drawn down (as s hown in the
table in Cha rt 1).  A large add itional volum e of reserves w as created by ch eck float as air
transport ation was halt ed.  Although ot her factors –notably a si gnificant  expansion in t he
foreign RP pool–absorbed a portion of these reserves,  reserve balances swelled
dramatically, p eaking at $11 4 billion on S eptember 1 3.  The System suspended i ts fees a nd
penalt ies for  daylig ht and over night ove rdraft s for a t ime to eas e the cha llenge s banks
faced in managing reserve positions.   To facilitate s ettlement in the Treasury s ecurities
market, the Desk temporarily eased it s rules on securiti es lending, and dealers borrowed
record amounts of s ecuriti es from the Syst em.  Late in the wee k, discount wi ndow
borrowing plunged,  returning  to more normal level s as a resul t of the enl arged volume of
nonborrowed reserve s and better  functioning  of the rese rve market.  As ai r transpor tation
resumed, th e level of float dro pped bac k to more u sual levels by ea rly the followin g week. 
With th e fed fun ds mar ket functioning more norm ally, the Desk gradually cut back
the provision of reserve s through open market operations, and the leve l of reserve
balances beg an to drop sharpl y.  Nonethele ss, the de mand for and supply of
reserve balances has remained som ewhat above usual levels.
In the immedi ate afterma th of the attacks, banks most ly traded reserves at the 3½ 
percent target federa l funds rate under an informal convention,  with a substantial
proportion of direct, ra ther than brokered, transac tions.  As more normal
functioning  resumed in the f unds market, t he federal  funds rate f ell below the
FOM C’s formal targets for several days but fluctuated around the n ew target last
week (as seen in  the lower pa nel of Chart 1 ).

(2) Rates on short- and intermediate-t erm Treasury securities f ell about 60
to 110 basis  points on bala nce over the i ntermeeting pe riod, with t he bulk of the
decline occurring afte r September 11.  The prices for thes e securities appear  to have
been boosted by actual and expected easi ng of the stance of monetary policy a s well as
safe-hav en demands amid sharp f luctuatio ns in equity  prices and  heightened global
economic and po litical uncertainties.  Yields on ten-year Treasury notes declined
about 30 ba sis points, howe ver, and those o n thirty-year bon ds were flat, buo yed in
part by inves tor concerns about the deteriorating outloo k for the federal budget
surplus and  the future sup ply of Treasur y debt.
(3) Some of the infrastructure of t he Treasury securities  market was
damaged or destroyed by the terrorist a ctions.  Since then,  market functioning has
improved consider ably but remains  somewhat impaired.   Virtually a ll brokers  and
dealers hav e resumed operat ions, al though many are opera ting at back up locations
and a number of fir ms have scale d back their mark et-making.   Trading volumes f or
on-the-run issues have ret urned to historical ranges , and bid-asked spreads have
narrowed.  Nonetheless, such spreads  remain slightly eleva ted, the amounts that can
be transacted at those spreads are smaller than usual, and trading  in off-the-run issues
is quite limited.  W hile clearance and  settlement m echanisms ar e now gen erally
performing norm ally, market participants report that a considerable volume of trades
from September 11  have yet to be reconciled.  Partly as a consequence, the incidence
of faile d securiti es trades  remains rela tively hi gh.
(4) Yields o n invest ment-gra de corpor ate bonds  were gene rally about
unchanged on balance  over the int ermeeting per iod, with t he exception o f those on
relatively short-term  or very highly r ated obligation s, such as federal agen cy debt,
which dro pped consid erably.  Junk bo nd yields, how ever, jumped  more than  100 basis
points over the period.  Issuance of corporate bon ds ceased for a few days after
- 4 -
September 11, and investm ent-grade firms have accounted for virtually all the issuance
since then .  Trading activity in secondary markets for corpo rate bonds also has picked
up in recent d ays but rema ins noticeably b elow norm al, particularly in the h igh-yield
sector.  The commercial paper m arket was significantly disrupted, leading to brief
involuntary  extensions  of paper that  would otherwise ha ve matured, but  issuance a nd
activit y have since  rebounded; duri ng the inter ruption, s ome firms report edly drew on
backup lines of credit at  commercial banks.  Discussions with seve ral large banks
indicate t hat most have not y et adjuste d their ter ms and standards f or business l oans
since Septe mber 11, but loa n requests f rom firms in sel ected indust ries are be ing
scrutinized more carefully ; some of the banks contacted sai d that loan demand had
weak ened n otably .  Equ ity ma rkets w ere clo sed for  four d ays foll owin g the a ttacks. 
After the markets reopened, broad  equity price indexes tumbled, but in recent days
they have recovered part of those losses on balance, bringing their cu mulative declines
over the interm eeting period to  13 to 22 percen t.  Intraday price ch anges in the eq uity
market were quit e large,  and forward-l ooking measures of  uncertaint y inferre d from
options pric es are unusual ly high.
(5) The dollar’s average exchange va lue against other major currencie s was
about unchanged on balance over the intermeeting period,  as modest dollar
appreciation ea rly in the period  was erased follo wing the attack s.  The dollar var ied in
a wide range agai nst the yen,  ending the peri od ¾ percent lower.   Against the eur o,
the doll ar sli pped ½ percen t on bala nce.  I n contras t, the  dollar  gained a bout
2 perc ent vi s-à-vis the Canad ian dol lar, as inv estor s rea cted t o sign s that  the sl owdown
in that country could be particul arly abrupt.  Central banks i n most foreign industrial
countri es appre ciably  eased pol icy af ter the  attack s, typicall y by 50 bas is point s, but
long-term yi elds genera lly moved lit tle on net.   Share prices  fell sha rply on all  major
exchanges,  in many cases by  more than in this  country.                                                   ,

own accounts.
(6) The dollar’ s exchange val ue against t he currencie s of our other i mportant
trading part ners rose 2 pe rcent during t he intermeet ing period,  driven espec ially by t he
reaction in Latin  America n markets to  the more u ncertain globa l economic
environment.  The  dollar gai ned 7¼ percent agai nst the Brazi lian real, and it rose 4¾
percent  against  the peso , as Mexi can output  declin ed and as i nvestor s worrie d about
an intensi ficati on of the spil lovers fr om the U.S. slowdown.   Trading in emergi ng
market debt was s everely r educed for al most a week.  Once tr ading recover ed,
emerging market bond spreads increased sharply,  with those on Latin American
sovereign de bt widening by 50 t o 200 basis poi nts on net over  the intermee ting
perio d.  
(7) M2 growth sp iked to an estimated 19 percent annu al rate in September
as the res ult of a rec ord $165 bill ion surge in t his aggregat e for the week  ending
September 17.  In that week, disruptions to the infrastructure o f financial markets led
to a large involuntary accumulati on of liquid deposits, which is  expected to have
largely run off in th e subsequen t week.  A heig htened dem and for safe and  liquid
assets apparently e ncouraged  further substitu tions from eq uity mutua l funds into
deposits i n M2.  The flight  to safet y and the inte rmeeting poli cy easing s purred a
resurgence in institution-only mo ney mar ket funds in September, further lifting M3
growth.  D omestic non financial sector deb t expanded a t a 4¾ percen t pace in Au gust,
about in line w ith its average gro wth since the fo urth quarter  of last year.  The gro wth
of nonfedera l debt remain ed relatively low, as th e liquidation o f inventories likely

Policy Alternatives
(8) The inform ation that had  accumula ted up to Se ptember 11  pointed to
weaker economic activity than the staff had anticipated at the time o f the August
FOM C meeting .  Since then, in resp onse to the dislo cations to econ omic activity
arising from the terrorist attacks, the further drop in equity prices, and an expected
markin g down of  househ old and  busine ss con fidence, the st aff h as re vised down
substantially its near -term outloo k and now  shows a m ild downtu rn in real GD P in
the Greenbook thi s year and only  a modest uptick,  on balance,  in the fir st half of
2002.  In light of thi s much weaker outlook, the staff has  assumed that the federal
funds rate will be reduced another 50 bas is points this fa ll and then held steady at 2½
percent until it is raised gradually in the second half of 2003.  Fiscal policy is assumed
to provide a moderate im petus to growth over the next tw o years.  Long-term interest
rates are expected  to hold at abo ut their curren t levels into early nex t year and then  to
drift down, the dollar to depreciate slightly, and equity prices to fall in the near term
on earnings di sappointments but  to trend highe r thereaf ter.  With the  growth of
spending proje cted to fal l short of t hat of potent ial output gr owth until mid 2002 , the
unemplo yment rate is exp ected to reach 6 ¼ percen t and then to d ecline just slightly
toward the end of t he forecas t period.  The  resulti ng slack in r esources,  as well as t he
pass-thro ugh effect s of lower oil  prices,  allows core PCE and CPI inf lation to e dge
down to 1½ percent and 2¼ percent, respectively,  in 2003.
(9) If the Committee, like the staff, saw a high probability of protracted
economic weakness  ahead and, as  a consequence,  a substanti al rise i n the
unemploym ent rate and a decline in core inflation, it presumably would  ease policy
further, as ass umed in the Greenbook.  The Comm ittee may see the sta ff forecast as
embodying an appreci able enough downward revi sion to the pr ospects f or spending
and inflation pressures to justify reducing the intended federal funds rate 50 basis

points  at this meet ing.  The equil ibrium real f ederal funds  rate, whic h summarizes the
more persist ent factor s shaping spe nding and pressur es on resource s, is now
estimated t o be about a full  percentage poi nt lower than was  thought at the  time of
the August meeting according to the measures based on the staf f forecast as well  as
historic al data (as  discussed i n the box).  Even i f the Committee di d not think that  the
factors de pressing s pending were li kely to be l ong lasting e nough to lower the
equilibrium real funds rate t o that extent, those f orces still might be s een as
sufficiently persistent to  warrant add itional policy easin g for a time.  In ad dition, with
household  and busines s confidence p ossibly fragile, the C ommittee  may consid er it
important to be s een as moving aggre ssively  with another hal f percenta ge point
easing.  Indeed, giv en the prevailing expectat ion among market participants of such an
action, the Committee might be concerned that a smaller -sized ease could tri gger an
inappropr iate tightening o f other financial co nditions that co uld prove esp ecially
prob lemat ic give n the r emain ing str ains in  the fin ancial  mark et infra struct ure. 
Moreover, the Committe e may believe  that, i f aggregat e demand proves to be
surprisingly stron g, the cost of havin g eased policy a little to o much a t this time wo uld
be relati vely small  given that i nflation e xpectati ons are lik ely to remai n well contai ned.
(10) Investors have  largely priced in a  ½ percen tage point easin g at this
meeting, along with a characterization of the balance o f risks as pointed toward
econom ic weakness.  A ccordingly, finan cial market price s likely would b e little
changed if s uch expectat ions were rea lized.  As al ways, the pr ess rele ase will be
scrutinized for hints of the Comm ittee’s policy intention going forward, and any sense
in the statement that there were higher-than-expected o dds of subsequent policy
easing  wou ld trig ger a d ownw ard ad justm ent of t he exp ected p ath of t he fun ds rate . 
In that cir cumstance, s hort- and int ermediate- term intere st rates  would likely  decline
and equity prices increase.

Equilibrium Real Federal Fund s Rate Estimates
One way to assess the stance of monetary polic y is by comparing the actual real
federal funds rate t o estimates of its e quilibrium level.  The equili brium real federal
funds rate can be defined as t he rate consistent wit h output being at its potential
level once the effects o f transitory shock s–those with  dynamics th at play out w ithin
a few years–ha ve dissipa ted.  Chart 4 s hows the range spa nned by five e stimates of
the equilibrium federal funds ra te calculated by Board staf f, as well as t he actual real
federal funds rate and the real funds rates implied by the po licy alternatives
discussed i n the text.   (The real f unds rate is  measured as the  nominal federa l funds
rate less the lagged four-quarter change in core PC E prices as a proxy for expected
inflatio n.)
The recent beha vior of thes e measures is  shown in the tabl e below the char t.  The
two estimates of the equilibrium rate based o n the historical data have declined over
the intermee ting period be cause curre nt-quarter  activit y now appears li kely to be
weaker t han had pre viousl y been ant icipat ed.  The t wo measures  of the e quilibr ium
rate based on the historical data augmented  by the staff projection have declined
considerabl y further,  reflect ing the much weaker a ssessment of  aggregate de mand
embodied in the staff forecas t.  By contrast,  the estimate of the equil ibrium federal
funds rate based on indexed T reasury yields has changed little.
The revisions to  the measure s of the equilibriu m funds ra te, while substan tial in
some cases,  are fair ly modest rel ative to t he uncertai nty associ ated with the
estimates .  In the ca se of the s tatist ical fi lter method,  standard err ors of the
estimates can be calcula ted.  For 2001Q3, these standards  errors imply that a 90-
percent conf idence inte rval is r oughly 2¼ percenta ge points on ea ch side of t he
point  estim ate.

(11) Easing policy 25 basis po ints at this meet ing might be see n by the
Committee as suff icient t o induce an adequat e recovery of  economic growth over  the
time frame that  such policy a ction would be fe lt on spending.   The Committee might
be especially inclined  to adopt this o ption if it had reaso n to suspect tha t aggregate
demand would snap back relatively promptly.  For example, t he Committee may read
the curr ent poli tical climate  as indi cating  that a c onsider able deg ree of f iscal stimulus
is in the offing.   Or the Comm ittee may be of the view that much  of the adverse
effects of the terrorist attacks on confidence is likely to be short lived.  In any case,
the outlook fo r fiscal policy, the state of co nfidence, and th e econom y more gen erally
is quite uncertain at this time, and the Com mittee may prefer to await further
developments before com mitting to a larger policy action.  If events turn more
adverse than expected in coming  weeks, an additional easing step could be taken even
before the nex t meeting.  In co ntrast, should ag gregate dem and prove r esilient, this
relatively modest ease would provide a b it more assurance of eventually bringing core
inflati on down.
(12) The announcem ent of a 25 basis point easing would surp rise market
participa nts, li kely prompting a  rise in i nterest r ates, pa rticular ly at the s hort end of the
yield curve, as well  as a decline in stock pri ces.  While the market fully e xpects an
announcement that t he risks r emain tilt ed toward weakness , a more expli cit sugges tion
of the Committee’ s readines s to conside r further s teps, ev en in the int ermeeting
perio d, wou ld wo rk to lim it the m arket r eactio n to th is polic y choi ce.  
(13) Under the Greenbook forecast, the growth of domestic nonfinanci al
debt is expected  to remain su bdued in th e months a head.  The fed eral governm ent is
foreca st to res ume p aying  dow n deb t, albeit  at a slo wer ra te than  earlier  this yea r. 
Househ old and bu siness debt is pro jected to contin ue to expand  moderately  in
reflect ion of the weak out look for consumer  and investment s pending.  Much of the
- 12 -
bulge in emergency financing pro vided by banks imm ediately following the terrorist
attack should b e repaid quick ly, as bond and  paper mar kets have ma de considerab le
progress in retu rning to m ore norm al operations.  H owever, in light o f the likely
increased perce ption of and  lessened willingn ess to take on risk, inv estors will
probably rem ain more ca utious in exten ding credit to lo wer-rated firm s, as reflected in
widened risk s preads sinc e the terr orist act ions.  Home mortgage borr owing should be
fairly well maintained because of continuing low  interest rates.
(14) Under the  assumption s of the Green book forecast, M 2 growth is
projected t o slow to a 5½ percent  pace over the  September-to- March period, owing
to declines  in household inc omes, the waning o f effec ts on money demand of the
cumulative policy easings, and the running o ff of balances bloated by market
disruptions .  Over the four  quarters of  2001, M2 is expe cted to post  robust growth of
around 10 percent , boosted not  only by decli nes in the oppor tunity cos t of holding
money but al so by the  surge i n mortgage r efinan cings,  by unusual  demands for  U.S.
currency, especially in Argentina, and by the reduced attractiveness of stock m arket
investments relativ e to deposits and money funds.  Partly bec ause of these special
factors,  the veloci ty of M2 is expec ted to drop at a  record annual r ate of 6¾ percent
this year, faster than w ould be pre dicted by the tra ditional relationsh ip of velocity to
opportunity costs.
