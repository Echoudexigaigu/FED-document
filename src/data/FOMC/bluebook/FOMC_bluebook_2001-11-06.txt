 
Prefatory Note  
 
 
The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from  the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserv e System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensiv e digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a re daction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redact ed passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable

1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and we re not checked or corrected by staff. 
  1.  Financial markets generally f unctioned normally over the intermeeting peri od (as
discussed in the  box on p age 2), and the  few rema ining strains had little ne t effect on interest
rates.
  2.  Ove r the interm eeting pe riod, the f ederal fu nds rate tra ded at an  average  of 2.47  percen t,
close to its i ntended level of 2-1/2 percent, and intraday volat ility in t he funds rate was
somewhat bel ow normal, pr obably as  the res ult of a  temporar y boost i n requir ed reser ve

Brokers and  dealers in mo ney and cap ital markets gen erally have return ed to
more normal o perations since September 11, though  some are still at contingency
sites, and the hardes t-hit firms have not regai ned their market shares.  Bott lenecks

weeks, owing  in part to the reo pening of the  on-the-run ten -year Treasury issu e in
early October.  The limits on the D esk’s securities lending program that had been
relaxed after Sep tember 11 to  enhance the a vailability of securities in sh ort supply
were reinst ituted on October 1 8.  In the f inancing market , however, r epo rates on

addition,  the market had t o digest cons iderable ne ws on the volume and composi tion
of Treasury issu ance going fo rward.  As to  the volum e of issuance, ma rket participants
apparently now expect a fiscal package imp lying a larger deterioration in the budget
balance than previously anticipated.  As to the com position of issuance, just yesterday,
the Treasury a nnounced  the suspension  of future sales of thirty -year securities (both
nominal and indexed  to inflation) and hinted that it would scale back its buy-back
prog ram.3  Yields on priv ate securi ties als o moved sharply lower  over the int ermeeting
period, particularly in the past two days (although it has been d ifficult to get firm
readings of late given volatile market conditions).  Despite the sense of a weaker n ear-

term outlook, investors seemed to beco me somewh at more confident about lon ger-
term economic prospe cts and more will ing to take on r isk:  Yiel d spreads on
speculative-grade bonds fe ll substantiall y over the period, albei t to levels well above
those in ear ly September.   Moreover, even wit hout much in the way of e ncouraging
news regard ing third-qua rter and prosp ective earnings, the W ilshire index rose a bout 5
percen t over t he inte rmee ting p eriod  and th e Nas daq re boun ded 18  percen t. 
(3) The dollar’ s exchange val ue has rise n modestly agai nst other major
currencies on balance since  the October meeting.  With data for foreign industri al
economies also coming  in on the weak side of expectations, market interest rates
abroad declined about as m uch as in the United States.  Policy interest rates were
lowered 75 b asis points in C anada and  25 basis points in  the United K ingdom .  While
the ECB did n ot adjust its policy stance during the intermeeting period, near-dated
euribor futures appear to embed  expectations of some easing by year-end and  further
moves in early  2002.  Major equi ty indexes  rose 4 to 8 per cent over the  intermeeti ng
period in German y, the United Kingdom , and Japan, more than reversing declines
recorded in Sept ember.  Over the i ntermeeting pe riod,                                               
                                                                                                           U.S. monetary
authorities did not intervene.
(4) The dollar’s average exchange value against the currencies of ou r other
important tra ding partners  changed lit tle on net ove r the inter meeting period.   The
Mexican p eso strengthen ed 2-1/2 perc ent against the d ollar, more tha n rolling back  its
declines i n the after math of the Septe mber 11 terrori st attac ks.  The rec ent
announcement that t he Argentine gove rnment would seek t o restruct ure its debt
further intensified fea rs of a default, wide ning Arg entina’s EM BI+ spread  by 600 basis
points, on ba lance, ove r the inter meeting period.   Reflecti ng some spillov er from
Argentina, t he Brazilia n real depreciat ed against t he dollar,  but only modestl y as the
authorities offset som e of that pressure  by sales of dollar-in dexed debt.  In  general,

risk spre ads for most othe r emerging market  economies incr eased only s lightly,  on
net, an d shar e price s show ed mi xed ch anges . 
(5) Despite the slowing of the economy and the disruptions i n financial
markets ass ociated wit h the September 11 a ttacks,  the debt of hous eholds and
businesses has apparently continued to expan d at a moderate rate.  The bond  market
absorbed a su bstantial amo unt of issuance  by investmen t-grade firms in b oth
September and October.   Better-r ated specul ative-gr ade firms were  able to tap t he
market in October after a near shu tdown of junk issuance in Sep tember.  Net issuance
of commercial paper also resum ed in October, after a fall-off the prior month, in part
to repay backup lines at banks that had been  drawn upon in S eptember.  Banks report
a further t ightening of  terms and standa rds on busines s loans, but  the extent  of the
tightening did  not exceed th at reported earlier  in the year, and n o widesprea d cut-off
of credit  supply seems i n train.  House hold mortgage borrowi ng has maintaine d a
fairly brisk pace , aided by a further reduct ion in mortgage interest rate s that has
triggered ano ther wave of m ortgage refinan cings.  Consu mer credit, in co ntrast, likely
continued to ex pand sluggishl y through September,  restrai ned in part by t he
redire ction o f som e cash e xtract ed fro m m ortga ge refin ancin g to de bt con solida tion. 
In part boosted by a sizable expansi on of federal debt to finance  the last round of tax
rebate checks, the to tal debt of the no nfinancial sectors g rew at a 7 perce nt pace in
Septe mber . 
(6) After a surge in September th at owed importantly to the tem porary
buildup of deposits when secu rities trades failed to settle, the level of M2 declined
slightl y in October.  Neve rtheless , this monet ary aggregat e grew at an ave rage rate of
12 percent over the past two m onths, reflecting the sharp drop in market interest rates
and perhaps a fillip from the deposit of som e tax rebates.  The velocity of M2 declined
at a 7-1/4 percen t rate through  the first three quar ters of the year, in respo nse mainly
to the subst antial re duction in opport unity cost s associa ted with poli cy easings  and

perhaps as well to some effect s on money demand of mortgage refinancings, tax
rebates, and the d isenchantm ent of househ old investors w ith the stock m arket.

Policy Alternatives
(7) The staff has read incoming econo mic information as suggesting a m ore
pronoun ced near-term  contraction th an projected in  the last Greenb ook, owing  to
weaker capit al spending and more  aggressiv e inventory  liquidati on.  The Greenbook
forecast now assumes that the fe deral funds rate will be c ut an additional
1/4 percentage point, to 2-1/4 percent, by year-end, and w ill remain at this level
through 2002 bef ore rising  modestly.  Yi elds on long- term Treasury s ecuritie s and
mortgages are e xpected to cha nge littl e from their c urrent leve ls, but t hose on
investment-grade corporate bon ds are projected to decline somewh at as risk
premiums unwind further .  The dollar  is assumed to hol d near current  levels on
foreign exc hange markets.   After some near- term softeni ng related t o disappointi ng
corporate earn ings, equity prices sh ould trend u p gradually, albe it on an appr eciably
higher track than expected in t he September Greenbook.  The impetus from fiscal
policy is now expected to provide a b igger boost to activity in 2002 and 2003.  Against
this policy and fin ancial backdro p, the staff expects real G DP to turn  up noticeab ly in
the spring.   Although output growth beg ins to outpac e that of i ts potenti al in the
second half of n ext year, the typical lag in  the response o f the unemp loyment rate
explains why i t continues  to edge higher  until mid 2002 a nd only slips  off late r in the
forecast  period.  With the  emergence of s ome labor market sl ack, core  PCE inflation
edges lower to 1-1/4 percent in 2003.
(8) The Com mittee migh t choose to leav e the federal fund s rate  unchanged
if it were  of the view t hat action a t this meeti ng would be unlikel y to affec t the
contours of t he near-te rm economic downturn and that  past monetary pol icy easi ng,
probable n ew fiscal measu res, and the natu ral resiliency of private  demand  should
provide enough stimu lus to underpin a solid econom ic recovery before long.  In
effect, the Committee would im plicitly be making the judgment that the g ap between
the current  real funds r ate and its  likely e quilibrium val ue provides a s ufficie nt amount
8
of impetus to e conomic activi ty over ti me (see chart  and table).   Indeed, the
Committee may be especially reluctant t o ease policy if i t thinks the equilibri um real
funds rate is likely to r ise in the future– as risk and equ ity premium s narrow, as is
seemingly consistent with re cent stock price gains , but also as the thrust  of fiscal
policy intensifi es.  With the budget package stil l working its way through the legisl ative
process, considerabl e uncertainty surrounds the magnitude of the c oming fiscal
stimulus.   Because this  uncertaint y should be res olved relat ively promptl y, the
Comm ittee may prefer to  keep policy un changed at th is meeting so a s to be able to
calibrate better its policy action to the size and composition of wh at becomes law.  If
the Committee saw eas ing as a clos e call,  with the fede ral funds ra te as low as 2 -1/2
percent,  it might be arg ued that act ion should be def erred at thi s meeting so t hat the
Committee would have more sc ope to respond to po tential  adverse shoc ks down the
road.  As described in the box on the zero bound to nominal interest  rates on page 9,
this tactic of “saving your ammun ition” would follow from  the judgment that policy
action in a narr ow wind ow follow ing an advers e shock wo uld be mo re effective in
bolsteri ng activit y over time tha n lowering rat es more aggress ively now so t hat any
future shock falls on a stronger econom y.
(9) Committee inacti on at this meet ing, even i f combined with a s tatement
reaffirming the assessment of predom inant downside risks, would surprise m arket
participa nts.  Conside rable doubts woul d be created a bout whether the f ederal funds
rate would go as low as 1-3/4 p ercent by the early months of next year as m arket
participants cur rently expect.  In co nsequence, oth er short-term in terest rates wou ld
move noticeably  higher.  The l ikely upward movement of  bond yields would be
tempered by an immediat e sellof f of equiti es.  To the ex tent that t he outlook for
spending an d income tu rned gloom ier, the exchange v alue of the dolla r might fail to
appreciate despite the tighter-than-anticipated policy stance.

The Ze ro Bound  to the Nom inal Interest Rate
With the overnight interest  rate at 2-1/2 percent, t he zero bound to the nominal
interes t rate may l oom larger now in the  Committee’s del iberati ons than at any  time in the
past four decades.  The expe rience of Japan, in which the po licy rate has flirted with zero
for five yea rs and economic perf ormance has been dis mal, serves a s a cautionar y note for
monet ary policy mak ers.  Of c ourse, the sh ort-term ra te in the  Unit ed St ates is still some
dista nce away fr om zero, and  inter mediate-  and longer -term ra tes her e remain f ar above
levels seen in Japan.  Even if Committee members were to consider the zero bound as
potentia lly relevan t, observ ers have  put forw ard two  quite diff erent ap proach es to
avoiding a situation i n which the economy is weak and further reductions in the nominal
policy rate are not possi ble.
     1. “Saving your am munition.”   It may be vi ewed as qui te poss ible t hat adver se shocks
will emerge in the near term; in part icular, global events  could prompt further
down drafts in h ouseho ld and b usiness co nfidenc e.  The C omm ittee may  want to
be able to count er such advers e outcomes by easi ng, on the expect ation that  being
seen as responsive to current  events helps to bolster  confidence.  Action taken
now limits the scope for such future monetary poli cy reaction to confidence-
shaking eve nts.
     2. Respondin g preemptively  to skewed risks.   If it were accep ted that policy op tions would
be severely c urtaile d should the fede ral funds ra te hit i ts zero fl oor and that t he
adverse conseque nces would be potent ially qui te large,  the Committee might want
to act now to re duce the possi bility  of that out come.  That is,  the cost of  easing
too much  currently ma y weigh less in th e Com mittee’s conside ration than the c ost
of easing insuffici ently now and winding up pinned to the zero bound at a later
date.
     
Staff anal ysis of t he zero bound tends t o support the l atter vi ew:  Avoiding the
zero boun d counsels m ore aggressive a ction in adva nce of zero in  response to ad verse
shocks  than is the  norm .  More over, tim ely policy  actions tak en soon er wou ld work  to
put the economy on a stronger footing when adverse shocks subsequently hit .  But that
determinati on would be less per suasive if  the Committee’s  view, as opposed t o the
mechanisms embodied in most econometric models, was that its action could have a
greater effect on c onfidence, a nd hence  the econom y, if taken on the  heels of an ad verse
shoc k or t hat monet ary policy op erations co uld s till adequa tely stimulate the econ omy
even if the no minal short-term  interest rate were ze ro. 
    
10
(10) The Committee may consider  the staf f forecas t to be both probabl e and,
under the circ umstances, a satisfac tory outcom e, and it may jud ge that an im mediate
cut in the federal fu nds rate of 25 basis points is justi fied.  With i nvestors s kittis h and
risks predom inately skewed to  the down side, the Com mittee may b e reluctant to
adopt a policy stance that is appreciably tighter than financial markets expect, which
could further  adversely affect hou sehold and b usiness sentim ent.  The sma ll
disappointment of market expectations i mplied by the adoption of this alte rnative
might actuall y be viewed fa vorably by the  Committee if it  wished to slow t he current
pace of easi ng from its re cent traj ectory to he lp forest all fina ncial market s from
building in the expectati on of considerably more easing than appropriate  to achieve
the Committee’s  objective s.  In eff ect, a modest  disappointment  now may pose less of
a strain  on m arkets  than a  more  sizabl e one l ater on . 
(11) The Committee may judge that a 50 basis po int policy mov e is
warranted on the  grounds that t he path of output  is likel y to fall  short of tha t in the
staff foreca st–eit her beca use the c ontract ion will  be great er or the  subseque nt picku p
less robust.  The C ommittee  might anticip ate the near-term  outcome s for spending  to
be weaker than i n the staf f outlook if , for example , it sus pected that  the ongoing
contracti on of foreign  economic acti vity and the  stresse s in financ ial markets  of
developi ng countri es may port end great er-tha n-anti cipate d advers e feedba cks on U.S.
production.  The Co mmittee may also have d oubts that household and  business
spending w ill respond as vig orously to likely fiscal in itiatives as embed ded in the staff
forecast.  Even if t he Committee viewed a 50 basis point move as a bit larger t han
necessary given its  current assessment of the e conomic situation, the more substanti al
move might be favored if some weight were placed on the possibil ity of shocks that
would be sufficiently adver se to make the zero bound to nominal interest rates  a real
const raint o n the e ffective ness o f mon etary p olicy a t som e poin t in the  future .  
(12) As already noted, market participants are abou t evenly split between
11
expec ting 1/ 4 perc entag e poin t and 1 /2 per centag e poin t of easi ng at th is mee ting. 
Thus , some  portio n of th em w ould b e disap point ed by t he cho ice of ei ther ac tion. 
Working to temper any reaction, though, would be the sense that  it is more likely t hat
the timing of  the easing t hey are expec ting–in the ne ighborhood of 3/4 per centage
points over the next half year–had chang ed, not the cumulative amou nt.  Market
participants universally expect that the balance of risks will remain tilted toward
economic weakness , so not much would be re ad in its r etention.   A 25 basis point
easing would prompt s ome backup in short-  and intermediat e-term rate s and a decli ne
in equity pri ces.  A half  point ease,  in contrast , would pull sh ort-term rat es lower and,
unless counte red by a clear sen se in the stateme nt that the Co mmittee h ad viewed its
action as likely brin ging this easing p hase to a close, wo uld lead m arket participants  to
mark down the entire  expected pat h of policy r ates.  The i mplied support t o spending
would likely bolster equity markets and offset to a considerab le extent any downward
pressure on the exchange value of the do llar directly emanating from lower interest
rates.
(13) Given the funds rate assump tion in the staff forecast, M2 growth over
the October-to- March interval  is expect ed to fall  appreciabl y, to about a  7-1/2 percent
annual rate.  The effec ts on opportunity costs of the pre vious easings, as wel l as that
of the f urthe r 25 ba sis poi nt cut  in the s taff pro jection , shou ld aba te over  time. 
Together with t he Greenbook’s f orecast f or nominal GDP, the impli ed rate of de cline
in M2 velo city lessens from a bout 10-1/2  percent in the cu rrent quarter to

(14) Over the six months from September to March, the staff projects  that
growth of the t otal debt of  domestic nonfi nancial se ctors will  slip to a 4- 1/2 percent
rate, reflecting a slowin g in the expan sion of house hold debt.  C onsumer  credit
borro wing  is expe cted to  be esp ecially  light, o wing  to dep ressed  spend ing on  durab les. 
Even the g rowth of ho me mo rtgage debt, w hich has been  exceptionally ro bust in

keeping with t he decline i n mortgage rates , is see n as taili ng off a li ttle as r efinanci ngs
diminish an d housing a ctivity slows.  Busin ess borrowin g is likely to stay arou nd its
third-quarter pace, concentrated in the corporate bon d market.  Neither banks, which
have been tightening terms and stan dards on C& I loans, nor the commercial paper
market, which a lso has become more s electiv e, are ant icipated t o be major sources  of
funds.  Federal d ebt should b e rising at only a 1/ 2 percent ann ual rate, as the bud get is
foreseen to be in a modest deficit position on average o ver this six months.
