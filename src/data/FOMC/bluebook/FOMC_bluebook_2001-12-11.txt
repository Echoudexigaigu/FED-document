 
Prefatory Note  
 
 
The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from  the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserv e System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensiv e digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a re daction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redact ed passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    
 
                                                
 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and we re not checked or corrected by staff. 
1 The federal funds rate has averaged very cl ose to its int ended level of 2 percent over
the inter meeting peri od.  The Desk purchased $8. 6 billion of  Treasury sec urities  in outright
operations over the period, i ncluding $3.3 billion of Treasury bi lls ($1.3 bill ion of which was
from foreign off icial i nstitut ions) and $5. 3 billion of  coupon securit ies.  To accommodate t he

Recent D evelopm ents
(1) In advance o f the Novem ber FOM C meeting , investors were u ncertain
whether the Com mittee would choose to ease po licy 25 or 50 basis points, but they
seemed sure that the Committee would continue to view the risks t o the outlook as
weighted to ward econ omic wea kness.  In the even t, the announ cement of th e 50 basis
point rate cut–along with the expected statem ent of unbalanced risks–led market
participants to mark down  short- and intermediate-term interest rates and to boost
equity pric es, while  leaving lon ger-term rat es about unchange d.1  Subsequent
economic data came in  on the high side of expectations on balance, and  with military
oper ations i n Afg hanistan maki ng su bstantial prog ress, inves tors appeared to bec ome
more  optim istic ab out ec onom ic pro spects  and in creasin gly wi lling to  take o n risk. 
Futures m arket quotes in dicate that investo rs place high o dds on a furth er 25 basis
point easing move at this meeting; the federal funds rate is apparen tly expected to rise
thereafter, reaching  about 4¾  percent by the  end of 2003– a level about 10 0 basis
point s high er than  was ex pected  at the t ime o f the N ovem ber m eeting  (Cha rt 1).

the ebbing of flight-t o-safety demands, yiel ds on Treasury coupon securities have

With concerns about t he economic outlook  diminishing,  yields on i nvestment-gr ade
corporate bo nds have incr eased consider ably less than tho se on com parable
Treasuries, while yields on speculative-grade bonds have declined  substantially,
bringing risk spreads on such bon ds back to the levels of early September.  The failure
of Enron Corporation,  a major wholesal e energy tra ding firm, put  some pressure on
the securities of  firms in similar and relat ed businesses, as well  as on those of banks
thought to h ave substantial ex posures to E nron.  Altho ugh liquidity in  energy mar kets
was reportedly reduced and price movements were volatil e at times, eff ects in financial
markets more generally were m uted.  Broad stock price indexes have increased
roughly 6 p ercent over the p eriod, while the N asdaq has risen  more than  14 percent.

Financi al Market  Conditi ons
Over th e interm eeting pe riod, inter est rates ha ve been  especially  volatile an d appe ar to
have been  unusually sen sitive to econom ic news and  statements by o fficials.  In part, this
may owe to the uncertainty surrounding the current  economic outlook as market
partici pants seek out  clues as t o whether an economic re bound is at hand.   In the
Treasury market , some of the backup i n yields proba bly represe nted an unwinding of t he
abrupt decli nes that f ollowed the announcement  on October 31 of the s uspension of
issuan ce of thi rty-y ear bonds.   Overall,  upward movements  in long- term yie lds may have
been am plified to som e extent by inv estors’ attempts to red uce the dura tion of their
portfolios as high er rates trimme d the prepay ment risk of m ortgage-back ed securities.
Market reports  suggest t hat the Treas ury market has bee n less li quid than typi cal, perhaps
contributing to the volat ility in yi elds.  Bid-asked spreads on Treasury s ecurities widened
at times, and the amounts bid or offered have been smaller  than usual.  Some market
participants have report edly closed out positions a head of year-end and may have been
reluctant to assume new p ositions ami d the  extensive vo latility of asset prices.  Some
withdrawa l from th e market as sociat ed with ye ar-end pos ition ing als o may have
contributed to a recent r ise in fails- to-deliver Treasury secur ities, al though the elevated
level of fails likely also  reflects the low lev el of short-term in terest rates.
To date, year-end pressures i n financing markets have generally been in t he range
observed in recent years.  I n the federal funds and eurodollar deposit  markets, the rates at
which  banks c an borr ow fun ds over  year-en d have  risen on ly slightly re lative to th e rate
on Treasury repurchase agreements of similar  maturity (Chart 2).  Simil arly, highly rat ed
firms in the  commercial paper market  have had to pay only a  small premium to borr ow
funds over  year-e nd.  Sprea ds for l ower-rat ed issu ers of c ommercial p aper, whi ch have
been elevated since Septem ber, have increased noticeably for instrumen ts spanning year-
end.

(4) Deepening concerns  over the Argenti ne government’s  chances of
staving off default apparently have had little spillover to other emerging m arket
economies, and the dollar’s exchange value against the cu rrencies of our other
impo rtant t radin g part ners h as decl ined so mew hat ov er the i nterm eeting  perio d. 
Argentine off icials  began to implement a  debt exchange a nd, faced wit h mounting
pressures on th e nation’s bank s, announced  a set of measur es to limit withd rawals
from the banking system and to restrict  capital outflows.  On balance,  the yield spread
of Argentina’ s debt over Tre asuries ha s risen more t han 900 basis  points over t he
period.  In contrast,  in Mexico and Brazil, bond yield spreads over Treas uries have
narrowed substantially.  The M exican peso has changed little on net against the dollar,
but the Brazil ian real has apprecia ted 6½ percent.   Stock prices  in Asian devel oping
economies with significant technology-based ex port sectors have posted increases
between 10  and 30 perce nt.
(5) Nonfeder al debt has exp anded at abo ut a 5¾ pe rcent average p ace in
recent months ( Chart 3).  Despi te declini ng investment s pending, busi ness debt
growth appears t o have picked up i n October and November.  Low yie lds on
investment-grade bonds evidently hav e encouraged many firm s to lock-in longer-term

(6) M2 growth, at a 9¼ percent rate in November, remained robust but was
below its average pace over Septem ber and October, ow ing in part to some further
unwinding of the hi gh level of  business demand de posits tha t accumulated i n the
aftermath of  the Se ptember  terrorist attacks an d that  were no t compl etely drawn
down until late in October.  Growth in M2 money funds slowed appreciably as
reduced concerns about the eco nomic outlook and  increases in equity values likely led
some investor s to reall ocate balanc es from money funds ba ck into equit ies.  Inde ed,
there were i nflows into e quity mutual funds  in November followi ng a sizable o utflow
in September and little net change i n October.  For the year, M2 is estimated to have
expanded 10¼ percent  on a four-quart er basis,  compared with proje cted growth of
nominal in come of on ly 1½ percen t.  M2 grow th was boo sted largely by de clines in
opportunity co sts, t he heavy pace of  mortgage refi nancing, and t he disenchant ment of
investors  with the stoc k market.  (An appe ndix contains  a discussi on of money and

Short-run Policy Alternatives
(7)  On balan ce, economic  data over the in termeeting p eriod have ten ded to
run somewhat firmer  than had been expe cted by the s taff at  the time of t he
November meeting, and e quity price s have rise n.  As a consequenc e, the Greenbook
forecast for real  activity has been st rengthened slightly.   Under the assumption that
the Committee lea ves the tar get funds rat e unchanged through 20 02 before f irming
policy duri ng 2003, the  staff pr ojects t hat long-te rm interest  rates wil l drift down a
little, the foreign exchange value of the dollar will hold near its current level, and stock
prices will stay about flat through next year and edge high er thereafter.  The forecast
again assumes the passage of le gislation that will  provide substantial addit ional fiscal
stimulus starting  in the first half of next y ear.  Against this b ackdrop, real G DP is
anticipated to fla tten out early next year  and then rebound to a growth rate somewhat
above that of its potential over the remainder of the pro jection period.  The near-term
decline in output is expect ed to push the unemployment rate to about 6 percent next
year, and unemploym ent then edges lower over 2003.  The slack in resou rce
utilization, decl ining en ergy cos ts, and r educ ed inflation ex pectations l ead t o some
diminutio n of underlyin g inflation, with th e increase in the co re PCE in dex falling to
about 1 perc ent in 2003 from  its recent peak of ab out 2 percen t.
(8) Even though the prospe ct of furt her near-t erm deteriora tion in the
economy is unappea ling, the Committee m ay view this outcome as unavo idable given
the lags in mo netary policy.  If the C ommittee  saw good  prospects of a rela tively
strong rebound i n the economy beginni ng in the next f ew quarters,  it might lea ve the
stance of monetary policy unchanged .  The unexpected strength of several indicators
of consum ption and in vestment cou ld be read as su pporting a v iew that econ omic
weakness is ab ating and a tu rnaround  in spending  is in train.  Indeed, the  rise in equity
prices and real in terest rates of late likely pro vides evidence th at market par ticipants
- 8 -
have become m ore optimistic on that score.  Such a turnarou nd would be sup ported
by the monetary stimulus pu t in place–a substantial portion of which has occu rred
only recent ly–that has  positioned t he real fe deral funds r ate well bel ow the range of
estimates of its equilibrium value (see Chart 4 and the tab le on the next page).  In
these circums tances, the Com mittee may w ish to bide its tim e, awaiting data th at will
help it gauge  the effe cts of poli cy actions  to date as wel l as the re solution of
uncertainty on  the fiscal policy fron t.
(9) Because m arket prices app ear to incorpo rate high odd s on a 25 basis
point easing of monetary policy at  this meeting, leavi ng the target federal f unds rate at
2 perc ent wo uld pr omp t an ap precia ble inc rease in  mon ey ma rket in terest r ates. 
Longer-term yields could rise somew hat as well; the extent of the backup, however,
would probably be lim ited as long as the Comm ittee, as expected by investors,
reiterated its assessm ent that the balan ce of risks is weighte d toward e conomic
weakness.  H owever, long -term yields wo uld likely rise by m ore, and the do llar could
firm, if the Com mittee’s annou ncement su ggested som e optimism  about econ omic
prospects de spite it s formal ass essment of th e balance of  risks and,  especial ly, if the
Committee shift ed to a stat ement that the  risks were  balanced.  Equi ty prices  might
drop initially,  but, again, any sense  conveyed in the announcement of good odds that
the economy wo uld begin to recover before long w ould probably limit the decline.
(10) The Com mittee might choose to ease policy  25 basis po ints if it viewed
the recent  positive n ews on spending as  quite tent ative and not  providing suf ficient
assurance t hat a rebound is  in store bef ore long.  Moreover , the Committee might  be
worr ied ab out th e poss ibility o f specif ic shoc ks that  could  derail  the rec overy . 
Consumer sentiment coul d decline f urther in the  event of addi tional te rrorist a ctions
or if th e curr ent m ilitary c onflic t prov es mo re diffic ult an d pro tracted  than e xpecte d.

earnings as  well as an unusua lly low equit y risk premium.   Should investor
expectations be disappointed or t he equity premium move back toward its historical
norm, equ ity prices could re verse their recent g ains, adding to th e drag on h ousehold
spending.  I n addition,  the appearanc e of stal emate in the Congre ssional de bate on a
fiscal  stimulus pack age may be seen as  raising t he odds that agr eement will not  be
forthc oming.  An al ternat ive si mulation i n the Green book ill ustrat ed that,  without
additional fiscal stim ulus, the econo mic recovery  could be no ticeably more  anemic
than envisi oned in the base line fore cast.  While  these downside  risks may not
materialize, the Committee might view the cost  of erring on the side of eas e as low at
this time gi ven the degree  of slack a t present i n resource uti lization a nd the likel ihood
that inflation wil l remain  subd ued o r drift down s omewh at in the  near  term.
(11) Because inves tors expect the C ommittee  to ease 25 basis po ints and to
retain its ass essment that the risks a re weighted toward economic weakness, financi al
market prices would likely change little in response to such a p olicy decision.  Market
participants probably would perceive the 25  basis point move, following three larger
steps, a s an indicat ion that the  easing cyc le could be dra wing to a close .  If the
Committee wanted to under score that  perception i n markets, i t could indic ate that t he
risks were now balanced.  In that event, market interest rates could rise as investors
moved forward thei r prevaili ng expectati ons of policy  tightening , but stock  prices and
the for eign ex chang e value  of the d ollar w ould b e supp orted  if the F edera l Rese rve’s
less pess imistic out look led market  participa nts to revi se up their e xpectati ons for the
rebou nd in e cono mic ac tivity. 
(12) The Com mittee might consider reducing th e target federal funds rate 50
basis poin ts at this meet ing if it  thought an unacce ptably lar ge opening of sl ack in the
economy was likel y.  As discus sed in the box “A ‘ Perfect For esight’  Policy” on page

outlook to dete rmine a path for  the funds rat e that minimizes  squared output and
inflation gaps over the entire forecast period calls for considerable additional near-
term policy e asing to count er the proje cted upward press ure on the unemployment
rate.  A furt her sizable  easing may be j ustifie d not only on the gr ounds of generat ing
better results t han in the staff fore cast, but also on the vi ew that the forecast i tself has
overestimated effective policy stimulus or does not give sufficient weight to forces
that will c ontinue to hold ba ck the economy.   In particul ar, if i nflation e xpectati ons
are lower than is embedded  in the baseline forecast, then the real short-term interest
rate is higher and that will keep real long-term rates elevated and redu ce inflation even
further than in the staff forecast.  Adjusting the nominal funds rate low er in response
to the apparen t drop in inflation  expectations m ight be viewed  as especially desirab le
if the Committee  believed t hat substant ial rest raints to p rivate domest ic spending
persist or that the d ownturn  abroad is likely to  be exacerbated  by financial strains in
certain foreign economies.  Moreo ver, as discussed in a box in the Novem ber
bluebook, the  possibili ty that conv entional moneta ry policy a ction ulti mately could be
constrained by the zero boun d to nominal interest rates might incline the C ommittee
to take prompter  and more aggressi ve action now to s timulate ec onomic activi ty.  The
Comm ittee might also v iew the 1 perce nt core PC E inflation rate p rojected to prev ail
toward the end of the forecast interval as too low to p rovide a comfortable buffer
against hitting the zer o bound to nominal interest rates in the e vent of a substantial
adverse shock to the econom y in the future.
(13) A 50 basis p oint policy easing  at this meeting w ould be large r than is
embedded in financ ial market pr ices.  Alt hough short-te rm rates would decl ine

A “Perfect For esight” Pol icy

(14) Given the inte rest rat e assumptions a nd nominal income proje ction of
the Greenbook fore cast, M2 growth i s forecas t to slow somewhat i n coming months
from its averag e pace over 200 1, as the influence o f previous easing s on oppo rtunity
costs and the d emand for  M2 begin s to ebb.  Still, M2  growth is exp ected to rem ain
relatively bri sk:  The record surge in mortgage refi nancing that is now under way
should bu oy M2, and  continued str ong dem ands for U.S . currency abro ad owing  to
unsettled c onditions i n some countries  and, perhaps,  a temporary surg e in demands
for U.S. banknotes around the time of the i ntroduction of euro notes early next  year
could also sp ur that aggre gate.  On balanc e, M2 is expect ed to expand at a  7¾ percent
annual rate over the November-to-March period.  With M2 growth staying well above
that of nominal  income, velo city conti nues to drop in t he first  quarter, a lthough the
decline is expected to slow to a 6¼ percen t annual rate.
(15) Over the period from October to March, the expansion of nonfederal
debt is expected to remain near the 6 percen t pace of recent months.  In the business
sector, borrow ing a gain sho uld b e con centrated he avily in the  bond m arket, as firms

3  Annual growth figur es are expres sed as the cha nge from the fourt h quarter of t he
previous yea r to the fourth qu arter of the curren t year using staff pro jections.Appendix:  Review of Deb t and Money Grow th in 2001
The econo mic contractio n and declin e in interest rates this yea r left a noticeable
imprint on the comp osition of financial flows.  In general, credit flows shifted toward
bond s and m ortga ges, as b orrow ers too k adva ntage  of low er lon g-term  intere st rates . 
A decline in ca pital expe nditures and i nventory fi nancing needs l ed to a sharp s lowing
in overall busin ess borrowin g, but lower in terest rates helped to  keep househ old credit
expansion bri sk.  Federa l debt contra cted at a much sl ower pace than i n 2000, as t he
federal government resum ed net borrowing in the secon d half of the year in response
to a reemergence of unified budg et deficits.  The decline in short-term interest rates
resulting from the easing of monetary p olicy, combined with increased safe-haven
demand for liquid assets that likely reflected investors’ disenchantment with the stock
market, contributed to rapid growth of the br oad monetary aggregates in 2001.
     
Domestic Nonfinancial Se ctor Debt
Despite anem ic expansion in  nominal in come, the agg regate debt of d omestic
nonfinan cial s ectors  expanded 5 ½ percent i n 2001,  a bit f aster  than in t he previ ous
year.3  Nonfederal debt grew b riskly over the first half of the year, but slowed
somewhat in the se cond half as t he economy contrac ted.  On balance,  nonfederal de bt
decelerated to ab out 7¼ p ercent in 2001 fro m 8½ p ercent last year.  By co ntrast,
federal de bt continued t o shrink earl ier in the y ear, but t hen resumed growing i n the
secon d half, a s the b udge t swun g into  deficit  owin g to a d eterio ration  in tax r eceipt s. 
For the year as a  whole, the feder al governm ent paid dow n only 1½  percent of its
debt, all of it during the first half, compared with 6¾ percent last year.
Overall busine ss borrowing sl owed substanti ally fro m its strong pa ce of the
previous several years .  The financing gap contracted consi derably as a drop in capital
expenditures outpaced a shrinkage in intern al funds that stemmed from  weaker
profit s.  The c omp ositio n of bu siness b orrow ing sh ifted to ward  longe r-term  mark ets. 
Nonfinancial  firms, es pecially  those rate d investment gr ade, took adv antage of
attract ive longer- term intere st rates  and issued a l arge volume of bonds , using the
proceeds to s trengthen t heir balanc e sheets by  paying down bank loans  and
commercial paper and  by boosting liquid assets.  The comm ercial paper market
suffered severe setb acks in 2001, and  the level of com mercial pape r outstanding  fell
sharply over  the year.   Early on, def aults of t wo California ut ilities and downgrades of
- 16 -
the debt of other firms caused spre ads between lower- and higher-tier  issuers to soar
for a time.  More recently,  market disruptions in the wake of the Septe mber 11
terroris t attacks , consider able year- end pressures , and concerns  stemming from the
bank ruptc y of En ron C orpo ration  led spr eads fo r lowe r-rated  issuer s to wi den ag ain. 
In the banking s ector, worr ies about det eriorati ng credit qual ity in an env ironment of
declining e conomic activi ty led to a f urther tig htening of busi ness lendi ng standards
and terms over the course of the year.  Bank s reported weaker deman d for C&I loans,
mainly owing to re duced business  outlays on ca pital equi pment and inventori es and a
slower pace of  merger activ ity.  Thes e factors , along with t he shift t o financing
through the bond market , caused C&I loans  at commercial ba nks to shrink  for the
first cal endar  year sin ce 199 3.        
Growth in commercial mortg age debt remaine d brisk in 200 1, even though
nonresidential construction spending fell.  Issuance of comm ercial mortgage-backed
securities, buoyed  by low interest r ates, remained fair ly robust thro ughout 20 01.  With
offic e vacanc ies on t he rise  and deli nquency ra tes on co mmercial mor tgages  edging up
from their re cent hist orical lows , commercial ba nks, on net,  firmed standa rds on
comm ercial r eal esta te loan s. 
 
In the household sector, st rength in durable goods expenditures led t o an
accelera tion of consumer c redit in t he first  quarter.  Growth i n consumption spendi ng
slowed over the spring and sum mer, and the increase in consum er credit fell back
sharply,  resulti ng in a moderate gai n for the yea r as a whole.   By contrast,  the low
levels of mortg age rates spurred  home m ortgage deb t to a rapid 10 p ercent advanc e in
2001.
With the expansi on of overall  household debt cont inuing to outrun t hat of
disposable pe rsonal incom e, the househo ld debt-service bu rden rose fairly stead ily
over the yea r, edging c loser to t he previous pea k.  At the same t ime, the rat io of
household asse ts to dispos able income moved lower  through the thi rd quarter of  the
year, re flecti ng the decli ne in equity pr ices.  I n this envi ronment, measure s of
household credit quality deteriorated som ewhat over the year.  Delinquency rates rose
on credit cards, home mo rtgages, and other consumer loans.  Person al bankruptcy
filings shot up to a record level early in the year, and remained well abo ve their year-
earlier  levels;  part of the i ncrease,  though, ref lected a rus h to file be fore the pas sage of
bankruptcy re form legisl ation.
Despite the falling and volatile stock market, households con tinued net
purchases of eq uity mutua l funds durin g the first half of the yea r.  But when  equity
- 17 -
prices droppe d further duri ng the summer, househ olds responded by  shifti ng
investments from equities to bond  and money fund s, a pattern that became more
pron ounc ed wh en equ ity ma rkets re open ed foll owin g the te rroris t attack s. 
Encouraged by a reco very in share prices beginning in Octob er, households resumed
accumulating equity mu tual funds.
State and loc al government debt  expanded fair ly rapidly  this year , followi ng
slow growth in 2000.  Gross issuance of municipal bonds acc elerated early on,  as local
governments took a dvantage of l ower yields t o refund outst anding debt.   Spurred by
falling interest rates and  declining tax rev enues, issuance o f long-term b onds to
financ e new  capita l proje cts ma intain ed a ra pid cli p over  the co urse o f the ye ar. 
Credit quality in the municipal market appear ed to be topping out late in the year , as
tax receipts softened owing to the contracting econo my.
The federal go vernment c ontinued to  pay down  sizable amo unts of mar ketable
debt over the first hal f of the year.  By the middle of  the summer, however, the tax
cut, combined with the w eakening in the economy, led to a deterioration  in receipts,
and the Treasur y announced that i t planned to re sume borrowing over t he rest of t he
year.  Emergenc y spending in t he wake of the t errorist  attacks f urther booste d the
Treasury’s borrowing needs.  Follow ing a 6 percent rate of contraction in the first
half, t he federal  nonfinancia l debt grew at a  3¼ percent pace ove r the second hal f of
2001.
Depository Credit
Growth of depository credit this ye ar was well below that of total nonfi nancial
debt.  Bank cre dit decelerated sign ificantly over the co urse of the year as lo an growth
slowed sharply, although bank loans bulged t emporarily after September 11 as
businesses tapp ed backup  lines of credit.  An emic loan gr owth at do mestic
commercial banks f or the year a s a whole was part ially of fset by robus t acquisit ion of
securities.  The expansion of thrift credit is estimated to have slowed slightly from last
year’s pace despite th e rapid grow th in hom e mortgag e debt.
The decelerat ion in bank loans  in 2001 ref lected a dro p-off in l oan demand
from busin esses and consu mers as well as a  tightening of b anks’ lending stan dards in
response to gr owing concerns about  worsening ass et quality .  The net perc entage of
domestic banks that tightened st andards and terms on business loans, which had
trend ed up  substa ntially  in 200 0, bega n to de cline o ver the  first ha lf of the  year. 
However, in li ght of dimming economic pr ospects f ollowing the t errorist  attacks,  the
- 18 -
proportion of banks tightening business  lending policies again i ncreased.  Commercial
banks reported that the weaker demand for C&I loans over the course of t he year
owed mainly to a con tinued decline in customers’ need to finance capital expend itures,
mergers and  acquisitions, and  inventories.  In the  second half of th e year, a mode rate
net percentage of banks also started to tighten credit conditions for hou sehold loans.
Monetary A ggregates
M2 expanded  at a rapid 10¼ percent pace this year, significantly above its 6
percent rate of gr owth in 200 0.  The fallout from  the events of Se ptember 11  is
estimated to have directly contributed only a bit to M 2 growth in 2001.  Mo re
signifi cantly,  sharp decli nes in short -term inter est rate s, resul ting from the e asing of
monetary polic y over the ye ar, lowere d the opportunit y cost of hol ding M2 assets a nd
helped induce a record decline in M 2 velocity.  In addition, households’ preferences
for liquidity and safety apparently intensified in response to elevated stock market
volatili ty and reduced e xpectati ons for corpora te earnings  growth, furt her boosting
M2 growth.  The unprecede nted level  of mortgage ref inancing act ivity and l arge
currency shipments abroad also sp urred this aggregate.
Reflecting in part a surge i n its M2 component, M3 grew 13½ percent in 2001,
far outpaci ng the 9½ percent r ate of incr ease las t year.  I nstituti onal money funds
experienced exceptional inflows in response to the decline in sho rt-term interest rates
in 2001.  By con trast, the flattening of b ank credit resulted  in a sharp dece leration in
the issuance of m anaged liabilities, inclu ding large tim e deposits.  W ith growth in
nominal  income s lowing  sharp ly, M3 veloc ity dr opped f or the  seven th yea r in t he row.
