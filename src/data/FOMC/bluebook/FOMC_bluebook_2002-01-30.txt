The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from  the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserv e System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensiv e digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a re daction process that removed information obtained on a

1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and we re not checked or corrected by staff.

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES
Recent D evelopm ents
(1) The Committee’s actions at its December meeting to reduce t he federal
funds rate another 25 basis point s and to retain an assess ment that the balance of risks
was weighted toward eco nomic weakness had  been widely anticipated, but investors
apparently read the announcem ent as indicating that the FOM C’s outlook for 
econom ic conditions w as softer than had  been thoug ht.  Althoug h econom ic data
releas es over t he inte rmeeting  period ge nerall y led mark et part icipan ts to mark  up
their expectation  for near-term e conomic a ctivity, the anticipated g rowth of ag gregate
demand going forward was evidently revised down in light of s peeches by several
Committee members and firms’ downbeat guidance on future revenues and capital
spending.  O n net, federal fund s futures quo tes for the next few  months ar e little
changed from thei r levels  at the time of  the December meeting  and are consis tent
with only sligh t odds of a 25 b asis point redu ction in the feder al funds rate at this
meeting.  Expectations for policy tightening later this year and next, how ever, were
trimmed 25 to 35 bas is points,  with the funds  rate now moving a li ttle above  4 percent
by fall 2003 (charts).1  Yields on nominal T reasury coupon securities were unchan ged

2  The turn o f the year passed u neventfully, and sh ort-term risk spr eads fell
back, albe it to leve ls above thos e of late s ummer.  Reports indi cate tradi ng conditions
in the U.S. Treasury market imp roved, although implied volatilities on bond futu res
contracts  remain eleva ted.to down 15 basis poi nts over the  intermeeti ng period.2  Rates on inflation-indexed
Treasury sec urities  fell as  much as those on the ir nominal counte rparts,  suggesting
little change in inflation expectations, although a survey measure of hou seholds’
longer-term inflation expectations dropped co nsiderably.  In private markets, risk
spreads on corporate bond s were little changed.  Broad equity price indexes edged
lower, on net, b ut, with earning s marked d own too, still seem  to incorpora te
expectations of rapid growth in profits.
(2) The trade-weighted index of the do llar’s exchange value against other
major currencies rose 2½ p ercent over the intermeeting period, reaching its highest
level since the mid -1980s, as mark et attention fo cused on  signs that the U.S.  econ omy
would lead the reboun d from the global slowdo wn.  The dollar appreciated
6½ percent  against  the yen,  as the J apanese  economy sa gged furt her and f itful
progress on structural ref orms continued to disappoint market participant s.  Heavy
injections of liquidity by the Bank of Japan, as well as comm ents from Japanese
officials indicating little resistance to the weakening of the yen, also may have weighed
on that curren cy.  The dollar to uched a reco rd high again st the Canad ian dollar late in
the intermee ting period a nd, on net, i ncreased about  1½ percent.  Agains t the euro,
the dollar a ppreciate d about 1 percent .  Successf ul introduct ion of euro coi ns and
notes at the start of the year gave the euro only a tempora ry boost.  Long-term
intere st rat es in th e major in dustri alized  countri es gener ally e dged highe r on net,  but
changes in st ock prices wer e mixed.      
   and U.S. monetary
authorities did not intervene.

(3) The exchange value of the do llar against the currencies of our other
important tra ding partners  increased a bout 1¼ percent duri ng the inter meeting
perio d, with  much  of that  rise stem ming  from  depre ciation  of the A rgent ine pe so. 
Under intense dom estic economic and political pressure, Argentine autho rities
abandoned support for one-to-one peso-dollar conver tibility i n favor of a dual
exchange rat e system with a  new fixed (but  devalued) ra te for cer tain trans actions and
a floating rate for all o thers.  As me asured by the  floating rate, the peso  initially
depreciat ed sharply and ha s since f luctuated i n a wide range amid dai ly interv ention
purc hases of pesos by the Arg entine cent ral bank .  Fo llowing  the default on s ome
official debt, prices of A rgentina’s bon ds, which alread y had reached  distressed levels
before the D ecember F OMC meeting , sank further.  To d ate, spillovers to othe r Latin
American financi al markets ha ve appeared quit e limited.   Against the U.S.  dollar, t he
Brazilian real depreciat ed about 2½ percent dur ing the inte rmeeting peri od, and the
Mexican p eso gained ne arly ¾ percen t.  EMBI+  bond sprea ds narrow ed for both
countries.   The Korean won and the Taiwan doll ar deprecia ted somewhat agai nst the
U.S. dollar, but these declines appeared to be related more to  the weakness of the yen
than spillover from Argentina.  Sha re prices in most of emerging A sia moved higher
on net during the  period.
(4) Debt of the nonfe deral sect ors expanded at  an estimate d 7¼ percent
annual  rate in Dece mber, a  bit s lower t han it s aver age pac e over  the pr ecedi ng two
months.  Net debt f inancing by bus inesses moder ated in December,  and, based on
preliminary  data for Janua ry, has re mained light.   Some of the proceeds  from bond
sales have been u sed to pay off loa ns at banks, wh ich continued  to contract into  early
January.  Credi t problems in t he business s ector remaine d concentrat ed among the
weakest firms, and markets continued to  be receptive to other corporate offerings,
while banks, according to the mo st recent senior loan officer survey, have tightened

is showing signs of some slowing .  The recent rise in mortgage rates has damp ed
mortgage refinancing activity, auto sales have dropped b ack, and banks have firmed
terms and sta ndards on  consume r loans som ewhat furthe r as househo ld credit quality
evidently has deteri orated further, mostly among marginal borrowers.   With federal
debt up only slightly,  total nonfinancial debt gr ew at an estimated 6¼ percent annual
rate from September to D ecember.
(5) M2 grew  at a 9 percent an nual rate in D ecember, a bit less th an in
November, and h as moderated considerably further in the early w eeks of January
(Chart 3).3  M2 growth last month, a s has been the  case for a whi le, was suppor ted by
the substantial decline in opportunity costs associated with policy easings and lagg ed
effect s of mortgage re financing a ctivity .  This aggre gate may also ha ve been lif ted by
some investo r preference for stab le-value assets, evidenc ed by outflow s from equ ity
mutual fun ds in Decem ber.  The curre ncy comp onent of the ag gregate was q uite
brisk, l ifted by a pi ckup in demand for U.S.  currency abro ad.  (See box,  “Foreign
Deman d for U.S. Cu rrency,” on pa ge 5.)  With n ominal G DP app arently about flat in
the fourth qu arter, M2 velo city is estimated to h ave fallen at an an nual rate of 9
percent.  Over the four quarters of 2001, it declined 7½  percent, the largest four-

Policy Alternat ives
(6) The staff ha s read the i ncoming data as i ndicating s tronger-t han-
expected econ omic perfor mance in th e quarters surro unding yea r-end, consistent w ith
a recovery s tarting ea rly this  year.  Even s o, the lev el of real  GDP at the end of the
forecast period is little changed, as growth after this quarter has been lowered a tou ch
on the assessment that Congress and the Administrati on will be unable to strike a deal
on substanti al fisc al stimulus , in contra st to the pac kage assumed in r ecent
Greenbo oks.  The stance o f monetary p olicy is assumed  to remain u nchanged  until
late this year, and then, as the economic expansion becom es more assured, to firm
enough to bring the federal funds rate to 3 p ercent by late next year.  Bond yields,
however, are  projected t o remain around rece nt trading r anges rathe r than moving
higher as the  upturn takes hol d, refl ecting a sl ower pace of monetar y policy ti ghtening
than now incorporated into financial markets ; equity prices t rend higher with nominal
income beginning at about midyear; and the foreign exc hange value of the dollar
essentia lly moves si deways.  Agains t this fi nancial back drop, output gr owth climbs
above that of its p otential after mid year, lifted by a resum ption of expa nsion in
business investment.  The unem ployment rate, after plateauing at 6 percent this year,
begins to edg e lower.  The slac k in resource u se helps bring a bout a nota ble decline in
the rate of inflation in core consumer prices, measured o n either a CPI or PC E basis,
over the next two years.
(7) At the end of the Gre enbook forecas t period in t he fourth quart er of
2003, the e conomy is sti ll seen as  operating wit h unused resource s and infla tion
appears pois ed to drift  lower.  But wit h the linger ing effec ts of the c apital ove rhang
dissipating, fiscal policy p roviding stim ulus on net, an d the real federal fu nds rate
remaining on the l ow side of sta ff esti mates of it s equilibr ium value, agg regate demand
is expanding at a faster pace than potential output.  To exam ine longer-term strategies
8
for monetary policy as these dynam ic imbalances play out, three scenarios were
created with th e aid of the FR B/US m odel.  In the baselin e, the Greenb ook forecast is
extended through 2006 by making several judgmental adjustments t o the model that
preserve t he central  features  of the sta ff outlook.   In particul ar, trend mult ifactor
productivit y is assumed t o climb steadi ly at a li ttle over  1 percent per  year, whic h,
combined with a m odest pickup in capital deepening from  its current pace, implies
potential GDP is expanding at a 3½ percent rate by mid-decade.   The effective natural
rate of  unemployment  remains c lose to  5¼ percent –the st aff’s curre nt long- run
estimat e.  The uni fied f ederal  budget is  project ed to ret urn to sur plus af ter 200 3, but
growing o utlays and sche duled tax cu ts restrain the rise in fed eral saving relative to
GDP.  In the baseline, the demand for U.S. exports  is bolstered by a 3 percent  annual
depreciation of the dollar , as well as the gradual  recovery of the world economy, so as
to cap  the cu rrent a ccoun t defici t as a pe rcent o f GD P at a li ttle ov er 5 pe rcent.  
(8) The baseline  strate gy is designed to hold core PCE inflation at
1 percent,  about the rat e prevaili ng as the Greenbook pr ojection c loses.   With the
unemplo yment rate o nly modes tly above its natu ral rate and the g rowth in ag gregate
demand  above trend , policy makers m ight choose to  raise the nom inal funds rate to
4 percent to elevate the real rate to its equilibrium level of 3 percent, as depicted by 
the solid l ine in Chart 4.   As a result,  the economy edges t oward its pote ntial and t he
inflati on rate remains  near its l ong-run goal of  1 percent.   Two alternati ve simulati ons
apply a standard Taylor rule to examine how sensit ive these paths are t o the Federal
Reserve’s  objective s for infl ation.
(9) In the price stability  case (the dotted lin e), policy tightens su fficiently to
point  the e conomy  towar d an i nflation rate of ½ pe rcent as me asured by c ore PCE
price s, or about z ero af ter taking  accoun t of t he bia s in t his mea sure o f inflation.  To
achieve thi s result,  policy fi rms more quickly t han in the base line and then k eeps the

funds rate on a  slight i ncline thr ough mid-2005.  As i n the baseli ne, the
unemployment rate moves  up to around 6 perce nt but, unli ke the base c ase, it  holds
there through 2003 before drop ping slowly.  Even this aggressive pursuit of price
stability does not produce a funds rate profile as steeply sloped as currently emb edded
in market pr ices, supporting th e view that m arket participants  are building in
consid erably  strong er agg regate  dema nd tha n in th e staff fo recast.  
(10) In the inflation cus hion  case (the dashed  line), policy is steered to
achieve a l ong-run infl ation goal of  1½ percent, whic h requires t he funds rate  to drop
below 1¼ percent thi s year.  By  2004, however,  the unemployment rat e crosses  below
its natural rate a nd policy firms, with the nominal funds ra te gradually moving above
its baseline path.  Ironically, the policy designed to keep the funds rate the furthest
above its zero n ominal bo und in the lo ng run req uires movin g the nom inal rate
closest t o zero in the sh ort run.
(11) With regard to policy choice at this m eeting, the Committee m ight elect
to leave the federal funds rate target  unchanged at 1¾  percent if it were re asonably
confident that th e more po sitive tone to inco ming data s ignals imm inent econom ic
recovery.   Last year’ s implementati on of monetary and f iscal st imulus should provi de
substanti al support to  spending going f orward.  Indeed,  judging by the g ap of the
actual rea l funds rat e below staf f estimate s of its e quilibrium val ue, the st ance of
monetary p olicy is already qu ite stimulative (C hart 5 and tab le).  The resurgen ce in
consumer confidence and the recovery in stoc k prices over recent months suggest t hat
household outlays will continue to trend  higher.  With that underlying sup port to sales
and w ith tech nolog ical ch ange p rovid ing an  incen tive to  buy n ew cap ital equ ipme nt, a
recovery of business investment may be seen  as only a matter of time.  Under these
conditions,  the Committee may pref er to stand pa t until in coming informati on sheds
additional  light on the p ossible ne ed for a poli cy adjustment .  As the forc es restr aining

aggregate de mand abate, at  some point the Committee  will need to move t he funds
rate up  from  its curr ent low  level to  preve nt exce ssive sti mulu s from  taking  hold. 
Addition al easing now  would raise th e amplitud e of that ultima te policy adjustm ent,
and put a gr eater premiu m on gettin g the timing o f that policy reversal a bout right,
especial ly if aggr egate demand turns  out to be stro nger than anti cipated.   Given the
uncertaint ies of for ecasting,  such fine t uning may run the ri sk of accent uating the
variab ility of a ggreg ate dem and an d asset  prices .  
(12) If the Committee pe rceived subs tantial r emaining downside r isks to t he
economic outlook, it instead might se lect a 25 basis point re duction  in the federal
funds rate t arget to 1½ perce nt.  While some re cent indica tors of capi tal spendi ng
have been encouraging, a sustained revival m ay be viewed as far from assured.  If
investors in stock and corporate bond  markets came to question the lon g-term
outlook for h igh-tech indu stries and the asso ciated trends for e conomy -wide profit
streams and productivity, the resulting down ward adjustment in asset prices wou ld set
back the rec overy of inve stment and consumpti on.  Moreover, s hould the news on
the labor marke t remain bad for  a while longer , consumer att itudes may turn  out to be
more fragile th an they have see med of late.  W hile easing policy a nother notc h would
not apprecia bly reduce t he risks of  such adverse  outcomes, it  would at least  put the
economy on a slightly stronger footi ng should any of them eventuate.  With an
intensif ication of  inflati on unlikely t o pose a threat  in the next c ouple of year s, the
potential  costs of s uch a policy a ction might be s een as small  when compared with the
cumulative shor tfall of  resource uti lization i n the staf f forecas t.  Indeed,  limiting
disinflation at t his point might be welcomed for strategic r easons:  The risks
associat ed with operati ng policy at  very low nominal i nterest r ates might i ncline the
Comm ittee toward slightly higher inflation than in the Greenboo k forecast–as in the 
11
“inflati on cushion” str ategy descr ibed above–in or der to be able  to put in plac e low
real interest rates if need be in the future.
(13) With m arket participants  apparently be lieving that this easin g cycle is
drawing to  a close, they are beg inning to focu s on when  the Com mittee will chan ge its
assessment  of the balanc e of risks .  A majority of  them apparently  believe t hat the
Comm ittee will choose to retain its assessment that the risks are tilted toward
weak ness at this mee ting, presumabl y bec ause policy ma kers’ views of the ec onomy
are thought to e volve gradual ly in most ci rcumstances.   If that,  in fact,  describes  the
Comm ittee’s view, it would retain its statement that the balance of risks is weighted
toward eco nomic w eakness for either p olicy alternative discu ssed above.  H owever, if
the Committee’s outlook has shifted t o the point that it now views the recover y as
sufficientl y assured–either with an unchanged funds rate or  after an additional
¼ percentage point ease at this meeting– it might opt for balanced risks.
(14) Given that fi nancial market s place smal l odds on a reduct ion in the
funds rate target at this meeting, the choice of no change, even with risks w eighted
toward economic weakne ss, would induc e a slight  increase i n money market rate s and
a smaller ri se in bond yiel ds.  Any tendency  for rates  to rise pre sumably would be
amplified by a  shift to a neutral b alance-of-risks statem ent as market p articipants
move up the anticipated po licy tightening and boost its trajectory.  Another ¼
percentage poi nt reduction i n the federa l funds rat e, along wit h a statement t hat the
risks were weighted to the down side, would come as a surprise to m arket participants,
perhaps prompting a sense that the economic outlook was a li ttle weaker than
previously perceived.   As a result, some immediate reduction in long-t erm as well as
short-te rm interest  rates li kely would occur .  The adoption of  balanced ri sks would go
a long way t oward short -circuiting  any downward r evision to expe ctations about
spending, perhaps even to the point w here longer-term yields would rise.

(15) Under the a ssum ption  of an u nchan ged p olicy st ance th roug h mid -year, 
as in the staff f orecast, M2 growth from December to June would step down to a 5½
percent annual rate.  The slowing in M 2 mainly reflects the waning effects of last
year’s e asings.   In addition,  the staf f expects  outflows of c urrency to Europe a nd
Argentina as wel l as the ef fects of  mortgage refi nancings to di minish in coming
months relati ve to December.  Nonet heless,  the associ ated quarter ly average  rate of
expansion of M2 w ould still be well in excess of the 3¾ percent pace of projected
nominal GDP growth, implyi ng a further de cline in ve locity av eraging 2¼ percen t
over the first half of the year.
(16) Overall deb t of domestic n onfinancial secto rs is projected to g row at a
4¼ percent pace f rom December to June, r eflecti ng an edging off  of federal  debt and
a 5¼ percent rise in nonfederal debt.  In view o f the attractive level of longer-term
rates , corpor ations  are expe cted to c ontinue t o tap the  bond market s in vol ume, but
with external financing needs  picking up as the inventory runoff  draws closer to an
end, short-term business credit is projected to begin expand ing over the spring.  In
the household s ector, bor rowing probably wil l remain concent rated in mortga ge
markets.  Co nsumer cre dit could level o ut, particularly as au to sales tail off.
