Board of Governors of the Federal Reserv e System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensiv e digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES
Recent D evelopm ents
(1) Market participants had largel y anticipated the Committee’s deci sion at
its Januar y meeting to l eave the ta rget feder al funds rat e unchanged and to re tain the
statement t hat the bala nce of ris ks was weighted t oward economic weaknes s, but the
accompanying pres s releas e was apparentl y read as sugg esting opti mism about the
course of the economy go ing forward.  In response, most interest rates edged higher
that day.  Ov er the interme eting period, da ta on spend ing and ou tput have com e in
considerably above market expectations an d a fiscal stimulus package has been
enacted, leading inves tors to see the economy as like ly rebounding more rapidly than
had b een th ough t, a view  reinfo rced b y the C hairm an’s m oneta ry pol icy testi mon y. 
As a result,  market parti cipants se em confident th at there wil l be no change in t he
intended fe deral funds r ate at thi s meeting, a nd a majority re portedly expe ct the
Comm ittee to shift its risk assessment to balance.  Judging by fed funds futures rates,
market participants now place si gnificant odds on policy ti ghtening at the May
meeting and have boosted their anticipat ed path for policy going forward as much as
55 basis poi nts (Chart 1) .  Eurodollar f utures rat es suggest  that a cumulati ve tighteni ng
of about 300 basis points is expected by late next year.
(2)  Implied forward r ates on Treas ury securit ies at in termediate-  and
longer-te rm maturities  also have ri sen appreci ably over the  intermeeti ng period.1  In

2  The 50 basis point  rise in i nflation c ompensation deri ved from the indexed debt
market probably over states  the change in i nflation e xpectaions.   In mid-February,  the

light of incom ing data on sp ending and  activity suggesting  more im petus to aggre gate
demand , increases in equity w ealth, and high er estimates of un derlying prod uctivity
growth.  In addi tion, inf lation expe ctations may  have moved up in respons e to the
more rapid  rebound in  econom ic activity now fo reseen, as well as the r ecent runup  in
oil price s, altho ugh the evidenc e is mixed.   A survey measure of  household infl ation
expectations has only edged up, but i nflation compensation as measured by the sprea d
of nominal over indexed yields has risen sub stantially.2  On balance, nominal  yields on
Treas ury co upon  securi ties ha ve risen  35 to 5 5 basis  point s since t he Jan uary m eeting . 
Yields on high-grade corporate bonds have generall y risen a bit less , and broad
measures o f speculative-grad e yields have actu ally fallen as the imp roved econ omic
outlook led investors to trim their assessment of credit risk.  The better outlook also
has boosted equi ty prices , with broad i ndexes up about 4- 1/2 percent s ince the
January meeting (Chart 2).  The telecom munications and techno logy sectors have 
performed less well, however, as concerns abou t accounting practices and lowered
earnings forecasts have weighed on the bo nd and equity prices of some firm s in these
industries.  Accounting worries also contributed  to the effective exclusion of a few
more firms from the commercial paper market and widened risk spreads in that
mark et.

With the exception of Japan, monetary policy i n other industrial countrie s has
remained on hold, while interest r ates on long-term government securitie s have
moved up about 20 to 30 bas is points,  and stock pri ces have moved hig her.  The

will be reached around the end of March, before the arrival of  April tax payments.  In that
event, the Treasury would have to take special  measures to try to avoid delays i n scheduled
payments.  Treasury market participant s do not appear to be anticipati ng payment difficulties

negligible in January, rose to about $13-1/2 billion in Feb ruary, a slightly faster pace
than in the seco nd half of last year (C hart 3).  Muc h of the increase o wed to a rise in
net bond issuance, as businesses continued to sub stitute bonds for shorter-term
sourc es of fu nds.  O ffering s by inv estme nt-gra de firm s have  been p articu larly h eavy. 
By contrast, heig htened con cerns about a ccounting p ractices and the re cord default

issuance in that m arket in Febru ary was at the lo w end of its rece nt range.  In early
March, net b ond issuanc e appears to h ave remaine d robust, with  the bulk again
coming from investment-grade firms.  Commercial and industrial  loans at banks

(6) M2 growth reb ounded to a 6-1/2 percent an nual rate in February, after
running at just a 2-1/4 percent pace  in January.  Nonetheless,  money growth thus far
this year  has slowed consi derably fr om its robust pac e over the la st two months of
2001, likely owin g in part to the w aning influen ce of prior declin es in opportu nity
costs on holdi ng M2 assets.   Retail money market  mutual funds, whi ch accounted f or

Policy Alternat ives
(7) Stronger-than-expected economic data and the pas sage of a fiscal
stimulus  package  have le d the st aff to  mark up its  foreca st for  spending  and output
appreciably since the J anuary meeting.  As in the prior foreca st, the staf f assumes that
the fed eral fu nds ra te will b e held  at 1-3/ 4 perc ent thr ough  the firs t half o f this ye ar. 
Thereafter , however, t he funds rate  rises soon er and more stee ply, rea ching 4 percent
by the end of 2003.  While the assumed tightening i s less pronounced than that
currently built into market rates, longer-term Treasury yields and m ortgage rates are
anticipated to remain close to current levels through 200 3.  Corporate yields are
projected to edge lower as the imp roving economic ou tlook leads investors to mark
down their assessments of credit risk, and stock prices are projected to rise a bit faster
than nominal GDP.  These c hanges in domesti c financi al conditi ons, along wit h the
firming  in underl ying demand , are pr ojecte d to be cons istent  with growt h of output
above that of th e staff’s upwardly re vised estimate o f potential GD P growth .  By late
2003, the output gap is about eli minated and the unemployment rate falls to about 5-
1/4 percent,  around staff  estimates  of the NAIRU.  In the int erim, though,  the
persistent output gap contri butes to a slight downtrend in core PCE inflati on.  Total
PCE inflation, responding largely to high er oil prices, rises a bit over the forecast
period.
(8) Unless the Committee’s sense of the outl ook differs materiall y from that
embodied in the st aff fore cast, i t might be incl ined to keep the fe deral fund s rate
unchanged  at this meeting.  In the staff forecast, holding the funds rate steady for a
little while longer i s consist ent with both unemploy ment and core inf lation edgi ng
lower.  Even if the Committee suspects that  policy may have to be firmed sooner than
assumed in the s taff for ecast,  the uncertai nty regardi ng the streng th of the re bound
may ma ke it particularly adv antageo us to awa it further r eadings o n the  econ omy

before act ing, espe cially g iven the la ck of evident  pressures  on resources.   If so,
selecti on of the balan ce-of-r isks sta tement to accompany  an unchanged targe t funds
rate may be the  primary focus  of the Committee’ s discuss ion at this  meeting.  (A box
on the next p age discusses the b alance of risks in m ore detail.)  This blu ebook will
consider the three possibilities for the balance-of-risk statement given an unchanged
funds rate a nd touch upon two policy  choices bra cketing an unc hanged policy–e asing
or tightening 1 /4 percentag e point.
(9) If the Committee remains mostly concerned about the possibil ity that
the recover y could falt er, it mig ht wish to hold the f unds rate unc hanged and
retain a  balance of risks w eighted toward  economic w eakness .  The recent spate
of stronger -than-expe cted economic news  might stem important ly from a reve rsal of
the tempo rary depressing  effects of the terrorist attack s on aggrega te demand , with
the pace of gr owth going forward qui te possibl y weaker.  I n the staf f forecas t, the
abatement o f the inventory ru noff accounts fo r a considerab le portion of th e strength
in GDP  growth ov er the next few q uarters, implying  that growth  of final deman d is
noticeably  below that of GDP.  The f orecasted pi ckup in final  demand over the
second half of 2 002 and in 20 03 depend s importan tly on continu ed solid grow th in
consumer spending–whi ch leaves t he personal s aving rate a t a level  that is qui te low
by the standar ds of all but the p ast few years–an d a turnarou nd in investm ent that is
far from ass ured.  Concerns a bout the stre ngth of fina l demand, couple d with the
possibili ty that the  economy might be able  to operate at  higher leve ls of labor
utilization with out engend ering inflation p ressures than assu med in the sta ff forecast,
might be viewed as provid ing the Comm ittee with ample scope to pursue a m ore
accomm odative policy.  In deed, such con cerns may b e sufficiently worriso me to
justify easing 1/ 4 percenta ge point at this meet ing (presumably  while retai ning the
balance of risks ti lted toward economic weakness).  In this  view, failing t o ease may

The Balance-of-Risks  Statement
As noted in the main text, market participants are split on the balance of risks that the
Committee will announce at the conclusion of this meeting, with a majority expecting a shift
to a neutral risk assessment.  In principle, the Committee’s decision on the balance of risks
would seem to depend on three determinations.  First, it must weigh the implications for the
appropriate setting of the policy rate of likely  deviations from its twin goals of maximum
employment and price stability.  Second, the Committee must assess the distribution of
outcomes around that forecast–that is, the skew of potential shocks.  And lastly, the
Committee would seem to need to form some assessment of the length of the time period over
which this balance should be weighed–that is, how far ahead does the “foreseeable  future”
stretch.  
All three judgments are inherently subjective and hard to disentang le, but, given the
brief history of announcing a risk assessment, investors will be particularly  keen to interpret
whatever the Comm ittee decides at t he this meeting–c ombined with how poli cy actuall y
evolves over subsequent meetings–as a precedent regarding the  time span covered by the
foreseeable f uture.  By d esign, the bala nce-of-risk sta tement was not supp osed necessaril y to
predict policy  action at the next me eting, so it would s eem that the horizon  of the foreseea ble
future extends past May.  Just how far past May the forese eable future extends is an open
question, the answer to which depends on the Committee’s confidence in its ability to predict
events increasingly distant in time.  That, in turn, should be related to the Committee’s
assessment of the imbalances that exist at the start of the forecast period and the distribution
of potential shock s.  At a time when unc ertainties about t he outlook may  be especially
elevated, the fo reseeable futu re might be meas ured in quarters , not years.
ultimately indu ce inflation that is view ed as too low  to provide an  adequate cu shion to
set negati ve real fe deral funds r ates if  needed in the f uture to counte ract the ef fects of
adverse demand shock s.
(10) By contrast,  the Committee might be i nclined to hold the fu nds rate
unchanged a nd adopt a n eutral  balance  of ri sks at this meeting if it is more
confident that the growth of output will  be around its potential and sees  inflation as
contained.  The especiall y adverse outcomes for the economy that the Committee was
worried ab out at the prio r few meeting s may seem  much less likely n ow.  Indeed , in
recent weeks, data surpri ses have nearly all  run on the upside, supporting the view that
- 9 -
risks are no  long er skewe d tow ard e cono mic we akne ss.  Unli ke the ou tlook at  the time
of the January meeting, the Greenb ook forecast shows less overall slack in resource
utilization, little upd rift in the unem ployment r ate, and less of a do wntrend to
inflation.  To be sure,  the real funds rate i s unsustainably low, and if  the nominal
funds rate we re held at its curren t level for very long , inflation would  begin to
intensify.  But as discu ssed in the box  on the balan ce of risks, heightene d uncertainty
about the outl ook could have the  effect  of making the hori zon over which the
Committee defines  the forese eable futur e relati vely limit ed.  And in that s horter run,
at lea st acc ording t o the st aff forecas t, inf lation is li kely t o drift  lower and o utput
growth w ill be a tad above  that of its potential.
(11) If the Committee reads the strength of r ecent economic indicators as
signaling  that last ing economic growth a bove potentia l is a dis tinct li kelihood, i t might
wish to hold the funds rate u nchanged  and mo ve the balance of risks tow ard
heightened inflation pressures .   With the eco nomy seem ing to have reg ained its
footing, the C ommittee  might view  a balance tow ard inflation as esp ecially appropr iate
in light of the un sustainably low  level of the real fund s rate, the recent up tick in
measures of i nflation e xpectati ons based on Treas ury inflat ion-indexed s ecuritie s, and
the possibility that sharp increases in oil prices could feed through to prices and w ages
more gen erally.  Indeed, the su rprising resilience ex hibited by the e conomy  of late
raises t he possibil ity that s pending may snap back  more rapidly t han in the
Greenbook.  If the Committee were especially conce rned that, if it  did not move
promptly to begi n to restore  the funds rat e to more sustai nable level s, infl ation
pressures cou ld build over  time to the po int that they wo uld be difficult to c ontain, it
might even choose to implement a quarter-p oint increa se in the targ et funds ra te
along with a bal ance of ris ks weighted t oward inflat ion pressure s.  In part icular,  the
apparent turna round of demand in the hi gh-tech se ctor, fa vorable news on
- 10 -
productivit y, accel erator ef fects st emming from the recent  pickup in output  growth,
and the busines s tax incen tives inc luded in the f iscal st imulus package migh t be
imparting a n even mo re sizable imp etus to investm ent spending  than in the staff
foreca st.  For ces suc h as thes e help t o explai n why some meas ures of  the equi librium
real funds r ate have been b oosted as much as a  half a perc entage point  over the
intermeeting period (Chart 4).   Such an increase in estimates of  the equilibrium real
funds rate im plies that just ma intaining the sam e degree of po licy stimulus w ould
require increasin g the nom inal funds rate tar get.
(12) Market participants widely expect  the funds rate to be held constant  at
this meeting an d increasingly ar e looking for th e FOM C to charac terize the risks to
the outlook a s symmetric.  R etention of a ba lance of risks weig hted toward  econom ic
weak ness w ould s urpri se ma ny, and  wou ld pro bably  pull in terest r ates m odest ly low er. 
The outcome for equit y prices an d exchange rat es is more dif ficult t o gauge and no
doubt would be infl uenced by the wordi ng of the announcement :  If inve stors see  the
FOM C’s statement as evidencing its desire to see output return to po tential more
quickly tha n they had previ ously anti cipated,  they might mark up the ir outlook f or
profits,  and stock pri ces could acc ordingly ri se.  Any init ial decli ne in the doll ar might
be offset to some degree by the as sociated increased at tractiveness of  U.S. financial
assets.  But there is also a chance that investors could read the FOM C’s policy
statement as p resaging a we aker econom y than they had  anticipated.  Th is possibility
would be even more li kely if t he Committee caught marke t partici pants unawares by
easing 1/4 percentage point.  In either event, stock prices could fall and that decline,
in turn, would tend to reinforce the initial decline in interest rates.
(13) The selecti on of a neutral  balance of r isks would be i n line with t he
expectati ons of the majori ty of market pa rticipant s, but some inv estors would s till be
surprised by  the decisi on.  The effe cts in fi nancial market s in this c ase would like ly be

rather muted but m ight encompass a small increase in interest rates, a drop in stock
prices, and a small rise in the foreign exchange value of the dollar.
(14) Market participants do not expect a m ove to a balance of risks toward
inflati on pressures  at this meet ing, much les s one accompanied by  a quarter-poi nt
increase in the target funds rate.  As a result, either choice would push interest rates
higher acros s the term st ructure while  equities  could come under heavy  selling
pressure.  The ex tent of the ma rket reaction cou ld be sizable an d, of course, wo uld
depend importantly on  the wording of the annou ncement and the associated m arket
perceptions ab out the future  course of policy .  In particular, the reac tion in mark ets
could be atte nuated if t he wording of the a nnouncement emphasized t hat the
Committee vi ewed its elf as  merely unwi nding some of  the ins urance i t had tak en out
late last year at a time of unusual uncertainty, and that it intended to wait thereafter,
rather than e mbark on a path that  would promptly real ign the real  interest  rate to a
more no rmal level.
(15) M2 growth is projected to slow this year to a pace  somewhat above that
of nominal GD P.  The waning stimulus from  past policy easings, considerably wider
opportunity co sts lat er this ye ar accompanying t he assumed tight ening of poli cy, and
more attractive returns on equities and other m arket instruments are key factors
contributing to the anticipated deceleration of M 2.  Next year, the further assumed
tightening of p olicy and the asso ciated widen ing of oppo rtunity costs pu lls M2 grow th
well below that of nomina l GDP, implying a significant increase in velocity.
(16) Total domestic  nonfinancia l debt is e xpected to adv ance at about a  5-1/2
percent pace  over the fi rst two quarte rs of this  year.  Give n the strengt h of readings
from recent e conomic in dicators, the pace o f business borro wing is projec ted to
increase over coming months, spurred by a pickup in i nvestment spending and an
associat ed widening of t he financi ng gap.  The improvement  in the economy shoul d,

over time, contribute to improved cred it quality in the business sector and narrower
risk spreads.  Borrowing by households is  likely to slow somewhat in line with an
anticipated ebbing of the demand  for autos and new hom es.  Federal debt is projected
to advance at about a 3-1/2 percent rat e over the first hal f of this year and at a -
somewh at faster rate in the latter h alf of the year.  Nex t year, federal debt gr owth
drops off  sharply  with the  economic r ecovery  returni ng the fe deral bud get to s urplus
by the second quarter of the year.
