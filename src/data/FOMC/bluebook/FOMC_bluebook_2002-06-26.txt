MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES
Recent D evelopmen ts1
(1) The FOMC’s decision on M ay 7 to leave the intended  federal funds rate
at 1-3/4 percent  and to retain a neu tral balance-of-r isks statement  came as no
surprise to financial markets.2  Treasury yiel ds fell a few basis  points that aft ernoon,
though, as mark et participant s focused on the l anguage in the  accompanying
statement indi cating that th e Committee r emained uncert ain about the ext ent and
timing of the strengthening in final demand.  The mixed bag of subseq uent economic
data releases–alon g with height ened geopolitic al tensions, warn ings of terror ism, and
further revelations of question able corporate accountin g practices–led investors  to
mark down their assessmen t of the strength of the economic  expansion and to
withdraw somewhat from taking on risk.  As a result, marke t participants now see
monetary policy on hold into the fall, with no change in the balance-of-risks
assessment, and have  lowered the expected path  of the intended funds rate  about
1/2 percentage point next year (chart 1).  Judged by options on int erest rates futures,
uncertainty about that path, at least at longer horizons, has incre ased appreciably.
(2) Consistent wit h the downward rev ision to policy e xpectations, yie lds on
short- and intermediate-term Treasury notes have fallen about 25 to 3 5 basis points
since the May FOMC meeting.  Given that the yield on ten-year indexed Treasur y

3  Other factors reportedly influencing Treasury yields included purchases by investors of
longer-term Treasuries to temper the effects on their portfolios of the shortening durations of
mortgage backed securi ties as interest r ates fell.  In additio n, some states and m unicipalities
purchased Treasur ies in the market to d efease their securi ties they have refund ed in advance. 
Normally, those entities would purchase nonmarketable issues from the Treasury, but with the debt
ceiling currently  binding, the Treasu ry has suspended such d irect sales.debt has not moved  much, the decli ne in the comparab le nominal yield i mplies that
inflation compensation has dropped by the same amount.  In contrast, survey
measures of expe cted inflation ha ve held steady.  I n part, the drop i n yields on
nominal Treasury securities may have owed to heavier safe-haven flows that were
prompted by heightened geopolitical tensions and a downdraft in equity prices.3 
While earnings reports for the first quarter most ly matched analysts’ expectations,
guidance about  corporate sales  prospects tende d to be downbeat, on  balance, helping
to push major equity indexes 3-3/4 to 7-1/4 percent  lower over the intermeeting
period (chart 2).  In fixed-income markets, spreads over comparable Treasur y
instruments have fallen so mewhat for most investment-gra de corporate bonds but
have risen substantially for high-yield bonds, consistent with an apparently increased
tendency for inv estors to shy awa y from riskier  securities.  I ndeed, risk spread s for
some highly leveraged firms rose to levels that induced them t o postpone issues. 
Flows into equity and junk bond mutual funds, which had been strong earl ier this
year, dried up in  May and early June , while flows int o other types of domestic bond
funds picked up.
(3) On balance over t he intermeeti ng period, the t rade-weighted v alue of the
dollar against ot her major curr encies has decline d about 3-1/2 per cent (chart 2) .  The
dollar’s slide was broad-based as indications of softer U.S. growth and a scaling back
of expectations regarding near-term Federal Reserve tight ening apparently lessened
the attractiv eness of dollar ass ets and prompted c oncerns that capi tal inflows from

abroad may no longe r increase fast e nough to suppor t the dollar aga inst the backdro p
of a growing U.S. current account deficit.  The decline against  the yen was interrupted
several times b y foreign exchan ge interventi on by Japanese aut horities in lat e May and
early June.  Government bond yields were essentially unchanged in Japan and have
declined 15 to 20  basis points in Eu rope, somewhat l ess than the drop i n the
comparable U.S. Treasury yield.  Foreign equity markets have m oved substantially
lower, with the largest declines in Europe.  The losses in Japan were smalle r amid
scattered indications of improved economic performance there.  U.S. monetary
authorities did not interven e in foreign exchange markets , 
      
 .
(4) On balance, the dol lar’s value agai nst the curren cies of other im portant
trading partners has risen 1 percent over the intermeeting  period.  Markets reacted
noticeably duri ng the interme eting period t o growing conce rns about econom ic and
political problems in several Latin American countries.  The dollar’s decline ag ainst
major currencies and scal ed-back expectations  for U.S. growth seemed to spill  over to
Mexican markets, with the peso dropping about 4 percent against the dollar and share
prices falling  almost 12 perce nt.  Uncertaint ies ahead of Brazil ’s autumn elec tions and
worries about its large volume of debt maturing  soon caused spreads on Brazil’s
sovereign bonds over comparable Treasuries to widen more than 600 basis points. 
The Argentine peso fell 12-1/2 percent further against t he dollar, as efforts to stabilize
the Argentine  economy remaine d stalled.  In con trast, curre ncies of several emerging
Asian economies–including South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, and Indonesia–firmed
against the dollar amid further indications that first-half grow th there has been robust
and that recovery may be extending beyond technology-based export sectors.

(5) Nonfinancial businesses have borrowed relatively little on net in the past
two months.  Net bond issuance in May was very weak, commercial paper continued
to run off, and bank loans were up only a little (chart 3).  Equi ty issuance, however,
held up well last  month, as some fi rms sold shares i n an attempt to a ssuage investo r
concerns about leverage even in the face of falling stock prices.  Households expanded
their consumer debt at a moderate rate in April, and data from commer cial banks
suggest simi lar growth in Ma y.  Home mortga ge debt, which ex panded at a 10 perce nt
annual rate in the first quarter, appears to be on track for another strong showing in
the current quarter as housing activi ty remains robust and mortgage ref inancings, with
the associated cashing-out of equity, continue to be brisk.  O n a seasonally adjusted
basis, Treasury debt held  by the public increased in  May.  The statutory debt ceil ing,
which applies to gross public debt (not seasonally adjusted), hit its $ 5.95 trillion limit
in mid-May and conti nues to bind.  Tax collections thi s month have been r unning
about as expected, and it still appears that Treasury will not have the means t o get past
the end of this mo nth without r esorting to ex traordinary acco unting devices  absent an
increase in the debt ceiling (see the box on the next page).  
(6) M2 grew at a 5 percent annual rate on average over April and May   
(chart 3).  Tax effects, arisin g from buildu ps and runoffs in l iquid component s that
differ from those embedde d in the seasonal facto rs, significantly boosted  May growth
after having depressed April growth by a similar amount.  The re duced attractiveness
of stocks, as reflected in a halt of equity mutual fund infl ows last month, probably also
contributed to rapid M2 growth in May, particularly in retail m oney market funds. 
The opportunit y cost of holding  M2 has been relati vely stable over  the first half o f the
year, and its velocity appears to have leveled out as well after its sharp drop in 2001 .

The Treasury  Debt Ceiling
Since May 16, 2002, the Treasury has used accounting devices to stay under the $5.95 trillion
statutory debt ceiling.  Over this period, it has disinvested as much as $30 billion from
government trust  funds (chart).  T he Treasury has pub licly identified $80 bil lion of such
potential accounting devices it would be willing to employ.  If it holds to that stated amount, the
issue may come to a head o n June 28th, when a large amount of interest must be credited to
various federal trust funds in the form of nonmarketable Treasury securities that are subject to
the debt ceiling.
Tax collections in Ju ne have not provided mu ch extra cash to allow th e Treasury to pay down
existing debt and create enough room under the ceiling to issue debt to meet its month-end
obligations.  As a res ult, the announcement  of the June 26th auction of two-year no tes, which
normally would have been m ade on June 19th, has been postponed u ntil the Treasury h as
assurance of borrowing authority.  However, market  prices do not suggest that participants are
particularly concerne d about the crisis,  presumably because th ey expect the Congress  to resolve
the issue before th e Treasury defaults  (even to a government t rust fund) or th e Treasury to take
extreme measures t o stave off default.   
In previous debt- ceiling emergencies, th e political wrangling has  typically gone down to th e wire. 
As the deadline approaches, the Treasury may look for ways to disinvest the trust funds further,
or the Congress may g rant a temporary exemp tion from the ceilin g for certain debt is sues.

Policy Alt ernative s
(7) Although mark et participant s apparently view ed economic data ov er the
intermeeting  period as having a  weakish cast, th e staff outlook  had not been as
buoyant to begi n with, and the br oad contour of th e forecast has cha nged little.  F rom
the staff’s perspective, th e incoming nonfinancia l data have generally ali gned with
expectations–wi th the notable ex ception of disappo inting indicat ors of consumpt ion
in the current quarter.  Moreover, with equ ity prices lower and businesses apparently
less confident, t he staff has edged  down the project ed growth of re al GDP this year
and next.  As a consequence, the assumed inception of policy tightening has been
postponed until  early next year.   The staff now assu mes the funds ra te will reach 3- 1/2
percent by the fourth quarter of next year, Treasury cou pon yields will move higher
from their new lower level as th e tightening occurs, but quality sprea ds on corporate
bonds will narrow as the economy’s expansion continues.  Stock prices are anticipated
to hold this year  near their cur rent level–abou t 6 percent belo w the assumptio n in the
May Greenbook–and trend up next year.  As the appetite of global investors to shift
portfolios to do llar assets is as sumed to fail t o keep pace with t he burgeoning  current
account deficit, the foreign exchange value of the dollar is seen as moving  lower
through the end of next year, in contrast to the fairly flat pat h previously envisioned. 
Against this backdrop, forecasted growth in real GDP over the next  six quarters
outpaces that of  its potential,  closing much of  the current ou tput gap by the  end of
next year.  The tendency for economic slack to put downward pressure on core
inflation in the interim, however, is about offset by an uptur n in import prices, so core
PCE inflation holds just be low 1-1/2 percent this yea r and next.
(8) At the end of the  Greenbook forec ast period in the  fourth quart er of
2003, the level of output is nea r its potential, the real fund s rate is close to its
equilibrium  level, and pressu res on inflation in either direc tion are muted.   But in the
7
staff view, for ces are in play th at will requi re further pol icy action to mai ntain the
economy along a su stainable path bey ond the Greenbook  horizon.  A depre ciating
dollar will steer more foreign demand toward U.S. markets, and domestic fir ms will
find capital spend ing to be increa singly attract ive over time, raising the eq uilibrium re al
federal funds rat e and necessitati ng a policy respo nse.  Against t his backdrop,
alternative scenarios we re created using the FRB/US mod el to explore challenges to
monetary policy.  In all cas es, the model was solved  to find a path for the funds  rate
beginning next  quarter that  minimizes squ ared deviations of  output from i ts potential
and the inflation rate from a long-term target, with a sm all penalty applied to changes
in the funds rate.  Moreover, as in similar exercises in recent Bluebooks, t he policy
maker is assume d to operate wit h complete knowl edge of the forc es shaping the
extended outlook —that is, to have  “perfect fore sight.”  Those  forces shaping t he
outlook extende d through 2007  include the com plete struct ure of the econo my as
approximated by FRB/US and judgmental assumptions made to preserve a few key
features of th e staff outlook  beyond the Green book horizon.  In  particular, po tential
output is expe cted to grow at  a rate of 3-1/4 pe rcent after 20 03, and the
unemployment r ate consistent w ith stable infla tion is anticipa ted to hold at 5-1 /4
percent.  The dec line in the real exchange rate is  assumed to stee pen modestly to 3
percent per year by 2004 an d stay at that pace thereafte r, and growth in foreign
economic activi ty is assumed to  climb to 3-3/4 pe rcent, thereby  allowing the cu rrent
account to stabilize relative to nominal GDP.  Growth in federal expenditures is
assumed to be restrained sufficiently to prevent further  deterioration in the unified
deficit past 200 3.  (In general , the extension o f the Greenbook f orecast for thi s round
differs little from what was sh own in the May Bluebook. )  
(9) The dashed line in t he upper panel of chart 4 plots th e staff assumpt ion
for the nominal federal funds rate over the Greenbook baseline, which ends in 2003.

The solid line show s the path for th e funds rate in t he “perfect for esight” baseli ne
chosen by a policy make r with a long-run inflation targe t for PCE inflation of about  
1-1/4 percent and  an equal distast e for output de viating from i ts potential and
inflation deviating from its target.  The perfect fore sight path for the funds rate rises
sooner but slightly more gradually than assumed in the Gr eenbook.  With this increase
in the nominal fu nds rate, the re al funds rate ri ses along with i ts gradually i ncreasing
equilibrium  value.  By 2006,  the real rate r eaches its long- run equilibr ium level of
3-1/4 percent.  D uring the tr ansition, spendin g expands a touch  faster than pote ntial
output, putt ing the unempl oyment rate on a g radual descent t o its natural r ate.  The
economic slack ov er that period m ore than counte rs the inflatio nary impetus of  the
assumed deprecia tion of the dollar , keeping core P CE inflation near  its assumed 1-1 /4
percent goal.  
(10) The volatility  of stock prices over the inter meeting perio d highlights t he
possibility that investors  may become more sensitive to  taking on risk, perhaps lea ding 
to lower stock p rices than in the  Greenbook and adver se effects on spe nding.  In the
alternative scenario provided in Chart 5, an assumed increase in the equity  risk
premium produces a  stock market pr ice decline  of about 20 perc ent over the
second half of the year (the same as  in the alternat ive stock marke t scenario in the
Greenbook).  In  response to the c ontraction in ag gregate demand  associated with that
decline in wealth, the perfect foresight policy maker responds relativel y quickly,
trimming the  nominal funds rat e about 1/2 perce ntage point by t he end of the year
(the dotted lin e).  As a result , both unemploym ent and inflation  track the basel ine
closely.  Because of the pe rsistent weakness in equity pri ces, the nominal funds ra te
remains more than 1/2 percentage point below the baseline level throug h 2000,
eventually bringing the real ra te to its new lower equilibrium level o f about
2-3/4 percent.

(11) These policy paths are o bviously quite sensitive to the a ssumed long-
term goal for inflation, a topic addressed in the alternative inflation targets scenario
of Chart 6.  The dashed and dotted line, respectively, consider the paths preferred by a
policy maker with an infla tion target 1/2 percentage poi nt lower and 1/2 percenta ge
point higher t han the baseline g oal of 1-1/4 perce nt.  Given the as sumed equal
weights on devi ations of outpu t and inflation, a  perfect-fores ight policy mak er wishing
to enforce an inflation goal of 3/4 percent would raise the federal funds rate q uickly
and hold it at a higher level than in the baseline so as to maintain more slack in
resource markets over the next five years.  An inflation goal of 1-3/4 percent entails
putting the nominal funds rate below 1-1/2 percent for the re st of this year. 
(12) The staff forecast suggests that the current  degree of policy
accommodation must be mai ntained for a time to support re asonably vigorous
economic expansion th at prevents inflation fal ling further from already low le vels.  If
the Committe e agrees with t his assessment an d finds the associa ted outcome for
inflation to be acceptab le, it could elect to leave its  policy stance unchanged  and
retain a statement of balanced risks .  Given the cur rent degree of slack in the
economy, the Com mittee can wait  until it sees m ore evidence that  sustained stro ng
growth is in train before beginning to remove the cu rrent degree of monetary policy
ease.  The Committee might hold  rates unchanged, even if it s aw a distinct possibility
of a stronger outlook for economic activity than in the Greenbook, i f it also viewed
the inflation r ate as quite u nlikely to move  higher for a con siderable time o r to be
already at a level members viewed as on the low side of a working definition of price
stability.  Whil e market parti cipants seem a bit  more glum abou t the economic ou tlook
of late, they pr obably had outsiz ed expectations t o begin with, pe rhaps inclining  the
Committee to view the recent deterioration in mark et prices as a move toward more

and the increased s kittishness of i nvestors in U.S.  financial market s as indicating t hat
at the current funds rate the risks to the Comm ittee’s objective of sustainable

long-run price  stability, sug gesting that  it opt to state that the risks were weighted
toward economic  weakness while keeping its po licy stance on hold .  Capital
spending has yet to show convincing evidence of a sustained upturn, and recent news
on retail sales an d consumer confi dence has been on th e soft side.  Inde ed, the
Committee may  sense an increased  risk of a severe  deterioration in consumer and
business confide nce that could st em from terror ist attacks or i nternational con flicts or
from further news of accounting and corporate governance irre gularities.  In that same
vein, the Commi ttee may be conce rned that subst antially weaker  equity price s may be
in the cards, perhaps along the lines of the scenario discussed previously.  Appreciably
softer real growth than in the Greenbook would augment any t endency for the core
inflation rate to decline, a tendency that would be accentuated if the Comm ittee
believed that the natural rate of unemployment was significantl y lower than estimated
by the staff.  If the Committee views these argu ments as applying with considerable
force, it may want to consider easing policy 1/4 percentage point at this meeting. 
Market participants, however, do not put any weight on this possibility, r aising the risk
of an outsized, potentially counterproductive,  reaction to su ch a move.
(14) Although the economic expansion has slowed in the second quarter, it
has not stalled, and final demand appears to be growing at about the rate the staff
expected at the M ay meeting.  Pr oduction and empl oyment are advanc ing, and the
incoming data hav e pointed to a nasc ent turnaroun d in business spen ding on capital
11
equipment and software, whi ch the Committee viewed as ess ential for a robust 
recovery.  As a consequence, with both monetary and fiscal policy quite  stimulative,
the Committe e may see reasonabl y strong grow th in the second ha lf of the year as
now somewhat more assured and view its concerns about the foreseeable futu re
beginning to center more on the long-run inflation risks i nherent in its policy stance. 
Under these circumstances, the Committee could choose to keep policy unchanged
but move to a  balance of risks tilted toward inflation .  Although the Committee
may not see an immediate po licy adjustment as needed , it might anticipate having to
start tightening its policy stanc e fairly soon and may wa nt to convey that sense to
market participants.  The current real federal funds rate is m uch lower than staff
estimates of it s equilibriu m value (as disc ussed in the box, “Estimates of the
Equilibrium  Federal Funds Rat e,” on the next p age).  At some point, the preva iling
real funds rate would set in motion an excessively robust economic boom t hat, if
sustained, woul d lead inevitably to higher infla tion.  If the C ommittee thou ght the
foreign exchange value of the dollar was now firmly on a downward trend, price
pressures might be expected to mount as higher import  prices give domestic
producers the “ pricing power”  they have thus f ar been lacking.   In such a case, t he
Committee might conclude that an immediate tig htening of 25 basis points is
warranted to start heading off inflationary momentum.
(15) Markets currently expect the Committee to refr ain from altering its policy
stance or its ass essment of the r isks at this mee ting, so confir ming this expec tation
would leave lit tle imprint on financial prices , absent a surpri se in the accompan ying
announcement.  Choice of risks weighted mainly toward economic weakness would
cause market par ticipants to pu sh back in time t he advent of polic y tightening and
possibly lower the slope of the subsequent trajectory of the f unds rate as well. 
Conversely, a sw itch to a preponde rance of risks we ighted toward h eightened infla tion

Estimates of the Equili brium Real Federal  Funds Rate
In this Bluebook we  have made two sets of c hanges to our estim ates of the equilibr ium real
federal funds rate t hat are displayed in Char t 7.   
First, the technique used to extract the persistent components of the FRB/US model errors
employed in the calculation of the FRB/US estimates has been changed.  In past Bluebooks, the
model errors were split into temporary and more persistent components using a centered moving
average (in the case of t he estimate based on h istorical data and the  staff forecast)  and a one-sided
moving average (in the case of the estimate based on historical data only).  Going forward, a more
sophisticated detrending algorithm (a Hodrick-Prescott filter) will be used in both cases, with a
two-sided version  of the algorithm appl ied in the first cas e and a one-sided vers ion in the second. 
As shown in the table, in the current quarter the new estimates are close to those reported in the
May Bluebook, which wer e calculated using the ol d methodology.  However , the new series diff er
more substantially from the old at times in the past.
Second, we have added two new measures of the equilibrium real funds rate to the table and
chart:  an FRB/US meas ure that employs the  two-sided detrendi ng algorithm but does  not make
use of the staff f orecast, and a measur e based on the statis tical filter that rel ies on a one-sided
version of the filt er and the historical  data alone.
As a general rule, the on e-sided measures t hat employ only the his torical data should p rovide a
better sense of ho w the equilibrium fun ds rate in a given quart er might have been seen i n “real-
time,” that is, based  on information thr ough that quarter.  (The measures are not truly real-time
estimates because, for example, the parameters of the models are based on all of the data, and the
final revised data are  used rather than th e data available at the time. )  By contrast, the t wo-sided
measures use later data to improve the estimates of the equilibrium funds rate earlier in the
period, with the two- sided measures tha t employ the staff f orecast also allowing  the staff’s
assessment of the outlook to influence those estimates.  Because the one-sided measures are not
revised in light of l ater observations , they provide noisie r estimates of the  equilibrium funds  rate. 
Also note that the chart plots the estimate of the equilibrium real rate derived from indexed debt
yields separately fr om the range of estim ates produced by macro economic models.  
pressures wou ld advance the mar ket’s expectat ion of the timin g of policy firm ing and
possibly increas e the extent of a nticipated addit ional tighteni ng as well.  The r eaction
of the expected funds rate path would, of course, be even more pronounced if policy
were to be eased or tightened 25 basis points.  Short-term inter est rates could closely
follow the mark ets’ revisions t o the path of the e xpected funds rat e, and the

immediate respo nse of stock pric es seems likely to be in the opposi te direction.  T he
reaction of bond yields is more difficult to predict.  In the past few years, bond rates
have often tended to move in the same direction as stock prices following policy
announcements (as discussed on the box on the next page).  If financial markets r evert
to the previous average pattern, however, bond rates would move in t he same
direction as the funds rate expectations, though by less. 
(16) Domestic nonfinancial sector debt is projected on the Greenbook policy
assumptions to expand at around a 6  percent rate ov er the last thr ee quarters of  the
year, faster than the anticipated growth in nominal GDP over that per iod.  After a
surge this qu arter, federal debt growth is  seen as slowing s harply in the sec ond half of
the year, thoug h remaining posi tive in associat ion with continu ed federal defici ts.  The
average growt h of nonfederal debt  should rise at ab out a 5-3/4 perce nt rate over th e
last three quarters of the year.  Ove r this interval, household  borrowing is likely to
slacken compared w ith the first q uarter, pulle d down by an anticipa ted lower pace of
home mortgage debt growth.  Busine ss borrowing, in contrast, i s expected to pick up
from its subdued first-quarter perf ormance, as increases i n capital spending outrun
internal funds.  With both banks and investors in financial markets being rather
selective in adv ancing funds to b usinesses, the s taff foresees cr edit restrict iveness for
lower-quality borrowers as providing only a small degree of rest raint to business
spending.  Altho ugh some deter ioration for mar ginal household b orrowers also has
occurred, consumption is not likely to be appreciably restrained by credit conditions. 
The staff is projecting M2 growth of 5 percent from May to Decem ber of this year,
faster than its 4 percent rate of expansion from December to May.  With short -term
interest rates little changed,  growth of M2 for the four quarters of 20 02 is expected to
be 5 percent, about in line with the expansion in nominal GDP.

In principle, bond yi elds and stock prices  should incorporat e expectations of the p ath for policy
rates–appropriatel y discounted and a djusted for risk–that w ill prevail over th eir lifetimes.  Beca use
the federal funds r ate tends to move rela tively smoothly thr ough time, market par ticipants would
typically react to any cur rent policy surpri se by extrapolating s ome of that change into  the future. 
Thus, a Committee decision that was not fully expected tends to (but does not always) shift the
path of expected future short rates in the same direction.
In that case, and holdi ng all else equal, it
would be expected that a surprisingly tight
(loose) policy decision would raise (lower)
longer–term yields.  Because investors
should discount expected corporate
earnings by that same expected path of
short rates, su rprisingly tight ( loose) policy
should lower (rais e) equity prices.  Over
time, this should p roduce a negative
correlation between bo nd yields and stock
prices in periods wh en important news
about monetary policy is being revealed.  In
fact, as shown in Table 1, bond yields and
stock prices moved in the opposite
direction–the upper left and lower right cells of the table–on 64 percent of the days that the
Committee met or acted  between meetings fro m 1988 to 1998.
But all else does not seem to have been equal since 1998.  On days of FOMC meetings or
intermeeting policy act ions from 1999 to t he present, the expect ed opposite reaction  of stock
prices and bond yields  occurred less than 5 0 percent of the time.  (Table 2).  One reaso n that stock
prices and bond yields sometimes move in the same direction seems to stem from the effect of
changes in near-term policy expectations on
investors’ outlook for earnings growth.  For
example, near-term policy expectations
dropped sharply fo llowing the unexpected
policy easing on January 3, 2001, and the
move seemed to buoy the confidence of
equity market invest ors.  Stock prices r allied
sharply that day, and policy expectations
farther in the fut ure moved up signifi cantly
as well, perhaps on a view that higher equity
prices would bolster future aggregate
spending though a “wealth effect.”  On net,
the increase in policy ex pectations at longer
horizons outweighed the drop in near-term
policy expectations r esulting in an
appreciable rise in bo nd yields that day.
