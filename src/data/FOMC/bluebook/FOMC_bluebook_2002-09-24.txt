 
Prefatory Note  
 
 
The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from  the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserv e System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensiv e digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a re daction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redact ed passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    
 
                                                
 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and we re not checked or corrected by staff.

FOMC’s announcem ent following the A ugust m eeting of no chang e in the target
funds  rate and  a shift in the  assessm ent of th e balan ce of risks to ward  econo mic
weakness.  O ver the remaind er of that day, near-term interest rate futures edged
higher  as thos e expec ting i mminent eas e were di sappoi nted,  but rat es se veral  months

weaker e conomic pros pects .  Spi rits were l ifted brie fly by the une ventf ul pass ing of
the August 14  deadlin e for the r ecertification  of corp orate fina ncial statem ents; equ ity
markets rallied for sev eral days, p ulling Treasury yields up in tow.  Since t hen,
however, the so fter tone to  incom ing da ta on p rodu ction an d em ploym ent,
heightened tensions o ver Iraq, and a gloom ier assessment of the path for bu siness

On balanc e over th e interm eeting p eriod, the  expecte d path  of the fed eral fund s rate

of an easing at  the August meeting and statements by Federal  Reserve offi cials that

than th at of its liabilities.  O ver the in terme eting pe riod, Fa nnie M ae’s share p rice fell
10.3 perce nt compared with a 2.7 percent  decline i n that of Freddie Mac, which had
announced a rough balance between asse ts an d liabilities. recent surv eys of  market pa rticipant s have i ndicat ed that  most anti cipat e the
Com mittee will retain a balance of risks toward eco nom ic weakness.  Futures rates
suggest that investors think it likely that the Federal Reserve w ill respond to weaker
economic outcomes with additional easing at so me point in the next few months. 
Moreover,  the f utures  curve be yond midyear  2003 droppe d 15 to 45  basis  points  and

(2) In keeping w ith the revisions to policy expectations, short-term Treasu ry
yields were about u nchanged  to up slightly while interm ediate- and long-term T reasury
yields shed 3 5 to 40 ba sis points .  The de cline in l onger- term Trea sury y ields
reportedly was am plified by hedging dem ands from  mortgag e-backed securities
inves tors.  Those inv estor s appar ently purchas ed longe r-term Treas uries  to off set the
shorten ing in th e dura tion of th eir portfo lios stem ming from  the jum p in pr epaym ents
on m ortgage-backed securities that accom panied the surge in m ortgage refinancings.2 
At the ten-year m aturity, yields on Treasury indexed securities fell a bit less than those
on their nom inal counterparts–perh aps because indexed  securities did not experience
increased  hedg ing de mands to th e sam e degre e–bu t also pro bably su ggestive o f a
slight dec line in inflatio n com pensatio n and  a dow nward revisio n to eco nom ic

speculati ve-grade bonds narrowed a litt le over the i ntermeeting peri od and, very recentl y,
liquidity in thi s market  segment r eport edly has  improved somewhat.   These re cent
stirrings i n the speculat ive-grade sec tor may have been occasioned by the sizabl e net

Market pressures on major broker-deal ers may be a factor hinderi ng further

about othe r indus trial count ries, particularly Germany and Ja pan, r egardi ng the
momentum of economic re covery  that wer e even more  pronounced t han in t he
United States.   The dollar general ly moved in narrow ranges against  individual
currencies, ending the period ab out unch anged against m ost, but it appreciated almost
2-1/4 percent on  balance against the yen.  Policy rates in foreign industrial coun tries
were left unchang ed, and mo st foreign long-term go vernmen t bond yields declined

(5) Borrowing by businesses appears  to have remained weak (Chart 4),  as
external f inanci ng needs a pparent ly are very  low thi s quart er.  In rec ent week s, the
improved  tone in the corpo rate bond m arket has prom pted a m odest step-up in gross

of the  slack in re source  use.  In thi s envi ronment,  the st aff has re tained the
assumpti on of an unch anged st ance of  monetary pol icy through 2003 , followed by
some unwinding of  monetary e ase in 2004.   As the ec onomy picks  up stea m and the
onset of policy tightening app roaches, Treasury yields edge high er, and corporate risk

(9) If the Committee vi ews the do wnside r isk of  economic wea kness  to be

Comm ittee may cons ider a  sust ained e xpansi on of aggr egate  demand as by no means
assured, particularly given continuing q uestions about b usinesses’ willingness to hire
and sp end an d the frag ility of key em erging  mar kets.  M arket pa rticipants a ppear  to
share  such qual ms in that  equity  price s are  still qui te vol atile and lower  on balanc e, and
corpo rate risk spr eads rem ain w ide.  At th is junctu re, with fina ncial m arkets qu ite
skittish, t he Co mmittee may find it more d ifficult than usual to predict the market
response if policy action does no t match prevailing exp ectations.  Futures market
quotes indicate that investors on av erage place just a small proba bility on a policy
easing at t his meet ing, although they a ppear t o expect  at le ast a quarte r point  cut i n the
funds r ate by  early next  year.   A policy de cision of no c hange in  the f unds rat e and a
balanc e of risks still po inting to ward  econo mic w eakness th erefore w ould prob ably
repre sent on ly a minor  disappo intment  to market  parti cipant s and induc e just  a slight
backup in interest rates at shorter m aturities and perhaps a m odest decline in stock
price s.  As a lways,  the wordi ng of the  announcement wi ll prove import ant in shapi ng

(10) The C ommittee m ay wish  to shift to a  balance d ass essment o f risks if
it believes that the likeli hood o f a slide back into econom ic weakness, which seem ed
more palpable when market stress es mounted in the runup to the August meeting, has
receded.  Two important hurdles–the August 14 deadli ne for cert ifying financial
statements a nd the f irst anni versary of  September 1 1–pass ed unevent fully, pe rhaps
sugge sting tha t the C ommittee’s assess ment of the u ncertain ties surro unding its
forecast  has narrowed.  In additi on, the Comm ittee may be concerned that a zero real
funds  rate will so on p ose the r isk of im parting  excessive stim ulus if the  forces cu rrently
holding do wn the equi librium real  funds r ate lift more quickl y than i s impli cit in the
staff forecast, perhaps along the lines of t he alternative simulation in th e Greenbook. 
With some m easures of the equity prem ium at their highest levels since the early 1990s,
the Committee  may see goo d odds that  the st ock market  and, he nce, aggrega te demand
will rebound more t han proje cted i n the Green book, e speci ally give n the appa rent

“Policymak er Perfect Foresight” Str ategies
The up dated perfect foresight exercises have been renam ed “policym aker

assumed to  know th e structure of the econom y and the shocks tha t will occur over
the projection period, private agents in these F RB/US sim ulations form
expecta tions u sing a sm all vector a utoreg ression m odel.  Th e fund s rate path  is
chosen  to m inimize the su m of square s of the d eviation  of une mploym ent from  its

2004, potenti al output is proj ected to grow at about the s ame rate project ed for 2004

at a 3 percent real rate, and the federal budget b alance gradually imp roves.

Comm ittee chos e to ea se, parti cular ly if the  move were 50 ba sis points .  The e xtent  of
the rall y would also depend on whether market partici pants inter pret the act ion as an
earlier-than-expected comp letion of the easing already built into m arket prices or as a
harbing er of f urther  easings.  That ass essment , of course , will depend i mportantl y on

(13) Under the Greenbook forecast,  with a flat  funds rate,  total nonfi nancial
debt and its nonfeder al component are both projecte d to continue to grow at about a 6
percent pace over  the next couple of  quarters.   The composition of nonfederal
borro wing  shifts som ewhat, how ever, as bu siness bo rrow ing reco vers w hile ho useho ld

making cred it available to  busin esses with out su bstantially c onstrictin g the o verall
prospects for capital spending.  In the ho usehold sector, a mo deration in auto sales
should contribute to some lessening in the growth of consumer credit.  Home
mortgage de bt is expect ed to dec elerate from its r apid re cent gr owth rat es, reflecting
moderati on in housi ng acti vity and the c ompleti on of the  curren t wave of  mortgage

four quarters of this year, M2 is pro jected to grow 6-3/ 4 percent, considerably faster

than n ominal G DP, owing  largely to th e lagged  effects of last year ’s decline in sh ort-
term interest rates and opp ortunity costs, as well as mortgage refinancing s.
