 
Prefatory Note  
 
 
The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from  the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserv e System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensiv e digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a re daction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redact ed passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    
 
                                                
 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and we re not checked or corrected by staff.

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES
PREPARED FOR THE FEDERAL OPEN MARKET COMMITTEE
BY THE STAFF OF THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM

1  The federal funds rate averaged close to 1-3/4 percent over the intermeeting period.  With
currency growth quite low relative to historical trends, the Desk made no outright purchases during
the period.  Other market factors generally added reserves, and the Desk responded by reducing the
outstanding volume of long-term System RPs from $11 billion to $6 billion.Stric tly C onfidential (F.R .) October 31, 2002

“heightened g eopolitical risks” in the anno unce ment  and t he indication of two
dissenting votes favoring an easing o f monetary po licy led markets to expect a low er
trajector y for t he poli cy rat e.  A subs equent r ally in equi ty pri ces tended to buoy
market interest r ates and  policy ex pectation s.  In recent d ays, how ever, gene rally
weaker-than-anticipated economic data and press reports suggesting that the FOMC

Market Liq uidity
Recent evidence on market perce ptions of the hea lth of major fi nancial
instit utions and the funct ioning of fi nancial markets  is mixed.   Credit  default s wap

remain el evate d on balanc e.  Cre dit swap sprea ds for  finance compani es have  shot
up as m uch as 500 basis points on net. 
Increased perceptions of, and aversion  toward, risk have prob ably been
associat ed with some withdrawal from market making, as reports  suggest that
liquidity in many se gments of  the f ixed- income market s has de teriorate d sinc e the
late sum mer.  In  the Tr easury m arket, prem iums for on -the-run  securities o ver their
off-the-run counterparts have risen since m idyear, with the relatively larger increase
for the ten-year note probab ly related in part to its usefulness in hedging m ortgage-

insufficient to make much headway against Japan’s deep structural problems.

2 Banks have been r eport ing weaker  loan demand and a t ightening of  standards and

respon dents to ra nk su pply a nd d emand fa ctors as rea sons fo r the ver y substan tial decline in
C&I loans so far  this year .  Weaker business funding needs by credit worthy borrowers was
the top re ason b y a w ide m argin. mon ths, the chief reason being reduced sp ending on  plant and equ ipment.  Bu siness

(8) Over th e intermeeting period , incoming data p rovided further
disapp ointm ents on  prod uction  and em ploym ent and , on the w hole, seem ed to
sugges t some f laggi ng in the  growth of c onsumption when c ompared with t he
September Greenbook.  Accordingly, the s taff has  revised down its f orecast f or real
output gro wth over the n ext few quarters, but not to the p oint where co ntinued
economic e xpansi on seems t o be in s erious  doubt.   Real GDP growth, af ter running
at a projected rate of only 1 percent in the cu rrent quarter, is expected to strengthen
gradually over most of  the forecas t period,  although it remains bel ow that of potential
grow th un til the secon d half o f next year .  As a resu lt, the civilian u nemploym ent rate
is expected to mo ve up to 6-1/4 p ercent early next year before edging low er after
mid-2003.  W ith econom ic slack persisting, core infl ation is projected to drift lower,
bringi ng the annua l rise in core PCE pric es down to ab out 1-1 /4 perce nt in 20 03 and
2004.  T his foreca st assum es that the  Committee keeps p olicy stead y, as opp osed to
the mod est tightening built in toward th e end of the forecast period in the S eptember
Greenb ook.  An  unchang ed funds rate is assumed  to hold yields on lon g-term
Treasury securities near current levels, while rates on corporate issues should in time
decline so mew hat as a g radua l strength ening  of the eco nom ic expan sion resu lts in
some u nwindin g of credit concerns.  Equ ity prices rise moderately over the forecast
period t o keep ri sk-adjust ed ret urns i n line  with thos e on fi xed-i ncome secur ities.  The

level t hat is sl ightly hi gher than project ed in the las t Greenbook.

3 The  jagged  movements in the  real fede ral fund s rate in the c hart ow e to sw ings in

PCE prices.   Core PCE prices were  reduced s ignificantly in the  third quart er of 2001 by t he
imputed p ayment by in surers of  claim s related to th e destruc tion of th e World T rade C enter.

Comm ittee may be pa rticular ly dra wn to this  polic y approac h if i t views the cur rent
degree of slack in resource use to b e less pronounced  than does the staff and hen ce
sees less scope for further disinflation than is embod ied in the staff forecast.   In
addition, while estimates of the equ ilibrium real short-term interest rate have m oved
lower over the past  year–and some have been revise d down ex post–the actual real
rate has been below  the lower bo und of the ran ge of estimates since mid-2001.  E ven
with the narrowing in that  gap projected f or the current quart er, the Com mittee may
be of t he vie w that s ufficient  monetary s timulus  is already i n the pi peline give n the
lags in th e transm ission of p olicy (cha rt 5).3  Indeed, the Committee may believe t hat
the G reenb ook fo recast, wh ich is som ewhat below  the con sensus o utlook , is overly
pessimisti c regarding prospect s for aggregat e demand.  As noted in the box on page 8,
while the staff projection for the next two yea rs shows low er inflation and a higher
unem ploymen t rate than in the prior few G reenbooks, the recent realizations of those
variables  have moved the other way.  In the c urrent quarter,  higher energy pri ces have
boosted inflation and g ains in estimates of househo ld employm ent have been
assoc iated with a l ower unemployment  rate than was t hought li kely a couple  of
mon ths ago.  The C omm ittee might be inclined to keep p olicy on hold if it put m ore
weight on th ose outcom es than on forecast revisions.

Revis ions  to the Outl ook Sinc e the  August Meet ing
Econo mic forecasts by the staff and mo st market participants have turn ed
gloomier  sinc e mid-August whe n the Committee  moved its  asse ssment of  the
balance of risks to one tilted toward eco nom ic weakness.  Som e of that forecast
revision owes to chan ges in the assessment of aggrega te deman d and oth er
fundamental forces and some to changes in ma rket rates and p rices.  To g et some
sense  of the  relative contri bution of  the f ormer,  a simula tion was  run usin g the
FRB/US m odel i n which the  August Greenbook was  revised to i ncorpora te th e
current assum ption of a flat federal funds rate (as opposed to th e higher A ugust
Greenb ook path).  The d otted lines in chart 6 depict this adjusted A ugust
simulation,  while the soli d lines depic t the most recent  Greenbook.
In the sta ff’s current asse ssmen t, real GD P gro wth is like ly to take lo nger to
retur n to it s poten tial than was t he cas e in August,  implyi ng that  the unemploy ment
rate run s highe r.  W ith a large r cum ulative b uildu p of reso urce slack , disinflation is
more p ronoun ced.  How ever, near-term developm ents have led the staff to mark
the unem ploymen t rate down an d inflation up for this year.
Mechanical  polic y rule s relying on c urrent  and lagg ed obser vations of
macroeconomic  data,  such as  the Tayl or rule , would t ake tho se nea r-term revi sions
as re asons t o rais e the pol icy rate.  By contr ast, mechanica l poli cy rul es re lying on
current and project ed variables , such as t he policymaker perf ect fore sight path t hat
is discuss ed below,  would put more emphas is on t he revi sions  to the  forec ast and

ease polic y at t his meet ing.  Accordingl y, a decis ion to l eave pol icy unc hanged,
presumably accompanied by the asses sment expected in the market s that the r isks
remain tilted toward  econom ic weakness, is likely to have a noticeable effect on asset
prices.  Interest rates could move up , particularly at the short end of the yield curve,
and equit y pric es would pr obably f all.  The bal ance- of-risks statement,  the wordi ng of
the rest of the announ cement, and the vo te tally will influence the odds investors

(11)   The Comm ittee ins tead might  ease p olicy 25  basi s poin ts if, in view
of signs of s lowing ag gregat e demand growth,  it now se es the  likely deg ree of
economic slack seve ral quarters  ahead with an unchanged stance of poli cy as
unaccept able,  espec ially given subdued r eadings  on infl ation expect ations and the
prosp ects for furth er disinflatio n.  The  incom ing da ta sugg est that spe nding  by bo th
househol ds and busi nesse s has be en weaker  than exp ected by the s taff, and the
Committee mig ht be co ncern ed that e cono mic g rowth cou ld turn  out slo wer th an in
the Greenbook outlook.  Also, whether f inancial c onditions will  prove to be as
support ive of  growth as  the st aff expect s is open to ques tion:   Credit s preads  and
liquidity condit ions i n segments  of the  corpora te bond marke t have de teriorate d, and
banks have co ntinued to firm term s and standards o n business loans, albeit in fewer
num bers than earlier in the year.  With som e large financial intermediaries themselves
encou ntering  mar ket resistanc e, their ability to  mak e ma rkets and  interm ediate cre dit
flows co uld b e crim ped to  a greater d egree th an antic ipated b y the staff, pote ntially
contributing to som e diminu tion in market liquid ity and credit availability.  In these
circumstances , the Committee may be lieve the  time has  come to bols ter spending by
easing policy.  Presumab ly, the Comm ittee would see a relatively small policy
adjustment o f 25 basis points as not likely to put the risks back into balance,
particularly in view of the apparen t weakening in the eco nom ic outlook since the last
meeting. 
(12) The Com mittee might view the s igns of sof tening growth that have
becom e appa rent ov er the pa st six wee ks as espec ially troub ling in asso ciation w ith
historica lly low inf lation and nominal i ntere st rates as well  as the  signi ficant downsi de
risks already e nvisi oned by the  Comm ittee since August.   In thes e circumstance s, the
Comm ittee might wi sh to move ag gress ively to sho re up aggr egate  demand through a
50-ba sis-point eas ing of policy  and m ight see little co st to do ing so in  terms  of a
10
need to r evers e cours e anyt ime soon.   Indeed,  the pol icymake r perf ect foresi ght
simulat ions t hat employ  a judgmenta l extension of the  Greenbook as sumptions  and
are depicted in chart 7 entail a substantial near-term easing  of mon etary policy, even
with an i nflation t arget  as low as  1 perce nt.  Moreover,  while t hose si mulation s by
definition assume no unc ertainty in for ecasting e conomic re lationships , the
Committee mig ht be co ncern ed that w eaker sp endin g pro pensities o r mo re favora ble
inflation-o utpu t tradeo ffs could w ell result in still low er inflation  rates.  The  possib ility
of signif icant furt her disinf lation might be vie wed as unduly heightening the ri sk that
the ability to  lower  real interest r ates cou ld be co nstraine d by th e zero b ound to
nom inal rates.  Although the C omm ittee might be reluctant to claim th at a 25-basis-
point e asing w ould balanc e the risks to  the eco nom y and in flation, a m ove of 5 0 basis
points  might more pl ausibl y do so.
(13) A 25-basis-po int redu ction in  the targe t federal fun ds rate, cou pled w ith
a statem ent that th e risks rem ained w eighted  towa rd eco nom ic weak ness, likely w ould
provide a sm all boost to financial markets, lowering yields and  raising stock prices,
although the magni tude of  these  influences  could be a ffected c onside rably  by the
content of the Committee’s  statement.   If the s tatement emphasized a need to combat
weakness in aggreg ate deman d as the primary ration ale for the policy action, the effect
on equit y pric es coul d be muted and t hat on l onger- term int erest rates ac centua ted,
but if the statement suggested tha t the principal motivation w as to provide greater
assuran ce of a satisfacto ry expa nsion, ga ins in eq uity price s and d eclines in co rpora te
bond yiel ds coul d be more noti ceabl e while  the net  effects on Treasur y bond yie lds
might be sm aller.  A 50-basis-point cut in the funds rate target, even if accomp anied
by a statem ent that th e risks to th e outlo ok w ere seen a s balanc ed, likely w ould
prompt si zable dr ops in y ields acr oss t he maturi ty and c redit  spect rums, a lthough t he
fall in long-term Treasury yields cou ld be limited if equity ma rkets rally strongly.

The perfect foresight simulations extend the key assumptions of the staff outlook (other than the path for monetary policy) thr ough 2008:
      ●      potential output grows at about 3-1/2 percent per year
      ●      the relative price of oil stabilizes at its 2005 level
      ●      the exchange value of dollar measured in real terms falls at a 3 percent clip
      ●      modest growth in federal expenditures allows an improvement in the federal budget balance
1.  The real federal funds rate is calculated as the quarterly average nominal funds rate minus the four-quarter lagged core PC E inflation
rate as a proxy for inflation expectations.

(14) Under the Greenb ook forecast, the growth rate o f nonfederal debt edg es

investm ent turn s up o nly grad ually.  W ith econ omic grow th increa sing on ly tentatively
and investment projects seen as entailing considerable risks, the availability and terms
of credit facing businesses are expected to chang e little in the near term, although they
shou ld ease so mew hat later in  the pro jection p eriod a s it becom es mo re eviden t to
market particip ants that th e expan sion is ga ining tra ction.  Fed eral bor rowing is likely
to be re duced somewhat  in the  curren t quart er by t he Treas ury’s unexpec tedly high

quarter as the effects o f deficits again  fully show  throu gh.  O n balan ce, dom estic

M2 growth is also expected  to mod erate in coming m onths from  its pace over the past
