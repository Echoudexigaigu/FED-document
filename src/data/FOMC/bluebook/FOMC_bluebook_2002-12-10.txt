The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from  the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserv e System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensiv e digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a re daction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redact ed passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    
 
                                                
 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and we re not checked or corrected by staff.

Recent D evelo pments
(1) Market par ticipant s had expe cted t hat the  FOM C would cut it s target for
the f ederal  funds r ate 25  basis  points  at the  November meetin g and ret ain a ba lance  of
risks toward wea kness, and then ease policy again early next year.  Co nsequently, they
were caught off guard by t he immediate 50 basis point  cut and the shif t to an
assessment of  balanc ed ris ks.  Treasur y coupon yi elds initially fell following the
anno uncem ent bu t rebou nded  later that after noon, as investo rs focused  on th e shift
to balance and low ered the odds o n prono unced econ omic w eakness, in part
reflecting the pol icy action.  Over most  of the  intermeeti ng peri od, incoming
economic da ta and e arning s news f urther  reas sured mark et par ticipant s about t he
outloo k.  In recen t days, ho weve r, mark ets absor bed m ore m ixed eco nom ic repor ts
and dow nbeat inform ation on pro spects in the tech sector.  Still,  interest-rate futures
suggest that investors continue to exp ect monetary p olicy tightening to com mence
next year and, indeed, now  anticipate a higher path for the federal fund s rate after
midyear than  they did before the last meeting (ch art 1).  Options on  those futures
indicate le ss near-term  uncer tainty ab out th e path fo r rates and , in particu lar, little
likelihood of  outcomes r equiri ng very  low funds r ates next s pring ( see the box on

(2) Reflecti ng the upward shift in t he expected path f or the target  federal
funds rate after the midd le of next year, yields on two-year Treasury no tes climbed
about 15 ba sis points  over t he int ermeeti ng peri od.  Yie lds on t en-ye ar nominal  and
inflat ion-indexed Treasuri es both were about unchanged on balance, s uggesting that
long-term in flation expectations were stable.  The  imp roved ou tlook for the economy
and earnings initially buoyed stock  prices, but equity markets sold off over the p ast
few days in response to th e mixed read ings on the econ omy an d signs of a less
buoyant p ath for earnings than p reviously expected.  On  balance, broad stock price
indexe s edged  dow n ½ to 1 per cent, wh ile the N asdaq  was u p abo ut ½  percen t,
implying that earnings-price ratios remained fairly high relative to real interest rates. 
Expected s tock marke t vola tility implie d by opti ons pri ces was  about uncha nged on
net.  Spreads of  yields on i nvestment-grade i ssues over Treas uries decl ined 10 to 40
basis po ints, while th ose on  specula tive-grad e bon ds dro pped  more than  100 ba sis
points  (char t 2).  Nonethele ss, credi t spre ads st ayed wide , proba bly re flecting concer ns
that defa ult rates co uld rem ain high  and re covery r ates low  for som e time.  O verall
market conditions generally improved in the weeks prior to the November FOMC
meeting a nd have i mproved somewhat f urther  over t he int ermeeti ng peri od, hel ping
to keep year-end pressures subdued thus far (see the box on page 4). 
(3) The dol lar’s value ag ainst maj or foreign cur rencies strengthene d about
3/4 percent on a trade- weighted basis over  the intermeeti ng period.  In the e uro area,
signs of increasing econom ic weakness prom pted the Eu ropean C entral Bank to low er
policy rates 50 basis points today, somew hat mo re than had b een built into ma rket
prices.  For the period as a w hole, yields on long-term go vernmen t debt in the Eu ro
area fell 10 to 15 ba sis point s, stock pr ice inde xes decl ined a li ttle, and t he eur o’s value
against th e dollar w as abo ut un chang ed.  Fina ncial m arkets in Ja pan flu ctuated  main ly
in response to  speculation about fisc al policy measures and banking sector reforms.

System or th e Treasury.The ann ounce ment of  reforms i n late Novembe r omit ted s ome key  deta ils, but
market pa rticipant s judge d that t he ful l plan will  be inade quate t o the t ask.  After t he
announcement,  bank st ock pri ces s taged a  modest re covery  but fi nishe d well down on
the per iod.  Broad inde xes of  Japanes e shar e pric es were  off onl y slightly.  The  Bank
of Japa n indic ated t hat it now would aim at  the upper  end of i ts target  range f or
reserve balances and bega n to imp lement its previously anno unced plan  to purchase
equiti es from banks.   On net, t he doll ar gai ned about 2 -1/2 pe rcent  vers us the y en,
with a sizable  move late in the peri od following comments by Japanese offi cials that
seemed to favor yen  weakness.  Ag ainst an index of the curren cies of our other
important  tradi ng partne rs, the dol lar moved up a  touch ove r the pe riod.   Early i n the
period, pro-ma rket statements by associates of the Brazilian president-elect
contributed to a s ubstantial  narrowing of that country’ s EMB I+ spread, but that  move
was retr aced p artially as m arkets be came jittery abo ut the staffin g of key e cono mic
posts; although stocks rose abo ut 6 percent, the real decli ned 5-1 /2 perce nt agai nst the
dollar.2
(4) With the U.S.  corpora te bond marke t more rec eptive, gross  bond
issuance by nonfinancial firms in November recovered to the fastest p ace since June.

Policy Alternatives
(6) The FO MC’s decision to ease monetary po licy at the Novem ber
meeting, some improvement in financi al market conditi ons on balance, and an
assessm ent that fisca l policy co uld b e som ewhat mo re expa nsiona ry have  led the sta ff
to boost its projection of econo mic activity over the next two  years.  The assumed
funds r ate target  is now 50 ba sis points  lower t han in t he previ ous proj ection and
remains at that level until mid-200 4, when the FO MC begins tightening.  Treasury
bond and  mortgage r ates are ro ughly  flat over th e forecast p eriod, w hile investm ent-
grade corporate yi elds move down considerably as ri sk premiums fall f urther in an
enviro nment of stren gthen ing gro wth.  E quity p rices rise at ab out th e sam e pace as  in
the last Gre enbook,  but fr om an upwardly re vised base.   The exchan ge val ue of t he
dollar, as before, is seen as edging down in th is forecast.  Real GDP  growth, projected
at 3-1/4 perc ent nex t yea r and 4- 1/4 perc ent in 2004,  is up a l ittle more t han 1/4
percentage point from  the last Greenboo k.  The forecast for unem ploymen t has been
revised d own corresp ondingly, with  the rate n ow se en as de clining fro m a h igh of 6
perce nt in t he first three quar ters of next  year t o just  below 5- 1/2 perc ent by t he end
of the forecast period, still above the staff’ s estimate of the NA IRU.  As a
consequen ce of the lessened slack in resource use, prices are predicted to decelerate a
shade le ss than in  the prev ious p rojection , with co re PC E inflatio n exp ected to  drift
down to a 1-1/4 percent rate in 2004. 
(7) Should the  Comm ittee sha re the  staff’s assessment  of the  underly ing
force s shapi ng the ec onomy and be of t he vie w that t he monetary  stimulus in t he
pipeline i s adequate to support s atisfactory economic growth with low infl ation, i t may
want to stand  pat at this meeting on b oth the funds rate target and  the risk
assessment.   Standard r elationshi ps sugge st that, given t he lags  in the  effects of
monetary pol icy, last year’ s eas ings a re still support ing growt h in aggr egate  demand,
8
and N ovem ber’s action , which  moved th e real feder al fund s rate m ore distin ctly into
negative t erritory , creat ed a larger gap bel ow the band of estimated equili brium real
rates ( chart 3).   In view of the st imulus that is a lready in pl ace, t he Com mittee may
wish to  await th e arrival o f mo re inform ation, po ssibly inclu ding th e econ omic
implic ations of a ny mili tary confl ict, before adj usting its  polic y stance.  The
Comm ittee may bel ieve that,  given t he curr ent st ance of  polic y, the low odds but  high
costs of m arked fu rther d isinflation (o r even o utrigh t deflation ) and th e econ omic
weakness  that pr esumably  would att end such a  devel opment roughl y bala nce the
arguably higher o dds but low er costs of increased inflation and an un sustainable pace
of growth.   Thus, t he Committee may be lieve that  retaining t he curr ent degr ee of
policy accommodation would be consistent with an assessment of b alanced risks. 
(8) If the Committee sees a ne ed for additi onal insurance agai nst excess ive
disinflation and econom ic weakness, it may wan t to implem ent a further 25 basis
point  reducti on in its f unds rate targe t at thi s meeting while maintaini ng an
assessm ent of b alanced  risks.  The a vailable ev idence su ggests o nly a sm all increase in
real G DP this qu arter, and  the reco very in G DP grow th from  the cur rent “so ft spot”
is still largely a forecast, so that a mu ch weaker outcome c annot be ruled ou t.  Some
combinatio n of an emic r eal grow th and  a mo re favora ble inflation -outpu t tradeo ff
could ca use the  inflation rate  over t he next  couple of  years  to run not iceably bel ow the
staff projection, potentially constraining the Com mittee’s ability to lower real interest
rates if the need were to arise.  Even abstracting from  uncertainties, the Com mittee
might con cur with the G reenbook’s revised projections for ou tput and resou rce use
under the po licy assum ption o f that foreca st but still reg ard the m to  be un acceptab ly

The perfect foresight simulations extend the key assumptions of the staff outlook (other than the path for monetary policy) thr ough 2008:
      ●      potential output grows at about 3-1/2 percent per year
      ●      the relative price of oil stabilizes at its end of 2004 level
      ●      the exchange value of dollar measured in real terms falls at a 3 percent clip
      ●      federal budget deficit relative to GDP declines gradually

expectati on should not have any appreciabl e effe ct on market prices .  An easing of 25
basis points, however, wou ld surprise investors, and the resulting fall in short-term
interes t rates  could carry over i n part to bond yields.   Stock prices c ould rise as
prospective earnings are discou nted at lower interest rates and, perhaps, as investors
revise up the ir out look f or earn ings.   The value  of the  dolla r might move l ower in l ine
with the reduction  in fixed-income yields.  How ever, if equity markets rally strongly,
these ef fects on bond yields and the dollar could well be reversed.

Review of Debt  and Money Growth in 2002
Declines in lo ng-term  interest rates, w hich b rough t yields to for ty-year low s,
importa ntly shaped pr ivate credi t flows thi s year .  In t he busine ss sector , low i nterest rates on
corporate bon ds helped sustain a brisk p ace of gross bon d issuance through  mid-year,
although the proceeds were l argely used t o refinance exis ting debt.   Subsequently, mixed
readings o n the  stren gth o f the e conomic ex pansion, repo rts of d eficie ncies in co rporate
governance, a worsening of corporat e credit qual ity, and heightened geopolit ical ri sks pushed
risk spre ads sharply hig her and brought issuance t o a virtual hal t.  For the yea r as a whole,
overall busi ness borrowing was quite weak, mainly owing to sagg ing capita l expenditures , an
evaporation of merger and acquisi tion acti vity, a nd an increased reli ance on liquid asset s that
had b een b uilt up p reviou sly. 
Household borr owing, by c ontra st, remained r obust i n 2002.  Credit  flows i n the
residenti al mort gage market  picked up f rom an alre ady bri sk pace as  borrowers  took
advantag e of low mort gage i nterest rates, and as st rong motor ve hicle sales boost ed the
expansion of consumer credit.  Agains t the backdrop of weak tax receipt s and increased
outlays,  the federal  government tapped markets in heavy volume for the firs t time in several
years.  M eanw hile, greater sa fe-hav en de mand fo r liquid a ssets that likely ref lected inv estors’
disenchantm ent with the stock m arket supported the b road m onetary aggregates this year,
although their expan sion slowed, ow ing to the waning  effects of the substantial monetary
policy ea sing of 2 001.
Domestic  Nonfinanci al Sec tor Debt
The aggrega te debt o f dom estic non financ ial sectors ex pand ed 6¾  percen t in 200 2, a
bit fas ter than in 2001.  Spurred by weak tax receipts and an acceler ation in spendi ng, federal
debt grew 7½ percent this year af ter contr acting s lightly in 2001.  The growth of nonfederal
debt,  by contr ast, slowed to a 6½ percent  pace in 2002 f rom 7½ percent l ast year,  owing for
the most part t o a sharp slowdown in business borrowing.
   
Anemic busine ss bor rowing t his ye ar was l argel y attribut able t o weak demand for
credit,  reflect ing depressed capi tal expendit ures and modest increases  in inter nal funds, as
well as the t endency of some firms to draw on liquid asset s—w hich began the year at  high
levels—rather than t o seek external f inancing.  Over the fi rst hal f of the year,  gross is suance
of corp orate bo nds b y non financ ial corpo rations m odera ted som ewhat from  the rapid  clip
set in 20 01, b ut still remain ed brisk .  Firm s used th e proc eeds to re financ e highe r-cost
long-t erm debt at  more att ractive interest rates and t o str engthe n thei r bala nce shee ts by
paying down s hort- term obligat ions s uch as bank l oans and commerci al paper .  Issuance of
bonds by higher-rate d speculati ve-grade fir ms outside the belea guered telec om and energy
sectors also held up reason ably well in the first half.

Both investment-grade and high- yield corporat e bond issuance, however, sl owed
dramaticall y in the second half  of 2002, as investors ’ demand for corporate debt weakened
because of co ncerns a bout the re liability  of fin ancial state ments an d the  quality of c orporate
governance, deteri orating cr edit worthines s, and hist oricall y low recovery rates  on defaulted
bonds in  som e sec tors.  W orrie s abo ut the  possibility o f add itiona l earn ings r estatem ents
diminished after  the SEC’s August 14 deadline for cert ificat ion of financial  statements passed
without  any si gnifi cant ne w revelat ions of  corporat e chica nery.   However, with a  weaker t one
of economic data and heightened geopolit ical ri sks early  in the fal l, spr eads of lower-ti er
investm ent-grad e and  high-y ield issues o ver T reasuries c limbe d to their h ighest leve ls in
more than a decade, evidently r eflect ing both great er expected loss es and some pullback
from risk-taki ng.  Trading conditi ons in the corporat e bond m arket als o deteriorat ed
somewhat during this peri od, with debt is sued by auto manufacturers and thei r finance
subsidiaries especially hard hit at times.  As t he fall progressed, howe ver, mo re upb eat news
about t he economy spar ked a ral ly in equit y pric es and r enewed inves tors’ appet ite for
corporat e debt,  pushing  risk spreads  sharpl y lower and l eading t o a rebound i n bond
issuance.
In the co mmercial pa per m arket, co mpanies p erceive d as ha ving q uestion able
accou nting pr actices ex perien ced sign ificant inv estor resistanc e and  most discon tinued  their
progra ms, w hile othe rs shifted to a lternative fo rms o f financ e in an  effort to stren gthen th eir
balance  sheet s.  In addit ion, c ommercial banks  report ed that  they t ightened st andards a nd
terms o n com mercial pap er back up line s of cred it, citing heighte ned c once rns abo ut possib le
deterioration in the credit quality of issuers and a higher probability of lines being drawn
upon because of potential s trains  in the commercial paper market.  All t old, nonfinancial
commercial pa per out standing decl ined 39 per cent i n 2002, aft er droppi ng almost  a thi rd the
previous year.
The runoff of business l oans at commercial banks that s tarted early las t year
intensified in 2002.  Large  banks repor ted a f urthe r weakening  of demand for C&I loans
over t he cours e of t he year,  mainly owing  to re duced outl ays on capi tal equipment a nd
invent ories  and moribund merger  activity.  These  institutions at tributed t he st riking decli ne
in C&I loans not  only t o the r educed fundi ng needs of  credi twort hy borrower s tha t found
bond financ ing or a  runoff of  liqui d asse ts more a ttractive, but al so to a  reduct ion in t he pool
of credi twort hy borrower s tha t stemmed from a deteri oration in a sset quali ty and a
tight ening of banks’ lending pol icies over the course of t he year.  A signi ficant net  percentage
of banks poi nted t o the pos sibility of fur ther revel ations of acc ounting  problems a s a re ason
for tightening t heir l ending pol icies duri ng the f irst half of t he year.   However, the
proportions of banks t hat ti ghtened lending st andards and terms on C& I loans decli ned
noticeabl y in 2 002.
 
After having surged l ate in 2001, growth in commercial mortgage debt dropped
sharply d uring the  first qu arter o f 2002, as no nresidential co nstru ction  spen ding fell.  D espite
A-3
the cont inued cont raction in out lays on nonresi denti al structures,  commercial mort gage debt
expanded briskly over the re mainder of 2002, reflecti ng in part subst itution for other
corpo rate deb t and su pporting a rob ust issuan ce of co mmercial m ortgage- back ed secu rities. 
Although vacancy rates moved somewh at higher,  delinquency rates  on comm ercial
mortgages remained at his torical ly low levels , and banks firmed standards on commercial real
estate l oans in 2 002, on net.
Expansio n of o verall ho useho ld deb t picked  up in 2 002 to the fastest p ace sinc e 198 9. 
With mortgag e rates at very l ow levels  by hist orica l standards,  new purchase s of homes and
mortg age r efinanci ng act ivity we re elevated throughout  the year , spurring a rap id 11½
percent  advance i n home mortgage debt .  Report edly,  a sig nificant number of  households
that ref inanced home m ortgages t ook the opportunity t o extract equi ty to re pay other debt as
well as to  financ e hom e imp rovem ents and  other ex pend itures.  Still, consu mer credit
expanded at a 4¼  perc ent p ace in  2002, sup ported in  part b y the  auto makers’ cut-r ate
financing incent ives and generous rebat es.  Hefty gr owth of overall household debt offs et
decli nes in t he cost  of debt , on net , to ke ep the hous ehold debt -service bur den near i ts mid-
1980 s peak ov er the year.
Despite the elev ated de bt-service  burd en, ho useho ld balan ce shee ts stayed in
relativ ely go od repair.  Al thou gh th e rate  of p ersonal b ankruptcy fillin gs ha s risen , on n et,
this year and de linque ncy rat es re main high f or subpr ime borrower s, broad measures  of
delinquencies  on home mortgages  and consumer l oans have edg ed down.  The rat io of
househo ld ass ets to d isposable  inco me fell this  year , as stee p los ses in  equity m arkets
outweighed solid gai ns in house prices  and disposable income rose.  Households conti nued
net purchases of equi ty mutual funds through t he spring, des pite t he falli ng and volatile s tock
market.   Further  net dec lines in equi ty pr ices since  then,  however, l ed to enor mous
withdraw als from equ ity mutual funds, w hich eviden tly were partly redirected toward
gove rnment bo nd fu nds.
State and loca l gover nment debt a ccele rated thi s year  from the a lready bris k pace of
2001.  Strong issuance of l ong-term municipal debt for new capital  projects  and advance
refunding was bolste red by an appreciable decl ine in yiel ds on both revenue and general
obligati on bonds.  Fiscal diff iculties in many stat es meant that s hort-te rm issuance also was
well maint ained.   Credit  quali ty in the munici pal se ctor worsened s omewhat in t he second
half of  2002, wit h the r atio of long- term municipal bond yi elds t o Treasur y yiel ds rising
significantl y late in t he year,  reflecting dete riorating fis cal pos itions and t he heavy pace  of
municipal issuance.
After it resu med net bor rowing in  the se cond half of 2 001, the  Treasury continu ed to
tap market s in vol ume this  year.   Federal  debt gr ew at an 8½ percent  pace in t he fir st ha lf of
the ye ar, fueled by a  significant weakeni ng of t ax recei pts owi ng to r educed t ax rat es and
sluggish income growt h, the  paucit y of t axable c apital gai ns, as  well as  incre ased out lays for

account ing devi ces to creat e fina ncing r oom within t he exis ting $5.95 t rillion s tatutory  debt
limit, wh ich th e Congress ra ised to  $6.4  trillion  on J une 27.  Fed eral b orrowing rem ained at a
brisk 6 ½ percen t pace o ver the se cond  half of 2 002.      
Depository C redit
The expansi on of deposi tory credi t moderat ed in 2002.  Cre dit at thrift institutions
decele rated somewhat fr om last  year’ s pace,  though t he slowdown can be at tributed f or the
most part  to a l arge t hrift institution’ s conver sion t o a bank chart er.  The  growth of  bank
credi t picked up sig nificantl y from the  anemic pace i n 2001, dri ven by a robus t acqui sition of
secur ities, especi ally mortgag e-backed s ecuri ties, as well as  a surg e in home equit y and
resid entia l real e state lo ans.  B usiness lo ans a t com mercial b anks, by c ontrast, co ntinu ed to
run o ff.  The  pricing o f new  busine ss loans in dicated  that ban ks rem ain pa rticularly
concerne d about l ower-qual ity borrowers , consi stent wit h the s elect ivity obser ved in t he
bond and syndi cated loan market s.  In lendi ng to hous eholds,  moderate ne t per centa ges of
dom estic ban ks also tigh tened c redit con ditions fo r credit card  and o ther con sumer loan s in
2002.  The proportion of domestic banks that t ightened credi t standards on residenti al
mortgage loa ns rose la te in the ye ar to the h ighest sha re in the p ast deca de, bu t none theless
remained quite low.
Com mercial banks regis tered st rong profit g ains thi s year, r eflect ing robust fe e
income from mortg age and cr edit card l ending,  more str ingent  cost  contr ols, as well  as the
relatively less e xpensive  funding of fered by  inflows of core  deposit s.  Los s provi sioni ng and
nonperfor ming loan s increase d overall, althou gh ba nks ge nerally re mained v ery w ell

Monetary  Aggregates
M2 grew  7 perc ent this yea r, consid erably b elow  the 10 ¼ percen t rate of incre ase in
2001.  Th e gro wth of M 2 dropped in  the fir st half  of 2 002, owing to a  shar p slo wdown in i ts
liquid components, as t he opportunity cost  of holding M2 leveled out, because deposit  rates
caught  up with t he earl ier fall in market  interest rates.  M2 accel erated sig nificantl y in t he
secon d half, a s hou sehold s, appa rently in resp onse to  falling an d volatile equity p rices,
moved large s ums from domesti c equit y mutual f unds.  M2 growth was  also s upporte d by
anoth er wa ve of m ortgage re financ ing activity, a s mo rtgage intere st rates fell to new  lows. 
With the  expansio n of M2 continu ing to  outr un th at of n ominal in come, M2 velocity
declined for the fifth year in a row.
