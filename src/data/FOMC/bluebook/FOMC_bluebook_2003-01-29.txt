of Governors of the Federal Reserve Syst em.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization proce ss which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain.

(1) Over th e intermeeting period , prices in financial markets were buffeted
by shifting  percep tions of g lobal risks , includin g the situ ations in  Iraq an d North
Korea and the disruptions to oil  supplies i n Venezuela.1  U.S. econom ic releases were
mostly m ixed, although since the surprisingly strong IS M rep ort in early January
market particip ants ha ve m ostly been  disapp ointed  with in coming da ta.  Ad ding to
that di sconte nt, the gui dance many f irms have  been of fering during t he curr ent
corporate report ing season about earni ngs prospects and capi tal spending pl ans has
been downbeat .  That  said,  the abs ence of  a major re velation of  corpora te wrongdoi ng
seemed t o light en inve stors ’ conc erns on t hat sc ore.  In addit ion, the unve iling of the
Adm inistration’s economic stimulu s package, which w as larger than had been
previo usly anticip ated, created  the sense  that sub stantial ad ditiona l fiscal imp etus is in
train.  M arket pa rticipants a ppare ntly are n ow b etting tha t the fou rth-qu arter lull in

can be  read fro m m oney m arket futu res.  These  contra cts sugg est that the  FOMC will
stay on hold w ell into the third quarter and tighten  by almost ½  percentage point less
by m id-2004 than was expected at the time of the December meeting.

The Implementation of Monetary Policy over the Intermeeting Period
 
  The Desk relied entirely on temporary operations to offset the factors affecting reserves over the intermeeting period.  The trend increase in currency seems to have slowed some, making it unnecessary to purchase Treasury 
securities outright.  Repurchase agreem ents were built up to accommodate the 
holiday increase in currency in circulation and then run down as currency flowed back to the Federal Reserve after year-end (table).  In the event, the federal funds rate has averaged close to 1-1/4 percent since the December 
meeting and has mostly traded in a tight range around that level (chart).  As a 
result, only a modest volume of credit was extended through the discount 
window.  Since Januar y 9, loans made outside the seasonal lending program 
have been charged a penalty rate under our new lending facilities.  The daily 
quantity of primary credit outstanding averaged about $9 million.  A total of 
thirty-one, predominantly small, institutions have borrowed, including twenty-five commercial banks, five thrifts, and one credit union.  No secondary credit loans were extended.

Policy Al ternati ves
(7) The data that have become avail able since  the December meeting have
made even starker the  contrast i n the economic outlook in the past  few Greenbooks
between ne ar-term slugg ishne ss and l onger- term st rength .  Busi nesse s’ apparent
reluc tance  to inve st and wi llingness  to kee p even l eaner i nventor y posi tions  brought
outp ut gro wth to  a stand still last quarte r.  But th e contin ued re silience of h ouseh old
spending, prospects for enh anced fiscal stimulus, an upw ard revision to estimated
structur al prod uctivity gr owth , and a w eaker d ollar hav e led the sta ff to raise its
projection for real GD P grow th this year and next.  W ith the funds rate target
assumed t o be unchange d until  tight ening be gins i n mid-2004 , stock pri ces r ising
steadil y, and corporate  bond yields edging down as risk s preads narrow (all  about as
projec ted in the December  Greenbook),  output i s expec ted to  expand 3- 1/2 perc ent
this year and 4-3/4 percen t in 2004, around 1/ 4 and ½  percentage points faster,
respectively, than  in the pr evious f orecast.  Whil e bus inesses hav e remaine d caut ious
about new i nvest ment and hir ing, they a re appar ently managing t o make thei r existing
resources more productive , leading the staf f to rais e its as sessment of st ructural
prod uctivity.  A s a result, actu al GD P gro wth is p rojected  to rem ain belo w tha t of its
upward-re vised potent ial over t he first ha lf of this year,  contri buting t o a ris e in t he
unemployment rate to 6-1/4 percent.   Thereafter,  economic activit y is see n as
accel erating noti ceabl y, owi ng in par t to a s trengt hening f iscal impetus–thoug h the
fiscal stimu lus that ev entually m aterializes is p rojected  to be sm aller than  the pro posals
curren tly on the t able.   The unemployment r ate dr ops to j ust under  5-1/2 pe rcent  by
the end o f next year, still about ½  pe rcentage point above the staff’s NAIRU
estimate .  Inflation ed ges do wn a  bit m ore tha n in the  Dece mber Gr eenbo ok ow ing to

of higher oil  and non-oil import prices .  The core PCE inflati on rate is onl y a tad

Monetary  Poli cy and Geopol itical Tens ions
The p hrase “g eopo litical tension s” that h as gained  much cur rency o f late is
meant to s tand i n for a v ariety of  global  troubl e spots , most not ably i ncludi ng a
possib le war w ith Iraq, n uclear stan doff on  the K orean  penin sula, a gen eral strike in
Venezuela t hat has  curta iled the f low of oi l from that import ant suppl ier, and the
risk of te rrori st attacks  around the  globe.   To put it  mildly , economists  cannot
provid e mu ch gu idance  on q uantifyin g the p robab ility of wh en these  prob lems w ill
come to a he ad or how the public w ill react a s they are played out.  
The diff iculties in s pecif ying s uch uncer tainties in a mea ningful  way li e at t he
heart  of why the  staff forecast does no t spel l out a s ingle  scena rio as  to how the
situation  in Ira q is s ettled.  But  to the  exte nt that  the st aff follows the l ead of
markets–say, as in  the forec ast that oil p rices will gr adua lly recede fro m th eir
curren t levels–some aver age of  potent ial scena rios is implici t in pa rts of  the
Greenbook.
Over the yea rs, a simp le syllogism  has serve d the C ommittee w ell in
explaining how  an event essentially exogenous to its action influences its decisions,
whether that even t be a major fiscal initiative, a change in the stance of mon etary
policy abroad, or a significant swing in a k ey asset price.  The logic runs:
   • Give n the lag s in the effect o f mo netary p olicy, a centra l bank s hould
be pre emptive–tha t is, act in adva nce of an ticipated m ajor sho cks to
the econom ic system;
   
   • Setting polic y pree mptivel y requi res ba sing de cisions on a  forec ast of
aggregate dem and and in flation pressures;
   
   • As a result, any event that affects the forecast influences monetary
policy.   
   
Following  this argumen t, the Com mittee wou ld presum ably want to pu t in place
policy that best positions the economy to absorb the effec ts of potential h ostilities. 
But in t hat re gard,  the Committee  has al ready r esponded t o geopoli tical tensions  by
pulling the f unds rat e down to a hi storically accommodati ve le vel to counter  the
effec ts of tho se tensions in exacerbating businesses’ rel uctance to hire and spend.

Monetary  Poli cy and Geopol itical Tens ions  (cont inued)
Thus, a ll else equal,  the cur rent s tance  of poli cy would not  need to be
chang ed un less the C ommittee’s assess ments of the p robab ility of war  and th e likely
effect of war on the econo my have ch anged significantly.  Perhaps the m ore
perti nent pos sibility is to cons ider how t he Committee s hould act  if it came t o the
conclus ion tha t war wit h Iraq was  almost a  certainty.  The  problem is  putti ng a si gn
to the  effect of  war on aggre gate de mand and infl ation press ures.   A lesson f rom
the G ulf W ar is that u ncertain ties may  be reso lved by  military a ction, m aking it
possib le that ho useho ld and  busin ess confid ence w ill be em bolde ned sh ould it
become evi dent t hat the  war will  be brie f and s ucces sful.  If so, a n unleas hing of
pent- up priva te demands  fueled in par t by t he curr ently accommodati ve st ance of
monetary policy (at  least a s judged by the lev el of the r eal feder al funds rat e relat ive
to es timates  of its equilibrium) woul d likely combi ne wit h near -term f iscal impetus
to spur a ggregat e demand, pa rticular ly if added s upplie s on the  world market  sent
oil prices tumbling.  Bu t the Com mittee migh t also envisage worse ou tcomes,
including a pro tracted stalemate, the use of weapon s of mass destruction, or a
slashing  of availab le oil sup plies.  W hile the rela tive pro babilities o f such tail ev ents
might heav ily favor  posit ive out comes for  spendi ng, the expec ted cos t to t he
Committee’s objective o f the adv erse on es shou ld they o ccur m ight be s ubstan tial.
  
This is a spe cific example of the genera l property t hat the Comm ittee has
previously note d:  Heightened uncertai nty makes forecas ting diff icult,  implying that
it is harder  to act pr eemp tively.  The C ommittee m ay be ev en less inclin ed to k ey its
policy now o n the expectation of a specific war scenario if it believed that at some
later date public confidence or fragile financial markets m ight need the bo ost
associated  with sig nificant p olicy ease.  T hat said, rese arch o n the z ero bo und to
nom inal interes t rates gen erally has th e imp lication th at it is better to  ease early in
anticipation of an adverse shock than to “ save your ammunition.”
(8) If the C ommittee sh ares the staff’s assessm ent of eco nom ic prosp ects, it
may want to keep  policy unchanged  at thi s meeti ng, ev en grant ed that  the
unemployment r ate seems pois ed to hea d higher  and sta y at a n elev ated l evel for
longer  than had be en expec ted in December.   Given the  lags in monetar y poli cy, the
Comm ittee may vi ew the nea r-term incr ease in economic  slack as i nevit able a nd be
satisfied that the existi ng policy stance will help to return  econom ic growth to a p ace

Uncertain ty Re gard ing th e Eq uilibriu m Rea l Fun ds R ate
As in rec ent bl uebooks,  the sha ded regi on in Chart 3  portra ys the  range of

reflects un certainty a cross the  two m odels u sed (FR B/U S and  a statistical m odel)

historica l data  and a “two- sided” approac h that t akes a ccount of  data and

shaded r egion unde rstates the ful l extent of  uncert ainty becaus e it does not
incorporate the im precision with w hich specific models are estimated –that is,
parameter u ncertainty.  For examp le, standard errors of the equilibrium  rates
estimated using the “two-sided” statistical filter are about 1-1/4 percentage points. 
This yiel ds a 70 percent conf idence inte rval of 2- 1/2 percentage points , wider than
the shaded region  itself.   Mo reover, the standard error for the “o ne-sided” filter

convinced that the existing financial stimu lus will be adequate to ach ieve satisfactory
economic growth with low inflati on, especi ally gi ven the odds of more substanti al

view the  staff’s estimates  of the  natura l rate of unemplo yment or of  the t rend of

would bring t he unemployment  rate more quickl y to i ts nat ural r ate, even wit h a
1 percent core PC E inflation target and an  element of interest-rate smoothin g (see
chart).   The case for eas ing would be strengthened if  the Comm ittee believes  that
current inflation is already at the lower end o f its desirable range so that the further
disinflation i n the Green book should b e avoi ded.  Moreove r, the Committee might  be
concerned that i nflati on could well fall  short of the pat h in the Greenbook absent an
easing, pro ducing a firming in th e real sh ort-term interest rate.  The Comm ittee might
put particular weigh t on that possibility if it believes t hat, owing to the glob al threats,
continued cap ital overhangs, and lingering bu siness pessimism, the chance of further
sluggish investment an d hiring rem ains unacceptably high .  In such a circumstance,
the Committee  may see a dditi onal st imulus as  needed t o support  overal l spe nding
until  busine ss conf idence  can rec over.   In addit ion, while t he sta ff ha s rea d the
continuing w eakness in the labor m arket as signaling higher structural prod uctivity,
the Com mittee may p lace sizable odds on the v iew that the same d ata augur m ore

The perfect foresight simulations extend the key assumptions of the staff outlook (other than the path for monetary policy) thr ough 2008:
      ●      potential output grows at about 3-3/4 percent per year
      ●      the relative price of oil stabilizes at its end of 2004 level
      ●      the exchange value of dollar measured in real terms falls at a 3 percent clip
      ●      federal budget deficit relative to GDP declines moderately
1.  The real federal funds rate is calculated as the quarterly average nominal funds rate minus the four-quarter lagged core PC E inflation
rate as a proxy for inflation expectations.

the ann ounceme nt.  In con trast, a 25 ba sis point e asing, even  if associated  with
continued b alance in the risk assessment, would  surprise markets and  likely induce a
decline in short-term interest rates of roughly com parable ma gnitude.  Long er-term

decli nes would be  tempered i f equi ties rallied.  However,  the odds o f a si gnificant

appreciable further weakness in economic activity.    
(11) Under the  Gree nbook fore cast, the gro wth o f total no nfinan cial debt is
projected to slow to a 6-1/4 percent rate this quarter and to 5 -1/2 percent in th e next. 
The gov ernmen t compo nents, both federal and state and local, register the sharpest
decel eration over  the per iod.4  Household borrowing is projected to moderate,  as
purchases of cars and n ew hom es finally slow from their brisk run.  Bu siness
borrowing i s proj ected to pic k up over t he first ha lf of this year,  with some r estoc king

Firms are expected once a gain to turn to the bond market for  most of their ext ernal

The Treasury Debt Ceilin g
  Congress raised the debt limit to $6.4 trillion last summer, but the pace o
f
borrowing since then has pushed debt su bject to the limit to within about $60 
billion of this ceiling (chart).  Staff estimates suggest that–absent Congressional 
action–the current ceiling will become binding by mid-February.  Thereafter, 
the Treasury would need to resort to the tactics it has followed in past episodes–calling in compensating balances at depository institutions to obtain more operating cash and temporarily disinvesting government pension funds--
to create room under the ceiling for the issuance of marketable debt.  Such 
maneuvers could create a funding cushion of perhaps $100 billion–enough to allow the Treasury to operate comfortably for a few weeks and perhaps until its cash is replenished by April tax receipts.

(12) Over th e first half of this year,  M2 is projected to grow a t a pace closer
to that o f nom inal inco me, after h aving p osted a 2 -3/4 p ercent d ecline in its v elocity
last year.   The moderati on in M2 growth owes pa rtly to t he ebbing  of the  respons e of
money demand to the  easing of la st November a nd partl y to t he unwinding o f the
boost t o the agg regat e from the  latest wave  of mortgag e refinanci ngs.  That sai d,
mon thly growth rates of M 2 are likely to be uneven in the p eriod just ahead, in part
because the st aff proje cts an unusually  small buildup of deposit s ahead of the April t ax
date owing  to another year of low  individual tax paym ents.
