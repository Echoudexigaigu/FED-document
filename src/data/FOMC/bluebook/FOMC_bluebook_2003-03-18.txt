MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATI VES
Recent D evelop ments
(1) With the probability of imm inent war havin g increased, investors
apparently shifted away from  some aspects of risk taking, intensifying dow nward
pressur e on eq uity price s and in terest rates o ver the in terme eting pe riod.  Th e fall in
stock  price s, whi ch cumulat ed to about  3 perce nt for  broad inde xes, was amplif ied by
lackluster ear nings r eports  and disa ppointi ng data on a uto sal es, labor mark ets, and
consumer conf idence .  Financia l market s were qui te sensitive to shif ting pe rcept ions
of the  likelihood of  war.  For  instance,  just today e quity p rices rallied sharpl y and
bond yiel ds rose  markedly , on news  of a pos sible dela y in a ne w U.N. res oluti on on
Iraq.   On net, marke t part icipants s eemed to i nterpr et dev elopments  over t he
interm eeting p eriod a s sugge sting tha t the on set of vigo rous ec onomic g rowth wo uld
be a little more delayed than p reviously expected.  The term  structure of mon ey
market f utures  rates tilted down, as i nvest ors appe ar to ha ve once a gain put  off t he
time at  which poli cy is expect ed to begi n tight ening,  shifting t he date  from mid-
summer to la te in the ye ar, and reduci ng the ex pecte d amount of t ighte ning by t he
middle of n ext year by 35 basis points.1  (Ad ditiona l detail abo ut po licy expec tations is
provid ed in th e box  on th e next p age.) 
Monetary  Poli cy Expec tations
Money market f utures  sugges t that  inves tors h ave tr immed their  expect ed path of
the f ederal  funds r ate a s much as 3/8  perce ntage poi nt over  the i ntermeet ing per iod
(Chart 1).  As for the u pcom ing FO MC meeting, the A pril federal funds futures
contra ct is now  trading  abou t 8 basis p oints be low th e FO MC’s inten ded ra te of  
1-1/4 pe rcent , cons istent wit h a one-i n-thr ee chanc e of a 1 /4 perce ntage poi nt
easing on March 18.  Market chatter  seems to put the odds of act ion lower than
this, sug gesting tha t the  futur es ra te embodie s some poss ibility of a 1/2 p ercentage
point move.   Analyst s are  incre asing ly of the vi ew that a t this meeti ng the
Committee will shift its asse ssmen t of the risks to  its objective s from  balanc ed to
tilted toward econo mic weak ness.
Accordin g to op tions pr ices, the im plied p robab ility distribu tion for th e fund s rate
six months  henc e has  beco me more s kewed  to the downs ide.  Indeed , about
8 perce nt of t he probabi lity mass now re sts at le vels of the  feder al funds rat e at or
below 50 b asis points. 2
(2) Treasur y coupon yi elds dropped 10 t o 30 basi s point s over  the
intermeeti ng peri od, on net , pulled down by l ower poli cy rat e expec tations and
perhaps by enh anced investor dem ands for safety (Chart 2).  M uch of these declines
were accoun ted for by lower forw ard rates at the two- to seven-year m aturities,
consistent with the view that the level of econ omic activity wou ld be on a low er track
for some time.   Indexed- debt yiel ds declined by more than those on thei r nominal
counterparts, implying an  edging higher o f implied inflation com pensation.  Survey
measures of long er-term inflation expectations, in contrast, held steady.
(3) Despite  the ev ident  jitters about the  possi bility of  war and inc reasing
conce rns abo ut econ omic fund amentals, decline s in rates o n investm ent-grad e private
instruments som ewhat exceeded  those on com parable-maturity Trea suries.  Risk
spreads for lower tier instrum ents were abou t unchanged  at high levels, and measures
of implied volatility in stock and bo nd m arkets remained elevated.  Th e term structure

might beco me conside rably  more expans ionary .  Offi cial yen sa les conti nued as t he
dolla r moved lower l ater in the  period.2 
(5) The dollar was about unchanged over the inte rmeeting period agains t an
index of the currencies of ou r other impo rtant trading partners.  The do llar rose 
about 6 percent agai nst the Korean won, while Korean stocks decl ined more than 11 
percent,  largely  in reacti on to rising t ensions in t hat part of t he world.  The Mexican
central b ank so ught to  bring in flation do wn w ith ano ther rou nd o f tightenin g in early
February, but un certainties about the strength of the U .S. economic recovery w eighed
on the pes o at ti mes during t he peri od.  On balanc e, though, t he excha nge val ue of
the peso  firmed  abou t 1 percen t against th e dollar.  B razilian fin ancial m arkets
continued to im prove, even as the Braz ilian central bank tightened po licy another
notch i n February  by rai sing i ts target  overni ght int erest rate 1 perc entage  point.   The
real strengthened about 5- 1/2 percent,  and the spread over Treas ury yields  of Brazilia n
sovereig n deb t issued in  dollars (B razil’s EM BI+ spread ) narro wed abou t 320 ba sis
points during the period. 
(6) The pace o f business borrow ing receded in Feb ruary from the b risker
pace of January, but remained somewhat above that of th e fourth quarter (Chart 4). 
Business borrowing continued to be concentrated in bon d financing, as firms
exploited the historically low l evel of longer-term i nterest rates by p aying do wn
outst anding s hort- term debt  with the  procee ds of bond i ssuanc e.  House hold debt
growth cont inued t o be dominate d by heavy  mortgage bor rowing.   Growth of

5
consumer cr edit, after stalling in t he fourt h quarte r, jumped at banks  in Janua ry and
February, i n part owing to tax ref und anticipati on loans.  The pace of f ederal
borro wing  picked  up in  the first qu arter, and  federal d ebt ou tstandin g reach ed its
statutory limit in mid-Feb ruary.  How ever, the Treasury has been ab le to use
account ing devi ces to allow its r egular  aucti ons to go f orward.   Although down from
the hi gh leve l of l ate last year, issuance of  state and loc al bonds  has re mained st rong
this year.  Backward-looking m easures of corporate asset quality–bo nd default rates
and C&I  loan delinquency rates–are showing signs of stabilization or even some
improvem ent.  With equ ity prices in a downd raft, gross equity issuance has remained
subdued  and net issuance neg ative.
(7) M2 growth w as exceptionally strong in Febru ary, owing m ainly to robust
inflows to li quid depos its.  Rapid money  growth appe ared t o refl ect e arlier tax ref unds
(owing to grea ter use of electronic filing) and hefty mortgage p repaymen ts as record
low interest  rates s purred refinanci ng activit y.  Money growth may also have
benefitted  from  the on going  retreat from  equity m arkets.  Th e expan sion of liq uid
depo sits additio nally reflected  shifts from  other co mponen ts of M 2, includ ing retail
money funds–whos e yields hav e fallen to about the  same le vel a s MM DA rates–and
small time dep osits.  The ample availability of low-cost depo sit funds over the past
year ha s fac ilitated wide net  interest margins a t commercia l banks , to the bene fit of
their profitability,  the subject of the box on  the next page.

Bank Profi tability in 2002
Banks’ returns on as sets and equit y both moved up  smartly l ast year , the former t o a three-
decad e high.  A  major con tributor to th e rise in pro fitability was a  large dro p in no ninterest
expense, an important part  of which appears to be att ributable  to a regulat ory change that
eliminated t he requi rement t o amorti ze goodwil l unle ss it is impaire d.  A low leve l of bank
mergers last year also likely held dow n noninterest expen se.  Salaries and benefits, howe ver,
which h ad been fallin g for  seve ral ye ars as  a sha re of  reve nue, edg ed up in 2 002.  P rofita bility
also benefitted considerably from  a large widening o f interest rate s preads, wh ich in turn
importantly reflected a surge in low -cost transaction and savings dep osits as investors
respon ded to  the very  low o pportunity co st of hold ing liquid  assets and  adve rse
devel opments  in eq uity marke ts.  In addi tion, f alling long er-term int erest rates allowed banks
to realize siza ble cap ital gains on  securities ho ldings fo r the seco nd co nsecu tive year in  2002. 
Finally, loan-lo ss prov isioning, w hich h ad risen  sharply  in 20 00 an d 2001, h eld stead y last
year, alb eit at twice the  pace o f the m id-19 90s.  
Altho ugh b anks b egan la st year w ith very c omfortable c apital leve ls, they cho se to bo ost
them  further b y retaining  incom e at som ewhat abov e the pa ce of the  preced ing two  years. 
The rise in risk-b ased ca pital m easures w as particu larly large, refle cting the sh ift in bank s’
portfoli os away from full ris k-weight business  loans toward lower ris k-weight resi dential
mortgages an d mortgage- back ed secu rities.  With  the cush ion of  addition al capital,
commercial ba nks appear  relatively resilient going f orward.

Policy Alternatives
(8) The broad cont ours of  the st aff forec ast remain si milar t o those  of the
January  Greenbook,  with moderat e growth of  activity giving way to rob ust ex pansio n
in the seco nd h alf of this year .  How ever, recen tly som e sour e cono mic
releases–particularly indicators of labor market con ditions and con sumer
sentiment–and lower equity pri ces and higher oil  prices i n the baseli ne forecast  have
led the st aff to writ e down somew hat weaker growth of real  GD P this year a nd next as
well as a higher unemployment rate at th e end of the  Greenbook forecast interval. 
Partly as  a result,  this for ecast as sumes that the int ended federal f unds rate will hol d at
1-1/4 pe rcent  throughout  the f orecas t peri od, ra ther t han turni ng upward in t he
second half of 2 004 as in the pri or Greenbook.  As was true in the January Greenbook,
the current forecast does not em body a specific scenario for resolution of the co nflict
with Ir aq.  Rat her, the f orecas t is premise d on fina ncial  assumpti ons that  are gui ded by
curren t mar ket qu otes that a ppear  to be co nsistent w ith a high  likelihoo d of a rela tively
short  and succ essful war but t hat al so encompas s a ra nge of pot ential resolut ions of
that con flict.  This is m ost evide nt for o il prices, wh ich the sta ff assum es will fall
substantially in coming q uarters in line with the current con figuration of oil price
futur es.  Equity pri ces a re as sumed to inc rease from the ir cur rent l evel over t he
forecast p eriod a t a rate that p rovide s investor s with a  risk-adju sted retu rn com parab le
to that  on longer -term bonds.  Corpor ate bond y ields are  pulle d lower ove r the
forec ast pe riod as  a gradual  improvement i n the ec onomic outl ook and a par tial lifting
of uncer tainty spur  a narrowi ng in ri sk spr eads.   With these  assumpti ons, GDP growth,
after runnin g bel ow that  of pot ential ov er the first half of this year, begi ns to pic k up
smartl y as f alling oil  price s, improving se ntiment , accommodative monet ary pol icy, and
tax cuts provi de a lif t to household and business s pending.  However, even with an
acceleration in GD P in 2004 to a 4-1/ 2 percent pace, outpu t at the end of the forecast
8
period r emains a bout 3/4 per cent be low the s taff’s estimate of  potent ial GDP and the
unem ploymen t rate is 5-1/2 percent, about 1/2 percen tage point above its estimated
natural rate.  The persistent slack in resource usage is large enou gh to offset the effect
on core inflation of higher o il prices and a weaker do llar; core PCE p rices are projected
to rise about 1-1/4 and  1 percent in 2003 and  2004, respectively.
(9) If the Committee r emains of  the vi ew that t he curr ent se tting of the
feder al funds rat e likely would provi de enough st imulus t o redre ss the exi sting amount
of res ource s lack over t ime while  maintai ning low i nflation,  it may wi sh to keep t he
target rate unchanged .  To be sure, global tensions have escalated in recen t weeks,
and th e unce rtainties asso ciated w ith deve lopm ents in Ira q and  the atten dant rise  in oil
prices seem  to be w eighing  heavily o n finan cial ma rkets and  restrainin g econ omic
activity.  But the Com mittee may b elieve that a significant portion of these
fundamenta l uncer tainties will  be res olved be fore l ong and–as was  the ca se followi ng
the onset of the G ulf War in 1 991–lead to a no table improvem ent in financial market
cond itions (C hart 5).  M oreov er, althou gh m any ob servers h ave w orried th at high er oil
price s may cont inue t o depres s spendi ng, as  disc ussed i n the Green book, i t is persi stent
increases in  oil prices th at have m aterially adv erse im plication s for activity.  In fa ct,
futures a nd o ptions d ata sugg est that m arket pa rticipants d o no t expect th e curren tly
elevated l evel and uncert ainty about oi l prices to persi st (Chart 6) .  Moreover , whil e the
nominal price of oil  has approached histori cal highs,  the recent s pike does not appear
outsiz ed in rea l terms.  E ven if the C ommittee is co ncern ed that th e pace o f econo mic
growth co uld remain  subpar on ce some of the cu rrent uncertainties have been
resolved, it still may see a considerable advantage to deferring policy action at this time
in order  to await  more info rmation a bout geopol itical de velopment s.  Indeed,  inact ion
at thi s meeti ng might se em especi ally attractive if the  Comm ittee wants  to pres erve t he
option of easing forcefully if e vents turn unexpectedly ad verse in  com ing weeks.

Moreover, in the current  environment, the re sponse of the ec onomy to policy action at
this meeting m ight be viewed as q uite uncertain, and m odels of optima l monetary
policy under uncertainty would counsel gradualism in adjusting policy.  
(10) If the Committee vi ewed the r ange of  possi ble out comes for  the
economy over  the f orese eable  futur e as f airly symmetri c around i ts forecas t, it might
also cho ose to re tain a balanc ed ri sks as sessment  at this mee ting.  Whi le some
econo mic d ata hav e prov ed disap pointin g of late, a suc cessful pro secution  of a wa r in
Iraq co uld trigg er a sub stantial rally in  equity m arkets an d pro mpt a sharp  rebou nd in
confidence, suggesting that upside risks m ay be significant.  The Com mittee migh t also
favor a neutral balance of risks if it regarded the risks as unusually difficult to assess
and subje ct to  rapid c hange.   If, instead, the Committee  judges  that t he dis tribution of
possible outcomes f or economic activit y is appreci ably skewed toward more downbeat
scenario s, it migh t be inclin ed to  shift the  balan ce of risks tow ard econ omic
weak ness , although it may b e concerned that m arkets could see such a decision as a
signal of more co nviction about the o utlook than it actually has.
(11) Becau se curren t futures q uotes p ut som e odd s on an  easing at th is
meeting, a decision to leave the target rate unch anged and  the risk assessment balanced
would likely pr ompt an in crease in m arket yield s and a  corresp onding do wntick  in
stock prices.  Howev er, in light of the unusual geopo litical aspect to the uncertainties
about the near-term  outlook and  the prospect that they m ay be partly resolved
sometim e soon, market pa rticipants are not likely to extrapolate this monetary po licy
combinatio n very far  forwa rd in rev ising their  expecta tions, wh ich wo uld w ork to m ute
the likely market  react ion.  In pri ncipl e, keeping  polic y unchange d but shi fting the
balanc e of ri sks toward economic  weakness  would come clos er to mat ching c urrent
market expe ctations, an d their h eighten ed exp ectation o f mo re imm inent eas ing w ould
tend t o offs et disappoi ntment about  the l ack of  immediate  action.  In p ractice, though,
10
market partici pants may infer f rom the Com mittee’ s decisi on to alter t he risks
assessment t hat the  economic out look was bl eaker  than pre viousl y expec ted, pulli ng
bond yields and  stock prices lower.
(12) The Comm ittee might i nterpr et some of  the re cent da ta, parti cular ly the
Febru ary em ploym ent repo rt, as pointin g to a w eaker tren d in eco nom ic activity than  it
previo usly tho ught– and o ne that m ight w ell persist even  if global ten sions w ere to
diminis h markedly  in the  weeks ahe ad.  Agai nst this bac kdrop,  the Committee  might
conclude that a policy eas ing at thi s meeti ng is a ppropri ate.  Indeed,  the cur rent
setting of t he real  feder al funds rat e no longe r lies bel ow the lower  bound of the  range
of staff estimates of  equil ibrium real ra tes (Chart 7) .  As a re sult, members mig ht
conclude  that a  cut i n the nominal  funds r ate woul d be nece ssary just  to mainta in the
effective st ance of  polic y established at  the November meet ing.  The Comm ittee might
consider a  quart er-point  poli cy eas ing as a measured  response to a projected
short fall of e conomic growt h below tha t of pot ential this year.  However, t he
Com mittee migh t instead favor a more ag gressive half-point pol icy e asing  if the
possibility of especially adverse shocks and the constraints on p olicy posed by the zero
bound to nominal  interest rates loomed l arge i n its thinki ng.  The a pparent  stabi lity of
inflation expect ations in t he fac e of hi gher oi l prices a nd a weaker  dolla r along  with the
Gree nbook pro jection fo r further  declines in  core inflatio n from  already lo w levels
migh t be view ed as arg uing fo r the m ore agg ressive po licy action, in asmu ch as its
potent ial cost i n terms of  higher  risks of i nflation pr essur es would app ear to be
minim al.  Indeed, the Com mittee migh t even welcom e a small uptick in projected
inflation.  M oreov er, the m arket resp onse to  a successfu l prosecu tion of w ar in Iraq  is
not ent irely clear.  In contr ast to the ex perie nce around t he Gulf War in 19 91, c oncerns
about geopolitic al tensi ons may not be punctured by decisive mil itary vi ctory,  as

questi ons coul d still linger  about the  formulat ion of a  new government  in Ira q, th e
prospect for terrorist acts, and the situation in other trouble spo ts.
(13) As noted,  market pr ices can be i nterpr eted a s inc orporat ing some odds
on a po licy move at t his meeting, but a quarter-point easing is f ar from fully priced in.  
As a result, either a quarter-point or half-point easing at this m eeting would  have a
substantial element of surprise.  Bon d and stock p rices would tend  to climb in either
case, but  the marke t reaction could be s ignificant ly influe nced by t he choic e of t he
balance-of -risks asses sment and the wording of the announcement.  A balanced risks
assessment would likely be taken by market participants as a sign that the FOMC
would  be reluctant to ease mo re anytime soon , while a balance of risks tilted toward
economic weakness would lead them to p lace higher odds on further policy easings.  
(14) Under the Greenbook assumptions, growth of domestic nonfinanci al
debt is expected to run  at about a 7 percen t pace this year and next.  In the business
sector, the p rojected  recover y in inves tmen t spend ing is asso ciated w ith a no table
increase in  the financing gap, which in tu rn, leads to an u pturn in business borrowing. 
With credit spreads contracting, the forecast anticipates that much o f this increased
deman d for financing will be m et by firms tapping cap ital markets.  Businesses are
projec ted to  conti nue to re ly hea vily on the bond marke t, while c ommercial pa per and
bank l oans , after runnin g off  shar ply over  the p ast two ye ars, are expec ted t o be ab out
unch anged  this year an d register  a mo dest adv ance in  2004.  A  gradu al relaxatio n in
bank term s and standards m ay well also to contribute to the p rojected rise in business
loans.  In contrast, households sho uld rein in the grow th of mortga ge debt in respon se
to the as sumed l eveling of f of mortga ge ra tes, whi ch re duces  the i ncen tives for cashout
refinanc ings.  Th e expan sion of c onsu mer c redit pro bably w ill dip this yea r, largely
reflecting a moderati on in the  pace of  spendi ng on motor vehi cles.  Fede ral bor rowing
is expected to rise over the forecast period, propelled by rising m ilitary expenditures
12
and by tax cuts that trim  receipts.  State and local debt growth  is forecasted to taper
off, with st ate a nd local  government s anti cipat ed to sc ale ba ck advanc e refunding
issuance  and a lso to take  steps to re store ba lanced  bud gets.  The  staff projects M 2 to
advance at a  6-1/2 percent pace th is year–somewhat faster th an nominal GDP growth. 
The anti cipat ed decl ine in M2 velocit y this yea r is attributab le to the l agged ef fects of
the pol icy easing  last November and to a f urther  boost t o money growth f rom
mortgage r efinancing .
