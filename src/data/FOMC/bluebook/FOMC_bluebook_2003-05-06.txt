Prefatory Note  
 
 
The attached document represents the most  complete and accurate version available 
based on original copies culled from the f iles of the FOMC Secretariat at the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve Syst em.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization proce ss which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain. 
 Please note that some material may have b een redacted from this document if that 
material was received on a confidential ba sis.  Redacted material is indicated by 
occasional gaps in the text or by gray boxe s around non-text content.  All redacted

1  In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic 
format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to rem ove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing). 
 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optical character recognition computer program (OCR) 
first created electronic text from the document im age.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, 
staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.  Pl ease note that the numbers and text in charts and 
tables were not reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff.

The Effe cts of War-Rel ated News on Tr easur y Yiel ds
On balance,  the yi eld on t he two-y ear Tre asury  note ( the t hick l ine in the
upper panel of Chart 2) has f allen 63 basi s points si nce September 11, 2002,  the day
before  Presi dent Bush’ s spee ch at t he U.N. Gener al Asse mbly that  first called on
the worl d to dis arm Iraq.   Financi al marke t commentary  sugges ts that some of  the
movements in  the yi eld (and other  asse t prices) during t his pe riod were  drive n by
chang ing view s regard ing the p rospec t for wa r with I raq an d, in the ev ent, by its
relatively quick resolution.  Presumab ly, the channels of such influence on T reasury
yields inc lude ef fects on inve stors ’ out look f or economic  activity and inf lation, t he
attendant cons equences  for moneta ry poli cy, and change s in t he perc eption of and
attitude toward bearing risk.
Quantifying  these effects, and  the exten t to wh ich they h ave un wound, is
complicated because other factors also have left t heir imprint on Treasury yields. 
To con trol for the systematic effect of macroeconom ic information, daily changes
in the two-year Treasu ry yield over the past 15 years were regressed o n the surprise
component of  15 data  releases, where  the sur prises were  measured us ing the
median expe ctation fr om surveys  conducte d by Money Market Ser vices.  Acc ording
to thi s regr ession, incoming news s ince t he fal l of l ast year hav e pull ed down the
two-ye ar yield about  60 basi s point s (the thi n line  in the  upper pane l).  The
unexpla ined port ion of t he yie ld movements v aried quite a  bit ove r this peri od and,
on n et, left the yield little ch anged  (the do tted line in  the m iddle p anel).
By no m eans is war-related news likely to accoun t for all these unexplained
movem ents.  Indeed, before mid-D ecember, the wo rds “Iraq” or “w ar” were
mention ed only occasionally in the C redit Markets colu mn o f the Wall Stree t Jour nal 
(the bottom panel).   Beginning in December, however, mention of war with Ir aq as
an expl anati on of Trea sury y ield movements st epped up cons idera bly.  From
September 1 1, 20 02, to March 5, 20 03, the nadir  of most Tre asury  yields, the two-
year note rate fell about 70 basis points, with m ost of that decline attributable to the
unexpla ined component  on days i n which war news  was prominent .  Simil arly, the
rebound in that yiel d since then i s mainly accounted for  by influences  other than
the predicta ble responses  to economic data surpris es on days when financia l
reporters,  at leas t, were f ocusing on the war, with t he most dramatic move
occurring in the r un-up to the March 18th FOM C meeting.   Over the i ntermeet ing
period i tself, a diminuti on of war ef fects appar ently off set some, but not  all, of the
drag on yields as sociate d with mostly softe r economic data.

3 Over the inte rmee ting per iod, the fed eral fund s rate avera ged clo se to its
1¼ percen t target.  Th e Des k has p urcha sed $7.6 b illion of T reasury s ecurities in
outright operations: $5.3 billion of Treasury co upon secu rities and bills in the market
and $2. 3 billion of  bills from foreig n offi cial institutions.   The outst anding vol ume of
long-t erm Syste m RPs was unchanged,  on net,  at $16 bi llion.(2) The abatem ent of war-related risks has been reflected in sizable declines
in forward-looking  measures of un certainty in short- and long-term  interest rates,
exchan ge rates, and  oil and  equity p rices (Ch arts 1 and  3).  Risk sp reads o n corp orate
debt securities have narrow ed across the credit quality spectrum –probab ly pulled
down a lso in part by expectations of impr oved def ault and re covery rates–and  flows
into hi gh-yi eld bond mutual  funds ha ve been s ubstant ial.  The s pread bet ween the

(4) After recording a sharp rise in the days just before the Mar ch FOMC

Mexican p eso gain ed abo ut 6 pe rcent as th e Ban k of M exico tigh tened p olicy aga in
near the end of March.  Favorable  developments in Brazil,  including an
announcement that the primary budget surplus in 2002 exceeded its target and some
progres s on fi scal and pensi on refo rm, buoyed f inanci al marke ts there.   Extending
recent trends, the real appre ciated a lmost  17 pe rcent, Brazi lian st ocks  moved up
15 percent, and Brazil’s EMBI+  spread narrowed 230 basis points.  Mar kets in some
Asian count ries were buff eted not iceably by ne ws about t he SARS epidemic and
menacing rhetoric f rom N orth Korea.  The most visible  market reacti on to SAR S was
in Hong Kong,  where  stock pr ices dec lined s harpl y midway  through t he pe riod but
recouped m uch of that loss in recent days.  For a tim e, Korean m arkets were
support ed by buil ding opti mism that di plomati c progre ss would be  made on the
impasse with N orth K orea, but those gains were k nocked ba ck somew hat when  such
hopes w aned in recent days.
(6) Despite  improvements  in market  condit ions,  domestic  busine ss demands
for cr edit have re mained sl uggish i n rece nt months,  owing importa ntly to a cont inuing
narrow g ap between  capital expenditures and intern al sources of funds.  Gross
issuance  of corp orate b onds slowe d som ewhat in the p ast coup le of m onth s from  its
relatively robus t pace  earlier in the ye ar, and borrower s conti nued to use  much of the
proceeds to pay down other debt, especially co mmercial paper and C&I loans. 
Indeed, according to resp onses to the A pril Senior Loan  Officer O pinion Su rvey,
demand for C&I loans has weakened further over th e past three months.  However, a
notabl y small er net  perce ntage of  banks re ported t ighte ning loa n terms a nd standa rds
than i n rece nt surv eys.  Household debt  is estimated to ha ve grown 9½ perce nt in t he
first quarter, only a touch below th e average pace in 2002, prop elled by continued
rapid gr owth of mortga ge debt t hat has  been fue led by r ecord l evels of r efinancing
activity.   Con sumer credit expanded mo derately in the first quarter, at about the same
6
rate as la st year, but consumer loans at banks are  estimated to h ave weakened in A pril. 
Facing grow ing financing needs, the Treasu ry announ ced yesterday additional chan ges
to its auct ion sc hedule.   (See t he box on the  next pag e on Treas ury debt  management
developments.)
(7) M2 growth slowed ove r March and April , but  most of t he dece leration
appea red to b e attribu table to ta x-related fac tors.  A s hift tow ard earlier  electron ic

Treas ury D ebt M anag ement D evelop ments
The average maturity  of T reasu ry de bt he ld by  the p ublic has bee n falling sin ce late
2001, nea rly reversin g an u ptrend  that had  started in the  mid -1990s.  Th is decline  is partly
attributable t o the expectati on of Treasury debt managers that  the surge i n federal
borrowing in late 2001 and early 2002 would be short-li ved and thus better
accommodat ed throug h inc reased o fferings o f short-term se curities.  As def icits have
apparently be come more p ersisten t, the T reasu ry ha s ann ounced measures to in crease its
borro wing  capac ity in longe r-dated  securities in re cent qu arterly refu nding  stateme nts. 
For insta nce, qua rterly a uctio ns of thre e-year no tes w ill be r eintro duced next w eek with
the primary purpose of all owing the Treasury to r educe its borr owing in bills  and two-year
notes.  In  addition , the Trea sury an nounced  at yesterda y’s qua rterly refun ding p ress
confe rence th at, starting in A ugust, it w ill issue five-ye ar notes o n a m onthly  basis,
introduce regul ar reopenings of t he ten-year note  (to t ake place about a month after each
refunding aucti on) and increase t he numb er of ten-year  indexed note auctions f rom three
to four  times  a year.   In tot al, the Tre asury  will sell $58 bil lion of  notes  at the upcoming
quart erly refundi ng auc tions—the l argest refundin g off ering si nce 1996 .
Given  that the Congress has n ot yet taken action to raise the Treasury’s statutory
borrowing limit of $6. 4 tril lion, t he Treasury has been engaging i n extraordinary measures
to keep i ts statutory  debt under  the l imit a nd avoid any di srupt ions t o the May ref unding
aucti ons.  On April  4, the  Treasur y invoked i ts authori ty to suspend i ssuing debt t o the
Civil Service R etirement and D isability Fund until July 11, 200 3.  In addition, the Treasury
has been underinvesti ng two other trust  funds: the Thrif t Savings Plan of Federal
Retirem ent Th rift Investm ent Bo ard (the “G -fund ”) and th e Ex chan ge Stab ilization F und. 
Yesterd ay, th e Treasury ind icated  that th ese m easures w ill allow  it to stay  with in its
statutory debt li mit only until  the second half of May.

Policy Al ternati ves
(8) The c onto urs of th e staff outlo ok for th is meetin g are ge nerally sim ilar to
those in  the prev ious few  projectio ns in tha t near-term  sluggish ness in eco nom ic
growth is  anticipat ed to gi ve way to  more vigor ous expans ion over  the bal ance of  the
forecast p eriod.  T his tim e roun d, projec ted gro wth in  econo mic ac tivity is a bit
weak er in the n ear term  in light o f generally d isappo inting ec onomic d ata released  in
the past se ven w eeks and  slightly stro nger n ext year, give n a hig her track  for we alth
and m ore fiscal stimulus than anticipated in M arch.  The projection is again p remised
on the assumption that the FOMC  keeps the ta rget feder al funds rat e flat  at
1¼ p ercent through th e end of next year.  W hile yields on longer-term T reasuries are
expected to edge u p slightly over the next few qu arters, those on lower-tier
inves tment- grade a nd specul ative-grade se curit ies fall further a s the e xpansi on gains
firmer footi ng.  Equity prices  again are anti cipated to ri se stea dily, but from a base that
is considerably higher than in th e March  Greenb ook.  These financial cond itions are
projected to spur b usiness investment, which, together w ith a bit larger and mo re
front -loaded fi scal stimulus than a ssumed in t he March Greenbook,  contri butes t o a
gradual  accel eration in ov erall activity, wi th rea l GDP growth reac hing 4¾ perce nt
over next  year.  Still, with pr oduct ivity rising bri skly, the u nemplo yment  rate edg es up
over th e next sev eral qu arters, peak ing just a bove 6  percen t before b eginn ing to slip
lower in the second  quarter of next year.  Reflecting the persistent slack in produ ct
and labor  markets , core consumer pr ice inflation i s expec ted to  conti nue to edge
down , but along a slightly lower trajectory that reflects the surprisingly subdued p rice
data of  late.  In t his quar ter and next,  decli nes i n energy  price s are  projec ted to  pull t he
rate of overall PCE  inflation down to  ½ percen t.  Over 2004, both total and  core
inflation average 1 percent.

(9) Should th e Co mmittee believe th e staff forecast like ly and b e attracted  to
the pro jected co mbination  of accelera ting ou tput an d som e further  decline in
inflation, it might wi sh to leave the stance of poli cy unchang ed at th is meeting. 
The projected pickup in t he growth of activi ty, al beit gradual,  does suggest t hat
maintai ning the  curren t stance of  polic y would be cons istent wit h a narrowi ng of the
output gap by the end of next yea r.  Indeed,  the Comm ittee might anticipat e that
economic s lack will be worked down more qui ckly, and downward pr essur es on
inflation diminished corresp ondingly soo ner, than in the Green book.  In particular,
the Com mittee migh t see substantial odds that aggregate dem and will grow  more
vigorously than p ortrayed in the G reenbook.  W ith the war conclud ed, business
confidence could  rebound  sharply and, com bined with the im provem ent in consum er
senti ment and fi nancia l market  condit ions al ready s een, prove more s upporti ve of
growth than projected by the s taff.  In addition,  the forthcoming degree of  fisca l
stimulus, whi ch curr ently is being de bated i n the Congres s, could well  turn out t o be

demand growth about  in line with t hat of  the st aff forec ast, it might  still expect  the
output gap  to shrink mo re quickly if it is les s optimistic about pro ductivity growth.  If
so, the Com mittee may reg ard the further disinflation projected by the staff as less

circumstances of  surprisi ngly low infla tion.  I ndeed, as shown in Chart 6, t he real
short-term federal funds rate do es not differ much from  the level prevailing before
the Com mittee’s Novem ber 6th policy ea sing.  Cu tting the n ominal fun ds rate at th is
meeting may be appropriate to ree stabli sh the previousl y sought spread of t he actual
real fund s rate belo w its estim ated eq uilibrium .  Goin g forw ard, a furth er declin e in
inflation from its already low level, by limiting the scope for red uctions in short-term
interest rates, could inor dinat ely constr ain the abil ity of monetar y poli cy to pr ovide
stimulus in re sponse t o an adver se shoc k to spe nding at  some lat er dat e.  Eve n if t he
Comm ittee sa w the ri sks s urrounding  the proj ected paths of  aggrega te demand and
inflation in the  Greenbook as  symmetri c, it might v iew the  costs  of fa lling
unex pected ly short o f either of th ose path s in com ing qu arters as larg er than  the costs
of an o verage.  In  that case, the  regret asso ciated w ith easing  policy an d sub seque ntly
discoveri ng that  it was  unneces sary would pres umably be s mall re lative to t hat of
holdin g the fun ds rate at 1 ¼ percent an d even tually learn ing tha t a low er level w ould
have been appropriate. 
(11) The evident reducti on in “Knightian uncertainty” i n recent weeks may
incline the Committee t o retur n to it s prac tice of announc ing an as sessment of t he
balance of ri sks.  I f so, a nd if it e lects to leave t he stance of pol icy unchanged, an
outlook in w hich resource slack rem ains substantial and inflation declines slightly over
the nex t sev eral quarte rs, such as  in the  Greenbook,  might sugge st that the  balanc e of
risks is weig hted to ward  econo mic w eakness fo r the fore seeable fu ture.  H owever, if
the Committee  either were  to int erpre t the  “fore seeable future” a s referring to a
period extending beyond the next  few quarters or were t o judge aggregate demand as
likely to be notably stronger or agg regate supply weak er than in the G reenbook, then
it might characterize the risks to its objectives as balanced.  The app ropriate balance

outlook and  perhaps partly on th e forcefulness of its action.  Particularly i f mem bers’
basic ou tlook w as mo re pessim istic than th at of the G reenb ook o r the cos t of a
down side surprise to that outlook loo med especially large, the risks might be view ed
as weig hted to ward  econo mic w eakness— especially if the  easing ac tion w as limited  to
25 basi s point s.  A 25- basis -point  easing couple d with a more s anguine out look f or the
econom y, however, or a 50-basis-point action, by providin g appreciably m ore
stimulus, a rguably could equalize  the risks , espec ially if the “f oreseeable  future” was
interpreted as extending w ell into next year.
(12) Financial mark ets have incorporated a o ne-in-three chance of a policy
easing at t his meet ing.  As to the ba lance -of-risks statement , one- half of the
respon dents to  a recent su rvey of p rimar y dealers e xpected  the FO MC to adop t a
neutra l assessment , but  the ot her hal f were a bout eve nly s plit between e xpect ing one
tilted toward weak ness and a deferral of any assessmen t.  If this re flects broader
market think ing, a dec ision to lea ve the stan ce of m onetar y policy u nchan ged an d to
issue a ne utral ba lance-of-risk s statem ent w ould likely elicit only  a mo dest bac kup in
yields on  money m arket instru ments and h ave little effect on  bon d yields, eq uity
price s, and the f oreig n exchange  value  of the  dolla r.  However , a statement that  the
balance of risks was tilted toward eco nom ic weakness, coupled w ith an unchan ged
stance o f policy, w ould prom pt investo rs to reex amin e their ow n foreca sts and w ould
probably lead to a decl ine in inte rest rat es across  the yiel d curve, es peciall y at
intermediat e maturi ties, and a deprec iation of the  dolla r.  In view of  the count ervai ling
effects of low er interest ra tes and th e chan ce of a w eaker ear nings o utcom e imp licit in
such  a statement of  risks, the r espo nse o f equity prices is mor e difficult to judge,  but
some d ecline cannot be ruled o ut.  An easing of po licy would com e as some surp rise
to finan cial ma rkets, and  short-term  yields w ould fall substan tially.  Bond  yields likely
would  drop as w ell, and equity prices should increase.  A jud gmen t that the risks were
12
weighted toward weakness li kely would give pause t o equity inves tors, while a neutral
balance of risks and a generally op timistic statement that stressed an “insurance”
motive for the action w ould be m ore likely to fuel a stock market rally.

nonfinancial sector debt is expected to ex pand abo ut 7 percent this year, close to last
year’s pace a nd d istinctly abo ve the ra te of exp ansion  of nom inal G DP.  This
relati vely rapi d growth primarily ref lects federal debt , which at 10 perc ent this y ear
expands a bit faster than forecasted in the M arch Green book becau se of wider
projecte d bu dget d eficits.  Busine ss sector d ebt is foreca st to accelera te gradu ally to
