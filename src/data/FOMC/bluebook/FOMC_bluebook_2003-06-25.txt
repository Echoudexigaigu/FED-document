Prefatory Note  
 
 
The attached document represents the most  complete and accurate version available 
based on original copies culled from the f iles of the FOMC Secretariat at the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve Syst em.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization proce ss which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain. 
 Please note that some material may have b een redacted from this document if that

format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to rem ove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing).

first created electronic text from the document im age.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, 
staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.  Pl ease note that the numbers and text in charts and

Recent D evelo pments
(1) The FO MC’s deci sion at it s May meeting to keep the intended f ederal
funds r ate a t 1¼ perce nt came as  no surpri se to most  observ ers.  By contr ast, splitting
the bal ance of  risks int o separ ate a ssessments a bout growth a nd infl ation and
emph asizing a concern ab out further declines of inflation from an  already low level
led marke t part icipants t o mark down thei r poli cy expe ctations.   The announcement
also set  the backdrop against  which subsequent stat ements by Federal Reserve
officials regarding the possibility of deflation and available policy alternatives were
interpreted.  Option s on federal funds futures indicate that m arket participants are
nearl y cer tain of poli cy eas ing at  this meeting,  with a hal f-poi nt cut g iven t wo-to- one
odds over a quarter-poi nt cut.  Given the  sense that  Com mittee members have
becom e more co ncerned abo ut inflation turning out too  low than too  high, market
participants now see a sub stantially longer period of low sho rt-term interest rates;
indeed, the  funds rate i s expected t o remain below its current  level t hrough this year
and m ost of ne xt.1  (The box on t he next  page prov ides more detai l on prev ailing

Policy Expec tations
In addit ion to mark ing down the e xpect ed path of  polic y over t he
intermeeti ng peri od, invest ors bec ame more confi dent about  their fore cast for t he
funds r ate (Chart 1) .  For e xample,  based on opt ions on e urodoll ar fut ures,  the
width of  the 90 pe rcent  confi dence i nterv al around the ex pecte d targe t level one
year ahe ad na rrow ed sub stantially ov er the pe riod to  stand a t the low est level in
many years.
A recentl y introduced opt ions c ontrac t on fe deral  funds f utures  on the
Chicago  Board o f Trade open s a new w indow o n market p articipants’ near-term
policy outlook.   Prices of opt ions at dif ferent s trikes  depend on investors’  subjecti ve
probabil ity asse ssment t hat the  options  will be in t he money at e xpira tion.   The
option -implied  prob ability of n o chan ge in p olicy, the solid  line in the  botto m left
panel, re mained above 50 percent until Ju ne 3, but has since dropped nearly to zero. 
At last reading, these option-im plied probab ilities s uggest that investors consider a
half-point cut in the target rate about twice as likely as a q uarter-point cut.  
Prices o f option s on E urod ollar futu res can b e used in  a similar  way to
constru ct the pro bability d istribution  of the targ et rate later in  the year, sh own in
the bo ttom -right pa nel.  The  most recent d istribution  (in red) h as shifted m arkedly
to the left and the weight on rates in the lower tail has been revised up significantly. 
Indeed , investors ap paren tly place ab out a 1 5 percen t prob ability on  the fun ds rate
trading at or below  ½ percen t in six months.
(2) Consistent with a lower expected p ath for policy, yields on Treasury
coupon  securities shed 35  to 60 basis points over the interm eeting period, with m uch
of the decli ne concentrated i n implied forward rates  at the thre e- to seve n-year
horizon ( Chart 2) .  Inf lation-inde xed yi elds fell somewhat l ess, implyi ng that  inflation
comp ensation declined m oderately.  The desire by m anagers of mo rtgage-backed
security portfolios to extend the duration  of their holdings, which h as been shortened
by the recent wave o f mortgage refinancing s, may have am plified the downw ard
pressure on long er-term yields.  With un certainty about the future cou rse of interest

dolla r lost ground ag ainst  the Brazi lian real, which stre ngthened 3½ percent, as
financia l markets conti nued to reward Brazil for achi eving progress on key  structural
issues.   Brazil’s  EMBI+ spread narrowed about 75 basis points more to about 7¼
percen tage po ints, and B razilian sto cks m oved  up an other 5 ½ percent.  Sto ck m arkets
in se veral  Asian ec onomies–Tai wan, Hong Kong, Korea,  Thaila nd–were buoye d by
signs of recovery in the high-tech sector and indications that the impac t of the SARS

percent rate this quarter but nominal GDP  growth shaping up to be 2½  pe rcent, M2

changes  in rel ative returns on some c omponents of  the agg regat e.  In parti cular , the

Policy Al ternati ves
(8) Recent financial develop ments and  the passage of a sizable tax cut over
the intermeet ing per iod have  creat ed a more suppor tive outlook f or aggre gate de mand
in the staff p rojection , but data  on inflatio n hav e mo stly run to  the soft sid e of staff
expecta tions.  In th e Gre enbo ok, the staff n ow a ssum es that the  FOMC will trim its
target by ¼ pe rcentage point and then subsequently keep it unchanged.  At t he same
time, the level of stock prices has been raised and tho se of the dollar and long -term
interest rates lower ed in re cognit ion of t heir r espec tive net movements  over t he
intermee ting per iod.  The st aff also has  incorpor ated the  grea ter fiscal stimulus
embodied in t he rec ently enact ed tax c ut than ha d been ant icipated i n the pri or
Greenb ook.  Thus, wh ile incoming da ta have mo ved real GD P grow th dow n a notch
over the first half, real growth over the next six quarters has been  raised nearly ½
percentage point--to 4¼  percent over the second  half of 2003 and 5¼  percent over
2004.    This f aster advanc e in produc tion i s expec ted to  speed t he decl ine in the
unemployment r ate ne xt ye ar, which fa lls to 5. 4 perce nt by l ate 20 04.  Giv en the
genera lly lower- than- expect ed pric e data  of la te, core PCE infl ation in the  second
quarter has been trim med a b it, implying that four-quarter inflation by this measu re
will come i n at 1 pe rcent over this year.  Co re inflation is projected to edg e down
further in 2 004, large ly bec ause s lack in la bor and produc t market s pers ists thro ugh
next yea r.  
(9) The st aff outl ook pr esents a pic ture of an eco nomy movi ng towa rds, but
not yet  attaining,  equil ibrium:  While the re is still some slac k in l abor market s, the
growth of real GDP is above that of i ts potenti al, and both i nflati on and the real
feder al funds rat e are a t unusual ly low level s.  To e xamine l onger- term st rategies for
monetary p olicy as the se dyna mic im balanc es adjust, th ree scena rios we re created  with
the ai d of the  FRB/US m odel.   The Greenbook f orecas t is exte nded throug h 2008 by
8
making several jud gmen tal adjustments to the m odel that preserve the central features
of the staff outlook.  In particular, trend mu ltifactor productivity is assumed to climb
steadily at alm ost 1½  percen t per year , which  com bined  with a  modest pick up in
capital d eepen ing from  its curren t pace im plies po tential G DP is expan ding a t a
roughly  3¾ percent  rate later in t he decade .  The nat ural r ate of  unemployment
remains close t o 5 percent–the st aff’s current l ong-run estimate.   The unified feder al
budget i s proj ected to set tle into a  deficit of about  2 perce nt of nomina l GDP.  The
demand for U. S. expor ts is bols tered by 4 perc ent annua l real depre ciation of t he
dolla r, as well  as the  gradual  recove ry of t he world ec onomy, so a s to ca p the cur rent
accou nt deficit rela tive to no minal GD P at a little ov er 5 perc ent.
(10) The dynamics  of the  FRB/US m odel hav e the pr operty  that,  given t he
forces pla ying o ut in the  staff forecast, the C ommittee h as consid erable tim e before  it
needs t o real ign the  curren t unusual ly low real f ederal  funds r ate to its gradual ly rising
equil ibrium value.   Three al terna tive simulat ions wer e run to e xamine the
conseq uence s for the ec onomy a nd lon g-run  inflation o f varying  degree s of delay in
beginning the p rocess of realigning the federal funds rate.  In particular, these
scenarios en vision t he co nseq uence s of moving  the r eal funds  rate to i ts long- run
equilibrium leve l of a bout 2¾ percent relatively smoothly over th e course of one year. 
The simu lations differ according to when  the Com mittee is assumed to  start
tightening–either 2005, 2006, or 2007.  Th ese simulations, shown  in Chart 6, indicate,
quite o bviou sly, that the lo nger th e Co mmittee waits to  tighten, th e mo re will
unem ploym ent be w orked  dow n and  inflation u ltimately ste p up .  We re policy  to
begin  moving th e real fun ds rate u p in 20 05, show n by th e solid line  in the u pper left
panel, the  unem ploym ent rate w ould stay close to  5 percen t after 2004  (the m iddle

(11) With regar d to th e imm ediate ch oice of p olicy, if the C ommittee b oth
shares the staff assessment that prospective slack in resource use could  foster 
disinflation a nd views t he curr ent inflation r ate a s already on t he low si de, it may fa vor
a 25 basis poi nt reduct ion in the intended federal fund s rate.  Such a policy mo ve,
by pre serving m uch o f the recen t rally in finan cial ma rkets, wo uld p rovide  supp ort to
aggregate demand, there by helping to counter any t endency toward further s ubstantial
disinflation,  which the  Comm ittee announc ed would be unwel come in it s statement
after the  May meeting.   This bene fit to the  economy may be s een as  coming at a  low
cost,  in that an unwanted upsurge in inf lation may be viewed as unli kely in an
environment in which the level  of output lies  well below that of i ts est imated potential
and inflat ion expectati ons remain subdued.  Indeed, i nflati on expectations may have
ticked l ower of late,  necessi tating a moderate downward adjustment of the nominal
rate to kee p the re al intere st rate from risi ng.  Shoul d the ac tion pr ove to be
unnecessary, it could readily be unw ound b efore any material harm  is done.  And  even
if inflation picked up a bit, the Com mittee migh t see that rise as desirable to increase
the si ze of t he cushi on agains t the  possi bility of  having t o approach  the zer o bound
on the nom inal federal funds rate.  Indeed, the alternative long-run scenarios suggest
that the Com mittee may b e able to hold the no minal fund s rate near 1 percent for a
consi derabl e peri od of ti me without put ting s ignificant  upward pres sure on i nflation.
(12) Alternativel y, the Committee may find the cas e for a 50 bas is po int cut
in the funds rat e to a level  of 75 basis  points to be pers uasive.   The Com mittee may
wish to push harder against  the persis tent substa ntial output gap,  which the staf f has

Com mittee agrees  with the Greenbook assessment of t he economy, it may belie ve that
the pro jected inflatio n rate w ould be un comfortably lo w giv en the p roblem s likely to
emer ge if the eco nom y were  to exp erience ad verse sho cks and  the zero  bou nd w ere to
become an important constraint on poli cy.  In t his regard,  the Comm ittee may believe
that a 50 basis point cut in the fund s rate could be taken back  later, if  need be, at less

consequences of an  unchang ed funds rate as the  best t hat ar e fea sible, given the  lags

unemployment rate than the staf f fores ees.  Especi ally with t he mounting fiscal
stimulus evidently in train, the Com mittee may an ticipate that a reduction in mo netary
accommod ation will be c alled f or in the not-t oo-distant f uture, and another e ase at
this meeting would make such a tightening action more sizable than otherwise. 
Instead, the Co mmi ttee may  wish to continue to await mor e readings on the economy
collected aft er the  Iraq war be fore r econsi dering  the nee d for any  further eas ing
action.

Direct ive and As sessment  of Ri sks
(14) From  Janua ry 2000  to Janu ary 2003 , the Co mmittee sum marized its
views o n the risk s to the atta inment of its go als of m axim um sustaina ble econ omic
growth an d price stability in terms of a single sentence–the “balance-o f-risks”
assessment.  In M arch, the Com mittee dropp ed this sentence from the p ress
statem ent in ligh t of the elev ated un certainties su rroun ding its o utlook  associated  with
the loo ming onse t of war .  The “b alance-o f-risks” lang uage w as refined  in M ay, with
the press release including a three-part assessment of the eco nom y that characterized
the ri sks indivi duall y surr ounding the  outlook f or the g rowth of a ctivity and inf lation,
as well  as the ir joint c onsequenc es for the ba lance  of ri sks to achie ving t he
Committee’s go als. 
(15) The experience since the M ay 6th announ cement sug gests that the three-
part risk a ssessme nt served  the C ommittee’s inte rests well, in th at the pu blic qu ickly
came to under stand t he Federa l Reser ve’s conce rns about  additi onal di sinflation
without bui lding a larm about  the pros pects  for ec onomic growth.   By depart ing fr om
the routinized w ords of the prior balan ce-of-risk statement, the three-point risk
assessm ent w as wid ely seen as m eshing  more effectively w ith the rest o f the statem ent.
Moreover,  going f orward,  the t hree- part a ssessment would pr ovide br oader cov erage
of the range of possible ou tcomes for the econ omy than  the earlier language,
sugges ting t hat the  Comm ittee would not  be under pr essur e anyt ime soon t o amend
the form of the statem ent significantly.
(16)  While the Committe e revi ewed the wordi ng of the  release in advance  of
the policy vot e in May, it f ormally voted on only the l evel of t he intended federa l
funds rate, as will be noted in the m inutes of that meeting to b e released on Thu rsday,
June 26th.  In the past, the memb ers of the Com mittee appear to h ave been satisfied
with the practice of routinely review ing the public announcement after the policy vote.

Assuming that  the Committee  would pref er to r eturn t o incl uding an as sessment of
the risks to  its outloo k in its vote  witho ut review ing the s tatem ent befo rehan d, it could
opt to vote both on the directive and the three-part risk assessment presented below. 
To retain flexibility, the language of  the as sessment of ri sks be low convey s the
direction of each of the three parts w ithout specifying the exact word ing of the three
relevant sen tences o f the  announcement. 
(1) Dir ective Wording
The Federal Open M arket Committee seeks monetary and fi nancial
cond itions tha t will foster p rice stability an d pro mote sustaina ble gro wth
in output .  To fur ther i ts long-run obj ectives, the Committee  in the
imm ediate futu re seeks co ndition s in reserve  mar kets con sistent w ith
main taining/I NCREASING/REDUCING the f ederal funds rate at/TO
an aver age of  around ___ 1-1/4  percen t.
(2) Ris k Assess ment
The Comm ittee des ires that i ncluded i n the of ficial announcement
released af ter the meeti ng (but not  included in t he dire ctive) be  the
indications that, against the backgroun d of its long-run goals of price
stabi lity and sus tainable e conomic growt h and of t he inf ormation
curren tly available : The risks to  its outloo k for susta inable ec onomic
growth over the next several quarters [ARE WEI GHTED TOWARD
THE DOWNSIDE]   [are balanced] [ARE WEI GHTED TOWARD
THE  UPSID E]; the ri sks to it s outlook for i nflati on over the next
several quarters [are weighted toward the downs ide]  [ARE
BALA NCE D] [ARE W EIGHTE D TO WARD TH E UPSIDE ]; and,
taken together, the balance of risks to its objectives  [are weighted
toward the downs ide]  [ARE B ALANCED]  [ARE WEI GHTED
TOWARD THE UPS IDE ] in the foreseeable future.

Market Reaction and Monetary and Credit Aggre gates
(17) Under an y of the th ree po licy alternativ es, the Co mmittee ma y elect to
retain t he current st ructure and content of  its as sessment of t he two component risks
and thei r bala nce over all.  It may again j udge that  equal r isks of a s hortf all or
overs hoot in r eal economic growt h, combine d with downsi de ris ks for  inflation,
would  balance out overall risks to the dow nside for the foreseeable future.   In
additio n to th e assessm ent of th e risks, ma rket par ticipants w ill pay close a ttention  to
the wordi ng of the  rest of the  announcement,  espec ially for any hi nts that the
Committee considers the likelihood of d eflation to b e anything other th an quite low. 
In that re gard, som e repo rts sugg est the exp ectation th at a 50 b asis poin t mo ve wo uld
be accompanied by an explanation of t he Com mittee’ s plan for t he alternat ive
implementation of polic y, potenti ally i ncluding a rate t arget for a  maturity longer t han
overn ight.
(18) With market pa rticipant s predi cting that  an eas ing is  likely at this meeting
and that a redu ction of 50 basis points is mo re probable than  one of 25 basis points,
the market react ion would be most pronounced if the FOM C were to decide to stay
on h old.  G iven tha t the ou tlook fo r corpo rate earn ings w ith an u nchan ged fu nds rate
would be less b uoyan t than m arket pa rticipants e xpect, a sto ck price d ecline w ould
follow such a decision.  U nless this decline were quite large, some back up in long-term
interest rates would likely be associated with the sizable rise in short-term interest
rates.  An  easing m ove of 2 5 basis p oints w ould have so me o f these effects, albeit
more m uted.  By contrast, a 50 basis point reduction  would  be larger than expected
and could  induce initial increases in stock and bon d prices.  Such a cut cou ld cause
financial  distress for s ome higher- cost money  market mutual  funds an d also mig ht
begin to rais e market concerns about the r emaining scope for f urther conventional
mon etary policy stimulus.  Indeed, longer-term T reasuries might be b id up in price
15
over time as m arket participants come increasingly to an ticipate large-scale purchases
by the Federal R eserve.
(19) The G reenb ook a ssum ption o f a 25 basis p oint easin g, com bined  with its
projectio n of no minal GD P gro wth a t a 5 perc ent rate o ver the sec ond half of this
year,  probably  would induce  M2 growth of 7½ perce nt over  the sa me period.   The
implie d decli ne in M2 veloc ity of 2½ perce nt fol lows an e stimated drop of  4 perce nt
over th e first half of th is year.  O n a per iod-en d basis, do mestic n onfina ncial deb t is
expect ed to ex pand at a  pace of  7½ percent  over t he sec ond half  of thi s yea r.  The
federal debt  component wou ld grow at an annual rate of  10½ percent, and nonfederal
sector de bt is projected to record a g rowt h rate of 6 ¾ perc ent over the next two
quarters, paced  by the e xpan sion of h ome mo rtgage d ebt.
