Prefatory Note  
 
 
The attached document represents the most  complete and accurate version available 
based on original copies culled from the f iles of the FOMC Secretariat at the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve Syst em.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization proce ss which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain. 
 Please note that some material may have b een redacted from this document if that 
material was received on a confidential ba sis.  Redacted material is indicated by 
occasional gaps in the text or by gray boxe s around non-text content.  All redacted

1  In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic 
format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to rem ove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing). 
 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optical character recognition computer program (OCR) 
first created electronic text from the document im age.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, 
staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.  Pl ease note that the numbers and text in charts and 
tables were not reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff.

(1) The FOM C’s dec ision to le ave i ts target  for t he fede ral funds rat e and 
assessment of risks unchan ged at the A ugust m eeting was widely an ticipated, but rates
on m oney m arket futu res for the  second  half of ne xt year m oved  5 to 10 b asis poin ts
lower as market parti cipants appare ntly took part icular note of  the stat ement that
“policy accommodation can be maintained for a considerable period.”1  Over
subseq uent w eeks, econ omic data relea ses poin ted to a su bstantial stre ngthe ning in
aggregate dem and, and these futures rates m oved app reciably higher.  In recent days,
however, those increases w ere more than  reversed when  upward ly revised
productivity  data, conti nued weakness in employment, and comments by Federal
Reserve officials strengthened m arket participants’ conviction that the stance of policy
would  be left unchanged  for some tim e.  On net ov er the intermeeting period , near-

now imply an expectation of about 2½ percentage point s of tight ening from mid-2004
to end -2005 (C hart 1).

August, alt hough fails-t o-deliver,  while down considerably in recent  weeks, remain elevated
on cert ain se curit ies.  The volat ility of  longer -term yiel ds over t he int ermeeti ng peri od
seemed to owe in part to variat ions in mortgage-r elated hedging demands.  As one example,
the announc ement by Fanni e Mae in mid-August  that  the dur ation of it s ass ets exceeded t he
durat ion of i ts liabilities by  more than market  part icipants  had expect ed was accompanie d by
sizable increas es in Tr easur y and swap yi elds, likely reflecting invest ors’ expect ations tha t the

but, on net, the flattening of the near-term path o f policy expectations was associated
with declines in Treasury co upon yields of 5 to 10  basis points.2  The yield on ten-y ear
Treasury indexed debt f ell the s ame amou nt as its  nominal counterpart,  implying that
inflation compensat ion hel d stea dy, a s did s urvey meas ures of  longer -term infl ation

credit demands of nonfinanci al firms remain modest.  The debt of nonfinancia l
busin esses is on tr ack to g row at a 3½  percen t rate in the  third q uarter.  W hile this rate
is only half that posted in the second q uarter, that earlier performance had b een
boosted by borrowing by many firms beyond immediate funding needs to take
advan tage of th e lowe st bon d yields in  decad es.  Bon d issuan ce slow ed abr uptly in  July

paper edging up and C& I loans posti ng further decl ines.  As rates on resi dential

August, bu t the pac e of such  activity sub seque ntly plu nged .  Mo rtgage d ebt gro wth

household debt is expect ed to grow at a 9 percent ra te in the t hird quarter.   Federal

Policy Al ternati ves
(7)  The data r eleased ove r the i ntermeet ing per iod on spe nding and
producti vity surpas sed expe ctations,  leadi ng the s taff both t o stre ngthen t he
Greenbook f orecas t for real GDP growth and to widen s omewhat its  estimate of t he
outp ut gap  in recen t years and  going  forwa rd.  Th e Gre enbo ok fore cast con tinues to
be predicated on the as sumption that the FOM C holds the federal f unds rate at
1 percent throug h the first half of 2005 before firming policy a bit.  Long er-term
interest rates a re expe cted to d ecline m odestly n ext year as in vestors g radua lly
recognize that t he Federal Reserve wil l not tight en monetary policy as s oon or as
much  as is currently built into the yield curve.  Equity prices again are pro jected to rise
over t ime, a lbeit from a higher ba se tha n in the  August Greenbook,  providi ng
investors with risk-adjusted returns in line w ith those on fix ed-income instruments. 
The foreign exchange val ue of the dollar , once agai n, edges l ower.  With financial
condit ions,  fiscal pol icy, and acce lerator dyna mics suppor tive of econ omic expans ion,
real GDP growth is proj ected to ri se to a  4½ percent  rate over t he sec ond half  of
2003 an d to 5 p ercent in  2004.  In 2 005, a shift in fisca l policy fro m co nsidera ble
stimulus to slight restraint contributes to a m oderation of g rowth to about 4 p ercent, a
little above t he est imated r ate of  expansi on of pote ntial output .  This  perfor mance of
real out put i s expected to  pull the c ivilian une mploymen t rate do wn to ab out
5¼ p ercent by the end o f the projection period.  Because eco nom ic slack persists over
the f orecas t interval , under lying infl ation slips lower , with core PCE inf lation edging
below 1 percent in 2005. 
(8) Although si gnificant unc ertainties about  the out look re main, t he tenor  of
recent spending dat a presumably has bolste red Comm ittee memb ers’ confidence that
the economic expansion now under way will be suffi cient to re duce the risk of  an
unwelcome dec line in inf lation.  If  so, t he Committee might  elect to leave the stance
6
of policy unchanged  at this m eeting.   Ind eed, the C ommittee m ight find  both
plausible a nd attracti ve the Greenbook projection t hat infl ation remains fa irly s table at
around 1  percent, which m ay be seen as consistent with a w orking definition of price
stabi lity.  Alt ernat ively, the Committee might  be conce rned about  risks tha t inflation
could m ove higher either becau se it sees the current stance of policy as likely to foster
a more substantial  pickup in spending or because i t views the outl ook for struct ural
productivity  or for the sust ainable le vel of res ource utili zation as le ss favora ble than
does the staf f.  Financi al market quotes,  which appear to be conditioned on an
expectation of no further p olicy easing and som e unwind ing of current policy
accommodati on nex t year, might  be re ad as  indicating that inves tors expect the o utput
gap to close rapidly.  In these circumstan ces, the Com mittee migh t feel most
comfortable assessing incom ing data to determ ine whether further ad justments in fact
will be necessary to return aggreg ate production to  its potential at an acceptable pace.
(9) Should the  Comm ittee, by contr ast, find t he Greenbook a ssessment
plausi ble but  wish to make  more rapi d progres s agai nst ec onomic sl ack or ha rbor
concer ns that  1 perce nt inf lation is al ready t oo low, i t might c hoose t o ease p olicy by
25 ba sis po ints at this meeti ng.  The Comm ittee might be especial ly troubled t hat
persistenc e of the alr eady-p rotracted  sluggish ness in th e labor m arket co uld
undermine hous ehold conf idence  and spendi ng and cal l into questi on the
sustainability of the expansion.  Although further easing wo uld affect the economy
only wit h a lag,  such ac tion woul d almost c ertainly help t o boost ag gregat e demand
and em ploym ent nex t year.  A long th ose lines, a p olicy easin g might be w arranted  to
bring t he act ual re al federal  funds r ate c loser to, or even be low, t he lower e nd of the
estimated range of  its equil ibrium values,  as it was i n late 2001 and much of 2002
(Chart 4).  Even if the pace o f output grow th forecast in the Greenb ook were seen

cost of err ing on the side of pol icy accommodation as small at t his time given t hat
inflation is low and inflation expectations are w ell anchored.  If Com mittee mem bers
viewed the prevailing inflation rate as already close to the low er end of their preferred

be seen as desirable to limit the risk of disinflation and possibly even to  foster a higher

Policy Announc ement , Dir ective, and Ass essment o f Risks
(10) Independe nt of t he deci sion on t he sta nce of p olicy at t his meet ing, the
announcement wi ll, as usua l, be scr utini zed clos ely by  market pa rticipant s for
implic ations about t he fut ure cours e of pol icy.  If the Committee de cides  to le ave the
stanc e of pol icy unc hanged,  it pr esumably  will want to not e the e ncouragi ng flow of
incom ing da ta over th e interm eeting p eriod, inclu ding th e indicatio ns of a
strengtheni ng of final  demands— particula rly those f or capital  goods— as well as
contin ued im pressive p rodu ctivity gro wth.  In  contra st, should  the C ommittee e lect to
ease policy, it might point particularly to the ongo ing sluggishness in labor m arket
perfor mance, s trong pr oducti vity, and t he potent ial implic ations of t hose f actor s for
further dis inflation.
(11) The C ommittee’s d iscussion  of its com munication s policy th at is
scheduled for Monday evening might affe ct how it str uctures its a ssessment of risks. 
Howeve r, rather tha n preju dge th e outco me o f that session , it is assume d in this
Blueb ook th at the cu rrent for m of the risk assessm ent is retain ed, at least for th is
meeting.   The next t hree par agraphs  disc uss pos sible adjus tments t o the as sessment
within the current  framework.
(12) Even though t he Greenbook out put for ecast has be en revi sed up and 
data n ow se em to  point fa irly conv incingly  to a stren gthen ing pa th of eco nom ic
activity, t he Co mmittee might still judge that the “. . . risk s to th e atta inment of sustainable
8
economic grow th over the  next several quarters a re balanced.”  In vie w of the upwar d revi sion
to estimated grow th of potential GD P, a considerable outpu t gap remains likely for a
time.   If the Committee vi ews the p hrase  “sust ainabl e economic  growth” as  consi stent
with above-trend  expansion ov er the next several quarters as that gap is closed rather
than denoting the economy’s pote ntial growth rat e, then i t may regard the odds of an
undershoo ting or o versho oting o f its grow th ob jective as ab out b alanced .  In contr ast,
if sustai nable e conomic growt h were re ad as meani ng the r ate of  expansi on of
potential output, the C omm ittee might be inclined to indicate that the risks were tilted
to the u pside.  H owever, if the C ommittee r eached  that con clusion , it may w ant to
make cle ar in t he announce ment that  even i f growth a bove pote ntial were r ealized,
policy tightening would not automatically be triggered in the near fu ture. 
(13) If the Com mittee still attached a significant probability to pronoun ced
downward press ures on pr ices—a judgment that woul d tend t o be rei nforce d by the
curren t very low  rate of inflatio n and  the likeliho od th at consid erable slack  will
persist— especially g iven the  recent ev idence o f continu ed rob ust pro ductivity
grow th— and sa w suc h an o utcom e as especia lly costly, it mig ht con tinue to  indicate
that “. . . the probability, though minor, of an u nwelcom e fall in inflation exceeds that of a rise in
inflation from  its alr eady low level.”   The Com mittee would presumably opt to stat e that
the risks to  its outloo k for inflatio n over  the nex t several q uarters a re balan ced on ly if
it saw the ev ident  strengtheni ng of aggr egate  demand in rec ent week s as put ting
sufficient pres sures on resource s to have great ly reduced the chance s of an
unwelcome subs tantial fall in inf lation.
(14) If the Com mittee were to decid e to retain the judgm ents that it reached
in August regard ing the r isks on o utpu t and in flation ind ividually, it w ould seem  to
follow  logically th at the ov erall assessm ent aga in wo uld b e that the  dow nside risk s to
inflation were li kely to predomina te for the f orese eable  futur e.  However , the
9
Com mittee migh t decide to alter its assessment of the output or inflation risks in view
of the  economic da ta and f inanci al dev elopments  over t he int ermeeti ng peri od.  The
simple st situation would occ ur if the Committee  conclude s that  the ri sks to infl ation,
as well as t he risks t o growth, are now balanced.  I n that case,  the overall  risks
presumabl y would be s een as  balanc ed.  I f, instead, the Committee  deter mined not
only that the risks to inflation were now  balanced bu t the risks to output had sh ifted
to the  upside , then the ov erall risks woul d seem to be  to the  upside .  But i f the
Comm ittee conc luded t hat the  risks to i nflation r emained t o the downsi de, e ven as t he
risks to s ustai nable gr owth had moved to t he upsi de, the bott om-line  asse ssment
would be more compli cated.  It s deci sion on t he overa ll balance —skewed to the
upside , balanced,  or ske wed to the  downside—would depend on i ts views both of  the
relative probabilities and of the econom ic costs attached to the various outco mes.  In
any cas e, regardl ess of  the Fede ral Res erve’ s intentions rega rding t he meaning of  the
risk ass essment , a shift would li kely be int erpre ted by i nvest ors as  providi ng
information ab out the next chan ge in the stance of policy.
(15) Another is sue f or Committee c onside ration at thi s meeti ng rel ates to the
indicati on in the announcement following the August meeting that  “In these
circumstances, the  Committee b elieves that polic y acco mmodation can be m aintained for  a con siderable
period.”  The c ombinatio n of de velopm ents ov er the inte rmee ting per iod— especially
the juxtapos ition of an appa rent s trengt hening of  aggrega te demand wit h a see ming
further acc eleration in product ivity that  had the ne t effect of wideni ng somewhat t he
staff’s proj ection of the  output ga p—m ight be  viewed a s warra nting t he rei teration of
such a s tatement.  However , the Committee might  not be conv inced t hat re cent
trends in producti vity are  likel y to persis t, and thus i t may see a good possibil ity that
polic y will  need to be  firmed sooner t han ass umed in the Gree nbook fore cast, perhaps
along  the lines in dicated  by futu res rates.  Th e Co mmittee presu mably will w ant to
10
remove the statement from the announcement in advance of any policy tightening. 
Howeve r, dropp ing it at this p oint w ould likely pro mpt an ad verse reac tion in
financia l markets,  including not the l east a backup in i nterest  rates.   An alternative
approach woul d be to condi tion t he sta tement on e conomic deve lopments .  For
example,  the Committee  could i ndicat e that  “. . . pol icy accommodation l ikely can be
main tained fo r the con siderab le period  that the C ommittee e xpects w ill be requ ired to
achieve sa tisfactory eco nom ic perform ance.”  R ates cou ld back  up so me ev en in th is
case if investors read the language as an effort by the C omm ittee to take a step back
from what had been regarded as an implicit  comm itment to hold the ta rget rate  at
1 perce nt for  a lengt hy peri od.
(16) Should th e Co mmittee wish  to follow  the sam e proc edure  as in A ugust,
it could vote  on the di rective a nd on languag e provi ding gui dance t o the dra fters of
the announc ement reg arding t he ris k ass essment .  Draf t language wit h a range  of
options is p rovided below. 
(1) Dir ective Wording
The Federa l Open Market Committee  seeks  monetary a nd
financial co ndition s that w ill foster price sta bility and  prom ote
sustainabl e growth i n output.   To furthe r its long- run objec tives, the
Committee in the im mediate future  seeks con ditions in  reserve m arkets
consiste nt with maintaining/INCRE ASIN G/R EDU CING  the federal
funds r ate a t/TO an average  of around ___ 1 percen t.
(2) Ris k Assess ment
Against t he backgr ound of it s long- run goals  of pri ce stability and
sustainable econom ic growth and  of the information cu rrently available,
the C ommittee b elieves the risk s to its ou tlook fo r sustaina ble econ omic
growth over the next several quarters [ARE WEI GHTED TOWARD

several quarters [are weighted toward the downs ide] [ARE
BALA NCE D] [ARE W EIGHTE D TO WARD TH E UPSIDE ]; and,
taken together, the balance of risks to its objectives [are weighted toward
the downside] [ARE B ALANCED]  [ARE WEI GHTED TOWARD
THE UPSID E] in the foreseeable future.
Market Reaction
(17) Market par ticipant s unif ormly expe ct no cha nge in t he sta nce of
monetary pol icy at this meeti ng, and on ly a f ew anti cipat e an al teration i n the
assess ment of risks.   Accordingly, a s tatement that t he target f ederal funds ra te was
being l eft at 1 per cent,  that t he ris ks to s ustai nable gr owth were bal anced,  that t he
prob ability of a fall in  inflation still ex ceeded  that of a rise , and tha t on b alance th is
risk to inflatio n rem ained th e dom inant co ncern  of the C ommittee w ould likely
provoke litt le market reac tion.  Coupling an unchanged stance of  policy with an
assessment e ither that  the ri sks to growth were  now til ted to  the upsi de or tha t the
risks to inflation were now b alanced could p romp t an appreciable rise in market
interes t rates  if that  assess ment led investors  to conclude that a t ightening was not fa r
off. 
(18) A decision to ea se policy at this meeting wo uld catch investors
completely unawares.  Sho rt-term in terest rates would likely fall by about the same
amou nt as the reduction in the federal fund s rate.  Intermediate-term rates should also
decline, bu t the effect on  long-ter m yield s is less certain.  N ominal bo nd rate s could
tend to rise  if inves tors took the move as addit ional evidence  that the Federal  Reserve
was purpose fully adopti ng polic ies to bri ng about hi gher i nflation.   In thi s cas e, the
foreign  exchan ge valu e of the d ollar w ould most likely declin e, but the e ffect on eq uity
12
prices i s unclear.   If, however, market parti cipants t hought instead that  the move was
intend ed to co mbat econ omic cond itions tha t were w eaker th an they  had p reviou sly
appre ciated, bo nd yield s, the excha nge va lue of th e dollar, an d equ ity prices all w ould
be likely to decline.
Mon etary and Credit Agg regates
(19) Growth in M2 is proj ected to dece lerate in coming months under  the
assumption s of the Greenb ook forecast.  With a flat funds rate, the effects of past
mon etary policy easings in buoying M 2 are expected to ebb .  In addition, the sharp
drop-of f in mort gage re financing ac tivity shoul d show through t o a slowi ng in the
growth of l iquid de posit s.  As a  resul t, M2 growth avera ges about  4 perce nt from
August through December, bringing growth for 2003 to around 7½ percent. 
Projec ted growt h in thi s aggre gate dur ing 2004 , at 5½ percent , remains a bi t below
expan sion of n ominal inco me, as o pportunity co sts are abo ut flat and  as the bo ost to
liquid deposi ts associated wi th mortgag e refinanci ngs abat es further .  Thus,  the
four-yea r slide in M 2 velocity is fo recast to co me to  an end  next yea r.  M2  grow th
then sl ows furt her in 2 005 as  the adva nce in nomin al income moderate s and
short-term interest rates begin to edge h igher.
(20) The g rowth of do mestic n onfina ncial secto r debt is a lso pro jected to
decrease  in com ing m onth s.  The falloff im portan tly reflects a dec eleration  in
household  debt, as a d ecline in m ortgag e borro wing  is only p artly offset by  a picku p in
consu mer c redit.  In 20 04 and  2005, ho useho ld bor rowing co ntinue s significantly
below its rec ent pace,  but remains a lit tle above the r ate of expansi on of nominal
GDP.  Despite s omewhat str onger busi ness i nvest ment, bor rowing by f irms re mains
relatively slug gish ov er the ne xt several m onth s, as the finan cing ga p stays relativ ely
narrow bec ause of  a furt her improve ment in prof its.  However,  busine ss debt
accel erates somewhat  over t he next  two year s as c apital ex pendit ures pi ck up and
13
grow th in pr ofits lags.  O verall do mestic n onfina ncial secto r debt is p rojected  to
expand 8¼ perc ent in 2003 and t hen to s low to 7 pe rcent  and 6 perc ent in 2004 and
2005, respectively.
