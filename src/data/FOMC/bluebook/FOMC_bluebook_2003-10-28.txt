Prefatory Note  
 
 
The attached document represents the most  complete and accurate version available 
based on original copies culled from the f iles of the FOMC Secretariat at the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve Syst em.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization proce ss which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain. 
 Please note that some material may have b een redacted from this document if that

format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to rem ove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing). 
 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optical character recognition computer program (OCR) 
first created electronic text from the document im age.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, 
staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.  Pl ease note that the numbers and text in charts and

The Recent Stability of Ne ar-Term Policy Expectations  
The Committee’s recent announcements as well as comments by Federal
Reserve officials have hinted strongly–most explicitly in Chairman Greenspan’smonetary policy testimony in July and in the concluding sentence of the August and
September FOMC statements–that the stance of policy would remainaccommodative for some time.  These statem ents seem to have left investors quite
confident that the target funds rate will remain near 1 percent for the next few
months.  For example, an estimate of uncertainty about the near-term policy path
derived from options data–shown in the le ft panel of the chart–has fallen sharply
over the summer and remains near historic al lows.  The efficacy of the Committee’s
statements in anchoring near-term policy expectations has also been suggested by
movements of near- and longer-dated futures rates.  The right panel plots dailychanges in the eurodollar futures rate eight quarters ahead on the vertical axis
against the corresponding daily changes in the three-month-ahead federal funds
futures rate.  The solid black regression line shows the average relationship betweenthese variables over the entire period from 1990 to the present.  The red dashed
line shows the regression line fitted with data since the Chairman’s testimony inJuly; the significantly steeper slope of this line is consistent with the view that near-
term policy expectations have been unus ually stable over recent months.  This
conclusion holds even when a more recent period–the year ended June 2003 (theblue dot-dashed line)–is used as the basis for comparison.

Monetar y policy is still assu med to be o n ho ld un til mid-2 005 an d to firm  only

5-1/4 percent rate over th e sec ond half of 2003 and at nearly that pace in 2004.  A
swing in fiscal policy toward restraint in 2005 contributes to a mo deration o f GD P

shift largely refl ects two fact ors.  First , the staff’s estimate of  four-qua rter core  PCE inflat ion
for last quart er has  incre ased about  10 basis  points  since  the l ast Bluebook, r educing t he

place  the re al federal  funds r ate be low the r ange of  equil ibrium values de rived from
variou s staff mo dels (C hart 5).7  Even  if the Co mmittee is conc erned  that eco nom ic
slack could pe rsist for a subs tantial time, it  might thi nk that  any addi tiona l easing
undertaken  at this m eeting w ould not– given th e lags w ith wh ich po licy affects

Committee ma y see less reso urce slack  curren tly or be m ore w orried th at very rap id

 Note: The estimates of the equilibrium real funds rate based on Treasury inflation-indexed securities have been revised
 to cover a period from five to ten years ahead rather than ten to thirty years ahead.  The estimates based on the FRB/US model have been revised to take account of changes to the model and to the details of the method used.  In all of these
 cases, the values shown for the September Bluebook are on the new basis, and so they differ from the value actually shown

facilitated i f Committee members  conveyed t heir vi ews about t he possi ble wordi ng of t he
second par agraph of  the s tatement to t he Secret ary in advance of t he meeti ng.  The
September 16  policy ann ouncemen t is provide d in t he Appendi x.  information on aggregate demand and supply before adjusting policy further.    
(10) If, howe ver, the C ommittee is co ncern ed that g rowth m ay not r emain
rapid e nough to re turn outp ut to i ts pot ential reasonabl y promptly  and so li mit any
further d ecline in in flation, then  it migh t choo se to  cut t he tar get f or the fe deral
fund s rate b y 25 b asis p oints  at thi s meeti ng.  While  the Committee  may be
convinced that the eco nom y has been grow ing robustly and w ill continue to do so
over th e remainder of th is year, it may fe ar th at th e expansion could sputter in 2004. 
In particular, firms may rem ain cautious in their spending , hiring, and inventory
control, implyi ng cont inued res traint on agg regate de mand gro wth as  the i mpetus
from  this sum mer’s tax  cuts ebb s.  Even  if the Co mmittee thinks th at the m ost likely
outcome is one in which output growth is suff icient t o reduce resource s lack at an
acceptable pace, it might wan t to err on the side of m ore accom mod ative policy given
that inflatio n is low , inflation exp ectations  are app arently w ell ancho red, and  the costs
of a f urther  decli ne in i nflation l ikely outwei gh those  of a modest  incre ase.  Indeed,
Comm ittee members may s ee the  curren t level of  inflation as nea r the bot tom of the
range that they wo uld like to achieve in the longer term , given the asymm etries caused
by the zero lower bound on nom inal int erest r ates and other poss ible nominal
rigidities.  
Policy Announc ement , Dir ective, and Ass essment o f Risks8
(11) The wording of  the se cond parag raph of t he poli cy announc ement–the
porti on of the  announcement t hat prov ides a rat ional e for t he Committee’ s deci sion–
should pr esumably  reflect the judgments  about the  stanc e of moneta ry poli cy and
econom ic conditions that the C omm ittee makes in arriving at its policy decision.  If
9
9 “Committe e Discus sion of th e Wording o f the A nnouncement,”  memorand um to
the Committ ee from Vinc ent Reinha rt, dated Oct ober 2 2, 2003 .the Committee  decide s to make no c hange in  polic y, then it  may well want  to employ
languag e similar t o the st atement  issued fol lowing t he Septe mber meeting .  Such a
statem ent w ould note th at the acco mmodative  stance o f policy an d vigo rous g rowth
in product ivity are pr ovidi ng ongoing s upport t o economic a ctivity and that  incoming
data c ontinue  to show a f irming of  spendi ng.  I n light  of the  small r ise in employment
in Septem ber and the som ewhat low er levels of initial cl aims posted in recen t weeks,
the C ommittee m ay wa nt to n ote som e eviden ce of stabiliz ation in  labor m arkets
rather th an retaining the lan guage that “th e lab or m arket has been weakening.”
(12) Even  if the Co mmittee is persu aded b y the arg uments for ea sier policy, it
may still  want to start t he “rationale ” paragraph by noting that t he accommod ative
stance o f policy an d rob ust un derlying  grow th in pr oductivity are p rovidin g sup port to
economic a ctivity and by ack nowledging  the re cent s trengt h in spe nding.   The
statem ent cou ld then  justify a rate cu t by po inting to  conce rns abo ut the su stainability
of bri sk growt h or the e ffects of  faster structur al produc tivity growt h on est imates  of
econom ic slack.  The statement migh t also note that the costs of a significant further
decline in  inflation c ould be large  whe reas up side inflatio n risks seem  small, he lping to
tilt the balance in  favo r of easier policy.  
(13) This Blue book ass umes that  the st ructur e of t he thi rd parag raph of t he
statement summarizing the risks to the outlook follows that selected at recent FOMC
meetin gs–w ith the p ossible ex ception  of the fina l sentence , which  will be d iscussed in
paragraph 16.9  The fir st two sente nces s ummarize the r isks to the  outlook f or
econom ic growth and  for the rate of inflation over the next few qu arters, which
correspond to the rows and columns, res pectivel y, of Table  1.  If  the Comm ittee, like
the staff, sees ou tput gr owth  as likely to trim  the slack in  good s and fac tor m arkets

fairly slow ly in com ing qu arters, then it m ay again  judge  that “ ... the risks t o the
attainment of sustainable e conomic grow th over the  next several quarters a re balanced.”  Such an
assessm ent m ight reflect a v iew tha t the ph rase “su stainable  econo mic g rowth” is
consisten t with a bove-tr end ex pansio n over  the nex t several q uarters so  long a s it only
gradual ly closes t he output  gap.  Ret ention of thi s risk as sessment might al so fol low
from  an interp retation o f the ph rase that fo cused o n wh ether or  not th e grow th
process appeared to  be self-sustaining, especiall y if the Com mittee harbored
reservations that the expansion co uld falter early in 2004.  How ever, if the Comm ittee
view s “sustainable economic growth” as d enoting the growth rate of the  economy’s
potential to produ ce, then it might be inclined to ind icate that the risks are tilt ed
toward th e upsi de at t his meet ing.  Since s uch a st atement  might be mis read by t he
markets, the C ommittee m ay wa nt to m ake clear in  the ann ounceme nt that g rowth
above potential would not necessarily tr igger tighter p olicy in the near term.   
(14) If the Com mittee remains co ncerned that sub stantial downw ard
pressures on pri ces could accumulate and that  signif icantly  lower infla tion could prove
very costly, then it w ould likely indicate that, “...the probab ility, though  minor, of  an
unwelcome fall in inf lation excee ds that of a r ise in infl ation from its al ready low level .”  How ever,
such concerns m ay have eased considerab ly given the tenor of the spend ing data since
summer, an d, if the C ommittee b elieves that th e mo re rapid  grow th is not lik ely to
prove t ransi tory,  then i t might be  ready t o report  that t he ris ks to t he outl ook for
inflation over the next sev eral quarters are about balanced. 
(15) The al ternatives just discussed f or the first two  sent ence s admi t four
possi ble conf igurat ions,  as shown i n Table 1.   As it di d at the  September mee ting, the
Comm ittee might s ee the  risks to s ustai nable e conomic growt h as bal anced and t he
risk of a n unwel come f all in inflation as  outwei ghing tha t of a rise in inf lation ( the b lue
diagonally hat ched box in the table) .  In that  case it  would presumably conclude that
11
“... the r isk of infla tion becom ing undesirably low  remains the p redominant concern for the  forese eable
future.”  Altern atively, the C ommittee m ight assess th e risks to su stainable  grow th as to
the upsi de but re main conce rned about  an unwelcome f all in inf lation (the  yellow
horiz ontally h atched  box).  W ith the leve l of outp ut curr ently belo w estim ates of its
potential and inflation quite low , the Com mittee migh t believe that its dual goals are
more likely to b e jeopa rdized  by a furth er declin e in inflation  than b y plausib le
outcom es for growth in o utput.  In that case, it might continue to ind icate that the risk
of undesirably  low inflati on was predominant.  However, if the Committee feel s that
the p revailing d egree of econ omic s lack is relatively modes t and  thinks t hat o utput
growth could well pick up to a very  rapid pace,  then it might want to report  a neutral
balanc e of risks.  C onver sely, the C ommittee m ight still view  the risks to  sustaina ble
growth as  balanc ed, but  now belie ve that  the ri sks to infl ation are bal anced as  well ( the
red ver tically hatc hed box).   In that  case , it seems like ly that the  overal l assessment
also would be balanced.   Lastly,  if the i mprovement in growth prospects is see n as
sufficiently large, the Commit tee might  believe tha t the risks to sustainable output
growth are tilted to the up side, while the risks to inflation are balanced (the green
cross-ha tched b ox).  If so, it wo uld p resum ably ind icate that th e balan ce of risks is
weighted toward unsustainably rapid growth.     
(16) The fin al issue relatin g to the  policy an nouncem ent is wh ether to m odify
or delete the sentence “In these ci rcumstances, the  Com mittee belie ves that pol icy acc ommodation
can be m aintained for  a con siderable per iod.”  This choi ce pre sumably de pends upon t he
same considerati ons that underlie  the Comm ittee’s selection of the balance of  risks
statement.   If the Committee believe s either  that the growth of aggre gate demand may
slow n ext year fro m its seco nd-ha lf pace or  that the d egree o f slack in the  econo my is
currently c onsiderable and will  take ti me to work off, then i t might choose to repeat
its earlier st atement.  Such  a decision migh t be especially favored if the Com mittee
12
viewed the firm an choring of near-term  policy expectations that appears to h ave been
the ca se of  late as hel pful i n prevent ing market  parti cipant s from antici pating
substan tial policy tig htenin g in sho rt orde r.  How ever, with  the reco very seem ingly
gaining traction, the Com mittee migh t feel that tighter policy may well be needed
relatively soon to avoid a build-up  in inflation pressures.  Since the Com mittee
presumabl y will  want to r emove the s tatement in i ts cur rent f orm from the
announcement in advance of any policy t ightening,  it may judge that t he time has
come to al ter or  drop it .  Rela tively few market pa rticipant s repor tedly expec t the
latter deve lopment at  this meeting.   As a resul t, simply  dropping t he sent ence might
well lead investors to mo ve up the expected  timing of policy tightening co nsiderably,
prom pting a sizable reaction in financial mark ets.
(17) Even if  the Committee  does not  see c urrent  market e xpect ations for
polic y as unr easona ble, it might  be conce rned tha t, as ti me goes by,  repet ition of the
sentenc e wo uld lead  investor s to pu sh back  the date  at wh ich they e xpect tigh tening to
begin  beyon d the ra nge th at seem s plausib le to C ommittee m embers.  To av oid this
possib ility, the statem ent cou ld be m ade m ore clearly  cond itional o n futur e econ omic
develo pments.  For  exam ple, the C ommittee c ould indicate th at “. . . policy
accom modation  can be  maintain ed for the con siderab le period i t curren tly assesse s will be re quired to
foster the moderation of dis inflati onary pressures. ”  Even with t his modest  change i n wording,
interes t rates  would presumably rise some, si nce investor s would see the change as
increasing the likelihood of a tightening m ove in the not-too-distant future.
(18) Shou ld the Com mittee wish to follow  the same pro cedure as at the last
two m eetings, it cou ld vote o n the d irective an d on  langu age pro viding  guida nce to

Market Reaction
(19) Market participant s expect no change in t he stance of monetary pol icy at
this meeting, and generally do  not foresee an alteration in the three-sentence
assessment of  risks.  Thus, a n announcement t hat cl osely followed the  content  of the
September statement–that i s, an announcement that the  target f ederal funds ra te was
being l eft at 1 per cent,  that t he ris ks to s ustai nable gr owth were bal anced,  that t he
probabil ity of an unwel come fal l in inflation e xceeds  that of  a ris e, and that t he ris k of
14
undesirably l ow inflation re mained the predominant concern–would presumably have
minimal ef fects in f inanci al marke ts.  Given the  focus  of market  parti cipant s on the
overall asse ssmen t of the b alance o f risks, mark et reaction s wou ld likely be  quite
modest so long as the Comm ittee continued to point to undesi rably low infl ation as
the pred ominant co ncern , even if the an nouncem ent ind icated th at the risks to
sustainabl e growth were now to the upside.  If , however, t he Com mittee chose an
unch anged  policy stan ce but su ggested  that the r isks to its go als of sustain able
econ omic gr owth an d pri ce stability we re about e qual, inves tors woul d likely move up
their expec ted ti ming of pol icy tighte ning,  pushing i ntere st rates hi gher and t rimming
stock prices.      
(20) A decision to ease policy at th is meeting would surprise in vestors. 
Short- term int erest rates would f ollow t he fede ral funds rat e lower,  and
intermediate-term rates shou ld also decline.  If investors interpreted the easier policy
as reflecting a higher desired level of long-run inflation on the p art of the Com mittee
than they had p reviously believed, then they wou ld likely foresee an easier policy
stance i n the near term, but hi gher nominal interes t rates  in the longer run.   In that
case,  long-term yiel ds could increas e, and the f oreign exchange val ue of the dollar
would likely f all.  Alternativel y, market part icipants  might see the change i n policy as
reflecting a deterioration in the outlook that they h ad not yet observed .  If so, l onger-
term  yields w ould presumably decline, as w ould stock prices and the dollar. 
Mon etary and Credit Agg regates
(21) M2 is proje cted t o accel erate gradual ly in coming months under  the
assum ptions o f the G reenb ook fo recast.  Th e effects of the su bstantial d rop-o ff in
mortgage r efinancin g activity o n liquid  depo sits, which  have trim med M2 cons iderab ly
of late, are ex pecte d to dimini sh gradua lly.  Nonethe less, with the  boost t o M2 from
past monet ary pol icy easing s tailing of f, and lower s tock pr ice v olatility per haps
15
encourag ing some hous eholds  to shi ft funds fr om M 2 ass ets ba ck int o equit ies, the
expansi on of M2 is ex pecte d to remai n modest.   M2 is proje cted t o be about f lat from
September t hrough December,  bringi ng its  incre ase f or 2003 a s a whole  to around 
5-3/4 pe rcent .  With a s mall f urther  drag f rom the sl owing of mort gage re financing
flows a nd no change i n opportuni ty cos ts, M2 growth in 2004  is forecas t at 5 -1/2
percent, a bit below the pace o f expansion in no minal incom e.  The resulting increase
in M 2 velocity w ould be the first in  seven ye ars.  M 2 is proje cted to slo w sligh tly
further in 2 005, reflecting small er gai ns in nomina l income and the ef fects on
opportun ity costs of the tightening of policy in the second ha lf of the year.
(22) The g rowth rate o f dom estic non financial sec tor deb t is expected  to
decli ne over t he Greenbook pe riod.   Household se ctor de bt is projec ted to  slow
noticeably  in the current  quarter, a nd then to decelera te a bit f urther in 2004 and 2005,
though it c ontinues to  expand at a slightly faster rate than disposable personal income. 
A reduction in the pace of mor tgage refinancing, and a consequent fall in the volume
of cas h rais ed from suc h trans actions, is as sociated wi th a sl owing in mortg age debt
that is only partly offset by an acceleration in consum er credit.  In the corporate 
sector, the pick up in inv estment  spendi ng in coming months  is ne arly matched by
rising profits, li miting bu siness borrowing .  Howev er, the rise in investment outlays
subseque ntly outst rips profi ts, and busine ss debt  growth pic ks up.   Federal  borrowing
remains con siderable through 2 004, but it is projected to slow in 2005 as the b udget
deficit narr ows.  A ll told, deb t of the d omestic non financial sec tors is pro jected to
expan d 8-1/ 4 percen t in 2003  and th en to slo w to 7  percen t and 6 -1/4 p ercent in
2004 and 200 5, respectively.

Appendix:  The Sept ember FOMC  Announcement
Paragraph Text
1. Pol icy de cision The Fed eral Open  Mark et Com mittee decided tod ay to keep
its ta rget for the federal fun ds rate a t 1 p ercent. 
2. Ratio nale The Com mittee continues  to believe  that an accommodative
stanc e of moneta ry poli cy, coupled wi th robus t underl ying
growth in pr oducti vity, is provi ding import ant ongoi ng
support to econ omic activity. The evidence accum ulated over
the intermeet ing per iod conf irms tha t spendi ng is f irming,
although the labo r market has been  weakening. Bu siness
pricing  pow er and  increases in  core co nsum er prices re main
muted. 
3. Ass essment  of
risksThe Com mittee percei ves that t he upside and downside risks
to the attainment of sustainab le growth for the n ext few
quarte rs are roughl y equal . In c ontras t, the proba bility, though
minor, of an u nwelcom e fall in inflati on exceeds that of a rise
in inflation from its already low level. The C omm ittee judges
that, on b alance, the r isk of inflation  becom ing un desirab ly
low re main s the pre dom inant co ncern  for the fo reseeable
future.  In these ci rcumstances,  the Comm ittee believes  that
policy ac commodation  can be  main tained fo r a con siderab le
period.
