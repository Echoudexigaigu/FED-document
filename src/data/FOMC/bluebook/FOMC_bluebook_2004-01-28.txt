Expectations for Monetary Policy
The inclusion of the “considerable period” language in the last four FOMC
statements has helped to  anchor near-term  policy expectations.  Indeed, near-term
futures ra tes have h eld close to  1 percen t, and im plied vo latility over a fo ur-m onth

to a 1- 3/4 perc ent ra te th is year and t o head hig her in t he abse nce of a ny adjus tment
in the nom inal federal funds rate.  To counter these pressu res given an assum ed
inflat ion goal of 1 perce nt, the Tayl or rule call s for polic y tighteni ng to begin this y ear
so as t o keep t he real  funds r ate from fall ing (t he dashe d line s).  Although inf lation
neverth eless picks u p a little ove r the nex t two y ears, unem ploym ent is held  abov e its
natura l rate for lon g eno ugh to  bring th e inflation  rate back  towa rd the b aseline resu lt
of 1 percent toward the latter part of the  decade. 
(12) With regard to the imm ediate choice of policy, if the Com mittee shares
and fi nds acc eptabl e the s taff outl ook of a c losing output ga p and a st able 1  perce nt
core PCE infl ation rate  over t he next  two year s, it might c hoose an unchang ed
target for t he federal funds rate at thi s meeti ng.  The Committe e might i nterpr et th e
recent st rength in privat e spending, and part icularl y the rebound in manufacturing,  as
signs that a  more ro bust expa nsion is  under  way an d tha t the thr eat of a pern icious
decline in inflation has receded further.  Altho ugh the C omm ittee may continue to see
sizable odds on inf lation edging l ower, it may ass ign only modest cost to s uch an
outco me if asso ciated w ith faster-than -expected  prod uctivity gr owth  rather th an w ith
unan ticipated a nd p otentially se lf-feeding w eakness in  aggreg ate dem and.  W ith
economic gr owth reboundi ng and subs tantial moneta ry stimulus s till in pl ace, the
Com mittee may even view disi nflati on risks as  about offset  by the probabili ty that
inflation pressures will be stronger than in the G reenbook.  Bu t even if the Com mittee
believes  that the next  policy move will l ikely be a t ightening,  it might als o judge that
the pro cess need  not b egin at th is meetin g becau se of the cu rrent low  inflation r ate
and persist ent resource s lack.  In particul ar, it may still  see the cos ts of an
accomm odative policy stance as low in the cu rrent environm ent when w eighed against
the bene fits of pos sibly counte ring an  unexpect ed weakeni ng in the  expansi on of
private spending. 
10
(13) By contr ast, if the Committee i s conce rned,  in light of r ecent
unex pected ly soft inflation  readin gs and  weak ness in th e labor m arket, that eco nom ic
growth may not r emain rapi d enough to r emove res ource s lack before  inflation
declines sig nificantly fu rther, then  it migh t choo se to  cut t he tar get f edera l funds
rate 25  basi s poin ts at thi s meeti ng.  Though i ncoming data  have poi nted t o a
strength ening  in priva te spend ing, the eco nom ic expan sion m ay fail to gain  traction if
business confidence is set back or con sumer d emand  is eroded by con tinued sluggish
employment gr owth.  The l ackluster  demand for f unds by busi nesse s, continui ng
contraction of M 2 and ban k credit, and higher energy p rices may add to su ch
concer ns.  Eve n if t he economy ex pands as  rapidl y as pr edict ed in t he Greenbook,  the
slowdow n in actual produ ctivity growth projected by th e staff may fail to materialize,
implyi ng furt her dis inflation that,  while not  of the  pernic ious va riety, may be
unwelcome.   Indeed,  members may rega rd the pr evailing r ate of  inflation as nea r the
botto m of a range  that they  view a s desirab le over th e long er run  and m ay wish  to
implement a  polic y setting t hat re duces downsi de ris ks to gr owth while  incre asing  the
scope for inflation to mo ve up som ewhat over tim e, such as depicted in the longer-
run sce nario o f Cha rt 5 in w hich th e inflation  goal is assu med to be 1-1 /2 pe rcent.
(14)  Abstract ing fr om the curre nt stance of  its communicati ons with t he
public, the Com mittee migh t wish to consider a p ossible tightening of policy  that
would begin to  rem ove some of the prevailing substantial d egree of monetary ease. 
The economy now  seems to be growing robustly,  and over the last  two years the re al
funds rate has been ab out zero, rough ly around the low er edge of a range of estim ated
equil ibrium values of  this rate (Chart 8 ).  Moreover,  the Committee  may put a hi gh
probability on the em ergence of stronger inflation pressures, similar to that envisioned

Committee’s stated com mitm ent to ke ep po licy accom modative fo r a con siderab le
period, a t ightening at t his meeting may not be in the car ds.  However, concerns t hat
inflation press ures c ould ari se more qui ckly than gene rally expec ted might  induce t he
Com mittee to adjust its comm unications to better reflect its weighing of such
expectations for policy.
Policy Announc ement , Dir ective, and Ass essment o f Risks.
(15) If the Committee believe s that event s are unfoldi ng about as it had
expected in D ecember, then it m ay want to ado pt language in the ratio nale
paragrap h of it s announce ment gener ally similar t o that i n the st atement  following
the last meet ing (gi ven in a ppendix A),  with appr opriat e revi sions  to ref lect rece nt
economic da ta.  The rati onale pa ragra ph could aga in begi n by noti ng that  the
accommodativ e stance of p olicy and vi gorous gr owth in produc tivity are provi ding
ongoing s upport t o economic a ctivity.  In v iew of t he data  rece ived ove r the
interm eeting p eriod, the  Committee mig ht wish  to repea t the com ment that “o utpu t is
expandi ng bris kly.”  However, g iven t he dive rgence s among the hous ehold and
payro ll surveys an d oth er labor  mar ket indic ators, the C ommittee m ay now  wan t to
charac terize the l abor market  as “sho wing mixed s ignal s” rat her tha n as “i mproving
modestly .”  The s tatement could a gain not e that  price  incre ases remain muted a nd
that inflation is expected to remain low .  By contrast, if the Comm ittee elects t o ease
polic y at t his meet ing, the ra tiona le par agraph would pr esumably  need to be
augm ented to  note th e Co mmittee’s desire to h elp m aintain th e vigor o f the econ omic
expan sion an d to gu ard ag ainst a sign ificant furth er declin e in inflation , or, perhap s, to
indic ate its des ire for a rev ersal of s ome portion of  the re cent di sinflation.  If  the
Committee elects to tigh ten po licy, the ration ale parag raph c ould be m odified to  note
the cur rent low  real fund s rate relative to  mea sures of its eq uilibrium  level.
12
(16) The range o f choices regarding the balanc e-of-risks par agraph  will
depend import antly on whether  the Committee  decide s to al ter its communica tion
strategy fo llowin g the d iscussion  of that to pic on  the first day  of the m eeting.  Th is
Bluebook as sumes tha t the  Comm ittee deci des to r etain, at least for this meeting,  the
framewo rk employed  in the Decem ber annou ncemen t.  If so,  and if the Com mittee
sees relatively li ttle change in its assessment of the outlook, it may w ish to issue a
statement  simil ar to that of the last meet ing, with the  risks to the  prosp ects for eco nom ic
grow th in ba lance, the p robab ility of an u nwelcom e fall in inflation  almo st equa l to
that of a rise in inflation, and no men tion of an overall assessment of risks.  Because
the latest inflation data ha ve been r ather  soft, the Committee might  prefe r to omit  the
reference  to dimin ished disinflation r isks, and mere ly prov ide re lative odds of  the
chang e in inflation  as in: “Th e prob ability of a fall in  inflation a ppear s only sligh tly
above t hat of  a ris e in i nflation. ” 
(17) Alternatively, the Com mittee may w ish to consider chang ing its assessment
of risks to  sustai nable econom ic growth .  The Committe e may have s een ri sks to the out look
for economic growth in December as balanced on the view that , although output was
likely to expand abov e trend for a t ime, i t was l ikely to sl ow to a sus tainable pa ce by
the time the level of outpu t reached that of its potential.  If,  instead, Com mittee
members int erpre t the  term “sus tainable e conomic growt h” as si mply denoti ng
potential output gro wth and  see the growth o f spending as likely to exceed that of its 
potential f or the next fe w quarters, t hey may prefer to announce at t his meeting an
assessment of  net upsi de ris ks to s ustai nable gr owth.
(18) The C ommittee m ay also w ish to alter its c haracter ization  of the degree  of
balance regar ding the infl ation outlook  at thi s meeti ng.  The s trengt h of inc oming data on
spend ing m ight be ta ken as im plying th at the pr obab ility of an u nwelcom e fall in
inflation has dropped even further.  Whi le the Co mmi ttee still may see some
13
possibility that inflation ticks l ower, it may also judg e that outcom e as much  more 
likely to oc cur in th e conte xt of a rap idly exp andin g econ omy with r obust prod uctivity
grow th rathe r than slo wing  dem and.  T hus, the C ommittee m ight pre fer a rou ghly
balanced assessment of th e probabilities of a  rise or u nwelcome fall in inflation. 
Alternatively, the surprisingly low recent inflation readings and  the chance of a higher
productivity  scenario with l arge persi sting output gaps and dis inflat ion pressures  may
lead t he Committee t o reta in at least the  modest as ymmetry about  the i nflation
outlook adopted at th e last meeting. 
(19)  Another is sue re lated to the  polic y announce ment is whe ther t o reta in,
mod ify, or delete the sentence “However, with inflati on quite low and resource use sl ack, the
Committee belie ves that pol icy acc ommodation can be maintained for a conside rable peri od.”  The
Committee’s treatm ent of th is statem ent m ay dep end o n its view s regard ing the lik ely
timing an d steepn ess of a tightening phas e for pol icy, as reflected in the  prev ious
discussion of al terna tive long-r un infl ation goals .  If the Committee  took it s goal  of
price stability to be consistent with a longer-run inflation rate abov e 1 percent, then
presumabl y it would put low odds  on fir ming polic y anyt ime soon and woul d be
relatively more c omfort able with  retaining the  “cons iderable per iod” sent ence  with out
modific ation.  However,  if members  see a n incre ased c hance t hat, with cont inuing
subst antial financi al accommodation,  a combinat ion of r obust ec onomic growth a nd
higher  inflation expect ations will  boost i nflation a bove an ac cepta ble ra nge over  the
next year or t wo, it might want to delet e this s entence to provide t he flexi bility for a 
near-term tightening o f policy should that prov e necessary.  The backup  in interest
rates, drop in the  stock  market,  and ris e in t he doll ar tha t would li kely resul t from
delet ing thi s sent ence might  be see n by the Committe e as a c heck on t he ext ent of
financial  stimulus in t he economy.   Even if  the Committee  put low odds on t ighte ning
polic y someti me soon, i t may vie w the cos t of e ither dela ying ne eded ti ghteni ng or
14
reneging on its c omm itment, s hould inflati on pressures pic k up unexpectedly,  as
sufficiently damaging t o its credi bility to  warrant  removing t he “consi derabl e peri od”
preem ptively.  H owever, the C ommittee c ould move grad ually tow ard eve ntually
deleting the sen tence by declaring, for example, “With inflation quite low an d resource use
slack, the Com mittee believes that it  can be patient in adjust ing the very ac commodative stance of
monetary policy. ”  Market par ticipant s would li kely read s uch a chang e as pr epari ng the
way for a n event ual re moval of t he curr ent hi ghly ac commodative pol icy stance , and
interest rates would likely back up as investors bro ught forward  the anticipated onset
of tightening. 
(20) If the Co mmi ttee decides to retain a sentence, possibly in mo dified form,
regarding the period  for which po licy accomm odation can b e maintained, it may feel
that s uch a st atement  provide s a suf ficient summary ass essment  of the  polic y outl ook
and thus de cide,  as in Dec ember, t hat a s eparat e sent ence on t he overall balance of risks
is not ne eded.   E ven if the C ommittee d rops th e consid erable-p eriod sen tence, if it
views the ri sks to achi eving sustai nable growth as balanced and the probabi lities of an
increase  or an unwelcome fall in inf lation as  close to bal anced, then i t may think an
expli cit statement of t he overa ll risk assessment is  redundant .  However,  if the
Comm ittee now beli eves t hat the re are  upside  risks to s ustai nable gr owth or tha t the
risk of disin flation rem ains clearly la rger tha n the p robab ility of an inc rease in
inflation, it might want to consider resu ming an  announ cement of the o verall risk
assessment. 
(21)  Shou ld the Com mittee wish to follow  the same pro cedure as at the last
meeting,  it could vote  on the di rective a nd on languag e ass ociat ed with t he

Market Reaction
(22) Market par ticipant s unive rsally ex pect no c hange in  the st ance of
mon etary policy at this meeting and g enerally view a change in th e FO MC’s risk
assessment as unlikely.  Thus, mark et prices would p resumab ly be little aff ected by a
statement enco mpassing  no change i n polic y, no c hange in  the ri sk as sessments,  and
no chang e in the considerable-period senten ce.  By contrast, interest rates could rise
subst antially in re sponse t o a sta tement t hat el iminat ed the c onside rable -peri od
sentence, particularly if accompanied by a risk assessmen t suggesting increased
concer ns about e xcess ively rapi d economic gr owth.  The mark et reaction would be
more subdued with a mo dified consi derable-per iod sentence t hat continued to le ave
the impressi on that a  tight ening of  polic y was not i mminent and would l ikely be
gradual  once begun.
(23) Investo rs wo uld b e caug ht un awar es by a d ecision to  ease po licy at this
meeting, and  other sh ort-term interest rates would decline w ith the federal funds rate. 
The conse quences  for l onger- maturit y yields would de pend on the wor ding of t he
announ cement and  the market’s reading of the im plications of the decision for longer-
term inf lation rate s.  Intermedi ate- and longe r-term yie lds would l ikely fall, and
especially sh arply if the a nnouncem ent con veyed a  sense tha t the FO MC inte nded  to
keep p olicy m ore acco mmodative  for som e time in  order  to cou nter the r isks of a
shortfall in aggregate deman d or of disinflation pressures stemm ing from u pward
shifts in produc tivity.  Given  this downwar d rev ision to i nves tors’ expe ctations a bout
the pat h of poli cy, stock  price s would li kely rise, and the dol lar woul d fall.  A decisi on
to tighten policy at this meeting w ould similarily com e as a shock to m arket
participants, as i t would seem at variance with their interpretation of th e FO MC’s
recent communicat ion ef forts.  Intere st rates woul d like ly rise sha rply, though the
extent of the increase in longer-term rates cou ld be dam pened som ewhat by a
17
reduc tion in e xpectatio ns for th e long -run ra te of inflation .  The sto ck m arket w ould
likely sell off  substantially, and the dollar wou ld rise.
Mon etary and Credit Agg regates
(24) The staff an ticipates that M2 will resume growing this quarter. 
Refinancing eff ects should exe rt considera bly less  drag, and rapid growth of nominal
incom e shou ld pro vide a lift to m oney g rowth.  Still, the velo city of M 2 is expec ted to
conti nue ris ing, as inv estor s conti nue to f avor ca pital market  instruments a t the
expense of M 2 assets.  Over the period from  Decem ber through  June, M2  is projected
to expand at a 3-1/ 2 percent annu al rate.
(25) Growth o f total do mestic n onfina ncial secto r debt is ex pected  to
moderate t his y ear but  to a pac e that  still exceeds  that of  nominal i ncome.  Much of
the dec eleration refl ects a slowi ng in the  expansi on of mortga ge cre dit, as mortga ge

Paragraph Text
1. Pol icy de cisionThe Fed eral Open  Mark et Com mittee decided tod ay to keep
its target for th e federal fu nds rate  at 1 perc ent.
2. Ratio naleThe Com mittee continues  to believe  that an accommodative
stanc e of moneta ry poli cy, coupled wi th robus t underl ying
growth in pr oducti vity, is provi ding import ant ongoi ng
support to econ omic activity. The evidence accum ulated over
the intermeet ing per iod conf irms tha t output  is expanding
briskly, and the l abor market  appears  to be i mproving
modestly .  Inc reases in core c onsumer pri ces a re muted and
expected to remain  low.
3. Ass essment  of
risksThe Com mittee percei ves that t he upside and downside risks
to the attainment of sustainab le growth for the n ext few
quarters are roughly equal.  The  probability of an unw elcome
fall in inflation ha s dimini shed i n rece nt months and no w
appears almo st equal to that of a rise in inflation. However,
with inflation quite low an d resource use slack, the Co mmittee
believes that policy accomm odation can b e maintained for a
consi derabl e peri od.

       Note: Rule prescriptions for 2004Q1 through 2004Q4 are calculated using Greenbook projections for inflation and the outp ut gap (or
       unemployment gap). It is assumed that there is no feedback from the rule prescriptions to the Greenbook projections over  the indicated
       horizon.
Rules Chart: Explanatory Notes
In all of the rules below, it denotes the federal funds rate, Bt the staff estimate at date t of trailing four-
quarter core PCE inflation , (yt-yt*) the staff estimate (at date t) of the output gap, it-1 the lagged federal
funds rate, gt-1 the residual from the rule’s prescription the previous quarter, (yt+3|t-yt+3|t*) the staff’s
three-quarter-ahead forecast of the output gap, () yt+3|t-) yt+3|t*) the staff’s forecast of output growth less
potential output growth three quarters ahead, Bt+3|t a three-quarter-ahead forecast of inflation, and (ut+3|t-
ut+3|t*) a three-quarter-ahead forecast of the unemployment gap.  Data are quarterly averages taken from
the Greenbook and staff memoranda closest to the middle of each quarter, unless otherwise noted.
