MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIV ES
Recent D evelo pments
(1) Although the  Comm ittee’s deci sion at  its January  meeting t o leav e the
target federal funds rate at 1 percent had b een widely anticipated by financial m arket
participa nts, the sub stitution o f the “can  be patien t” clause fo r the “co nsidera ble
period” phrase in  the announcement elicited an a ppreciable market reaction. 
Inves tors a pparent ly per ceived the wordi ng change a s a pre cursor  of poli cy tighteni ng
and brou ght forward th e expected onset of firming  from the fall to the sum mer
(Chart 1 ).  That se ntiment  did not pe rsist:  The Chairman’ s monetar y poli cy te stimony
and weaker -than-expe cted da ta on nonf arm payrol l employment  for Ja nuary and,
especial ly, Februar y seemed to reass ure investors  that policy  tightening was s ome way
off.  Implied f ederal  funds r ates fell as much as  55 basi s point s, on  net, over t he
intermeeti ng peri od and now indic ate that a f ull 25  basis  points  of ti ghteni ng is not
expected until  around year-end.  According to a r ecent survey  by the Trading Desk,
none of the twenty-t hree primary dealer s expect a change i n the funds rate t arget at
this meeting, and abo ut two-fifths anticipate firming to be deferred un til next year.1

Foreign Official Holdings of U.S. Treasury Securities
Foreign official holdings of U.S. Treasury securities have increased
rapidly in recent years,           
             
  .   Treasury securities held in custody for foreign official
institutions at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York have expanded more
than $275 billion since mid-2002, to about $900 billion–or about one-quarter
of all outstanding marketable Treasury securities (Chart).  Market participants
have been interpreting the elevated level of indirect bidding at auctions as
evidence of increased participation by these institutions.
Some market participants have argued that purchases by foreign official
institutions have depressed Treasury yields.  While the run-up in foreign
official holdings coincided with declines in Treasury yields, it is difficult to
quantify the effects of these purchases.  One might presume that the purchases
would have some impact because they have been quite large–amounting to
about one-third of net Treasury issuance since 2002–and have been made by
entities that generally do not substitute among alternative instruments.  That
said, the considerable size and liquidity of the Treasury market should tend to
limit any price consequences.  Moreover, some of these institutions have
concentrated their purchases in shorter-term securities, where more private
assets are available to other investors as substitutes and where prices are more
strongly anchored by monetary policy expectations.  In that regard, swap
spreads have generally narrowed, on balance, since mid-2002, in contrast to the
widening that would be expected if foreign official purchases were shifting the
overall balance of demand toward Treasury securities.

abou t rising ho use pric es, and th e Ban k of C anad a cut its po licy rate 25 b asis poin ts in
early March  as inflation there dipped further below  its target.  Stock prices in most
foreign industrial countries rose m odestly over mu ch of the period, but erased tho se
gains today in the w ake of the act of terrorism in M adrid.  Yields on long -term
gover nment bo nds ge nerally d eclined– albeit sligh tly less than th ose on  com parab le
U.S. Tre asury  secur ities.  Amid further  signs  of gat hering  economic s trengt h in Japa n,
share  price s rose , and l ong-te rm yiel ds were a bout unchange d.
(4) The do llar rose slightly against an index of currencies of our other
importan t trading partners.  The Ba nk of M exico tightened policy in Feb ruary, its firs t
firming in nearly a year.  The M exican peso traded in a n arrow rang e and declined
about 1 percent on net vis-a-vis the dollar over th e interm eeting period.  Brazil’s
EMB I+ sprea d widened 13 0 basi s point s, to about 5½ perc entage  points , and
Brazilian share prices drop ped sharply, as prospects for the govern ment’s reform
program  worsened  in the face of a corruption scand al.  Asian stock markets record ed

busin esses rem ain flush  with fu nds in  the agg regate, they  have step ped u p their
borrowing both in financial  markets and from banks (Chart 4).   For the nonfinancial
busin ess sector as  a wh ole, debt is es timated  to be ex pand ing at a 5  percen t rate this
quarte r, a bit f aster than i n the f ourth quar ter.  In the hous ehold s ector , debt  is on
track to g row at a 9 per cent rate in  the first qu arter.  Co nsum er credit g rowth
registered a substantial pickup in Janu ary from the slow  pace at the end of last year,
and low interest rates and higher house prices have supported mortgage debt growth. 
Federal debt is projected to exp and at a nearly 13 percen t rate this quarter.

Policy Al ternati ves
(7)  Economic data  released ove r the i ntermeet ing per iod, espec ially readings
on th e labor m arket, fell short o f staff expectatio ns, and th e projec tion of G DP grow th
over the fi rst half  of this y ear has been marked down about ½ p ercentage point  relati ve
to that in the January G reenbook.  Still, accomm odative mo netary policy and rob ust
prod uctivity ga ins are ex pected  to sup port o utpu t grow th later this y ear and  next,
leaving the  projec tion l ittle cha nged over  that pe riod.   In thi s Greenbook a s in t he
previous one, t he staff  assumes that the Committee will begi n to tighten poli cy in 2005,
raising the target federal funds rate to 2 percent by the en d of that year.  Stock prices
are anticip ated to a pprec iate from  curren t levels at a rate th at prov ides inve stors w ith
risk-adjusted returns com parable to those on  fixed-income instrum ents.  Longer-term
Treasury yields increase gradually over the forecast period , but corporate yields are
expected to hold stead y as the improvem ent in the econom ic outlook trims risk
spread s.  The d ollar is aga in assum ed to d epreciate g radua lly, albeit starting  from  its
curren t highe r level.  The downward revi sion t o economic gr owth fore casted over t he
first hal f of t his y ear implies  less headway  in reduc ing re source  slack.  Alt hough the
outp ut gap  is cut by m ore tha n half o ver the n ext two  years, it follow s a track ab out 
½ percenta ge point  deeper  than tha t in t he las t Greenbook a nd ends 200 5 at ar ound 
¾ percen t.  The output gap  puts dow nward p ressure on inflation over the forecast
horizon, offsetting upward pressures from higher oil and non-oil import prices.  On
net, core PC E inflation is projected to hold steady near 1 percent this year and next. 
As com pared with the forecasts of the B oard m embers and  Bank presiden ts prepared
for the Januar y meeti ng, the sta ff anticipates tha t real GDP will grow at  the t op end of
policym akers’ centra l tenden cy of 4½  to 5 per cent for 2 004 an d that in flation w ill

(8) At its last meeting, the Com mittee instructed the staff to include a mo re
comp lete analysis in the Bluebook of po ssible wording cho ices for the policy
announcement ( see box  entitled “Some General I ssues  Concerning St atement

policy annou ncemen t, the staff  viewed a chan ge in the federal funds rate at this

Some General  Issues Conce rning S tatement Language
As is e vident  in the  chart  below, t he words of t he FOM C’s st atement s are  importa nt:  The
overall t one and content of FOM C statements can eli cit signifi cant immediate market
react ions and s ometimes may col or the  way market par ticipant s respond to subs equent
incom ing new s and e vents.  B ut wh ile “wo rds m atter” in F OMC co mmunica tions,
stateme nt langu age sho uld no t be view ed as an  indep ende nt instrum ent of m onetary  policy. 
Presumably, the st atement influences  markets because parti cipants bel ieve that  it conveys
inform ation tha t bears dire ctly or ind irectly on p otential fu ture po licy action s.  Thu s, at least
over the lo nger run , the im portance of s tatem ent la nguage d epends on its  connection w ith
observ ed po licy action s.
The likely m arket rea ction to a n FO MC stateme nt is hard  to judge .  When th e policy  rate is
changed, on e can  fore cast th e market reac tion b y usin g sur veys and  intere st rate fu tures  to
measure ex -ante m arket ex pectation s.  W hen o nly the w ordin g of the a nnounce ment is
changed, predicti ng the market react ion is much more problematic.  There is no si mple way
to map alternati ve wording in FOM C statements int o basis-point  equivalents t o arrive at
the a nalogue of a p olicy  rate c hange.  A nd even if this w ere p ossib le, on e would still nee d to
know the lang uage t hat t he market e xpects .  These  caveat s notwi thstanding,  the di scuss ion
in this Blueb ook does  hazar d spe culations ab out l ikely marke t reactions to alternative
FOMC stateme nts; these rep resent the sta ff’s best gue sses of the lik ely m arket rea ctions,
but the confidence i ntervals  are quite wide.

3 As ec onomic circ umstances ch ange o ver tim e, the alterna tives presen ted in
futur e Bluebooks  will genera lly include anal yses of pote ntial change s in t he sta nce of
policy as w ell as in the proposed wording of th e associated statem ents.  meeting as sufficiently unlikely that this Bluebook presents three draft FOMC

(9) Although econo mic data  over t he int ermeeti ng peri od have gen erally run 
on the soft si de of expectat ions, t he Com mittee might sti ll beli eve that,  with financi al
cond itions reg istering o nly a sm all net cha nge, the ec onomy is p ositione d to attain
sustaina ble econ omic grow th with  mea sures of co re inflation  rema ining clo se to levels
that many  members have c haract erize d as ef fective pr ice stability.  While  the
Committee ma y be disa ppointed th at econ omic slack no w seem s likely to pe rsist at a
higher level than anticipated in Janu ary, it might also judge that additional p olicy ease
would likely ha ve its m ost stim ulative effects w hen th e econ omy was a lready clo se to
its potential.  The  case for inaction ma y be comp elling even if memb ers harbor some
doubts abo ut the outlook.  O n the one han d, were capital spending to ex pand m ore
slowly  than i n the st aff forec ast, the al terna tive simulat ion in t he Greenbook t racing
out the effects of lingering caution on the p art of business executives wou ld suggest
that ov erall GDP growth would not be mat erially impaire d.  On the ot her hand,  if the
Comm ittee bel ieved that pr essur es on re source s might bui ld rel atively qui ckly, the
poten tial costs of a p olicy erro r associated  with a n un chang ed po licy stance m ight still
be judge d to be l ess worr isome tha n the cos ts that coul d be ass ociat ed with t ighte ning
polic y at t his time.  While  the cur rent de gree of  polic y accommodati on cannot be
sustained i n the l ong run,  market pa rticipant s are  not li kely to vie w retent ion of t he
curren t stance of  polic y as a r eason t o mark up inf lation expect ations, g iven pe rsisting
resource slack and rapid productivity growth.

shown in Alternative B .  Given  the inco ming data, the  Committee mig ht wish  to
acknowle dge that  the pac e of new hi ring ha s been “disappoin ting” but note that other
indic ators  point t o “conti nued”  improvem ent in the labor m arket.  Also, the Com mittee
migh t wan t to state tha t “evidence .  . .indic ates that output i s continuing to expand briskly. ”  If
the Com mittee’s sense of the econom ic risks has not changed greatly since the Janu ary
meeting, the wo rding of the Janu ary balance-of-risks assessment would  seem
appropriate at  this meeting.   Market participant s would likely r ead such a stat ement as
confi rming that  the Committee ’s economic and pol icy out look i s basi cally unchange d,
and a ny m arket reac tion to th e statem ent w ould prob ably be  small.
Alternative C
(11) In contr ast, the Committee  may have bec ome more confi dent,  in vi ew of
conti nued bris k spendi ng growth and ga ins in manufact uring out put, that t he
expansion has become self -sustai ning.  To be sure,  news about the labor market has
been disappointing, but this may point to continued strong gains in productivity. 
Indica tors g eneral ly suggest  that a ggregat e demand is  holding up qui te wel l.  The rece nt
strength of c apital spe nding has  been par ticularly notewort hy, pe rhaps of fering
increasin gly con crete evid ence th at the pe rvasive g loom  abou t busin ess prosp ects
evinced by corporate  executives  over much of the last t wo years is l ifting.  Against that
backdrop,  the Committee  also mig ht be more wary  about the  risk that  inflation
press ures c ould begi n to emerge  despi te th e curre nt output  gap.  I ndeed,  rising oil  and
comm odity price s might be cited as  hints of i nflati on pressures.   As in the alter native
simulat ion pres ented i n the Green book, a  signi ficant pi ckup in i nflation e xpect ations
would pu ll real interest ra tes below  their alread y-low lev els and g radua lly feed into
actual inf lation.   How ever, e ven if the Committee viewed thes e arguments as
compelling, it m ight see so me b enefit in d eferring tig htenin g to a tim e wh en m arkets
were bet ter pr epared f or such a ction.
(12) Given thi s assessment , the Committee might  wish to i ssue a  statement

inflation e xpecta tions r emain conta ined,” eliminating the forw ard-looking ph rase “and are
expect ed to re main low” tha t appea red in t he Januar y statement.   This t one could be
reinf orced by  modest re visions in t he bala nce-of -risks a ssessment.   For example , the
Committee could  indicate a  slight cha nge in  its inflation o utlook  by stating  that “the
probabilit y of a rise  in inflati on about equals that of an unwelcome decl ine in inflat ion.”  Lastly,
while the Co mmittee may not be prep ared at this meeting to d ispense with references
to “pat ience ,” it might wi sh to add a  sente nce tha t hint s that  its patience i s not
unlimit ed.  Thi s coul d be accompl ished with an i nsert ion so t hat the  revised pas sage
read, “The Com mittee recog nizes that the  stance of  monetary policy has been quite ac commodative for
some time.   Nonethele ss, with inf lation low and re source use sl ack, t he Committee bel ieves that i t can
still be pat ient in re moving  its policy accommodati on.”  M arket pa rticipants w ould be qu ick to
notic e thes e revi sions  and, i n all likelihood,  would inte rpret  the cha nges as  further st eps
aimed at  clearing t he way for  an event ual re turn of  the t arget  feder al funds rat e to a
more neutra l setting.  I ntere st rates likely would move up on tha t reading,  resul ting i n a
conco mitan t dip in sto ck prices, b ut the re tention  of som e referenc e to patien ce wo uld
likely diminish t he odds of  an outsi zed market  react ion.
Alternative A
(13) The Comm ittee might v iew the  jury a s still out as t o whether t he
expansi on has bec ome self -sustaining at  the cur rent s etting of pol icy.  Indeed,
memb ers might regard the c ontinued sluggishnes s in employment as a sign that
businesses  similarl y have yet t o reach a judgment on that score.   And w ith fi scal
impetus exp ected to  wan e, there m ay be so me co ncern  that w eak em ploym ent gro wth
could begin to weigh on consumer confidence and spending,  eventually  calli ng for an
easing of pol icy.  Such concer n might be al l the more acute  if the Committee vi ewed a
stabl e nominal f unds rat e in t he fac e of downward r evisions t o many measures  of the
equil ibrium federal  funds r ate (Chart 5)  as an e ffective tighteni ng of pol icy.  The
Comm ittee would be pa rticular ly uncomfor table with t his de velopment  if the
prevailing inflation rate were viewed to b e already on the low  side of its preferred
inflation cushi on.  While t he Committee might  see s ome benefi t to an e asier stance of
