(1)  The FO MC’s decision at its March m eeting to leave the intended level
of the  feder al funds rat e unchange d had been f ully anticipat ed in marke ts, but the
assessm ent of th e econ omy in the ac companyin g statem ent w as read a s havin g a soft
cast, and interest rates moved low er.1  In the weeks that follow ed, however, interest
rates rose sharply in response to the m uch-stronger-than-expected em ploymen t report
for March  and to other d ata releases pointing to firming ho usehold and  business
spending and risi ng prices,  as well as t o the Chairman’s stat ement in congressional
testimony that  “the t hreat  of def lation is no l onger an i ssue. ”  Futures  markets  and
dealer surveys s uggest virtually no expectation of a rate move at t he M ay m eeting. 
With regar d to the  assoc iated stat ement,  deale rs appa rentl y anti cipat e that  the
Com mittee will  modify or drop the refere nce to “patience ” and characteri ze the risk s
to the achievemen t of sustainable growth an d to price stability as balanced.  Market
participants now ap pear to believe that tightening w ill commen ce in the third quarter,
rather th an late in th e year as p reviou sly thou ght, and  will brin g the fed eral fund s rate

Inflation Expectations and CP I Futures
Inflat ion compensation, as measure d by the diff erence between yi elds on nominal
and index ed Treas ury se curit ies, edge d up over t he int ermeeti ng peri od for bot h the
next five  years and the s ubsequent five y ears.  Inflat ion compensation over the next
five year s has be en on an uptr end si nce la st summer, li kely reflecting str engthen ing
economic a ctivity, rising e nergy a nd commodity pri ces, and rece nt data  showing
higher -than-expe cted r ealized inf lation.  By c ontras t, the f orward inf lation
compensation measure has changed little, on net, ove r that period.   
For a more comple te view of inv estor s’ out look,  inflation compensat ion can be
computed for  all outst anding t en-ye ar inde xed note s, whi ch have r emaining
maturit ies spanni ng 2007 t o 2014 ( chart ).  At shorte r maturi ties, this informati on
can now  be supplem ented with reading s from C PI futures contracts.  CPI futures
were recently introduced  by the Ch icago M ercantile Exchange an d cover m aturities
short er tha n those  of Trea sury i ndexed debt .  While CPI f utures  remain i lliquid,  the
two measure s of i nflation c ompensati on match up fa irly well –alth ough not
perfectly–where they m eet near the end of 2006.  Inflation com pensation increases
appreciably over the nex t two years and m oves up m ore gradually thereafter,
reachi ng around 2½ perce nt at t he ten- year mat urity.  Alt hough some porti on of
the up ward  slope to  inflation c ompensatio n may ow e to inflatio n risk pr emiu ms, it
seem s likely that inflation is also  expected to rise over th e next few years.

docu ment, as well as the  money an d deb t projectio ns, are base d on  the data  available
and the staff forecast when the April Greenbook was published yesterday.  The B EA’s

grow th of 4.2 p ercent in  the first qu arter–a p ercentag e poin t below  the staff

inflation also r an fas ter than expec ted, reflecting in par t the  effects of high er ene rgy
and non-oi l import  price s and outs ized i ncreas es in a few vol atile components .  The
staff saw some signal in these releases and revised up  its projection of core consum er
price inflation about ¼  percentage point this year and  next.  In light of these
devel opments,  the st aff now assumes t hat the  Comm ittee wil l start tighte ning in t he
fall, a  quarter earlier than in the March Greenbook, an d firm gradually thereafter. 
Longer-term  interest rates move sideways ov er the forecast period, with the upw ard

the f orecas t peri od at 5¼ perce nt, still somewhat above t he sta ff’s estimate of  the

year and remain near that level through next year. 
(8) This Bluebook presents three alternatives for  the Committee’s
consi derat ion, summarized by t he draf t statement s in Tabl e 1.  Alterna tives A and B
assume that th e fed eral fun ds rate h olds at 1  percent but differ a s to the Committee’s
characte rization  of the stren gth of th e econ omy and its w illingness to  be patien t in
removing pol icy accommodation.   Alterna tive C contemplat es a quar ter-point f irming
and aligns the w ording of the statem ent accordingly.  Und er any of these alternatives,
several ch anges se em n ecessary to  upd ate the ch aracteriz ation o f econo mic
conditions.  In particular, with emp loyment gro wth averaging  170,000 per mo nth over
the first three  months o f the year, the r ationale p aragrap h cou ld indic ate that “ hiring
appears  to have  picked  up.”  And the unexpec tedly high i nflation f igures  could be
ackno wled ged b y stating th at “incomin g inflation data have m oved som ewhat higher. ”
Assu ming that th e Co mmittee now  sees the o dds o f a significan t further d ecline in
inflation a s rem ote, the assessm ent-of-risks p aragrap h sho uld ind icate that “ the upsi de
and downside risk s to th e goal of pri ce sta bility are s een as ro ughly equal.”
(9) In light of the data released over the interm eeting period, the Co mmittee
may feel mo re confident that vigorou s output grow th will be sustained and th at slack
in labor market s will  diminis h.  Moreover , the highe r-than-ant icipated pr ice da ta might
be take n as evi dence t hat inflation ha s bott omed.  In t hese c ircumst ances , the
Committe e might  want t o adopt  lang uage  that  would pr ovide more f lexibility about
future action so that it has scope to beg in unwin ding its current policy
accommodation i f circumstan ces s oon warrant , as in Alternative B .  Even if such
action were not v iewed as  imminent,  the Committee  might fa vor a cha nge in t he
wording  if memb ers put some w eight on the po ssibility of ti ghtening in the nex t few
months as more  infor mation bea ring on t he str ength of  the l abor market  and inf lation

However, wit h infl ation low and

believes t hat pol icy acco mmodati on can
likely  be re moved at a  measured pace.

trends  becomes av ailable.   Deferr ing poli cy firming,  at le ast for a ti me, may not be
seen a s espe cially cos tly:  Even i f somewhat  stron ger employ ment growth and a
slowing in the rat e of advance of producti vity pushed up labor cost s, competit ive
pressure may lead  firms to trim curren tly high profit margins, limiting the pass-
through o f rising costs to inflation.  And, while inflation comp ensation five to ten
years out i mplied by TIIS yields moved up some over the intermeeti ng period, it  has
chang ed little, on n et, since last fall, sugg esting th at long er-term  expecta tions rem ain
well-anchored.  
(10) The C ommittee h as mu ltiple opp ortun ities in its statem ent to in dicate
that the odds of po licy firming in the near future are high er than at the M arch
meeting, as show n in the colum n labeled A lternative B in Table 1.  At the sam e time,
it migh t also offer a r eason in  the ration ale parag raph w hy it do es not see  the nee d to
tighten im mediately by n oting th at “longer-term inflation exp ectations appear to have rem ained
well-anchored .”  W ith the risks  to the o utlook  balanc ed and  the eco nom y poten tially
picki ng up ste am as the g loom that we ighed on bus iness inve stment a nd hiri ng
dispe rses, Committee  members may fe el that it is now appropri ate to drop the
sente nce re ferring to pa tience in r emoving poli cy acc ommodation.  Suc h a change
may be seen a s particularly desirable if the Comm ittee believes that investors’
confi dence t hat intere st rates wi ll remain low has  been enc ouraging  the dev elopment
of financial market imb alances that could have ad verse macroeco nom ic effects as t hey
unwind.  However , members may be  concer ned that  eliminati ng any cha racteriza tion
of the Com mittee’s future action might lead m arket participants to build in outsized
expect ations about t he spee d with whic h polic y accommodati on will  be removed,
thereby augm enting the considerable tightening  in financial conditions of the past few
weeks.   The Comm ittee coul d convey t he sens e that  its curren t outl ook was cons istent
with a gr adual r eturn t o a neutr al pol icy stance  by provi ding as suranc e at t he end of
the asse ssment of risks paragraph that, “At this jun cture, with inflation low an d resource use
slack, the Com mittee believes that policy accomm odation can likely be rem oved at a m easured pace. ” 
Even w ith the inclusion of such a sentence, how ever, a statement along these lines
would li kely lead mark et par ticipant s to br ing a bi t closer i n time t he expec ted dat e of
9
the com menceme nt of m onetar y policy tig htenin g.  In respo nse, interest ra tes wo uld
rise, stock price s likel y would decline, a nd the foreign exchange v alue of the doll ar
would tend to appreciate.     
(11) If Committee  members were s ufficient ly conf ident  that t he expans ion
was now self-sust aining or saw the rec ent increas e in core inf lation as  signali ng an
upturn i n underly ing inf lation, t hen they  might fi nd an incr ease of ¼ percent age poin t
in the  feder al funds rat e at t his meet ing, as in Alternative C , to be appr opriat e.  The
Com mittee may view  the advances in investm ent outlays, coupled w ith the more
recent evi dence that hiri ng is picki ng up, as suggest ing that the t entative ness that had
earlier marked bu siness behavior has lifted.  Indeed, as increased hiring buoys inco mes
and consumer c onfide nce, the re sulting growt h in spe nding may suppor t faster gains
in investment spen ding and em ploymen t than expected by the staff, implying a sw ifter
erosion of res ource slack.   Mem bers may also be le ss confide nt than the st aff that
aggregate supply w ill continue to expand a t a rapid pace and th at the recent increases
in ener gy and non- oil import pric es wil l leave onl y a small  imprint  on infl ation
expectations.  If so, the Comm ittee, l ike financial market participants, may see a
significant r isk that inflatio n cou ld m ove hig her, sugg esting th at the tim e has co me to
adjust policy.  Indeed, if the Com mittee believes that expected inflation may rise, then
it might  see a n incre ase in the t arget  funds r ate a s nece ssary just  to avoi d a reduct ion
in the  real feder al funds rat e and a cons equent e asing  of poli cy re lative to meas ures of
the equi librium funds r ate (Chart 5) .  The ar gument for  tight er poli cy would be
strengthene d to the  exte nt that  the Committee  wants t o keep i nflation ne ar its rec ent
lows over the lon ger term, rather than allow ing some in crease.  While policy
tightening migh t put some strains on  financial markets for a time, Co mmittee
mem bers might n ot be convinced  that the elevated uncertainty and financial m arket
turbulence of 1994-95 is as relevant a preced ent as some o bservers assert, in part
because investors seem to  expect that significant tightening will comm ence soon (see
box on “Lessons From the 1994-95 Tightening Cycle”).

Lessons from the 1994-95 Tightening Cy cle
The current policy environment is s imilar in some respects t o that prevailing before th e
policy tightening in 19 94-95.  In bo th cases, an initially sluggish  expansion in
employment was accompanied by a real federal funds rate that fel l to near zero for a
time.  The nom inal federal fu nds rate target, sh own in the left pa nel on the next pa ge, is
currently 2 percentage points  lower than at the start of 1994, reflect ing in part the net
decline in inflation o ver the interv ening ten years.  T he policy tightening tha t began in
February 19 94 sparked a  period o f financi al market t urbulen ce that c aused se rious
difficulties for so me financial instit utions.  This adverse outcome has rais ed concerns
about whether similar volati lity could foll ow a move to tighter policy t his year.
The seemin gly out sized mar ket react ion to t he 1994-95 t ighte ning re flecte d several
factors .  Firs t, many mark et parti cipant s had not  fully e xpecte d a poli cy tig htenin g at tha t
time and so were poorly positi oned.  Second, investors consi derably underestimated the
ultimate extent of ti ghtening, though part  of that forecast error reflected th e surprising
streng th of th e economy af ter the  tight ening p rocess h ad begun.   (The sta ff was
surprised as we ll, and the Gree nbook fore cast of the une mploymen t rate in the four th
quarter of 1994 fell about ¾ percentage point over the course of that  year.)  Third,
uncertainty a bout the timing an d magnitude  of future po licy actions was high, p articularly
early in the tight ening cycle.  Investors  reacted to the changed economic and poli cy
outlook by selling  long-term securiti es to limit capit al losses and hedge the l engthening
durations of m ortgage portfo lios that resulted fr om higher inter est rates.  These  portfolio
adjustments a t times took plac e over short p eriods of time, le ading to volatile m oves in
long-term rates.  As s hown in the right panel , long-term yiel ds increased almost as much
as short-term r ates early in the tigh tening cycle. 
To be sure, the historical  record does suggest that chang es in the direction  of the policy
rate tend to elicit a s tronger mar ket response th an actions extend ing the existing trend in
the policy rate.  And t he turbulence in financial  markets last summer and fall may suggest
that hedging flows w ill magnify the am plitude of any sw ings in longer-term inte rest rates. 
As a result, some firms wit h large interest rate ex posures could face substanti al losses
when interest ra tes rise.  That said , there are som e signs that financ ial firms and m arkets
may be able to handle policy ti ghtening better th an they did in 1994.  Although the
expected policy path i s not as steep now as the actual  tightening th at took place ten years
ago, it is nonet heless considerably s teeper than that foreseen immediatel y before the first
tightening i n 1994.  Even if interest rates do respond s trongly to a move toward tight er
policy, financial institu tions appear be tter positioned to withsta nd the impac t owing to
improved r isk-managem ent practices.  An d, although the size  of the mortga ge marke t is
now much larger, the recent run-up i n interest rates has reduced prepayment rat es
enough to moderate the extent to w hich any further increase in rates  will induce hedgi ng
flows. 
11
Lesson s from the 19 94-95 Tight ening Cyc le (Continue d)
(12) If the Committee c hooses t o tight en poli cy at  this meeting,  then i t might
well be inclined to issue a statement like that shown in the last column of Table 1. 
This sta tement starts by noting the change in policy: “The F ederal Open  Market
Committee decide d toda y to raise  its target for th e federal fun ds rate to  1¼ percent. ”  To  avoid
repetition  later, the first sente nce of th e rationa le parag raph m ight refer o nly to
producti vity growth–“ Robust  under lying growth i n prod uctivity is providing impo rtant ong oing
support to ec onomic activity. ”  The expl anati on for t he poli cy move coul d foll ow at the e nd
of th e paragraph: “Against this backdrop, t he Com mittee fel t that some reducti on in the degree of
monetary accomm odation w as desirable to prom ote price stability and thus help sustain  the economic
expans ion.”  So long  as the Com mittee believed that the policy m ove, and the expected
react ion to t hat move i n fina ncial  markets , was l ikely to be s ufficient  to cont ain upsi de
risks for  the time being, then it m ight want to in dicate that, “With this pol icy act ion, the
Committee percei ves that the  upside and downside risks to the att ainment of sustainable gro wth for
the nex t few q uarter s are rou ghly equ al.  Sim ilarly, the up side an d dow nside risks to th e goal of price
stability a re seen as roughly e qual.”  In order to leave a sense that ad ditional policy
tightenin g wa s likely at som e poin t but th at the C ommittee d id not fo resee a rap id
retur n to a neut ral stance , the sta tement c ould end wit h “Even following today’ s action,  the
12
Committee  judges that the stance of policy is quit e accommodat ive.  Howev er, with i nflation low and
resour ce use slack , the C ommittee believes th at policy a ccomm odation  can like ly be rem oved a t a
measu red pace. ”  While market  parti cipant s expec t poli cy to t ighte n in the  not-t oo-
distant fu ture, action  at this m eeting w ould com e as a con siderab le surpr ise, especially
given the reference to patience included  in the M arch statement.  M arket interest rates
would likely m ove sign ificantly hig her, stock p rices wo uld fall, and  the do llar wo uld
rally.  If  investors took the final sentence of the statement to h eart, then these
reactions m ight be som ewhat dam ped.    
(13) While the Com mittee migh t find some enco uragem ent in the stronger
tone of recent  economic data, it  may not yet be convinced that  the expansion has
become sel f-sustai ning and may s till expe ct inflation t o remain l ow.  In ea rly 2002, for
instance, the expansion appeared  to be gaining traction for a tim e and m arket
expect ations about t he onset  of ti ghteni ng were bui lding,  but the  expansi on
subsequen tly faltered.  I f the Com mittee believed that the case for tighter policy
would  likely require at least several more mon ths of evidence, it might choo se a
statem ent fairly clo se to the o ne release d follow ing the M arch m eeting, as in
Alternative A .  With i nvest ment spendi ng sti ll reporte d to be pri marily  for
repla cement ra ther t han for e xpansi on and with onl y one month of  reas onably s trong
employm ent data in hand , the Com mittee may n ot yet be confident that bu siness
gloom has re ally lifted all that much.   Indeed,  with the  impetus t o both house hold and
busine ss spending f rom expansi onary f iscal pol icy expect ed to wane ov er coming
quarters and financial cond itions having tightened con siderably of late, some mem bers
may be conce rned tha t growth c ould fa ll back more tha n in the  staff proj ection.  The
recent uptick in inflation migh t be seen as primarily the result of temp orary factors
and, the refore, leavin g ope n the p ossibility tha t the un derlying  trend in  inflation c ould
edge l ower (much as  is di scuss ed in t he “Inf lation Reversa l” simulation  in the
Greenbook).   Moreover,  some Committee members mig ht see  the l evel of inf lation
over the past year as at the low en d of its desirable range over the long er term and so
may not be averse to a modest st ep-up.  Against t his backdrop, t he Com mittee may
continue to view  down side surprises to inflation as more costly than u pside surprises,
13
implying that a ca utious approach to m onetary policy tightening rem ains appropriate.  
(14) If the Co mmi ttee finds sufficient mer it in the selection o f Alternative A,
it could issue a statement like that shown in the corresponding column of Table 1. 
While the rec ent incre ase in inflatio n sho uld b e noted , the statem ent cou ld indic ate
that the rise is li kely to b e transitory: “Although i ncoming inf lation data hav e moved somewhat
higher, core inflation is expected to remain low.”  Even in t his vi ew, t he ris ks to t he
attainm ent of p rice stability rela ted in th e assessm ent of risks p aragrap h wo uld
presum ably be balanced.  H owever, with the vigo r of the expansion seen as less
certain an d the u pside risk s to inflation  less pressing , the Co mmittee mig ht cho ose to
retain with  only minor a djust ment the s entenc e indi cating its  belief that it can be
“patient in removi ng its policy accommodati on.”  Market par ticipant s think that  the
Com mittee is  likel y to modify or drop the ref erence to pati ence in the st atement at
this meeting,  and it s retention would probabl y lead them to push ba ck somewhat t he
expected timing o f policy tightening.  The resulting decline in m arket interest rates
would li kely spark a  modest ra lly in st ock market s but wei gh on the f oreig n exchange
value of the  dollar. 
Money  and  Debt Fo recas ts
(15) M2 growth is pr oject ed to sl ow from its  rece nt rapi d pace,  as the
temporary boost from last quarter’s high leve l of m ortgage refinancing ebbs. 
Nonethele ss, this aggrega te is expec ted to  grow about 5½ perc ent t his y ear, about the
same as last year and ½  percentage point faster than pro jected at the time of the last
Blueboo k.  The higher pro jected growth reflects in part the stronger-than-expected
underlying m oney grow th thus far this year.  Foreign dem and for U .S. currency is also
anticipated to rebound from the low growth rate posted in the first quarter. 
Nonetheless, as th e econ omic expan sion co ntinue s, househ olds are  expecte d to sh ift
the composi tion of  their portf olios  further towar d capit al marke t instruments  at the
expense of monetary assets, implying a modest rise in  M2 velocity th is year.  
(16) Growth o f total do mestic n onfina ncial deb t this year is p rojected  to
remain nea r the 8  perce nt pace  posted i n 2003.   Household debt  growth shoul d slow
as higher mo rtgage rates damp  residential investment and refinancing  activity, and so
14
trim mortgage debt  growth.   However, wi th inc reases in inves tment outl ays out pacing
gains  in prof its, busi ness bor rowing shoul d gradual ly pick up,  though fr om a very l ow
level.  Federal  debt gro wth is a lso e xpect ed to be a  little higher  this year,  reflecting the
wider deficit, b efore falling back next yea r as f iscal policy moves to ward restraint.  
Direct ive a nd Balance -of-Risks  Language
(17) Shou ld the Com mittee wish to follow  the same pro cedure as at the last
two meeti ngs, it could vote  on the di rective a nd on the l anguage of  the as sessment of
risks.  Dra ft langua ge with  a rang e of op tions for th e assessm ent of risks id entical to
those presented in Tabl e 1 is provided b elow.

(2) Risk  Assess ments
(A)  The Comm ittee per ceives tha t the  upside  and downside  risks to t he
