MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIV ES
Recent D evelo pments
(1) The decision at t he June 30 FOM C meeting to increase t he target f ederal
funds rate b y 25 basis points to 1¼ percent was anticipated in fi nancial markets. 
Nonethele ss, inves tors r evised down thei r expec tations for  the pat h of poli cy upon
the re lease of t he accompany ing st atement .  In pa rticular , invest ors not ed that  the
Com mittee attributed som e of the recent increase in inflation to transitory factors,
again c haract erize d the ri sks to sust ainabl e growth and p rice stabi lity as ba lance d, and
reiterated its b elief that po licy accom modation  could  be rem oved  at a pace  that is
likely to be measure d.1  Subsequ ently, the Chairman ’s monetary policy testimon y,
which ind icated that recent softness in consum er spending sho uld prove sho rt-lived
and em phasiz ed the F OMC’s com mitm ent to p rice stability, spu rred a rise  in
expect ations for  the pat h of poli cy.  Over the i ntermeet ing per iod to da te, though,
policy ex pectation s have b een revise d do wn o n net, as inc oming da ta have p ointed  to
weaker-than-anticipated spend ing and m ore subdu ed core inflation (Chart 1).  M oney
market fu tures and options prices, as w ell as the Desk’s survey of primary dealers, 
sugges t that  market pa rticipant s are  virtually cer tain of a 25- basis -point  incre ase in the
target federal funds rate at the Aug ust meeting.  Nea rly all the primary dealers expect
the Com mittee to retain balanced risk assessmen ts for both grow th and price stability,
and many commented tha t the y expec t it to repe at the  “measured pa ce” l anguage or

.Financial Market Conditions
Financial institutions and markets seemed to have taken the June policy tightening
in stride, with few signs of the volatility and market stress that accompanied the
onset of some past episodes of policy tightening.  A variety of indicators of market
stress—including implied volatilities for equities and long-term bonds, credit
default swap spreads for financial firms, and on-the-run premiums and bid-ask
spreads for Treasury securities—have been fairly steady in recent weeks.  A recent
survey of primary dealers asked the respondents to characterize conditions in long-
and short-term funding markets and interest-rate derivatives markets.  A total of
eighteen dealers responded to the survey.  For both long- and short-term funding
markets, a sizable net percentage of respondents indicated that dealers’ willingness
to act as market makers or underwriters was above normal.  Moreover, about half
of the dealers judged investors’ willingness to bear risk and overall market liquidity
to be normal.  However, several assessed these characteristics as below normal,
hinting at some caution in markets that is not evident in risk and liquidity spreads,
which are relatively narrow.  A few respondents commented that some market
participants were hesitant to take large positions, given expectations for continued
policy tightening.  The net percentage of dealers reporting below-normal liquidity
in interest-rate derivatives markets was somewhat larger than for cash markets,
reportedly reflecting, in part, scaled-back activity of mortgage investors and hedge
funds.official comments early in the period suggesting that policy tightening was not
imminent in Japan and by disappointing sales and production data.  Higher oil prices
and lower earning expectations at Japanese firms also may have contributed to
theweakness in the yen.  The dollar gained ½ percent against the euro over the
intermeeting period, but lost about 2¼ percent versus the Canadian dollar.  Yields on
long-term government bonds in foreign industrial countries declined by amounts that
either matched or were somewhat smaller than the drop in yields on corresponding
U.S. securities.  Foreign equity prices moved down 2 to 6 percent over the period.3

agains t an i ndex of c urrenc ies of our ot her import ant tr ading par tners .  In Br azil, signs
of improvem ent in the dom estic economy, as well as continu ed strong expo rt
performan ce, boosted stock prices and helped  push the real up 2 perce nt ver sus t he
dollar.  Brazil’s EMBI+ spread narrowed 50 basis points to about 6 percentage points. 
The M exican peso also gained slightly versus the do llar, as the Banco de M exico
tightened in l ate July,  citing i nflati on risks.   China’s slower growth and the somewhat
weaker outlook for some major high-te ch firms weighed on share pri ces in Asian
equity markets, and the K orean wo n and the T aiwanese dollar bo th declined
somewhat ver sus t he U.S.  dolla r.  Russ ian financi al marke ts were  roiled by an ongoi ng
dispute between  the governm ent and the cou ntry’s largest oil producer and, for a time,
by runs on several banks.  Russian stock prices fell  almost 6 percent, and  Russia’s
EMBI+ spread  widened so mew hat to about 3¼  percentage points.
(5) In U .S. credit m arkets, gro wth in  overall b usiness d ebt w as subd ued in
the seco nd q uarter, bu t it appea rs to hav e picked  up a little in  July as an  increase in
short-term borrowing more than offset a ne t paydown of corporate bonds (Chart 4 ). 
On a month-avera ge basi s, commercial a nd indust rial (C&I) loans  rose i n both June
and July , the first succes sive months of gr owth sinc e 2001.   On net, about  a thi rd of
the respondents t o the July Senior Loan Officer  Opinion Survey reported that
demand for C&I loans  had incr eased over t he past  three  months, wi th firms indi cating
that t he loan pr oceeds  were use d to fi nance i nventor ies, accounts r eceivable , plant and
equip ment, and m ergers an d acq uisitions.  S upply cond itions likely ar e playing  a role
in the recent growth  of business loans, as significant net fractions of banks reported
easing business credit standards and  terms for the third con secutive survey.  Net
issuance of comm ercial paper, which had tu rned positive in the first half of 2004 after
three  years  of run- offs, jumped in July , likely owing to s ome of the s ame demand
factors  driving C&I lending.  Household borrowing, while st ill bri sk, appear s to have
moderated s omewhat in t he sec ond quarte r, as highe r interest rates wei ghed on

Assessment 
of 
Risk5. The Committee perceives the upside
and downside risks to the attainmentof both sustainable growth and pricestability for the next few quarters areroughly equal.[Unchanged] [Unchanged]
In current circumstances, the Committee believes
that the existing degree of policy accommodation, if
sustained over the next few quarters, could fostereconomic growth that is more likely to be above
than below its long-run su stainable pace.  Similarly,
with respect to the Co mmittee’s goal of price
stability, such an unchanged policy stance impliesgreater risks to the upsi de than the downside.
6. With underlying inflation still
expected to be relatively low, theCommittee believes that policyaccommodation can be removed at apace that is likely to be measured. Nonetheless, the Committee willrespond to changes in economicprospects as needed to fulfill itsobligation to maintain price stability.With underlying inflation still

The first  two alternati ves propose a st ructure of the  announcement fairly cl ose to that
employed  at the last meeting.  Alternative C, how ever, offers a substantial departure
from the f orm and subst ance of  rece nt announce ments.   It involve s an as sessment
that the r isks to gro wth a nd inflatio n are tilted  to the u pside— cond itioned  explicitly
on an unchange d stanc e of pol icy followi ng the ac tion—and eli minati on of the

the ra tiona le section of the  announcement,  the Committee ’s charact eriza tion of  the

by the re lease on  Friday  of the em ploym ent repo rt for July.  If th at repo rt com es in

Altern atives B a nd C , that “labor market con ditions continue to improve.”  However, i f the
report is again on the soft side, as in June, the Co mmittee might wish to cite “some
slowing in the pace of im provement in labor market con ditions,” as in Alternative A.
(9) Althou gh the  recent p ace of economi c gro wth has  been  less vigorous
than proj ected in the  June Greenbook , the Committee may s till judge  that t he
econo my is p oised fo r significan t expan sion go ing forw ard, as in th e curren t staff
forec ast.  Under this  view,  a gradual  tight ening of  monetary pol icy should be
consi stent  with a pac e of gr owth suff icient t o make some headway  in reduc ing
econom ic slack while keeping inflation well contained .  If the Comm ittee subscribes
to such a n outlook,  it may f ind it  appropri ate to conti nue pari ng the deg ree of
monetary policy accommodation and thus be attrac ted to the 25- basis- point fir ming at
this m eeting o f Alternative B .  Policy likely will need to be firmed considerab ly over
time:  The real  federal f unds rate, measured as  the diff erence between the nominal
funds r ate a nd lagge d four- quarte r core  PCE inflat ion, remains  negati ve and bel ow the
estimates of  its equil ibrium value impl ied by s elected st aff models (Char t 5).  And
given re cent inflatio n trend s, as well as th e contin ued clim b in cru de oil p rices in
recent weeks , a further  tight ening of  polic y might be v iewed as  desi rable  to reduc e the
odds of an upturn in infl ation expecta tions and more generally  to help ensure that

core inflation does not rise above accep table levels.  At the same time, the C omm ittee
may believe that a grad ual pace of policy adjustm ent will likely be sufficient to foster
achievement of it s goals,  particula rly given t he apparent persi stence of e conomic slack,
which should help restr ain infl ation.  Also,  the recent dat a may be read as hinting t hat
the sluggishness in spending  of the past few m onths m ight prove m ore protracted
than fo recast in th e Gre enbo ok, argu ing for o nly a m odest firm ing step  at this
meetin g.  Estim ated po licy rules ge nerally su ggest tha t a such a  tightenin g at this
meetin g wo uld b e consisten t with th e Co mmittee’s past po licy cond uct (C hart 6).
(10) In ann ouncing im plem entation  of A lternative B , the Co mmittee wo uld
presum ably w ant to m odify its pr evious s tatem ent that “outp ut is con tinuing to ex pand at a
solid pace”  to acknow ledge both the softness in econ omic activity in the past few
mon ths and the po tential effects  on econo mic prosp ects of energy price
developments.  One way to accomplish this  would be to note that  “Alth ough output
growth ha s moder ated in r ecent month s, the economy appe ars poised to expa nd at a  solid pace going
forward absent sig nificant f urther incre ases in energy pri ces.”  With regard to recent price
devel opments,  core c onsumer inf lation was subdued on a  monthly bas is in June
although the t welve- month infl ation rate  was highe r than a  year e arlier.  The
Comm ittee may wis h to ret ain the sens e of i ts pre vious a nnouncement r egardi ng

“Recent infla tion data have been somewhat elev ated, thou gh a p ortion of th e rise in prices e vidently

the ri sks to the at tainment of s ustai nable gr owth and pri ce stability are bal anced f or

Committ ee on Aug ust 6, 2004 .testimo ny, as im plying th at the FO MC will firm po licy anoth er 25 ba sis points a t this
meeting,  again a ssess the r isks to growth a nd infl ation as bal anced,  and ret ain the
referenc e to a “measured pace.”  Mo reover, a range of indicators continues to su ggest
that i nvest ors gene rally remain wel l prepa red for  gradual  polic y tighteni ng.4  Thus, t he
market reacti on to implementation of this  alternat ive would likel y be rather muted, as
in June.   However, t he mention of  crude oi l prices a s a fa ctor pot entially influenci ng
futur e economic  growth coul d prompt inve stors  to foc us more cl osely on evol ving
energy price developm ents in revising their expectations for mo netary policy.
(12) If the Committee i s conce rned by t he sl ow pace of pr ogress  in reduc ing
resour ce slack proj ected in the  Greenbook or i s worri ed that  the f orecas ted re bound
in growth c ould fa il to materi alize, it may pref er the  unchanged pol icy stance  of
Alternative A .  The  sluggish cons umptio n spe nding  of late and t he st ill-limited pic kup
in capital  investment—even ahead of the expirat ion of the parti al-expensi ng tax
provisio ns at year-e nd— migh t be read  by po licyma kers as su ggesting  that agg regate
demand could re main sof t for some time.   Such concer ns about pr ospect s for
economic a ctivity could i ntensi fy if the  labor mark et report f or July  turns out  to be
surpri singl y weak.   The possi bility th at busi ness a nd consumer con fidence coul d be
impaire d by heig htened t error ist threa ts might  also be  seen a s posi ng some downside
risk to spe nding and out put.  With infl ation apparent ly moving down s omewhat from
its elevated leve ls of earlier this year and inflation expectations apparently co ntained, a
brief  hiatus in t he proce ss of  firming polic y might i nvolve  little risk of hi gher i nflation
and w ould perm it the accu mulation o f additio nal data  that cou ld be h elpful in
assessing whether spending is re bounding in line with projections. 
(13) The ann ouncem ent accomp anying a decision to leave rates unch anged
could  point to  the evid ence o f “a moderation in output growth” and possibly, as men tioned
above,  a slowi ng in the  pace of  improvement i n labor mark et condi tions .  The
inflation sentence could well be similar to that under Alternative B.  If FOMC
10
memb ers are es peciall y concerned that t he recent weakness  in spending might prove
persistent, they might consider an assessm ent that risks to sustainable growth are
weighted to the d ownside.  H owever, the C omm ittee may judge that, especially given
the easing of market interest rates that wou ld likely accompany a n unchan ged policy
stance, the risk s to bo th sustain able gro wth a nd p rice stability w ould rema in in
balanc e.  Ass uming that  the Committee  still sees a  need to move ov er time toward a
neutra l stance,  it pr obably woul d want to r etain in the  announcement t he judgment
that policy  accommod ation can li kely be removed at a “measured pace.”  Consistent w ith
its motivat ion for sel ecting Alternat ive A, the Committee might also wish to note t hat
policy w ill be adju sted as ap prop riate to pr omote “sustainable gr owth”  as well as price
stabi lity in t he las t sent ence of  the ri sk as sessment sec tion.
(14) Unless m arket expectations for the decision at this meeting are altered
substantially by a weak em ploymen t report for July, announcem ent of an unch anged
policy stance wou ld come as a co nsiderable surprise to investors and m ight trigger a
sizab le drop i n short -term inter est rates, a rally in bond pr ices, and s ome depreci ation
in the for eign exc hang e value o f the do llar.  The d rop in  bon d yields w ould tend to
support  equity  price s, but  that i nflue nce coul d be off set if the  polic y announce ment
led invest ors to  believe t hat ec onomic act ivity and corp orate  profi ts were  likely to be
weaker t han previ ously  anticipat ed.  The  decli nes i n market i ntere st rates and in the
dollar w ould likely be ev en m ore pro nounced, an d a fall in eq uity price s mo re likely, if
the FOMC  provide d an ass essment  of net  downside r isks to sus tainable gr owth or
otherwise com mun icated concern abo ut prospective econo mic weak ness.
(15) If the Committee sees t he recent sl ower growth of aggregate demand as
likely to be transitory but suspects that the pickup in co re inflation could well be m ore
durab le than th e staff anticipa tes, it migh t choo se to raise th e fund s rate 50 b asis
points a t this m eeting, as in  Alternative C .  FOMC  members may consi der inf lation
already to  be close to  the top  of an ac ceptab le range  and see  several rea sons to
questi on the dec line in inf lation in the  staff forecast.  With infl ation expect ations
remaini ng in a 2 t o 3 perce nt range , wel l above  the Greenb ook fore cast, the
Comm ittee may bel ieve that unde rlying infl ation has cons idera ble momentum.  Als o,

the Feder al Open  Market  Committ ee from Vinc ent Reinha rt, Augus t 5, 2004.high energy prices m ay prove to be lon ger lasting than anticipated by the staff forecast
and the m arkets, providing less downw ard pressure on o verall inflation.  Policymakers
may see less  slack i n prospect than in t he Greenbook projection, bec ause they may
perceive t he economy as already cl ose to its  potential or  the growth rate of pote ntial
output as  lower t han est imated by  the st aff.  Finally, Committe e members might  be
uneasy  about i nflation pr ospect s if they pl ace less wei ght on the  most rec ent spe nding
indicato rs and fo resee m ore rob ust gro wth in  aggreg ate dem and th an in th e staff
forec ast, perhaps  along t he lines of  the “Spendi ng Rebound” scena rio in the
Greenbook.   In li ght of t hese c onside rations, the FOMC  may judge a 2 5-bas is-point
move at this meeting—which wou ld leave t he real f unds rate in negati ve terri tory—as
insuf ficient, where as a 50 -basi s-poi nt move would at  least bring the r eal rate to around
zero.
(16) With m arket part icipants  interpret ing a “measu red pace”  as implying at
most 25-basis-point m oves, policymakers prob ably wou ld want to alter that phrase
significantly or drop it from an  announcement of Alternative C.  Whi le some
policymakers m ight prefer not to provide g uidance abo ut the likely pace of policy
chang e, they m ay be co mfortable giv ing an  indirect in dication  of its prob able
direc tion.  If so , the last sentence of the  announcement might read: “In current
circumstances, the C ommittee believes that the existing degree of policy accommod ation, if sustained
over the n ext few  quarters, could fos ter econo mic gro wth th at is m ore likely to  be abo ve than  below  its
long-run sustai nable pa ce.  Similarl y, wit h respe ct to the Committee ’s goal of  price stab ility, such an
unchanged policy st ance implies gre ater risks t o the upside than the downside. ” 5  Given the
explicit co ndition ing on  the stanc e of po licy in this asses smen t, a reference to  the role
of monetar y accommodati on in the  first sentenc e of t he rat ional e parag raph would be
redundant.  Th at paragraph might instead begin: “The Comm ittee continues t o believe that
robust underlying growth in productivity is providing ongoing support to eco nomic activ ity.”  If the
Com mittee thinks  that the “sof t patch” in the e conomy is probably behind us and that
12
condi tions a re in pla ce for a r obust  snap -back, it might  also want t o state that  output
growth “appears poised to res ume a str onger pace goin g forw ard.”  To underscor e its conce rns
about the effect of energy price increases on the inflation ou tlook, the Com mittee
might want to say: “Alth ough a por tion of t he rise in inf lation this year appea rs to hav e been due
to transitory factors, continuing a nd subs tantial increases in e nergy prices are p utting persistent
upward pressure on costs a nd overall price s.”
(17) Unless the em ploym ent repo rt for July tu rns ou t to be ex ception ally
strong, market participants w ould be q uite surprised by the com bination of a 50-basis-
point move a nd the announc ement propos ed under Alt ernat ive C.   The ass essment  of
upside risks to grow th and inflation and th e deletion of the “measu red pace”   languag e
would reinforce the s ense that t he trajec tory of poli cy would be steeper t han
previously anticipated.  Ma rket interest rates would likely increase sharply, while stock
prices would d rop and th e foreign exchange valu e of the dollar wou ld rise.
(18) If the Committ ee favors onl y a mode st firming in  policy at this time but
wishes to m ove away from  the “measu red pace” langu age before long, it might w ish
to comb ine the 25-basis-point fi rming a ction and rationale of Alternative  B
with the conditional assessment of upside risks proposed for Alternative C . 
That a ssessme nt wo uld im ply a ne ed for co ntinue d po licy tighten ing an d thu s could
facilitate dropping the measured pace language,  perhaps even at t his meeting.   If that
languag e were dr opped on Tuesday , the market  react ion to t he announce ment of
conditional upside risks cou ld be fairly sharp, approaching that exp ected under
Alterna tive C, as mark et par ticipant s would proba bly conc lude t hat the  FOM C no
longer believed that policy tightening w as likely to be gradual.  But if the “measu red
pace”  wording were  retained f or thi s meeti ng, the res ponse might  be rat her muted,
with perhap s a small rise in market yields and a m odest decline in equity prices.
Money  and  Debt Fo recas ts
(19) Under the Gree nbook proje ction, M2 is e xpect ed to cont inue t o expand
at a subdued pace, ave raging only around 1¼ percent from July through December. 
Histo rical eviden ce indica tes that de posit inte rest rates are lik ely to resp ond sluggish ly
to rising s hort- term market  rates, leading t o a wideni ng of the  opportuni ty cos t of
13
holdin g monetar y assets.  As a  conseq uence , househ olds are  expecte d to sh ift their
portf olios  away fr om deposit s and towar d market i nstrument s.  The  lagge d eff ects on
deposit balances of the con tinuing slowd own in m ortgage refinancing activity are also
expect ed to damp money growt h, but  to decl ining de gree i n the months  ahead.
(20) The growth of  domestic  nonfina ncial  sector debt i s for ecast to s low to a
7 percent pace over  the second half  of this y ear.  Household debt should decel erate as
higher mort gage rates slow r esidential investmen t and ho me pr ice appreciation.  By
contrast, business borrow ing is expected to increase as internal funds fail to keep pace
with rising capital expenditures and  as equity retirements quicken  with increased
merg er activity.  Fed eral deb t grow th is expe cted to m odera te som ewhat from  its
robust fir st half  pace, but budget def icits are project ed to remain sizable.   As the fiscal
positions of state and local governm ents continue to im prove, and w ith long-term
interest rates expec ted to  remain about  flat, growth of s tate and loca l debt  should s low
further.
