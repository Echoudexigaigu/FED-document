MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES  
Recent Developments 
(1) The Committee’s decision at the Novemb er meeting—to increase the target 
federal funds rate 25 basis points to 2 perc ent, to assess the risks to sustainable 
economic growth and price stability as balanced, and to retain the “measured pace” language—had been widely anticipated an d prompted little reaction in financial 
markets.
1  Over the intermeeting period, expectat ions for the path of policy over the 
next year firmed slightly on net (Chart 1), a pparently owing to inflation releases that 
were a bit higher than anticipated, the Chairman’s remarks at the European Banking 
Congress on November 19, dollar depreciation, and the effect of falling oil prices on 
the growth outlook.  This modest firmin g of near-term policy expectations occurred 
even though data on real activity came in a little softer on balance than the market had 
anticipated.  Beyond next year, the expected  trajectory of policy a ppears to have been 
revised down a bit.  Judging from federal funds futures, investors have almost 
completely priced in a quarter-point tightening  at this meeting.  The Desk’s survey of 
primary dealers indicates that they unanimou sly anticipate a quarter-point tightening 
as well as retention of an assessment of balanced risks and the “measured pace” language.  Futures quotes imply that inve stors expect about 50 basis points of 
cumulative tightening over the first thr ee meetings in 2005 and another 25 basis 
points later in the year. 
                                          
 
1 The effective federal funds rate averaged 2.00 percent over the intermeeting period.  The Desk 
expanded the System’s outright holdings of securiti es by $8.6 billion, with purchases of $0.5 billion 
of Treasury bills from foreign official customers an d $2.5 billion of Treasury bills and $5.5 billion of 
Treasury coupon securities from the market.  The volume of outstanding long-term RPs increased 
$3.0 billion, to $20 billion.

(2) The small upward revision in poli cy expectations for the next year 
contributed to a modest rise in yields on  shorter-term Treasury coupon securities.2  
However, longer-term Treasury yields, whic h were buffeted during the period by 
speculation about prospects for foreign offi cial holdings of Treasury securities, 
finished the period 5 to 10 basis points lower, perhaps reflecting in part the weaker-
than-expected data on economic activity.3  Much of the decline in longer-term yields 
was concentrated in forward rates at distant horizons.  The volatility of long-term 
interest rates implied by options prices edge d lower over the period.  TIPS yields fell 
5 to 10 basis points.  Inflation compensation  for the next five years rose slightly, 
extending its advance of the past several months.  Inflation compensation over the 
subsequent five years, however, remained well anchored, and survey measures of 
long-term inflation expectations were little changed. 
(3) Investment-grade corporate bond yields fell somewhat more than those on 
comparable Treasury securities over th e intermeeting period, implying a further 
decline in risk spreads of 5 to 10 basis points (Chart 2).  Speculative-grade spreads 
also edged down.  Market commentary not ed sizable inflows to junk bond mutual 
funds and brisk issuance of speculative-grad e bonds as evidence of strong investor 
appetite for riskier securities.  Spread s on agency debt narrowed slightly despite 
persisting issues regarding GSE accounting and oversight, apparently in response to 
slowing growth of agency balance sheets and speculation that monetary authorities in 
some foreign countries have begun shifting the composition of thei r official portfolios 
away from Treasuries and toward agency  securities.  Investors noted the steep 
increase over recent weeks in agency securiti es held in custody at the Federal Reserve 
Bank of New York as evidence in support of  this hypothesis.  Year-end pressures in 
                                           
2 The expectations hypothesis of the term structure im plies that about half of the rise in the two-year 
yield over this intermeeting period had been expect ed at the time of the November meeting and so 
does not reflect revisions to policy expectations. 
3 The Treasury debt ceiling was binding early in the intermeeting period, but this had limited market 
repercussions, and the ceiling was subsequently raised on November 18.

money markets have been subdued so far th is year (see box).  Major equity indexes 
ended the period up 1½ to 4 percent, buoy ed in part by falling oil prices, while 
implied volatility on equities decl ined a little further.     
 
(4) For most of the intermeeting period, the dollar continued its recent 
downward trend even though new data fr om major foreign industrial countries 
generally suggested somewhat more tepid economic growth than had been expected 
(Chart 3).   Toward the end of the period, the dollar registered a sharp uptick, but for 
the period as a whole it lost about 1 percent versus a basket of other major currencies.  Year-end Pressures 
Year-end funding pressures have been subdued so far this year.  These pressures were 
negligible in 2003 but had been substantial in previous years.  As shown in the bottom left panel, the spread of yields on thirty-day A2/P2 commercial paper over A1/P1 paper was 
little changed as the maturity of the paper cro ssed over year-end.  The spread of one-month 
term federal funds over Treasury RP rates (the bottom right panel) rose about 20 basis points as the maturity crossed into the new year, but th is spread has since come back down.  Quotes 
on federal funds futures imply that the effecti ve federal funds rate over year-end is not 
anticipated to depart much from the ma rket’s expectation of a 2¼ percent target. 
The strengthening of business sector credit quality and the sharp decline in the amount of 
outstanding commercial paper over the last few years have likely reduced the premium  
investors require to hold lower-rated paper over the turn of the year.  Year-end pressures in uncollateralized overnight funding markets may have been tempered by the slightly below-
target effective federal funds rates at the end of 2002 and 2003, coupled with the very low 
level of volatility of the funds rate in recent years.

Negative views on the dollar appeared to owe mainly to market participants’ 
increasing focus on the financial implicatio ns of the U.S. current account deficit.  
Adding downward pressure were news report s that the monetary authorities in China 
and Russia may be replacing some of thei r dollar holdings with euros.  The dollar’s 
descent against the euro and yen provoked several statements by European and Japanese officials of their readiness to inte rvene.       
   .  On 
balance, the dollar depreciated about 1¾ percent against the yen and 2¾ percent 
against the euro.  In contrast, the dollar moved up 2¼ percent versus the Canadian 
dollar, reflecting lower oil prices and recen t data showing weaker Canadian exports 
and employment.  The signs of slower grow th in major foreign industrial countries 
were reflected in declines of about 5 to 30 basis points in yiel ds on most long-term 
government bonds, while stock prices moved in narrow ranges.   (5) The dollar also depreciated 1¼ per cent against currencies of our other 
important trading partners during the inte rmeeting period.  The dollar fell 5 percent 
versus the Korean won, and the Bank of Korea cut its policy rate 25 basis points.  
Korea reported a large increase in its foreig n exchange reserves that was attributed to 
intervention operations aimed at blunting th e impact of the won’s rise on domestic 
economic growth.  The dollar also depreciat ed versus several other Asian currencies, 
notably including the Taiwan dollar and Th ai baht.  The Bank of Mexico once again 
tightened monetary policy to restrain inflat ion, and the dollar fell 1¼ percent against 
the peso.  Although the pace of growth in  Brazil appears to ha ve slowed somewhat, 
financial markets continued to reward th at country’s improved economic performance 
this year.  Brazilian stock prices climbed 4½ percent more during the intermeeting 
period, and Brazil’s EMBI+ spread narro wed 40 basis points.  Concerns about 
inflationary pressures prompted the Brazilia n central bank to tighten monetary policy 
 - 5 -
in mid-November for the third time in the past four months.  Over the intermeeting 
period, the dollar fell about 1¼ percent against the real. 
(6) Domestic nonfinancial business-sector debt grew at about a 5 percent 
annual rate in the third quarter and appears to have accelerated in the current quarter.  
Net issuance of corporate bonds, especially t hose with speculative grades, rose smartly 
in November, spurred in part by a pickup in  merger and acquisition activity (Chart 4).  
Short-term business borrowing, however, turn ed negative, with a sizable runoff in 
commercial paper offsetting a modest increase in C&I loans at banks.  Household 
mortgage debt grew at a rapid pace in th e third quarter and, given the sustained 
strength in home sales, likely has continued to expand briskly in the current quarter.  
Federal debt is estimated to be surging at  a 10 percent pace in the fourth quarter.  
Total domestic nonfinancial sector debt appears to be advancing at about an 8 percent 
annual rate in the fourth quarter, the same pace as in 2004 as a whole.  (7) M2 rose at about a 6¼ percent annual rate in November, up from  
2½ percent in October.  This aggregate ap pears to be expanding a bit more slowly 
than nominal income in the fourth quarter, in line with the slight increase in the 
opportunity cost of holding M2 assets.  Re tail money funds, in particular, have been 
weak as investors evidently have found alte rnative investments, such as Treasury bills 
and bond and stock funds, more attractive.  Inflows to equity funds are estimated to 
have picked up in November, following the up ward trend in stock prices over the past 
few months.  For 2004 as a whole, M2 is es timated to have expanded 5¼ percent, and 
its velocity appears to have risen about 1 percent as opportunity costs increased.  
Appendix B analyzes the growth of mone y and the debt of domestic nonfinancial 
sectors this year.

Policy Alternatives  
(8) Since the publication of the Nove mber Greenbook, incoming data on 
spending and employment have been a bit stronger on balance than the staff had 
anticipated, and the outlook for near-term economic activity has been marked up as a 
result.4  Moreover, the recent rise in equity pri ces, declines in oil prices and the foreign 
exchange value of the dollar, and unexpected ly large gains in home prices are carried 
forward in level terms in the projection, providing a noticeable boost to aggregate 
demand.  Equity prices are assumed to rise  at a rate yielding risk-adjusted returns 
similar to those on fixed-income investme nts; oil prices are projected to decline 
somewhat further, in line with futures quo tes; the dollar is expected to depreciate 
gradually from its current lower level; an d the pace of house pr ice appreciation is 
forecast to slow to more modest rates in coming quarters.  The stimulus to spending 
from these factors is offset, in part, by a higher projected path for the federal funds 
rate, with the Committee now assumed to rais e the funds rate to 2¾ percent by the 
end of 2005 and 3¼ percent by the end of 2006, in both cases 50 basis points higher 
than in the November Greenbook.  The projected path for the ten-year Treasury yield has been marked up a bit as well.  Long-term yields are expected to be roughly steady 
over the projection period, with the effects of  rising short-term rates largely offset by 
reductions in expected future short rates as inflation pressures prove to be more 
subdued than currently anticipated by inve stors.  Against this financial backdrop, 
GDP growth averages a bit less than 4 perc ent over 2005 and 2006, about the same as 
for this year.  With potential output expanding at nearly a 3¼ percent pace, the 
unemployment rate edges down to about 5 percent, the staff’s estimate of the 
NAIRU, by the end of 2006, and the output gap is essentially clos ed.  The effects on 
                                          
 
4 The discussion in this paragraph is based on deve lopments since the public ation of the November 
Greenbook.  Of particular note, the employment report for October, which was released between 
Greenbook publication and the November FOMC m eeting, was appreciably more robust than had 
been anticipated in the November staff forecast.

prices of the modest slack in resource marke ts in the interim are offset by the pass-
through of this year’s rise in energy prices, and core PCE inflation is forecast to remain near 1½ percent in 2005 and 2006.  However, with energy prices on a 
downward track, overall PCE inflation falls back from 2½ percent this year to about 
1¼ percent in 2005 and 2006. (9) This Bluebook presents three alternat ives for the Committee’s consideration 
(see Table 1).  Under Alternative B, the fede ral funds rate would rise 25 basis points, 
but the statement would imply that the Comm ittee saw a distinct possibility of a pause 
in tightening at an upcoming meeting.  Alternative C also envisions a 25-basis-point 
tightening, but the accompanying statement would give no indication that a pause was 
likely.  In all three cases, the description of labor market conditions in the rationale 
paragraph has been adjusted in light of th e incoming data.  In Alternative A, the 
federal funds rate would remain at 2 percent.   Similarly, under all three alternatives, 
the Committee is assumed to retain both an assessment that the risks to its goals of 
stable prices and maximum sustainable growth are balanced and the “measured pace” 
language contained in the last several statements. 
(10) If the Committee views developments over the intermeeting period as 
having provided further evidence that the ex pansion is solidly on track, then it might 
be inclined to continue removing po licy accommodation at a measured pace by 
tightening policy another 25 basis points at this meeting.  Shou ld the Committee also 
expect that substantial further tightening wi ll be desirable fairly soon, then it might 
want to issue a statement such as that in Alternative C , which does not hint at a 
possible pause in tightening at coming meet ings.  Despite the four policy moves over 
the past several months, the real federal funds rate remains below the lower end of 
the 70 percent confidence band around the es timates of the short-run equilibrium real 
interest rate derived using the staff’s new me thods.  The current rate is also below the 
estimate of the equilibrium rate that is im plicit in the Greenbook forecast.  (See the

box entitled “New Estimates of the Equi librium Real Rate” and Chart 5.)  These 
revised estimates may suggest that a somewh at more rapid and substantial tightening 
than previously perceived may be require d to remove policy accommodation and head 
off a buildup of inflationary pressures.  In addition, members may anticipate more 
slowing in the underlying pace of productivi ty growth than does the staff.  Such a 
development would add to upward pressure  on unit labor costs, and hence on overall 
inflation rates.  Also, the Committee may be lieve that effective labor market slack 
going forward could turn out to be quite limited—for example, if labor market 
participation, which has yet to turn distinctly higher, fails to increase as much as in the staff forecast.  In either case, the Commi ttee might anticipate that aggregate demand 
will continue to expand at a pace above that of its potential for some time and 
consequently deem considerable further pr ogress toward a more neutral policy stance 
desirable over coming months.  Alternat ive C would also seem appropriate if 
members were concerned that longer-term inflation expectations could move higher were the Committee not seen as responding sufficiently to inflationary impulses 
emanating from the decline in the dollar and the previous rise in oil prices. 
(11) The statement in Alternative C could be quite similar to that released 
following the November meeting.  In light of the relatively soft employment report 
for November, however, the announcement could indicate that labor market 
conditions “ continue to improve gradually.”   Also, in view of the significant decline in oil 
prices in recent weeks, the clause on ou tput could be revised to refer to the “earlier”  
rise in energy prices.  The general similari ty of the language to that employed in 
November and the continued characterization of the policy stance as “accommodative”  
would avoid the suggestion that the Committee believes a pause in policy tightening is 
likely in the near term.  As drafted, the statement retains a balanced assessment of 
risks to sustainable growth and price st ability—an assessment that some members 
might see as conditioned on an appropriate path for policy going forward—as well as 
  New Estimates of the Equilibrium Real Federal Funds Rate 
This Bluebook introduces new estimates of the equilibrium real federal funds rate.  
The new estimates were developed to addr ess shortcomings of the earlier measures 
that, as reported in the Bluebook Readership Survey, made them difficult to interpret.1  
One problem with the earlier measures was that the concept underlying the measures 
was not defined clearly.  For example, th e time horizon—the period over which the 
output gap would be projected to close if  the real funds rate were kept at its 
equilibrium level—differed across measures an d was not clearly speci fied.  Second, the 
chart summarizing the various measures may have given a misleading picture of the 
uncertainty surrounding the point estimates.   Finally, the two-sided estimates that 
were included would seem to be ina ppropriate for real-time policymaking. 
The new chart reports two kinds of equilib rium rate measures, differing in terms 
of their time horizon.  The short-run equilibrium  rate is defined to be the rate that, if 
sustained, would be projected to close th e output gap in twelve quarters.  The 
medium-run measure is defined to be the rate projected to prevail in seven years 
under the assumption that monetary policy w ill act to eliminate economic slack in 
three years and to hold output at potenti al thereafter.  The new estimates are 
calculated based on three different models: a single-equation model of the output gap, 
a small structural model consisting of equa tions for five key macroeconomic variables, 
and the staff’s large-scale model (FRB/US) .  In addition to the range encompassing 
the point estimates of the three models, the chart also displays confidence bands that 
illustrate the uncertainties surrounding the ra nge of model estimates.  Also shown are 
the Greenbook-consistent measure of the shor t-run equilibrium rate—which is based 
on a version of the FRB/US model that has been adjusted to match the Greenbook 
forecast—and the medium-run equilibrium rate consistent with TIPS yields.  
The new model-based estimates shown in this Bluebook suggest a higher current 
level for the equilibrium real federal funds rate than did the range based on the old methods that was included in the November Bluebook.  This difference occurs mainly 
because we have dropped the measures base d on the statistical-filter model, which 
exhibited implausibly large responses to  surprises in output.  The Greenbook-
consistent measure currently yields an equilibrium rate lower than model-based 
estimates because the Greenbook projects th at the recent weakness in aggregate 
demand will diminish more grad ually than the models predict. 
It should be noted that the appropriate st ance of policy relative to the equilibrium 
estimates in a given instance will depe nd on policymakers’ objectives and the 
projected paths for output and inflation.  Th us, these estimates of the equilibrium rate 
should not be interpreted as policy prescripti ons, but rather as potential inputs to the 
policy process.

details are provided in Flint Brayto n and David Reifschneider, “Revised Bluebook Estimates of the Equilibrium 
Real Rate – Overview,” and “Revised Bluebook Es timates of the Equilibrium Real Rate – Technical

Equ ilibrium R eal Rate Ch art: Explanatory  Notes
The equilibrium real rate is the real feder al funds rate that, if maintained, would be projected to return
output to its  potentia l level ov er time.  T he short- run equil ibrium ra te is defi ned as the  rate tha t would
be anticipated to close the output gap in twelve quarter s, and the medium-run concept is the value of
the real funds rate projected to keep output at potential in seve n years unde r the assumption that
monetary policy  acts to bring actual and potential output into line in the short run and then keep them
equal thereafter.  With the exception of the TI PS-consistent measure, the real federal funds ra tes
employ the log diff erence of the core PCE price index over the pr evious four quarters as a proxy  for
expected inflation, with the staff projection used for the current qua rter.  TIPS indexation is based on
the total CPI. 
Measure Description
Singl e-Equati on
Model The measure of the equilibri um real rate  in the si ngle-equati on model is based on an
estimated aggregate- demand  relat ionship between the current  value of t he output gap
and i ts lagged v alues as well  as the lagge d val ues o f the re al fede ral funds  rate.  In light
of this  model’s sim ple str uctu re, the  short-run  measure of th e equilib rium  real rate
depends  only  on the  recent position of  output  relative to pot ential, and t he medi um-r un
measure is virtu ally con stant.

the “measured pace” language.  If the Comm ittee nonetheless thought the margins of 
unused capacity could be relatively narro w and wanted to convey somewhat greater 
concern about the inflation outlook, it might do so by noting in the rationale 
paragraph that labor market conditions “conti nue to improve,” without indicating that 
the improvement was gradual, and that “the  earlier rise in energy prices and an 
escalation of business costs have the potenti al to contribute to upward pressure on 
prices.”     
(12)     Market participants have essentially  priced in a 25-basis-point rise in the 
federal funds target at this meeting and anticipate only relatively small changes in the statement.  As a result, an announcement lik e that in Alternative C would likely have 
little effect on financial marke ts.  However, a statement that included a reference to 
possible inflation pressures would presumably  lead investors to boost their expected 
path for the federal funds rate , increasing real and nominal interest rates and weighing 
on stock prices.  Such a statement would also  likely raise the sensitivity of market 
participants to inflation news over the intermeeting period.  
(13) The Committee may believe that, as in  the Greenbook fo recast, fostering 
sustainable economic growth and price stab ility will likely involve continued policy 
tightening but at a less rapid pace going fo rward than has been the case over the past 
six months.  For example, members may expect only gradual diminution of the 
business caution that has damped the eco nomic expansion over the last few years 
despite unusually accommodative monetary policy.  If the Committee held such a 
view, it might want to couple a 25-basis-po int move at this meeting with a statement 
like that in Alternative B , which is intended to signal the possibility of a pause in the 
adjustment of policy before long.  While an  additional hike in rates at this meeting 
would be consistent with a number of stan dard policy rules (Chart 6), some of those 
rules also suggest a pause fairly soon if output and inflation evolve as projected in the Greenbook.  Indeed, another 25 basis points of tightening at this meeting would bring

the real federal funds rate to the lower edge  of the 70 percent confidence band for the 
model-based estimates of the short-run equi librium rate and only about ½ percentage 
point below the equilibrium measure consis tent with the Greenbook.  Money market 
futures rates suggest that market participants already place some probability on a 
slowing in the rate of policy tightening, bu t if the Committee saw a pause before long 
as fairly likely it might want to conv ey that expectation at this meeting.   
(14) The possibility of a pause in the tightening process could be signaled by 
noting in the statement that “the Committee’s policy actions si nce mid-2004 have resulted in a 
significant reduction in the degree of monetary policy accommodation.” 5  The statement could go 
on to say that “Nonetheless, . . . the stance of po licy remains somewhat accommodative” rather 
than characterizing the current stance of po licy simply as “accommodative” as in the 
November statement.  The reference to the reduction in policy accommodation 
would suggest to investors that Committee members were considering the effects of 
the cumulative policy adjustment to date, and that, with policy now viewed as only 
“somewhat” accommodative, policymakers might be ready to slow the pace of 
firming.  However, a statement along th ese lines would leave open the option of 
tightening again at the February meeting if incoming information suggested that 
another move was appropriate.  For example, the Committee pointed to the cumulative easing of policy in its June 2001  statement, but it nonetheless eased policy 
further at its August meeting. 
                                          
 
5 Another option under Alternative B would be fo r the Committee to indicate that “The Federal 
Open Market Committee decided today to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 2¼ percent, bringing the cumulative in crease in the target rate over the past several 
months to 1¼ percentage point.”  (Analogous lang uage was presented in the November Bluebook.)  
Such a quantification of the cumulative increase  in the funds rate would be another means of 
suggesting that the FOMC was considering an adjust ment to the policy trajectory going forward, and 
indeed the Committee adopted such an approach in its June 2001 statement.  A disadvantage of this wording is that on its face it would appear to be nothing more than a simple arithmetic statement.  Also, if the Committee elected not to pause in Februa ry, it would be necessary either to update the 
arithmetic by changing the reference from 1¼ pe rcentage points to 1½ percentage points or to 
rewrite the statement more substantially.  
 - 11 -
(15) The release of the announcement for Al ternative B would likely lead to 
some easing of financial cond itions.  Although investors have priced in a 25-basis-
point increase in the target federal funds rate  at this meeting, they do not anticipate 
that the statement will signal the possibilit y of a pause.  As a result, the statement 
could well induce investors to mark down their expected path for the federal funds rate over coming quarters.  Short- and inte rmediate-term interest rates would decline 
some, and the foreign exchange value of th e dollar would probably also fall.  Stock 
prices would likely rise a bit.    
(16) If the Committee were concerned that maintenance of current financial 
conditions could risk a return to subpa r economic performance, it might want to 
consider a pause in the tightening  cycle at this meeting, as in Alternative A .  Recent 
data and anecdotal reports suggest that businesses remain unusually cautious in 
expanding payrolls.  In addition, the expira tion of the partial expensing provision at 
year-end could slow investment spending more than in the Greenbook.  Moreover, 
household saving rates remain very low by historical standards, and a larger-than-
expected rebound in saving propensit ies could damp household spending 
considerably.  Given these uncertainties, and with 100 basis poi nts of tightening 
already in place, the Committee might consider  it prudent to stand pat at this meeting 
to foster easier financial market conditions and weigh incoming data before 
considering the appropriate course for policy in February.  
(17) The announcement of Alternative A could look much like the one released 
following the November meeting.  However,  in view of the concerns about renewed 
economic weakness that presumably woul d motivate policymakers to adopt this 
alternative, the Committee might wish to ch aracterize the current stance of policy as 
only “somewhat accommodative”  and indicate that “labor market conditions  have been improving 
only gradually, apparently evidencing  continued business caution.”  The statement could also 
note policymakers’ obligation to promote “sustainable growth”  as well as price stability.  
 - 12 -
The announcement of this policy choice would surprise investors, and real and 
nominal interest rates would likely decline,  especially at shorter maturities, putting 
downward pressure on the dollar.  Stock pr ices might rise, although the sense that 
aggregate demand might be weaker than inve stors had perceived could lead them to 
revise down their outlook for profits, tendin g to offset the positive effect of lower 
interest rates on equity prices. 
Money and Debt Forecasts 
(18)  Under the staff forecast, M2 decelerates from 5¼ percent growth this year 
to 2 percent in 2005, reflecting slower expa nsion in nominal inco me as well as the 
effects of past and projected policy tighte ning on the opportunity cost of holding M2 
assets.  With the pace of policy tighteni ng assumed to slow through 2005 and 2006, 
and nominal income growth steady at 5½ pe rcent, M2 advances at a 3½ percent pace 
in 2006.  Domestic nonfinancial sector debt is expected to decelerate over the forecast 
period, primarily reflecting some slowing in household debt growth as diminishing 
gains in home prices damp the increase in  residential mortgage debt.  By contrast, 
business debt growth is projected to rise  to a moderate pace next year as capital 
spending expands and to remain near that ra te in 2006.  Federal debt growth slows 
next year but rebounds in 2006, reflecting in part the introduction of Medicare 
prescription drug coverage.

Directive and Balance-of-Risks Statement 
(19) Draft language for the directive and draf t risk assessments identical to those 
presented in Table 1 are provided below. 
(1) Directive Wording 
The Federal Open Market Committee  seeks monetary and financial 
conditions that will foster price st ability and promote sustainable growth 
in output.  To further its long-r un objectives, the Committee in the 
immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with MAINTAINING/increasing/REDUCING the federal funds rate 
AT/to an average of around _______ 2
 percent. 
(2) Risk Assessments  
A. The Committee perceives the upside and downside risks to the 
attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability for the next few 
quarters to be roughly equal.  With underlying inflation expected to be 
relatively low, the Committee believe s that policy accommodation can be 
removed at a pace this is likely to  be measured.  Nonetheless, the 
Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to 
fulfill its obligation to promote pri ce stability and sustainable growth. 
B. The Committee perceives the upside and downside risks to the 
attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability for the next few 
quarters to be roughly equal.  With underlying inflation expected to be 
relatively low, the Committee believe s that policy accommodation can be 
removed at a pace that is likely to be measured.  Nonetheless, the Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to 
fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability.

Note. P* is defined to equal M2 times V* divided by potential GDP. Long-run velocity (V*) is estimated from
1959:Q1 to 1989:Q4. V* after 1992 is estimated from 1993:Q1 to present. For the forecast period, P* is based
on staff M2 forecast and P is simulated using a short-run dynamic model relating P to P*. Vertical lines
mark crossing of P and P*. Shaded areas denote projection period.1965 1968 1971 1974 1977 1980 1983 1986 1989 1992 1995 1998 2001 2004 40 60 80100120140Ratio Scale Price Level

Appendix B: Review of Debt and Money Growth in 2004 
 
 Total debt of domestic nonfinancial s ectors expanded about 8 percent in 2004, 
somewhat faster than nominal income.  Growth was strongest in the household and 
federal sectors, both of which posted almost  10 percent gains.  The rapid pace of 
household borrowing in 2004 reflected a sh arp rise in mortgages that was supported 
by substantial increases in home prices and continued low levels of long-term interest 
rates.  The sizable increase in Treasury debt  was needed to finance the federal deficit, 
while state and local governments again issued  a considerable volume of securities.   
 
Nonfinancial business borrowing, while not  quite as weak as in 2003, continued 
to be restrained this year, as corporations  again relied heavily on elevated profits and 
substantial cash holdings to finance increa sed fixed and inventory investment.  Over 
the year as a whole, nonfinancial corporat ions are estimated to have raised only 
enough funds in credit markets to offset the cash drain from equity retirements.  M2 
expanded roughly in line with nominal GDP in the first half of the year, but growth 
slowed over the second half, owing in pa rt to a decline in mortgage refinancing 
activity and increased opportuni ty costs of holding M2.   
 
Domestic Nonfinancial Sector Debt 
 
Credit supply conditions in the busine ss sector seemed quite accommodative 
amid signs of improving credit quality of n onfinancial firms.  With strong corporate 
earnings, the delinquency rate on C&I loan s declined further, and the six-month 
trailing default rate on outstanding bonds fell to historically low levels.  Also, the pace 
of net upgrades of bond ratings by M oody’s for both investment- and speculative-
grade debt showed some improvement compar ed to 2003 on balance.  Expected year-
ahead default rates calculated by KMV rema ined steady this year after falling from 
their 2002 peak last year.  Against this  backdrop, spreads of investment-grade 
corporate yields over comparable Treasury yi elds remained at low levels, while spreads 
on speculative-grade debt declined further on net.  
 
According to results from the Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey over the 
course of the year, commercial banks eased terms and standards on business loans, 
reflecting an improved economic outlook as well as increased competition among 
banks and nonbank lenders.  Survey response s also indicated that increased demand 
for C&I loans was driven by the need to fund  rising accounts recei vable, inventories, 
capital expenditures, and merger activity.  In the syndicated loan market, spreads on 
leveraged deals edged down and remained low, apparently reflecting moderating 
concerns over loan quality.

The timing of gross bond issuance during  2004 was influenced by interest rate 
movements during the year, as firms took ad vantage of dips in longer-term yields to 
issue bonds.  Firms used a large portion of the proceeds to pay down existing debt, 
and some of the funds raised were also re portedly used to repurchase shares or 
finance mergers.  Net corporate bond issuan ce was sluggish for the year, as firms 
evidently relied heavily on profits and liquid a ssets to fund investment in fixed capital 
and inventories. 
 
Short-term business borrowing revived in 2004 after three years of sharp 
contraction.  Commercial paper outstanding expanded in the first half and continued 
to grow later in the year, reflecting increase d merger activity.  Bu siness loans at banks 
also rebounded in 2004.  Loan s outstanding fell early in the year, albeit at a noticeably 
slower pace than in 2003, edged up in the second quarter for the first time in more 
than three years, increased solidly in the third quarter, and appear likely to post 
another gain in the current quarter.   
 
Even though vacancy rates for nonresidential commercial properties remained 
high and rents continued to fall, commercial mortgages grew at a rapid pace in 2004.  
Some firms reportedly continued to find mo rtgages an attractive source of long-term 
funding.  Considerable gains in commercial re al estate prices increased owners’ equity 
and largely kept pace with the sizable in crease in mortgage debt obligations.  
Delinquency rates on commercial mortgages held by banks and insurance companies 
remained very low throughout the year.  Delinquencies on commercial-mortgage-
backed securities (CMBS) fell during 2004, and yield spre ads of CMBS over 
comparable Treasury securities remained lo w, suggesting that investors have limited 
concerns about loan quality.  Reflecting in part the favo rable pricing, issuance of 
CMBS reached near-record levels.   
 
Household debt rose at a robust pace th is year.  Mortgage debt grew quite 
rapidly again, as activity remained str ong in housing markets and home prices 
continued to rise briskly.  The share of ne w mortgages with adjustable interest rates, 
including hybrids, rose on balance.  Consum er credit growth remained moderate and 
was probably restrained by paydowns us ing proceeds from cash-out mortgage 
refinancing this year, even though the pace  of such transactions has fallen off from 
the near-record pace set early in 2003.  Intere st rates on consumer loans began to rise 
in the middle of the year, a development that may have damped consumer debt 
growth over the past few months. 
 
Nonetheless, historically low interest ra tes and strong growth in disposable 
personal income have apparently helped to  keep financial obligations manageable for 
 - 17 -
most households, as credit quality measures  remained solid.  The aggregate household 
financial obligations ratio was steady, on balance, over the first three quarters of 2004.  
Meanwhile, delinquency rates on various ty pes of household loans at commercial 
banks declined over the same period, while those on auto loans at captive finance 
companies changed little.  Household bank ruptcy filings have been running about 5 
percent below the elevated levels in 200 3, although they remain above the rates 
posted in previous years. 
 
Strong increases in home prices contin ued to boost household net worth, while 
stock prices rose on balance for the year.  Gains in assets about matched the increase 
in household debt, and the ratio of household  net worth to dispos able income rose a 
bit further above its long-run average.  Af ter surging in the first quarter, inflows to 
equity mutual funds moderated before tickin g up in November.  The assets of retail 
and institutional money market mutual funds continued to decline in the second half 
of the year, as their yields lagged increa ses in market interest rates.  On balance, 
inflows into mutual funds were  roughly consistent with sta ff models that link flows to 
asset returns.   
 
With budget positions improving, ne t debt issuance by state and local 
governments edged down from the rapid pa ce set in 2003.  Following widespread 
financial distress and downgrades over the previous two years, the credit quality of 
municipal borrowers stabilized in early 2004 and began to improve later in the year, as 
upgrades of municipal bonds outpaced do wngrades beginning in February.   
 
After borrowing heavily in 2003, owing to  higher spending and large tax cuts, 
the pace of Treasury borrowing moderated this  year.  As was the case in debt-ceiling 
episodes in the previous two years, the Trea sury was forced to resort to accounting 
devices and suspended issuance of state and lo cal government series (SLGS) securities 
when the statutory debt ceiling became a constraint in the fall.  Apart from a 
postponed four-week bill auction, there was little disruption in financial markets, and 
Congress raised the ceiling from $7.4 tri llion to $8.1 trillion shortly after the 
November 2 elections.   
 
The average maturity of outstanding Trea sury debt continued to increase, as 
the Treasury tilted its issu ance toward longer-term securi ties.  The Treasury also 
boosted issuance of inflation-indexed securi ties by introducing a new twenty-year 
inflation-protected bond in July and a five- year inflation-protected note in October.  
Indirect bidding at Treasury auctions, whic h includes bidding by the Federal Reserve 
Bank of New York on behalf of foreign offi cial institutions, remained robust over the 
year.  Indeed, Treasury securi ties held in custody at the Federal Reserve Bank of New 
York on behalf of foreign official instit utions increased abou t $200 billion through 
 - 18 -
November.  Also, Treasury International Capital data through the end of the third 
quarter showed a steady increase in holdings of Treasury securities by foreign official 
and private investors, partic ularly those in Japan.  
 
Bank Credit 
 
 Commercial bank credit is estimated to have grown about 9 percent in 2004, a 
brisker pace than last year.  Bank credit  growth outpaced that of total domestic 
nonfinancial debt.  Growth in mortga ge and home equity loans on banks’ books 
remained brisk.  Following several years of runoffs, business loans began to expand in 
the second half of the year.  Underlying growth of consumer loans was sluggish, but 
was boosted by a reclassification of securiti es in the third quarter.  Correspondingly, 
the expansion of banks’ securities portfolio s slowed during the second half of the 
year.   
 
Monetary Aggregates 
 
M2 advanced at a pace roughly in line wi th nominal GDP during the first half 
of the year.  A resurgence of mortgage refi nancing following the first-quarter decline 
in mortgage rates likely boosted liquid depo sit growth, as proceeds from refinancing 
were temporarily placed in deposit accounts  pending disbursement to the holders of 
mortgage-backed securities.   
M2 growth slowed in the second half of  the year in response to a decline in 
mortgage refinancing activity and the incr eased opportunity cost of holding M2 assets 
that resulted from higher short-term market interest rates.  On balance, M2 growth 
from the fourth quarter of 2003 to the fourth quarter of this year is estimated at about 
5¼ percent.  The velocity of M2 edged up, on net, over the year, roughly in line with 
the historical relationships among money, income, and opportunity cost.
