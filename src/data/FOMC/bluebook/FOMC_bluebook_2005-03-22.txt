MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES  
Recent Developments 
(1) Market participants universally anti cipated the FOMC’s decision at its 
February meeting to increase the target  federal funds rate 25 basis points to 
2½ percent, to continue to assess the ri sks to sustainable economic growth and price 
stability as balanced, and to retain the “measured pace” language.1  As a result, the 
market reaction to the announcement was qui te muted, as was the case with the 
publication three weeks later of the minutes of the meeting.  In the interim, however, Chairman Greenspan’s monetary policy test imony, which was sile nt as to whether 
policy tightening would continue to be meas ured, led market participants to mark up 
their expected path for policy.  Policy expectations were boosted further by heightened inflation concerns sparked by in creases in the prices of energy and other 
commodities and incoming economic data, es pecially the higher-than-expected core 
readings on PPI and PCE inflation.  Judg ing from federal funds futures quotes and 
the Desk’s most recent survey of primary dealers, investors once again are virtually 
certain of a 25 basis point increase in the target federal funds rate at the upcoming 
meeting and generally expect only minor chan ges to the statement (Chart 1).  Futures 
prices indicate a mean expectation for the federal funds rate of 3¼ percent by July, 
about ¼ percentage point higher than expected  at the time of the February meeting.  
Options prices imply that investors now se e a pause as less likely than they did in 
                                          
 
1 The average effective federal funds rate was very close to the target over most of the 
intermeeting period.  Late in the period, the funds rate averaged somewhat above target in 
response to the anticipation of another tightening  move by the FOMC at this meeting.  The 
Desk redeemed $333 million of Treasury coupons and purchased no bills or coupon 
securities.  The volume of outstanding long-ter m RPs increased $1 billion, to $17 billion.

February and a 50 basis point move at one of the next three meetings as somewhat 
more likely.  Current futures quotes sugges t an expected federal funds rate of about 
4¼ percent at the end of 2006, 50 basis poi nts higher than at the time of the last 
meeting. 
(2) Consistent with this upward revisi on to policy expectations, the two-year 
nominal Treasury yield gained 45 basis point s over the intermeeting period.  Ten-year 
yields rose almost as much—and probably mo re than can be accounted for solely by 
the revision to policy expectations—perhaps  as investors reevaluated fixed-income 
pricing in light of the Chairman’s characte rization of the low level of long-rates 
prevailing in mid-February as a “conund rum” and as doubts surfaced about the 
continued willingness of foreign investors to  add to their holdings of dollar assets.  
Concerns about inflation seemed to incr ease as well, with ten-year inflation 
compensation measured from TIPS rising about 25 basis points.  However, the 
forward-rate structure of inflation compen sation indicates that this increase was 
concentrated over the next two years.  Infl ation compensation five to ten years ahead 
rose only 10 basis points over the intermeetin g period, and survey measures of longer-
term expectations were about unchanged. (3) Investment-grade private yields increased a bit less than comparable-
maturity Treasury yields, leaving spreads a fe w basis points lower (Chart 2).  Yields on 
speculative-grade bonds, in contrast, moved up only a little, implying that their spread 
over Treasuries fell about 35 basis poin ts.  Corporate balance sheets are generally 
healthy, and indicators of business credit quality are favorable; still, current yield spreads seem to provide very little compensati on for risk relative to historical norms.  
In recent days, profit warnings by Ge neral Motors and accompanying debt 
downgrades pushed up GM credit default swap premiums and sent GM stock prices 
lower.  Despite GM’s troubles and increase s in bond yields and energy prices, broad 
stock indexes edged up over the interm eeting period, although the Nasdaq index

declined 2½ percent.  Implied volatility of stock prices, as well as of interest rates, 
remained low (see box).   (4) The trade-weighted foreign exchange  value of the dollar against major 
currencies declined 2¼ percent on balance ov er the intermeeting period (Chart 3).  
The dollar appreciated for several days following the Chairman’s speech on the current account on February 4, which man y analysts interpreted as expressing 
diminished concern about the adjustment of th e U.S. external deficit.  However, that 
move proved short-lived; sometimes-contradictory news stories and reports about possible diversification away from dollar as sets—including statements by authorities 
in Japan, Taiwan, and Korea—seemed to contribute to the dollar’s subsequent 
decline.
2  Late in the period, the release of trade data for January renewed investor 
concerns about the financing of the U.S. current account deficit and apparently weighed on the dollar.  On a bilateral basis,  the dollar depreciated against most other 
major currencies over the period, includin g a 3 percent decline posted against the 
Canadian dollar and a 2¾ percent drop vis-à-vis the euro.  The dollar rose slightly versus the yen, however, amid signs of cont inued economic sluggishness in Japan.  
Ten-year sovereign yields increased 15 to 20 basis points in most major foreign industrial countries, reflecting in some case s moves up in expected future inflation, 
and major equity indexes registered modest gains.  Both the Reserve Bank of Australia 
and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand raised their main policy rates 25 basis points earlier this month, citing concerns  about inflationary pressures.   
(5) The dollar was about unchanged on net over the intermeeting period against 
the currencies of our other important tradin g partners.  The dollar depreciated more 
than 2½ percent against the Korean won an d by smaller amounts versus several other

 Factors Affecting the Volatili ty of Financial Variables 
 
As noted by the black line in the chart below, re alized volatility for the te n-year Treasury yield has 
fallen over the past year to its lowest point in several years.  In part, FOMC communications may 
have contributed to this decline by providing cl earer guidance to market participants about the 
likely future course of monetary policy.  In addi tion, volatility associated with market reactions to 
macro data releases (the red line) seems to have  moved lower over recent months.  (Treasury 
yield volatility associated with reactions to macr o data releases is measured here as the moving 
six-month standard deviation of changes in the ten-year Treasury yield over narrow time intervals 
bracketing each economic data release.)  Clearl y, many factors other than macro data releases 
influence yields, and the effect of these other fact ors is especially pronounced during periods of 
market turmoil such as the fall of 1998, the afte rmath of the September 11 attacks, and the period 
following major corporate accounting scandals.  Since last June, however, the decline in yield 
volatility seems to be attributable largely to th e decline in the volatilit y associated with market 
reactions to macro data releases.  Following th is decline, the latter measure of volatility has 
remained in the middle of its historical range.   The blue line displays the volatility in yields 
attributable to the predicted  market reactions to macro data re leases based on a simple event study 
regression relating changes in ten-year yields to the unexpected or surprise component of 
economic data releases estimated over the period from  1991 to present.  This volatility series also 
has moved lower over recent months, suggesting that  the drop in ten-year yield volatility has been 
associated both with a decline in  the average magnitude of econom ic data surprises and a more 
muted market response to surprises.

Asian currencies.  In contrast, the dollar appreciated about 4½ percent against the 
Brazilian real, amid reports of official sales of real by the Brazilian central bank.  
During the intermeeting period, Brazil’s ma in equity index was boosted to record 
highs by large capital inflows from foreign private investors.  Although higher dollar 
interest rates raised concerns in Latin Am erican financial markets toward the end of 
the intermeeting period, equity prices in th e region were generally strong, owing in 
part to perceptions of improving econom ic conditions.  Dollar-denominated bond 
spreads narrowed to record low levels earlie r this month, but they widened abruptly in 
the past week.    
(6) Growth in nonfinancial sector debt has remained robust of late.  Domestic 
nonfinancial business sector debt grew at an 8 percent annual rate in the final quarter 
of last year and appears to be rising nearly as fast in the current quarter (Chart 4).  
Business borrowing has likely been boosted by  faster inventory accumulation and a 
pickup in merger and acquisi tion activity.  With the housing market still hot and 
mortgage debt expanding at a double-digit c lip, household debt again grew robustly in 
the final quarter of 2004 and appears to be on track for another sizable increase this quarter.  The growth of federal debt remains brisk. (7) M2 growth slowed to a 2½ percent pace over the first two months of 2005, 
evidently in response to widening opportuni ty costs.  Rates on liquid deposits have 
changed little in the face of rising short- term market rates, while those on small time 
deposits have kept better pace with market yi elds.  As a result, liquid deposit growth 
was anemic in January and February while s mall time deposits grew substantially.  In 
addition, the attractiveness of M2 assets has apparently dimmed relative to capital 
market instruments, as flows into longer-term mu tual funds have increased this year.

Policy Alternatives 
(8) Incoming information over the intermeeting period led  the staff to mark up 
its assessments of the underlying streng th of aggregate demand and the inflation 
outlook as well as its assumption for the path  of the federal funds rate.  The staff has 
read the smaller-than-expected moderation in  spending on capital goods thus far this 
year as implying that the strength in capita l spending over the latter half of 2004 did 
not owe materially to a pulling forward of sp ending to take advantage of the partial-
expensing tax provision that expired at the end of the year.  As a consequence, the 
staff now interprets a larger portion of last year’s pickup in investment as the product 
of factors that are likely to support such sp ending into this year.  The drag associated 
with an upward revision to the projected path  of oil prices in light of the sharp and 
unexpected rise in spot and future oil prices over the intermeeting period only 
partially offsets this additional strength in aggregate demand.  Real GDP is now 
projected to expand 4 and 3½ percent, re spectively, in 2005 and 2006, placing the 
level of output only a touch be low that of its potential at  the end of the forecast.  
Recent readings on inflation, higher prices  for oil and other commodities, and some 
further depreciation in the exchange value of  the dollar induced the staff to raise its 
inflation projection a bit.  Core PCE inflation is now anticipated to tick up this year to 
about 1¾ percent before falling back to ab out 1½ percent in 2006.  Total consumer 
price inflation is projected to slow appreciab ly this year and next as oil prices retrace 
some of their recent gains, non-oil import pri ces decelerate, and productivity growth 
remains solid.  The Greenbook forecast is now conditioned on an assumption that the 
target federal funds rate will reach 3½ percen t by the end of this year and 4 percent by 
the end of 2006—a trajectory that is 50 ba sis points higher than assumed in January 
and only a bit below the market’s anticipate d path for the funds rate.  Longer-term 
yields are expected to change little over th e forecast period:  The effects of rising 
short-term rates are counterbalanced by some marking down of forward rates at 
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 10 of 37
longer horizons as market participants’ poli cy expectations come into better alignment 
with the staff outlook.  Equity prices are proj ected to rise at a pace sufficient to yield 
risk-adjusted returns in line with those on fixed-income securities, and the foreign 
exchange value of the dollar is anticipated to  edge lower over the forecast period.   
(9) This Bluebook presents three alternat ives for the Committee’s consideration 
that are summarized in Table 1, together wi th associated wording.  Under Alternative 
B, the funds rate would be raised 25 basis po ints at this meeting.  The accompanying 
statement would be quite similar to that issued following the February meeting but 
would note that output continues to grow at  a solid pace, that inflation pressures had 
picked up, and that the rise in energy pric es had not notably fed through to wages or 
core consumer prices.  Alternative B makes the balance-of-risks assessment explicitly 
conditional on “appropriate policy” and uses a more forceful verb phrase, “should be 
kept,” to underscore that it may take policy action to preserve balance.3  As explained 
in the box on the next page, several of th e characterizations in that statement may 
now or in the not-too-distant future be se en as needing revision in light of economic 
developments.  As a case in point, the Committee may regard the current measured-
pace language as limiting its flexibility at this and subsequent meetings.  To allow for a 
broader range of policy options, under Al ternatives A and C, the measured-pace 
language is replaced with a sentence emphasizing economic  prospects as the principal 
factor that will determine the pace at which policy accommodation is removed.  The 
statement could point to upside risks to  sustainable growth and price stability 
conditional on an unchanged target federal fu nds rate for the next few quarters as an 
additional way of signaling the likely di rection of the path for policy.  Under 
Alternative A, the funds rate also wo uld be raised 25 basis points, but the 
                                           
3 The Committee has accompanied its six prior ti ghtenings with assessments that the risks to 
both of its goals were balanced, which indicates that those assessments have implicitly been 
conditioned on an appropriate path  of policy.  However, explicit ly stating that conditionality, 
as in Alternative B, will probably limit the usef ulness of this form of the risk assessment in 
signaling the likely direction of future policy moves.

Rationale 
4. Inflation and longer-term inflation 
expectations remain well 
contained. Although month-to-month movements in 
inflation have been volatile of late, 
underlying  inflation and longer-term inflation 
expectations remain  well contained. Inflation and  Longer-term inflation 
expectations remain well contained , though pressures on 
inflation have picked up modestly in recent months.  The 
rise in energy prices, however, 
has not notably fed through to 
wages or core consumer prices.  While I
nflation and  longer-term inflation 
expectations remain well  contained,  pressures 
on inflation have intensified in recent months.  
5. The Committee perceives the upside and downside risks to the 
attainment of both sustainable 
growth and price stability for the 
next few quarters to be roughly 
equal. The Committee perceives the upside and 
downside risks to the attainment of both 
sustainable growth and price stability for the 
next few quarters to be roughly equal that, if 
the current target for the federal funds rate were maintained for the next few quarters, it 
is more likely than not that output would 
grow at a pace faster than is sustainable and 
that inflation pressures would pick up.    The Committee perceives that, 
with appropriate policy action , 
the upside and downside risks to 
the attainment of both sustainable 
growth and price stability for the 
next few quarters  to be  should be 
kept roughly equal. The Committee perceives the upside and 
downside risks to the attainment of both 
sustainable growth and price stability for the 
next few qua rters to be roughly equal  that, if 
the current target for the federal funds rate 
were maintained for the next few quarters, it 
is more likely than not that output would 
grow at a pace faster than is sustainable and 
that inflation pressures would pick up.    Assessment 
of Risk 6. With underlying inflation expected 
to be relatively low, the Committee 
believes that policy 
accommodation can be removed at 
a pace that is likely to be measured. 
Nonetheless, the Committee will 
respond to changes in economic 
prospects as needed to fulfill its 
obligation to maintain price 
stability. With underlying inflation expected to be 
relatively low, the Co mmittee believes that 
policy accommodation can be removed at a 
pace that is likely to be measured.  Nonetheless, 
the Committee will respond to cha nges in 
economic prospects as needed to fulfill its 
obligation to maintain price stability.   However, 
the pace at which policy accommodation 
will be removed to contain those risks will 
depend on economic prospects.  With underlying inflation expected to be relatively low, the Committee 
believes that policy 
accommodation can be removed at 
a pace that is likely to be

 Issues Associated with the 
FOMC Statement Language 
 
The Committee will likely face five key issues concerning its statement language over upcoming 
meetings.  First, as noted in the markup of the February 
FOMC statement at the righ t, the Committee will need 
to determine whether its characterization of the stance of policy—marked in red—should be modified in some 
way.  Second, as noted in bl ue, the FOMC may need to 
revise its assessment of the pace of underlying 
productivity growth in light of the realized and anticipated slowing in actu al productivity growth.  
Third, the assessment of inflation and inflation expectations—noted in green—may need to be 
revisited.  Fourth, as mark ed in purple, the Committee 
may wish to alter the “measured pace” language.  This 
might be the case if the Committee judged that a pause 
in the process of removing policy accommodation might be called for or, alternatively, if it determined that economic circumstances warranted a more rapid 
policy adjustment.  However, eliminating the measured-
pace language without a replacement would leave the risk assessment paragraph without a signal about the future direction of policy.  That omission raises the 
fifth issue—noted in orange —regarding the balance-of-
risks assessment.   February 2005 FOMC Statement 
The Federal Open Market  Committee decided today 
to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis 
points to 2-1/2 percent.  
The Committee believes that, even after this action, 
the stance of monetary policy remains 
accommodative  and, coupled with  robust 
underlying growth in productivity , is providing 
ongoing support to economic activity.  Output appears to be growing at a moderate pace despite the 
rise in energy prices, and labor market conditions continue to improve gradually.  Inflation and 
longer-term inflation ex pectations remain well 
contained .  
The Committee perceives the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability for the 
next few quarters to be roughly equal.  With 
underlying inflation expect ed to be relatively low , 
the Committee believes that policy accommodation  
can be removed at a pace that is likely to be  
measured . Nonetheless, the Committee will respond 
to changes in economic pros pects as needed to fulfill 
its obligation to maintain price stability .  Is productivity 
growth still 
robust? Is policy still 
accommodative? 
Is inflation well-contained and 
expected to be 
relatively low? 
Are the risks still balanced? 
Will the pace of 
firming remain ‘measured’? 
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 13 of 37
accompanying statement would suggest less concern about underlying inflation 
prospects.  Under Alternative C, the funds rate would be boosted 50 basis points, and 
the accompanying statement would give mo re emphasis to the perception of upside 
inflation risks.  These alternatives may cont ain elements of statement language that 
the Committee might find more appealing th an the wording of Alternative B or may 
be helpful in informing potential changes in the policy announcement over the next 
few meetings. 
(10) All three alternatives envisage some pol icy tightening at this meeting, which 
might be seen as necessary to contain the apparent momentum of spending and 
heightened inflation pressures.  During  the discussion in February, members 
universally viewed themselves as likely to  favor firming in March, and the data 
released since then would not seem likely to have discouraged that sentiment.  In that 
regard, investors appear unanimous in their expectation of a quarter-point hike at this 
meeting.  While considerable  uncertainty surrounds estimates of the equilibrium real 
rate, standard models put it well above the current level of the real federal funds rate 
(Chart 5).  Additional tightening would also be called for by a range of standard policy 
prescriptions (Chart 6).   (11) If the Committee found the Greenbook forecast for output and inflation 
conditional on continued gradual remova l of policy accommodation both plausible 
and acceptable, it might choose to raise th e target federal funds rate ¼ percentage 
point at this meeting and issue a statement like that shown for Alternative B  in Table 
1.  The Committee might view this action  as consistent with the measured-pace 
language of the February statement and appropriately validating current market 
expectations of continued gradual firming.   While there are some signs of greater 
pressures on inflation—as evidenced by more rapid growth in producer and 
commodity prices and a possible further increase in near-term inflation expectations—resource slack lingers, labor  costs have only edged up, and firms

Equilibrium Real Rate Chart: Explanatory Notes  
 
The equilibrium real rate is the real  federal funds rate that, if maintained, would be projected to return 
output to its potential level over time.   The short-run equilibrium rate is  defined as the rate that would 
close the output gap in twelve qua rters given a model’s projection of the economy, and the medium-run 
concept is the value of the real f unds rate projected to keep output at potential in se ven years under the 
assumption that monetary policy acts to bring actua l and potential output into line in the short run and 
then keep them equal thereafter.  With the excepti on of the TIPS-consistent measure, the real federal 
funds rates employ the log difference of the core PCE price index over the previous four quarters as a 
proxy for expected inflation, with the staff projection used for the curren t quarter.  TIPS indexation is 
based on the total CPI.  
        
Measure Description 
Single-Equation 
Model   The measure of the equilibrium real rate in the single-equation model is based on an 
estimated aggregate-demand relationship between  the current value of the output gap and 
its lagged values as well as the lagged values of the real federal funds rate.  In light of 
this model’s simple structure, the short-run measure of the equilibrium real rate depends 
only on the recent position of output relative to potential, and the medium-run measure is 
virtually constant.  
Small Structural 
Model  The small-scale model of the economy consists of equations for five variables: the output 
gap, the equity premium, the federal budget surp lus, the trend growth rate of output, and 
the real bond yield.  Unlike the estimates from the single-equation model, values of the 
equilibrium real rate also depend directly  on conditions associated with output growth, 
fiscal policy, and capital markets.  
Large Model 
(FRB/US)  Estimates of the equilibrium real rate using FRB/US—the staff’s large-scale econometric 
model of the U.S. economy—depend on a very broad array of economic factors, some of 
which take the form of projected values of the model’s exogenous variables.  These projections make use of several simple fo recasting rules which are appropriate for the 
three-year horizon relevant for the short-run concept but are less sensible over longer 
horizons.  Thus, we report only the shor t-run measure for the FRB/US model.
 
Greenbook-
consistent  Measures of the equilibrium real rate cannot be directly obtained from the Greenbook 
forecast, because the Greenbook is not based on a formal model.  Rather, we use the 
FRB/US model in conjunction with an extended version of the Greenbook forecast to derive a Greenbook-consistent measure.  FRB/ US is first add-factored so that its 
simulation matches the extended Greenbook forecast, and then a second simulation is run off this baseline to determine the value of the real federal funds rate that closes the output 
gap.  The medium-run concept of the equilibrium real rate is not computed because it requires a relatively long extension of the Greenbook forecast.
 
TIPS-consistent  Yields on TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) incorporate investors’ 
expectations of the future path of real inte rest rates.  The seven-year instantaneous real 
forward rate derived from TIPS yields reflects the short-term real interest rate expected to prevail in seven years as well as any applicable term premium on the Bluebook 
publication date.  The term premium is assumed to be 70 basis points.

probably have scope to absorb some increase  in costs by reducing profit margins.  A 
quarter-point firming at this meeting presu mably to be followed by further increases 
over time could be seen as sufficient to cut off the inflation pressures already in the 
pipeline, especially so if the Committee ha rbors doubts about the continued vigor of 
the expansion given the sharp rise in oil pr ices and the backup in long-term rates.   
(12) According to the Desk’s survey of pr imary dealers and anecdotal reports, 
market participants universally anticipate a quarter-point firming in policy at this 
meeting and generally expect only relatively  minor changes to the statement language.  
As a result, it seems likely that the market reaction to Alternative B would be fairly 
muted.  However, investors would take no te of the reference to the pickup of 
inflation pressures and would conclude that  the Committee believed that “appropriate 
policy” would most likely entail more polic y firming than previously expected.    
Consequently, yields would probably ti ck up a few basis points following the 
announcement while stock prices could fall back a bit. 
(13) The Committee might view recent elevated readings on some price 
measures as providing a stronger signal of  heightened inflation pressures than does 
the staff.  In this case, the Committee may wish to raise the target federal funds rate 
by 50 basis points and issue a st atement like that described for Alternative C .  This 
option might be viewed as particularly appealing if the Committee thought that 
underlying productivity grow th had slowed substantially or that output was already 
approaching, or had even outstripped, potential.  Even if the Committee generally believes that inflation and inflation expectations are likely to remain well-contained under the gradual trajectory of policy tigh tening assumed in the Greenbook, it may 
view the upside risks to that forecast—w hich are explored in the “spending boom 
with rising inflation expectations” s cenario in the Greenbook—as sufficiently 
worrisome to justify a half-point move at this meeting.  In light of the apparent 
momentum of aggregate demand, the Commi ttee may perceive the risk that market 
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 19 of 37
participants come to view it as wavering in its commitment to k eep inflation in check 
as more serious than the risk that mar ket participants begin to build in an 
inappropriately tight path for monetary policy. 
(14) If the Committee instead views recent higher inflation readings as largely 
transitory, it may wish to firm policy by a quarter point at this meeting and issue a 
statement like that described under Alternative A .  With longer-term inflation 
expectations well-contained and resource slac k apparently being worked down slowly, 
the Committee may see relatively  little cost in continuing  along a path of gradual 
removal of policy accommodation.  Indeed , the Committee may want to choose the 
words of its statement so as to keep mar ket participants from marking up their 
expected path of tightening.  This might be  so even if the Committee anticipates that 
resource slack is likely to be e liminated fairly soon, if it also saw downside risks to that 
forecast—such as are discussed in the “higher bond premiums” scenario in the 
Greenbook—as significant given the recent run- up in interest rates and rise in oil 
prices. (15) Under either Alternative A or C,  the Committee may judge that the 
measured-pace language is no long er consistent with the likely  future course of policy.  
Some might view this wording—at least as  it has come to be interpreted in the 
markets after six quarter-point firmings with unchanged language—as ruling out a 
potential pause in policy at upcoming meetin gs.  At the same time, that wording might 
be regarded as potentially constraining on the upside if the Committee saw a 
significant likelihood that it might need to  accelerate the process of removing policy 
accommodation.  Indeed, members might not choose to firm 50 basis points at this 
meeting because of the force of such a c onstraint.  As a result, the Committee might 
wish to strike the measured-pace language from its statement at this meeting.  To 
accomplish this while still providing a general signal about the probable future direction of policy, the Committee could make  its risk assessments conditional on an 
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 20 of 37
unchanged target federal funds rate for the next few quarters.  For Alternatives A and 
C, the Committee could then indi cate that it is “more likel y than not” that the growth 
of output would exceed its sustainable pace and that in flation pressures would pick 
up.  The last sentence of the paragraph could underscore the importance of 
“economic prospects” as a guide for policy makers in judging the pace at which policy 
accommodation should be removed. (16) Although the risk assessment paragraphs in Alternatives A and C are similar, 
the characterizations of the economy and pri ces in the rationale paragraphs are quite 
different.  Under Alternative A, the rati onale paragraph would suggest that the 
Committee sees the stance of monetary policy as “somewhat” accommodative and regards the recent uptick in inflation readings  as transitory, with underlying inflation 
and inflation expectations remaining well-cont ained.  Such sentiments, along with the 
observation that the firming of policy had cumulated to 175 basis points, would seem 
to signal a pause sometime soon.  In cont rast, the language for Alternative C would 
suggest that output growth is proceeding at a pace that seems likely to eliminate 
resource slack in the near term and wo uld note that inflation pressures have 
intensified, signaling a pickup in the pace of  firming.  Such language may be favored 
in order to indicate that the Committee could begin to tighte n more forcefully 
sometime soon even if it moves 25 basis points at this meeting.  
(17) Market participants would be caug ht off guard by the 50 basis point 
tightening of Alternative C.   Moreover , investors could infer from the concerns 
expressed about inflation and the removal of  the measured-pace language that further 
half-point policy tightenings could well be forthcoming.  Interest rates would likely 
rise sharply across the yield curve, while st ock prices would decl ine in response to 
both the rise in rates and an associated marking down of prospects for earnings 
growth.  The rise in longer-term yields woul d be tempered to the extent that investors 
scaled down their longer-term inflation expectations.  The market reaction to the 
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 21 of 37
language of Alternative C would be some what attenuated if the Committee boosted 
rates at this meeting by only a quarter point.  Even in this case, however, the language 
would presumably be read as suggesting  that a more rapid removal of policy 
accommodation was likely in the future—that is, 50 basis point moves could well be 
in the cards.  The market reaction to adopti on of Alternative A is more difficult to 
gauge, but the mention of cumulative fi rming, upbeat assessment of inflation 
prospects, and the characterization of th e stance of policy as only “somewhat” 
accommodative in the rationale paragra ph should tend to put some downward 
pressure on yields.  Some observers might interpret the absence of the measured-pace 
language as an indication of increased odds of a pause at upcoming meetings.  On net, 
interest rates would probably drop and stock prices would likely move up following 
the announcement. 
Money and Debt Forecasts 
(18) Widening opportunity costs and perceptions of favorable returns in bond 
and equity markets are expected to damp money growth this year and next.  With 
short-term money market rates increasing, the composition of M2 is expected to 
continue to shift toward components such as small time deposits that offer more 
competitive yields.  M2 is projected to rise  3 and 4 percent, respectively, in 2005 and 
2006—roughly in line with the historical relationships among money, income, and 
opportunity costs.  Borrowing by domestic nonf inancial corporations is anticipated to 
pick up over the forecast horizon as ri sing capital expenditures and mergers and 
acquisition activity spur fina ncing needs, which increasingly exceed internal funds.  By 
contrast, the pace of borrowing in other sector s, while still brisk, is projected to step 
down from that of last year.  In the house hold sector, consumers are expected to take 
steps to reverse some of the decline in th e saving rate registered in recent years.  
Moreover, mortgage debt is projected to de celerate appreciably in response to higher

Directive and Balance of  Risks Statement 
(19) Draft language for the directive and draf t risk assessments identical to those 
presented in Table 1 are provided below. 
Directive Wording 
The Federal Open Market Committee  seeks  monetary and financial 
conditions that will foster price st ability and promote sustainable growth 
in output.  To further its long-r un objectives, the Committee in the 
immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with 
MAINTAINING/increasing/REDUCING the federal funds rate 
AT/to an average of around ____________ 2 -1/2 percent. 
Risk Assessments  
A. The Committee perceives that, if the current target for the federal funds rate were maintained for the next few quarters, it is more likely than not 
that output would grow at a pace fast er than is sustainable and inflation 
pressures would pick up.  Howe ver, the pace at which policy 
accommodation will be removed to c ontain those risks will depend on 
economic prospects.  
B. The Committee perceives that, with a ppropriate policy action, the upside 
and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and 
price stability should be kept roughl y equal.  With underlying inflation 
expected to be relatively low, the Committee believes that policy 
accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured; nonetheless, the Committee will re spond to changes in economic 
prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability. 
C. The Committee perceives that, if the current target for the federal funds rate were maintained for the next few quarters, it is more likely than not 
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 25 of 37
that output would grow at a pace fast er than is sustainable and inflation 
pressures would pick up.  Howe ver, the pace at which policy 
accommodation will be removed to c ontain those risks will depend on 
economic prospects.

Inflation Indicator Based on M2 and Two
Estimates of V*
Note. P* is defined to equal M2 times V* divided by potential GDP. Long-run velocity (V*) is estimated from
1959:Q1 to 1989:Q4. V* after 1992 is estimated from 1993:Q1 to present. For the forecast period, P* is based
on staff M2 forecast and P is simulated using a short-run dynamic model relating P to P*. Vertical lines
