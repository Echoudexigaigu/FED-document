MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES  
Recent Developments 
(1) The Committee’s decision at its March meeting to increase the target 
federal funds rate 25 basis points to 2¾ percent was widely anticipated by market 
participants, as were the retention of the “measured pace” language and the 
assessment that the risks to sustainable growth and price stability were balanced.1  
However, the references in the statement to increased inflation pressures and to 
more evident pricing power, as well as the explicit conditioning of the balance of 
risks on “appropriate monetary policy action, ” were apparently read by investors as 
indicating that the Committee might tighte n policy more rapidly than previously 
thought.  In consequence, policy exp ectations firmed somewhat after the 
announcement and rose further on the heels of a larger-than-expected increase in 
consumer prices for February released on the next day.   
(2) In the weeks that followed, however, readings on spending, employment, 
and production came in weaker than expect ed, on balance, and equity markets sold 
off significantly.  In addition, the minute s of the March FOMC meeting were viewed 
as suggesting that the Committee perceive d less upside risk to inflation than 
investors had earlier surmised.  Market participants took particular note of the statement in those minutes that members believed that an accelerated path of policy tightening did not appear necessary at the time.  Despite the subsequent publication 
                                                 
1 The effective federal funds rate averaged 2.77 percent over the intermeeting period amid 
pressures from quarter-end flows and the April tax date.  Late in the period, participants again bid 
up the funds rate in anticipation of tightening at this meeting.  The Desk purchased $1.9 billion of 
Treasury coupon securities in the market and re deemed $211 million of two-year notes at an 
auction to comply with its per-issue portfolio gu idelines.  The volume of outstanding long-term 
RPs remained unchanged on balance at $17 billion.  
of higher-than-expected consumer prices  for March, the expected policy path 
rotated down on net over the intermeeting period (Chart 1).  Options on federal 
funds futures indicate that investors are certa in of a 25 basis point tightening at this 
meeting and have considerably scaled back the odds placed on a larger move in June 
(see box).  Current futures prices also in dicate a mean expectation for the federal 
funds rate a bit below 4 percent at the end of 2006, about 30 ba sis points lower than 
 Probability of a Pause or a Half-Point Increase 
Money market futures prices indicate that the federal funds rate is expected to be raised to    
3 percent at this meeting and to reach 3½ percent by the end of this year.  Such a 
configuration is consistent with two more qua rter-point increases in the funds rate target 
after this meeting spread over the five re maining FOMC meetings of the year.  Thus, 
financial markets appear to be betting that th e process of policy firming will be put on pause 
at some point in 2005.    
Given the relatively deep market in options on July federal funds futures, we can infer 
probabilities associated with various policy actions at the June FOMC meeting.  As shown in 
the chart below, which takes a quarter-point tigh tening at the May meeting as a fait accompli, 
the implied probability of a half-point rate hike  at the June meeting has declined over the 
intermeeting period from nearly even odds to below 10 percent.  Much of this drop occurred 
after the February PCE price index release and in  mid-April as equity pri ces turned down.  In 
contrast, the probability of a pause at the June meeting has roughly doubled to about 
25 percent over the same period.

at the time of the last meeting.  Accord ing to a recent survey by the Desk, primary 
dealers do not expect changes to the ba lance-of-risk sentence at this meeting, 
although some predict that the “measu red pace” language will be dropped. 
(3) The downward revision in policy ex pectations showed through to a 
15 basis point decline in two-year nominal  Treasury yields over the intermeeting 
period, while longer-term nominal yields  moved down about 35 basis points.  
Judging from TIPS, a drop in real yields ac counted for about half of the decline in 
longer-term nominal interest rates, implyi ng that inflation compensation fell about 
15 basis points.  Model-based estimates of term premiums have fallen further over 
the intermeeting period, consistent with th e decline in the vola tility of long-term 
Treasury securities inferred from opti ons prices and perhaps indicative of 
heightened safe-haven demands prompted  by the downturn in equity markets. 
(4) Despite generally favorable earnings reports for the first quarter, broad 
equity indexes fell 3 to 5 percent over  the intermeeting period, apparently 
responding to the softer economic outloo k (Chart 2).  In addition, investors’ 
appetite for risk was diminished by down beat news from Ford, General Motors, and 
a few other prominent firms and by additional  reports of accounting irregularities in 
the insurance industry.  A rough meas ure of the equity premium increased 
somewhat over the period, and implied volatilities on equities turned up, albeit from 
very low levels.  Corporat e bond spreads, while still modest compared with recent 
years, climbed over the intermeeting peri od:  Those on investment-grade corporate 
securities widened about 10 to 20 basi s points, and those on speculative-grade 
securities rose about 90 basis points (see bo x).   Meanwhile, most other indicators of 
corporate credit quality have remained strong on balance. Although General Motors’

 Credit Market Conditions 
The softer economic outlook, concerns about the 
prospects of automobile manufacturers, and further reports of accounti ng irregularities in the 
insurance industry apparently made investors charier of risk.  Negative corporate news mostly concerned investment-grade firms, but the associated widening in spreads was larger and more pervasive in the speculative-grade sector.  As shown in the top panel at the right, the cross-sectional distribution of high-yield credit spreads shifted to the right and became more dispersed.  Consistent with a somewhat diminished appetite for risk among investors, a staff estimate of the corporate bond risk premium rose a good bit from the very low levels it had reached in the first part of the year. 
Signs of heightened risk awareness were also 
visible in the credit default swaps (CDS) market.  Indexes of investment-grade and speculative-grade CDS have gained favor as vehicles to trade credit risk.  Trading of tranches of those indexes, which insure against losses within a specific percentile range, has also grown rapidly in recent years.  As was the case with bond and CDS index spreads, tranche spreads, including those on the super-senior slice of the investment-grade index, widened over the intermeeting period (the middle panel).  This particular tranche would absorb losses only if they exceeded 15 percent of the value of the whole index, and its spread can thus be interpreted as a measure of investors’ perception of the likelihood of extreme outcomes. 
Options on CDS indexes also began trading 
recently.  As shown in the bottom panel, the implied volatility computed from those options has climbed substantially since mid-March, indicating a greater sense of uncertainty among investors about movements in credit spreads going forward.   
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 6 of 40
debt remains investment grade, credit default swap (CDS) spreads on the firm’s 
obligations gapped 250 basis points higher over  the period to levels similar to those 
for poor-quality speculative-grad e issuers.  CDS spreads for Ford also rose, but by 
considerably less. 
(5) Over the intermeeting period, the trade-weighted value of the dollar 
increased 2¼ percent on balance against a basket of major foreign currencies  
(Chart 3).  The dollar rose steeply in  late March on the heels of the FOMC 
announcement and indications of less ro bust growth abroad.  Against most 
currencies, however, some of that gain ha s been erased this month, prompted in 
part by disappointing U.S. data and the release of the FOMC minutes.  Even so, the dollar has continued to move higher vers us the Canadian dollar as weaker-than-
expected Canadian output and employment data, political uncertainties, and a decline of oil prices from their recent pe ak weighed on that currency.  Euro-area 
data were also disappointing and suggest ed to market participants a less-robust 
outlook for growth there.  For the period as a whole, the dollar has appreciated 
4 percent versus the Canadian dollar, 2¼ percent versus the euro, and about 
1 percent versus the yen.
2  Ten-year sovereign yields in  most major foreign industrial 
countries declined 15 to 30 basis points, a bit less than comparable U.S. yields.  
Declines in foreign share prices outstr ipped those in the United States amid 
concerns about the strength of the global recovery.  Turmoil in Chinese-Japanese 
political relations likely added to the down ward pressure on Japanese equity prices, 
which fell 6 percent over the intermeeting period, and may have affected share 
prices more broadly in the region.   
(6) The dollar declined slightly on averag e against the currencies of our other 
important trading partners over the inte rmeeting period.  Movements against most 
currencies were modest, with the notable exception of the Brazilian real , against

which the dollar fell almost 7 percent.  Despite signs of slower growth in Brazil, the 
central bank ceased its operations in curre ncy swaps in mid-March, which had been 
viewed as part of an official effort to weaken the real, and raised its main policy rate 
25 basis points in mid-April to counter infl ationary pressure.  Brazilian stocks fell  
10 percent over the intermeeting period, an d stock prices in other Latin American 
countries also registered significant declines.  Spreads on dollar-denominated sovereign bonds widened slightly over th e intermeeting period.  Various comments 
by G-7 officials emphasizin g the need for China to modify its foreign exchange 
regime, as well as signs of growing protect ionist pressures aimed at Chinese exports, 
pushed up the value of the renminbi ve rsus the dollar in non-deliverable forward 
contracts.   
(7) Domestic nonfinancial sector debt appe ars to have grown at a 9½ percent 
rate in the first quarter, boosted in part  by hefty federal borrowing (Chart 4).  
Perhaps in response to rising corporate yi elds, gross bond issu ance by nonfinancial 
corporations has remained subdued of late, especially in the high-yield sector, while 
retirements of outstanding bonds have stayed near last year’s rapid pace.  Meanwhile, commercial paper issuance and business borrowing from banks advanced at a brisk rate over the interm eeting period.  Significant fractions of 
respondents to the latest Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey reported stronger 
demand for commercial and industrial loan s and continued easing of both lending 
standards and terms over the past three months.  The staff estimates that household debt growth slowed somewhat in the first quarter from the robust pace recorded last 
year.  Household credit quality has remained solid, notwithstanding the recent jump 
in personal bankruptcies sparked by the anticipation of bankruptcy reform. 
(8) M2 is estimated to have grown at a 2¾  percent annual rate on average in 
March and April, about the same pace as ea rlier in the year.  M2 growth remains 
below the estimated expansion of nominal income, although not by as much as

money balances.  Even in the first quarter, wh en the velocity of M2 rose at a rate of 
about 2¾ percent, this monetary aggregate expanded somewhat faster than standard 
models would have predicted, perhaps owing to the flattening of the yield curve and 
declines in equity prices.

Policy Alternatives  
(9) Incoming data over the intermeeti ng period led the staff to reduce 
significantly its projection for near-term gr owth of real activity, to nudge up its 
forecast for inflation, and to mark down its assumption for the path of monetary 
policy.  The federal funds ra te is now assumed to reach 3¼ percent by mid-year and 
to rise another 50 basis points by late 2006 , a little less firming than currently built 
into markets and 25 basis points less cumula tive action than assumed in the March 
Greenbook.  In the current forecast, long-t erm nominal interest rates are projected 
to stay near current levels over the proj ection period, despite the assumed monetary 
policy tightening, as investors come to r ecognize that less firming will be necessary 
to contain inflation than they currently ex pect.  Equity prices are expected to 
increase from their recent lower levels at a pace generating risk-adjusted returns in 
line with yields on fixed-income instrume nts, and the nominal trade-weighted index 
of the dollar’s value against major foreign currencies is assumed to fall at an 
annualized rate of 2 percent.  The price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil is 
forecast to be about flat on balance over  the projection period and to finish 2006 
close to $53 per barrel, approximately $3  above the level forecast in the March 
Greenbook.  In these circumstances, real GDP is forecast to grow 3½ percent this 
year and next, a bit above the staff’s estimat e of the expansion of potential output.  
Nonetheless, resource slack persists over the forecast period, with the 
unemployment rate holding at 5¼ percent (a little above the staff’s estimate of the 
natural rate of unemployment), in part as  labor force participation rises in response 
to improving job prospects.  With regard to inflation, the staff has read the sharp 
jump in the core CPI in March in large me asure as the result of factors that are 
expected to have a much smaller effect on PCE prices.  With some economic slack 
remaining, import prices rising  less rapidly, and energy pr ices falling back somewhat 
as margins shrink, core PCE inflation is fo recast to slow a little over the next two

years.  After a bulge in the first half of this  year, overall PCE inflation is forecast to 
drop to a rate of about 1½ percent in the se cond half of 2005 and in 2006, and core 
PCE inflation is forecast to move down to  around 1¾ percent late this year and to 
remain there in 2006.   
(10) This Bluebook presents three policy alternatives for Committee 
consideration that are listed in Table 1.  Under Alternatives A and B, the target 
federal funds rate would be increased 25 basis points at this meeting.  Apart from 
updating the description of recent ec onomic conditions, the statement under 
Alternative B could be quite similar to that issued following the March FOMC 
meeting.  Alternative A would suggest th at a near-term pause in the process of 
tightening could be in the cards.  Under Al ternative C, the federal funds rate would 
be boosted 50 basis points, and the language would be modified substantially.  Some variant of the wording of this alternative might be appealing even if the Committee 
wished to tighten 25 basis points at this meet ing if it also wanted to signal that its 
future actions spanned a wider range of outcomes than currently envisioned by 
market participants.  More generally, the Committee could use constituent elements 
from more than one of these alternativ es in constructing its statement.  
(11) Although recent economic data have poi nted to noticeably less strength in 
spending and output in the first half of 2005 than anticipated at the time of the 
March meeting, the Committee may still be inclined to tighten policy another 25-basis-point notch at this meeting, as in Alternative B .  The Committee might 
share the view of the staff that, even af ter additional policy firming, growth in 
economic activity will exceed, albeit only slig htly, the rate of expansion of potential 
output in coming quarters.  Such an outl ook accords with staff estimates of the 
equilibrium real rate of interest, which re main above the current level of the real

federal funds rate (Chart 5).3  Indeed, some relatively immediate increase in the 
nominal funds rate may be seen as necessa ry to prevent the real funds rate from 
declining as the result of the recent uptick in inflation.  While the absence of much 
further progress in working down resour ce slack in this forecast may not be 
particularly attractive, policymakers might be lieve that the current situation is best 
described as one in which the economy has been hit by an adverse supply shock 
emanating from the ratcheting higher of o il prices.  In such a circumstance, fate 
deals monetary policymakers an unappealing hand, in that pursuing greater resource 
utilization more aggressively could put pr ice stability at risk and ensuring that 
inflation is kept in check could requi re a worsening of resource slack.   
(12) The draft statement associated with Alternative B updates the wording of 
the March release in light of recent information on spending, employment, and 
inflation.  As shown in Table 1, the Committee could indicate that “Recent data 
suggest that the solid pace of spending growth has slowed somewhat, partly in 
response to the earlier increases in en ergy prices.  Labor market conditions, 
however, apparently continue to improve gr adually.”  In view of the elevated CPI 
figures for the past couple of months, and more generally in recognition of 
increased uncertainty about the interpreta tion of recent inflation news, the draft 
wording for Alternative B also suggests that  the Committee omit the view expressed 
in March that “the rise in energy price s, however, has not notably fed through to 
core consumer prices.”  (The Committee’s consideration of such a change, however, 
could depend on the March reading on PCE prices, which will be released on the 
Friday before the meeting.)  If the Committ ee drops that sentence, it might wish to 
reverse the order of the thoughts in the fi rst sentence on inflation that appeared in 
                                                 
3 Starting with this Bluebook, the TIPS-based measure of the equilibrium real interest rate 
incorporates an upward adjustment of 40 basis points to account for the anticipated average 
difference between total CPI inflation (the basis fo r TIPS indexation) and core PCE inflation (the 
basis for computing inflation expectations in the other measures).

Equilibrium Real Rate Chart: Explanatory Notes  
 
The equilibrium real rate is the real  federal funds rate that, if maintained, would be projected to return 
output to its potential level over time.   The short-run equilibrium rate is  defined as the rate that would 
close the output gap in twelve qua rters given a model’s projection of the economy, and the medium-run 
concept is the value of the real f unds rate projected to keep output at potential in se ven years under the 
assumption that monetary policy acts to bring actua l and potential output into line in the short run and 
then keep them equal thereafter.  The real federal funds rate employs the log difference of the core PCE 
price index over the previous four quarters as a proxy for expected in flation, with the staff projection 
used for the current quarter.  Since TIPS indexati on is based on the total CP I, the TIPS-consistent 
measure incorporates an adjustment for the expect ed difference between CPI inflation and core PCE 
inflation. 
        
Measure Description 
Single-Equation 
Model   The measure of the equilibrium real rate in the single-equation model is based on an 
estimated aggregate-demand relationship between  the current value of the output gap and 
its lagged values as well as the lagged values of the real federal funds rate.  In light of 
this model’s simple structure, the short-run measure of the equilibrium real rate depends 
only on the recent position of output relative to potential, and the medium-run measure is 
virtually constant.  
Small Structural 
Model  The small-scale model of the economy consists of equations for five variables: the output 
gap, the equity premium, the federal budget surp lus, the trend growth rate of output, and 
the real bond yield.  Unlike the estimates from the single-equation model, values of the 
equilibrium real rate also depend directly  on conditions associated with output growth, 
fiscal policy, and capital markets.  
Large Model 
(FRB/US)  Estimates of the equilibrium real rate using FRB/US—the staff’s large-scale econometric 
model of the U.S. economy—depend on a very broad array of economic factors, some of 
which take the form of projected values of the model’s exogenous variables.  These 
projections make use of several simple fo recasting rules which are appropriate for the 
three-year horizon relevant for the short-run concept but are less sensible over longer horizons.  Thus, we report only the shor t-run measure for the FRB/US model.
 
Greenbook-
consistent  Measures of the equilibrium real rate cannot be directly obtained from the Greenbook 
forecast, because the Greenbook is not based on a formal model.  Rather, we use the 
FRB/US model in conjunction with an extended version of the Greenbook forecast to derive a Greenbook-consistent measure.  FRB/ US is first add-factored so that its 
simulation matches the extended Greenbook forecast, and then a second simulation is run off this baseline to determine the value of the real federal funds rate that closes the output 
gap.  The medium-run concept of the equilibrium real rate is not computed because it requires a relatively long extension of the Greenbook forecast.
 
TIPS-consistent  Yields on TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) incorporate investors’ 
expectations of the future path of real inte rest rates.  The seven-year instantaneous real 
forward rate derived from TIPS yields as of  the Bluebook publication date reflects the 
short-term real interest rate expected to pr evail in seven years. This forward rate is 
adjusted down for a term premium, assumed to  be 70 basis points, and adjusted up for the 
difference between total CPI inflation and core PCE inflation, projected to be 40 basis 
points in the medium run.

the March announcement to avoid communica ting an excessively pessimistic view 
of inflation prospects.  Apart from such updating, the announcement could be 
similar to the one issued after the March meeting.  In particular, it would seem—
assuming that members share an economic ou tlook broadly in line with that of the 
staff—that the Committee could retain it s assessment of balanced risks to both 
sustainable growth and price stability under the assumption of “appropriate monetary policy action” that it adopted in  March as well as its judgment that 
removal of policy accommodation can proceed at a measured pace.
4   
(13) Investors appear certain that the Committee will boost the target federal 
funds rate 25 basis points at this meeting.  Also, most expect that the FOMC will 
not make major changes to its announcement,  apart from those necessary to align 
the description of economic conditions with  newly available information.  While a 
growing minority of market participants in  recent days have come to expect the 
“measured pace” language to be shed, it is  hard to tell whether they would view such 
an outcome as a signal of a stepped-up pace of firming or of a pause.  Assuming that 
those differing interpretations about offset  each other, there is little reason to 
suspect that the market reaction to th e adoption of Alternative B would be 
significant.   
(14) If the Committee is reasonably sure th at inflation will be well contained 
but is concerned that spending and outp ut growth may have lost significant 
momentum of late and that progress in redu cing resource slack may have stalled, it 
                                                 
4 Members might interpret the adverse news over the intermeeting period as raising the 
probabilities of outsized deviations of spending  growth below that which is sustainable and 
inflation above that consistent with price stability.  Such skewed risks might be expected to remain 
even after policy is set appropriately, implying th at the Committee would view the risks to its two 
objectives individually as unbalanced—and in a manner that has offsetting implications for policy.  
However, much was made in markets of the Com mittee’s explicit conditioning of the risk 
assessment on appropriate policy and the conclusion generally drawn was that it was close to tautological.  While the selection of unbalanced risks is logically possible in the presence of 
significantly skewed probabilities, another change on the heels of the introduction of an explicit reference to appropriate policy would likely bewilder market participants.
 
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 18 of 40
may wish to combine a 25-basis-point fi rming of policy at this meeting with 
statement language that strongly suggests th e possibility of a pause in firming at the 
June meeting, as in Alternative A .  True, the Committee has repeatedly conveyed in 
its minutes that the “measured pace” langua ge is consistent with a pause in the 
process of tightening, and market participants  have priced in high odds of such a 
possibility later this year.  But it cannot be  ruled out that the present configuration 
of market prices is conditione d on the expectation that the statement will be used to 
signal the possibility of a pause in policy tightening.  If so, the Committee might see 
merit in being more explicit.  A more gradual elimination of accommodation might 
be appealing in light of the downward revi sion of nearly ¾ percentage point in the 
short-run measure of the equilibrium real  interest rate consistent with the 
Greenbook forecast (the first line in the ta ble in Chart 5); by that index, the real 
funds rate would be less than ¼ percenta ge point below its estimated equilibrium 
value after implementation of this alternat ive.  In addition, a 3 percent nominal 
federal funds rate would sit high in th e range of policy recommendations from 
simple policy rules provided in Chart 6— and especially so if members viewed 
2 percent inflation in the core PCE index as  an acceptable outcome.  A gloomy view 
of the risks to the outlook for spendi ng would presumably also incline the 
Committee to signal a pause.  For instance,  economic activity co uld be weaker in 
coming quarters than in the staff forecast for the reasons explored in the “sentiment 
slump” and “sentiment slump with financia l spillover” scenarios in the Greenbook.  
As another possibility, members may be of the view that the slowing in spending 
and activity of late owes le ss to elevated energy prices and more to the cumulative 
monetary policy restraint put in place since Ju ne of last year than is implicit in the 
Greenbook. 5   Pausing to assess the effects al ready in the pipeline from cumulative 
                                                 
5 While most longer-term yields remain below th eir levels just before tightening commenced, 
short- and intermediate-term yields are now much higher.  Those latter increases may be crimping 
spending more than the staff has allowed for, ei ther because the economy is  now more sensitive to

policy restraint might therefore be in order, especially in light of the recent behavior 
of the stock market, bond spreads, and the fo reign exchange value of the dollar.    
(15) The statement accompanying selection of Alternative A could employ 
virtually the same text on aggregate spendi ng and labor market conditions suggested 
for Alternative B—but omitting the word  “somewhat”—as follows:  “Recent data 
suggest that the solid pace of spending grow th has slowed, partly in response to the 
earlier increases in energy prices.  Labor market condit ions, however, apparently 
continue to improve gradually.”  Regardin g inflation, the sentence offered under 
Alternative B could be modified under this  alternative by saying, “While pressures 
on inflation have picked up in recent mont hs and pricing power is more evident, 
longer-term inflation expectations remain we ll contained.”  Also, consistent with a 
relatively benign view of inflation, th e penultimate sentence could be changed to 
begin “With underlying inflation expected  to be relatively low…”  The second 
sentence of the announcement could be alte red to indicate that “the stance of 
monetary policy remains somewhat accommodative,” implying that the amount of 
policy accommodation still to be removed had been reduced.  Correspondingly, in 
the second-to-last sentence, the Commi ttee could refer to “remaining policy 
accommodation” instead of just to “polic y accommodation.”  Finally, to reinforce 
that the trajectory for policy could involve a near-term pause, the statement could refer to “appropriate monetary policy” in stead of “appropriate monetary policy 
action” in the assessment of risks. 
(16) Market participants would not likely miss the hints in the announcement 
of Alternative A of a higher likelihood of a pause in June.  Intermediate- and longer-
term interest rates probably would drop a ppreciably, and equity markets would rally.  
The value of the dollar on foreign exchange  markets would decrease along with the 
drop in U.S. yields.  These market moves migh t be more sizable if investors read the

statement as evidence that inflation pressu res could be less intense than previously 
perceived.  In any event, market participants would likely be especially sensitive to 
readings on inflation over the upcoming intermeeting period.   
(17) Should the Committee be particularly concerned that underlying inflation 
pressures may be intensifying, it might be attracted to the 50-basis-point increase in 
the federal funds rate of Alternative C.   Members may be more inclined than the 
staff to assign signal, rather than noise, to  the jump in the March CPI.  Also, prices 
of far-dated crude oil futures contracts have  remained elevated over the period since 
the last Greenbook, which could be seen as implying little likelih ood of a significant 
unwinding of the previous ru n-up in energy costs.  As discussed in an alternative 
scenario in the Greenbook, firms might pass on to their customers more of the 
higher energy costs than in the baseline forecast.  Moreover, actual productivity 
growth appears to have slowed over recent quarters, and Committee members might be concerned that structural labor pr oductivity will decelerate by more than 
incorporated in the staff projection.  Ta ken together, higher energy prices and 
slower underlying productivity growth may be viewed as an especially adverse supply 
shock that lowers output in a manner that should be accepted rather than resisted.  Abstracting from such gloom about aggregat e supply, last summer’s episode, as well 
as broader economic experience, suggests that  “soft patches” crop up from time to 
time and do not necessarily threaten robust expansion of aggregate demand over a longer period.  If the Committee believes that economic growth is likely to remain 
solid, it could move to check elevated in flation pressures by more vigorous policy 
action at this meeting.  The words of Al ternative C (from row 2 down) might have 
an appeal even if the Committee chose to firm 25 basis points at  this meeting.  A 
“C-lite” approach would conv ey a sense that the Committee wished to ensure that 
the market understood that future policy options spanned a wider range than the current statement might appear to some to allow.  As long as references to the 
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 23 of 40
accommodative stance of policy remain elsewhere in the statement, market 
participants would interpret that flexibility as introducing a tilt toward a firmer, 
rather than an easier, funds rate.  Re moving all forward-looking guidance would 
require excising characterizations of th e degree of accommodation as well as the 
“measured pace” language. (18) As indicated in Table 1, the Commi ttee could consider a number of 
alterations to its statement in associati on with the selection of Alternative C to 
convey a heightened concern about infl ation prospects.  For example, the 
Committee could strike the reference to “robu st underlying growth in productivity” 
in the second sentence.  In addition, it  could choose not to focus on the apparent 
recent slowing in output growth and simply note that “output continues to grow at a 
pace sufficient to eliminate any remaining re source slack.”  With regard to inflation, 
the Committee would probably wish to de lete the sentence in the previous 
announcement that “The rise in energy pr ices, however, has not notably fed through 
to core consumer prices.”  Given the conditioning assumption of “appropriate 
monetary policy,” the Committee could reta in its assessment that the risks to 
attainment of sustainable growth and pri ce stability are balanced.  However, if the 
Committee wanted to gain flexibility to tighte n policy at a faster pace in the future, it 
presumably would delete the risk assessmen t and the sentence expressing its belief 
that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured.  
(The characterization that policy is a ccommodative elsewhere in the statement 
would remain as the sole signal of the dire ction of future action.)  Even after these 
deletions, the Committee might wish to unde rscore that its future actions would 
depend on evolving economic outcomes by  indicating, with a nod to its dual 
objectives, that “The Committee will respon d to changes in economic prospects as 
needed to fulfill its obligation to foster the attainment of both sustainable economic growth and price stability.” 
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 24 of 40
(19) The selection of the 50-basis-point in crease in the federal funds rate of 
Alternative C would come as a considerable  surprise to market participants.  That 
hike, coupled with some or all of the changes in announcement wording discussed 
in the previous paragraph, would prompt investors to revise sharply upward their 
expectations for the path of monetary poli cy in the near term and likely beyond, and 
thus would have a pronounced effect on fina ncial markets more generally.  Interest 
rates would rise substantially across the yi eld curve, equity prices would probably 
decline, and the foreign exchange value of the dollar could increase significantly.  
The same language associated with a quarter -point increase in the funds rate would 
also send markets in the same di rection, but to a lesser extent. 
Money and Debt Forecasts 
(20) Under the Greenbook forecast, rising short-term interest rates are 
expected to be accompanied by increasing opportunity costs of holding monetary 
assets as deposit interest rates, particularly those on liquid deposits, lag increases in 
market yields.  As a result, growth of M2 is  projected to remain weak, averaging just 
2¾ percent for 2005 as a whole and 4 perc ent in 2006.  Over the forecast period, 
the debt of nonfinancial corporations is projected to expand at a moderate rate.  
External financing needs are expected to be  held down this year by inflows from 
abroad in response to temporary favorable tax treatment of repatriated earnings and 
high levels of liquid assets.  In 2006, non financial corporations are expected to tap 
credit markets to a somewhat greater extent, and net equity runoffs are projected to diminish.  Household sector borrowing is  anticipated to decelerate in coming 
quarters as house price increases slow an d households begin to reverse the sharp 
decline in the saving rate that has occurred in recent years.  In 2005 and 2006, 
federal debt is expected to grow at a pace a little below the 9 percent rate of increase

Directive and Balance of  Risks Statement 
(21) Draft language for the directive and draft risk assessments identical to 
those presented in Table 1 are provided below. 
Directive Wording 
The Federal Open Market Committee  seeks  monetary and financial 
conditions that will foster price st ability and promote sustainable growth 
in output.  To further its long-r un objectives, the Committee in the 
immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with 
MAINTAINING/increasing/REDUCING the federal funds rate 
AT/to an average of around ____________ 2 -3/4 percent. 
Risk Assessments  
A. The Committee perceives that, with appropriate monetary policy, the upside and downside risks to the a ttainment of both sustainable growth 
and price stability should be kept roughly equal.  With underlying 
inflation expected to be relative ly low, the Committee believes that 
remaining policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely 
to be measured.  Nonetheless, the Committee will respond to changes in 
economic prospects as needed to fulf ill its obligation to maintain price 
stability. 
B. The Committee perceives that, with appropriate monetary policy action, 
the upside and downside risks to th e attainment of both sustainable 
growth and price stability should be kept roughly equal.  With underlying 
inflation expected to be contained, the Committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured.  
Nonetheless, the Committee will respond to changes in economic 
prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability.
