MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES  
Recent Developments 
(1) The Committee’s decision at the August  meeting to tighten policy a quarter 
point, to maintain an assessment that the risks to both price stability and sustainable growth were balanced, and to retain th e “measured pace” language evoked little 
market reaction.
1  Over the subsequent few weeks, expectations for the path of the 
nominal federal funds rate edged lower in response to rising energy prices and economic data releases suggesting somewh at softer spending and more subdued 
inflation.  As the extent of Hurricane Ka trina’s devastation became apparent, energy 
prices spiked higher and investors marked do wn their outlook for policy further.  The 
revision to the outlook was reinforced by the mention in the minutes of the August 
FOMC meeting of risks to cons umer spending posed by elevated energy prices and by 
economic data releases indicating that eco nomic growth may have been slowing even 
before the hurricane.  In recent days, howev er, interest rate futures have retraced 
some of those declines, influenced by a drop in energy prices as well as comments by 
several FOMC participants that noted unde rlying strength in spending and some 
concerns about inflation.  On net over th e intermeeting period, the federal funds rate 
expected for the middle of next year shifte d down 30 basis points, to about 4 percent, 
while measures of uncertainty about this pa th for policy derived from options prices 
rose notably (Chart 1).  Futures quotes suggest about a one-in-five chance that the 
FOMC will leave policy unchanged on Tuesday,  the first time in more than two years 
that the policy outcome has appeared this uncertain this close to the date of the 
                                          
 
1 Over the intermeeting period, the effective fede ral funds rate was close to the target.  The 
Desk purchased $6.4 billion of Treasury coupon securities and $2.5 billion of Treasury bills 
in the market.  There was also  a redemption of $757 million of  Treasury coupon securities.  
The volume of outstanding long-term RPs decreased $1 billion,  to $18 billion.

meeting.  Respondents to the Desk’s latest de aler survey attach slightly higher odds to 
a pause at this meeting, and only a few expe ct any change to the characterization of 
policy as accommodative or to the “measured pace” language.   
(2) Yields on nominal Treasury notes shed about 20 to 30 basis points over the 
intermeeting period.2  The decline in longer-term yields was accounted for by a 
reduction in forward rates across the term  structure in the pre-Katrina period—
consistent with a revisi on to the longer-term outlook—and a further drop post-
Katrina in near-term forward rates—suggestive  of a larger downward revision to the 
economic outlook in the nearer term.  On  net, the price of crude oil was about 
unchanged over the intermeeting period, but wholesale gasoline prices edged up, and 
natural gas prices jumped (Chart 2). 3  TIPS-implied inflation compensation for the 
next five years increased about 15 basis po ints over the intermeeting period, while 
inflation compensation in the five-to-ten-year  range changed little.  Survey measures 
of inflation expectations held steady, alt hough those surveys were mostly conducted 
before the hurricane.   (3) Yields on investment-grade corporate bonds moved down about in line 
with those on Treasuries, leaving their risk spreads about flat.  Spreads on speculative-
grade debt widened somewhat, but generall y remained narrow.  Major equity indexes 
were little changed over the intermeeting pe riod, and the implied volatility of stock 
prices remained low, as equity market participants apparently assessed the likely 
aggregate economic impact of Hurricane Katrina as being fairly moderate and 
                                          
 
2 Concerns about trading in the August 2012 no te related to the current ten-year Treasury 
note futures contract prompted the Treasury to require a position report from large holders.  
More details on the situation are provided in the box on the next page. 
3 However, spot oil prices ha d risen $3 per barrel between th e publication of the August 
Greenbook and the August FOMC meeting.  As a re sult, oil prices are considerably higher in 
the current staff forecast than th ey were in the August forecast.

 Developments in the Ten-Year  Treasury Futures Market 
The Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) lists ten- year Treasury futures contracts for delivery in 
March, June, September and December of each year.  Trading in these contracts is very active, 
and they have come to serve an important role in hedging interest-rate risk.  Each contract requires the party on the short side to deliver any Treasury security with a remaining maturity 
between six-and-a-half and ten years to the party on the long side.  The invoice price that the 
party on the long side pays for the security is th e accrued interest plus the futures price multiplied 
by a conversion factor that adjusts for the different coupons and maturities of the securities in the deliverable basket.  By design, the conversion factor that CBOT uses works well when market yields are around 6 percent.  However, with yields now well below that level, some 
securities are much cheaper to deliver than others. 
Historically, the vast majority of investors in this market have closed out their positions or 
rolled into the next contract rather than actually taking delivery.  However, as shown in the 
bottom left panel, in the past few contract cycles  open interest has remained relatively elevated 
in the final days of trading and a larger-than- usual number of contracts have gone through the 
delivery process, resulting in strained trading c onditions for the cheapest-to-deliver securities.  
This pattern appears to be occurring again for the September 2005 contract, for which open interest currently stands at a record high for th is stage in the contract cycle.  The cheapest-to-
deliver issue, which is the August 2012 note, has been trading at a substantial premium to comparable-maturity securities in the cash mark et, its repo rate has been close to zero, and the 
level of failures to deliver for this issue has been elevated. Concerns about trading in this note have led the Treasury to require a position re port of large holders. As shown in the bottom 
right panel, the System Open Market Account has in recent days lent out a large fraction of its 
holdings of the August 2012 note in its securi ties lending program (new awards on any one day 
are capped at 65 percent of holdings) . Some in vestors complain that the parties on the long 
side of the futures contract are attempting to generate a short squeeze.  CBOT announced in 
June that it will limit investor s' position sizes near expiration to $5 billion starting with the 
December 2005 contract.

temporary, and offset by lower interest ra tes and higher anticipated federal spending.4  
The stocks of oil companies and utilities registered substantial gains, while a broad 
index of property and casualty insurers wa s down only about 2 percent, although the 
shares of Allstate insurance company, wh ich has a significant exposure in the Gulf 
Coast area, declined 7 percent.  The a nnouncement that two more large U.S. air 
carriers entered into bankruptcy yesterday wa s widely expected and caused barely a 
ripple in financial markets.   
(4) The trade-weighted foreign exchange  value of the dollar against major 
foreign currencies fell about ¾ percent on balance over the intermeeting period 
(Chart 3).5  The dollar was pressured lower duri ng the period by data indicating 
somewhat  weaker U.S. economic performance and, for a while, by concerns about the consequences of Hurricane Katrina.  The dollar moved up about 1 percent against 
the euro, as economic performance in the euro  area continued to be sluggish, but it 
slipped almost 1½ percent versus the yen and 2¼ percent vis-à-vis the Canadian 
dollar.  The Bank of Canada raised its poli cy rate 25 basis points—the first such move 
in almost a year.  Yields on benchmark lo ng-term government securities in most 
foreign industrial countries dropped 15 to  25 basis points over the intermeeting 
period, while yields in Japan edged down on ly a small amount.  Stock prices in most 
countries were about unchanged or up slig htly on balance, but share prices rose 
10 percent in Japan, reacting in part to st rong second-quarter earnings reports from 
Japanese banks and also to the support for the governing coalition shown in national 
elections earlier this week.
  
                                           
4 Timing conventions matter here as well.  Stoc k prices were off modestly from the August 
Greenbook publication date to the September Greenbook publication date but up a touch 
from the meeting date.  The former comparison is relevant for the discussion of revisions to 
the forecast in the “Economic Outlook” section of the Bluebook, while the latter is the basis 
for this section’s discussion of recent developments.

(5) Over the intermeeting period, the dollar recorded a modest gain against an 
index of currencies of our other important tr ading partners that included an increase 
of 1½ percent versus the Mexican peso; the dollar was about unchanged versus the 
Brazilian real.  Responding to weaker activity an d better inflation news, the Bank of 
Mexico eased its overnight lending rate 25 basis points; the central bank of Brazil also 
cut its target rate 25 basis points.  Th e dollar appreciated against several Asian 
currencies on worries about the effects of higher oil prices on economies in that 
region.  The dollar depreciated about ¼ percent on balance over the intermeeting 
period against the Chinese renminbi, though that currency continued to trade against the dollar in a very tight range from day to day. (6) Domestic nonfinancial debt appears to be on track for a fairly solid advance 
in the third quarter (Chart 4).  With mortgage rates still low and house-price 
appreciation apparently remaining robust, ho usehold debt seems likely to register 
another substantial gain this quarter.  Nonf inancial business debt has been expanding 
at a moderate pace.  Spreads on bank business loans remain fairly narrow, although 
those on loans to lower-quality customers a ppear to have widened a bit from their 
narrow levels in the spring.  Business cred it quality remains strong:  Delinquency and 
charge-off rates on business loans at banks ed ged down to near record lows in the 
second quarter, and defaults on corporate bonds were negligible in recent months although they ticked up in early September.   
(7) M2 accelerated to a 5 percent annual ra te in August, owing in part to a 
resumption of growth in liquid deposit s.  In recent weeks, M2 has continued to 
expand, on average, at a faster pace than  would have been predicted based on its 
historical relationship with opportunity costs and nominal income, perhaps because returns on longer-term assets have not been especially attractive.  Cash shipments to 
depository institutions located in the re gion affected by Hurricane Katrina have

reserves and monetary aggregates. 
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 10 of 38
  The Effects of Hurricane Katrina on Reserves and Monetary Aggregates 
 
As yet, there have been few discernible im prints of Hurricane Katrina on aggregate 
monetary and banking statistics.  Currency sh ipments in the six Federal Reserve offices 
serving the affected area are up about $3 billion  relative to those in 2002 and 2003, years that 
were not greatly affected by hurricanes (chart).   But this represents only about 1 percent of 
estimated domestic currency holdings.     
 
While many of the affected depository instituti ons – especially banks and thrifts insured by 
the FDIC – have discount window borrowing do cuments in place, and some of them have 
collateral as well (table), there have been no requests for discount window advances by 
depositories in the region since Katrina’s landfa ll and only a few instan ces of small overnight 
overdrafts.  Liquidity needs apparently have not  picked up given the severe dislocation of 
activity.  Such needs may incr ease as the clean-up continues,  and the discount window and 
other sources of liquidity—including bankers’ banks, corporate central credit unions, and the 
Federal Home Loan Bank System—will be available to meet them.  According to the latest data, deposits in the ar ea most affected by the storm account for only 
about 1¼ percent of the national total.  Some of  those deposits are held at institutions that 
are diversified regionally or nationally, but two- thirds of deposits in the affected area are 
held at institutions that have more than half of their deposits booked at offices in the region.  
A significant majority of the assets of thes e institutions are loans to households and 
businesses (presumably heavily weighted toward the local area) and municipal obligations, 
suggesting that the value of collateral these inst itutions would pledge should they decide to 
tap the discount window may be quite uncertain.  The weekly deposit data (which are partly estimated for the area) do not yet suggest 
significant deposit inflows or outflows.  Pres umably, as the clean-up and rebuilding of the 
region accelerates, fueled importantly by fede ral transfers and insurance payments, more 
noticeable deposit flows will emerge.

Economic Outlook 
(8) The staff has appreciably revised its economic projection, mainly to 
incorporate the effects of Hurricane Katrina.   The disruption to economic activity is 
expected to hold down output and employme nt for several months before giving way 
to recovery and reconstruction, aided by a la rge injection of federal spending.  By the 
end of 2007, economic activity is seen as essentially back on the path in the August 
forecast, with output close to its potential.  As in August, the staff has assumed that 
the stance of monetary policy is tightened gr adually over the next several quarters; the 
federal funds rate reaches 4¼ percent by th e middle of next year, a bit higher than 
currently embedded in financial market prices.  Bond yields are expected to drift up 
over the forecast period, as market partic ipants come to appreciate that monetary 
policy will firm slightly more than currently anticipated.  Equity prices rise at a pace 
sufficient to produce risk-adjusted retu rns in line with those on fixed-income 
securities, and the foreign exchange value of  the dollar is assumed to edge down.  As 
suggested by futures markets, the price of crude oil is forecast to follow a path 
somewhat above that in the last projection, with spot prices rising slightly over the 
next few months before declinin g gradually thereafter.  Retail energy prices in the near 
term are expected to rise more substantiall y than predicted in August, owing partly to 
disruptions to energy production and dist ribution that resulted from the hurricane, 
but then to fall more steeply as the industry ’s infrastructure is rebuilt.  The near-term 
projection for overall inflation has been revise d up sharply, mainly reflecting the direct 
effects of higher consumer energy prices.  As energy prices recede, however, overall 
PCE inflation is forecast to drop a littl e below 2 percent in 2006 and 2007.  The 
projection for core inflation this year has b een shaved a bit, but with the pass-through 
of increased energy prices it has been  boosted to 2¼ percent for 2006, up about 
¼ percentage point from the August round.  Core inflation edges down to 2 percent 
the following year. 
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 12 of 38
Policy Alternatives 
(9) This Bluebook presents two formal policy alternatives for the Committee’s 
consideration, summarized by the draft statements in Table 1.  Both draft 
announcements refer to the adverse near-term effects on spending, production, and 
employment of Hurricane Katrina.  (The box entitled “Monetary Policy 
Announcements and External Events” summarizes the Committee’s past practice with respect to mentioning significant ex ogenous events in its statements.)  The 
announcements also refer to inflation pressu res but indicate that core inflation has 
been relatively low.  Under Alternative A,  the Committee would leave its target for the 
federal funds rate unchanged at 3½ percen t at this meeting; the statement would 
emphasize hurricane-related uncertainties and suggest that this was just a pause in the 
tightening process.  Under Alternative B, the Committee would boost the target 
25 basis points to 3¾ percent; the stat ement would note that the longer-term 
macroeconomic effects of the hurricane are lik ely to be limited.  Because uncertainty 
surrounding the economic outlook has ri sen considerably, this Bluebook also 
considers ways of shading th e language under Alternatives  A and B to project more 
distinct paths for policy.  Paragraph 13 co nsiders changes to the statement language 
(relative to Alternative B) that could ex press more concern about inflation.  In 
contrast, paragraph 16 suggests wording ch anges to Alternative A that would be 
consistent with an expectation of a more pr olonged pause in firming.  Lastly, the box 
at the end of this section entitled “Openi ng Up the Statement” examines fundamental 
changes to the risk assessment that could be made to either Alternative A or B. 
(10) If the Committee remains particularly concerned about heightened inflation 
pressures and sees little chance that Hurrica ne Katrina will have lasting and sizable 
adverse effects on aggregate spending and pr oduction, it may wish to tighten policy  
25 basis points at this meeting, as under Alternative B .  The Committee may view the 
downward revision to monetary policy expe ctations and the associated easing of

Policy 
Decision 1.  The Federal Open Market 
Committee decided today to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 3½ percent. The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to raise
 
leave its target for the federal 
funds rate by 25 basis points to 3½ 
percent  unchanged . The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 3¾ percent. 
2.  The Committee believes that, even after this action, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative and, coupled with robust underlying growth in productivity, is providing ongoing support to economic activity. The Committee deferred further policy firming in light of the uncertainties surrounding the economic effects of Hurricane Katrina.    
[none/see below] 
3.  Aggregate spending, despite high energy prices, appears to have strengthened since late winter, and labor market conditions continue to improve gradually. Output appeared poised to continue growing at a good pace before the tragic toll of the hurricane.  The widespread devastation in the Gulf region, the associated dislocation of economic 
activity, and the boost to energy 
prices imply that spending, production, and employment will be set back in the near term.  Moreover, the disruption to the production and refining infrastructure has elevated premiums for energy products and 
may add to market volatility.  Output appeared po ised to continue 
growing at a good pace  before the tragic 
toll of Hurricane Katrina.  The 
widespread devastation in the Gulf region, the associat ed dislocation of 
economic activity, and the boost to energy prices imply that spending, production, and empl oyment will be set 
back in the near term.  Moreover, the disruption to the prod uction and refining 
infrastructure has elevated premiums for energy products and may add to market volatility. 
While these unfortunate developments 
have increased uncertainty about near-term economic performance, it is the Committee’s view that they do not pose a more persistent threat.  Rather, remaining monetary policy accommodation, coupled with robust underl ying growth in 
productivity, is providing ongoing 
support to econom ic activity.
  
 
   
 
   
 
   
 
  
Rationale  
4.  Core inflation has been 
relatively low in recent months and 
longer-term inflation expectations remain well contained, but pressures on inflation have stayed elevated. Higher energy and other costs have 
the potential to add to inflation 
pressures.  However, core inflation has been relatively low in recent months and longer-term inflation expectations remain well contained.   Higher energy and other costs have

7 Starting with this Bluebook, the TIPS-based measure of the equilibrium real rate 
incorporates time-varying estimates of a te rm premium that compensates investors for 
uncertainty about real rates and of a liquidity  premium that compensates investors for the 
relatively poor liquidity of TIPS.  Both esti mates are obtained from a three-factor arbitrage-
free term-structure model. Monetary Policy Announcemen ts and External Events 
 
There is precedent for the Committee to allude to significant external events in 
its monetary policy announcement.  Fo r example, in December 1999, the Federal 
Reserve announced that “in light of mar ket uncertainties associated with the 
century date change, the Committee decided to adopt a symmetric directive in 
order to indicate that the focus of pol icy in the intermeeting period must be 
ensuring a smooth transition into the Ye ar 2000.”  On September 17, 2001, the 
Committee cited the “tragic events” of th e previous week.  And in January, 
March, and May 2003, the monetary polic y statements referred variously to “oil 
price premiums,” “geopolitical uncertainti es,” and the “hostilities” in Iraq.  
Indeed, in its announcement that Marc h, the Committee temporarily suspended 
its practice of specifying the balance of ri sks to its dual objectives in light of the 
elevated uncertainty surroundi ng the situation in Iraq. 
 
The announcements proposed for Alternativ es A and B are consistent with this 
pattern, citing “the tragic toll” of Hurrica ne Katrina.  They also acknowledge that 
data on spending, production, and employment will deteriorate as the hurricane’s effects show through in coming months.

Equilibrium Real Rate Chart: Explanatory Notes  
 
The equilibrium real rate is the real  federal funds rate that, if maintained, would be projected to return 
output to its potential level over time.  For the first three measures listed below, the short-run 
equilibrium rate is defined as th e rate that would close the output  gap in twelve quarters given the 
corresponding model’s projection of the economy.  For the first two measures, the medium-run concept 
is the value of the real funds rate projected to  keep output at potential  in seven years under the 
assumption that monetary policy acts to bring actua l and potential output into line in the short run and 
then keep them equal thereafter.  The TIPS-based f actor model measure provides an estimate of market 
expectations for the real federal f unds rate seven years ahead.  The act ual real federal funds rate shown 
in the chart employs the log difference of the core PCE price index over the prev ious four quarters as a 
proxy for expected inflation, with the staff projection used for the current quarter. 
   
Measure Description 
Single-Equation 
Model   The measure of the equilibrium real rate in the single-equation model is based on an 
estimated aggregate-demand relationship between  the current value of the output gap and 
its lagged values as well as the lagged values of the real federal funds rate.  In light of this 
model’s simple structure, the short-run measure of the equilibrium real rate depends only 
on the recent position of output relative to potential, and the medium-run measure is virtually constant.
 
Small Structural 
Model  The small-scale model of the economy consists of equations for five variables: the output 
gap, the equity premium, the federal budget surp lus, the trend growth rate of output, and 
the real bond yield.  Unlike the estimates from the single-equation model, values of the equilibrium real rate also depend directly  on conditions associated with output growth, 
fiscal policy, and capital markets.
 
Large Model 
(FRB/US)  Estimates of the equilibrium real rate using FRB/US—the staff’s large-scale econometric 
model of the U.S. economy—depend on a very broad array of economic factors, some of 
which take the form of projected values of the model’s exogenous variables.  These projections make use of several simple fo recasting rules which are appropriate for the 
three-year horizon relevant for the short-run concept but are less sensible over longer horizons.  Thus, we report only the shor t-run measure for the FRB/US model.
 
Greenbook-
consistent  Measures of the equilibrium real rate cannot be directly obtained from the Greenbook 
forecast, because the Greenbook is not based on a formal model.  Rather, we use the 
FRB/US model in conjunction with an extended version of the Greenbook forecast to derive a Greenbook-consistent measure.  FRB/ US is first add-factored so that its 
simulation matches the extended Greenbook forecast, and then a second simulation is run 
off this baseline to determine the value of the real federal funds rate that closes the output 
gap.  The medium-run concept of the equilibrium real rate is not computed because it 
requires a relatively long extension of the Greenbook forecast.
 
TIPS-based 
Factor Model Yields on TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) reflect investors’ expectations of 
the future path of real interest rates, but also include term and liquidity premiums.  The 
TIPS-based measure of the equilibrium real ra te is constructed using the seven-year-ahead 
instantaneous real forward rate derived fro m TIPS yields as of the Bluebook publication 
date.  This forward rate is adjusted to remove estimates of the term and liquidity 
premiums based on a three-factor arbitrage -free term-structure model applied to TIPS 
yields, nominal yields, and inflation.  Because TIPS indexation is based on the total CPI, 
this measure is also adjusted for the me dium-term difference—projected at 40 basis 
points—between total CPI inflation and core PCE inflation.  
 
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 17 of 38
especially those based on an inflation target  of 1½ percent, also point to a further 
near-term increase in the federal funds rate  and suggest more tightening in coming 
quarters (Chart 6).  The Committee’s unce rtainty about prospects for the economy 
and inflation may well have increased in th e aftermath of the hurricane, but probably 
a few months will elapse before a reasona bly clear picture of its economic effects 
emerges.  Thus, unless the Co mmittee sees the hurricane as likely to undermine 
spending significantly for several quarters or  more—the period in which a change in 
monetary policy would have most of its ef fect on spending—or has serious concerns 
that a rate hike might interact in a part icularly unfavorable way with household and 
business confidence, members might believe it prudent to continue to firm policy at 
this meeting. 
(11) As shown in Table 1, the proposed announcement associated with 
Alternative B would indicate that “Output appeared poised to continue growing at a 
good pace before the tragic to ll of Hurricane Katrina.”  It would go on to state that, 
while the hurricane will have adverse s hort-run economic consequences, including 
heightened uncertainty and market volatility, the longer-run prospects for the 
economy are not diminished.  The statemen t would note that “Higher energy and 
other costs have the potential to add to in flation pressures,” but would also indicate 
that “. . . core inflation has been relati vely low in recent months and longer-term 
inflation expectations remain well containe d.”  It would assert that “remaining 
monetary policy accommodation” and robust  underlying growth in productivity 
continued to support economic activity.  The rest of the statement would repeat the 
measured pace language and the assessment that, with appropriate monetary policy 
action, the risks to growth and price stability should be kept roughly equal. (12) Investors currently see a modest probability that the FOMC will leave the 
stance of monetary policy unchanged at this  meeting.  Accordingly, a quarter-point 
increase in the funds rate would tend to boost very short-term market interest rates a

bit, and the retention of the “measured pa ce” language would suggest that further 
policy tightening was likely, probably brin ging the funds rate beyond the 4 percent 
apex currently anticipated in markets.  Consequently, other market interest rates 
would likely increase somewhat in response to the announcement.  The foreign 
exchange value of the dollar could strengthen  a touch, and equity prices could decline 
a bit, although the suggestion that th e FOMC was confident that the economic 
expansion would not be severe ly affected by the hurricane could serve to limit the 
decline in stock prices. (13) At the August meeting, several partic ipants noted that core PCE inflation 
was running at the upper end of the range th ey considered to be consistent with price 
stability.  Since then, the staff has marked up its forecast of core inflation for next year 
about ¼ percentage point, to 2¼ percent.  Moreover, the edging lower of inflation 
thereafter in the projection owes importantly  to the assumed gradual decline in energy 
prices.  If the Committee saw this inflation outcome as unacceptable or believed that 
such an expectation was likely to prove op timistic, then it might view the words of 
Alternative B as too timid about the prospect s for additional policy tightening.  Such a 
concern might well be intensified if signif icant odds were put on the possibility that 
inflation expectations could become unanchor ed in response to surging energy prices, 
perhaps in the manner discussed in the alte rnative simulation in the Greenbook.  The 
likelihood of more tightening than currently built into financial market prices could be 
conveyed to the public by shortening the wording for Alternative B that appears in 
Table 1.  In particular, the Committee could give less weight to the disruptions from 
Hurricane Katrina by striking the second and third sentences and dropping the word 
“remaining” in row 3.
8 
(14) The Committee, in contrast, could arrive  at a decision to keep the federal 
funds rate unchanged for several reasons.  One possibility is that, while generally 
                                           
8 Minor corresponding changes to the fourth sentence of row 3 would also be required. 
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 21 of 38
accepting the economic outlook discussed un der Alternative B, members may harbor 
the reservation that there is a small probabili ty that the disruption to economic activity 
in the Gulf region and sapping of cons umer and business confidence nationwide 
could have serious consequences for th e broader economy.  While the mean (or 
modal) outlook might be taken as a reason to tighten, consideration of that adverse 
tail may counsel delaying further firming for a time.  Under Alternative A , the 
Committee would keep the target federal fund s rate unchanged at 3½ percent at this 
meeting and use the statement to explain that  it was merely deferring firming in light 
of the elevated uncertainties, and likely not ending the tighte ning cycle.  As in 
Alternative B, the Committee could note the adverse near-term effects of the hurricane on spending, production, and em ployment, but not include the sentence 
suggesting that the effects will be temporar y.  The text on inflation in Alternative B 
could also be used in Alternative A.   (15) Short-term market interest rates woul d likely decline noticeably following 
announcement of this alternative.  Howe ver, with the statement suggesting that 
further tightening was still in the cards, the drop in intermediate- and longer-term 
rates probably would be considerably smalle r.  Equity prices could move slightly 
higher, while the value of the dollar on fore ign exchange markets could decline a bit. 
(16) Another possible reason for holding th e funds rate unchanged is that a 
longer pause in policy firming could be  appropriate.  Committee members may be 
concerned that the widespread and se vere damage to private property and 
infrastructure in the Gulf region, the exte nded displacement of a large population, the 
sharp increase in consumer energy prices, and a potential significant drop in consumer 
confidence could well exert a more substa ntial drag on aggregate economic activity 
than in the staff forecast.  Such a possibility is illustrated in the Greenbook’s “sentiment slump” scenario and the scenar io based on a pessimistic view of the 
effects of Katrina.  Moreover, while the stance of policy may still be accommodative, 
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Page 22 of 38
the extent of that accommodation has been  reduced significantly by the Committee’s 
actions through August.  Thus, the Committ ee may feel comfortable awaiting further Opening Up the Statement 
 
The “measured pace” language, which has been included in the 
Committee’s statements for the past eleven  meetings, has served to signal to 
market participants that the federal funds ra te will be marched up steadily as long 
as policy accommodation remains in place.  The Committee may believe that this 
language has now outlived its usefulness for several re asons, independent of this 
meeting’s outcome on the stance of po licy.  First, the 2½-percentage-point 
increase in the nominal federal funds rate since mid-2004 has placed the real 
federal funds rate near some model-base d estimates of its equilibrium (as shown 
in Chart 5).  By that arithmetic, some members might be of the view that policy 
accommodation has been substantially re moved and that the Committee should 
halt the process of firming sometime soon.   Second, the devast ation in the Gulf 
region probably implies that more uncertainty attends the outlook, and this 
uncertainty is unlikely to be resolved soon, perhaps increasing the attractiveness 
of being more gradual in removing policy accommodation.  Third, the possibilities that elevated energy price s, on the one hand, could sap consumer 
confidence or, on the other, unanchor in flation expectations may require more 
nimble adjustments to the stance of po licy than consistent with the “measured 
pace” language. 
 
In prior discussions of statement language, some have expressed a 
preference for providing signals about th e future direction of policy only in 
unusual situations, if at all.  In that  view, guidance about interest rates, which 
seemed useful when significant disinflation  was a risk and at the outset of policy 
tightening, is no longer useful when the Committee is unsure about its actions at 
the next few meetings.  The simple expedi ent, then, would be to drop rows 5 and 
6 and any mention of the extent of  policy accommodation in Table 1. 
 Others have argued, however, that pr oviding information about the future 
direction of the federal funds rate helps the public make better-informed decisions, enhancing the effectiveness of  monetary policy.  Moreover, simply 
stating that the Committee was not certain  whether the next move in rates would 
be up or down would, on this view, be useful information to market participants.

information on the effects of Hurricane Ka trina, as well as of the cumulative 
tightening of policy to date, before resumi ng policy firming—even if that wait could 
be extended.  Such a view could be conveyed  to the public by striking sentence 2 from 
the draft statement for Alternative A.  The statement could also drop the word 
“action” that now appears in row 5 in or der to suggest that appropriate monetary Opening Up the Statement (cont.) 
 
One way of regaining flexibility about the range of future action while still 
providing such information would be to eliminate the “measured pace” language 
from the statement and move from the current practice of basing the risk assessment on appropriate policy to assuming explicitly that the current stance of 
policy will be kept unchanged for severa l quarters.  Under such an assumption, 
the assessments of the probabilities of lo wer or higher economic growth than is 
sustainable and of lower or higher inflatio n, along with an overall risk assessment 
if needed, can provide guidance about the fu ture direction of policy.  Rows 5 and 
6 of Table 1 in both columns A and B co uld be replaced with the following 
formula: 
 
The Committee’s economic outlook is such that, if the federal 
funds rate were maintained at its current level for the next several 
quarters, output growth is [less/as/more] likely to be above 
[as/than] below its sustainable pace.  Inflation over the same period 
is [less/as/more] likely to increa se [as to/than] decrease.  As a 
result, the Committee views the near-term risks to its dual 
objectives as [tilted to the downside/balanced/tilted to the upside].  
In any event, the Committee is prep ared to take the steps necessary 
to maintain price stability and sustainable economic growth. 
If the Committee desires to convey the sense that the current stance of policy is 
unsustainably easy, it could set both togg le switches to thei r “more” setting.  
That is, it would tell the public that, if maintained for the next few quarters, a 
nominal funds rate of 3½ percent (under  A) or 3¾ percent (under B) would 
likely foster a pickup in resource ut ilization and inflation.  As both 
measurements would point in the same direction, the overall risk balance 
sentence could be omitted in this case with no harm to clarity.

policy going forward would not necessarily in volve near-term tightening, and refer to 
“remaining” policy accommodation in  the first sentence in row 6. 
Money and Debt Forecasts 
(17) Under the Greenbook forecast, M2 growth  is projected to average about 
3 percent over the third and fourth quarters of 2005, leaving growth  for the year as a 
whole just under 3 percent (Table 2).  Velocity  is forecast to increase 3¼ percent this 
year.  Over 2006 and 2007, the expansion of M2  is forecast to pick up to 4¼ percent 
and 5 percent, respectively, with the veloci ty of M2 flattening out as the effects on 
opportunity costs of past policy firmings fade .  Domestic nonfinancial sector debt is 
forecast to decelerate over the forecast pe riod.  The expansion of household sector 
debt is projected to slow in the fourth quart er of 2005 to 8 percent and to continue to 
decline over subsequent quarters, reaching about a 6 percent rate by the end of 2007, 
as a moderation in home price appreciatio n prompts a significant deceleration of 
home mortgage debt.  The expansion of busine ss sector debt is also projected to slow, 
but more gradually.  Federal debt growth, by contrast, remains brisk over the forecast 
period, with growth rates of 7¾ percent, 8½  percent, and 8 percent, respectively, for 
the years 2005 though 2007.

Directive and Balance of  Risks Statement 
(18) Draft language for the directive and draf t risk assessments identical to those 
presented in Table 1 are provided below. 
Directive Wording 
The Federal Open Market Committee  seeks  monetary and financial 
conditions that will foster price st ability and promote sustainable growth 
in output.  To further its long-r un objectives, the Committee in the 
immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with 
MAINTAINING/increasing/REDUCING the federal funds rate AT/to 
an average of around ____________ 3½  percent. 
Risk Assessments  
A. The Committee perceives that, with appropriate monetary policy action, the upside and downside risks to th e attainment of both sustainable 
growth and price stability should be kept roughly equal.  With underlying 
inflation expected to be contained, the Committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured.  
Nonetheless, the Committee will respond to changes in economic 
prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability.

Inflation Indicator Based on M2
Note: P* is defined to equal M2 times V* divided by potential GDP. V*, or long-run velocity, is estimated
using average velocity over the 1959:Q1-to-1989:Q4 period and then, after a break, over the interval from
1993:Q1 to the present. For the forecast period, P* is based on the staff M2 forecast and P is simulated using a
short-run dynamic model relating P to P*. Blue areas indicate periods in which P* is notably less than P.
