MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES  
Recent Developments1 
(1) Investors had anticipated the FOMC’s de cision at its March meeting to raise 
the target federal funds rate 25 basis point s, to 4¾ percent, but the retention of the 
language that “some further policy firmin g may be needed” evidently led them to 
mark up somewhat their expected path for the federal funds rate.2  Subsequently, 
speeches by Federal Reserve officials, the re lease of the minutes of the March FOMC 
meeting, and the Chairman's testimony before the Joint Economic Committee were 
generally taken to suggest that the FOMC wa s more likely than had previously been 
thought to leave policy unchanged after one  more move.  Money market futures rates 
rose in response to key data releases that  were read as indicating greater global 
economic strength and higher inflation pres sures than had been expected.  On net, 
federal funds futures rates for the end of th is year and beyond increased 25 to 35 basis 
points, and the expected policy path currently  peaks at about 5.2 percent toward the 
end of this year before sloping down gradually over 2007 (Chart 1).  Option-implied uncertainty about the path for money marke t rates edged up but remains low in its 
historical range.  The Desk survey and futures quotes suggest that investors are 
virtually certain of a 25 basis point increase  in the target funds rate at the May FOMC 
meeting and see a roughly one-in-three chan ce of a like-sized move in June.   
(2) Over the intermeeting period, yields on two- and ten-year nominal Treasury 
securities rose 25 and 45 basis points, respect ively.  The ten-year rate, at 5.23 percent, 
                                          
 
1 Financial market quotes are as of the close of business on Thursday, May 4. 
2 The effective federal funds rate averaged 4.79 percent over the intermeeting period.  In the 
last few days, the funds rate traded on the firm side despite a sizable provision of reserves by 
the Desk, as reserve managers at banks once again anticipated policy firming by the 
Committee.  The Desk purchased $1.1 billion of Treasury coupon securities in the market.  
The volume of outstanding long-term RPs increased $1 billion, to $15 billion.

is now above its level just prior to the onset  of the current round of policy tightening.  
A rise in distant-horizon forward rates, possi bly owing to a modest rebound in term 
premiums, accounted importantly for this mo vement in yields (see box entitled “The 
Recent Rise in Distant-Horizon Forward Rates and Term Premiums”).  Yields on 
TIPS rose less than those on comparable-maturity nominal Treasury securities.  The 
15 basis point climb in near-term inflation compensation can largely be attributed to 
the rise in energy prices.  In contrast, with survey measures of long-run inflation 
expectations unchanged to 20 basis points hi gher, the 20 basis poin t increase in five-
to-ten-year forward inflation compensation appears to reflect both expectations of 
higher inflation and an increase in the inflation risk premium. 
(3) Major stock price indexes were up a bit over the intermeeting period, as 
positive first-quarter earnings reports more th an offset the negative  effects of higher 
energy prices and interest rates (Chart 2) .  The implied volatility of equity prices 
remained near historical lows.  With the ri se in long-term real Treasury yields, the 
equity premium is estimated to have narrowe d a bit, though it remains slightly above 
its average level of the past two decade s.  Measures of the credit quality of 
nonfinancial firms remained solid, supported by  gains in earnings and by strong and 
liquid balance sheets.  Spreads of yields  on investment-grade bonds over those on 
comparable-maturity Treasury securities were about unchanged, while spreads on 
speculative-grade bonds declined. 
(4) The trade-weighted exchange value of the dollar against major foreign 
currencies fell 4¾ percent on balance over the intermeeting period (Chart 3).  The 
dollar’s decline came amid fairly widespread  signs of stronger global growth that 
boosted investors’ expectations of furthe r monetary policy tightening abroad.  
Increased focus in public debate on risks po sed by the large U.S. external imbalance 
also appeared to erode investor support for the dollar.  The dollar dropped 3¼ percent versus the yen, about 4¾ percen t versus the euro, and nearly 5½ percent

 The Recent Rise in Distant-Horizo n Forward Rates and Term Premiums 
 
In the Treasury market, the nine-to-ten-year- ahead nominal forward rate climbed 60 basis 
points over the intermeeting period, while the co mparable indexed forward rate from TIPS 
rose about 35 basis points.  Thus, distant-hor izon forward inflation compensation increased 
about 25 basis points.  Judging from the staff’ s arbitrage-free term structure model, the ten-
year instantaneous forward nominal term premium—which includes compensation for 
inflation risk—moved up notably over the in termeeting period (lower left panel).  
Nonetheless, the estimated term premium remain s well below its histor ical average and is 
nearly a percentage point below its level at th e beginning of the current  tightening cycle.   
 
The recent rise in distant-horiz on forward rates appears to be a global phenomenon, with 
such rates posting substantial increases in othe r major industrialized countries (lower right 
panel).  The correlation between these fore ign and domestic forward rates has been 
particularly high over the last two years, sugg esting that their movements owe predominantly 
to international factors.  However, over the intermeeting period, forward rates have risen 
more in the United States than in foreign countries, and inflatio n compensation has moved 
up more in U.S. markets than in other countries, perhaps in part as a result of the recent 
depreciation of the dollar and con cerns that more is in store. 
 
The reasons for the apparent backup in U.S. term  premiums of late are hard to ascertain, but 
may include heightened inflation concerns, so me waning of foreign demand for Treasury 
securities that has been evid ent in recent auctions and in custody holdings at the Federal 
Reserve Bank of New York, and investors’ reassessment of the appropriate pricing of 
interest-rate risk.

versus the Canadian dollar.  The Canadian currency, and those of several other smaller 
commodity exporters, appeared to be boosted by the sharply higher prices of oil and 
some other key primary products.  On April 25, the Bank of Canada raised its policy 
rate 25 basis points and signaled that furthe r policy tightening was likely.  On May 3, 
the Reserve Bank of Australia also raised its policy rate 25 basis points.  Yields on 
long-term government securities in major fo reign industrial countries moved up 25 to 
30 basis points on balance, somewhat less th an increases in comparable U.S. yields 
over the period.  Based on returns on inflation-indexed securities, the advances in nominal yields abroad appear to owe mostly to higher real yields.  Stock prices in 
foreign industrial countries reco rded gains of 1 to 3 percent. 
(5) The dollar fell about 1¼ percent agains t an index of currencies of our other 
important trading partners.  
 
3  Upward pressure on Asian currencies 
may have been accentuated by the G-7 stat ement calling for “greater exchange rate 
flexibility…in emerging economies with la rge current account surpluses, especially 
China.”  Although Chinese authorities allo wed only a slight appreciation of the yuan 
over the period, they did announce some ch anges in foreign exchange regulations; 
they also raised their benchmark lending rate 27 basis points and issued guidance on lending to certain sectors intended to sl ow investment growth.  Central banks in 
Brazil and Mexico cut their policy rates again, but the Bank of Mexico added that it saw no room for further easing for the fore seeable future.  Both countries continued 
to benefit from favorable financial condit ions:  EMBI+ spreads narrowed, and stock

prices recorded increases close to 10 percent.  The Brazilian real strengthened 
substantially, while the Mexi can peso was about unchanged versus the dollar over the 
period. 
(6) Domestic nonfinancial sector debt is estimated to have grown at a 
9¼ percent annual rate in the first quarter , down only slightly fr om the brisk pace in 
2005 (Chart 4).  Business sector debt appears to have expanded at an 8¾ percent rate, 
supported by robust net issuance of U. S. corporate bonds and a double-digit 
expansion of business loans at commercial ba nks.  Results from the latest Senior Loan 
Officer Opinion Survey indicate that bank s eased standards and terms for C&I loans 
further.  In the household sector, consumer credit has continued to expand slowly.  
Although only limited data are currently av ailable, growth of household mortgage 
debt is projected to have moderated somewhat in the first quarter against a backdrop 
of higher mortgage interest rates, some si gns of a deceleration in house prices, and 
reports in the Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey indicating lower demand for residential mortgage loans.  Federal debt is estimated to have expanded at nearly a 13 
percent rate in the first quarter, a pace roughl y in line with first-quarter growth a year 
earlier.   (7) M2 advanced at a 6½ percent pace duri ng the first quarter, somewhat below 
the growth rate of nominal GDP, and expa nded moderately in April.  This recent 
growth has been due importantly to increase s in small time deposits, which have been 
buoyed by favorable offering rates.

Economic Outlook 
(8) The sharp run-up in energy prices over the intermeeting period, together 
with somewhat larger-than-expected increases in core consumer prices, led the staff to 
boost its inflation outlook for the near term.  News on output and spending also came 
in above staff expectations, but little of this  additional strength is expected to persist 
in the forecast.  In view of the intensification of inflati on pressures, the staff forecast 
now assumes that the Committee will leave th e funds rate at 5 percent after this 
meeting rather than easing slightly next yea r, as was the case in the March Greenbook.  
In the current forecast, longer-term Treasury yields edge lower as market expectations 
for monetary policy come into alignment with  the staff assumption, equity prices rise 
at a rate sufficient to produce risk-adjus ted returns about equal to those on fixed-
income instruments, and house price appr eciation slows substantially.  The real 
foreign exchange value of the dollar against a broad basket of currencies is assumed to 
decline at an average rate of a little over 2 percent over the forecast period.  In line 
with futures quotes, the staff forecasts th at the price of West Texas intermediate 
crude oil will be around $75 per barrel ov er the projection period, roughly $11 per 
barrel higher than in the last forecast.  Ag ainst this backdrop, the staff projects that 
real GDP will expand 3¾ percent in 2006 and 3 percent in 2007, close to the March 
Greenbook projection.  With output growing a bit less quickly than potential next 
year, the unemployment rate is expected to creep up to 5 percent, the staff’s estimate 
of the NAIRU.  Core PCE inflation is no w expected to be 2¼ percent this year, 
slightly above the March forecast, but to ed ge down to 2 percent next year as energy 
prices flatten out.  Total PCE prices are se en as rising about 2½ percent and 2 percent 
in 2006 and 2007, respectively.

Longer-Run Scenarios 
(9) Simulations of the FRB/US model prov ide a longer-term perspective that 
could help inform the Committee’s near-ter m policy choice.  To that end, staff 
extended the basic features of the Gr eenbook outlook through 2010.  In that 
extension, monetary policy adjusts to hold co re PCE inflation at about 2 percent.  In 
the absence of any significant supply s hocks or changes in expectations, the 
unemployment rate remains near the 5 percent staff estimate of the NAIRU.  The 
associated medium-run value of  the equilibrium real funds rate is about 2¾ percent, 
which implies a modest step-down in the nom inal funds rate to roughly 4¾ percent 
after 2007.  With this as the baseline, the model can be used to simulate the effects of 
alternative assumptions for monetary polic y over the next fe w years.  In these 
simulations, participants in financial mar kets—including those in the equity, bond, 
and foreign exchange markets—are assumed to understand fully the forces shaping 
the economic outlook, whereas households and firms are assumed to form their 
expectations using more limited information.   
(10) To shed light on the implications of en ding the process of  policy firming,  
the first simulation considers a policy trajectory  in which the federal funds rate is held 
constant at its current level through 2010 ra ther than being raised to 5 percent as in 
the Greenbook.  The policy path beyond 2010 is  set using the aggressive Taylor rule 
as described below in the explanatory notes  for policy rules.  As  shown in the upper 
left panel of Chart 5, the funds rate path in this alternative scenario (the dashed line) is 
a bit lower than under the extended baselin e (the solid line) over the next two years 
and a bit higher thereafter.  Under the a ssumption that this policy path is fully 
anticipated by financial market participants, th e alternative scenario produces a slightly 
lower trajectory for longer-term real interest  rates over the next two years relative to 
the baseline.  This in turn generates a mode stly lower path for the unemployment rate

during 2007 and 2008 and slightly higher core inflation through the remainder of the 
decade.  
(11) Because policy paths that merely hold in flation around its current rate might 
not be viewed as acceptable by the Commi ttee, the next set of simulations examines 
policies that would generate a more rapid decline in core inflation toward an inflation 
objective of 1½ percent.  In these simulations, the funds rate reaches 5¾ percent later 
this year and remains at that rate through at least mid-2008 (Chart 6).  Two different 
scenarios illustrate the role of inflation expectations in determining the macroeconomic effects of the additional policy tightening.  In one, long-term inflation 
expectations respond only sluggishly to infl ation outcomes (the dashed lines); in the 
other, expectations are assumed to converge to the 1½ percent target by late 2008, as 
might be the case if the public became  convinced that the Committee had that 
inflation goal (the dotted lines).  In the first scenario, making significant progress in 
reducing inflation involves holding the fund s rate at 5¾ percent through the end of 
2008 and then cutting it to 4¼ percent over the course of 2009.  Under these 
conditions, the unemployment rate rises steadily to about 5½ percent over the next 
two years and does not start to return to th e NAIRU until late in the decade; this slack 
helps generate a slow decline in core inflatio n.  In the second scenario, the more rapid 
adjustment of long-run inflation expectatio ns brings about a more rapid decline in 
actual inflation with less slack in economic  activity.  As a result, policymakers can 
begin cutting the funds rate noticeably earlie r, and because investors fully anticipate 
the timing of the future policy easing, no minal and real yields on longer-term bonds 
rise somewhat less than in the first scenario.

Short-Run Policy Alternatives  
(12) This Bluebook presents three alternatives for the Committee’s 
consideration, summarized by the draft statem ents in Table 1.  Under Alternative A, 
the Committee leaves the federal funds rate unchanged at this meeting.  It also 
indicates a best guess that, if any adjustme nt to the stance of policy subsequently 
proved necessary, it likely would be upward .  Under Alternative B, the target for the 
federal funds rate is raised another 25 ba sis points at this meeting, and the risk 
assessment suggests that the Committee may pa use in June.  Under Alternative C, the 
target for the funds rate is raised 50 ba sis points and the risks are described as 
balanced without mention of additional policy action.  All three alternatives provide a 
fuller description of the rationale for policy action and some forward-looking 
language about the economic outlook.   
(13) If the Committee believes that the outcome projected by the staff in the 
Greenbook forecast is both likely and best  balances the Federal Reserve’s dual 
objectives, then it may wish to couple anot her 25 basis point firming at this meeting 
with a risk assessment that hints that the tigh tening cycle may be co ming to a close, as 
in Alternative B .  A quarter-point move at this meeting would brin g the cumulative 
tightening since June 2004 to 4 percentage  points.  While a portion of that rise has 
been offset by higher inflation, real s hort-term interest rates have been boosted 
appreciably as well, from belo w zero to around 2¾ percent as measured using trailing 
core PCE inflation as a proxy for expected in flation.  The real federal funds rate has 
been lifted to around the middle of the ra nge of model-based estimates of its short-
run equilibrium (Chart 7) and to a level about equal to the equilibrium rate implicit in 
the Greenbook projection.  Members may also  view the recent backup in longer-term 
rates as augmenting the financial restraint im posed by higher short-term interest rates.  
Indeed, under the staff forecast, the mai ntenance of the nominal funds rate at 
5 percent through 2007 would foster financ ial conditions that would slow output

2005 seems largely to have 
reflected temporary or special 
factors. Economic growth has 
rebounded strongly in the current 
quarter but appears likely to 
moderate to a more sustainable 
pace. Economic growth rebounded to nearly a 
5 percent annual rate in the first quarter.  The 
Committee sees growth as likely to moderate  
to a sustainable pace , partly reflecting a 
gradual cooling of the housing market, other 
lagged responses to prev ious rate increases, 
and the effects of energy price increases.   Economic growth rebounded to nearly a 
5 percent annual rate in the first quarter.  
The Committee sees growth as likely to 
moderate  toward a more sustainable 
pace, partly reflecting a gradual cooling 
of the housing market, other lagged 
responses to previous rate increases, and 
the effects of energy price increases.   Economic growth rebounded to nearly 
a 5 percent annual rate in the first

likely to moderate  somewhat in coming 
quarters, though data confirming a slowing in growth have been sparse.    
Rationale 3. As yet, the run-up in the prices 
of energy and other commodities 
appears to have had only a 
modest effect on core inflation, 
ongoing productivity gains have 
helped to hold the growth of unit 
labor costs in check, and inflation 
expectations remain contained. 
Still, possible increases in 
resource utilization, in 
combination with the elevated 
prices of energy and other 
commodities, have the potential 
to add to inflation pressures. As yet, the run-up in the prices of energy and 
other commodities appears to have had only 
a modest effect on core inflation, ongoing 
productivity gains have  helped to hold the 
growth of unit labor costs in check, and 
inflation expectations remain contained.  The 
Committee expects core inflation to remain well contained.  Still, possible increases in 
resource utilization, in combination with the 
elevated prices of energy and other 
commodities, have the potential to add to 
inflation pressures.  As yet, the run-up in the prices of energy 
and other commodities appears to have 
had only a modest effect on core 
inflation,  and ongoing productivity gains 
have helped to hold the growth of unit 
labor costs in check.   The Committee 
expects core inflation to remain contained.  However, the recent climb in 
energy and other commodity prices, an 
apparent slight rise in inflation 
expectations, and possible increases in 
resource utilization have the potential to add to inflation pressures.  As yet, the run-up in the prices of 
energy and other commodities appears

core inflation,  and ongoing productivity 
gains have helped to hold the growth of 
unit labor costs in check .  However, the 
recent climb in energy and other commodity prices, an apparent rise in 
inflation expectations, and  possible 
increases in resource  utilization have the 
potential to add to inflation pressures.  
4. The Committee judges that 
some further policy firming may 
be needed to keep the risks to 
the attainment of both 
sustainable economic growth and 
price stability roughly in balance.  Against this backdrop, the Committee 
preferred to await ad ditional information 
about economic developments before taking 
any further action.  The Committee sees the 
risks to its price stability objective as slightly 
to the upside and judges it more likely that its 
next policy action will be  a tightening rather 
than an easing.   To keep the risks to the attainment of 
both sustainable economic growth and 
price stability roughly in balance, some 
further policy firming may be needed.  
The Committee judges that any 
additional firming is likely to be modest.  However, the extent and timing of any 
such firming will depend importantly on 
the evolution of the economic outlook as 
implied by incoming information. The Committee judges that , with this 
action, the risks to the attainment of 
both sustainable economic growth and price stability  are roughly in balance.

will respond to changes in 
economic prospects as needed to 
foster these objectives.

Equilibrium Real Rate Chart: Explanatory Notes  
The equilibrium real rate is the real federal funds rate that , if maintained, would be projected to return output to its 
potential level over time.  For the first three measures listed below, the short-run equilibri um rate is defined as the 
rate that would close the output gap in twelve qua rters given the corresponding model’s projection of the 
economy.  For the first two measures, the medium-run concept is the value of the real federal funds rate projected 
to keep output at potential in seven years under the assumption that monetary policy acts to bring actual and 
potential output into line in the short run and then keeps them equal thereafter.  The TIPS-based factor model 
measure provides an estimate of market expectations for th e real federal funds rate seven years ahead.  The actual 
real federal funds rate is constructe d as the difference between the nominal ra te and realized inflation, where the 
nominal rate is measured as the quarterly average of th e observed federal funds rate, and realized inflation is 
given by the log difference between the staff’s estimate of the core PCE price index and its lagged value four 
quarters earlier.  For the current quarter, the nominal rate  is specified as the target federal funds rate on the 
Bluebook publication date.   
Measure Description 
Single-equation 
Model   The measure of the equilibrium real rate in the single-equation model is based on an 
estimated aggregate-demand relationship between  the current value of the output gap and 
its lagged values as well as the lagged values of the real federal funds rate.  In light of this 
model’s simple structure, the short-run measur e of the equilibrium real rate depends only 
on the recent position of output relative to potential, and the medium-run measure is virtually constant.
 
Small Structural 
Model  The small-scale model of the economy consists of equations for five variables: the output 
gap, the equity premium, the federal budget surp lus, the trend growth rate of output, and 
the real bond yield.  Unlike the estimates from the single-equation model, values of the equilibrium real rate also depend directly  on conditions associated with output growth, 
fiscal policy, and capital markets.
 
Large Model 
(FRB/US)  Estimates of the equilibrium real rate using FRB/US—the staff’s large-scale econometric 
model of the U.S. economy—depend on a very broad array of economic factors, some of 
which take the form of projected values of the model’s exogenous variables.  These projections make use of several simple fo recasting rules which are appropriate for the 
three-year horizon relevant for the short-r un concept but are less sensible over longer 
horizons.  Thus, we report only the shor t-run measure for the FRB/US model.
 
Greenbook-
consistent  Measures of the equilibrium real rate cannot  be directly obtained from the Greenbook 
forecast, because the Greenbook is not based on a formal model.  Rather, we use the 
FRB/US model in conjunction with an extended version of the Greenbook forecast to 
derive a Greenbook-consistent measure.  FRB/ US is first add-factored so that its 
simulation matches the extended Greenbook forecast, and then a second simulation is run 
off this baseline to determine the value of the real federal funds rate that closes the output 
gap.  The medium-run concept of the equilibrium real rate is not computed because it 
requires a relatively long extension of the Greenbook forecast.  
TIPS-based 
Factor Model Yields on TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) reflect investors’ expectations of 
the future path of real interest rates, but also include term and liquidity premiums.  The 
TIPS-based measure of the equilibrium real ra te is constructed using the seven-year-ahead 
instantaneous real forward rate derived fro m TIPS yields as of the Bluebook publication 
date.  This forward rate is adjusted to remove estimates of the term and liquidity 
premiums based on a three-factor arbitrage -free term-structure model applied to TIPS 
yields, nominal yields, and inflation.  Because TIPS indexation is based on the total CPI, 
this measure is also adjusted for the me dium-term difference—projected at 40 basis 
points—between total CPI inflation and core PCE inflation.

growth to a pace a little belo w that of its potential, sl ightly easing pressures on 
resources and promoting a modest downward tilt in core inflation to rates below 
2 percent late in the forecast period an d beyond.  Even if the Committee is not 
convinced that output growth would slow to this extent if the funds rate were 
maintained at 5 percent, it might nonetheless believe that the stance of policy is not 
far from neutral.  If so, a pause in policy firming before long would be unlikely to 
jeopardize the Committee’s price stability obj ective and might be appropriate to allow 
a better assessment at a later date of the cumulative effects of its policy actions. 
(14) Under Alternative B, the rationale paragr aph could indicate that spending is 
likely to slow because of a cooling of the housing market and the restraint imparted by 
increases in energy prices and interest ra tes.  The Committee could repeat its analysis 
in the March statement of recent factors aff ecting inflation, but then acknowledge that 
a slight rise in inflation expectations could also add to inflation pressures.  To treat its 
dual objectives symmetrically, row 3 includ es the Committee’s expectation that core 
inflation will remain contained, just as th ere is forward-looking language on economic 
growth in the previous row.  In view of  the additional quarter-point firming that 
would be implemented under this alternative,  the risk assessment might be softened a 
little relative to that released after the la st meeting by adding “The Committee judges 
that any additional firming is likely to be modest” and adopting some of the language 
of the Chairman’s recent testimony:  “the ex tent and timing of any such firming will 
depend importantly on the evolution of th e economic outlook as implied by incoming 
information.”  Inclusion of the reference to  “timing” is intended to suggest that 
additional firming would not necessarily take  place at the June meeting.  If the 
Committee saw only a small probability that it would act again in June, it could tune 
the message by replacing the second senten ce of row 4 with “T he Committee judges 
that additional firming, if any, is likely to be modest.”  In either case, the dependency 
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)
Page 19 of 41
of future policy actions on data could be underscored by essentially reiterating the 
final sentence from the March announcement.  
(15) Investors seem sure of a 25 basis point hike in the federal funds rate at this 
meeting and see only about a one-in-three ch ance of a similar move in June.  The 
statement accompanying Alternative B would li kely maintain or slightly increase these 
odds.  Market interest rates could back up  a few basis points, and downward pressure 
on the dollar might be reduced a bit, at le ast for a time, and equity prices could 
decline. 
(16) The sizable rise over the intermeeting period in long-term nominal interest 
rates (which apparently included a signif icant pickup in compensation for expected 
inflation), the weakening of the exchange va lue of the dollar, and the rise in some 
survey measures of inflation expectations co uld be read by members as evidence of an 
erosion in the public’s confidence in the Committee’s commitment to price stability.  
If so, the combination of a half-point acti on at this meeting and the words presented 
in Alternative C  might be appealing.  With energy prices having risen sharply further 
in recent weeks, the Committee could be concerned that elevated energy and 
commodity prices and relatively high levels of resource utilization may begin to leave a 
more distinct imprint on core inflation and inflation expectations.  Moreover, 
members may believe that core inflation curre ntly is already at or above the upper end 
of an acceptable range, inclining them to  foster a steeper downward trajectory in 
inflation than that forecast in the Gree nbook.  In that regard, the alternative 
simulation provided earlier su ggests that the nominal federal funds rate would need to 
reach 5¾ percent by year-end to foster a 1½  percent inflation goal over the next few 
years.   
(17) The rationale portion of the policy stat ement associated with Alternative C 
could temper the expectation of a moderati on in growth with the observation that 
“data confirming a slowing in growth have b een sparse.”  As in March, the inflation 
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)
Page 20 of 41
paragraph could cite limited energy-price  pass-through and productivity gains as 
having helped to hold inflation in check,  but would not indicate that the Committee 
expected core inflation to remain contained.   Reasserting that “inflation expectations 
are contained” might be problematic, and, as in Alternative B, rising inflation 
expectations could be cited as a factor that  could add to inflation pressures.  In light 
of the size of the policy move, the Committee might want to declare that the risks to 
its dual objectives  are balanced.   
(18) The policy action and statement associat ed with Alternative C would catch 
market participants unawares.  Real bond yiel ds could jump up noti ceably; the rise in 
nominal yields would be somewhat less if inflation expectations declined—but that 
would depend on the extent to which investor s took the action as an assertion of the 
Committee’s anti-inflation resolve.  The re cent tendency toward weakness in the 
foreign exchange value of the dollar would likely be checked, and stock prices would 
decline.  Given the size of the policy surpri se, volatility, both actual and implied, could 
rise. 
(19) The likely reaction in financial markets, which could be sizable, to a 50 basis 
point increase in the target for the federa l funds rate might diminish the appeal of 
Alternative C for the Committee.  But some  of the rationale language of this 
alternative could be used to stiffen the policy statement announcing a quarter-point 
increase and thus make it more likely that financial markets would build in high odds 
of a like-sized action in June.  For in stance, the Committee could combine the 
rationale paragraphs of Alternative C with the risk assessment of Alternative B.  To 
make it more likely that market participants price in an additional move, the 
Committee could strike the sentence characteri zing additional firming as likely to be 
“modest” in row 4 of Alternative B.  Th is might be favored if the Committee was 
impressed by the resilience of aggregate deman d in the face of the substantial increase 
in energy prices and concerned that the mo mentum of spending could push the level 
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)
Page 21 of 41
of output well above the economy’s potenti al.  Indeed, if the Committee harbored a 
suspicion that economic slack had already b een more than eliminated, it might see 
increased inflation pressures as a palpable ri sk.  In that vein, members might read the 
most recent figures on new and existing ho me sales as suggesting that the housing 
market, while off its peak, is not cooling quickly enough to provide much assurance 
that overall economic growth is in the proce ss of slowing to potential.  In that regard, 
the “domestic boom” alternative simulation  in the Greenbook, which puts the funds 
rate at 6¼ percent by year-end 2007, may st rike some members as an uncomfortably 
plausible outcome.      
(20) In contrast, the Committee may believe th at further policy tightening at this 
meeting is not necessary or desirable and that, at least for now, maintaining the 
current stance of policy is appropriate, as in Alternative A .  As noted previously, the 
cumulative firming of policy to date has been significant, and the real federal funds 
rate is now well within the range of model-based estimates of its equilibrium value.  In these circumstances, the Committee may wish to pause to obtain more information 
that would be useful in assessing whethe r further action will be necessary.  Put 
differently, policy accommodation now appears to have been eliminated, and, with 
core inflation remaining contained—and perh aps believed likely to edge lower over 
time—despite sharp increases in energy  and commodity prices, the Committee may 
not feel a need to move from a roughly neutra l posture to a restrictive stance.  That is 
the message of the simulation presented earlier:   If the equilibrium real rate is in the 
neighborhood of 2¾ percent, a 2 percent infl ation goal could be achieved by holding 
the nominal funds rate at 4¾ percent.  In deed, estimated monetary policy rules imply 
that the existing stance of policy is abou t appropriate or even a little firmer than 
would be predicted by past Committee behavi or (Chart 8).  Model simulations using a 
number of simple policy rules also suggest that further tightening may not be required 
at this time (Chart 9).  And even if me mbers believe that furt her tightening could

For the rules described below, it denotes the federal funds rate for quarter t, while the explanatory 
variables include the staff’s estimate of tr ailing four-quarter co re PCE inflation ( πt), its forecasts  
of inflation two and three quarters ahead ( πt+2|t and πt+3|t), its assessment of the current output gap 
(*
ttyy− ), its one-quarter-ahead forecast of the output gap (*
1| 1|tt ttyy+ +− ), its three-quarter-ahead 
forecast of annual average GDP growth relative to potential (44*
3| 3|tt ttyy+ + Δ− Δ ), and the assumed value 
of policymakers’ long-run inflation objective (*π).    
Rule prescriptions are computed using dynamic simu lations of the FRB/US model, implemented as 
though the rule is followed starting at this FOMC m eeting.  This quarter’s prescription is a weighted 
average of the actual value of the federal funds rate thus far this quarter and the value obtained from the 
FRB/US model simulations using the tim ing of this meeting within the quarter to determine the weights.  
Finally, for the forecast-based rule a nd the first-difference rule, it should be noted that prescriptions near 
the end of the Greenbook horizon also depend on an extension of the Greenbook baseline forecast. 
  
Estimated Policy Rules :  Estimation is performed using real -time quarterly data taken from the 
Greenbook and staff memoranda closest to the middle of  each quarter.  The specifi c lag structure of the 
outcome-based rule is chosen according to the Ba yesian information criterion over the sample period 
starting from 1988Q1.  The forecast-based rule differs  from the outcome-based rule in that it also 
permits staff forecasts of inflation and the outpu t gap to be among the explanatory variables.  
Confidence intervals, shown only for the outcome-based rule, are base d on stochastic simulations of the 
FRB/US model, where the shocks are randomly drawn from the set of model e quations residuals for the 
period 1986-2004.  The following table in dicates the specificati on of each rule and its root mean squared 
error (RMSE) over the sample 1993:1-2005:4.

eventually prove necessary to address up side risks to inflation, they may see no 
urgency to implement such restraint.  Such an assessment might be importantly 
influenced by members’ regional knowledge of  the housing situation.  With national 
data, particularly survey information, poi nting to some cooling, the Committee may 
put some weight on the “housing slump” alternative simulation in the Greenbook, 
which suggests that if significant confid ence effects accompany a drop in housing 
values, then considerably easier monetary policy would be warranted. 
(21) The rationale section of the Commi ttee’s statement associated with 
Alternative A could begin like that in Alte rnative B but soften the characterization of 
the outlook for growth to “likely to modera te to a sustainable pace.”  It could use 
essentially the same paragraph discussing infl ation as that for Alternative B, but retain 
the assertion that “inflation expectati ons remain contained” and emphasize the 
expectation that core inflation will remai n “well contained.”  The risk assessment 
might be revised considerably from that empl oyed at recent meetings.  In particular, it 
could indicate that “Against this backdrop, the Committee preferred to await 
additional information about economic developments before taking any further 
action.  The Committee sees the risks to its price stability objective as slightly to the 
upside and judges it more likely that its next policy action will be a tightening rather than an easing.”  To accommodate thos e changes, the final sentence of the risk 
assessment might be modified slightly to  read “In any event, the Committee will 
respond to changes in the economic outlook, as implied by incoming information, as 
needed to foster its objectives of sustai nable economic growth and price stability.”   
(22) Both the absence of policy action and the statement associated with 
Alternative A would come as a considerable  surprise to market participants.  Short-
term market rates would probably drop by about 25 basis points as market 
participants removed all but a small probability of near-term policy firming.  The 
effect on bond yields would depend in pa rt on whether inflati on expectations were 
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)
Page 26 of 41
adversely affected by the lack of tightening  at this meeting and the suggestion that 
policy could be on hold for some time.  If inflation expectations were unperturbed, 
bond yields most likely would decline, st ock markets rally, and the foreign exchange 
value of the dollar weaken. 
Money and Debt Forecasts 
(23) Under the Greenbook forecast, M2 growth is projected to expand 5 percent 
this year, restrained by a further increase in the opportunity cost of holding M2.  As a 
result, M2 velocity would rise about 1½ per cent, after increases of 1½ and 2½ percent 
in 2004 and 2005, respectively.  Next year, M2 growth is forecast at 5½ percent, in 
line with the expansion in nominal GDP, as opportunity costs are expected to be 
about unchanged on balance foll owing the leveling off of short-term market interest 
rates. 
(24) Domestic nonfinancial sector debt growth is expected to slow to 
7¼ percent this year from last year’s 9½ pe rcent increase.  Household debt growth is 
likely to fall off fairly sharply, reflectin g a deceleration in mortgage debt, but at 
8 percent is nonetheless projected to remain re latively brisk.  Business sector debt is 
seen as expanding 7½ percent, only a li ttle lower than last year’s pace, with the 
proceeds of a considerable portion of the borrowing slated to finance equity 
retirement.  Despite the wideni ng of the federal budget de ficit, federal debt growth 
slows to 6¾ percent in 2006.  Next year, overall debt growth is projected to drop

Directive and Balance of  Risks Statement 
(25) Draft language for the directive and draf t risk assessments identical to those 
presented in Table 1 are provided below. 
Directive Wording 
The Federal Open Market Committee  seeks monetary and financial 
conditions that will foster price st ability and promote sustainable growth 
in output.  To further its long-r un objectives, the Committee in the 
immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with 
MAINTAINING/increasing/REDUCING the federal funds rate AT/to an average of around ____________ 4
¾percent.   
Risk Assessments  
A.    Against this backdrop, the Co mmittee preferred to await additional 
information about economic developments before taking any 
further action.  The Committee sees the risks to its price stability 
objective as slightly to the upside and judges it more likely that its 
next policy action will be a tightening  rather than an easing.  In any 
event, the Committee will respond to changes in the economic 
outlook, as implied by incoming info rmation, as needed to foster its 
objectives of sustainable economic growth and price stability.   
B.    To keep the risks to the atta inment of both sustainable economic 
growth and price stability roughly in balance, some further policy 
firming may be needed.  The Commi ttee judges that any additional 
firming is likely to be modest.  However, the extent and timing of any such firming will depend impor tantly on the evolution of the 
economic outlook as implied by in coming information.  In any 
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)
Page 29 of 41
event, the Committee will respond to changes in economic 
prospects as needed to support the attainment of its objectives. 
C.    The Committee judges that, with th is action, the risks to the attainment 
of both sustainable economic growth and price stability are roughly in 
balance.  In any event, the Comm ittee will respond to changes in 
economic prospects as needed to foster these objectives.

Inflation Indicator Based on M2
Note: P* is defined to equal M2 times V* divided by potential GDP. V*, or long-run velocity, is estimated
using average velocity over the 1959:Q1-to-1989:Q4 period and then, after a break, over the interval from
1993:Q1 to the present. For the forecast period, P* is based on the staff M2 forecast and P is simulated using a
short-run dynamic model relating P to P*. Blue areas indicate periods in which P* is notably less than P.
