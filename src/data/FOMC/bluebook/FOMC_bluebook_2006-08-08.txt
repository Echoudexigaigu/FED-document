MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES  
Recent Developments 
(1) The FOMC’s decision at its June meetin g to increase the federal funds rate 
target by 25 basis points to 5¼ percent was widely anticipated, but market participants 
apparently read the accompanying statement as indicating that a near-term pause was 
more likely than had been foreseen, and th e expected path of the nominal funds rate 
edged lower.  Subsequently, policy expectati ons jumped in response to the release of 
June consumer price data, but dropped following the Chairman’s semiannual 
monetary policy testimony and declined furthe r after the release of the minutes of the 
June FOMC meeting (Chart 1).  Both of th ese communications were apparently read 
as indicating that, while the FOMC was concerned about elevated readings on inflation, it viewed price pressures as li kely to abate over co ming quarters.  Policy 
expectations were also damped by incoming data on economic activity over the 
intermeeting period that were somewhat softer than expected. (2) Futures quotes suggest that investors now put the likelihood of a quarter-
point increase in the target rate at this  meeting at around 35 percent, down from 
about 70 percent before the June meeting; the expected path of the funds rate is 
essentially flat for the remainder of the ye ar.  Further ahead, futures rates now point 
to a more pronounced downward tilt to the expected path of policy next year.  In 
contrast to futures-market investors, resp ondents to the Desk’s survey of primary 
dealers appear to expect a somewhat fi rmer near-term policy stance, placing a 
probability of about 50 percent on a quarter-point action at the August meeting; almost all respondents expect a tightening at one of the next three meetings.  The primary dealers also expect the August FO MC statement to acknowledge that core 
inflation readings are still elevated, to de scribe economic growth as moderating, and

to indicate that, while the Committee expects slower growth to restrain inflation going 
forward, it remains concerned about inflatio n risks.  Despite the evident uncertainty 
over the outcome of the August meeting, short-term Eurodollar implied volatilities 
rose modestly since the June meeting but have remained low. 
(3) The federal funds rate averaged 5.23 pe rcent over the intermeeting period.  
The implementation of the Board’s revised Payment System Risk policy on July 20 
went smoothly, in part because practices  in the federal funds and other money 
markets have adjusted in response to the policy change (see the box on page 5).1 
(4) Consistent with the revisi on to monetary policy expectations, yields on two- 
and ten-year nominal Treasury securities  fell about 30 basis points over the 
intermeeting period.  Yields on TIPS declin ed about in line with those on comparable 
nominal Treasury securities, leaving inflat ion compensation little changed, while some 
survey-based measures of inflation expect ations ticked down.  Monetary policy 
communications and the softer growth outl ook apparently led investors to believe 
that, despite the disappointing recent news on consumer prices and further increases 
in energy prices, inflation would be contained going forward even with a lower path 
of policy. 
(5) Broad stock price indexes posted modest increases, on net, over the 
intermeeting period (Chart 2).  Equity pric es were buoyed by earnings reports that 
were mainly solid and by FOMC communica tions that were seen as signaling a 
possible end to the current phase of policy tightening, but these gains were partly 
offset by concerns about turm oil in the Middle East, associ ated oil price increases, and 
negative second-quarter earnings re ports from a few high-profile firms.   The equity 
risk premium rose slightly, and implied volatility of the S&P 500 remained somewhat 
                                           
1 Over the intermeeting period, the Desk purc hased $1.6 billion of Treasury bills from 
foreign customers and $0.5 billi on of Treasury coupon securities  in the market.  The Desk 
also redeemed $3.9 billion of Treasury cou pon securities.  The volume of outstanding long-
term RPs increased $1 bi llion, to $12 billion.

above its average over the first four mont hs of the year.  Business default rates 
remained low.  Spreads of yields on investment-grade bonds over those on 
comparable-maturity Treasury securities were about unchanged, while spreads on 
speculative-grade bonds widened some; both stayed narrow by historical standards. 
(6) Heightened tensions in the Middle East contributed to volatile conditions in 
foreign financial markets over the intermeeting period, with declines in U.S. interest 
rates an important common factor in  foreign financial developments.2  Yields on

 Changes in the Federal Funds Market in  Response to the Revised PSR Policy 
On July 20, 2006, the Board’s revised Paymen ts System Risk (PSR) policy took effect.  
Under the revised policy, the Reserve Banks will release principal and interest (P&I) 
payments on securities issued by governme nt-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) and certain 
international organizations only when the entity’s Federal Reserve account contains 
sufficient funds to cover the payments.  In th e past, the GSEs had routinely incurred very 
large daylight overdrafts, especially on days of sizable P&I payments.  Nevertheless, implementation of the policy has resulted in no  disruptions to the payment system or the 
federal funds market, including on July 25, th e first day on which large P&I payments were 
made. 
The GSEs have reportedly relied on several strategies to comply with the new PSR 
policy, including tapping the increasingly acti ve early-return federal funds market.  Under 
early-return contracts, borrowers are obliged to  return funds to the lender at a specified 
time, typically between 9:30 and 11:00 a.m., that  is earlier than under the regular-return 
arrangements.  Early-return funds tend to tr ade about 2 to 4 basis points below regular-
return federal funds.  Based on reports from  federal funds brokers, early-return federal 
funds accounted for as much as one-fifth of the brokered federal funds market on July 25.  The lower rate at which early-return federal funds trade and their increasing share of the 
market implies that the effective federal funds rate will tend to understate the average rate 
for regular-return federal funds.  This effect  is particularly pronounced on days when early-
return contracts account for a relatively larg e share of federal funds trades.  Desk and 
Board staff are studying the implications of the policy change and th e early-return market 
for the effective rate and the funds market in general.

generally by less than their U.S. counterparts (Chart 3).  In Canada, yields fell about as 
much as in the United States, as the Bank of Canada reiterated on July 13 that it 
considered its current policy stance to be consistent with achieving its inflation 
objective over the medium term.  In contra st, bond yields in Japan and the United 
Kingdom were about unchanged on balance as declines early in the intermeeting 
period were reversed later when indicators of economic activity came in stronger than 
expected.  As expected, both the European Ce ntral Bank and the Bank of Japan raised 
policy interest rates 25 basis points; for Japan, this move marked the end of the zero-
interest-rate target.  The Bank of Englan d surprised markets this morning with a 
25 basis point increase and warned that inflation is likely to stay above its target “for a while.”  The dollar appreciated about 1 per cent against the Canadian dollar but fell a 
bit more than 2 percent on average against th e currencies of other industrial countries.  
On balance, the trade-weighted index of th e dollar against other major currencies fell 
1 percent.  As in the United  States, broad share price in dexes in foreign industrial 
countries rose moderately. 
(7) Equity values rebounded vigorously in  most emerging markets, partly in 
response to the decline in U.S. interest rates.  Mexican equity prices were among the 
strongest performers, spurred by the appare nt victory of Felipe Calderón in Mexico’s 
presidential election.  EMBI+ spreads d eclined around 20 and 35 basis points for 
Mexico and Brazil, respectively.  The dollar  fell about 3½ percent against the Mexican 
peso and 1 percent against the real.  The dollar also fell against most Asian currencies, 
including a ¼ percent decline against the Chinese renminbi.  Overall, the dollar 
depreciated 1¼ percent against an index of currencies of other important U.S. trading 
partners. 
(8) Debt of the nonfinancial business sector  expanded at an 8¾ percent annual 
rate in the second quarter, down only a bi t from its rapid first-quarter pace.  C&I 
loans, commercial paper, and corporate bonds all posted solid gains.  In July, business

loan growth is estimated to have stayed robust, but net issuance of corporate bonds 
was somewhat soft and commercial paper outstanding contracted (Chart 4).  
According to the July Senior Loan Offi cer Opinion Survey, banks further eased 
lending standards and some terms on C&I loans over the previous three months, 
largely in response to increased competit ion from other banks and nonbank lenders.  
The limited data in hand for the household sector suggest that debt growth was still 
brisk in the second quarter, though below the first quarter’s double-digit pace.  While 
cash-out refinancing activity remained str ong in the second quarter, applications for 
mortgages to purchase homes continued to wane, pointing to a modest decline in 
overall mortgage borrowing.  Consumer loan  growth through May remained subdued.  
In the federal sector, tax receipts were strong  in the second quarter, and Treasury debt 
outstanding contracted slightly.  State an d local governments stepped up borrowing.  
Overall, the expansion of do mestic nonfinancial sector debt is estimated to have 
slowed last quarter to an annual  rate of just under 7 percent. 
(9) M2 growth averaged 5¼ percent in June  and July, somewhat stronger than 
projected at the time of the last FOMC me eting but still consis tent with moderate 
nominal income growth and high opportuni ty cost.  Retail money funds and small 
time deposits, whose yields tend to rise ab out in line with short-term market interest 
rates, expanded rapidly over the two mont hs.  By contrast, liquid deposits, whose 
yields typically rise much more slowly than market rates, continued to run off.  
Currency growth was negative in June and July .  Available data indicate that domestic 
demand for currency was likely about av erage while international demand was 
unusually weak.

Economic Outlook 
(10) In the staff outlook, the forecasts for aggregate demand and potential 
output have both been revised down, leaving expected pressures on resource 
utilization about as projected in the Ju ne Greenbook.  Nonetheless, the outlook for 
inflation has deteriorated somewhat, reflec ting incoming consumer price data and 
higher energy prices.  In the forecast, a federal funds rate of 5¼ percent over the 
remainder of this year and next—the same path as was assumed in June—engenders 
subdued GDP growth and core inflation th at edges down slowly from its recent 
elevated level.  Long-term Treasury yiel ds are about unchanged through the end of 
next year.  Stock prices are again assumed to  rise at about a 6½ percent annual rate, 
but from a level that is a so mewhat higher than in June, while the foreign exchange 
value of the dollar is assumed to depreciate at a 2½ percent annual rate against an 
index of major foreign currencies.  After risi ng sharply over the period since the June 
Greenbook was completed, oil prices are a ssumed to remain about flat through 2007, 
consistent with quotes in futures markets.  Against this backdrop, and with incoming 
data confirming that aggregate demand mode rated considerably in the second quarter, 
the staff projects that real GDP will increa se at an average annual rate of about 
2¼ percent over the second half of this year and 2007.  With output expanding more 
slowly than the staff’s estimate of potenti al GDP growth (which has been revised 
down from 3.2 percent to 2.9 percent in li ght of the annual revision to the National 
Income and Product Accounts), the unemploy ment rate rises steadily, reaching 5¼ 
percent by the end of 2007 as it did in the June Greenbook.  As the pass-through of 
increases in energy prices ebbs and pressure s on resources ease, core  inflation declines 
gradually over the projection period.  Noneth eless, core PCE inflation is expected to 
average 2½ percent this year and 2¼ perc ent in 2007, slightly above the June 
projection for both years.  The staff’s forecast  for inflation is broadly in line with the 
central tendency of the FOMC participants’ pr ojections compiled fo r the last meeting, 
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)

but its forecast for the unemployment rate is notably higher, as was the case in June.  
The central tendency for real GDP growth , which was compiled before the annual 
revision to the National Income and Produc t Accounts, was higher than either the 
June or the current staff forecast.3   
Short-Run Policy Alternatives 
(11) This Bluebook presents four poli cy alternatives for the Committee’s 
consideration, summarized by the draft statem ents in Table 1.  Under Alternatives A 
and B, the Committee would leave the federal funds rate unchanged at this meeting, 
while under Alternatives C and D it would tighten policy another 25 basis points.  In 
Alternatives B and D, the accompanying statement would indicate that risks to 
inflation remain to the upside and signal that additional tightening might still be 
forthcoming, depending on incoming informat ion.  In contrast, Alternatives A and C 
would imply that the tightening cycle may we ll have come to a close.  For reference, 
the June statement is included on the page following Table 1. 
(12) Although recent rates of inflation, if sustained, would presumably be judged 
inconsistent with the maintenance of price stability, the Committee might see the 
current stance of policy as likely to be su fficient to put core inflation on a downward 
track.  If so, it might be inclined to keep the federal funds rate unchange d at            
5¼ percent at this meeting while indicati ng in the statement that some additional 
firming might prove necessary, as in Alternative B .  The Committee may agree with 
the staff assessment that core inflation is li kely to decline gradually in coming quarters 
as the forces that have temporarily boosted inflation begin to unwind and the 
moderation in economic growth fosters an ea sing of resource pressures.  Maintaining 
                                           
3 The central tendency for core PCE inflation was 2¼ to 2½ percent for 2006 and 2 to 2¼ 
percent for 2007.  For real GDP growth it was 3¼ to 3½ percent for 2006 and 3 to 3¼ 
percent for 2007, while for the rate of unemploy ment in the fourth quarter it was 4¾ to 5 
percent for both years.

Rationale 3.  Readings on core inflation have 
been elevated in recent months , 
owing in part to pass-through of increased energy and other 
commodity prices.  However, 
inflation pressures seem likely to 
moderate over time, reflecting  the 
cumulative effects of monetary policy actions and other factors 
restraining aggregate demand,  
ongoing productivity gains, and contained inflation expectations. Readings on core inflation have been 
elevated in recent months, owing in part 
to the pass-through of increased energy and other commodity prices.  However, 
inflation pressures seem likely to 
moderate over time, reflecting  contained 
inflation expectations and the cumulative 
effects of monetary policy actions and 
other factors restraining aggregate 
demand.  Readings on core inflation have been 
elevated in recent months , and the high 
levels of resource utilization and of the 
prices of energy and other commodities 
have the potential to sustain inflation 
pressures.  However, inflation pressures 
seem likely to moderate over time, 
reflecting  contained inflation 
expectations and the cumulative effects

The moderation in the growth of

contain inflation in coming quarters. 
However, the high levels of resource

the potential to sustain inflation 
pressures.   
4.  In these circumstances, future 
policy adjustments  will depend on 
the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic 
growth, as implied by incoming 
information. Although the Committee expects 
inflation pressures to diminish gradually, 
it judges that some inflation risks remain.  
The extent and timing of any additional

these risks will depend on the evolution 
of the outlook for both inflation and

June FOMC Statement 
 
1.  The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to raise its target for 
the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 5-1/4 percent. 
 
2.  Recent indicators suggest that economic  growth is moderating from its quite 
strong pace earlier this year, partly reflecting a gradual cooling of the housing 
market and the lagged effects of increases in interest rates and energy prices. 
 
3.  Readings on core inflation have b een elevated in re cent months. Ongoing 
productivity gains have held down the rise in unit labor costs, and inflation 
expectations remain contained. However, the high levels of resource utilization 
and of the prices of energy and other co mmodities have the potential to sustain 
inflation pressures. 
 
4.  Although the moderation in the grow th of aggregate demand should help to 
limit inflation pressures over time, the Committee judges that some inflation 
risks remain. The extent and timing of  any additional firming that may be 
needed to address these risks will depe nd on the evolution of the outlook for 
both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information. 
 5.  In any event, the Committee will re spond to changes in economic prospects 
as needed to support the attainment of its objectives.

the current policy stance would be consistent  with prescriptions from the estimated 
forecast-based policy rule (Chart 5) as well as the first-difference rule with a long-run 
inflation objective of 2 percent (Chart 6).  (See the box “Intercept Shifts in Empirical 
Taylor Rules.”)  A pause at this meeting, after seventeen consecutive actions, might be 
seen as desirable in order to limit the risk of over-tightening and the adverse 
consequences for employment and growth.  With the real federal funds rate in the 
range of model-based estimates of its equi librium value (Chart 8), the risk that 
deferring action for a brief time might sign ificantly worsen underlying inflationary 
trends would seem to be modest.  Noneth eless, the Committee may feel that elevated 
energy  and commodity prices, possible furt her increases in these prices, and high 
levels of resource utilization imply that the upside risks to inflation remain substantial 
and perceive only limited downside risks to the economic expansion, and so see 
Intercept Shifts in Empirical Policy Rules 
 
Chart 5 shows the projections of two empirical policy rules—specified in terms of 
either outcomes or forecasts of the output  gap and core inflation—that have been 
estimated using quarterly data from 1988Q 1 to 2005Q4.  In previous Bluebooks,  
both of these rules involved a time-invariant  intercept, essentially implying that  
the medium-run equilibrium real rate ( r*) and the implicit inflation objective ( π*) 
remained constant throughout the sample pe riod.  However, recent staff analysis 
indicates that a significant upward shift in the intercept of each empirical rule occurred in the late 1990s.  Such a shift could arise from either a 75 basis point  
rise in r*, a 1 percentage point decline in 
π*, or some combination of the two.   
The funds rate projections and confidence intervals shown in Chart 5 incorporate 
these intercept shifts.  The projections ge nerated by the forecast-based rule are 
broadly similar to the expectations of mar ket participants, while the outcome-based 
rule points to some additional firming.    Reflecting the possibility of an upward shift in the value of r*, this Bluebook 
introduces an additional simple policy rule in Chart 6.  For each specified value  
of 
π* (either 1½ or 2 percent), the new rule follows Taylor (1999) with respect  
to the policy coefficients—which determine the responsiveness of the funds rate  
to movements in the output gap and core  inflation—but specifies the value of r*  
at 2.75 percent instead of 2 percent.

Policy Rule Charts: Explanatory Notes  
   
For the rules described below, it denotes the federal funds rate for quarter t, while the explanatory 
variables include the staff’s estimate of tr ailing four-quarter co re PCE inflation ( πt), its forecasts  
of inflation two and three quarters ahead ( πt+2|t and πt+3|t), its assessment of the current output gap 
(*
ttyy− ), its one-quarter-ahead forecast of the output gap (*
1| 1|tt ttyy+ +− ), its three-quarter-ahead 
forecast of annual average GDP growth relative to potential (44*
3| 3|tt ttyy+ + Δ− Δ ), and the assumed value 
of policymakers’ long-run inflation objective (*π).    
Rule prescriptions are computed using dynamic simu lations of the FRB/US model, implemented as 
though the rule is followed starting at this FOMC m eeting.  This quarter’s prescription is a weighted 
average of the actual value of the federal funds rate thus far this quarter and the value obtained from the 
FRB/US model simulations using the tim ing of this meeting within the quarter to determine the weights.  
Except for backward-looking rules, it should be noted that prescriptions near the end of the Greenbook 
horizon also depend on extended baselines. 
  
Estimated Rules :  Estimation is performed using real-tim e data over the sample 1988:1-2005:4, and the 
specifications are chosen according to the Bayesian in formation criterion.  Each rule incorporates a 75 
basis point shift in the intercept, specified as a sequence of 25 basis point in crements that occurred 
during the first three quarters of  1998. Confidence intervals, shown onl y for the outcome-based rule, are 
based on stochastic simulations of the FRB/US model.  The following table indicates the specification of 
each rule used for dynamic simulations and its root  mean squared error over the sample 1993:1-2005:4.

Optimal-Control Policies :  Policymakers are assumed to minimize the weighted sum of squared 
deviations in inflation from the long-run objective, squared deviati ons in the unemployment from its 
natural rate, and squared changes in the federal funds rate.  Financial ma rket participants are assumed to 
understand fully the model of the economy, the baseline economic projection, and the policy 
formulation process, implying mode l-consistent asset-price responses to policymaker actions.  In 
contrast, households and firms are assumed to form their expectations using more limited information.

Equilibrium Real Rate Chart: Explanatory Notes  
The equilibrium real rate is the real federal funds rate that , if maintained, would be projected to return output to its 
potential level over time.  For the first three measures listed below, the short-run equilibri um rate is defined as the 
rate that would close the output gap in twelve qua rters given the corresponding model’s projection of the 
economy.  For the first two measures, the medium-run concept is the value of the real federal funds rate projected 
to keep output at potential in seven years under the assumption that monetary policy acts to bring actual and 
potential output into line in the short run and then keeps them equal thereafter.  The TIPS-based factor model 
measure provides an estimate of market expectations for th e real federal funds rate seven years ahead.  The actual 
real federal funds rate is constructe d as the difference between the nominal ra te and realized inflation, where the 
nominal rate is measured as the quarterly average of th e observed federal funds rate, and realized inflation is 
given by the log difference between the staff’s estimate of the core PCE price index and its lagged value four 
quarters earlier.  For the current quarter, the nominal rate  is specified as the target federal funds rate on the 
Bluebook publication date.   
Measure Description 
Single-equation 
Model   The measure of the equilibrium real rate in the single-equation model is based on an 
estimated aggregate-demand relationship between  the current value of the output gap and 
its lagged values as well as the lagged values of the real federal funds rate.  In light of this 
model’s simple structure, the short-run measur e of the equilibrium real rate depends only 
on the recent position of output relative to potential, and the medium-run measure is virtually constant.
 
Small Structural 
Model  The small-scale model of the economy consists of equations for five variables: the output 
gap, the equity premium, the federal budget surp lus, the trend growth rate of output, and 
the real bond yield.  Unlike the estimates from the single-equation model, values of the equilibrium real rate also depend directly  on conditions associated with output growth, 
fiscal policy, and capital markets.
 
Large Model 
(FRB/US)  Estimates of the equilibrium real rate using FRB/US—the staff’s large-scale econometric 
model of the U.S. economy—depend on a very broad array of economic factors, some of 
which take the form of projected values of the model’s exogenous variables.  These projections make use of several simple fo recasting rules which are appropriate for the 
three-year horizon relevant for the short-r un concept but are less sensible over longer 
horizons.  Thus, we report only the shor t-run measure for the FRB/US model.
 
Greenbook-
consistent  Measures of the equilibrium real rate cannot  be directly obtained from the Greenbook 
forecast, because the Greenbook is not based on a formal model.  Rather, we use the 
FRB/US model in conjunction with an extended version of the Greenbook forecast to 
derive a Greenbook-consistent measure.  FRB/ US is first add-factored so that its 
simulation matches the extended Greenbook forecast, and then a second simulation is run 
off this baseline to determine the value of the real federal funds rate that closes the output 
gap.  The medium-run concept of the equilibrium real rate is not computed because it 
requires a relatively long extension of the Greenbook forecast.  
TIPS-based 
Factor Model Yields on TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) reflect investors’ expectations of 
the future path of real interest rates, but also include term and liquidity premiums.  The 
TIPS-based measure of the equilibrium real ra te is constructed using the seven-year-ahead 
instantaneous real forward rate derived fro m TIPS yields as of the Bluebook publication 
date.  This forward rate is adjusted to remove estimates of the term and liquidity 
premiums based on a three-factor arbitrage -free term-structure model applied to TIPS 
yields, nominal yields, and inflation.  Because TIPS indexation is based on the total CPI, 
this measure is also adjusted for the me dium-term difference—projected at 40 basis 
points—between total CPI inflation and core PCE inflation.

additional firming as more likely than easi ng in coming months.  The Committee may 
find communicating this posture particular ly important if it were concerned that 
inaction at this meeting might lead investors to  question its vigilance against inflation.   
(13) Under Alternative B, the rationale paragraph in the statement would 
indicate that economic growth has moderated,  noting the role of the lagged effects of 
increases in interest rates and energy pric es and of the continuing cooling of the 
housing market.  While acknowledging the el evated readings on core inflation, it 
would also cite the reasons to expect in flation to decline in coming quarters: 
contained inflation expectations, the cumula tive effects of past policy firmings, and 
other factors restraining aggregate demand.  In its assessment of risks, the Committee 
would reiterate its judgment that some upsi de inflation risks remain and point to the 
possibility of additional firm ing should incoming information warrant such action. 
(14) Investors see about a one-third chance of a policy firming at this meeting 
and appear to anticipate a statement similar to that under Alternative B.  As a result, 
the market reaction to implementation of this al ternative would likely be fairly small.  
While short-term interest rates would decl ine somewhat, intermediate- and long-term 
rates, stock prices, and the foreign exch ange value of the dollar probably would 
change little.   
(15) If the Committee judges that the risks to the attainment of its objectives are 
now roughly in balance, it may be attr acted to the policy choice and wording of 
Alternative A .  The Committee may see greater do wnside risks to economic growth 
than it did in June.  Among other deve lopments, the incoming information on the 
housing sector may be viewed as suggesting the possibility of a more prolonged and 
sizable reduction in residential construction and spending than is currently anticipated 
by the staff, along the lines of the “housi ng slump” alternative Greenbook scenario.  
The incoming data pointing to a slowing in economic grow th may also have increased 
the Committee’s confidence that the recent elev ated inflation readings are unlikely to 
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)
Page 21 of 39
be sustained.  Keeping the federal funds ra te at 5¼ percent for some time would be 
roughly consistent with an optimal poli cy path suggested by a simulation of the 
FRB/US model with a long-run inflation objective of 2 percent (Chart 7).   
(16) The rationale presented for Alternative A in the post-meeting statement 
could be similar to that for Alternative B, since both alternatives would keep the 
federal funds rate unchanged at this meetin g.  However, the assessment of risks could 
simply point to the dependence of future policy adjustments on incoming 
information.  Against the backdrop of its st atements over the previous two years, in 
which the Committee either provided explic it rate guidance or pointed to upside 
inflation risks, such an announcement would li kely suggest to market participants that 
the Committee was not predisposed  to raising rates or lowe ring them going forward. 
(17) As in Alternative B, shorter-term intere st rates would fall a little in response 
to an announcement along the lines of Alte rnative A.  However, longer-term yields 
might edge higher if market participants became concerned that the Committee was 
underestimating inflation risks or was willin g to tolerate somewhat higher rates of 
inflation going forward than earlier anticipated.  
(18) The Committee may judge instead that an additional 25 basis point increase 
in the federal funds rate at this meeting, as in Alternative C , is needed to bring the 
risks to the outlook for inflat ion and economic growth into better balance.  A firming 
at this meeting might be appropriate if the st aff’s inflation forecast were seen as likely 
and generally acceptable but the Committee wished to have slightly greater assurance 
that inflation would diminish in coming qu arters.  Members might worry that inflation 
pressures could turn out to be a little gr eater than projected in the Greenbook.  The 
economy has proved quite resilient in the face of higher oil prices and tighter 
monetary policy over the past two years, and members may see economic growth as most likely to rebound from its sharply slow er pace in the second quarter.  In light of 
the recent upside surprises in price data, rais ing the federal funds ra te at this meeting 
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)
Page 22 of 39
might also seem desirable as a signal of th e Committee’s resolve to foster a decline in 
inflation.  Even with the firming action under this alternative, the Committee may 
judge that significant upside risks to infl ation remain.  However, some members may 
see the slowing in the expansion of aggregate demand of late as suggesting that the 
downside risks to growth have increased since the last meetin g.  The Committee 
might see Alternative C as bringing the risks to the attainment of its growth and price 
stability objectives roughly in balance and believe that, after implementation of such a 
policy choice, an easing and a tightening  of policy are about equally probable. 
(19) Under Alternative C, the paragraph on economic activity in the rationale 
section could be identical to that proposed for Alternatives A and B.  The 
announcement could then acknowledge the el evated readings on core inflation and 
cite the potential for high levels of resource  utilization and of the prices of energy and 
other commodities to sustain inflation pressu res, but it could also point to the factors 
likely to reduce inflation over coming quarter s.  In the risk assessment sentence of the 
announcement, the Committee could merely po int to the dependence of future policy 
adjustments on incoming information, as  in the assessment proposed for    
Alternative A.  Market participants woul d likely interpret such an announcement as 
suggesting that the Committee no longer had a significant inclination to continue 
firming policy.   
(20) With market participants placing less than fifty-fifty odds on a policy move 
at this meeting, short-term interest rates would likely jump in response to 
implementation of Alternative C.  However, the effect on intermediate-term interest 
rates would be considerably more muted, and long-term rates could even decline a 
little should the announcement persuade inve stors that inflation pressures were less 
intense than they had appreciated or that the Committee was seeking a slightly lower 
long-term rate of inflation than they had pr eviously perceived.  Despite the rise in 
short-term interest rates, with policy tighte ning evidently having drawn to a close, 
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)
Page 23 of 39
equity prices might rally.  The foreign ex change value of the dollar might be little 
affected.   
(21) If members were dissatisfied with the gradual and limited reduction in 
inflation in the staff forecast and favored a trajectory of policy that would foster a 
steeper decline, they might wish to  adopt the action and language of Alternative D.   
The optimal policy path simulations of th e FRB/US model (Chart 7) and the first-
difference rule (Chart 6), with a long-term inflation objective equal to 1½ percent,  
would both call for additional firming of  policy even following a 25 basis point 
tightening at the August meeting.  Th e Committee may also find Alternative D 
attractive if it deems the outlook for empl oyment and growth to be more favorable 
than the staff projection.  Moreover, memb ers may be concerned that the staff has 
underestimated the persistence of the forc es that have boosted inflation, possible 
consequences of which are illustrated by  the “persistent inflation” alternative 
Greenbook scenario.  Indeed, the optimal polic y path suggested by a simulation of the 
FRB/US model under perfect foresight in th is scenario would call for considerable 
additional policy firming in coming months .  However, the policy response would be 
tempered in the more realistic circumstance that the persistence of the inflationary 
forces became clear only gradually over time (see box on next page).  Even if the Committee saw the staff inflation forecast as  the most likely outcome, and one that 
would be satisfactory, it might find this alternative appealing if it were persuaded by 
recent price data that the upside risks to in flation, and the potential costs should these 
risks be realized, continued to predomin ate despite an additional 25 basis points 
increase in the federal funds rate at this meeting.  The potential for further increases 
in energy prices, for example as a result of  mounting geopolitical tensions, could be a 
reason for such worries.   (22) While acknowledging the moderation in  economic growth and other forces 
that are expected to contain inflation in  coming quarters, the rationale paragraph 
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)
Page 24 of 39
 
Persistent Inflation:  Implications  of Alternative Policy Assumptions 
The policy path implied by a simple rule—s uch as the empirical outcome-based rule 
shown in Chart 5 and used in analyzing the alternative scenarios in the Greenbook—
often differs from the optimal policy when policymakers fully understand the forces 
affecting the real economy and inflation, but may well yield prescriptions close to 
those under the optimal policy when these forces become evident only gradually.   
For example, the chart below compares thes e alternative policy assumptions in the 
context of the Greenbook’s ‘Persistent Inflati on’ scenario, in which the recent rise  
in core inflation is much more persistent than in the staff’s current projection.  The 
solid lines depict the optimal policy an d associated macroeconomic outcomes (as 
deviations from baseline) when policymakers have perfect foresight  about the persistence 
of the inflation pressures and place equal weight on the objectives of stabilizing 
inflation, stabilizing unemployment, and avoidi ng sharp funds rate changes.  In this 
case, the optimal policy involves  a 75 basis point funds rate hike by the end of 2006.  
In contrast, if the persistence of the shock does not become apparent until mid-2007, 
the optimal policy with gradual learning  (dashed lines) generates a funds rate trajectory 
over the next six quarters that lies betwee n the path obtained under perfect foresight 
and the path associated with the empirical outcome-based rule  (dotted lines), in which 
policy responds to contemporaneous four- quarter average core inflation and to 
contemporaneous and lagged output gaps.  All three policy paths generate fairly 
similar trajectories for inflation, reflecting th e relatively sluggish inflation dynamics  
in the FRB/US model.

under Alternative D could emphasize that seve ral factors have the potential to sustain 
inflation pressures.  The risk assessment could be similar to the Committee’s 
statement in June, indicating that additiona l firming may be needed, but reference an 
intention to foster a moderation in inflation pressures.  
(23) The policy choice and announcement of Alternative D would come as a 
considerable surprise to market participants and lead to an upward revision of their 
outlook for the path of policy.  Short- and intermediate-term interest rates would 
climb significantly.  Longer-t erm rates probably would also rise, especially if investors 
read the statement as suggesting that they should be more concerned about inflation 
prospects, but the increase would be limited if market participants also revised 
downward their perceptions of the Committee ’s long-term inflation objective.  Equity 
prices would likely fall, while the foreign exchange value of the dollar might rise.  
Money and Debt Forecasts 
(24) Under the Greenbook forecast, M2 is expe cted to grow about 4 percent in 
2006, reflecting the restraining effects of pa st policy tightenings and rising opportunity 
costs, and the velocity of M2 is forecast to increase about 2 percent.  With short-term 
interest rates unchanged, however, opportunity cost is forecast to level out in coming 
months and subsequently declin e a little. Consequently, M2 gr owth is expected to pick 
up in coming quarters and, in 2007, to a bout match the growth in nominal income of 
approximately 4¾ percent.  Debt growth of the domestic nonfinancial sector is 
projected to drop from 9½ percent last year  to 8¼ percent in 2006 and to 6½ percent 
in 2007.  Federal debt growth, which was depressed by unexpectedly strong tax 
receipts this spring, is expected to pick up  over the forecast horizon. However, with 
the expected further decelerat ion in house prices, mortgage  borrowing is projected to 
slow considerably from its recent strong pace.

Directive and Balance of  Risks Statement 
(25) Draft language for the directive and draf t risk assessments identical to those 
presented in Table 1 are provided below. 
Directive Wording 
The Federal Open Market Committ ee seeks monetary and financial 
conditions that will foster price st ability and promote sustainable growth 
in output.  To further its long-r un objectives, the Committee in the 
immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with 
MAINTAINING/increasing/REDUCING the federal funds rate 
AT/to an average of around ________________ 5¼  percent. 
Risk Assessments  
A. In these circumstances, future polic y adjustments will depend on the 
evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as 
implied by incoming information. 
B. Although the Committee expects in flation pressures to diminish 
gradually, it judges that some infl ation risks remain.  The extent and 
timing of any additional firming th at may be needed to address these 
risks will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and 
economic growth, as implied by incoming information. 
C. Same as A. 
D. The extent and timing of any additi onal firming that may be needed to 
foster a moderation in inflation pre ssures will depend on the evolution 
of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by 
incoming information.

Inflation Indicator Based on M2
Note: P* is defined to equal M2 times V* divided by potential GDP. V*, or long-run velocity, is estimated
using average velocity over the 1959:Q1-to-1989:Q4 period and then, after a break, over the interval from
1993:Q1 to the present. For the forecast period, P* is based on the staff M2 forecast and P is simulated using a
