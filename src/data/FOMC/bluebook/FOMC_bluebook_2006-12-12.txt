MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES  
Recent Developments 
(1) Neither the FOMC’s decision at the Octo ber meeting to keep its target for 
the federal funds rate at 5¼ percent nor its policy statement surprised market 
participants.1  As a result, the market reaction to the announcement was muted, as 
was the response to the subsequent publicati on of the minutes of the meeting.  Over 
the intermeeting period, investors continued to anticipate that the FOMC will leave 
policy unchanged at this meeting.  Howeve r, partly in response to several weaker-
than-expected economic data releases, they bu ilt in some odds of an easing at the 
January meeting and significantly lowered their expectations for the path of policy 
further ahead.  Futures quotes indicate that  market participants now expect more than 
75 basis points of easing during 2007, al most 50 basis points more than they 
anticipated before the October meeting (Chart  1).  However, on average, respondents 
to the Desk’s survey of primary dealers ex pect somewhat less policy easing in 2007—
about 50 basis points.  The primary dealers generally also anticipate the December 
FOMC statement to be broadly similar to th at in October.  Although some dealers 
think that the Committee will allude to some softening in the economic outlook, most 
believe that the Committee will continue to  emphasize inflation risks.  According to 
options prices, market participants’ uncertainty about the near-term path of monetary 
                                           
1 The effective federal funds rate averaged 5.25 percent over the intermeeting period.  
During the period, the Desk purchased $6.2 billion of Treasury coupon securities in the 
market and redeemed $335 million of coupon securities.  The volume of outstanding long-
term RPs increased by $4 billion, to $19 bil lion, primarily to accommo date seasonal increases 
in currency.  The changes to th e guidelines for per-issue hold ing limits by the System Open 
Market Account that were discussed at th e October FOMC meeting were implemented 
uneventfully during th is intermeeting period.

policy increased somewhat over the intermeeting period—though it remained low by 
historical standards—and their outlook fo r the funds rate became more skewed 
toward lower outcomes.  
(2) Yields on Treasury securities also fell  notably over the intermeeting period.  
The yield curve shifted downward in a nearly parallel fashion, with yields on two- through ten-year nominal Treasury notes droppi ng about 35 basis points.   These rate 
declines apparently reflected, at least in  part, a less optimis tic economic outlook 
among investors.  Both expected future shor t-term interest rates and term premiums 
are estimated to have declined (see box on the next page).  After adjusting for carry 
effects, TIPS-based inflation compensation  for the next five years was essentially 
unchanged over the intermeeting period, and inflation compensation for the 
subsequent five years edged somewhat lowe r on balance.  According to the Michigan 
survey, households’ short- and long-term infl ation expectations moved down a bit.   
(3) Major stock price indexes rose between 2 and 3 percent, on net, over the 
intermeeting period (Chart 2).  The declin e in bond yields and the continued positive 
tone of the final batch of reports on third- quarter corporate earnings evidently offset 
the negative effects of the weaker macro economic news.  Implie d volatility of the 
S&P 500 rose somewhat, though it remained near historical lows, and a rough 
measure of the equity risk premium wi dened somewhat.  Spreads of yields on 
investment- and speculative-grade bonds over those on comparable-maturity 
Treasuries were about unchanged.  Measures of the credit quality of nonfinancial firms stayed solid, supported by robust earnings and by strong and liquid balance sheets. 
(4) The trade-weighted value of the dollar versus major foreign currencies fell 
2¾ percent on balance over th e intermeeting period, with a particularly steep slide in 
late November (Chart 3).  Although the drop did not appear to be triggered by 
specific events, it occurred in the cont ext of both weaker-than-expected U.S.

  Interpreting the Decline in Treasury Yields over the Intermeeting Period 
 
Nominal Treasury yields declined about 35 basis points over the intermeeting period, with the drop 
spread across the forward rate curve.  To put the size of this move into some historical perspective, the average absolute intermeeting change in two- an d ten-year Treasury yields since 1994 is 29 and 
27 basis points, respectively.  Judging from TIPS yi elds, the decline in near-term nominal rates over 
the intermeeting period has been mostly concentrated  in real yields.  Further out the term structure, 
a small portion of the decline in nominal forward rates owes to a modest decline in inflation 
compensation. Various estimates suggest that both expected future short-term interest rates and term premiums declined, with the latter reflecting, in particular, lower compensation for real interest rate risk.   This broad pattern was also evident, albeit somewhat less pronounced, in global bond markets as nominal and real rates moved lower in a number of industrialized countries.   
 
To a degree, the drop in yields seems to have been prompted by weaker-than-anticipated indicators of aggregate demand against the backdrop of relatively benign inflation data.  To be sure, the initial market reaction to recent spending data, as gauged by yield changes in narrow intervals around their 
releases, falls well short of explaining the full movement in yields.  However, market reports suggest that incoming information spurred a broader revision to investors’ views regarding the macroeconomic outlook.  Primary dealers, for exam ple, have lowered their forecasts of real GDP 
growth in the fourth quarter about ½ percentage po int, and to a lesser extent going forward, which 
is consistent with the fall in real interest rates, part icularly at the front end of the curve.  And some 
dealers have marked down their estimates of potential output growth, which might help to explain some of the decline in real rates at distant horizons.  
 
On balance, the drop in yields over the intermeet ing period seems to accord reasonably well with a 
sense that investors may perceive greater downside  risks in the outlook for spending and economic 
growth.  Nonetheless, some aspects of recent yiel d curve developments do not appear to fit so 
neatly with changes in economic fundamentals.  The sizable drop in estimated term premiums, for example, seems to run counter to the uptick in some measures of interest rate uncertainty. 
 
Market analysts have offered several other special stories for the drop in yields, but these explanations also are not compl etely satisfying.  For example, some analysts have focused on 
anecdotal reports of strong foreign demand for Tr easury securities.  However, available indicators 
do not point to a large increase in such demand.  Similarly, while some market participants have 
suggested that the recent declines in yields have been amplified by mortgage-related hedging flows, 
staff analysis indicates that the current level of ra tes would be expected to prompt only fairly modest 
hedging demands for longer-duration assets.  Fina lly, a few commentators have suggested that the 
outcome of the Congressional elections may have played a role in lowering longer-term interest rates, perhaps because investors expect federal bu dget deficits to be reduced.  Although yields 
declined modestly on the day after the election, little evidence can be adduced to support this 
hypothesis. 
 
In summary, while the direction of interest rates over the period seems consistent with changing 
perceptions of economic fundamentals, the ma gnitude of these changes remains somewhat 
surprising.

economic data and relatively strong economic indicators for Europe.  On balance, the 
dollar fell 5¼ percent against the euro, 4¼ percent versus sterling, and about 
3¼ percent against the yen.  By contrast, the dollar rose about 2 percent against the 
Canadian dollar, as data on Canadian economic activity were unexpectedly soft.  
Yields on long-term government securities in foreign industrial countries registered 
declines of 10 to 30 basis points, generall y somewhat less than those on comparable-
maturity U.S. Treasury issues.  Major fo reign stock markets recorded small net 
changes over the intermeeting period.  To combat inflation pressures, the Bank of 
England, the Riksbank, the Reserve Bank of Australia, and the European Central Bank raised their policy rates 25 basi s points during the intermeeting period.

(5) The dollar declined about 1¼ per cent on net against an index of currencies 
of our other important trading partners.   
 
  The dollar’s slow decline 
versus the Chinese renminbi accelerated a bit, leaving the dollar about 1 percent lower by the end of the intermeeting period.  De spite signs of continued strong Mexican 
economic performance, the peso weakened because of ongoing political turmoil 
surrounding the change in the Mexican pr esidency; on balance, the dollar gained 
about ¾ percent against the peso over the intermeeting period.  Stock prices in Mexico and Brazil climbed roughly 11 and 8 percent, respectively, and their EMBI+ 
spreads remained steady near low historical levels.

(6) The debt of the domestic nonfinancial sectors grew at about a 6¾ percent 
annual rate in the third quarter and appears to be expanding at nearly that pace in the 
current quarter (Chart 4).  Net issuance of investment- and speculative-grade 
corporate bonds surged in November, suppor ted by the continued elevated level of 
mergers and acquisitions and the decline in yields.  Short-term business borrowing, by 
contrast, appears to have moderated somewh at, with C&I loans slowing notably in the 
fourth quarter from their rapid pace earlier in the year.  Growth of home mortgage 
debt is estimated to have stepped down sign ificantly in the third quarter, about in line 
with the sustained deceleration in house pric es.  Consumer credit again expanded at a 
moderate pace in the third quarter, and data  for consumer loans at commercial banks 
suggest continued modest growth in the current quarter.       
(7) Reflecting the pattern of ex pansion in liquid deposits,  M2 growth jumped in 
October but fell back to a 6 percent annual ra te in November.  By contrast, small time 
deposits and retail money funds—two component s of the aggregate whose yields tend 
to follow short-term market rates fairly closely—continued to expand briskly.  For the 
fourth quarter as a whole, M2 growth ap pears to be outpacing that of nominal 
income, the first decrease in the velocity of M2 in more than two years.  Appendix A 
analyzes the growth of money and the debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors this year.

Economic Outlook Through 2008 
(8) The staff’s forecast for both real GDP  and inflation is largely unchanged 
from that presented in the October Greenbook.  The underlying pace of economic 
growth in the second half of this year is judged to be a touch weaker than had been 
anticipated; further out, however, the forecast for real activity is little different, with 
growth projected to pick up gradually during  2007 to a rate broadly in line with the 
staff’s estimate of sustainable output growth.  As in October, the forecast assumes 
that the Committee maintains the current st ance of policy through mid-2008 and then 
eases slightly.  Longer-term Treasury yiel ds start from a lower level than in the 
previous forecast, but rise almost 50 ba sis points over 2007 as investors come to 
realize that policy is unlikely to be eased next year.  Stock pric es climb at about a 
6½ percent annual rate from a starting poi nt that is around 4 percent higher than 
projected in the October Greenbook.  The real  trade-weighted dollar is again assumed 
to depreciate gradually, but from a leve l about 2 percent lower than assumed in 
October.  Oil prices edge somewhat higher  over the forecast horizon, in line with 
futures quotes.  Reflecting the unexpected drop in the unemployment rate earlier this 
autumn, the labor market is projected to be slightly tighter through 2007 than had 
been anticipated in October, but the higher level of the markup implied by the 
downward revision to compensation sugge sts that firms will largely absorb the 
increased cost pressures emanating from th e labor market.  Core PCE inflation is 
again projected to edge down to about 2 percent by the end of 2008, primarily 
reflecting a further waning of the effects of the earlier run-up in the prices of energy 
and imported goods and a fall in the rate of  increase of shelter costs.  Overall PCE 
inflation is expected to be about 2¾ percent in 2007 and 2 percent in 2008.

Update on Medium-Term Strategies 
(9) Charts 5 to 7 provide an update of th e materials on medium-term strategies 
that were presented in the October Blue book.  The Greenbook-consistent measure  
of the short-run equilibrium real federal funds rate ( r*)—the value that would close 
the output gap over the next twelve quarter s—remains at about 2¾ percent, reflecting 
the modest changes to the staff’s outlook for aggregate demand over the intermeeting 
period (Chart 5).  The actual real funds rate is just above the Greenbook-consistent 
measure and at the upper end of the range of model-based estimates of short-run r* .  
Optimal control simulations of the FRB/US  model prescribe policy paths that are 
virtually identical to those presente d in the October Bluebook (Chart 6).3  With an 
inflation goal of 2 percent, the optimal fu nds rate remains near 5¼ percent through 
2008; in contrast, with an inflation goal of 1½ percent, optimal policy prescribes a 
funds rate path that peaks at about 6 per cent late next year.  The estimated outcome-
based rule prescribes a nearly constant fu nds rate of about 5¼ percent through the 
end of 2008—a path that is substantially tighter than that embedded in financial 
market prices (Chart 7).  Options prices continue to suggest noticeably less 
uncertainty about the future course of policy among market participants than implied 
by FRB/US model simulations.  The near-ter m prescriptions of several simple rules—
such as those proposed by Taylor (1993, 1999)—have not changed significantly over 
the intermeeting period. 
 
 
                                           
3 The FRB/US model was employ ed—together with judgmental adjustments—to cons truct an illustrative extension of 
the Greenbook forecast beyond 2008 that served as a baselin e for these simulations.  This extension was based on the 
same medium-term assumptions that were described in the October Bluebook.  In the optimal control exercises, 
policymakers and participants in financ ial markets are assumed to  understand fully the fo rces shaping the economic 
outlook (as summarized by  the extended Greenbook projection), whereas hou seholds and firms form their expectations 
using more limited information.  The opt imal policies shown in Chart 6 assume th at policymakers place equal weights on 
three stabilization objectives: keeping core  PCE inflation close to a specified goal of either 1½ or 2 percent; keeping 
unemployment close to the long-run NAIRU of 5 percent; and avoiding sharp changes in the nominal funds rate.

Short-Run Policy Alternatives 
(10) This Bluebook presents three policy alternatives for the Committee’s 
consideration, associated with the draft stat ements in Table 1.  Under Alternatives A 
and B, the Committee would leave the stance of monetary policy unchanged at this 
meeting; Alternative A would imply that th e risks to economic growth and inflation 
were now judged to be broadly balanced, whereas Alternative B would again indicate 
that the risks to inflation remained of greatest concern.  Under Alternative C, the 
Committee would increase the target rate 25 basis points at this meeting and continue 
to emphasize the presence of upside risks to inflation.  The employment report for 
November will be published the day after this document is completed; a revised draft 
of Table 1 will be circulated if warranted by those data.   
(11) If the Committee views a combination of near-trend growth and a gradual 
ebbing of core inflation over the next tw o years as the best attainable outcome in 
current circumstances and continues to judge that the current stance of policy is 
broadly consistent with ac hieving such an outcome, it might be attracted to 
Alternative B .  With the real federal funds rate  at the upper end of the range of 
model-based estimates of its equilibrium value and a bit above the Greenbook-
consistent measure, policy might be viewed  as applying slight restraint on economic 
activity, helping to foster a reduction of in flation.  Some tentative signs suggest that 
core inflation may be starting to moderate , and incoming data suggest that near-term 
economic expansion may be a bit further belo w growth of potential output than had 
previously been anticipated.  Even so, the possibility that inflation might not slow as 
expected may remain the dominant concern fo r policy going forward.  The substantial 
uncertainty regarding the dynamics of infl ation implies a risk that recent rates of 
inflation might persist even if output grow s at only a moderate pace and energy prices 
are broadly unchanged.  Moreover, the current tightness of the labor market—
evidenced both by the low unemployment rate  in October and by widespread reports

resource utilization has the potential 
to sustain inflation pressures. 
 
Inflation pressures  seem likely to 
moderate over time, but the extent 
and speed of that moderation are uncertain.  In these circumstances, 
the Committee believed that an 
additional firming of policy was 
appropriate to foster the 
achievement of price stability.  
In these circumstances, future policy 
adjustments  will depend on the evolution 
of the outlook for both inflation and 
economic growth, as implied by 
incoming information.  
 
 
                     [Unchanged] Assessment of 
Risk 4.  Nonetheless, the Committee 
judges that some inflation risks 
remain.  The extent and timing of 
any additional firming that may be 
needed to address these risks will 
depend on the evolution of the 
outlook for both inflation and 
economic growth, as implied by 
incoming information.  Although the Committee both seeks 
and expects a gradual reduction in 
inflation, it continues to view the 
risks to that outcome as to the 
upside.  The extent and timing of 
any additional firming that may be needed to address these risks will 
depend on the evolution of the 
outlook for both inflation and 
economic growth, as implied by

of labor shortages for a range of occupations—might be seen as posing an upside risk 
to the Committee’s desired moderation in in flation.  Even if the likelihood of a 
deterioration in inflation performance relative  to expectations is not thought to be 
significantly greater than that of a corresponding deterioration in economic growth, 
the Committee might judge that an erosion in inflation outcomes would be more 
costly and thus view the upside risks to in flation as the greater concern for policy.   
(12) In light of the recent data and the revi sion to the staff’s projection for near-
term growth, the Committee may wish to make two changes to the discussion of 
economic growth in the policy statement a ccompanying Alternative B.  First, the 
extent of the decline in housing activity in recent quarters means that it may now be 
more appropriate to refer to the cooling of  the housing market as “substantial.”   
Second, the statement could acknowledge that  “the recent pace of growth appears to 
have been somewhat more subdued than  anticipated…”  Even so, the Committee 
could note that “the economy seems likely to  expand at a moderate pace on balance 
over coming quarters.”  The inclusion of  the phrase “on balance” allows for the 
possibility that measured GDP growth in the current and subsequent quarter may be 
notably below trend before rebounding ther eafter.  With the prospects for inflation 
largely unchanged, there appears to be lit tle reason to alter the inflation paragraph 
from that in the October statement.  Likewise, the statement could conclude by 
repeating the risk assessment from the previous statement.  
(13) An announcement along the lines of Al ternative B is unlikely to prompt a 
significant market reaction.  Money market fu tures and options indicate that investors 
assign essentially no probability to a chan ge in the target rate at the December 
meeting.  And the Desk’s survey indicates th at the majority of primary dealers expect 
that the accompanying statement will not  differ significantly from the October 
announcement apart from some modest updating of the paragraph characterizing 
economic growth, though a minority anticipate language that points to some 
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)
Page 17 of 40
downside risks to the growth outlook while still citing upside risks to inflation.  
Although the statement proposed for Alternat ive B does not explic itly recognize risks 
to growth, it seems consistent with th e broad thrust of these expectations. 
(14)  If the data released over the interm eeting period have caused members to 
revise their assessment of the distributi on of possible outcomes for inflation and 
economic growth such that the risks are now thought to be more balanced, the 
Committee may prefer the policy choice and wording of Alternative A .  The sharper 
adjustment in residential investment implied by the incoming data, combined with the 
continuing high level of inventories in the auto sector and the softer tone of recent 
spending and production indicators more generally, might be seen as increasing the 
downside risks to economic growth.  Members may also see some possibility that the 
recent easing of financial conditions, and th e associated stimulus to economic growth, 
could be short lived, as illustrated in th e “Tighter financial conditions” scenario 
presented in the Greenbook.  Moreover, the st aff’s projection of relatively sluggish 
near-term expansion might cause the Committee to worry that such downside risks, if 
they materialized, could lead to a disproporti onate slowdown in growth.  At the same 
time, the Committee’s confidence that core  inflation will decline may have been 
boosted by the improvement in some measur es of core inflation, the downward 
revisions to data on increases in hourly comp ensation and unit labor costs earlier this 
year, and the absence so far of substantial renewed upward pressure on oil prices.  
The Committee may also place some weight  on the possibility that inflation could 
slow more quickly than in the staff forecast , either because the general persistence of 
inflation may have declined over the past d ecade or because the recent pickup in core 
inflation was associated importantly with in creases in shelter costs, which might fall 
back relatively sharply if the ongoing ad justment of the housing market leads to a 
marked increase in the supply of rental accommodation.  Finally, as noted earlier, 
maintaining the federal funds rate at 5¼ pe rcent over the next few quarters would be 
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)
Page 18 of 40
broadly consistent with the Committee’s past  behavior as captured in the estimated 
policy rules. 
(15) To acknowledge the downside risks to growth, the statement accompanying 
Alternative A would note that the ongoing  adjustment of the housing market could 
have a “more pronounced effect on growth in coming quarters than anticipated.”  
The Committee may also wish to recognize the slight decline in some measures of 
core inflation in recent months by notin g that “Readings on core inflation have 
improved modestly since the spring.”  Even so, the statement would stress that 
readings on core inflation “remain elevated .”  Given the competing risks to inflation 
and growth, the risk assessment would si mply note that “In these circumstances, 
future policy adjustments will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both 
inflation and economic growth, as impl ied by incoming information.”   
(16) Although market participants expect th e current target for the federal funds 
rate to be maintained at this meeting, th ey generally do not expect a statement that 
suggests that the Committee views the risks to economic growth and inflation as 
balanced and is no longer pred isposed towards policy firming.  Market participants are 
likely to interpret such a statement as boos ting the likelihood that the Committee will 
begin easing the stance of policy early next year.  Short- and intermediate-term yields 
would probably decline moderately, but any drop in long-term yields would likely be 
relatively small.  The recent slide in the foreign exchange value of the dollar could be 
extended, and stock prices might rally.     
(17) In contrast, the Committee may now see it as unlikely that inflation will 
decline at an acceptable pace should the cu rrent stance of policy be maintained and 
hence judge it necessary to take further poli cy action, as in the 25 basis point firming 
of Alternative C .  In particular, members may belie ve that the tightness in labor 
markets means that inflation may fail to dec line, and could even rise, as illustrated in 
the “Greater wage acceleration” scenario presented in the Greenbook.  In addition, 
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)
Page 19 of 40
the recent easing of financial conditions could impart significant stimulus to aggregate 
demand, augmenting pressure on resource s.  Also, some members may judge that 
long-term inflation expectations are high er than would be consistent with an 
appreciable decline in inflation from recen t rates and that monetary policy needs to 
tighten to help foster a reduction in these expectations.  Even if members think that 
the staff’s forecast for core inflation to edge gradually lower is reasonable, they may 
consider the extent and pace of that expected  decline, in which core PCE inflation is 
projected to remain above 2 percent through 2008, to be unacceptable, and hence see further policy firming as necessary.  In the medium-term strategies presented earlier, the optimal policy path associated with an inflation objective of 1½ percent involves 
raising the federal funds rate to about 6 percent over the next year.   
(18) The description of the prospects for growth in the statement associated 
with Alternative C could be identical to that  suggested for Alternative B.  However, in 
the inflation paragraph, rather than listing  the various factors contributing to the 
expected moderation in inflation, the Committee could indicate that “Inflation 
pressures seem likely to moderate over time, but the extent and speed of that 
moderation are uncertain.”  The discussion of  inflation could conclude by stating that 
“In these circumstances, the Committee believe d that an additional firming of policy 
was appropriate to foster the achievement of price stability.”  And if, despite the 
firming in policy, the Committee remaine d concerned that inflation would not 
moderate as desired, it could underscore its commitment to price stability by 
modifying the first sentence of the risk  assessment to note that “Although the 
Committee both seeks and expects a gradual re duction in inflation, it continues to 
view the risks to that ou tcome as to the upside.” 
(19) The firming of the stance of policy envisaged under Alternative C and the 
accompanying statement would come as a considerable surprise to the markets.  
Investors would likely revise up  sharply their expectations for the path of policy over 
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)
Page 20 of 40
the next year or so.  Short- and intermedia te-term nominal and real yields would rise 
markedly.  Longer-term nominal yields would likely rise by less or could even fall if 
investors concluded that the FOMC had a lo wer objective for inflation than they had 
previously thought.  With real rates high er, the foreign exchange value of the dollar 
would likely rise, and equity prices would decline.    
Money and Debt Forecasts 
(20) Under the Greenbook forecast, M2 is proj ected to grow about 5 percent in 
both 2007 and 2008, largely unchanged from the October forecast.  Given the flat path assumed for the federal funds rate, the restraining effects on money demand of 
previous policy tightenings will probably have run their co urse by early 2007.  As a 
result, M2 is projected to rise broadly in line with nominal income.  Liquid deposits—
the largest share of M2—are expected to ac celerate gradually as deposit rates on these 
assets continue to catch up  with the earlier increases in market rates.  Small time 
deposits and retail money funds,  which have been growing ra pidly because their yields 
follow market rates closely, are forecast to decelerate noticeably.  Currency is 
projected to continue to expand moderately. 
(21) Growth of domestic nonfinancial sector debt is expected to slow to an 
annual rate of around 6½ percent in 2007 and 2008, down  from about 7½ percent in 
2006.  This deceleration largely reflects a marked step-down in the growth of home 
mortgage debt, mirroring the ongoing adjust ment in the housing market.  The growth 
of business debt is also expected to ease slightly, owing to some slowing in net equity 
retirements.  Federal debt is projected to expand at a 6 percent pace over the next two 
years.

Appendix A: Review of Debt and Money Growth in 2006 
Total debt of the domestic nonfinancial sectors expanded an estimated 
7½ percent in 2006, below its pace in 20 05, but faster than nominal income.  
Debt growth slowed markedly in the household and government sectors, while 
business debt expanded faster than in 2005.   
The slowdown in household borrowing in 2006 was accounted for by a 
decline in home mortgage borrowing, refl ecting a substantial cooling in the 
housing market.  Meanwhile, strong tax receipts held down borrowing by the 
federal government, and continued improvement in the fiscal situation of state 
and local governments, as well as a drop in advance refunding issues, helped to 
reduce borrowing in that sector.   
Nonfinancial business borrowing pick ed up to finance greater capital 
spending, inventory investment, and equi ty retirements from share repurchases 
and mergers and acquisitions.  Net bond issuance in 2006 was quite a bit 
stronger than in the previous several years, while commercial paper outstanding 
and C&I loans also expanded at a faster  pace.  Business borrowing decelerated 
slightly in the second half of the year but remained robust on the whole.  
Leverage of nonfinancial businesses sta yed near the lows of the past two 
decades, with profits strong and balance sheets liquid.  
M2 grew about 5 percent this year, a slight pickup from 2005.  Money 
growth again was restrained relative to nominal income by the increase in 
opportunity costs associated with the tightening of monetary policy.   
Domestic Nonfinancial Sector Debt 
Business debt expanded 8½ percent in  2006, a considerable acceleration 
relative to the previous several year s.  A substantial fraction of borrowing 
proceeds for the year reportedly financed mergers and acquisitions as well as 
investment in plant and equipment.  Net bond issuance proceeded at a good clip, with offerings above those seen si nce 2001.  Similarly, commercial paper 
issuance was the strongest it has been since 2000.         
C&I lending by banks expanded ra pidly through much of the year, 
supported by an accommodative lendin g environment.  In the Federal 
Reserve’s Senior Loan Officer Opinion Su rveys in April and July, a significant 
net fraction of respondents indicated that they had eased credit standards and terms on C&I loans, pointing to more-aggressive competition from other 
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)
Page 24 of 40
lenders as the most important reason for having done so.  Notable net fractions 
of respondents to these surveys also cited greater liquidity in the secondary 
market for such loans and increased tole rance for risk as reasons for moving 
toward a more accommodative lending pos ture.  By October, however, this 
easing margin had disappeared, and C&I loans outstanding expanded at a 
somewhat more moderate rate towards the end of the year.     
Gross equity issuance by nonfinancial  corporations in  2006 was similar 
to that seen over the past several years  but was dwarfed by equity retirements, 
producing large negative net equity issuan ce overall.  Massive equity retirements 
resulted from an elevated level of cash-financed mergers and record share 
repurchases amid strong profits and ample  cash on corporate balance sheets.  
The expansion of commercial mortgage  debt in 2006 remained rapid by 
historical standards but came in below last year’s torrid pace, likely reflecting 
the rise in commercial mortgage rates an d a net tightening of credit standards 
for these loans consistent with responses  to the July and October Senior Loan 
Officer Opinion Surveys.  With rents climbing and vacancy rates falling, 
delinquency rates on commercial real estate loans have been low, and spreads 
on investment-grade commercial-mortgage-backed securities remain quite 
narrow.   
Overall, the credit quality of nonfinancial firms has generally remained 
very solid.  Corporate earnings have st ayed strong, and balance sheet liquidity, 
although a bit less than last year, continues to be high.  Corporate leverage is 
near multi-decade lows, and the six-month trailing bond default rate is near 
zero.  The delinquency rate on business loans is extremely low, as is the 
expected year-ahead default rate me asured by the KMV index.     
Household debt is estimated to have  expanded about 8 percent in 2006, 
considerably slower than the robust 12 percent increase seen in 2005.  Growth 
of home mortgage debt dropped about 5 percentage points to a rate of just under 9 percent, as house prices deceler ated substantially and home purchases 
and residential investment slowed.  Nonetheless, homeowners continued to extract equity from their homes, as hom e equity lending remained active and 
the volume of gross cash-out refina ncing exceeded 2005 levels.  Mortgage 
borrowing likely continued to take the place of some other forms of 
borrowing, and consumer credit expanded  only 5 percent in 2006.       
The financial obligations ratio rose to new highs this year as household 
debt grew more rapidly than disposable personal income and as rising interest 
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)
Page 25 of 40
rates contributed to an associated increase in debt service payments.  To date, 
evidence suggests that most households have been able to meet their 
obligations, although there are indica tions of growing strain among some 
groups.  Delinquency rates on consum er loans and prime mortgages have 
remained on the low side, but delinquency rates on subprime residential 
mortgages—in particular, those with variable interest rates—have increased 
markedly.  Meanwhile, household bankru ptcy filings continue to run at a pace 
well below the average of recent years.  Ba nkruptcies were likely damped by the 
decisions of some households in the fall  of 2005 to accelerate their filings to 
avoid more onerous requirements of the new bankruptcy law. 
The ratio of household net worth to disposable personal income is 
estimated to have increased a little, on ne t, over 2006, as the value of household 
assets was boosted by double-digit gains in equity prices.  Personal saving 
remained at a historically low level.  After substantial inflows in the first 
quarter, investors withdrew funds, on net,  from domestic equity mutual funds 
in the second and third quarters.  Mean while international equity funds saw 
substantial inflows over the course of th e year, and inflows to bond funds were 
on pace to reach highs not s een for several years.    
Borrowing by state and local governments dropped below its rapid 2005 
pace amid improved budgets and fewer advance refunding issues.  That said, 
bond issuance for new capital expenditures in the education, transportation, 
and housing sectors rose over the second half of the year and supported a rise 
in overall borrowing.  Credit quality in  the state and local sector improved 
substantially, as the number of credit  rating upgrades far exceeded the small 
number of downgrades.   
The Treasury borrowed about 20 percent less from the public on net 
during this calendar year than it did in 2005.  A 12 percent increase in tax receipts outpaced a 7 percent rise in outl ays, leading to a substantial decline in 
the federal deficit.  In February, the Treasury auctioned thirty-year bonds for 
the first time since 2001; the offering wa s well received.  Average participation 
by foreigners in Treasury coupon security  auctions this year was similar to that 
in 2005 but below its peak in 2004.     
Bank Credit 
Commercial bank credit expanded at a 10½ percent annual rate over the 
first three quarters of the year, supported by brisk growth in loans to both businesses and households.  C&I loans incr eased at a very rapid pace over this 
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)
Page 26 of 40
period, reportedly fueled by vigorous merger and acquisition activity, rising 
outlays for investment goods, ongoing inventory accumulation, and an 
accommodative lending environment.  Gr owth in commercial real estate loans 
was also quite elevated, supported by  strong fundamentals and favorable 
lending conditions.  Simila rly, supportive housing market conditions lifted real 
estate lending to households over this  period, and consumer loans held by 
banks grew relatively briskly.  Howeve r, bank credit is estimated to have 
decelerated sharply in the fourth quarter, driven by a reducti on in growth in all 
major loan categories as well as a contraction in securities holdings.1  The 
stepdown in C&I loan growth in the fourth quarter appears to have been concentrated at small banks.  Growth in loans backed by residential real estate 
is estimated to have come to a halt in the fourth quarter, likely reflecting in part 
the cooling in the housing market.   
M2 Monetary Aggregate 
The effects of the rise in short-term interest rates associated with 
monetary policy tightenings held M2 grow th equal to or below that of nominal 
income for the first three quarters of the year, but the aggregate is estimated to have grown robustly in the fourth qua rter.  Retail money market mutual funds 
and small time deposits, components of  M2 whose yields rise with market 
rates, grew rapidly all year.   In contrast, liquid depos its, whose yields adjust 
more gradually, declined on net over the first three quarters, but rebounded in the fourth quarter.  Currency has grown only moderately, as it did in 2005, 
reflecting weak demand both domestically and internationally.  For the year as a 
whole, M2 is estimated to have expanded  about 5 percent.  The velocity of M2 
rose ½ percentage point, a considerab ly smaller increase than would be 
expected based on its empirical relati onship with opportunity cost since the 
early 1990s.

Appendix B: Measures of the  Equilibrium Real Rate 
 
The equilibrium real rate is the real  federal funds rate that, if maintained, would be projected to return 
output to its potential level over time.   The short-run equilibrium rate is  defined as the rate that would 
close the output gap in twelve qua rters given the corresponding model’ s projection of the economy.   
The medium-run concept is the value of  the real federal funds rate proj ected to keep ou tput at potential 
in seven years, under the assumption that monetary policy acts to bring actua l and potential output into 
line in the short run and then keeps them equal thereafter.  The TIPS-based factor model measure 
provides an estimate of market expectations for the real federal funds rate seven years ahead.  
 
The actual real federal funds rate is  constructed as the difference betw een the nominal rate and realized 
inflation, where the nominal rate is measured as the quarterly average of the observed federal funds rate, 
and realized inflation is given by the log difference between the staff’s estimate of the core PCE price 
index and its lagged value four quarters earlier.  For th e current quarter, the nomina l rate is specified as 
the target federal funds rate on the Bluebook publication date.  
 
Confidence intervals reflect uncertainties about model specification, coefficients, and the level of 
potential output.  The final column of the table in dicates the values for the current quarter based on  
the estimation for the previous Bluebook, except that the TIPS-based measure and the actual real funds 
rate are the values publish ed in the previous Bluebook. 
  
Measure Description 
Single-equation 
Model  The measure of the equilibrium real rate in the single-equation model is based on an 
estimated aggregate-demand relationship between  the current value of the output gap and 
its lagged values as well as the lagged va lues of the real federal funds rate. 
Small Structural 
Model  The small-scale model of the economy consists of equations for five variables: the output 
gap, the equity premium, the federal budget surp lus, the trend growth rate of output, and 
the real bond yield. 
Large Model 
(FRB/US) Estimates of the equilibrium real rate using FRB/US—the staff’s large-scale econometric 
model of the U.S. economy—depend on a very broad array of economic factors, some of 
which take the form of projected valu es of the model’s exogenous variables. 
Greenbook-
consistent  The FRB/US model is used in conjunction with an extended version of the Greenbook 
forecast to derive a Greenbook-consistent measure .  FRB/US is first add-factored so that 
its simulation matches the extended Greenbook forecast, and then a second simulation is 
run off this baseline to determine the value of the real federal funds rate that closes the 
output gap. 
TIPS-based 
Factor Model Yields on TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) reflect investors’ expectations of 
the future path of real interest rates, but also include term and liquidity premiums.  The 
TIPS-based measure of the equilibrium real ra te is constructed using the seven-year-ahead 
instantaneous real forward rate derived fro m TIPS yields as of the Bluebook publication 
date.  This forward rate is adjusted to remove estimates of the term and liquidity 
premiums based on a three-factor arbitrage -free term-structure model applied to TIPS 
yields, nominal yields, and inflation.  Because TIPS indexation is based on the total CPI, 
this measure is also adjusted for the me dium-term difference—projected at 40 basis 
points—between total CPI inflation and core PCE inflation.

Appendix C: Analysis of Policy Paths and Confidence Intervals 
 
Rule Specifications :  For the following rules, it denotes the federal funds rate for quarter t, while  
the explanatory variables include the staff’s projec tion of trailing four-quart er core PCE inflation ( πt), 
inflation two and three quarters ahead ( πt+2|t and π t+3|t), the output gap in the current period and one 
quarter ahead (t*
ty y−  and *
1| 1|tt tty y+ +−
44*), and the three-quarter-ahead forecast of annual average GDP 
growth relative to potential (3| 3| tt tty y Δ− Δ++ ), and *π denotes an assumed value of policymakers’ 
long-run inflation objective.  The outcome-based a nd forecast-based rules were estimated using real-
time data over the sample 1988:1-2005:4; each specifi cation was chosen using the Bayesian information 
criterion.  Each rule incorporates a 75 basis point sh ift in the intercept, specified as a sequence of  
25 basis point increments during the first three quarters of 1998.  The first two simple rules were 
proposed by Taylor (1993, 1999), while  the third is a vari ant of the Taylor ( 1999) rule—introduced  
in the August Bluebook—with  a higher value of r*.  The prescriptions of the first-difference rule do  
not depend on assumptions regarding r* or the level of the output  gap; see Orphanides (2003). 
 
Outcome-based rule it =  1.17i t-1–0.37i t-2+0.20[1.04  + 1.76 πt  + 3.32(*

Taylor (1999) rule  it = 2 + πt + 0.5(πt –*π) + (*

Taylor (1999) rule     
with higher r* it = 2.75 + πt + 0.5(πt – *π) + (*
tty y− )  
First-difference rule it = i t-1 + 0.5(πt+3|t –*π) + 0.5(44*
3| 3| tt tty y+ + Δ− Δ ) 
   
FRB/US Model Simulations :  Prescriptions from the two empiri cal rules are computed using dynamic 
simulations of the FRB/US model, implemented as though the rule is followed starting at this FOMC 
meeting.  This quarter’s prescription is a weighted average of the actual value of the federal funds rate 
thus far this quarter and the value obtained from th e FRB/US model simulations using the timing of this 
meeting within the quarter to determine the weights.  Confidence intervals are based on stochastic 
simulations of the FRB/US model with shocks drawn from the estimated residuals over 1986-2005.  
  
Information from Financial Markets :  The expected funds rate path is based on federal funds  
and Eurodollar futures quotes.  The confidence interval s for this path are obtained from prices of  
at-the-money options contracts that are tr aded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.  
 
Near-Term Prescriptions of Simple Policy Rules :  These prescriptions are calculated using Greenbook 
projections for inflation and the output gap.  The first-difference rule’s  one-quarter-ahead  prescription is 
computed using that rule’s prescr iption for the curre nt quarter.

Inflation Indicator Based on M2
Note: P* is defined to equal M2 times V* divided by potential GDP. V*, or long-run velocity, is estimated
using average velocity over the 1959:Q1-to-1989:Q4 period and then, after a break, over the interval from
1993:Q1 to the present. For the forecast period, P* is based on the staff M2 forecast and P is simulated using a
short-run dynamic model relating P to P*. Blue areas indicate periods in which P* is notably less than P.
Gray areas denote the projection period.1965 1968 1971 1974 1977 1980 1983 1986 1989 1992 1995 1998 2001 2004 2007 40 60 80100120140Ratio scale Price Level
