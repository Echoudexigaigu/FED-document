MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES  
Recent Developments 
(1) The FOMC’s decision at its March meet ing to leave the federal funds rate 
target unchanged at 5¼ percent accorded  with market expectations.  However, 
investors read the accompanying statement as  signaling that policy easing might begin 
sooner than had been anticipated, give n the replacement of the reference to 
“additional firming” with more balanced language and the somewhat weaker-than-
expected characterization of recent economic indicators.  Even though there was little 
apparent net impetus from economic data released over the intermeeting period, on 
balance, money market futures rates subsequently more than reversed their initial decline.  The upward pressure on futures qu otes probably owed in part to monetary 
policy communications—including the Chairman’s testimony to the Joint Economic 
Committee, speeches by FOMC members, an d the release of the minutes of the 
March meeting—that were seen as affirming that upside risk to inflation remained the 
Committee’s predominant concern.  Futures quotes now indicate that market participants generally expect the target rate  to be left unchanged at the May and June 
meetings and to be eased about ¾ percenta ge point by the end of 2008 (Chart 1).  
Respondents to the Desk’s survey of primary dealers generally anticipate no change in 
the policy rate and few changes to the st atement at next week’s meeting, and they 
expect about 50 basis points of easing by the end of 2008, somewhat less than futures 
quotes imply.  Option-implied measures of uncertainty about the near-term path of 
policy were little changed over the intermeeting period, and the implied probability distribution for the target rate six months ahead shows about the same skew toward lower rates as it did at the time of the March meeting.  Despite the large flows of 
individual nonwithheld tax payments to the Treasury toward the end of the

intermeeting period, the federal funds rate di d not deviate from the target more than 
is typical (see box entitled “Tax R eceipts and Open Market Operations”).1  
(2) In the Treasury market, two- and ten-year nominal yields rose modestly 
over the intermeeting period.  TIPS-based  inflation compensation edged up amid a 
noticeable rise in oil prices, and consumer  survey responses also  suggested slightly 
higher short- and long-term inflation expect ations.  Broad equity indexes have risen 
about 6 percent since the March FOMC meet ing and 8 percent since the publication 
of the March Greenbook (Chart  2).  The gains came on the heels of somewhat better-
than-expected first-quarter earnings reports and a lessening of the concerns about the 
outlook that gripped markets in late Februa ry.  Spreads of yields on investment-grade 
corporate bonds over those on comparable- maturity Treasury securities were about 
unchanged, while those on speculative-grade bonds narrowed somewhat.   
(3) Domestic financial market conditions  have broadly recovered from the 
sharp increase in volatility and the associated withdrawal from risk-taking that occurred in late February and the first half  of March.  Markets functioned well over 
the intermeeting period, and implied volatilities in various markets retraced all or part of their earlier increases.  After several large investment banks with substantial 
exposures to subprime mortgages reported st rong first-quarter earnings, equity and 
credit market anxiety about spillovers from that sector appeared to ease.  
Nevertheless, credit default swap (CDS) sp reads on some of these investment banks 
remained somewhat above their levels early this year, although well within the range 
observed over the previous three years.  Th ere were other signs that investors had 
reassessed the risk inherent in some positions  relative to earlier in the year:  Spreads

1 The effective federal funds rate averaged 5.25 pe rcent over the intermeeting period.  During the 
period, System holdings of Treasury coupon securiti es increased by $7.4 billion.  The volume of 
outstanding long-term RPs decreased by $9 billion,  to $12 billion, as the Desk relied on short-term 
operations to address fluctuations in balances due to tax flows.

Tax Receipts and Open Market Operations 
 
The Desk faced significant reserve management challenges late in the 
intermeeting period, as large individual in come tax payments boosted the Treasury’s 
operating cash balance to unusually high levels.  Typically, the Treasury invests the 
bulk of its operating balance in the Tr easury Tax and Loan (TT&L) system and 
targets a balance of $5 billion in the Trea sury General Account (TGA) at the Federal 
Reserve.  Tax receipts for April and May ar e estimated to be about 13 percent higher 
than last year, and the Treasury’s operati ng balance—the dotted line in the chart 
below—exceeded the capacity of the TT&L  system—the solid line—on a few days 
beginning on April 30.  As a result, the TGA—the dashed line—rose above its $5 billion target level, reaching nearly $30 billion.  
In general, an increase in the TGA redu ces the banking sector’s balances at the 
Fed.  To maintain the target federal fund s rate, the Desk must add balances through 
open market operations, traditionally using re purchase agreements (RPs) because the 
need to add these balances is temporar y.  However, propositions from primary 
dealers for RPs can be limited on the mont h end, so the Desk was confronted with 
the challenge of adding a substantial amoun t of balances on a day when its ability to 
conduct a short-term adding operation could be limited. 
The Desk addressed this problem in a nu mber of ways.  First, on April 25, the 
Desk arranged a forward repurchase agreem ent to settle on April 30.  This forward 
operation gave the primary dealers the opportu nity to obtain collateral to pledge to 
the Desk that might otherwise have become  scarce on the month end.  In addition, 
the Desk performed term RP operations on se veral days leading up to the month end.  
To avoid providing more balances than demanded on the days immediately preceding 
the month end, the Desk conducted reverse RP operations on April 26 and 27, the 
first such operations since 2004.

remained very high over the intermeeting period, and corporate CDS spreads for a 
number of firms at the low end of the cred it-quality spectrum were still quite a bit 
above their levels early in the year.  
(4) Economic prospects abroad brightened relative to those in the United 
States, and the foreign exchange value of the dollar moved down 2 percent on balance 
over the intermeeting period against a trade-weighted index of major foreign 
currencies (Chart 3).  Market participants’ reaction to signs of firmer growth in the 
euro area, most notably in Germany, led the euro to appreciate almost 2 percent 
against the dollar.  Concerns about inflatio nary pressures in the United Kingdom and 
Canada, and heightened expectations of a policy response, contributed to 
appreciations of 1½ percent and 4½ per cent, respectively, for those countries’ 
currencies against the dollar.  Data showing that U.K. inflation exceeded 3 percent in 
the twelve months ending in March required the Governor of the Bank of England to 
submit a letter of explanation to the Chance llor of the Exchequer.  The yen proved to 
be an exception to the general pattern of  dollar weakness:  The dollar increased more 
than 2 percent against the yen, reportedly in  part on the re-establishment of carry 
trades as market participants’ concerns a bout volatility waned.  Yields on long-term 
sovereign debt in Europe rose about 30 basis points; increases in Canadian and 
Japanese long-term yields were smaller and closer to those on comparable U.S. 
securities.  Broad stock price indexes in maj or foreign industrial countries recorded 
gains of 4 to 7 percent over the interm eeting period, except in Japan where the 
TOPIX was down slightly on balance.2

market countries appeared to benefit from  investors returning to positions with 
greater risk.  EMBI+ spreads in Mexico and Brazil narrowed to record lows during 
the period, and yields on their local currenc y long-term sovereign securities recorded 
substantial declines.  Mexican-peso yields re traced their decline in recent days after the 
Bank of Mexico surprised the market by tighte ning in late April, citing concerns about 
inflation.  Most stock price indexes in La tin America and Asia registered hefty gains 
over the intermeeting period, led by an increa se of more than 25 percent in China.   
(6) Expansion of domestic nonfinancial sector  debt slowed to an annual rate of 
6¾ percent in the first quarter, reflecting a reduced pace of borrowing by businesses, 
households, and state and local governments (Chart 4).  Nonfinancial business debt 
slowed somewhat from its rapid fourth-quart er pace, but still expanded at a 9 percent 
rate in the first quarter as merger and acquisition activity continued to underpin 
substantial bond issuance.  On a period-ave rage basis, strong growth of commercial 
real estate loans partly offset a slowdown  in the growth of C&I loans in the first 
quarter.  The pace of C&I lending picked up  in April, consistent with the further 
narrowing of spreads on such loans repor ted in the April Senior Loan Officer 
Opinion Survey.  With house prices likely decelerating a bit further, growth of home 
mortgage debt likely slowed to a 5¾ per cent rate in the first quarter.  On net, 
respondents to the April Senior Loan Office r Opinion Survey reported a tightening of 
mortgage lending standards, especially for subprime and nontraditional loans, and a 
moderate net weakening in mo rtgage demand.  Consumer credit growth in the first 
quarter is estimated to have slowed slightly  to an annual rate of 4 percent.  The 
Treasury scaled back its regular bill issuance  significantly in view of large anticipated 
tax inflows over the latter half of April and early May.  Given favorable deficit trends, 
the Treasury announced, as expected, that it  plans to discontinue the three-year note 
from its regular auction schedule be ginning with the August refunding.

(7) At a 9 percent annual rate, M2 growth  was brisk in March and April.  
Retail money funds surged in March follow ing the financial market volatility at the 
end of February.  Growth of liquid deposits is estimated to have been somewhat 
elevated in April as households accumulate d balances in anticipation of making final 
payments of individual nonwithheld taxes.  Ov erall, growth in M2 has remained more 
robust than historical relationships with opportunity cost and nominal output would 
indicate, and M2 velocity is estimated to ha ve dropped further over the first quarter. 
Economic Outlook through 2008  
(8) The broad contours of the staff’s forecast for economic activity and 
inflation are little changed since the March Greenbook, as the drag of a softer housing 
market and the jump in oil prices about offs et the impetus from hi gher equity prices 
and a weaker dollar.  The pace of economic ex pansion is projected to pick up from its 
first-quarter soft patch and to match the sta ff’s estimate of potential  output growth by 
2008.  The labor market is anticipated to be sl ightly tighter than in the March forecast, 
with the unemployment rate not expected to  rise to the staff’s estimate of the NAIRU 
of about 5 percent until the end of 2008.   This projection is predicated on the 
Committee holding policy unchanged over th e next two years, rather than easing 
slightly in mid-2008 as assumed in the pr evious Greenbook.  Longer-term yields are 
again projected to firm a bit over the forecast  period and equity prices to rise at about 
a 6½ percent annual rate, albeit from a st arting point 6½ percent higher than in 
March.  The foreign exchange value of the dollar depreciates gradually as in previous 
forecasts, but along a track that is 1½ percen t lower than in March.  The path of oil 
prices has been marked up about $5 per barre l in light of the rise in both spot and 
futures quotes.  The projected flattening out of energy and other commodity prices 
helps to nudge core PCE inflation down fr om 2¼ percent in 2007 to a little over 
2 percent by the end of 2008—a shade higher  than projected in the last Greenbook.  
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)
Page 10 of 36
Headline PCE inflation is expected to ru n close to 3 percent in 2007, boosted by 
higher energy prices, before slow ing to around 2 percent in 2008. 
Update on Medium-Term Strategies  
(9) This section provides an update of the materials on medium-term 
strategies for monetary policy that were pr esented in the March Bluebook.  As shown 
in Chart 5, in light of the changes to the staff’s outlook, the Greenbook-consistent 
measure of short-run r*—the value that would close the output gap over the next 
twelve quarters—has shifted up about 20 basis points.  This measure of short-run r* 
remains in line with the actual real fede ral funds rate—constructed as the current 
nominal rate less the average core PCE infl ation rate over the past year—and is about 
¾ percentage point above the upper range of model-based estimates .3  
(10) Chart 6 depicts the results of optimal  control simulations of the FRB/US 
model that are based on the staff’s exte nsion of the Greenbook forecast beyond 
2008.4  In these simulations, policymakers pl ace equal weights on  keeping core PCE 
inflation close to a specified goal, on keep ing unemployment close to the long-run 
NAIRU, and on avoiding changes in the nominal funds rate.5  With an inflation goal 
of 2 percent (the right-hand set of charts),  the optimal policy prescribes a funds rate 
                                           
3 The measure of the actual real funds rate re ported here is 20 basis points higher than  
in the previous Bluebook because the relatively  elevated core inflation rate in 2006Q2  
no longer enters into the backward-looking m oving average of core PCE inflation used  
in its construction. 
 
4 This extension generally incorporates th e same medium-term assumptions used to  
generate the illustrative extens ion discussed in the March Bluebook.  For further details,  
see the memo to the Committee by Michael K iley, David Reifschneid er, John Roberts,  
and William Wascher, “The Extended  Greenbook Forecast,” May 2, 2007. 
 
5  In conducting these simula tions, policymakers and participants in financial markets are 
assumed to understand fully the forces shap ing the economic outlook (as summarized by  
the extended Greenbook projection), whereas hou seholds and firms form their expectations 
using more limited information.

path that remains close to 5¼ percent through mid-2008 and then declines gradually 
to just above 4 percent by the end of 2012.  With an inflation go al of 1½ percent (the 
left-hand set of charts), the optimal path of the funds rate rises to about 6 percent 
over the next few quarters and then declines  gradually to about 3¾ percent by 2012.  
For either inflation goal, the optimal fund s rate path from mid-2008 through the end 
of 2012 is roughly ¼ percentage point high er than in the March Bluebook, while the 
outcomes for unemployment and inflation are broadly unchanged.  These patterns 
largely reflect the staff’s modest downward  revision to potential output and the 
projection of more robust underlying aggregate demand, the same factors that 
generate the upward shift in the Greenbook-consistent measure of short-run r*. 
(11) As shown in Chart 7, the estimated outcome-based rule prescribes a funds  
rate path that stays in a range of 5 to 5¼ percent over the next several years. The 
near-term prescriptions from the simple po licy rules proposed by Taylor (1993, 1999) 
are a notch tighter than in March, reflecting the staff’s assessment of a modestly larger 
output gap.  As in March, these rules gene rally stipulate a downward-sloping path of 
policy, whereas the first-difference rule—w hich does not involv e the level of the 
output gap—now points to a flat or upward-sloping funds rate path, depending on 
the inflation goal. 
Short-Run Policy Alternatives  
(12) This Bluebook presents three poli cy alternatives for the Committee’s 
consideration, summarized in Table 1.  Under Alternative A, the Committee lowers

economy seems likely to continue to 
expand at a moderate pace over 
coming quarters. The economy seems most  likely to

high level of resource utilization has 
the potential to sustain those

Assessment 
of Risk 4. In these circumstances, the

concern remains the risk that

expected.  Future policy adjustments 
will depend on the evolution of the 
outlook for both inflation and 
economic growth, as implied by

moderate pace” no longer seems appropria te.  Moreover, given the dip in core 
inflation in March, the reference in the prev ious statement to recent inflation readings 
being elevated has been replaced with the more general observation that “core 
inflation remains somewhat elevated on bala nce.”  The formulati on used in the March 
risk assessment that “future policy adjust ments will depend on the evolution of the 
outlook for both inflation and economic growth” is retained in all three alternatives.  
With the April employment report to be re leased on Friday, after the Bluebook closes, 
the wording of the draft statements should be viewed as more tentative than usual, 
and there is always the opportunity to comb ine rows from the different columns of 
the table. 
(13) In March, members apparently judged that maintaining the current target 
federal funds rate provided the best chan ce of fostering moderate economic growth 
and a gradual ebbing in core inflation.  The incoming data over the intermeeting 
period have not altered significantly the sta ff’s assessment of the prospects for growth 
and inflation.  If the Committee similarly has not substantially changed its assessment 
of the economic outlook, it may be attracted to Alternative B , under which the 
federal funds rate is maintained at 5¼ percent and the statement continues to 
highlight concern about inflation.  Indeed , members may believe that both the upside 
and downside risks associated with maint aining the current target rate have 
diminished somewhat, given that the turmoi l in the subprime market does not appear 
to have spread to the rest of the mortgage  market or to have led to a more general 
retrenchment in financial markets and that readings on core inflation in March were 
more favorable.  In the staff’s analysis, th e real federal funds rate is close to the 
Greenbook-consistent measure of its equilibr ium value, suggesting that the current 
stance of policy, if maintained, is likely to  return output to a more sustainable level 
over time.  While members may harbor concerns about the glacial pace of the 
projected moderation in core inflation,  they may nevertheless prefer a patient 
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)
Page 17 of 36
approach rather than incur the risks associat ed with fostering a more rapid disinflation 
in an environment of soft economic grow th.  In such circum stances, the Committee 
might wish to be particularly clear that  its patience does not represent a down-
weighting of its long-run inflation objective. 
(14) The statement accompanying Alternative B could acknowledge that 
economic growth slowed in the first part of the year, but indicate that the economy 
still seems likely to expand at a moderate pace over coming quar ters.  The statement 
would reiterate the risks to inflation posed by the high level of resource utilization and 
conclude, as in March, that the Committ ee’s predominant policy concern remains the 
risk that inflation will fail to moderate as expected. 
(15) Investors see virtually no chance of a policy change at this meeting.  
Likewise, given the revisions to the langua ge in the statement in March, the Desk’s 
survey suggests that most primary dealers do not expect substantive changes to the 
statement.  Thus, implementing Alternat ive B is likely to provoke little market 
reaction.   
(16) Even if the Committee views the st aff’s central outlook as broadly 
plausible and desirable, members may judge that the risk of persistently weaker 
economic growth is unacceptably large.  If so, the Committee might wish to reduce 
the chance of a more pronounced economic  slowdown by easing policy 25 basis 
points as in Alternative A .  The recent disappointing data on home sales and 
inventories of new homes for sale may heighten concern that the extent of the 
ongoing adjustment in the housing market an d associated spillovers to household and 
business spending could be greater than currently anticipated.  Moreover, members 
might worry that the economic fundamental s supporting the expansion going forward 
could be less robust than envisaged by the st aff.  In particular, the recent weakness in 
business spending may indicate that firm s have grown less optimistic about future 
returns, which could continue to weigh on investment plans in coming quarters.  This 
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)
Page 18 of 36
relative pessimism could also conceivably co lor firms’ hiring decisions—especially if 
the recent strength of employment is  a lagging phenomenon reflecting labor 
hoarding—and so damp prospects for households’ income and consumption.  And 
financial conditions might turn less favora ble; in particular, long rates may move 
significantly higher if monetary policy is no t eased as expected, an d equity prices could 
fall short of the Greenbook proj ection if corporate earnings slow as anticipated by the 
staff.  The possibility that the fundament als supporting the economic expansion might 
prove to be weaker than expected is expl ored in the Greenbook alternative simulation 
“Business caution with fi nancial spillovers.”   
(17) The rationale for Alternative A wo uld note that, although the economy 
seems most likely to expand at a moderate  pace, the weakness in housing and capital 
spending implies a significant risk that econom ic activity might grow more slowly than 
anticipated.  Given the moderation in infl ation in March, the Committee might wish 
to switch the ordering of the clauses in th e second sentence of the inflation paragraph 
to suggest a slightly more benign outlook fo r inflation.  Even so, with opposing risks 
to activity and inflation, the statement wo uld indicate that the Committee has no clear 
predilection concerning the likely futu re direction of policy and that policy 
adjustments will depend on the ev olution of the economic outlook. 
(18) Although investors apparently expect the Committee to begin easing 
policy later this year, an immediate quarter-point rate cut would catch financial market 
participants unawares, likely leading to a substantial downward revision to the expected path for policy.  Long-term yields might also fall if investors surmised that 
the real interest rate consistent with maint aining moderate growth had declined.  But 
that fall might be tempered, or even reversed , if the surprise cut caused investors to 
revise up their expected medium-term path  for inflation and economic growth.  The 
foreign exchange value of the dollar likely would weaken in response to the unexpected easing, and equity prices probably would rally. 
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)
Page 19 of 36
(19) In contrast, members might be concerne d that inflation will not moderate 
as the staff expects, and that the costs of in flation persisting at elevated levels for a 
prolonged period could be substantial.  If so, the Committee might prefer to foster a 
more decisive slowing in inflation by tighteni ng 25 basis points at this meeting, as in 
Alternative C .  Price pressures might not yet be  viewed as convincingly on a 
downward trend, and the softening in the dollar and increases in energy and other 
commodity prices since the March meetin g may have heightened the Committee’s 
concerns about the inflation outlook.  More over, with the staff forecast suggesting 
that the pace of moderation in core inflatio n might be even slower than previously 
anticipated, members may perceive an in creasing risk that long-run inflation 
expectations might drift up, as illustrated by the Greenbook alternative scenario 
“Unanchored inflation expectations.”     
(20) The statement accompanying Alternative C could reiterate the 
Committee’s judgment that the economy seems likely to expand at a moderate pace.  The Committee’s concern about the prospect s for inflation could be stressed by 
noting that “considerable uncertainty” surrounds the judgment that inflation is likely to moderate.  The sources of upside risk to inflation could be broadened to include 
reference to the recent increases in ener gy and other commodity prices.   The 
statement could conclude by noting that , even after the policy tightening, the 
Committee’s predominant concern remains  the upside risks to inflation. 
(21) A decision to firm policy at this meeting would stun financial markets, 
particularly given the changes made to the risk assessment in the March statement.  
Market participants would mark up substant ially their short-term outlook for policy, 
and similarly increase the uncertainty a ttached to that outlook.  Short- and 
intermediate-term interest rates would move up significantly.  The response of longer-
term rates would depend on whether the surprise tightening caused participants to 
lower their expected path for medium-t erm inflation and economic growth, and 
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)
Page 20 of 36
whether that change was sufficient to offset  the impact of the upward revision to the 
short-term policy outlook.  The foreign ex change value of the dollar probably would 
increase in response to the hike in short ra tes, while equity prices  likely would fall. 
Money and Debt Forecasts  
(22) Under the Greenbook forecast, M2 is  expected to expand about 
5½ percent in 2007 before slowing to 5 percent in 2008.  The forecast implies a 
decline in M2 velocity in each year, consiste nt with a modest reduction in opportunity 
cost.  The projection for M2 growth this year  is a little above that in March, reflecting 
the unexpected strength of incoming da ta.  Within M2, liquid deposits grow 
moderately, and rapid expansion in retail money funds offsets sluggish advances in 
both small time deposits and currency. 
(23) The growth of domestic nonfinancial sect or debt is projected to fall from 
last year’s increase of nearly 8 percent to 6½  percent in 2007 and 5¾ percent in 2008.  
In the household sector, flat housing prices are expected to dampen mortgage 
borrowing over the forecast period.  Corpor ate borrowing is also anticipated to slow, 
as the recent strong pace of merger-related debt issuance ebbs.  Federal debt growth is 
projected to pick up gradually this year and next.

Appendix A: Measures of the  Equilibrium Real Rate 
 
The equilibrium real rate is the real  federal funds rate that, if mainta ined, would be projected to return 
output to its potential level over time.   The short-run equilibrium rate is  defined as the rate that would 
close the output gap in twelve qua rters given the corresponding model’ s projection of the economy.   
The medium-run concept is the value of  the real federal funds rate proj ected to keep ou tput at potential 
in seven years, under the assumption that monetary policy acts to bring actua l and potential output into 
line in the short run and then keeps them equal thereafter.  The TIPS-based factor model measure 
provides an estimate of market expectations for the real federal funds rate seven years ahead.  
 
The actual real federal funds rate is  constructed as the difference betw een the nominal rate and realized 
inflation, where the nominal rate is measured as the quarterly average of the observed federal funds rate, 
and realized inflation is given by the log difference between the co re PCE price index and its lagged 
value four quarters earlier.  For th e current quarter, the nominal rate is specified as the target federal 
funds rate on the Bluebook publication date.  For the current quarter and th e previous quarter, the 
inflation rate is computed using the sta ff’s estimate of the core PCE price index. 
 
Confidence intervals reflect uncer tainties about model specification, coefficients, and the level of 
potential output.  The final column of the table in dicates the values published in the previous Bluebook. 
  
Measure Description 
Single-equation 
Model   The measure of the equilibrium real rate in the single-equation model is based on an 
estimated aggregate-demand relationship between  the current value of the output gap and 
its lagged values as well as the lagged va lues of the real federal funds rate. 
Small Structural 
Model  The small-scale model of the economy consists of equations for five variables: the output 
gap, the equity premium, the federal budget surp lus, the trend growth rate of output, and 
the real bond yield. 
Large Model 
(FRB/US)  Estimates of the equilibrium real rate using FRB/US—the staff’s large-scale econometric 
model of the U.S. economy—depend on a very broad array of economic factors, some of 
which take the form of projected valu es of the model’s exogenous variables. 
Greenbook-
consistent  The FRB/US model is used in conjunction with an extended version of the Greenbook 
forecast to derive a Greenbook-consistent measure .  FRB/US is first add-factored so that 
its simulation matches the extended Greenbook forecast, and then a second simulation is 
run off this baseline to determine the value of  the real federal funds rate that closes the 
output gap. 
TIPS-based 
Factor Model Yields on TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) reflect investors’ expectations of 
the future path of real interest rates, but also include term and liquidity premiums.  The 
TIPS-based measure of the equilibrium real ra te is constructed using the seven-year-ahead 
instantaneous real forward rate derived fro m TIPS yields as of the Bluebook publication 
date.  This forward rate is adjusted to remove estimates of the term and liquidity 
premiums based on a three-factor arbitrage -free term-structure model applied to TIPS 
yields, nominal yields, and inflation.  Because TIPS indexation is based on the total CPI, 
this measure is also adjusted for the me dium-term difference—projected at 40 basis 
points—between total CPI inflation and core PCE inflation.

Rule Specifications :  For the following rules, it denotes the federal funds rate for quarter t, while  
the explanatory variables include the staff’s projec tion of trailing four-quart er core PCE inflation ( πt), 
inflation two and three quarters ahead ( πt+2|t and πt+3|t), the output gap in the current period and one 
quarter ahead (*

growth relative to potential (44*
3| 3|tt ttyy++Δ− Δ ), and *π denotes an assumed value of policymakers’ 
long-run inflation objective.  The outcome-based a nd forecast-based rules were estimated using real-
time data over the sample 1988:1-2006:4; each specifi cation was chosen using th e Bayesian information 
criterion. Each rule incorporates a 75 basis point shift in the interc ept, specified as a sequence of  
25 basis point increments during the first three qu arters of 1998.  The first two simple rules were 
proposed by Taylor (1993, 1999), while  the third is a vari ant of the Taylor ( 1999) rule—introduced  
in the August Bluebook—with  a higher value of r*.  The prescriptions of the first-difference rule do  
not depend on assumptions regarding r* or the level of the output  gap; see Orphanides (2003).

FRB/US Model Simulations :  Prescriptions from the two empiri cal rules are computed using dynamic 
simulations of the FRB/US model, implemented as though the rule were followe d starting at this FOMC 
meeting.  The dotted line labeled “Previous Bluebook” is  based on the current specification of the policy 
rule, applied to the previous Gr eenbook projection.  Confidence inte rvals are based on stochastic 
simulations of the FRB/US model with shocks drawn from the estimated residuals over 1986-2005.  
Information from Financial Markets :  The expected funds rate pa th is based on forward rate 
agreements, and the confidence intervals for this path are constructed using prices of interest rate caps. 
Near-Term Prescriptions of Simple Policy Rules :  These prescriptions ar e calculated using Greenbook 
projections for inflation and the out put gap. Because the first-difference rule involves the lagged funds 
rate, the value labeled “Previous Bluebook” for the curr ent quarter is computed using the actual value  
of the lagged funds rate, and the one -quarter-ahead prescriptions are ba sed on this rule’s prescription for 
the current quarter.

                thereafter (median value of respondents).  Measures using the Michigan Survey employ the five− to ten−year
                inflation expectations from that survey (mean value of respondents).
                + For TIPS and nominal corporate rate, denotes the most recent weekly value. For other real rate series, denotes
                the most recent weekly nominal yield less the most recent inflation expectation.
                Note. Blue shaded regions denote NBER−dated recessions.

Inflation Indicator Based on M2
Note: P* is defined to equal M2 times V* divided by potential GDP. V*, or long-run velocity, is estimated
using average velocity over the 1959:Q1-to-1989:Q4 period and then, after a break, over the interval from
1993:Q1 to the present. For the forecast period, P* is based on the staff M2 forecast and P is simulated using a
short-run dynamic model relating P to P*. Blue areas indicate periods in which P* is notably less than P.
Gray areas denote the projection period.1965 1968 1971 1974 1977 1980 1983 1986 1989 1992 1995 1998 2001 2004 2007 40 60 80100120140Ratio scale Price Level
