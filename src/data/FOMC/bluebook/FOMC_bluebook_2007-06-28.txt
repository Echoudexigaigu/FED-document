MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES  
Recent Developments 
(1) The anticipated path of the federal funds rate embedded in financial market 
prices rotated up sharply over the intermeet ing period (Chart 1).  Only a small portion 
of this change, however, was po sted on the heels of the May 9th FOMC meeting.  The 
decision to leave the federal funds rate targ et unchanged at 5¼ percent accorded with 
market expectations, but some market partic ipants were reportedly surprised by the 
retention of the assessment that inflation was “somewhat elevated.”1  There was little 
market response to the publication of th e minutes of the m eeting.  Over the 
intermeeting period, however, investors seemed  to reappraise their beliefs that the 
economic expansion would slow and that  monetary policy easing would be 
forthcoming, based in part on monetary policy communications and the release of 
some more-favorable-than-expected economic da ta in the United States and abroad.   
(2) Futures quotes indicate that market participants now expect the FOMC to 
leave the target federal funds rate unchange d through the end of this year and see only 
about 25 basis points of easing by the end of 2008, about 60 basis points less than at 
the time of the May FOMC meeting.  As  indicated in the Desk’s recent survey, 
primary dealers also envision policy being on hold for some time, with a number of 
firms abandoning their forecasts for rate cuts this year.  These revisions were 
associated with a marked decline in the weight  attached to lower interest rates in the 
option-implied distributions of future federa l funds rates, and measures of uncertainty 
about the near-term path of policy narrowed to historical lows. 
                                           
1 The effective federal funds rate averaged 5.25 percent over the intermeeting period.  
During the period, System holdings of Treasury  securities were unchanged.  The volume of 
outstanding long-term RPs decreased by $1 billion, to $11 billion.

(3) Yields on nominal Treasury securities  rose sharply over the intermeeting 
period, with two-year rates increasing 30 ba sis points and ten-year rates gaining about 
55 basis points.  This upward shift in the term structure reflected increases in one-year 
forward rates across the yield curve, wi th the most pronounced gains posted in 
forward rates three to five years ahead.  Real rates accounted for the bulk of the 
increase.  TIPS-based inflation compensati on for the next five years edged lower on 
net, but five-to-ten-year-ahead inflation compensation rose about 20 basis points.  
Survey measures of inflation expectations posted mixed changes.  According to staff 
models, the pickup in real yiel ds at distant horizons owed pr imarily to increases in real 
term premiums, while about half of the incr ease in inflation compensation at the long 
end of the curve reflected increases in inflat ion expectations.  (See box entitled “More 
on Recent Interest Rate Developments.”) 
(4) Equity markets were volatile at time s during the intermeeting period, but 
broad stock price indexes gained about 1 percent, on net, as the boost from largely favorable news on the economy and annou ncements of mergers and acquisitions 
outweighed the drag of higher bond yields  (Chart 2).  The implied volatility of the 
S&P 500 edged up on net, but remained lo w by historical standards.  Yields on 
investment-grade corporate bonds increase d about in line with  those on nominal 
Treasury securities of comparable maturity.  In contrast, yields on speculative-grade 
corporate bonds rose less, leaving risk spreads about 20 basis points narrower.  
Corporate credit quality remained solid, with  realized and expected default rates 
staying very low. (5) Despite the substantial declines in bond  prices posted over the intermeeting 
period, fixed-income markets generally func tioned smoothly, with elevated Treasury 
trading volumes and normal bid-asked spre ads.  However, credit conditions in 
markets for assets backed by subprime mort gages deteriorated notably in some cases.  
For example, spreads on indexes of subprime credit default swaps rose steadily, and

The increase in shorter-term Treasury yields over the 
intermeeting period appeared to  reflect a revised outlook for 
monetary policy.  About half of  the 30 basis point move in two-
year yields occurred in the na rrow windows bracketing FOMC 
communications and economic data  releases.  Apparently in 
response to incoming news, as well as a more general change in 
sentiment, most of the remainin g primary dealers who had been 
predicting policy easing this year threw in the towel and now 
forecast policy to be on hold for some time.  Short-term yields 
around the globe also increased,  as data pointed to somewhat 
stronger growth and higher inflat ion in a number of countries, 
and some foreign central banks either tightened policy or 
signaled increased concern a bout inflationary pressures. 
 
The shift in the economic outlook was likely the prime mover of 
longer-term rates as well, but mortgage convexity hedging flows 
reportedly amplified these upward  movements in rates.  Swap 
spreads widened and swaption- implied volatility rose, as 
investors sought to trim longer-dated exposures when the 
effective duration of their mo rtgage holdings lengthened.  
However, the rise in swap rates was considerably smaller than during past episodes when conv exity hedging likely played a 
significant role.  Moreover, the staff estimates that only a small amount of mortgages was economically refinanceable even 
before the rise in mortgage rates.   
 Over this intermeeting peri od, changes in option-based 
measures of interest rate uncertainty have been mixed, as 
implied volatilities on short-te rm rates declined and those on 
longer-term rates rose.  Howeve r, the reduced skew of the 
implied distributions of expected  funds rates in the near term 
may go some way in helping to explain movements in term 
premiums.  Market participants now evidently see the risks to 
the outlook for short-term inte rest rates as more symmetric, as 
opposed to tilted sharply to the downside, and borrowers may 
be willing to pay a higher term  premium to avoid the risk of 
having to roll over debt at higher short-term rates in the future.

some of the indexes reached new highs.  Reflecting the weakness in these markets, 
and perhaps reinforcing them as well, were the well-publicized difficulties at two 
medium-sized hedge funds managed by Bear  Stearns Asset Management.  The funds 
were positioned to gain from an improvem ent in subprime credit quality, and when 
the market worsened instead, the resulting losses led to massive liquidity pressures on 
at least one of the two funds.  Following  unsuccessful negotiations to reach a 
workout, some counterparties moved to ta ke collateral and close out positions.  
Actual and anticipated sales of fund asse ts raised concerns that the resulting 
downward pressure on prices could le ad to significant losses among market 
participants.  These concerns were exacerbated by the high degree of uncertainty 
about the valuation of subprime assets, part icularly CDOs.  Spillover effects of the 
funds’ difficulties have apparently been modest thus far, although spreads on some 
lower-quality corporate credit derivative indexes also widened this week.  Market participants report no other sizable hedg e funds with similar problems.  Credit 
exposures to the two funds are widely disp ersed, and CDS spreads for the creditor 
firms have generally moved up only a few basis points.  Bear Stearns’s CDS spread 
has risen more, but it remains near the peak it reached during the period of volatility 
in late February and early March.   (6) The foreign exchange value of the do llar was little changed on balance over 
the intermeeting period against a trade-weig hted index of major foreign currencies 
(Chart 3).  The dollar fell 3 percent agai nst the Canadian dollar, but rose 3 percent 
against the Japanese yen and by smaller amo unts against most other major currencies.  
Day-to-day movements in foreign government  bond yields were highly correlated 
with fluctuations in U.S. longer-term rates, with yields abroad increasing 25 to 50 basis 
points, on net, somewhat less than in the Unit ed States.  As in the United States, most 
of the increases in foreign nominal yields re flected changes in real yields, which were 
boosted by stronger-than-expected indicato rs of economic growth and prospects for

tighter monetary policy.  Major foreign st ock markets posted modest gains.  As was 
widely expected, the Bank of England and the European Central Bank raised their 
policy rates 25 basis points.  In contrast, th e Bank of Canada and the Bank of Japan 
left their policy rates unchanged during th e intermeeting period.  However, strong 
data releases and a hawkish policy statement by the Bank of Canada appeared to buoy 
the Canadian dollar and fuel the relatively  large advance in Canadian bond yields 
relative to those in other foreign industrial countries.2  
(7) The value of the dollar was down slightly over the intermeeting period 
against an index of currencies of our ot her important trading partners, led by a 
5 percent decline against the Brazilian  real and a 1 percent fall against the Chinese 
renminbi.  Local-currency bond yields rose 30 to 60 basis points in emerging Asia and 
Eastern Europe.  Spreads on dollar-denomin ated issues in emerging markets, much 
like those in U.S. speculative-grade markets, declined slightly.  Stock prices in most 
emerging-market countries recorded solid ga ins over the period, including in China 
despite a sharp drop at the end of May rela ted to the increase of a tax on equity 
transactions.  (8) The debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors appears to be expanding at a 
6½ percent annual rate in the second qua rter, off a little from the 7¼ percent pace 
registered in the first quarter (Chart 4).  The slowdown is primarily attributable to a 
decline in debt growth for the federal go vernment, which has resulted from more-
than-seasonally strong tax receipts.  Business de bt is estimated to be rising at a robust 
10 percent rate, boosted by financing of a la rge volume of mergers and acquisitions.  
Both bond issuance and growth in business  loans have been brisk.  Bank lending 
standards and terms remain quite accommodative, with information from the

syndicated loan market indicating narrow sp reads, high leverage, and an erosion in 
loan covenants.  With house prices contin uing to be soft, home sales sluggish, and 
mortgage rates moving higher, growth of home mortgage debt is estimated to be 
slowing slightly to a 6 percent annual rate  in the second quarter, while the overall 
expansion of consumer credit appears modest at a 4¼ percent rate.   
(9) Smoothing through tax-related fluctuations, M2 grew at a 6 percent average 
annual rate in April and May, following su rprisingly strong ex pansion in the first 
quarter.  The moderation was broad-based and led by a decline in liquid deposit 
growth to a pace more in line with that  of nominal income.  Retail money market 
mutual funds and small time deposits also decelerated.  Currency growth continued to 
be modest, likely reflecti ng weak foreign demand.  
Economic Outlook through 2008 
(10) In response to incoming data over th e intermeeting period, the staff marked 
up its assessment of the pace of growth in  the second quarter but changed the broad 
contours of the forecast thereafter relati vely little from those in the May Greenbook.  
Smoothing through volatile quarterly reading s, real GDP is now seen as expanding at 
around a 2 percent annualized rate in the fi rst half of this year; the pace of real GDP 
growth is forecast to pick up to 2¼ per cent in the remainder of  2007 and 2½ percent 
in 2008.  As a consequence, the labor market is  expected to be slightly tighter than in 
the previous Greenbook, with the unemployment  rate predicted to rise slowly, but to 
remain below 5 percent ―the staff’s estimate of the NAIRU ―throughout the forecast 
period.  The staff forecast continues to be predicated on the assumption that the 
federal funds rate will be held at 5¼ pe rcent until the end of 2008.  Following the 
substantial upward shift in investors’ policy expectations over the intermeeting period, 
this trajectory is now very similar to th at implied by money market futures quotes.  
Consequently, with little expected change in  term premiums, longer-term interest rates 
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)
Page 10 of 42
are projected to remain near their current high er levels.  Equity prices are expected to 
rise at a rate sufficient to generate risk -adjusted returns comparable to those on fixed-
income investments.  The foreign exchange value of the dollar is assumed to 
depreciate 2 percent per year ―a somewhat faster pace than in the May forecast.  Spot 
oil prices are still expected to move some what higher, as informed by futures market 
quotes.  Recent favorable inflation readings led the staff to lower the core inflation 
forecast slightly.  The staff now expects co re PCE inflation to average 2 percent both 
this year and next.  Total PCE inflation is pr ojected to be nearly 3 percent this year, 
boosted by higher energy and other commodity prices, before falling back to 
2 percent in 2008.    
(11) In the survey of economic projections taken for the May meeting, the 
central tendency of FOMC participants’ fo recasts for real GDP growth was 2 to 
2.5 percent in 2007 and 2.5 to 2.8 percen t in 2008.  The central tendency of the 
forecasts for core PCE inflation was 2.1 to 2.3 percent this year and 1.8 to 2.1 percent 
next year.  The May Greenbook projection wa s at the bottom of the central tendency 
of FOMC participants’ forecasts for growth  and the top of the central tendency of 
their forecasts for inflation. 
Medium-Term Strategies 
(12) To provide a longer-term perspective on the economic outlook and possible 
monetary policy strategies, optimal control simulations of the FRB/US model were 
conducted using the staff’s extension of the Greenbook forecast beyond 2008.3  
These simulations employ a new benchmark specification of the model equation that 
determines the evolution of the long-run inflation expectations of wage and price 
setters, which are now assumed to res pond not only to movements in actual 
                                           
3 More information on the extended outlook is provided in the memo to the Committee  
by Thomas Laubach, “Extended Gr eenbook Forecast,” June 20, 2007. 
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)

inflation—as in previous Bluebooks—but also  to shifts in the nominal federal funds 
rate and the output gap.4  Because long-run inflation expectations in the previous 
specification responded quite slowly to change s in actual inflation, disinflation came  
at a relatively high cost in terms of cumulative labor market slack.  In contrast,  
the new specification implies that a shift in monetary policy directly affects the public’s perception of the central bank’s inflation goal and hence their long-run 
inflation expectations.  As a result, the costs of a policy-induced disinflation in 
FRB/US are lower than presented in prev ious Bluebooks and are now in closer 
alignment with the staff’s judgmental assessment.
5 
(13) Chart 5 shows optimal control simulati ons of the FRB/US model in which 
policymakers’ inflation goal is either 1½ percent or 2 percent.6  For an inflation goal 
of 2 percent (the right-hand set of charts),  the optimal control simulation prescribes  
a federal funds rate path that remains close to 5¼ percent through early 2009 and then declines gradually to just above 4 pe rcent by the end of 2012; from late 2008 
forward, the unemployment rate is near the 5 percent NAIRU, and core inflation  
is close to the 2 percent goal (solid lines).   This optimal policy outcome is similar to 
that shown in the May Bluebook (dotted lines); furthermore, the change to the 
                                          
 
4 For further details, see the memo to the Co mmittee by Michael Kiley, “Changes to the 
evolution of long-run inflation expectations in the FRB/US model and their implications  
for FRB/US properties and optimal c ontrol simulations,” June 11, 2007. 
5 In spirit, the new specification is broadly cons istent with private agents learning about  
the Committee’s inflation goal from poli cy surprises—as in the scenario dubbed learning from 
policy actions  that was discussed in the March Bl uebook box, “Inflation Expectations and 
Optimal Control Policies.”  An extr eme version of learning is the immediate-recognition  scenario 
of the March Bluebook in which wage and pr ice setters match their long-run inflation 
expectations to the announced se tting of the policymakers’ goal. 
6 Policymakers are assumed to place equal weig ht on three stabilization objectives: limiting 
deviations of core PCE inflation from a specifi ed goal, limiting deviations of unemployment 
from the long-run NAIRU, and limiting change s in the nominal funds rate.  It is also 
assumed that policymakers and participants in fi nancial markets fully understand the forces 
shaping the economic outlook whereas the expect ations of households and firms are formed 
using more limited information.

model’s specification is of lit tle consequence in this case  because long-run inflation 
expectations are already aligned with both ac tual inflation and the inflation goal, as 
they were in the May extended Greenbook base line.  By contrast, with an inflation 
goal of 1½ percent (the left-hand set of ch arts), the optimal funds rate rises to above 
6 percent over the next few quarters and th en declines to just above 3½ percent  
by 2012.  Core inflation beyond 2008 stay s lower than in the May Bluebook, but  
this difference is mainly due to the revise d specification of the FRB/US model.   
In particular, if the May optimal-control policy is re-computed using the new model 
specification reflecting more rapid adjustme nt in long-run inflation expectations 
(dashed lines), core inflation descends more  quickly toward the 1½ percent goal than 
was shown in the May Bluebook, accompanie d by a virtually identical path for  
the unemployment rate.  Another factor in fluencing inflation dynamics, the degree  
of global integration in product markets, is discussed in the box on “International 
Dimensions of Monetary Policy.”  
(14) As shown in Chart 6, the current level of the real funds rate, 3.3 percent,  
is identical to the Greenbook-consistent estimate of short-run r*—the value of the 
real federal funds rate that would put the le vel of real GDP at that of its potential 
twelve quarters ahead—and 100 basis point s or more higher than the three model-
based estimates of short-run r*.  The Greenbook-consistent and model-based r* differ 
because the former incorporates the staff’s judgment on current-quarter data and 
forces not captured in the three models—inc luding staff projections of conditioning 
factors that differ from the automated pr ojections used by the three models.   
The Greenbook-consistent measure has been marked up about 20 basis points over 
the intermeeting period, largely in response to incoming data pointing to somewhat 
stronger consumption, business fixed in vestment, and net exports.  Model-based 
estimates of medium-run r*—the value of the real funds rate consistent with keeping

A number of channels have been suggested through which the increased mobility of goods, capital, and labor may alter the economic landscape in which monetary policy operates, and the staff routinely takes these considerations into account in its current analysis and projections.  As an example of such a channel, in a more open economy, imports may better serve as a “release valve’’ for excess aggregate demand, damping its effects on output and inflation.  This box explores these issues using SIGMA, a multi-country dynamic stochastic general e quilibrium model used for policy 
analysis developed in the Divisi on of International Finance.   
SIGMA is sufficiently rich in behavioral and sectoral detail to encompass a variety of mechanisms through which increased global integration can alter the dynamic prop erties of the macroeconomy.   
Based on work by Erceg, Gust, and Lopez-Salido, this box presents an analysis of how greater openness in product markets can alter the effects of domestic and foreign aggregate demand shocks on the U.S. economy and highlights the implications of these changes for the conduct of monetary policy.
1 
 Consider the macroeconomic effects of a persistent 1 percent autonomous rise in domestic a ggregate demand in alternative 
specifications of the model that differ only in the degree of trade openness.  In each of the four panels to the right, the benchmark specification (solid line) corresponds to a trade share—the average of exports and imports—calibrated in the model to 14 percent of output, roughly in line with current U.S. data.  In contrast, in the nearly closed scenario (dashed red line) trade accounts for only 5 percent of domestic output, close to the U.S. trade share of about forty years ago.  Finally, under the specification with higher openness (dotted blue line) this share climbs to 25 percent, roughly around the recent experience of  the United Kingdom and, 
conceivably, the degree of U.S. trade openness in a few decades if 
global integration continues its post-World War II pace.   In all three specifications, increased domestic spending prompts monetary policy to tighten, causing real interest rates to rise (first panel).  The combination of higher real interest rates and an induced appreciation of the dollar (not shown) limits the initial expansion of output and helps bring it back to baseline, in part through a decline in the trade balance (fourth panel).  However, consumer price inflation rises (third panel) because the Taylor rule employed in these simulations does not tighten policy enough to keep output (second panel) from expanding above potential.

As can been seen in the comparis on of these three specifications in 
the previous page, the degree of openness affects the magnitude of 
the U.S. economy’s response to domestic shocks.  With greater openness, more of the increase in  aggregate demand is satisfied 
through higher imports, implying a larger deterioration in the trade balance, a smaller increase in GDP, and less pressure on domestic resources.  Furthermore, the appreciation of the dollar reduces U.S. import prices, and with a larger share of trade in output, the 
resulting downward pressure on domestic prices is magnified.  Accordingly, increased global integration of product markets helps monetary policy to stabilize the economy in the face of domestic spending shocks, as smaller hikes in interest rates are needed to keep output close to potential and to contain inflationary pressures.  
 Increased openness, however, may also make the economy more vulnerable to external shocks.  The response to a 1 percent autonomous increase in foreign aggregate demand is shown in the four panels on this page.  Under all three calibrations, the combination of higher foreign activity and an induced depreciation of the dollar (as foreign interest rates rise relative to U.S. rates) stimulate U.S. real net exports , causing both U.S. output and 
inflation to rise.  The boost in exports is clearly more substantial the greater the openness of the economy, which also amplifies the effect of higher import prices on aggregate inflation.  Thus, not 
surprisingly, greater openness magn ifies the effects on the domestic 
economy of an expansion in foreign aggregate demand, and requires a tighter monetary policy stance to keep inflation contained.    Overall, these model simulations suggest that increased trade openness is likely to have modest, though noticeable, implications for how domestic shocks affect U.S. real activity and inflation. These simulations also highlight the extent to which openness increases the susceptibility of the economy to foreign developments.

output at potential at a seven-year horizon—are both around 2¼ percent, just above 
the TIPS-based measure of about 2.1 percent. (15) The upper panels of Chart 7 depict model- and market-based assessments 
of the monetary policy outlook through the end of 2012.  In the absence of shocks, 
the estimated outcome-based policy rule pres cribes a funds rate path that declines 
gradually to about 4 percent.  Stochastic simulations of the FRB/US model indicate  
a 70 percent probability that the prescriptions  of the outcome-based rule will fall  
in a range between 2½ and 6½ percent duri ng 2012.  Relative to these simulations, 
information from both in- and out-of-the-money interest rate caps suggests that 
investors see less uncertainty but more downside skewness regarding the prospective path of policy at longer horizons (see box entitled “Assessing the Implied 
Distribution of Funds Rates at Longer Ho rizons using Interest Rate Caps”).   
In contrast to the outcome-based rule, Ta ylor rules prescribe a lower funds rate  
path for the near term than in the May Bl uebook, reflecting a decrea se in the forecast 
of the core PCE inflation rate for the current quarter. 
Short-Run Policy Alternatives 
(16) This Bluebook presents three poli cy alternatives for the Committee’s 
consideration, summarized in Table 1.  Under Alternative A, the Committee lowers 
the target federal funds rate 25 basis points to 5 percent.  Alternative B maintains the 
target for the federal funds rate at 5¼  percent.  Alternative C envisions the 
Committee tightening by 25 basi s points, to bring the target rate to 5½ percent.  As 
for the wording of the statement, economic growth appears to have rebounded in the 
second quarter from its anemic first-quarter  pace.  Accordingly, the reference in the 
previous statement indicating that “economic growth slowed in the first part of the 
year” is updated in all three alternatives to  indicate that the economy appears to have 
expanded at a moderate pace so far this ye ar.  This assessment is intended to smooth

ExtenExad fall Assessing the Implied Distribution of Funds Rates at Longer Horizons using 
Interest Rate Caps 
 
The degree of uncertainty around the expected path of the federal funds rate can be assessed 
using implied volatilities derived from intere st rate options.  Beginning with the January 
Bluebook, prices on interest rate caps, which are sequences of call options on three-month 
LIBOR, have been used to construct the c onfidence intervals for the funds rate shown 
through 2012 in Chart 7.1  Until this Bluebook, those estima tes have been based solely on 
price quotes for at-the-money options, and fo llowing convention, it was assumed that 
interest rates were log-normally distributed.  By construction, the estimated distribution of 
interest rates was skewed somewh at toward higher rates.   
 
Recently, Board staff have analyzed in- and ou t-of-the-money interest rate caps to obtain 
information on the possible skew in the di stribution of short-term interest rates.2  This 
analysis is broadly similar to the constructi on of the distribution of the expected federal 
funds rate six months ahead derived from opti ons on Eurodollar futures that is shown in 
Chart 1.  Based on interest rate caps, the sta ff can now calculate risk-neutral, non-parametric 
probability density functions of future short-te rm rates from the near term to very distant 
horizons and monitor the width and skew of these distributions.    These estimates generally suggest that the assu mption that interest rates are log-normally 
distributed results in an underestimation of th e weight market participants put on very low 
rates.  Over the last two years , the lower bound of the 90 pe rcent confidence band about six 
years hence based on these density functions  has been about 70 b asis points below that 
derived from confidence intervals un der the log-normal assumption.

2. Economic growth slowed in the first 
part of the year and the adjustment 
in the housing sector is ongoing.  
Nevertheless, the economy seems 
likely to expand at a moderate pace 
over coming quarters. So far this year, the economy appears 
to have grown at a moderate pace and 
seems likely to continue to do so over 
coming quarters .  But ongoing 
weakness in the housing sector implies a significant risk that economic activity 
might grow more slowly than 
anticipated.  So far this year, the economy appears 
to have grown at a moderate pace 
despite the ongoing adjustment in the 
housing sector.  The economy seems  
likely to  continue to  expand at a 
moderate pace over coming quarters. Despite the ongoing adjustment in 
the housing sector, the economy 
appears to have grown at a 
moderate pace so far this year.  The 
economy seems  likely to  continue to  
expand at a moderate pace over 
coming quarters. 
Rationale 3. Core inflation remains somewhat 
elevated.  Although inflation 
pressures seem likely to moderate 
over time, the high level of resource 
utilization has the potential to 
sustain those pressures. 
 Core inflation has edged lower in 
recent months and is expected to 
remain moderate over the next year or 
so.  However , the high level of 
resource utilization has the potential to 
add to  inflation  pressures going 
forward . Readings on core inflation have 
improved modestly in recent months.  
However, the high level of resource 
utilization has the potential to sustain 
inflation  pressures. 
 Although readings on core inflation 
have improved mode stly in recent 
months , core inflation remains  
somewhat elevated.  Inflation 
pressures seem likely to moderate 
over time, but considerable 
uncertainty surrounds that judgment.  Moreover, the high level 
of resource utilization,  in 
combination with earlier increases 
in the prices of energy and other 
commodities, has the potential to 
sustain those pressures. 
Assessment 
of Risk 4. In these circumstances, the Committee’s predominant policy 
concern remains the risk that 
inflation will fail to moderate as 
expected.  Future policy adjustments 
will depend on the evolution of the 
outlook for both inflation and 
economic growth, as implied by 
incoming information. With this policy action, the Committee 
judges that the downside risk to 
economic growth now roughly 
balances the upside risk to inflation.   
Future policy adjust ments will depend 
on the evolution of the outlook for 
both inflation and economic growth, 
as implied by incoming information. 
 In these circumstances, the Committee’s predominant policy 
concern is the risk that the moderation 
in inflation will fail to  be sustained .  
Future policy adjust ments will depend

through the quarterly variation that has largel y been driven by transitory factors.  Core 
inflation data for recent months have been  benign, with the twelve-month change in 
the core PCE deflator dropping to 2 percent in April for the first time since March of 
last year.  The draft language for all thre e alternatives acknowledges these favorable 
readings, but the alternatives differ notab ly in their assessment of inflation going 
forward.  As usual, the Committee could consider combining elements from more 
than one alternative.   
(17) If the Committee continues to view the current policy stance as likely to 
foster a return of output to potential and sustain the recent moderation of inflation, as 
in the staff forecast, then it may wish to choose Alternative B , under which the 
federal funds rate is maintained at 5¼ percen t.  In the staff analysis underlying the 
Greenbook forecast, the real federal funds rate  is seen as near its equilibrium value 
(Chart 6), suggesting that the current stance of policy is likely to reduce pressures on 
resources over time.  Additionally, the current target for the funds rate is very close to 
prescriptions for near-term policy obtained from optimal policy simulations with a 
2 percent inflation goal (Chart 5) and some  of the policy rules shown in Chart 7.  
While financial conditions tightened subs tantially over the intermeeting period, 
Committee members may view this developm ent as merely bringing forward an 
adjustment they had anticipated would occu r before long, suggesting that no policy 
offset is necessary.  The Committee might also judge that maintaining its current 
policy stance for the time being would provid e a reasonable weighting of the risks that 
weakness in housing could eventually ha ve a more pronounced effect on overall 
economic activity and that the recent modera tion in inflation could prove temporary. 
(18) The draft statement accompanying Alternative B reiterates the view that the 
economy seems likely to expand at a modera te pace over coming quarters.  Following 
benign inflation readings, the draft langua ge drops both the characterization of the 
level of core inflation as “somewhat elevat ed” and the prediction that inflation seems 
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)
Page 22 of 42
likely to moderate from its current level.  Instead, the statement acknowledges the 
recent favorable information while expressing the view that the high level of resource 
utilization has the potential to sustain pr ice pressures.  This language would be 
intended to indicate that incoming data point  to a slowing in core inflation but, given 
that monthly inflation readings are noisy, to  suggest that the Committee is awaiting 
more data before being satisfied that the mo deration in inflation will be sustained.  
The statement would conclude by indicati ng that the Committee’s predominant policy 
concern remains the upside risk to infl ation, with the language modified for 
consistency with the inflation paragraph. 
(19) Market participants do not expect a chan ge in the funds rate at this meeting 
and judging from the Desk’s survey of pr imary dealers, most expect only minor 
modifications to the text of the accompan ying statement.  The revisions to the 
inflation paragraph under Alternative B would likely garner considerable attention.  
Investors would not overlook the deletion of the “somewhat elevated” language and 
would probably infer that the Committee believes that its prior expectation for 
moderating core inflation is on track.  Partic ularly in light of the revisions to the risk 
assessment, markets might also interpret th e overall statement as signaling that the 
Committee finds 2 percent to be an accepta ble level of core in flation.  Market 
participants would most likely mark down their expectations for the path of the 
federal funds rate.  Equities would rally, an d the foreign exchange value of the dollar 
would depreciate.  Long-term bond yields mi ght edge lower, but that fall could be 
tempered, or even reversed, if the statemen t led investors to mar k up their long-run 
inflation expectations.   
(20) The large rise in real yields and the resilience of equity markets over the 
intermeeting period could be interpreted as  an indication that investors have marked 
up their growth expectations, anticipa te greater pressures on resources, and 
correspondingly expect a more restrictive stance of policy.  In deed, judging from 
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)
Page 23 of 42
options on Eurodollar futures, investors no w place about one-third odds on monetary 
policy tightening within the next year.  Under this interpretation, there is a risk that if 
investors come to perceive resource markets  as taut and do not see the Committee 
adopting a more restrictive policy, then inflat ion expectations could continue to rise.  
If the Committee is especially concerned by  this risk, it might prefer to tighten 
25 basis points at this meeting, as in Alternative C .  Raising the funds rate at this 
meeting might be seen as the best way to mi tigate the risk of an updrift in inflation 
expectations and reassure markets that th e Committee will indeed tighten as necessary 
to keep inflation contained.  Members may  also be concerned about the possibility 
that increases in energy and commodity pri ces could lead to greater price pressures 
than currently foreseen by the staff.  Moreover, the optimal policy path shown in 
Chart 5 indicates that policy would need to  be tightened about 1 percentage point 
over the next year should the Committee wish to bring inflation down to 1½ percent. 
(21) The statement accompanying Alternative C could reiterate the assessment 
that the economy seems likely to expand at a moderate pace while reordering the 
clauses in order to underscore the view th at the adjustment in the housing sector 
appears unlikely to derail the economic expansion.  The inflation paragraph would de-
emphasize the recent monthly price data and retain the explicit acknowledgement that 
the level of core inflation remains some what elevated, which many investors would 
read as a signal that the Committee prefers a co re inflation rate of around 1½ percent.  
The Committee’s concern about the inflation outlook could be stressed by noting that 
“considerable uncertainty” surrounds the assessment that inflation is likely to 
moderate and also by expanding the set of factors that could sustain inflation 
pressures to include the pass-through from higher prices of energy and other commodities.  The statement could conclude by  noting that, even after the increase in 
the funds rate, the Committee’s predominant policy concern remains the upside risk 
to inflation. 
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)
Page 24 of 42
(22) A tightening of monetary policy at this meeting would take financial 
markets aback.  Short-term interest rates and option-implied volatility of money 
market rates would surely rise.  However, inflation compensation and distant-horizon 
forward yields could well fall as the announcement would likely lower long-run 
inflation expectations.  The net effect on long-term yields is thus ambiguous.  The 
foreign exchange value of the dollar woul d probably appreciate, and equity prices 
would likely decline. 
(23) Against the backdrop of the recent sharp rise in interest rates and an already 
weak housing market and following a number  of benign inflation readings, members 
may feel that the risk of unacceptably sluggish economic growth is now greater than 
the upside risk to inflation.  If so, th e Committee might wish to lower the target 
federal funds rate by 25 basis points as in Alternative A .  The Committee might view 
the recent backup in long-term yields as owing mainly to an exogenous rebound in 
term premiums from an abnormally low leve l.  A rising term premium could dampen 
consumer and business spending and further weaken the housing market, a possibility 
explored in the Greenbook alternative simula tion “Tighter financial conditions.”  In 
light of this possibility, the Committee may believe that a lower federal funds rate is 
required to maintain the desired strength of  aggregate demand.  Furthermore, with 
low unemployment not clearly boosting la bor costs, the Committee might think that 
the NAIRU could well be lower than currently estimated by the staff—as in the 
“lower NAIRU” Greenbook alternative scenario .  In this case, it may judge that a 
slightly more accommodative stance of monetary policy would run little risk of stoking inflationary pressures, especially si nce the real funds rate is now above the 
range of model-based estimates of its equilibrium.    (24) The statement in Alternative A woul d continue to note that the economy 
seems most likely to expand at a moderate  pace.  But the Committee may perceive the 
downside risk to that forecast emanating from the housing sector as being greater 
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)
Page 25 of 42
than it was in May, owing to the backup in  mortgage interest rates.  Accordingly, the 
draft language highlights this risk by placin g it in a separate sentence at the end of the 
second paragraph and by pointing explicitly  to “ongoing weakness” in the housing 
sector rather than “ongoing adjustment.”  In the inflation paragraph, the reference to 
core inflation being elevated would be de leted and replaced by the assessment that 
core inflation has edged lower and is likely to remain moderate, implicitly placing 
considerable weight on the recent inflati on news.  The statement could conclude by 
noting that even after the 25 basis point ea sing, the downside risk to the Committee’s 
growth objective is roughly offset by the upsi de risk to its inflation objective, and that 
future policy adjustments will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both 
inflation and economic growth. 
(25) An easing of monetary policy at this  meeting would come  as a complete 
surprise to investors, particularly in the wake of the recent jump in policy 
expectations.  Short-term interest rates would fall appreciably and option-implied 
volatility in fixed-income markets would rise .  The effect on longer-term interest rates 
is less clear.  Investors might interpre t the announcement as signaling that the 
economy is weaker than they had previously thought, driving long-term yields down.  
Alternatively, the announcement might lead investors to mark up their expectations 
for inflation and to demand a larger inflati on risk premium, boosting long-term yields.  
The effects on equity markets and the fo reign-exchange value of the dollar are 
likewise ambiguous, depending on how investor s update their forecasts for inflation 
and growth in light of the surprise decision. 
Money and Debt Forecasts 
(26) Under the Greenbook forecast, M2 is  projected to expand about 
5½ percent this year and 5 percent next yea r, as in the May forecast.  Opportunity

year, as deposit rates continue to catch up wi th earlier increases in short-term interest 
rates, and accordingly M2 grows a little faster  than nominal GDP.  In the forecast, 
ongoing rapid growth in retail money funds offsets more sluggish expansion in small 
time deposits and currency. 
(27) The growth rate of domestic nonfinanci al sector debt is projected to fall 
from 8 percent last year to 6¾ percent in  2007 and 5¾ percent in 2008.  Corporate 
borrowing is predicted to slow later this year.  In the househol d sector, flat house 
prices, rising interest rates, and tightening credit standards are all expected to weigh 
on mortgage borrowing.

Directive and Balance of  Risks Statement  
(28) Draft language for the directive and draf t risk assessments identical to those 
presented in Table 1 are provided below. 
Directive Wording 
The Federal Open Market Committ ee seeks monetary and financial 
conditions that will foster price st ability and promote sustainable growth 
in output.  To further its long-r un objectives, the Committee in the 
immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with 
maintaining/INCREASING/ REDUCING the federal funds rate at/TO 
an average of around ________ 5¼  percent.  
Risk Assessments  
 A.   With this policy action, the Commi ttee judges that the downside risk to 
economic growth now roughly balances the upside risk to inflation.  
Future policy adjustments will depe nd on the evolution of the outlook 
for both inflation and economic gr owth, as implied by incoming 
information.  
 B.   In these circumstances, the Co mmittee’s predominant policy concern is 
the risk that the moderation in inflati on will fail to be sustained.  Future 
policy adjustments will depend on th e evolution of the outlook for both 
inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information. 
 C.   Even after this action, th e Committee’s predominant policy concern 
remains the risk that inflation will fa il to moderate as expected.  Future 
policy adjustments will depend on th e evolution of the outlook for both 
inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information.

Appendix A: Measures of the  Equilibrium Real Rate 
 
The equilibrium real rate is the real  federal funds rate that, if mainta ined, would be projected to return 
output to its potential level over time.   The short-run equilibrium rate is  defined as the rate that would 
close the output gap in twelve qua rters given the corresponding model’ s projection of the economy.   
The medium-run concept is the value of  the real federal funds rate proj ected to keep ou tput at potential 
in seven years, under the assumption that monetary policy acts to bring actua l and potential output into 
line in the short run and then keeps them equal thereafter.  The TIPS-based factor model measure 
provides an estimate of market expectations for the real federal funds rate seven years ahead.  
 
The actual real federal funds rate is  constructed as the difference betw een the nominal rate and realized 
inflation, where the nominal rate is measured as the quarterly average of the observed federal funds rate, 
and realized inflation is given by the log difference between the co re PCE price index and its lagged 
value four quarters earlier.  For th e current quarter, the nominal rate is specified as the target federal 
funds rate on the Bluebook publication date.  For the current quarter and th e previous quarter, the 
inflation rate is computed using the sta ff’s estimate of the core PCE price index. 
 
Confidence intervals reflect uncer tainties about model specification, coefficients, and the level of 
potential output.  The final column of the table in dicates the values published in the previous Bluebook. 
  
Measure Description 
Single-equation 
Model   The measure of the equilibrium real rate in the single-equation model is based on an 
estimated aggregate-demand relationship between  the current value of the output gap and 
its lagged values as well as the lagged va lues of the real federal funds rate. 
Small Structural 
Model  The small-scale model of the economy consists of equations for five variables: the output 
gap, the equity premium, the federal budget surp lus, the trend growth rate of output, and 
the real bond yield. 
Large Model 
(FRB/US)  Estimates of the equilibrium real rate using FRB/US—the staff’s large-scale econometric 
model of the U.S. economy—depend on a very broad array of economic factors, some of 
which take the form of projected valu es of the model’s exogenous variables. 
Greenbook-
consistent  The FRB/US model is used in conjunction with an extended version of the Greenbook 
forecast to derive a Greenbook-consistent measure .  FRB/US is first add-factored so that 
its simulation matches the extended Greenbook forecast, and then a second simulation is 
run off this baseline to determine the value of  the real federal funds rate that closes the 
output gap. 
TIPS-based 
Factor Model Yields on TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) reflect investors’ expectations of 
the future path of real interest rates, but also include term and liquidity premiums.  The 
TIPS-based measure of the equilibrium real ra te is constructed using the seven-year-ahead 
instantaneous real forward rate derived fro m TIPS yields as of the Bluebook publication 
date.  This forward rate is adjusted to remove estimates of the term and liquidity 
premiums based on a three-factor arbitrage -free term-structure model applied to TIPS 
yields, nominal yields, and inflation.  Because TIPS indexation is based on the total CPI, 
this measure is also adjusted for the me dium-term difference—projected at 40 basis 
points—between total CPI inflation and core PCE inflation.

Appendix B: Analysis of Policy Paths and Confidence Intervals 
 
Rule Specifications :  For the following rules, it denotes the federal funds rate for quarter t, while  
the explanatory variables include the staff’s projec tion of trailing four-quart er core PCE inflation ( πt), 
inflation two and three quarters ahead ( πt+2|t and πt+3|t), the output gap in the current period and one 
quarter ahead (*
ttyy−  and *
1| 1|tt ttyy++− ), and the three-quarter-ahead forecast of annual average GDP 
growth relative to potential (44*
3| 3|tt ttyy++Δ− Δ ), and *π denotes an assumed value of policymakers’ 
long-run inflation objective.  The outcome-based a nd forecast-based rules were estimated using real-
time data over the sample 1988:1-2006:4; each specifi cation was chosen using th e Bayesian information 
criterion. Each rule incorporates a 75 basis point shift in the interc ept, specified as a sequence of  
25 basis point increments during the first three qu arters of 1998.  The first two simple rules were 
proposed by Taylor (1993, 1999), while  the third is a vari ant of the Taylor ( 1999) rule—introduced  
in the August Bluebook—with  a higher value of r*.  The prescriptions of the first-difference rule do  
not depend on assumptions regarding r* or the level of the output  gap; see Orphanides (2003). 
 
Outcome-based rule it =  1.20i t-1–0.39i t-2+0.19[1.17  + 1.73 πt  + 3.66(*

Taylor (1999) rule     
with higher r* it = 2.75 + πt + 0.5(πt – *π) + (*
ttyy− )  
First-difference rule it = i t-1 + 0.5(πt+3|t –*π) + 0.5(44*
3| 3|tt ttyy+ + Δ− Δ ) 
 
FRB/US Model Simulations :  Prescriptions from the two empiri cal rules are computed using dynamic 
simulations of the FRB/US model, implemented as though the rule were followe d starting at this FOMC 
meeting.  The dotted line labeled “Previous Bluebook” is  based on the current specification of the policy 
rule, applied to the previous Gr eenbook projection.  Confidence inte rvals are based on stochastic 
simulations of the FRB/US model with shocks drawn from the estimated residuals over 1986-2005.  
Information from Financial Markets :  The expected funds rate pa th is based on forward rate 
agreements, and the confidence intervals for this path are constructed using prices of interest rate caps. 
Near-Term Prescriptions of Simple Policy Rules :  These prescriptions ar e calculated using Greenbook 
projections for inflation and the out put gap. Because the first-difference rule involves the lagged funds 
rate, the value labeled “Previous Bluebook” for the curr ent quarter is computed using the actual value  
of the lagged funds rate, and the one -quarter-ahead prescriptions are ba sed on this rule’s prescription for 
the current quarter.

Inflation Indicator Based on M2
Note: P* is defined to equal M2 times V* divided by potential GDP. V*, or long-run velocity, is estimated
using average velocity over the 1959:Q1-to-1989:Q4 period and then, after a break, over the interval from
1993:Q1 to the present. For the forecast period, P* is based on the staff M2 forecast and P is simulated using a
short-run dynamic model relating P to P*. Blue areas indicate periods in which P* is notably less than P.
Gray areas denote the projection period.1965 1968 1971 1974 1977 1980 1983 1986 1989 1992 1995 1998 2001 2004 2007 40 60 80100120140Ratio scale Price Level
