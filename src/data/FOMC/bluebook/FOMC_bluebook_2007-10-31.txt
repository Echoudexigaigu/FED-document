MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES  
Recent Developments 
Summary 
(1) Financial market functioning improved somewhat over the intermeeting 
period, but conditions in a number of mar kets remained strained.  Market interest 
rates declined and the expected path of th e federal funds rate shifted down following 
the FOMC’s decision at its Sept ember meeting to lower the target federal funds rate 
by 50 basis points.  Amid mixed economic data  releases and some worsening of credit 
concerns, yields moved down a bit further,  on balance, over the remainder of the 
period.  In longer-term corporate market s, investment- and speculative-grade bond 
spreads narrowed somewhat over the peri od as a whole.  Bond issuance by 
investment-grade firms continued to be st rong, a few LBO-related bonds were issued 
for the first time since early summer, and underwriters were able to syndicate a 
portion of a few large LBO-related loans to nonbank lenders.  In housing finance, the 
spread between offer rates on prime jumb o fixed-rate mortgages and conforming 
loans declined a bit, but remained elevated.  Issuance of securities backed by subprime 
mortgages stayed low, while issuance of those backed by prime jumbo mortgages 
appears to have increased only modestly.  Respondents to the October Senior Loan 
Officer Opinion Survey reported having ti ghtened standards and terms on many types 
of loans over the past three months.  Th e exchange value of the dollar moved lower 
over the intermeeting period, and broad stock price indexes increased, on net, despite 
some recent sharp sell-offs.

Monetary Policy Expectations and Treasury Yields 
(2) The FOMC’s decision at its Septembe r 18 meeting to lower the target 
federal funds rate by 50 basis points to 4¾ percent prompted a decline in market 
interest rates, as investors apparently had attached substantial odds to a smaller policy 
move.1  The subsequent publication of the minutes of the September meeting left 
little imprint in financial markets.  The an ticipated path of monetary policy moved 
down somewhat further, on net, over the remainder of the period in response to 
mixed economic data releases and some wors ening of credit concerns (Chart 1).  
Market quotes indicate that investors currently assign about 60 percent probability to 
a 25 basis point easing at the October meeting and nearly 30 percent probability to a larger easing move.  Investors appear to expect about a 100 basis point cumulative 
reduction in the target federal funds rate by the end of 2008—about 35 basis points more than just before the September meeting.   With regard to the statement language, 
respondents to the Desk’s survey of pri mary dealers, conducted between October 18 
and October 22, were about equally divi ded between those expecting the Committee 
to judge that downside risks to growth  are now the predominant policy concern; 
those anticipating a balanced risk assessmen t; and those expecting the Committee, as 
in September, to offer no explicit assessment of risk.  Measures of uncertainty around the future funds rate path derived from opti on prices were little changed, on net, over 
                                          
 
1 The effective federal funds rate averaged 4.75 percent over the intermeeting period.  
During the period, the federal funds rate w as more volatile than usual.  The intraday 
standard deviation averaged 22 basis points, considerably higher than the 7 basis point 
average for the year through the end of July.  The funds rate continued to show a tendency 
to soften over the course of the day, reporte dly reflecting in part strong demand for funds 
from European banks during morning trading.  The root mean squared deviation of the daily 
effective federal funds rate from the target also  was higher than its av erage between the start 
of the year and the end of July.  Over the peri od, the Desk did not purchase any securities 
outright.  The volume of long-term RPs remained at $12 billion.

the intermeeting period, and the distribution of federal funds rates at six- and twelve-
month horizons remained skewed to the downside. (3) Consistent with the revision in policy expectations, two-year nominal 
Treasury yields fell 35 basis points, on net, over the intermeeting period, while ten-year nominal yields declined 10 basis points.  Despite a marked rise in spot oil prices, 
TIPS-based inflation compensation was abou t unchanged.  Measures of short- and 
long-term inflation expectations from the Reuters-Michigan survey ticked down in 
October.  
Money Markets       
(4) Conditions in money markets appear to have improved a bit during the 
intermeeting period, with much of the im provement coming on the heels of the 
September policy easing.  In the United St ates, spreads on asset-backed commercial 
paper (ABCP) and on lower-rated unsecured commercial paper declined, on balance, but remained above their July levels.  Outs tanding ABCP has continued to contract, 
albeit at a slower pace than in August, wh ereas unsecured paper has expanded so far 
in October (Chart 2).  A proposal by a cons ortium of large banks to create a Master 
Liquidity Enhanced Conduit that would purc hase sound assets of some SIV conduits 
as a means of avoiding asset “fire sales” met with mixed reviews from other market participants.  The volume of ABCP issued in Europe appeared to stabilize in early October, but declined again late in the in termeeting period.  In Canada, the deadline 
for final agreement on restructuring ou tstanding ABCP was extended two more 
months to mid-December.  Conditions in term bank funding markets eased a little 
over the intermeeting period, although some signs of year-end pressures emerged.  (See box “Early Indications of Year-end Pressures.”)  Spreads of term libor and 
federal funds rates over comparable overnight index swap rates stepped down after the September FOMC meeting, but they remained wide by historical standards.

Funding reportedly was available at somewhat  longer maturities than in August and 
early September.  In European interbank money markets, spreads narrowed 
substantially at the shortest maturities and more modestly at longer maturities.  The 
functioning of the foreign exchange swap market impr oved somewhat over the 
period, but has not yet returned to pre-crisis conditions. 
  Early Indications of Year-end Pressures  
 In recent years, year-end pressures in money markets have been muted.  This year, the 
extent of year-end pressures is difficult to gaug e because diminished liquidity in term funding  
markets complicates the interpretation of forward rates.  Nonetheless, there are some signs of 
year-end pressures in interbank funding markets.  The spread of the one-month forward libor 
rate ending three months hence over the corresponding one-month forward Overnight Indexed Swap (OIS) rate—a measure that encompasses the year-end—is currently over 90 basis points.      In contrast, the adjacent one-month forward spreads covering intervals ending two and four months hence ―and thus excluding the year-end ―are both around 55 basis points.  Moreover, the 
gap between the one-month forward libor-OIS sp reads ending two and three months hence 
widened around the time that the maturity date on a three-month deposit crossed into the new year.  This development could reflect an increa sed premium that borrowers in the libor market 
are willing to pay in order to secure funding ov er year-end.  Moreover, the expectation that the 
Desk will supply generous reserves to avoid a spike in the effective federal funds rate on the last day of the year acts to keep the OIS rate from drifting higher.  Market participants in the commercial paper market have expressed some concerns about year-end pressures.  However, 
direct evidence on such pressures in the CP mark et is scarce because very little lower-grade 
commercial paper has been issued that matures beyond the end of December.

(5) Flows to prime money market mutual funds, which invest heavily in 
commercial paper, were robust over the intermeeting period, while government-only 
funds registered only small net inflows.  Fu nctioning in the Treasury bill market has 
improved some since the September FOMC meeting, but continues to show signs of 
pressure; bill lending from the SOMA por tfolio was heavy at times.  Bid-asked 
spreads in the interdealer market for Trea sury bills reportedly remain somewhat 
elevated, though less so than in August .  The thinness of the market has been 
exacerbated by paydowns of Treasury bills in recent weeks follo wing the receipt of 
September tax payments.  Day-to-day movements in bill yields have been outsized at 
times, and yields on three-month bills declined about 20 basis points, on net, over the 
period.   
Capital Markets 
(6) Conditions in corporate bond mark ets improved somewhat over the 
intermeeting period.  Spreads on longer-t erm investment- and speculative-grade 
bonds narrowed as much as 20 and 60 basis poi nts, respectively, over the first part of 
the intermeeting period, but they widened more recently to end the period down 
about 15 basis points, on net.  Investment -grade corporate bond issuance was strong 
in September and early October, and speculati ve-grade issuance has picked up notably 
this month.  For the first time since early summer, a few LBO-related bonds were 
issued.  Conditions also appear to have im proved a bit in the leveraged loan market.  
An index of credit default swap spread s on leveraged syndicated loans (the LCDX) 
fell 20 basis points, on balance, and s econdary market credit spreads on the most 
liquid loans reportedly narrowed some.  The pipeline of underwritten leveraged loans 
that have not yet been syndicated, which includes some large LBO deals, remained 
substantial.  However, underwriters were able  to sell portions of a few of these loans 
to institutional investors, including traditio nal loan investors such as mutual funds, 
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)
7 of 44
pension funds, and collateralized loan obligations (CLOs), but also hedge funds and 
bank proprietary desks.  The syndications of these deals were reportedly followed very closely by market participants, partly becaus e they could serve as a template for sales 
of other large deals that are still in the pipeline.  However, new issuance of CLOs, 
which provided much of the demand for leveraged loans in recent years, remained well below the pace observed during the first two quarters of the year.  On net, broad stock price indexes rose 2 to 4 percent despit e some sharp sell-offs in the latter part of 
the intermeeting period.  Outside the financ ial sector, earnings generally exceeded 
expectations.  For financial firms, however, earnings in the third quarter came in 
below analysts’ expectations, reflecting in part substantial write-downs of mortgage-related assets and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs).  Options-implied volatility 
on the S&P 500 declined, on net, ov er the period.         
(7) Markets for nonconforming home mort gages showed little improvement 
over the intermeeting period:  The spread  between offer rates on prime jumbo fixed-
rate mortgages and comparable conforming loans stayed elevated, and securitization 
activity for jumbo mortgages appears to have increased modestly.  A significant net 
fraction of respondents to the October Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey reported that their originations of prime jumbo mortgages declined over the past three months compared with the previous three-month period.  Spreads on indexes of credit default 
swaps on subprime mortgages widened notably, and delinquency rates on variable-rate 
subprime mortgages posted a further increa se in August.  Issuance of subprime-
mortgage-backed securities remained weak  through mid-October.  Considerable 
fractions of respondents to the Octobe r Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey 
indicated that they had tightened lending stan dards on prime as well as nontraditional 
and subprime residential mortgage loans over the past three months.  In contrast, available information suggests that the origination of conforming mortgages has been 
little affected by recent  developments.

Foreign Developments 
(8) As in the United States, conditions in financial markets abroad improved 
noticeably following the FOMC’s decision to  cut the target federal funds rate, but a 
number of foreign markets remain unsettled .  The European Central Bank continued 
to provide substantial amounts of liquidity during the intermeeting period.  The Bank 
of England also added liquidity and allowed banks greater flexibility in meeting their 
target balances.  Equity prices  in major industrial countrie s gained 2 to 5 percent over 
the period, and their implied volatilities declined (Chart 3).  Yields on long-term 
government securities recorded small net changes.  Stock prices in emerging market 
economies, which generally had been less a ffected by the recent financial crisis, 
performed even better in most cases, and EMBI+ spreads for many key emerging 
market economies narrowed. 
(9) The foreign exchange value of the dollar recorded a decline of more than 
3½ percent over the intermeeting period against a trade-weighted index of major 
foreign currencies, with a wide range of moves against individual currencies.2  The 
dollar dropped almost 5½ percent versus the Canadian dollar in response to indications of continued robust Canadian  economic performance and higher prices 
for oil and other commodities.  The U.S. do llar fell below parity with the Canadian 
currency for the first time in more than th irty years.  The dollar declined 3 percent on 
balance against the euro and reached a r ecord low during the period.  The dollar 
moved down somewhat less versus the yen, which appeared to be weakened by the 
re-establishment of yen-funded carry trade positions.  Both the Australian dollar and New Zealand dollar, currencies that are of ten on the other side of carry trades, 
appreciated substantially over the period.  The dollar also declined about 1¾ percent 
against an index of currencies of ou r other important trading partners.

Debt and Money 
(10)  Domestic nonfinancial sector debt is  estimated to have increased at an 
annual rate of 7½ percent in the third quart er, a bit faster than in the second quarter, 
as slower borrowing by households and nonfin ancial businesses was more than offset 
by faster expansion of federal government debt (Chart 4).  Notable net fractions of 
banks reported in the October Senior Lo an Officer Opinion Survey that they had 
tightened lending terms on C&I loans over the previous three months.  (See box 
“Recent Developments at Commercial Banks.”)  Even so, business debt growth remained strong, reflecting robust issuance of investment-grade bonds and the continued surge in C&I lending.  The growth  of C&I loans was partly the result of 
LBO-related financings that underwriters could not syndicate to institutional investors 
ending up on banks’ books.  Household mort gage borrowing is estimated to have 
decelerated again in the third quarter, re flecting further declines in home price 
appreciation and home sales and tighter credit conditions for nonconforming 
mortgages.  In contrast, consumer credit  continued to expand at a moderate pace 
through August.   
(11) M2 advanced at a 5½ percent annual rate in September and October, a 
significant deceleration from the rapid pace experienced in August in the midst of the 
financial market tumult.  After surging in August, liquid deposits contracted in 
September and seem to be growing only modestly in October.  Retail money market 
funds expanded rapidly again last month, and available data for October point to 
continued strong growth.  Small time de posits grew briskly in both months, 
apparently owing in part to relatively attr active rates offered by some institutions on 
such deposits.

Recent Developments in Commercial Banking 
 
Commercial bank credit has grown at a 13 per cent annual rate since the end of July.  
Most of the advance has been accounted for by a surge in C&I loans (left hand chart) 
and loans to nonbank financial institutions  extended by large domestic commercial 
banks and U.S. branches and agencies of fo reign banks.  The increase in these banks’ 
C&I loans has been caused partly by the retention of underwritten LBO-related loans 
that these institutions have not been able to  syndicate.  The jump in loans to financial 
institutions occurred in August and early September and was consistent with reports 
that some banks provided short-term fina ncing to commercial paper conduits and to 
other nonbank financial institutions.  In a ddition, steady expansion of C&I loans at 
smaller banks suggests appreciable underl ying growth in the demand for bank-
intermediated business credit that is unrelated to the dislocations in financial markets.  
Banks have funded the expansion of th eir balance sheets largely with managed 
liabilities, such large time deposits and nondeposit sources, which include Federal Home Loan Bank advances.  Perhaps in an effort to conserve balance sheet capacity, 
large banks shed U.S. housing finance agen cies’ mortgage pass-through securities. The 
October Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey indicated that, on net, banks have 
tightened standards and terms for most categories of loans to businesses and 
households over the past three months, proba bly reflecting in part a desire to manage 
their balance sheet capacity as well as their credit risk. 
 
Profits declined at many large banking companies last quarter, and results often came 
in below analysts’ estimates.  Many of the firms attributed their disappointing earnings 
largely to deteriorating credit quality, particularly in the home mortgage sector, while several of the largest firms also reported significant write-downs on leveraged 
syndicated loans and structured financial prod ucts.  Partly as a result, CDS spreads for 
large banking organizations remained elevat ed over the intermeeting period (right 
hand chart).

Medium-Term Strategies  
(12) To shed additional light on the econom ic outlook and possible monetary 
policy strategies over the medium term , the staff has extended the Greenbook 
forecast beyond 2009 using the FRB/US  model with adjustments to ensure 
consistency with the staff’s a ssessment of longer-run trends.3  This extended forecast 
embeds several key assumptions for the period beyond 2009:  Trend multifactor 
productivity grows 1 percent per year; energy  prices are approximately flat in real 
terms; the real value of the dollar depreciates 1¼ percent per year; and the unified federal budget deficit edges up to 2½ percen t of GDP by 2012.  In the extension, the 
unemployment rate beyond 2009 stays clos e to the staff’s assumed long-run NAIRU 
of 4¾ percent while core PCE inflation remains fairly stable at about 2 percent—a 
rate roughly consistent with recent survey me asures of long-run inflation expectations.  
The real funds rate path consistent with th ese outcomes declines from slightly above 
2¾ percent in 2009 to about 2¼ percent on average in 2011 and 2012. 
(13) As shown in Chart 5, the Greenbook-consistent measure of short-run r*—
the value that would close the output gap ov er the next twelve quarters—has shifted 
up 10 basis points and now stands at 2.9 pe rcent, about the same as the actual real 
federal funds rate.  The three model-based estimates of short-run r* range from  
1.6 to 2.6 percent; on average, these estimat es are a bit lower than in the previous 
Bluebook.
4  The model-based and TIPS-based estimates of medium-run r* range from 
1.9 to 2.4 percent and are little ch anged from the previous Bluebook. 
(14) Chart 6 depicts optimal control simula tions of the FRB/US model using  
the staff’s extension of the Greenbook forecast beyond 2009.  In these simulations,

policymakers place equal weights on keeping core PCE inflation close to a specified 
goal, on keeping unemployment close to  the long-run NAIRU, and on avoiding 
changes in the nominal federal funds rate.5  For an inflation goal of 1½ percent (the 
left-hand set of charts), the optimal contro l simulation prescribes a nominal federal 
funds rate path that rises slightly from about 5¼ percent in the third quarter to 
roughly 5½ percent by the end of 2008 and then declines gradually to a little under  
4 percent by the end of 2012.  With an infl ation goal of 2 percen t (the right-hand set 
of charts), the optimal funds rate gradually falls to a bit under 4½ percent by the end 
of 2012.  The prescription for the trajector y of the funds rate with a 1½ percent 
inflation goal is a little higher than that  shown in the Septembe r Bluebook, reflecting 
the somewhat stronger assessment by the st aff of the outlook for aggregate demand.  
Under either inflation goal, the paths of the unemployment rate and the inflation rate 
over the next few years are a bit lower than those shown in the previous Bluebook, consistent with the revision s to the Greenbook forecast. 
(15) As shown in Chart 7, the outcome-based monetary policy rule (the left 
panel) prescribes a funds rate path that d eclines to around 4½ percent by the middle 
of next year and then rises to about 5 pe rcent near the end of the decade before 
falling back.  This path is about ¼ percenta ge point on average higher than in the 
September Bluebook, reflecting the upward re vision to the projection for real growth, 
and is somewhat above the funds rate path anticipated by financial market participants (the right panel).  Stochastic simulations of  the FRB/US model indicate a 70 percent 
probability that the prescriptions of the outc ome-based rule will fall in a range of  
                                          
 
5  In conducting these simula tions, policymakers and participants in financial markets are 
assumed to understand fully the forces shap ing the economic outlook (as summarized by  
the extended Greenbook projection), whereas hou seholds and firms form their expectations 
using more limited information.  In this Bluebo ok, the current quarter is the first period of 
the simulation for which a value for the nominal funds rate different from that embedded in 
the extended Greenbook projection is permitted.

3½ to 5¾ percent at the end of next year.6  Interest rate caps suggest a broadly similar 
degree of uncertainty in financial markets regarding the prospective path of policy 
over the next several years, with a 70 percent confidence interval of about 2½ to 4¾ 
percent at the end of 2008. 
(16) For an inflation goal of either 1½ percent or 2 percent, the near-term 
prescriptions of simple policy rules gene rally point to additional policy easing, 
although the Taylor (1999) rule with a higher r* and the first difference rule with an 
inflation goal of 1½ percent both sugges t a slightly tighter policy stance.  The 
prescriptions of the Taylor (1993) rule are virtually unchanged from those of the previous Bluebook, reflecting the offsetting influences of a slightly higher output gap 
and slightly lower core inflation.  Beca use the Taylor (1999) rule responds more 
aggressively to output gaps, the prescripti ons from this rule—and the variant with  
a higher intercept—have been revised up more noticeably, about 15 basis points.   
The first-difference rule responds to three- quarter-ahead projections of four-quarter 
core inflation and GDP growth relative to  potential; the prescriptions from this  
rule are little changed for an inflation goal of 1½ percent and are up a notch for  
an inflation goal of 2 percent.

Economic Outlook through 2009 
(17) Reflecting incoming economic data that  were, on balance, stronger than 
expected, as well as higher stock prices, lower corporate bond rates, and a weaker 
foreign exchange value of the dollar, the st aff outlook for growth in aggregate demand 
has been marked up a bit over the near term  but is little changed farther ahead.  The 
staff has retained its assumption that the target  federal funds rate will be held constant 
at 4¾ percent during 2008 and 2009.  As investors instead anticipate some policy 
easing at this and subsequent meetings, lo nger-term Treasury yields are expected to 
firm going forward.  As usual, stock prices are assumed to rise at the 6½ percent 
annual rate required to equate the risk-adjus ted return on equities to that on Treasury 
securities.  The real foreign exchange valu e of the dollar is projected to depreciate 
about 1¼ percent per year.  Co nsistent with futures market quotes, spot oil prices are 
projected to decline gradually but from a substantially higher level than in the 
September forecast.  Against this back drop, the pace of economic expansion is 
projected to slow from 3¼ percent in the third quarter to about 1½ percent in the 
current quarter and the first quarter of 2008, as the housing correction deepens and 
the recent strength in consumer and business spending moderates.  Beyond the first 
quarter of 2008, the staff’s forecast is li ttle changed from the September Greenbook:  
Output is projected to expand somewhat  more slowly than potential over the 
remainder of 2008, and at about the same ra te as potential in 2009, when residential 
investment is anticipated to begin grow ing modestly.  The unemployment rate 
remains essentially equal to the staff’s 4¾  percent estimate of the NAIRU through the 
end of the forecast period.  Spurred by the recent surge in oil prices, total PCE 
inflation climbs to nearly 2¾ percent in the fourth quarter; it then drops to 2¼ 
percent in the first quarter of next year an d to about 1¾ percent for the rest of the 
forecast period as oil prices trend down.  Core PCE inflation rises from 1½ percent 
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)
20 of 44
over the past two quarters to 2 percent in the current quarter and subsequently 
remains just under that rate through 2009. 
Short-Run Policy Alternatives 
(18) This Bluebook presents three policy alternatives for the Committee’s 
consideration, summarized in Table 1.  Alte rnative A lowers the target federal funds 
rate 25 basis points to 4½ percent, while Al ternatives B and C leave the target rate 
unchanged at 4¾ percent.  In the rationale paragraph, all three alternatives recognize 
that economic growth was solid in the thir d quarter.  (The advance report for third-
quarter GDP growth will be published on October 31, th e second day of the FOMC 
meeting.  The staff and most private sect or forecasters expect that output grew 
significantly faster than potential last quarte r.  If third-quarter growth turns out to be 
considerably above or below expectations, “strong” or “moderate” perhaps could be 
substituted for “solid.”)  All three alternatives also acknowledge that strains in financial markets have eased somewhat on balance and suggest that the Committee 
expects some slowing of the pace of eco nomic expansion in the near term.  
Alternative A alludes to the possibility that the tightening of credit conditions since 
earlier this year could restrain economic gr owth, and Alternative B makes that point 
more directly.  Because recent inflation re adings have continued to be relatively 
benign but have not shown signs of fu rther moderation, Alternatives A and B 
maintain the language regarding inflation used in the September statement.  In 
contrast, Alternative C states that the high level of resource utilization and recent increases in energy prices may put rene wed upward pressures on both overall and 
core inflation.  While considerable uncertainty about the economic outlook remains, the three alternatives assume that the Committee is prepared to resume the practice of assessing the balance of risks to growth  and inflation.  Alternatives A and C 
characterize the downside risks to growth as roughly balancing the upside risks to

Decision 1. The Federal Open Market 
Committee decided today to lower 
its target for the federal funds rate 
50 basis points to 4-3/4 percent. The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to lower its target for 
the federal funds rate 25 basis points

2. Economic growth was moderate during the first half of the year, 
but the tightening of credit 
conditions has the potential to 
intensify the housing correction 
and to restrain economic growth 
more generally.  Today’s action is 
intended to help forestall some of 
the adverse effects on the broader 
economy that might otherwise 
arise from the disruptions in 
financial markets and to promote 
moderate growth over time. Economic growth was  solid in the 
third quarter, and strains in financial markets have eased somewhat on 
balance.  Howeve r, the pace of 
economic expansion will likely slow somewhat in the near term, partly 
reflecting the intensification of the 
housing correction.  Today’s action , 
combined with the policy action taken 
in September, should help forestall 
some of the adverse effects on the 
broader economy that might otherwise 
arise from the disruptions in financial 
markets and promote moderate 
growth over time.  Economic growth was  solid in the 
third quarter, and strains in financial markets have eased somewhat on 
balance .  The pace of economic 
expansion will likely slow somewhat in the near term, partly reflecting the 
intensification of the housing 
correction.  But, to date, other sectors 
of the economy have proven resilient 
and the global economy remains 
strong.  The Committee anticipates 
that the economic expansion will 
return to a moderate pace over time, 
but sees continuing risks to growth, notably the potential impact of the 
tightening of credit conditions  for 
some households and businesses .   Economic growth was solid in the 
third quarter despite an intensification 
of the housing correction .  Strains in 
financial markets have eased somewhat on balance, reducing the 
downside risks to growth .  Though 
incoming indicators point to some near-term slowing in the pace of 
economic expansion, the recent easing 
of monetary policy should help  
promote moderate growth over time.

Assessment 
of Risk 4. Developments in financial markets 
since the Committee’s last regular 
meeting have increased the 
uncertainty surrounding the 
economic outlook.  The 
Committee will continue to assess 
the effects of these and other 
developments on economic 
prospects and will act as needed to 
foster price stability and 
sustainable economic growth. The Committee judges that the upside 
risks to inflation roughly balance the 
downside risks to growth.   The 
Committee will continue to assess the effects of financial and other 
developments on economic prospects and will act as needed to foster price 
stability and sustainable economic 
growth.  On balance, the Committee views 
downside risks to growth as the 
greater policy concern.   The 
Committee will continue to assess the effects of financial and other 
developments on economic prospects and will act as needed to foster price

 The Committee judges that the upside 
risks to inflation roughly balance the 
downside risks to growth.   Future 
policy adjustments will depend on the outlook for both inflation and 
economic growth, as implied by 
incoming information.  
 
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)

inflation, while Alternative B identifies the downside risks to growth as the greatest 
policy concern.  As usual, the Committee could combine language from different 
alternatives. 
(19) If the Committee judges that the current stance of policy is likely to be 
consistent with sustainable growth and an acceptable trajectory for inflation over time 
but sees appreciable downside risks to growth, it may wish to choose Alternative B .  
The economy seems to have expanded at a brisk pace in the third quarter, boosted 
primarily by personal consumption and business expenditures, suggesting 
considerable underlying strength of spending  prior to the recent financial turbulence.  
In addition, strains in financial markets have eased somewhat on balance, partly 
allaying concerns about a severe credit cr unch.  The strong pe rformance of the global 
economy could also support U.S. economic growth.  And while the housing data 
received during the intermeeting period we re not encouraging, they also were not 
greatly surprising, at least from the perspe ctive of the September Greenbook forecast.  
The real federal funds rate is now equal to  its Greenbook-consistent equilibrium value 
and just a bit above the range of model-base d estimates (Chart 5), suggesting that the 
current policy stance is likely to keep outp ut in the vicinity of its potential.  In 
addition, the present target for the federal funds rate remains close to near-term policy 
prescriptions derived from optimal policy simu lations with a 2 percent inflation target 
(Chart 6) and is consistent with a number of policy rules, even assuming a 1½ percent 
inflation objective (Chart 7).  However, th e functioning of some financial markets is 
still quite far from normal, credit conditio ns have tightened considerably for some 
households and businesses since early in the year, and there is some possibility that 
recent improvements in market functioning  could be reversed.  The Committee may 
be sufficiently concerned about a possible fu rther deterioration in financial conditions 
or about potential spillovers from the housing  sector to believe that the risks to its 
growth outlook are significantly skewed to  the downside.  Moreover, it may see the 
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)
23 of 44
possibility that a weakening of the economy co uld have a negative impact on financial 
markets, leading to further tightening of credit conditions.  At the same time, the 
Committee may believe that the inflation outl ook is acceptable, although with some 
upside risks.  Inflation data have been fairly benign in recent months, suggesting that 
the underlying rate of inflation is rela tively moderate, and the Committee may be 
optimistic that recognition of its commitment to price stability will help gradually reduce inflation over time.  But the high level of resource utilization, the recent 
increases in energy and other commodity prices, and the decline in the foreign 
exchange value of the dollar may be viewed as  presenting upside risks to inflation.  
Nonetheless, the Committee may believe that the downside risks to growth are the greater policy concern.  
(20) Given that the economy likely expanded at a pace noticeably above that of 
potential in the third quarter, the draft statement for Alternative B describes recent 
growth as “solid.”  It also takes note of th e fact that strains in financial markets have 
eased somewhat on balance.  While re cognizing that the ongoing housing 
deterioration will likely weigh substantially on economic performance over the next 
few quarters, the statement points out that other sectors of the economy have proven 
resilient so far and that the global econom y remains strong.  The assessment of risk 
paragraph would note that downside risks to  growth are a greater policy concern to 
the Committee than inflation risks and then repeats the second sentence of the risk 
assessment from the September statement. (21) Market participants have priced in mo re than 25 basis points of easing at 
this meeting.  Thus, a decisi on to leave the federal funds rate unchanged is likely to 
produce a considerable backup in shorter- term interest rates.  However, with the 
statement pointing to downside risks to grow th and thus suggesting that further policy 
easing could be forthcoming, short-term ra tes are not likely to move up by the full 
amount of the policy surprise.  The anticipa tion of future policy easing will likely 
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)
24 of 44
restrain the increase in longer-term interest  rates even more.  With relative yields 
probably adjusting in favor of dollar assets, the recent tendency for the foreign 
exchange value of the dollar to depreciate could be reduced.  Equity prices would 
likely decline, given the policy surprise and the assessment that risks to growth are tilted to the downside.   (22) If the Committee has a modal outlook  similar to the Greenbook projection 
that growth will return to potential in a few quarters and sees the risks around that 
forecast as relatively balanced, it might be inclined to choose Alternative C .  Under 
this alternative, there would be no change in the target federal funds rate, and the 
statement would indicate that downside risk s to growth are balanced by upside risks 
to inflation.  Members might view the partial easing of the strains in financial markets 
since mid-summer as substantially reducing  the likelihood that instability in the 
financial system will undermine economic performance, especially since there do not 
appear to have been significant spillovers to consumer and business spending as yet.  
Indeed, the Committee may see the improved  financial market conditions and the 
outlook for growth near potential in 200 8 and 2009 as close to the situation it 
envisioned after the September policy easing.  Even if the Committee believes that 
ongoing financial strains pose downside risks to growth, it may also believe that those 
risks are partly offset by other factor s.  For example, Committee members might be 
more optimistic than the staff regarding the persistence of the recent robust growth in business fixed investment and household consumption, along the lines of the “Greater Momentum in Aggregate Demand” alternative scenario in the Greenbook.  On the inflation side, the Committee may have become more worried about the 
potential for renewed price pressures.  While inflation read ings have remained 
relatively benign, the Committe e might view the increase in energy prices over the 
past few weeks as likely to push up overal l inflation in the near term, with potential 
adverse effects on inflation expectations.  Indeed, the Committee may be concerned 
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)
25 of 44
by the increase since earlier this year of around 25 basis points in forward inflation 
compensation implied by TIPS securities.  The weakening of the dollar may also be 
seen as posing a greater inflationary threat than foreseen by the staff.  Some members 
may also be worried that current levels of resource utilization are not sustainable and 
pose an upside risk to inflation.  Others may  see particularly high costs to an increase 
in inflation from its recent readings and, partly for that reason, may have little expectation that a near-term easing of policy would be warranted.  Under these 
circumstances, the Committee might judge th at the current stance of policy is 
appropriate and believe that the downside risk s to growth are balanced by upside risks 
to inflation. (23) The proposed statement for Alternative C indicates that economic growth 
was solid in the third quarter despite the on going housing correction.  It then notes 
the easing in financial market strains and associates that development with a reduction in the downside risks to growth.  The st atement proceeds to affirm the expectation 
that the pace of economic expansion will sl ow in the near term but also that the 
substantial easing of monetary policy in September should help promote moderate 
growth over time.  The statement makes no explicit mention of potential risks 
induced by tighter credit conditions.  The wording on inflation begins by noting the 
improvement in inflation readings this yea r, as in the September FOMC statement, 
but then cites the risk that the high level of resource utilization and recent increases in 
energy prices may put renewed upward pre ssures on overall and core inflation.  The 
Committee would indicate that the downside  risks to growth are balanced by the 
upside risks to inflation and would rein troduce the indication that future policy 
adjustments will depend on the outlook for both inflation and economic growth.  Market participants would be quite surpri sed by the combination of no policy action 
at this meeting and the statement proposed  for Alternative C.  They would likely 
conclude that the Committee has no inclinat ion to lower rates in the near term.  
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)
26 of 44
Given that high odds are placed on policy easing at this and coming meetings, both 
short- and long-term interest rates would likely increase considerably following the 
announcement.  In response to the jump in interest rates, the foreign exchange value 
of the dollar might appreciate somewhat.  Although investors’ views about economic 
prospects might be buoyed to some extent by an inference that the Federal Reserve 
anticipated sustainable growth at the current  level of the federal funds rate, it seems 
more likely that market participants would mark down their expectations for economic growth.  Consequently, concerns about credit risk could increase, and 
equity prices could decline significantly. 
(24) While strains in financial markets have eased in recent weeks, functioning in 
some markets remains impaired.  Moreover, banks appear to have responded to the 
problems in funding markets, concerns ab out balance sheet capacity, and worries 
about the economic outlook by tightening terms and standards across a broad range 
of credit products.   The Committee might see these developments as reducing its modal outlook for aggregate demand relative to its expectations after its September 
action.  Alternatively, members might see th e failure of credit market conditions to 
improve more significantly and incoming ev idence of a steepening contraction in the 
housing sector as indicating that the do wnside risks to over all economic performance 
remain unacceptably large; the potential implic ations of such factors are illustrated in 
the “Greater Fallout from Financial Stress ” alternative scenario in the Greenbook.  
Either view might incline the Committee to choose Alternative A , which lowers the 
target federal funds rate 25 basis points.   The Committee might see easing policy 
another notch as an appropriate risk-man agement tactic, given the potential for 
particularly adverse outcomes, especially since a 25 basis point cut in the target federal funds rate would still be cons istent with several policy ru les (Chart 7).  Given that 
inflation data have continued to be favorable, the Committee may also believe that a policy easing would be consistent with its price stability objectives, especially if 
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)
27 of 44
members believe that, if necessary, they coul d act quickly in the future to reverse 
some or all of the easing implemented since September. 
(25) The draft statement for Alternative A, like those for Alternatives B and C, 
begins by noting the solid economic perfor mance in the third quarter and the easing 
of strains in financial markets.  As the othe r alternatives, it also recognizes that the 
pace of economic expansion will likely slow in  the near term but, by prefacing that 
consideration with the word “however,” gives it more prominence.  The statement 
then asserts that the cut in the target rate, combined with the policy easing at the 
September meeting, should help forestall some of the adverse effects on the broader economy that might otherwise arise from the disruptions in financial markets, 
replicating the words in the September stat ement.  The paragraph regarding inflation 
is unchanged from September, as in Altern ative B.  If the Committee believes that, 
after this move, the risks to growth would still be tilted somewhat to the downside 
while some upside inflation risks would re main, it could characterize the risks as 
balanced and continue by stating its intent to assess the effects of financial and other 
developments on economic prospects as in Alternative B. 
(26) Investors currently see a 25 basis point policy easing at this meeting as the 
most likely outcome.  Thus, very short-term  interest rates would likely change little in 
response to an announcement along the lines of that proposed under Alternative A.  
However, because market participants expect  more than 25 basis points of easing over 
the next few quarters, the balanced risk a ssessment, which would likely be seen as 
suggesting that further policy easing may no t be forthcoming, could prompt a modest 
increase in intermediate- and longer-term interest rates.  If participants interpreted the 
statement as suggesting reasonably good odds of sustainable growth given the easier 
stance of policy, the equity market might rally modestly and the foreign exchange 
value of the dollar could firm a bit.

Money and Debt Forecasts 
(27) Under the Greenbook projection, M2 is forecast to grow at about a 5½ 
percent rate on average in the current quart er and the first quarter of 2008—about 1 
percentage point higher than in the previo us forecast, which assumed a more gradual 
policy easing than the Committee implemente d at the September meeting.  After the 
first quarter of next year, M2 growth is proj ected to slow to just under a 4½ percent 
pace for the remainder of the projection period, about in line with the rate forecast in 
the September Bluebook. (28) After having expanded at an annual rate of 7½ percent in the first half of 
the year, domestic nonfinancial debt is expected to increase at about a 6½ percent pace in the second half of 2007 and a 4¾  percent rate in 2008 and 2009.  The 
deceleration in total nonfinancial sector  debt reflects a projected slowdown in 
borrowing across all major sectors except the federal government.  With house prices 
expected to decline, home sales seen as falling further before posting a modest 
recovery in 2009, and tighter standards and terms on mortgage loans projected to 
persist for at least some borrowers, the staff expects household debt growth to slow to 4¾ percent at an annual rate in the second half of this year and to 3½ percent in 
2008 and 2009, which would be the slowest annu al rate of growth in real terms since 
1991.  Nonfinancial business debt, which expa nded robustly in the third quarter, is 
projected to decelerate somewhat over the forecast period, as the demand for funds 
to finance LBOs and share repurchases abates.

Appendix A: Measures of the  Equilibrium Real Rate 
 
The equilibrium real rate is the real  federal funds rate that, if maintained, would be projected to return 
output to its potential level over time.   The short-run equilibrium rate is  defined as the rate that would 
close the output gap in twelve qua rters given the corresponding model’s projection of the economy.   
The medium-run concept is the value of  the real federal funds rate proj ected to keep ou tput at potential 
in seven years, under the assumption that monetary policy acts to bring actua l and potential output into 
line in the short run and then keeps them equal thereafter.  The TIPS-based factor model measure 
provides an estimate of market expectations for the real federal funds rate seven years ahead.  
 
The actual real federal funds rate is  constructed as the difference betw een the nominal rate and realized 
inflation, where the nominal rate is measured as the quarterly average of the observed federal funds rate, 
and realized inflation is given by the log difference between the co re PCE price index and its lagged 
value four quarters earlier.  For th e current quarter, the nominal rate is specified as the target federal 
funds rate on the Bluebook publication date.  For the current quarter and th e previous quarter, the 
inflation rate is computed using the sta ff’s estimate of the core PCE price index. 
 Confidence intervals reflect uncertainties about model specification, coefficients, and the level of 
potential output.  The final column of the table in dicates the values published in the previous Bluebook. 
  
Measure Description 
Single-equation 
Model  The measure of the equilibrium real rate in the single-equation model is based on an 
estimated aggregate-demand relationship between  the current value of the output gap and 
its lagged values as well as the lagged va lues of the real federal funds rate. 
Small Structural 
Model  The small-scale model of the economy consists of equations for five variables: the output 
gap, the equity premium, the federal budget surp lus, the trend growth rate of output, and 
the real bond yield. 
Large Model 
(FRB/US) Estimates of the equilibrium real rate using FRB/US—the staff’s large-scale econometric 
model of the U.S. economy—depend on a very broad array of economic factors, some of 
which take the form of projected valu es of the model’s exogenous variables. 
Greenbook-
consistent  The FRB/US model is used in conjunction with an extended version of the Greenbook 
forecast to derive a Greenbook-consistent measure .  FRB/US is first add-factored so that 
its simulation matches the extended Greenbook forecast, and then a second simulation is 
run off this baseline to determine the value of the real federal funds rate that closes the 
output gap. 
TIPS-based 
Factor Model Yields on TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) reflect investors’ expectations of 
the future path of real interest rates, but also include term and liquidity premiums.  The 
TIPS-based measure of the equilibrium real ra te is constructed using the seven-year-ahead 
instantaneous real forward rate derived fro m TIPS yields as of the Bluebook publication 
date.  This forward rate is adjusted to remove estimates of the term and liquidity 
premiums based on a three-factor arbitrage -free term-structure model applied to TIPS 
yields, nominal yields, and inflation.  Because TIPS indexation is based on the total CPI, this measure is also adjusted for the me dium-term difference—projected at 40 basis 
points—between total CPI inflation and core PCE inflation.

Appendix B: Analysis of Policy Paths and Confidence Intervals 
 
Rule Specifications :  For the following rules, it denotes the federal funds rate for quarter t , while  
the explanatory variables include the staff’s projec tion of trailing four-quart er core PCE inflation ( πt), 
inflation two and three quarters ahead ( πt+2|t and π t+3|t), the output gap in the current period and one 
quarter ahead (*
ttyy−  and *
1| 1|tt ttyy++− ), and the three-quarter-ahead forecast of annual average GDP 
growth relative to potential (44*
3| 3| tt ttyy++Δ− Δ ), and *π denotes an assumed value of policymakers’ 
long-run inflation objective.  The outcome-based a nd forecast-based rules were estimated using real-
time data over the sample 1988:1-2006:4; each specifi cation was chosen using the Bayesian information 
criterion. Each rule incorporates a 75 basis point shift in the interc ept, specified as a sequence of  
25 basis point increments during the first three quarters of 1998.  The first two simple rules were 
proposed by Taylor (1993, 1999), while  the third is a vari ant of the Taylor ( 1999) rule—introduced  
in the August Bluebook—with  a higher value of r*.  The prescriptions of the first-difference rule do  
not depend on assumptions regarding r* or the level of the output  gap; see Orphanides (2003). 
 
Outcome-based rule it =  1.20i t-1–0.39i t-2+0.19[1.17  + 1.73 πt  + 3.66(*

ttyy− )  
First-difference rule it = i t-1 + 0.5(πt+3|t –*π) + 0.5(44*
3| 3| tt ttyy+ + Δ− Δ ) 
 
FRB/US Model Simulations :  Prescriptions from the two empiri cal rules are computed using dynamic 
simulations of the FRB/US model, implemented as though the rule were followed starting at this FOMC 
meeting.  The dotted line labeled “Previous Bluebook” is  based on the current specification of the policy 
rule, applied to the previous Gr eenbook projection.  Confidence intervals are based on stochastic 
simulations of the FRB/US model with shocks drawn from the estimated residuals over 1986-2005.  
Information from Financial Markets :  The expected funds rate path is based on forward rate 
agreements, and the confidence intervals for this path are constructed using prices of interest rate caps. 
Near-Term Prescriptions of Simple Policy Rules :  These prescriptions are calculated using Greenbook 
projections for inflation and the output gap. Because the first-difference rule involves the lagged funds 
rate, the value labeled “Previous Bluebook” for the curr ent quarter is computed using the actual value  
of the lagged funds rate, and the one -quarter-ahead prescriptions are ba sed on this rule’s prescription for 
the current quarter.

Inflation Indicator Based on M2
Note: P* is defined to equal M2 times V* divided by potential GDP. V*, or long-run velocity, is estimated
using average velocity over the 1959:Q1-to-1989:Q4 period and then, after a break, over the interval from
1993:Q1 to the present. For the forecast period, P* is based on the staff M2 forecast and P is simulated using a
short-run dynamic model relating P to P*. Blue areas indicate periods in which P* is notably less than P.
Gray areas denote the projection period.1965 1968
