CLASS I FOMC  – RESTRICTED CONTROLLED (FR) JANUARY 24, 2008 
MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES   
Recent Developments 
Summary 
(1) Heightened concerns about credit lo sses and the global economic outlook 
together with the anticipation and subseque nt realization of substantial near-term 
policy easing have dominated financial market developments since the December 
FOMC meeting.  Although pressures in  short-term funding markets abated 
significantly after year-end, broader financ ial market conditions deteriorated sharply 
amid increased concerns about the economic outlook and additional write-downs of 
mortgage-related assets by large financial fi rms.  Even after the 75 basis point rate cut 
on January 22, market participants see substant ial odds of at least 50 basis points of 
additional easing on January 30.  Moreover , the expected path of policy now bottoms 
out at around 2¼ percent in early 2009, ab out 90 basis points lowe r than at the time 
of the December meeting.  Shorter-term nom inal Treasury yields fell in line with 
policy expectations; longer-dated Treasury yields also fell steeply.  Corporate bond 
spreads rose to their highest levels in about five years, with speculative-grade spreads 
jumping almost 130 basis points over the pe riod since the December FOMC meeting.  
Broad equity price indexes dropped about 11 percent, on net, with financial stocks 
especially hard hit.  Respondents to the January Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey reported tightening standards and terms over the past three months for a wide range of business and household loan categories; they also noted a broad softening of loan demand.  
   
Monetary Policy Expectations and Treasury Yields 
(2) The FOMC’s decision at its December meeting to lower the target federal 
funds rate by 25 basis points to 4¼ pe rcent was largely an ticipated by market 
participants.1  However, investors were surprised that policymakers did not 
simultaneously announce other measures to address strains in term funding markets.  
Near-term Eurodollar futures rates rose ab out 20 basis points, but Treasury coupon 
yields fell 10 to 20 basis points as in vestors’ concerns about the macroeconomic 
effects of funding market strains intensifie d.  These moves were largely reversed the 
next day, following the announcement of the establishment of the Term Auction 
Facility and reciprocal currency arrangements with two foreign central banks.  
Economic data—particularly the ISM and employment reports for December—came 
in softer than expected and prompted sharp reductions in money market futures rates.  Although the release of the minutes of the December meeting elicited only a limited response in financial markets, interest rate s moved down further in response to the 
Chairman’s January 10 speech and to speeches by other Federal Reserve officials that 
were read as suggesting that signs of  broader economic weakness and additional 
financial strains would likely require an easi er stance of policy.  Although investors 
had speculated about the possibility of an  intermeeting move, the 75 basis point 
reduction in the target on January 22 came  as a considerable surprise, and rates on 
money market futures contracts declined not ably on the announcement.   On net, 
market participants now expect the funds rate  to fall to around 2¼ percent by early 
2009 (Chart 1).  Judging from quotes on federal funds target binary options, investors place 34 percent odds on a quarter-point cu t in the target at the upcoming FOMC 
meeting and 65 percent probability on a policy easing of 50 basis points or
 more.  As 
                                           
1 The effective federal funds rate averaged 4. 12 percent over the intermeeting period.  The 
rate was again more volatile than usual.  Th e intraday standard deviation over the period 
averaged 27 basis points, significantly higher  than was typical before August, and the 
interday standard deviati on was likewise elevated.

of earlier this week, respondents to th e Desk’s recent survey of primary dealers 
assigned around 60 percent probability to a 50 basis point rate cut, and most 
respondents anticipated no substantial chan ges from the January 22 statement.  On 
balance, market uncertainty about the course of monetary policy over the next year rose somewhat, and the negative skewness in option-implied distributions of the 
federal funds rate six months ahead seemed to have disappeared. (3) Consistent with the reduction in the federal funds rate target and 
expectations of additional substantial policy easing, yields on two-year nominal 
Treasury securities fell about 94 basis poi nts, on net, and ten-year nominal Treasury 
yields declined about 46 basis points.  Yields on ten-year TIPS fell nearly as much as their nominal counterparts.  According to the staff’s term structure models, the 
substantial decline in TIPS yields sinc e the December FOMC meeting owed roughly 
equally to lower expected real short rates, consistent with the downward revision to 
the outlook for the economy, and to a reduct ion in real term premiums.  TIPS-based 
inflation compensation at a five-year horiz on moved roughly in line with oil prices 
and is now 12 basis points lower, on net, th an at the time of the December meeting.  
Amid volatile trading conditions, five-yea r-forward inflation compensation five years 
ahead rose 23 basis points over the period since the December FOMC meeting, on 
balance, including a 10 basis point increase on the day of the rate cut on January 22.  
However, according to the desk’s survey of primary dealers, expected CPI inflation 
between five and ten years ahead increase d only slightly from the December survey 
results, and the Michigan survey of households indicates that expected inflation over the next five to ten years edged down 10 basis points to 3 percent in January.  Term 
structure models as well as back-of-the-enve lope calculations sugge st the rise in TIPS-
based inflation compensation owes to modestly  higher inflation risk premiums rather 
than higher inflation expectations.

Money Markets 
(4) Conditions in short-term funding marke ts have improved notably since the 
December FOMC meeting.  Sp reads of term federal fund rates and libor over 
comparable-maturity OIS rates narrowed so mewhat following the announcement and 
subsequent implementation of the Term Auction Facility (See box “The Term 
Auction Facility and the Federal Funds Market”), and they fell considerably further after year-end.  Financial institutions’ evident ability to raise capital may also have had 
beneficial effects on bank funding markets.  Conditions in European interbank money 
markets also improved noticeably over th e intermeeting period, as spreads on both 
overnight and term euro and sterling bo rrowing narrowed substantially.  In mid-
December, the European Central Bank, Swiss National Bank, Bank of England, and Bank of Canada all announced special operations aimed at calming term money 
markets as part of a concerted effort with the Federal Reserve.  The European Central Bank and the Swiss National Bank auctioned $20 billion and $4 billion, respectively, of term funds they obtained in currency swaps with the Federal Reserve.  The 
European Central Bank also auctioned an unusually large amount of term funds in 
euros, while the Bank of England and Bank of Canada auctioned smaller amounts of 
funds in sterling and Canadian dollars, respectively.  Market participants reported that 
the coordinated central bank measures c ontributed to the improvement in money 
market conditions.  In the United States, spreads on asset-backed commercial paper 
over AA financial paper have dropped considerably from their very high levels in mid- to late December.  Spreads on lower-ra ted nonfinancial unsecured paper over AA 
nonfinancial paper have also fallen from their year-end highs but remain above the 
levels in late October when year-end pressures became apparent.  Asset-backed commercial paper outstanding increased during the first half of January, the first rise since last summer (Chart 2); the volume of unsecured paper was little changed over

Memo: One-month libor on

In response
 to strains in term funding markets, the Federal Reserve established in December a 
Term Auction Facility (TAF)—a temporary prog ram in which the Federal Reserve auctions 
funds for fixed terms of approximately one month to  depository institutions that are judged to 
be in generally sound financial condition.  The TAF was established in coordination with the arrangement of swap lines to fu nd similar dollar liquidity facilities at other central banks.  
Judging from the first three auctions held in December an
 d January, the TAF appears to have 
largely overcome the main drawback of the pr imary credit program: the perceived stigma 
associated with borrowing from the discou nt window.  All of the auctions were 
oversubscribed, with a substantial number of bidders, ample bid-to-cover ratios, and stop-out rates that were below prevailing term market rates.  Funds were awarded to a sizable and 
diverse group of depository institutions.  To maintain the overnight federal funds rate close to 
the target, the Desk offset the extra provision  of reserve balances through the TAF and the 
swap lines with other central banks by redeeming $56 billion in Treasury bills and by reducing 
the level of long-term repurchase agr eements outstanding by $9 billion. 
While it is not possible to isolate the impact of  the TAF on financial markets from the effects 
of other recent market developments and the unev entful turn of the year, market 
 participants 
attributed some of the narrowing in the spread  between libor rates and overnight index swap 
rates of comparable maturities since mid-December to the TAF auctions and the 
accompanying auctions of term dollar fundin g from the European Central Bank and the Swiss 
National Ba
nk.  The TAF may also have contribute d to a reduction in volatility in the federal 
funds market, but, according to market commentary, the passing of the year end without 
serious disruption was likely at least as important to the stabilization in that market.  From the 
December FOMC meeting through the end of 2007,  the intraday standard deviation of the 
funds rate was 40 basis points, on average; it has fallen to 13 basis points so far this year.  An important cause of the volatility in the funds rate  late last year—a significant spread between 
rates paid by foreign banks over those paid by  domestic banks and the associated tendency for 
the funds rate to be firm to the target in the morning and then soft en after the close of 
business in Europe—has moderated significantly,  perhaps in part because the TAF and other 
central bank auctions reduced foreign banks’ concern about their access to liquidity.

the entire period since the December FOMC  meeting.  The outstanding amount of 
European asset-backed commercial paper continued to decline.  
Capital Markets 
(5) Broad-based U.S. equity price indexes were highly volatile and fell 11 
percent over the period since the Decembe r FOMC meeting in response to concerns 
about global economic outlook and substant ial additional write-downs at large 
financial institutions.  Financial stocks notably underperformed the broad indexes, 
although declines were widespread across sectors.  The spread between the twelve-
month forward trend earnings-price ratio for S&P 500 firms and a real long-run 
Treasury yield—a rough gauge of the equity risk premium—widened further.  Option-implied volatility on the S&P 500 index has moved higher on net since the December FOMC meeting, at times rising  back to near its August pe aks.  Yields on investment-
grade corporate bonds fell less than those on comparable-maturity Treasury securities 
over the period since the last FOMC meeting, while yields on speculative-grade bonds rose markedly.  As a result, spreads of both investment- and speculative-grade bond 
yields over comparable-maturity Treasury yi elds increased to their highest levels in 
about five years.  The sharp rise in speculat ive-grade spreads primarily reflects higher 
spreads in near-term forward rates, suggest ing increased concerns on the part of 
investors about corporate credit quality over  the next few years.  Gross bond issuance 
by nonfinancial firms was robust in Dece mber but has slowed this month.  The 
pipeline of leveraged loans awaiting synd ication remains substantial, and secondary 
market bid prices for liquid leveraged loans d eclined further from levels already below 
those observed in early August.  An inde x of credit default swaps on leveraged 
syndicated loans (the LCDX) has risen ab out 90 basis points, on net, since the 
December FOMC meeting.  The ratio of municipal bond yields to those on Treasuries 
remains elevated, reflecting concerns about the strength of financial guarantors.  CDS

spreads on major financial guarantors ha ve widened sharply since the December 
FOMC meeting, spurred by mounting worries about their exposure to subprime 
mortgage securities and fears about the possible effects of actual and potential 
downgrades by major rating agencies.  Th ese spreads narrowed a good bit on January 
23 in response to a news article suggesting that New York insurance regulators are working on a plan to support financia l guarantors, but remained very high.  
(6) Over the period since the December meeting, interest rates on thirty-year 
fixed-rate conforming mortgages and one-yea r adjustable-rate conforming loans fell 
63 and 51 basis points, to 5.48 and 4.99 percent, respectively.  Posted offer rates on thirty-year jumbo mortgages have also decreased since the December FOMC meeting, but the availability of such credit continue d to be tight.  Issuance of residential 
mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) backed by nonconforming loans was extremely weak in the fourth quarter.  ABX spreads for all tranches continued to widen.  In 
contrast, issuance of agency MBS backed by  conforming mortgages remained robust 
and spreads on such securities retreated fu rther from their recent highs as year-end 
pressures eased.   
Market Functioning Outside of Money Markets 
(7) Trading conditions in a number of fina ncial markets were strained at times.  
Liquidity in the market for Treasury coupon securities was somewhat impaired in 
December, amid concerns about year-end, and ag ain in late January, reflecting flight-
to-quality flows.  Spreads between on- an d off-the-run ten-year Treasury notes 
remained at multi-year highs throughout the period.  Bid-asked spreads on both on-
the-run and off-the-run Treasury notes had retreated to near-normal levels after year-end, but they rose again on January 22 and remain elevated, on net.  Treasury bill 
yields initially rose after the turn of the year, as market participants reported significantly improved trading condition s; however, more recently, renewed safe-

haven flows pushed three-month Treasury bill  yields 68 basis points lower, on net.  
Similarly, overnight general collateral re po rate continued to trade well below the 
overnight federal funds rate for most of the period since the December FOMC 
meeting.  Lending from the SOMA securiti es portfolio reached record levels in 
December, led by strong demand for Treasury collateral ahead of year-end, and were 
again elevated in late January.  Several measures of liquidity in corporate markets 
showed signs of deterioration before the tu rn of the year—tradi ng volumes declined 
significantly, a proxy for bid-asked spreads on corporate bonds widened, and trades appeared to have a larger-than-normal im pact on prices—but these trends largely 
reversed in January.  Bid-asked spreads for leveraged syndicated loans have widened a good bit since December and are now a few basis points above the peaks reached in 
August.  Judging from the abnormally wide  range of quotes submitted by various 
dealers for the same reference entities, li quidity and price discovery remain impaired 
in CDS markets.  The FX swap market also  shows signs of improvement, although 
trading conditions remained somewhat strained. 
Foreign Developments 
(8) Foreign financial markets were unse ttled over the period since the 
December FOMC meeting, reflecting grow ing concerns about further financial 
distress and global spillovers from slower U.S. growth.  Late in the period, broad 
equity price indexes in major  foreign equity markets droppe d sharply.  Stock prices 
rebounded somewhat following the FOMC ’s announcement on January 22 of the 75 
basis point cut in its federal funds target, but equity markets have remained jittery.  
Stock prices in many emerging market economies in Asia, Latin America, and Eastern Europe—which previously had not been mu ch affected by the turmoil in other 
markets—experienced severe declines over  this period.  Since the December FOMC 
meeting, foreign stock prices have fallen  on net by amounts that range from 10 to 
Class I FOMC - Restricted-Controlled (FR)
10 of 38
   
nearly 20 percent, with financial stocks leading the way down (Chart 3).  Yields on 
long-term government securities in major fo reign industrial countr
ies declined 15 to 
25 basis points, reflecting lower policy ex pectations, and CDS and EMBI+ spreads on 
emerging market sovereign debt widened noti ceably, as investors attempted to reduce 
risk.  The trade-weighted foreign exchange value of the dollar against major currencies 
has moved down ¾ percent on balance since the December FOMC meeting.2  The 
dollar depreciated more than 4½ percent ag ainst the yen and nearly as much against 
the Swiss franc, driven in part by th e unwinding of carry-trade positions by 
increasingly risk-shy investors.  The dollar  declined slightly on balance against an 
index of currencies of our other important tr ading partners.  On January 22, the Bank 
of Canada cut its policy rate 25 basis poi nts, citing lower Cana dian inflation and a 
weaker outlook for the U.S. economy.   
Debt and Money 
(9) The debt of domestic nonfinancial sector s is estimated to have expanded at 
an annual rate of 7¼ percent in the fourth quarter of last year, almost 2 percentage 
points less than in the previous quarter (Cha rt 4).  Growth of nonfinancial business 
debt decelerated in the fourth quarter from its rapid third-quarter pace, as growth in 
C&I loans slowed and
 despite robust bond issuance.  The limited data on financing 
activity since year-end suggest that business borrowing has slowed further this month.  
In the household sector, home mortgage debt is projected to have decelerated further 
in the fourth quarter, reflecting the weakness in home prices, declining home sales, and tighter credit conditions for some borrowers.  Consumer credit continued to expand at a moderate pace last quarter.  Banks indicated on the most recent Senior 
Loan Officer Opinion Survey that they had tightened standards and terms on many 
                                           
2   There were no foreign official purchases or sales of dollars by reporting central banks in 
industrial countries during the intermeeting period.

in loan quality in 2008.  
(10) M2 grew 6 percent at an annual rate  in December, boosted primarily by 
flows to the relative safety an d liquidity of retail money funds.3  Growth in small time 
deposits edged down but remained elevated, as several thrift institutions offered 
attractive deposit rates to secure fundin g.  A deceleration in liquid deposits amid

Economic Outlook  
(11) The staff has marked down substantially its projection for aggregate 
demand relative to aggregate supply sin ce the December Greenbook, in response to  
a sharp drop in equity prices, tighter conditions in some credit markets, and 
surprisingly weak indicators of real activity .  As a consequence, the staff forecast takes 
on board the 75 basis point reduction on January 22 and assumes another 50 basis point cut at this meeting; from that point on, the funds rate is assumed to remain steady at 3 percent through the end of 2009.  Longer-term Treasury yields are projected to edge up as investors’ expect ations about the path of monetary policy—
which currently embed further easing in co ming months—gradually converge to the 
staff’s assumption.  Stock prices are assumed to climb at an annual rate of 13 percent 
over the next two years, as the equity prem ium declines toward more normal levels  
in response to the gradual waning of macro economic risks.  The real foreign exchange 
value of the dollar is assumed to depreciat e about 2½ percent annually in 2008 and 
2009.  The price of crude oi l is little revised from the December Greenbook, and still 
is expected to decline grad ually.  The staff forecast assumes that the adoption of  
a fiscal stimulus package—comprising in dividual income tax rebates and a bonus 
depreciation allowance for investment in 2008—will boost growth this year but subtract from it next year, leaving the level of GDP at the end of 2009 only a bit 
higher than in the absence of the assumed fi scal package.  Nonetheless, with a leveling 
off of residential investment and a gradual ea sing of credit conditions, the pace of real 
GDP growth is projected to pick up from about 1½ percent this year to around  
2¼ percent in 2009.  The unemployment rate  is projected to rise gradually, reaching 
5¼ percent in 2009, about ½ percentage point above the staff’s estimate of the 
NAIRU.  Both the level and the growth rate  of potential output, in history and going 
forward, have been revised upward since December, causing the output gap to show 
more slack than in December.  While recent  monthly readings on inflation have been 
Class I FOMC - Restricted-Controlled (FR)
15 of 38
   
elevated, the public’s expectations of fu ture inflation appear to have remained 
reasonably well contained.  With oil prices  assumed to edge down and slack in labor 
and product markets rising, total PCE inflation is projected to decline from  
2¼ percent in 2008 to about 1¾ percent in  2009, and core PCE inflation edges down 
from just above 2 percent this year to just below 2 percent next year. 
(12) The staff’s forecast has been exte nded beyond 2009 using the FRB/US 
model with adjustments to ensure consis tency with the staff’s assessment of  
longer-run trends.  The extended forecast embeds several key assumptions:  Monetary 
policy aims to stabilize core PCE inflation, in the long run, at a level of 1¾ percent 
(the midpoint of the range of FOMC participants’ October projections for the rate of inflation in 2010); trend multifactor produc tivity growth slows gradually towards  
an annual rate of 1 percent; the real pr ice of energy remains approximately flat;  
the real value of the dollar depreciates stead ily at about 1¼ percent per year; and fiscal 
policy is essentially neutral.  The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, with the federal funds rate staying at 3 percent through 2010, before moving back up 
into the neighborhood of 4 percent.  As a result, the unemployment rate gradually 
declines to 4¾ percent—the staff’s asse ssment of the NAIRU—by 2012, while PCE 
inflation converges to 1¾ percent.  The real  federal funds rate increases from about  
1 percent in 2008 to about 2¼ percent by the end of 2012.  
Monetary Policy Strategies 
(13) As indicated in Chart 5, the Greenbook-consistent measure of short-run 
r*—the value that would close the output gap over the next twelve quarters—now 
stands at 0.8 percent, 1½ percentage poi nts lower than in the December Bluebook 
and about 60 basis points below the current value of the real federal funds rate.   
The downward revision reflects the drop in equity prices, the tightening of credit 
markets, and the receipt of weaker-tha n-expected economic data since early

December, as well as the staff’s reassessm ent of the supply-side dimensions of  
the forecast.  Such factors, most important ly the decline in equity prices since  
the December Greenbook, also induced sharp declines in the estimates of short-run 
r* obtained from the small structural model and the FRB/US model.  These two 
estimates are now virtually identical to  the Greenbook-consistent measure.  In 
contrast, the estimate obtained from the single equation model has been marked 
down much less—from 2½ percent to about 2¼ percent—because this measure depends on current and lagged values of  the output gap but not on financial 
conditions or other leading in dicators of aggregate demand. 
(14) Chart 6 depicts FRB/US optimal contro l simulations in which policymakers 
place equal weights on keeping core PCE inflation close to a specified goal, on 
keeping unemployment close to the long-r un NAIRU, and on avoiding changes in  
the nominal federal funds rate.
4  For an inflation goal of 1½ percent (the left-hand set 
of charts), the optimal control simulation pr escribes a nominal federal funds rate that 
declines slowly to near 3 percent over the next three years or so and then rises 
modestly to about 3½ percent by 2012.  With  an inflation goal of  2 percent (the right-
hand set of charts), the optimal funds rate falls more sharply to below 2½ percent by 
the end of next year before rising to about 4 percent by 2012.  Under either inflation goal, these prescriptions are substantially  lower than those shown in the December 
Bluebook, largely reflecting the weaker ou tlook for aggregate demand relative to 
aggregate supply in the current forecast.  The unemployment rates over the next 
several years are noticeably higher than in th e previous Bluebook.  The trajectories for 
core inflation for this year are abov e those shown in December but roughly 
unchanged thereafter.  
                                           
4 In these simulations, policymakers are assumed to have a distaste for changing the current-
quarter federal funds rate from its previous-quarter level; this inertia is the primary reason 
why the optimal policy path under either inflation goal prescribes a rate that remains above  
4 percent in the current quarter—close to it s 2007Q4 average of 4.5 percent—and declines 
only gradually over subsequent quarters.

(15) As shown in Chart 7, the outcome-based monetary policy rule (the left 
panel) prescribes a funds rate path that d eclines to 3¼ percent in
 2010; on average,  
this trajectory is more than a percentage point lower than in the December Bluebook. 
Financial market participants anticipate an even steeper downward slope to the path 
of policy in coming quarters, with the funds rate declinin g to 2 percent by the end  
of this year; indeed, forward contracts indica te that the funds rate is now expected  
to remain below 4 percent through the end of  2012 (the right pane l).  The confidence 
intervals obtained from stochastic simu lations of the FRB/US model and from 
options on interest rate caps each indicate  a significant probability that the funds rate 
falls below 2 percent within the next few quarters and is below 2 percent through  the end of 2012.  The near-term prescription s from the Taylor (1993) rule are higher 
than in December because of recent elevated readings on co re inflation, while those 
from the Taylor (1999) rule are more sensitive to aggregate demand and hence 
somewhat lower than in th e previous Bluebook.

Short-Run Policy Alternatives 
(16) This Bluebook presents four poli cy alternatives for the Committee’s 
consideration, summarized in Table 1.  The text shown in  red indicates the changes 
from the January 22 statement, which appears along with the December 11  
statement on the page following the table.  Alternative A cuts the federal funds  
rate target by 75 basis points to 2¾ percen
t, Alternative B cuts the target 50 basis 
points to 3 percent, Alternative C cuts the target 25 basis points to 3¼ percent,  
and Alternative D leaves the target unchange d at 3½ percent.  For each of the four 
alternatives, the rationale paragraph refers to considerable stress in financial markets, 
tightening of credit conditions, and the deepening of the housing contraction;  
the three easing alternatives also menti on the recent softening in labor markets.   
Each alternative states that policymakers ex pect inflation to moderate this year  
while emphasizing the need for careful mo nitoring of inflation developments.   
All four alternatives note that the current stance of policy should help promote 
moderate growth over time; Alternatives A and B also indicate that these policy actions should help mitigate the risks to economic activity.  Alternative A states  
that downside risks “may well remain” and that incoming information will determine 
“whether further action is needed to addr ess those risks.”  Alternative B states  
that “downside risks to growth remain” wh ereas Alternatives C and D reiterate the  
January 22 assessment that “appreciable” downside risks remain; all three of these alternatives indicate—as in the January 22  statement—that policymakers “will act  
in a timely manner as needed to address t hose risks.”  As usual, the Committee could 
formulate its statement using language  from more than one alternative. 
(17) If incoming information in recen
t weeks has led policymakers to mark 
down their assessment of the modal outl ook for aggregate demand relative to 
aggregate supply by an amount similar to th at of the staff, then the Committee may 
prefer to reduce the target funds rate by 50 basis points at th is meeting, as in

Rationale 3.  The Committee expects inflation to moderate in coming quarters , 
reflecting well-anchored inflation expectations, a projected leveling out 
of energy prices, and easing pressures 
on resource utilization.  However,

commodity prices, as well as  other 
factors, could put upward pressure on inflation.  Therefore, it will be 
necessary to continue to monitor inflation developments carefully. The Committee expects inflation to moderate in coming quarters, but it

Assessment 
of Risk 4.  Today’s policy action, combined 
with those taken earlier, should help to promote moderate growth over time 
and to mitigate the risks to economic 
activity.  However, downside risks to

effects of financial and other 
developments on economic prospects 
to determine whether further action is 
needed to address those risks. Today’s policy action, combined with

 January 22, 2008 Statement 
1.  The Federal Open Market Committee has decided to lower its target for the federal 
funds rate 75 basis points to 3-1/2 percent.  
2.  The Committee took this action in view of a weakening of the economic outlook and 
increasing downside risks to growth.  Wh ile strains in short-term funding markets 
have eased somewhat, broader financial market conditions have continued to 
deteriorate and credit has tightened further for some businesses and households.  
Moreover, incoming information indicates a deepening of the housing contraction as 
well as some softening in labor markets. 
3.  The Committee expects inflation to mode rate in coming quarters, but it will be 
necessary to continue to monitor inflation developments carefully. 
4.  Appreciable downside risks to growth re main.  The Committee will continue to assess 
the effects of financial and other developments on economic prospects and will act in a timely manner as needed to address those risks.  
December 11, 2007 Statement 
1.  The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to lower its target for the federal 
funds rate 25 basis points to 4-1/4 percent. 
2.  Incoming information suggests that ec onomic growth is slowing, reflecting the 
intensification of the housing correction and some softening in business and consumer 
spending. Moreover, strains in financial ma rkets have increased in recent weeks.  
Today’s action, combined with the policy actions taken earlier, should help promote moderate growth over time.  
3.  Readings on core inflation have improved modestly this year, but  elevated energy and 
commodity prices, among other factors, may put upward pressure on inflation.  In this 
context, the Committee judges that  some inflation risks remain, and it will continue to 
monitor inflation developments carefully. 
4.  Recent developments, including the deterior ation in financial market conditions, have 
increased the uncertainty surrounding the outlo ok for economic growth and inflation.  
The Committee will continue to assess the effects of financial and other developments 
on economic prospects and will act as needed to foster price stability and sustainable 
economic growth.

Alternative B .  The staff forecast’s assumes that the funds rate is cut to 3 percent  
at this meeting and then maintained at that  rate through 2009; with that stance of 
policy, the unemployment rate remains ab out ½ percentage point above the staff’s 
estimate of the NAIRU while core inflation edges just below 2 percent at the end of 
next year.  Members might consider this combination of outcomes to be about the 
best feasible under current circumstances, re flecting the extent to which recent data 
have pointed towards a noticeable worsening of the short-run tradeoff between 
economic activity and inflat ion.  Even if Committee me mbers are somewhat more 
optimistic than the staff regarding the modal outlook for economic activity, they may 
view this policy action as appropriate for mitigating the downside risks to growth  
that were emphasized in the January 22 FO MC statement.  Indeed, since investors’ 
uncertainty about the economic outlook is appa rently contributing to elevated credit 
spreads and dampened consumer and business spending, a substantial easing move  at this meeting could bolster confidence that policymakers will act as needed to foster 
sustained growth and reduce the likelihood  of adverse macroeconomic developments 
such as the Greenbook’s “Recession” scenar io.  However, policymakers may prefer  
at this stage not to take out further insu rance by easing more than 50 basis points, 
given the possibility that such a move could induce an upward shift in the distribution 
of inflation outcomes over coming quarters, as illustrated by the “Gradual Reversal” 
scenario in the box on “Risk Management Strategies.”  Nonetheless, by explicitly 
noting that downside risks remain, the Committee would suggest the possibility that 
substantial further easing could be needed in response to incoming information. (18) The statement under Alternative B larg ely reiterates the rationale portion  
of the January 22 statement, including refere nces to “considerable stress” in financial 
markets, tightening of credit conditions, deepening of the housing contraction, and 
some softening of labor markets, as well as  restating the Committee’s assessment of 
the prospects for inflation.  The final paragraph of the statement indicates that

Simple policy rules can serve as useful benchmarks  
 for monetary policy.  However, such rules are generally  
 specified in terms of the modal forecast and hence  
 abstract from risk management considerations.  In this  
 box, we gauge the benefits and costs of alternative  
 policy strategies using the ve rsion of the FRB/US model
 in which expectations of the private sector are formed  
 based on past economic data.  As a point of reference, 
suppose that the Greenbook outlook is the best feasible  under current circumstances, at least in the absence of  uncertainty. 
Now consider the “Recession” scenario presented in   the Greenbook alternative simulations.  When monetary 
 policy is determined by the Bluebook’s Outcome-Based  
 Rule (dotted lines), the federal funds rate declines  
 gradually in response to incoming data, reaching a trough 
 of about ¾ percent in late 2009 before returning to the 
 Greenbook baseline a few years later.  With this policy, 
 the unemployment rate rises a bit above 6 percent next 
 year and takes about five years to return to the NAIRU, 
 while core PCE inflation falls well below the assumed  
long-run inflation goal of 1¾ percent.   
If policymakers could instantly be sure that such a   recession was already in train,  they might well cut the   funds rate target immediately to a rate below 1 percent 
in order to reduce the severity of the downturn.  In reality, 
 of course, economic turning points are notoriously difficult 
 to predict or even to identi fy contemporaneously.  Thus, 
 policymakers might prefer to take out some insurance by 
 easing the stance of policy even before the onset of 
 recession was fully evident.   
 Such an approach is illustrated by the Risk Management  path (solid lines), in which the funds rate target is  
 reduced to 1½ percent for two quarters and thereafter  follows the prescriptions of the outcome-based rule.    This policy has visible effects in stabilizing economic   activity and inflation:  The un employment rate at the peak  of the recession is about ¼ percentage point lower than  in the absence of insurance, and the inflation rate stays 
 noticeably closer to the assumed long-run inflation goal  
 of 1¾ percent.

Four-quarter moving averageIt is also important to gauge the costs that would be  
incurred in following such a risk management strategy  
if in fact no recession occurs.  For this purpose, suppose that economic conditions unfold as in the Greenbook baseline (dotted lines) but that policymakers have  
taken out some insurance against the risk of recession  
by lowering the target funds rate to 1½ percent for  two quarters. 
In the Prompt Reversal case (solid lines), the strength  
of economic activity is assumed to be recognized  
quickly and the policy insura nce is then removed;  
indeed, policy is tightened somewhat further to offset  
the effects of the initial policy stimulus, and thereafter 
follows the prescriptions of the outcome-based rule.   In this case, the funds rate target rises almost a percentage point above the Greenbook baseline path by the end  
of this year.  With this policy path, core inflation  
remains very close to the Greenbook baseline while  
the unemployment rate only deviates temporarily. 
In contrast, in the case of Grad
ual Reversal  (dashed lines), 
the strength of economic activity is assumed to become evident only over a longer pe riod, and hence the policy  
insurance is removed over the course of a year rather  
than in a single quarter; th at is, after the first two  
quarters, the funds rate is adjusted according to the  
empirical outcome-based rule, which responds only gradually to incoming data.  This path of policy  
generates persistent deviat ions of unemployment and 
inflation from the Greenbook b aseline; even at the end  
of 2012, core inflation rema ins nearly a quarter point  
above the assumed long-run inflation goal of 1¾ percent.

this policy action, combined with those taken earlier, “should help to promote 
moderate growth over time and mitigate the risks to economic activity” but notes  
that “downside risks to growth remain”  and emphasizes—as in the January 22 
statement—that the Committee “will act in a timely manner as needed to address 
those risks.”   (19) Alternative B would likely be seen by market participants as broadly 
consistent with their current expectations for the funds rate, because a 50 basis point 
easing of the target funds rate at this meeting appears to be their modal expectation and because the risk assessment would probab ly be read as indicating a substantial 
probability of further easing.  Since investor s assign most of the remaining probability 
to a smaller easing, the adoption of this al ternative might cause a modest decrease in 
interest rates, a rally in equity prices, and perhaps some depreciation of the foreign exchange value of the dollar.     (20) If policymakers would prefer to move more aggressively to promote growth 
and mitigate downside risks, then they migh t choose to reduce the funds rate target  
by 75 basis points at this meeting, as in Alternative A .  Even after the funds rate cut 
on January 22, the real federal funds ra te exceeds the Greenbook-consistent estimate 
of short-run r* by about 60 basis points; thus, this degree of easing would be desirable 
if policymakers share the staff’s outlook bu t would prefer to bring the unemployment 
rate back to the NAIRU more quickly than in that outlook, an approach that might leave inflation close to 2 percent at the en d of the decade.  Following the January 22 
move with another aggressive easing at this  meeting might also be attractive from a 
risk management point of view—that is, Committee members may see benefits in 
moving more than they would perceive as n eeded merely to offset the weakening in 
the modal outlook.  With the housing cont raction steepening and financial stresses 
continuing to intensify, policymakers may be particularly concerned about reducing 
the likelihood of a nonlinear feedback cycle in which deteriorating macroeconomic 
Class I FOMC - Restricted-Controlled (FR)

conditions generate further strains in financial markets and augment pressures on 
banks’ balance sheets, further constricting th e supply of credit and hence leading to a 
fairly deep and long-lasting  recession.  This policy appr oach might be particularly 
appealing if members anticipated that th e Committee would be equally flexible and 
decisive in reversing the course of poli cy once downside risks to growth start to 
wane—as in the “Prompt Reversal” scen ario in the box on “Risk Management 
Strategies”—or upside risks to inflation st art to loom larger.  Members might also  
be attracted to this alternative if they believ e that a larger easing move at this meeting 
would diminish the probability that another rate cut would be needed over the 
subsequent intermeeting period. (21) The first portion of the rationale for Alternative A is identical to that of 
Alternative B, but this alternative elaborates  further about the prospects for inflation, 
pointing out that the projected moderation of inflation reflects “well-anchored  
inflation expectations, a projected leveling ou t of energy prices, and easing pressures 
on resource utilization,” and noting that “further increases in energy and commodity 
prices, as well as other factors, could put upward pressure on inflation.”  Of course, 
the Committee could choose simply to repeat  the inflation rationale given in the 
January 22 statement.  As in Alternative B, the risk assessm ent states that the stance  
of policy should help promote moderate gr owth and mitigate the downside risks to 
economic activity.  In light of the stronger policy action,  however, this alternative  
is somewhat less definitive regarding the magnitude of downside risks to growth, 
indicating that such risks “may well re main” and that the Committee will assess 
incoming information to determine “wheth er further action is needed to address 
those risks.”   (22) Although market participants appear to see only about one-tenth odds  
that the funds rate target will be reduced by  75 basis points at this meeting, the risk 
assessment in this alternative would likely be read as indicating a somewhat lower 
Class I FOMC - Restricted-Controlled (FR)

probability of further easing over the next few months.  Thus, this policy action might 
be viewed largely as a timing surprise, espe cially since futures co ntracts indicate that 
investors expect the funds rate to declin e to about 2¾ percent by the March FOMC 
meeting.  Consequently, the impact on Treasury coupon yields could be rather limited.  
Of course, this policy move might bolster  market confidence and help alleviate 
perceptions of tail risks to the macroeconomy, causing equity prices  to rise and credit 
spreads on corporate debt to narrow.  Howeve r, this alternative could also heighten 
concerns about the longer-term inflation outlook, in which case forward inflation compensation might rise noticeably further and the foreign exchange value of the 
dollar could depreciate. (23) If members are concerned that the stance of policy remains somewhat 
restrictive but would prefer a more increm ental approach in responding to incoming 
information, then the Committee could choose to reduce the funds rate target by  25 basis points at this meeting, as in Alternative C .  This alternative might be  
viewed as most consistent with the typical pattern of gradual funds rate adjustment  
in response to changes in resource utilization and core inflation.  Such gradualism 
reflects the usual pace of incoming info rmation regarding the appropriate policy 
stance and reduces the odds of sudden reversals in the path of policy.  Members  may also be concerned that more substantial policy accommodation could spark  
an increase in longer-term inflation expectations, as in the Greenbook’s “Unanchored 
Inflation Expectations” scenario.  Moreov er, given the challenges in monitoring 
underlying inflation expectations, such a development might not become apparent 
very quickly and could then be quite costly to reverse.  (24) The first portion of the rationale for Alternative C is identical to that of 
Alternatives A and B, but this alternativ e notes that upward pressure on inflation 
could result from “further increases in en ergy, commodity, and other import prices.”  
Moreover, in contrast to those two alternatives, the risk assessment in Alternative C 
Class I FOMC - Restricted-Controlled (FR)
30 of 38
   
makes no reference to mitigating the risks to economic activity.  The remainder of  
the risk assessment paragraph for this alte rnative is the same as in the January 22 
FOMC statement, reiterating that “appreciab le downside risks to growth remain”  
and that the Committee “will act in a timely manner as needed to address those risks.”    
(25) Market participants would be some what surprised by a 25 basis point 
reduction in the target federal funds rate at this meeting, beca use the Desk’s survey 
and market data suggest that market partic ipants are placing only about one-third 
odds on a 25 basis point easing, with virt ually all of the remaining probability  
assigned to larger moves of 50 or 75 basis points.  To be sure, the reference in the  
risk assessment to acting in a “timely man ner” may be read as pointing to a possible 
intermeeting easing of policy.  But, given the smaller-than-anticipated policy action  
at this meeting, financial markets might well conclude that further easing moves 
would be incremental.  Thus, Alternative C would probably induce a rise in short-
term interest rates; however, intermediate-t erm yields might rise less or perhaps even 
decline if investors concluded that a sluggish near-term pace of policy adjustment implied that even more easing would be needed down the road.  Equity prices would 
likely fall while credit spreads on corporate debt would widen.  At the same time,  
five-to-ten-year forward TIPS-based inflation compensation might retrace some of  its recent increase, and the foreign exchange va lue of the dollar could appreciate a bit.  
Moreover, given the highly skittish attitudes of investors and relatively illiquid trading conditions in some markets, policy surpri ses might well generate unusually large 
reactions in financial markets. (26) In view of policy actions to date, policymakers might prefer to wait  
for additional economic and financial information before taking any further policy  action, as in Alternative D .  Some policymakers may judge that the current softness 
in the economy is likely to be transitory and that ongoing financial developments are likely to have less effect on aggregate demand than anticipated by the staff and other 
Class I FOMC - Restricted-Controlled (FR)
31 of 38
   
forecasters.  In addition, monetary polic y has already been eased considerably, and 
significant fiscal stimulus seems likely to be enacted, perhaps reducing the need for 
further monetary accommodation.  Moreover, policymakers might be concerned 
about the extent to which recent elevated levels of inflation and forward inflation 
compensation might be pointing to a higher trajectory of prices going forward.   
This approach might also be appealing to  policymakers who prefer a more distinct 
downward tilt of the trajectory for inflation over the next few years than in the staff forecast, as in the optimal-control simulation with an inflation goal of 1½ percent.  
(27) The statement under Alternative D re iterates several elements of the 
rationale portion of the January 22 statemen t—including references to considerable 
stress in financial markets, tightened cred it conditions, and deepening of the  
housing contraction—but does not cite recent developments in labor markets.  
Because this alternative leaves the stance of policy unchanged, the statement simply 
indicates that “recent policy actions should promote moderate growth over time.”   
This alternative reaffirms the Committee’s ex pectation that inflation will moderate  
in coming quarters, but adds the same explanation as in Alternative C regarding  
the factors that could put upward pressure on inflation.  Moreover, with no change  
in policy and few economic data releases on the calendar between January 22  
and January 30, the assessment of risks in Alternative D is identical to that of  
the January 22 statement.  
(28) Alternative D could surprise and c onfuse market participants, who  
are virtually certain that the funds rate targ et will be cut at least 25 basis points  
at this meeting.  The absence of any poli cy action would be particularly difficult to 
understand in light of the January 22 FO MC statement, which noted “appreciable 
downside risks to growth” and emphasized that the Committee “will act in a timely 
manner as needed to address those risks. ”  While shorter-term interest rates  
would rise noticeably, investors would pr obably become more concerned about the 
Class I FOMC - Restricted-Controlled (FR)

economic outlook, leading to a further drop in longer-term Treasury yields, a marked 
widening of credit spreads on corporate de bt, and sharp declines in equity prices. 
Money and Debt Forecasts 
(29) Under the Greenbook projection, M2 is  expected to grow at about a  
5¼ percent rate in the current quarter, a bout a quarter point faster than the growth 
rate forecasted in December.  This pace would significantly exceed the 3¼ percent 
forecast for nominal GDP grow th this quarter.  The decline in
 velocity reflects  
the boost to money demand from the sharp decline in the opportunity cost resulting 
from monetary policy easing as well as th e unusually strong flows into money market 
mutual funds that have likely been prompt ed by the financial turmoil.  For 2008  
as a whole, M2 is forecast to expand at a 6 percent annual rate, considerably above  
the 3¾ percent expansion projected for nominal GDP.  With opportunity cost leveling off later this year and financial markets presumably becoming less volatile,  M2 is projected to expand at a 4¼ percent rate in 2009, in line with growth in  
nominal GDP.  (30) After advancing at an estimated 8¼ percent pace in
 2007, domestic 
nonfinancial sector debt is projected to sl ow to a 5 percent rate this year and to 
moderate further to an average rate of 4¾  percent in 2009.  The deceleration reflects  
a broad-based slowdown in borrowing by households, nonfinancial businesses, and 
state and local governments.  Household debt is projected to increase only modestly over the forecast period, restrained by the dampening effects on mortgage borrowing 
of falling house prices and weak home sales.  In addition, sluggish gains in household 
spending on durable goods and tighter standards and terms on consumer loans are 
expected to weigh on growth in consumer credit.  Business borrowing is expected to 
slow sharply as M&A and share repurchase  activity abates significantly.  The 
expansion of debt in the state and local government sector is also projected to

capital projects and advance refundings.  Th e difficulties of major bond insurers are 
expected to restrain municipal bond issuance somewhat in 2008.   By contrast, the 
growth of federal debt is expected to pick up in 2008, boosted in part by borrowing to 
fund the proposed economic stimulus package, and then to hold about steady in 2009.

Appendix A: Measures of the  Equilibrium Real Rate 
 
The equilibrium real rate is the real  federal funds rate that, if maintained, would be projected to return 
output to its potential level over time.   The short-run equilibrium rate is  defined as the rate that would 
close the output gap in twelve qua rters given the corresponding model’s projection of the economy.   
The medium-run concept is the value of  the real federal funds rate proj ected to keep ou tput at potential 
in seven years, under the assumption that monetary policy acts to bring actua l and potential output into 
line in the short run and then keeps them equal thereafter.  The TIPS-based factor model measure 
provides an estimate of market expectations for the real federal funds rate seven years ahead.  
 
The actual real federal funds rate is  constructed as the difference betw een the nominal rate and realized 
inflation, where the nominal rate is measured as the quarterly average of the observed federal funds rate, 
and realized inflation is given by the log difference between the co re PCE price index and its lagged 
value four quarters earlier.  For th e current quarter, the nominal rate is specified as the target federal 
funds rate on the Bluebook publication date.  For the current quarter and th e previous quarter, the 
inflation rate is computed using the sta ff’s estimate of the core PCE price index. 
 Confidence intervals reflect uncertainties about model specification, coefficients, and the level of 
potential output.  The final column of the table in dicates the values published in the previous Bluebook. 
  
Measure  Description 
Single-equation 
Model  The measure of the equilibrium real rate in the single-equation model is based on an 
estimated aggregate-demand relationship between  the current value of the output gap and 
its lagged values as well as the lagged va lues of the real federal funds rate. 
Small Structural 
Model  The small-scale model of the economy consists of equations for five variables: the output 
gap, the equity premium, the federal budget surp lus, the trend growth rate of output, and 
the real bond yield. 
Large Model 
(FRB/US) Estimates of the equilibrium real rate using FRB/US—the staff’s large-scale econometric 
model of the U.S. economy—depend on a very broad array of economic factors, some of 
which take the form of projected valu es of the model’s exogenous variables. 
Greenbook-
consistent  The FRB/US model is used in conjunction with an extended version of the Greenbook 
forecast to derive a Greenbook-consistent measure .  FRB/US is first add-factored so that 
its simulation matches the extended Greenbook forecast, and then a second simulation is 
run off this baseline to determine the value of the real federal funds rate that closes the 
output gap. 
TIPS-based 
Factor Model Yields on TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) reflect investors’ expectations of 
the future path of real interest rates, but also include term and liquidity premiums.  The 
TIPS-based measure of the equilibrium real ra te is constructed using the seven-year-ahead 
instantaneous real forward rate derived fro m TIPS yields as of the Bluebook publication 
date.  This forward rate is adjusted to remove estimates of the term and liquidity 
premiums based on a three-factor arbitrage -free term-structure model applied to TIPS 
yields, nominal yields, and inflation.  Because TIPS indexation is based on the total CPI, this measure is also adjusted for the me dium-term difference—projected at 40 basis 
points—between total CPI inflation and core PCE inflation.

Appendix B: Analysis of Policy Paths and Confidence Intervals 
 
Rule Specifications :  For the following rules, it denotes the federal funds rate for quarter t , while  
the explanatory variables include the staff’s projec tion of trailing four-quart er core PCE inflation ( πt), 
inflation two and three quarters ahead ( πt+2|t and π t+3|t), the output gap in the current period and one 
quarter ahead ( yt−*yt and y*
tt+1|−t1|ty+), and the three-quarter-ahead forecast of annual average GDP 
growth relative to potential ( Δ−4y*
tt+3|Δt34y+|t), and π* denotes an assumed value of policymakers’ 
long-run inflation objective.  The outcome-based a nd forecast-based rules were estimated using real-
time data over the sample 1988:1-2006:4; each specifi cation was chosen using the Bayesian information 
criterion. Each rule incorporates a 75 basis point shift in the interc ept, specified as a sequence of  
25 basis point increments during the first three quarters of 1998.  The first two simple rules were 
proposed by Taylor (1993, 1999), while  the third is a vari ant of the Taylor ( 1999) rule—introduced  
in the August Bluebook—with  a higher value of r*.  The prescriptions of the first-difference rule do  
not depend on assumptions regarding r* or the level of the output  gap; see Orphanides (2003).

FRB/US Model Simulations :  Prescriptions from the two empiri cal rules are computed using dynamic 
simulations of the FRB/US model, implemented as though the rule were followed starting at this FOMC 
meeting.  The dotted line labeled “Previous Bluebook” is  based on the current specification of the policy 
rule, applied to the previous Gr eenbook projection.  Confidence intervals are based on stochastic 
simulations of the FRB/US model with shocks drawn from the estimated residuals over 1986-2005.  
Information from Financial Markets :  The expected funds rate path is based on forward rate 
agreements, and the confidence intervals for this path are constructed using prices of interest rate caps. 
Near-Term Prescriptions of Simple Policy Rules :  These prescriptions are calculated using Greenbook 
projections for inflation and the output gap. Because the first-difference rule involves the lagged funds 
rate, the value labeled “Previous Bluebook” for the curr ent quarter is computed using the actual value  
of the lagged funds rate, and the one -quarter-ahead prescriptions are ba sed on this rule’s prescription for 
the current quarter.
