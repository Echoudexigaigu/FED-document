Recent Developments 
Summary 
(1) Market participants marked up the expected path of monetary policy 
substantially over the intermeeting period  in response to a number of factors, 
including speeches by Federal Reserve offi cials that were read as emphasizing 
concerns about the outlook for inflation; a sh arp rise in oil prices; economic data that, 
on balance, were interpreted as pointing  to a stronger outlook for growth; and 
improving conditions in financial markets.  Investors currently place high odds on the 
Committee leaving the target federal funds rate unchanged at the upcoming FOMC 
meeting, but also attach some probability to a 25 basis point increase.  Nominal 
Treasury yields rose notably in reaction to  the revisions to policy expectations and 
apparently to an increase in term prem iums.  TIPS-based measures of inflation 
compensation rose markedly, especially at shorter maturities, responding to sharply 
higher oil and agricultural commodity pric es.  Functioning of short-term funding 
markets showed improvement but conditions nonetheless remained strained.  Spreads 
of interbank term funding rates over comp arable-maturity overnight index swap (OIS) 
rates narrowed over the period.  Equity prices  were somewhat volatile, rising early in 
the intermeeting period before falling to end the period down appreciably; stock 
prices for investment banks registered significant declines amid renewed worries 
about their financial condition and future earnings prospects.  Spreads on both 
investment-grade and speculative-grade s ecurities narrowed a bit.  Bond issuance 
surged, but business lending by banks dece lerated and commercial paper outstanding 
declined.    Issuance of leveraged loans continued to be weak, although secondary-
market conditions improved modestly.  Th e trade-weighted index of the nominal Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) June 19, 2008

dollar against the currencies of the major trading partners of the United States 
increased 1 percent on net. 
 Monetary Policy Expectations and Treasury Yields 
(2) Although the FOMC’s decision at it s April meeting to reduce the target 
federal funds rate by 25 basis points was largely anticipated, some market participants 
had reportedly assigned some weight to no chan ge in the target rate.  As a result, rates 
on federal funds futures maturing through early next year fell 5 to 15 basis points on the announcement.
1  By contrast, over the remainder of the intermeeting period, the 
expected path of policy was marked up substantially in response to commentary by FOMC officials that was interpreted as em phasizing concerns about the outlook for 
inflation and generally stronger-than-expect ed economic data; a significant portion of 
the increase occurred in volatile trading over a few days in early June.  The revision to 
policy expectations also occurred against the backdrop of sharp increases in oil prices, 
which reportedly contributed to heighten ed concerns about the future path of 
inflation.  Judging from options on federal funds futures, investors attach about an 80 
percent probability to no change in the target rate at the upcoming FOMC meeting and 15 percent to a 25 basis point increase (Chart 1).  All respondents to the Desk’s 
survey of primary dealers expected no change in the target rate at the June meeting, and a substantial majority expected the FOMC  to keep rates on hold over the next 2 
to 3 meetings.  Futures quotes suggest that  investors now expect the federal funds 
rate to reach about 2½ percent by end of this year, and about 3½ percent by the end 
                                           
1 The effective federal funds rate averaged 1. 99 percent over the intermeeting period, but as 
has been the case in recent months, volatility was very elevated.  Over the period, the 
volume of long-term repurchase agreements (RPs) increased $5 billion.  The Desk redeemed 
$35 billion in Treasury securiti es and sold $35 billion of Tre asury securities on an outright 
basis to offset the provision of balances thro ugh various programs, including primary credit, 
the Primary Dealer Credit Facility, the Term Auction Facility, the single-tranche term RP 
program, and draws on foreign currency swap arrangements.

of 2009, about 45 and 65 basis points higher than at the time of the April meeting, 
respectively.  Desk survey respondents antici pated a much less steep path for policy, 
with the federal funds rate reaching 2¾ pe rcent only at the end of 2009.  The option-
implied distributions of the federal funds rate six and twelve months ahead have 
shifted to the right, and are now skewed to wards higher rates.  Policy uncertainty, as 
measured by the dispersion of these distributions, moved markedly higher over the intermeeting period, with much of the increa se coinciding with the sharp backup in 
policy expectations in early June. (3) Yields on nominal Treasury securities  rose sharply over the intermeeting 
period.  Two-year yields increased about 65  basis points and ten-year yields about 40 
basis points.  The increases were partly attribut able to the rise in the expected path for 
policy, but also appeared to reflect increase s in term premiums.  Liquidity improved in 
the Treasury market, but it remained impaired  relative to historical norms.  On most 
days, bid-asked spreads on on-the-run nominal securities were near the low end of their range since early August 2007.  In th e TIPS market, the yield on ten-year issues 
rose by about 20 basis points.  TIPS-based  inflation compensation rose sharply over 
the period, with the increase concentrated at shorter horizons.  Five-year inflation compensation adjusted for carry effects incr eased about 45 basis points.  In contrast, 
five-year inflation compensation five years forward was about flat.  Sharp advances in 
both near-term and far-term oil futures pric es and rises in agricultural commodities 
prices likely contributed substantially to th e rise in inflation compensation. (See box 
“Oil Prices and Inflation Compensation.”)   Probability distributions derived from 
inflation caps suggest an increase in both inflation expectations and uncertainty. (See box “Deriving Probability Densities for Inflation from Inflation Caps.”)  Survey

  to 4.1 percent in December 2005 an d to 5.2 percent in December 20007.      Note: The dashed lines denote 95 percent   
            confidence intervals for each coefficient. Oil Prices and Inflation Compensation
This box presents empirical estimates of the effects  
of oil price shocks on TIPS-based measures of inflation 
compensation.  Such effect s could reflect underlying 
shifts in market participants’ inflation expectations  or their uncertainty regarding the outlook for inflation.   
To examine this issue, daily changes in inflation 
compensation at a given horizon are regressed on  
daily changes in the one-year-ahead oil futures price, 
controlling for surprises in economic news releases  
and unanticipated monetary policy actions.  Inflation 
compensation at short horizons is measured by  the spread between nominal and indexed Treasury 
securities at a constant maturity of three years, while 
inflation compensation at intermediate and longer 
horizons is measured using spreads on three-year-
average forward rates at horizons of 4 to 6 years and  
7 to 9 years ahead, respectively.     
Using data since January 2004, these regressions indicate 
that oil price shocks have statistically significant effects 
on inflation compensation at all horizons (upper panel).  
Specifically, a 10 percent incr ease in the price of oil  
is associated with a rise of 12 basis points in near-term inflation compensation and a rise of about 2 to 3 basis 
points in forward inflation compensation at the 
intermediate and longer-term horizons. 
Subsample analysis indicates that the sensitivity of near-term inflation compensation  
to oil price shocks has increased markedly over the past few years, roughly in line  
with the increasing weight of en ergy prices in the CPI basket.
1  Indeed, the regression 
coefficient for the most recent sample (Janua ry to mid-June 2008) is about twice as  
large as for the 2004-2005 sample.  In contra st, the responsiveness of long-term forward 
inflation compensation has remained quite stable over this period, suggesting that there 
has been relatively little change in how oil price shocks influence investors’ expectations 
and uncertainty about the longer-term inflation outlook.

 fall Deriving probability densities fo r inflation from inflation caps 
 
Inflation de
rivatives markets have grown in recent years.  One such derivative 
is an inflation cap, which pays the holde r an amount equal to the difference between 
headline CPI inflation and a level specified in the contract (the “strike price”) times 
the notional value of the contract in each ye ar over the term of the contract.  Thus, an
inflation cap effectively prov ides the holder with insura nce against high inflation 
outcomes.  Although the inflation caps market is still nascent, with fairly limited 
trading activity, anecdotal information suggests that investor interest in inflation caps 
has picked up this year.   
 Prices of inflation caps at various stri ke prices and m
aturities can be used to 
construct implied probability density functions (pdfs) for inflation at selected 
horizons.  These pdfs are constructed assuming that investors are risk neutral and that 
inflation is the sum of two components: a stochastic long-run trend plus transitory shocks around that trend.
1  
 The figure below shows such pd fs for the one-year inflation rate five years 
ahead on selected recent dates.  These pdfs  have widened during 2008 and, since the 
April FOMC meeting, have also shifted to the right.  The widening of the pdfs suggests that uncertainty about long-run in flation outcomes has increased in recent 
months, and the rightward shift in the distri butions is consistent with some increase 
in inflation expectations.  However, two im portant caveats apply to this exercise.  
First, if investors are in fact risk averse, the widening of the pdfs and the rightward 
shift in the distributions could represent larger risk premiums that investors are 
willing to pay to hedge agains t the possibility of greater-th an-expected inflation in the 
future.  Second, the market is comparativel y small and illiquid, and the perceptions of 
inflation risk among investors in this marke t might not be representative of those of 
investors in the broader economy.  
 
 
 
1The assumption about the inflation proc ess is intended as a plausible charac terization of how investors might view 
inflation dynamics.  However, the re sults are robust to alternative assu mptions about the inflation process.

measures of inflation expectations were flat  to higher over the period, continuing the 
upward trend seen so far this year.2 
Money Markets 
(4) Functioning in  the interbank funding markets appeared to improve 
modestly, but conditions in those markets remained strained.  Spreads of one- and 
three-month interbank term funding rate s over comparable-maturity OIS rates 
declined over the intermeeting period (Chart 2).3  Market participants attributed part 
of the narrowing to the expansion in the credit extended through the Term Auction 
Facility (TAF) from $100 billion to $150 billion outs tanding.  European banks’ 
demand for dollar funding appeared to remain elevated relative to that of domestic 
banks.  Conditions in euro and sterling in terbank markets also remained strained, but 
were little changed from the time of the April FOMC meeting despite announcements 
of further write-downs in the first quarter by many European banks.   In contrast, 
implied rates from foreign exchange and cu rrency basis swaps indicate that European 
financial institutions may have appreciably increased their demand for dollar funding; demand was strong at dollar auctions offered by the European Central Bank and 
Swiss National Bank even as they increased the size of those aucti ons in line with the 
increases in the sizes of their dollar swap lines with the Federal Reserve to $50 billion 
                                           
2 An implied forward measure of inflation expectations beginning in five years and ending in 
ten years calculated using data for five- and ten-year inflation expectations from the Survey 
of Professional Forecasters fell 30 basis points from the first to the second quarter.  The 
Desk survey measure of five-year-forward infl ation expectations was little changed over the 
intermeeting period. 
3   In reaction to a widespread belief that ba nks on the Libor panel were understating their 
borrowing costs, on June 11 the British Bankers’ Association (BBA) announced a series of 
changes to Libor.  The changes included tighter scrutiny of the rates contributed by banks 
on the Libor panel, wider membership on the committee that oversees Libor, and potential 
increases in the number of contributors to some  rate-setting panels.  The BBA also indicated 
that it would investigate whether the rate-se tting mechanism stigmatizes contributors and 
examine the possibility of introducing a second rate-fixing process for U.S. dollar Libor rates 
after the U.S. market opening.

and $12 billion, respectively.  Liquidity in the market for interbank loans of more than 
three-month maturity reportedly remained thin and quoted spreads on those 
instruments were about unchanged.  Late in the period, some quarter-end pressures 
were evident in the pattern of money market rates, but anecdotal reports indicated 
that concerns about the quarter-end were not especially pronounced.   
(5) Depository institutions’ use of both overnight and term primary credit 
borrowing increased over the intermeeting period.  Borrowing has increased 
substantially since the spread between the pr imary credit rate and the target federal 
funds rate was reduced to 25 basis points in  March.  The volume of bids at TAF 
auctions have remained substantial, but st op-out rates have declined substantially 
relative to prior auctions to levels well below one-month Libor.  The fall in stop-out 
rates likely was a response to the increase in auction sizes.  Primary Dealer Credit 
Facility (PDCF) credit outstanding has declined by more than 50 percent over the 
intermeeting period. (See box “Developm ents in Federal Reserve Liquidity 
Facilities.”) 
(6) Conditions in repo markets seemed to improve a bit since April, although 
functioning of the repo marke ts for less-liquid collateral remained poor.  Supported 
by sales and redemptions from the System Open Market Account (SOMA), the 
overnight Treasury general collateral (GC) repo rate traded close to the federal funds 
rate during much of the intermeeting pe riod.  Overnight agency and agency-backed 
MBS repos generally traded at tight spreads to GC repo rates.  Dealer haircuts on non-Treasury repos were little changed at el evated levels.  Term Securities Lending 
Facility (TSLF) auctions were generally un dersubscribed over the intermeeting period, 
but the auction on June 12 was fully covere d, evidently reflecting increased demand 
ahead of quarter-end.

 Developments in Federal Reserve Liquidity Facilities   
The amount of primary credit outstanding (both overnight and term) 
and the number of institutions borrowing increased on net over the intermeeting period.  After reaching a peak of nearly $20 billion in late 
May, the amount of primary credit outstanding has hovered around 
$13.5 billion for the past two weeks.  Currently, 67 depository 
institutions (DIs) have outstanding pr imary credit loans, up from 44 at 
the time of the April FOMC meeting.  Although nearly 80 percent of 
current credit outstanding consists  of loans to a small number of 
branches and agencies of foreign banks, most borrowers are domestic banks and thrifts.  Primary credit borrowing picked up sharply in late March, after the spread of the primary credit rate to the target federal funds rate was lowered to 25 basis points and the maximum maturity of 
loans was increased to 90 days.  Fede ral Reserve Banks report that the 
domestic institutions borrowing include DIs with well diversified asset 
portfolios along with some that have relatively high concentrations of 
residential or commercial real estate  assets in areas where the housing 
market is most stressed.   
The total amount of bids at the four TAF auctions conducted over the 
intermeeting period remained elev ated, but stop-out rates declined 
substantially relative to prior auctions , likely in response to the increased 
auction sizes.  The percentage of  TAF credit outstanding that was 
awarded to branches and agencies of  foreign banks has progressively 
declined from about 85 percent at th e April 21 auction to 64 percent at 
the June 16 auction, perhaps partly in response to the expansion of the 
swap lines with the European Ce ntral Bank and the Swiss National 
Bank.   
Primary dealers have substantially reduced their reliance on the PDCF, 
and the amount outstanding at that facility has declined by more than 50 
percent over the intermeeting period, to about $8.5 billion.  In recent 
weeks, only three dealers have acce ssed the facility, and one of them 
accounts for the bulk of PDCF credit outstanding. 
The volume of securities lent through the TSLF declined, on net, over the 
intermeeting period, and all of the auctions but one had bid to cover 
ratios below one.  The auction on June 12 was the exception, with the 
increased demand reportedly relate d to somewhat higher financing 
concerns over quarter-end.  The reduced use of the facility and the trend 
of undersubscription of these auct ions likely reflected the improved 
conditions in funding markets over the intermeeting period.  Moreover, 
because spreads of non-Treasury re po rates over those on Treasury repo 
have narrowed and have frequently been smaller than the minimum fee for borrowing through the TSLF, the in centive for dealers to participate 
in the TSLF—to exchange non-Treasury collateral for Treasuries—has 
diminished.

Capital Markets 
(7) Broad equity price indexes fell 2 to  4 percent, on balance, over the 
intermeeting period.  Financial sector stoc ks significantly underperformed the broad 
indexes, partly reflecting renewed concerns  about the financial condition of some 
primary dealers, while energy stocks show ed significant increases.  Revisions to 
expected earnings were negative in the fina ncial sector; positive in the energy sector, 
largely a reflection of rising oil prices; and about flat in other non-financial sectors.  
Option-implied volatility on the S&P 500 reversed some of its decline over the 
preceding intermeeting period, an d is now near the middle of the elevated range seen 
since August 2007.  The spread between the twelve-month forward trend earnings-
price ratio for S&P 500 firms and the real long-term Treasury yield — a rough gauge 
of the equity risk premium — was little chan ged and remains near the upper end of its 
range over the past two decades.  Yields  on both investment-grade and speculative-
grade corporate bonds rose significantly over  the period, but by slightly less than 
yields on comparable-maturity Treasury yields, implying a further narrowing of 
spreads.  However, spreads remain elevated by  historical standards.  In the market for 
leveraged loans, spreads to Libor in the primary market stayed at high levels.  
Conditions in the secondary market, while still difficult, improved somewhat, with 
prices moving up a little and bid-asked spreads narrowing.  The improvement may be partly attributable to better market sentim ent as banks continued to reduce their 
backlogs of underwritten deals.  Implie d spreads on the LCDX indexes were little 
changed over the intermeeting period.  
(8) Several financial guarantors were downgraded by rating agencies over the 
intermeeting period.  The impact of th e downgrades on the municipal bond market 
has been limited, and ratios of municipal bo nd yields to comparable-maturity Treasury 
yields reversed their February and March ju mps in recent weeks.  Issuance of long-
term municipal bonds continued to be strong  in May, with some of this issuance 
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)

reflecting the refinancing of auction-rate se curities (ARS) whose auctions failed.  The 
impact of recent downgrades on financial in stitutions has been limited to date, but 
analysts anticipate further write-downs associated with these downgrades; additional 
downgrades or defaults by financial guaranto rs would likely generate significant losses 
for a handful of financial institutions. 
(9) Interest rates on 30-year fixed-rate conforming mortgages increased over 
the intermeeting period, leaving spreads over 10-year Treasury securities little changed 
(Chart 3).  Posted offer rates on 30-year ju mbo mortgages also rose, and such credit 
continued to be difficult to obtain.  Issu ance of agency residential mortgage-backed 
securities (MBS) remained strong.  Option-adjusted spreads on agency MBS widened on net over the intermeeting period.  Credit default swap (CDS) indexes on the 
government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs), Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, edged up.  
The temporary increase in the conforming  loan limit included in the economic 
stimulus bill has, as yet, had little effect, with the GSEs purchasing small volumes and 
issuing no securities backed by such loan s.  Issuance of GNMA securities, which are 
backed by FHA and VA loans, has increase d markedly since the end of 2007.  The 
increase may reflect substitution into such loans by borrowers unable readily to obtain 
mortgage credit.  By contrast, issuan ce of private-label RMBS backed by 
nonconforming loans was virtually nonexistent in April, as was issuance of commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS).  Spreads on CDS indexes for CMBS 
remained at historically high levels.  (10) Conditions in other consumer lend ing markets were generally good.  
Issuance of consumer asset-backed securiti es (ABS) over the intermeeting period was 
strong, led by an increase in issuance of  paper backed by auto loans.  Spreads on 
consumer ABS began to narrow.  Anecdotal reports suggested that policy actions by 
Congress and the Department of Education helped assuage concerns about student

designed to support the secondary market and it remains to be seen whether these 
steps will spur a broader recovery in the student loan market. 
Foreign Developments 
(11) Foreign cr
edit markets were relatively stable, but foreign bond yields rose 
noticeably over the period.  Although the ce ntral banks of the major foreign industrial 
economies kept policy rates on hold, foreign central bank officials, like their U.S. 
counterparts, expressed concern about inflationary pressures, leading market 
participants to significantly revise upward  their expected paths for future monetary 
policy.  Yields on sovereign benchmark bond s rose 20 to 60 basis points in those 
countries (Chart 4).  The trade-weighted index of the nominal dollar against the 
currencies of the major trading partners of  the United States increased 1 percent on 
net and tended to move with market perceptions the relative economic strength of the U.S. versus foreign economies and the relative stances of monetary policies.
5  Overall 
European equity indexes declined between 6 and 8 percent, led by financial stocks, 
which fell as banks announced further writ e-downs for the first quarter, but Japan’s 
headline equity indexes rose about 2 percent.   
(12) A number of central banks in emergi ng m
arket economies tightened policy 
over the intermeeting period in order to co mbat rising food and energy prices, and 
yields on local-currency bonds have risen.  Rising energy costs pushed some countries 
to scale back fuel subsidies, adding to short-term inflationary pressures.  Stock markets in the emerging economies genera lly declined between  1 and 10 percent, 
                                           
4 On May 7, the President sign ed into law the Ensuring Cont inued Access to Student Loans 
Act of 2008.  The act gave the Department of Education new authority to purchase Stafford 
and PLUS loans for the 2008-09 academic yea r.  The Department of Education held a 
briefing on May 20 to present its proposals for implementing its new authority.   
5 There were no foreign official purchases or sales of dollars by reporting central banks in 
industrial countries during the intermeeting period.

dollar against the currencies of the other important trading partners of the United 
States fell slightly.  The dollar has depreci ated by 1½ percent against the renminbi 
since mid-May after remaining essentially un changed against that currency for most of 
April, but has appreciated against most other emerging Asian currencies.    
Debt and Money 
(13) The debt of domestic nonfinancial sector s is projected to be expanding at a 
3¾ percent annual rate in the second quarter, down from the 6 percent pace recorded 
in the first quarter (Chart 5).  The slow down appears to be broad based, with 
household, business, and federal government debt all declining.  Home mortgage debt 
is estimated to have continued its recent slowdown, in part reflecting falling house prices.  Debt in the nonfinancial business sector is on track to decelerate to a 5½ 
percent annual rate, as a decline in comme rcial paper issuance and a reduction in C&I 
loan growth more than offset surges in both investment-grade and speculative-grade 
bond issuance.  The slowdown in C&I lendin g in part reflects a continued low pace of 
leveraged buyouts and mergers and acquisitions  as well as tighter credit standards and 
terms at banks.  While bond issuance was strong among energy-producing firms, 
issuance more broadly may have been boos ted by the stability of bond yields and 
spreads and some substitution for commercia l paper.  Issuance of leveraged loans 
reportedly continued to be very weak over the intermeeting period, as banks 
continued to work down their backlogs of previously underwritten loans.  Issuance of 
collateralized loan obligations (CLOs) continued to be extremely weak.   
(14) M2 grew at a sluggish 1¾ percent average rate over April and May, down 
substantially from the strong expansion in the first quarter, which was likely a 
consequence of investors s eeking safety and liquidity.  The deceleration was broad 
based, and was led by a sharp decline in the growth of retail money market mutual

flows into bond mutual funds and a resumpti on of flows into equity funds following 
the outflows seen earlier in the period of financial turm oil.  Small time deposits 
contracted, as the spreads of rates paid on these deposits relative to those on other 
deposits declined.  Liquid deposit growth slowed, although monthly figures revealed 
an increase from April to May, perhaps in part reflecting receipt of economic stimulus 
payments in the latter month.  Currency ex panded slightly on balance over the two

Economic Outlook  
(15)  Over the intermeeting period, incomi ng economic data have been much 
stronger on balance than expected by th e staff, and the Greenbook forecast for 
real activity over the first half of the year has accordingly been marked up 
appreciably.  However, the staff still ex pects that ongoing strains in financial 
markets, combined with the recent surge in o il prices, will restrain real activity in 
the medium term.  At the same time, hi gher energy costs also point to more 
inflationary pressures this year and ne xt.  Against this backdrop, the Greenbook 
forecast is now conditioned on an assumption that the target federal funds rate will 
be held at 2 percent this year and that poli cy will then be tightened by a total of 75 
basis points over 2009.  Long-term Treasury yields are projected to edge down this 
year and next because the staff assumes le ss tightening of monetary policy than 
investors apparently anticipate and because term premiums are expected to decline.  Stock prices are expected to incr ease at an annual rate of about 7 percent 
over the remainder of this year and 12 pe rcent next year, as the equity premium 
falls towards its long-run mean in response to dissipating macroeconomic risks.  
The real foreign exchange value of the dollar is assumed to depreciate at a rate of 3 
percent per annum over the projection period .  Oil futures prices rose sharply over 
the intermeeting period, and the futures curve shifted from sloping down to being 
essentially flat.  In line with these quote s, the price of West Texas intermediate 
crude oil is expected to remain around its current level of $135 per barrel.   
(16) In this Greenbook forecast, real GDP is projected to expand at an 
annual rate of about 1¾ percent in the current quarter, 3 percentage points higher 
than in the April projection.  The staff sees a part of the recent unexpected 
strength as reflecting a shift in the timing  of demand, and the growth forecast for 
the remainder of this year and for 2009 has been marked down a little.  The 
economy is now expected to expand at about a ¾ percent annual pace over the 
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)

second half of the year, re flecting the continuing drag from rising energy prices, 
tight credit conditions, and the decline in residential investment.  As these effects 
wane in 2009, economic growth picks up to about a 2½  percent pace, roughly in 
line with the staff’s upward ly revised estimate of the growth rate of potential 
output.  The revision to the second-quart er growth forecast leaves the level of 
output only half a percent below potential at mid-year, a notably smaller gap than 
in the April Greenbook; however, the proj ected gap widens noticeably over time 
and by late next year is essentially unchan ged from the time of the last meeting.  
The unemployment rate is projected to hover just below 5¾ percent through the end of next year ―nearly a percentage point above the staff’s estimate of the 
NAIRU.  The forecast for headline inflation has been marked up since the April 
Greenbook, largely owing to the further in creases in energy and other commodity 
prices.  Total PCE inflation is projected  to average about 4½ percent over the 
second half of 2008 before falling to a bit above 2 percent in 2009.  The staff 
forecast for core PCE inflation is around  2¼ percent both this year and next.  
Lower-than-expected readings on core inflation in the incoming data were offset 
by the upward pressure from rising energy  prices on core inflation in the second 
half, leaving the forecast for 2008 as a whole unrevised.  However, the staff’s 
projection for core inflation in 2009 is ¼ percentage point higher than in April. 
(17) The staff’s forecast has been exte nded beyond 2009 using the FRB/US 
model with adjustments to ensure consistency with the staff’s assessment of longer-run trends.  The extended forecast embeds several key assumptions: Monetary policy aims to stabilize PCE infl ation in the long run at a level of 1¾ 
percent; trend multifactor productivity grows a bit above 1 percent per year; the 
real value of the dollar depreciates steadily at about 1¼ percent per year; fiscal policy is essentially neutral; and energy prices remain roughly constant, but at a 
higher level than in the April projection.  With energy prices higher and resource 
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)

slack dissipating more slowly, the forecast trajectories for both PCE inflation and 
unemployment through 2012 are both above those in the April forecast.  The extended period of economic slack drives  PCE inflation down to 1¾ percent by 
the end of 2012, and the federal funds rate moves up to 4¼ percent.  Real GDP increases at an average annual rate of  3 percent from 2010 to 2012—nearly ½ 
percentage point above its projected potential  growth rate over that period.  This 
allows the unemployment rate to decline to just above 4¾ percent ―the staff’s 
estimate of the NAIRU—by the end of the extended forecast. 
Monetary Policy Strategies   
(18) As indicated in Chart 6, the Greenbook-consistent measure of short-run 
r* now stands at -0.1 percent, nearly half a percentage point higher than in the 
April Bluebook, reflecting the upward revision to the staff’s assessment of 
aggregate demand in response to incomi ng economic data.  The FRB/US model-
based measure of short-run r* is essentially unchanged at 0.4 percent, as a higher 
value of the equity premium offsets the somewhat stronger initial conditions for aggregate demand.
6  The other two model-based estimates of short-run r* are also 
roughly unchanged from April and continue to span a wide interval, currently -0.6 percent to 2.2 percent.  The actual value of the real federal funds rate is now -0.2 
percent if measured on a basis that is methodologically consistent with the 
assumptions used in the model-based estimates of r*, that is, using realized core 
PCE inflation over the past four quarter s as a proxy for expected inflation.  
However, alternative estimates of the actual real rate—introduced in this 
Bluebook—highlight the extent to which an estimate of the real rate is sensitive to 
                                           
6  The FRB/US model-based estimate of r* shown in the April Bluebook treated the 
Greenbook projection through 2008:Q2 as actual da ta, while the current estimate is based on 
a simulation that treats the staff forecast thro ugh the third quarter as data.  This difference 
accounts for the upward revi sion to the equity premium.

the use of alternative proxies for expected  inflation.  For example, the real funds 
rate is about 1 percentage point lowe r when based on over all PCE inflation.7 
(19) As shown in Chart 7, the recent upward shift in the projected path of oil 
prices has had a marked influence on th e optimal control simulations of the 
FRB/US model; compared with those in  April, these simulations portray a 
noticeable worsening of the tradeoff be tween unemployment and inflation and 
suggest a substantially tighter path of mone tary policy over much of the next three 
years. 8  (The initial value of the federal funds rate is much lower this round, since 
the simulations now take the lower level of  the actual funds rate in the current 
quarter as given.)  For an inflation goal of  1½ percent (the left-hand set of charts), 
the optimal funds rate climbs from the curr ent target rate of 2 percent to about 3 
percent by the end of 2010—about 75 ba sis points higher than in the April 
Bluebook—and then gradually rises to nearly  4 percent by 2012.  With an inflation 
goal of 2 percent (the right-hand set of charts), the funds rate remains close to its 
current value through mid-2010 and then ri ses to above 4 percent by the end of 
the simulation.  Under either inflation go al, the unemployment rate declines more 
slowly back towards the long-run NA IRU than in the previous Bluebook, 
reflecting a tighter average stance of monetary policy over the simulation period.  
                                           
7 Care should be used in comparing the new measu res of the actual real federal funds rate to 
the r* values shown here.  In order to make such a comparison, the calculation of r* needs to 
be adjusted to put it on the sam e basis as the measure of the actual real federal funds rate to 
be used.  In addition, the new measures of the actual real federal funds rate based on 
headline inflation are more volatile than th e measure based on core inflation because they 
are influenced to a greater extent by potentially large swings in energy prices.  As a result, it 
may be preferable to average the values of th e actual real federal funds rate over several 
quarters before making the comparison to r*. 
8  In these simulations, policymakers place equa l weight on keeping core PCE inflation close 
to a specified goal, on keep ing unemployment close to the long-run NAIRU, and on 
avoiding changes in the nominal federal funds rate.  Moreover, policymakers and 
participants in financial markets are assumed to understand fully the forces shaping the 
economic outlook, whereas households and firms fo rm their expectations using more limited 
information.

Even with a softer labor market, however , the trajectory for core PCE inflation 
from 2009 through the end of 2011 is near ly ¼ percentage point higher than in 
April, reflecting the effects of higher en ergy prices and somewhat higher long-run 
inflation expectations.  (See box “O il Shocks and Monetary Policy.”) 
(20) As depicted in Chart 8, the outcome-based monetary policy rule 
prescribes a funds rate that stays around  2 percent until early 2009 and then rises 
to a plateau of about 3½ percent fr om 2010 onwards.  Financial markets 
incorporate a higher path:  Investors anticipate that the funds rate will reach 3½ 
percent by late 2009 and then rise to about 4½ percent during 2011.  Options 
prices suggest that investors’ confidence intervals surrounding their monetary policy forecasts have widened significantly.   The near-term prescriptions from the 
simple policy rules proposed by Taylor ( 1993, 1999) are ¼ to ½ percentage point 
higher than in the April Bluebook, reflecting a modestly narrower output gap as well as somewhat higher core inflation.  The Taylor (1999) rule places relatively 
greater weight on the output gap than do es the 1993 version and hence prescribes 
a somewhat lower funds rate.
 9  Both versions prescribe funds rates that are 
noticeably higher than the expectations of financial market participants.  The 
prescriptions from the first-difference rule  are significantly lower than shown in 
the April Bluebook, reflecting the policy inertia of this rule. 
                                           
9  Starting in this Bluebook, prescriptions  from the Taylor (1999) rule with higher r* will no 
longer be presented in Chart 8.  The rati onale for the use of such a specification was 
associated with higher productivi ty growth rates than the staff anticipates for coming years.

Imperfect credibilityOil Shocks and Monetary Policy 
For an oil-importing economy, an increase in energy prices tends to reduce economic growth 
and boost inflation.  Given thes e opposing tendencies, the implicat ions for the optimal path of 
policy can be determined only through use of  a specific model and an assumed objective 
function.  In this box, a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium  
model developed by the staff is used to consider the optimal 
policy response to a permanent 50 percent rise in the real price 
of oil.  In the model, inflation is determined by a Phillips curve 
tradeoff between current inflation and current output, with  forward-looking inflation expectations.  All else equal, core  
prices rise in response to an oil price shock because higher  
energy costs push up marginal costs at any given level of  
output.  The central bank is assumed to have the objective  of minimizing squared deviations  of inflation from a target  
level and output from potential.
1   
 
 
 
 
1 A detailed analysis of the implications of an increase  in energy prices for the economy and monetary policy is 
presented in the memo to the Committee, “Macroeconomic  and Monetary Policy Implications of Rising Oil 
Prices,” that will be distributed on June 20, 2008. In the first simulation, the cen tral bank’s commitment to the 
optimal policy – and to a fixed long-run inflation target – is  
assumed to be fully credible (solid lines).  Two features of  
this simulation are critical for understanding the responses  
of inflation and output.  First, taking expected inflation as  
given, the central bank raises  the funds rate (top panel),  
thereby pushing output below potential (middle panel) and  restraining the rise in core infl ation (lower panel).  Second,  
the central bank, by committing to  return inflation to target  
relatively quickly – and even to moving it somewhat below  
target for a time – limits the e ffect of the shock on inflation  
expectations.  As a result, wa ge and price setters choose  
smaller increases in wages and prices in the near term,  
reducing the effect of the oil sh ock on inflation.  To implement  
this policy, however, the central bank must keep output a bit  
below potential for a protracted period. 
In the second simulation, policymakers are assumed to be  
unable to commit credibly to future policy actions or to the  
long-run inflation target, and he nce the oil price shock induces  
a long-lasting rise in the privat e sector’s perception of the central 
bank’s inflation target.  As denot ed by the dashed lines, policy

considerably further than under commitment, output shows a sharper initial contraction, and 
inflation rises by more and remains el evated for a protracted period.   
  
 Oil Shocks and Monetary Policy (Cont.) 
in this simulation is tightened considerably further than under commitment, output shows a 
sharper initial contraction, and inflation rises by more and remains elevated for a protracted 
period.   
Thus, the appropriate policy following an oil price shock depends on the credibility of the 
central bank.  With credibility, the central bank  needs to raise the federal funds rate only about 
25 basis points in response to th e specified shock, and it gradually returns the rate to baseline 
over about two years.  The resulting cumulative loss in output is fairly small, though the output 
gap closes only gradually.  Inflati on rises about a third of a percen tage point before falling a bit 
below target by year three.   By contrast, in the simulation without full credibility, the central 
bank must raise the federal funds rate more than  75 basis points following the increase in oil 
prices.  As a result of this larger policy move, ou tput falls significantly further than in the case 
with credibility before rebounding.  Despite the larger downturn, inflation rises about half a 
percentage point and returns to near its ba seline level only after about five years.

Short-Run Policy Alternatives  
(21)  This Bluebook presents three policy alternatives for the Committee’s 
consideration, summarized in Table 1.  Under Alternative A, the Committee would 
reduce the federal funds rate target by 25  basis points to 1¾ percent, and its 
statement would suggest that the furthe r easing of policy was motivated by a 
relatively downbeat assessment of the grow th outlook.  Under Alternative B, the 
target would be maintained at 2 percent,  but the statement would point both to 
somewhat diminished downside risks to growth and increased upside risks to 
inflation. Alternative C envisions a 25 basis points tightening to 2¼ percent; its 
statement expresses continued concern about inflation, but does not strongly 
suggest that further policy firming is in train.   (22) Given the recent sharp increase in pr ices of energy and agricultural 
commodities, inflation is likely to pick up  in the very near term.  Accordingly, 
whereas all three alternatives retain the language from the April statement that “the Committee expects inflation to moderate,” th e time reference for this prediction is 
changed from “in coming quarters” to “later  this year and next year,” hinting that 
the moderation in inflation may be somewh at longer in coming.  None of the 
alternatives provides any explicit we ighting of the risks to the Committee’s 
objectives.  As usual, the Committee could formulate its statement using language from more than one alternative.  Table 1 may need to be modified once participants have submitted their economic projections in order to ensure 
consistency between the draft statements and participants’ projections and 
accompanying narratives. (23) If the Committee reads the incoming information as pointing to growth 
risks that are a bit less skewed to the down side than in April and inflation risks that 
are a bit more tilted toward the upside, th en it may wish to couple an unchanged 
stance of policy at this meeting with the statement proposed for Alternative B .  In

2. Recent information indicates that 
economic activity remains weak. 
Household and business spending has 
been subdued and labor markets have softened further. Financial markets remain under considerable stress, and 
tight credit conditions and the deepening 
housing contraction are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters. Recent information indicates that economic activity has remained
 weak in 
recent months.  Although consumer 
spending appears to have firmed 
somewhat, residential investment has 
continued to contract sharply  and labor 
markets have softened further. Financial markets remain under considerable stress, and tight credit conditions and the deepening housing contraction are likely 
to weigh on economic growth over the 
next few quarters. Recent information indicates that overall
 
economic activity continues to expand, partly 
reflecting some firming in  household 
spending.  However , labor markets have 
softened further and  financial markets 
remain under considerable stress.  Tight 
credit conditions, the ongoing  housing 
contraction, and the rise in energy prices  are 
likely to weigh on economic growth over the 
next few quarters.

Rationale 3. Although readings on core inflation 
have improved somewhat, energy and other commodity prices have increased, and some indicators of inflation 
expectations have risen in recent months. 
The Committee expects inflation to moderate in coming qua rters, reflecting a 
projected leveling-out of energy and other 
commodity prices and an easing of 
pressures on resource utilization. Still, uncertainty about the inflation outlook remains high. It will be necessary to 
continue to monitor inflation 
developments carefully. Although energy prices have increased further
 and some indicators of inflation 
expectations have risen in recent months, core inflation has been stable of late
. The 
Committee expects inflation to moderate later this year and next year
, reflecting a 
projected leveling-out of energy prices and an easing of pressures on resource 
utilization. Still, uncertainty about the 
inflation outlook remains high. It will be necessary to continue to monitor inflation developments carefully. The Committee expects inflation to moderate later this year and next year.  
However, in light of the continued increases 
in the prices of energy and some other 
commodities and the elevated state of  some 
indicators of inflation expectations, uncertainty about the inflation outlook remains high. 
 
 Overall
 inflation has been elevated , energy 
prices have continued to increase , and some 
indicators of inflation expectations have 
risen further .  The Committee expects 
inflation to moderate later this year and next 
year, partly reflecting today’s policy action .  
Still, uncertainty about the inflation outlook remains high. It will be necessary to 
continue to monitor inflation developments 
carefully. 
Assessment 
of Risk 4. The substantial easing of monetary 
policy to date, combined with ongoing measures to foster market liquidity, 
should help to promote moderate growth 
over time and to mitigate risks to 
economic activity.  The Committee will continue to monitor economic and 
financial developments and will act as 
needed to promote sustainable economic growth and price stability. The substantial easing of monetary policy to date, combined with ongoing measures to foster market liquidity, should help to 
promote moderate growth over time and

Committee will continue to monitor economic and financial developments and 
will act as needed to promote sustainable 
economic growth and price stability. The substantial easing of monetary policy to date, combined with ongoing measures to foster market liquidity, should help to

Although downside risks to growth remain, 
they appear to have diminished somewhat, 
and the upside risks to near-term inflation 
and inflation expectations have increased .  
The Committee will continue to monitor economic and financial developments and will act as needed to promote sustainable 
economic growth and price stability. 
 Future policy adjustments will depend on 
the evolution of the outlook for both 
inflation and economic growth, as implied 
by incoming information on the economy 
and financial conditions.  
 
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)

view of the recent household and busine ss spending data, as well as some 
incremental improvement in financial cond itions over the intermeeting period, the 
Committee may now believe that the real federal funds rate is near its equilibrium 
level.  Indeed, the real federal funds ra te based on lagged four-quarter core PCE 
inflation is now very close to its Greenbook -consistent equilibrium value (Chart 6).  
Thus, although the current level of inflat ion may be seen as somewhat elevated 
relative to the Committee’s longer-run objectives, members may judge that the current stance of policy is consistent with  a modal outlook for a gradual closing of 
the output gap and modest downward pressu re on core inflation over the next few 
years.  If members anticipate that the factors that are currently restraining 
economic growth will gradually dissipate go ing forward, then they may believe that 
policy ought to remain on hold for a while, before gradually beginning to firm.  
Indeed, the optimal-control simulation with an inflation goal of 2 percent, shown 
in Chart 7, prescribes a trajectory for the target funds rate that hovers around the 
current target for the next year or so and subsequently rises.  These considerations 
might argue for an unchanged stance of po licy for the time being, coupled with a 
statement that suggests that policy is mo re likely to firm going forward than to 
ease.  Members may also see the current constellation of risks as suggesting that 
policy should stand pat for now.  Alth ough recent developments imply some 
diminution in the risk of an adverse f eedback loop between financial markets and 
the real economy, downside risks to growth  persist:  Housing markets remain very 
weak, labor markets have deteriorated furthe r, and record energy prices are likely 
to weigh on consumer sentiment and overal l growth.  On the other hand, inflation 
risks appear to have increased:  Rising energy prices and somewhat less resource slack than had been expected may be seen as adding to inflationary pressures, and 
many indicators of inflation expectations have drifted up this year ―a trend that has 
continued to some extent since the last FOMC meeting.  With  these crosscurrents, 
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)
31 of 41
   
the Committee may view the current degree of monetary policy accommodation as 
appropriate and wish to allow time for more information to accumulate before 
adjusting the stance of policy in either direction.   
(24) The discussion of the growth outl ook in the statement proposed for 
Alternative B replaces the assessment in  the April FOMC statement that economic 
growth remains weak by noting instead that  overall economic activity continues to 
expand, and the firming in consumer spen ding data is cited as providing some 
support to aggregate demand.  However,  the discussion of the outlook for 
economic activity retains some of the more  downbeat language from the previous 
statement, and adds the rise in energy pric es to the list of factors that are seen as 
likely to restrain growth going forward.  The housing contraction is described as “ongoing” rather than “deepening” to av oid the suggestion that housing markets 
are deteriorating more sharply than before.  Meanwhile, the inflation paragraph has 
a more hawkish tone than in the April statement.  The observation that “readings on core inflation have improved somewhat” is  deleted in light of the fact that core 
inflation readings moderated during th e spring but have flattened out more 
recently.  The statement suggests that in flation will moderate, but, unlike the 
previous statement, omits discussion of th e economic forces that might cause this 
to occur.  Instead, the continued rise in energy and commodity prices and some 
indications of heightened inflation expect ations are cited as factors that have 
increased the uncertainty about inflation prospects.  Although agricultural commodity prices have increased furthe r since the last FOMC meeting, other 
commodity prices, including those of many metals, have declined markedly.  
Accordingly, the draft language points to further increases in the prices of “energy 
and some other commodities.”  The balance of risks assessment is unchanged from 
April, except for the addition of a senten ce that judges that there are downside 
risks to growth ―which appear to have diminished somewhat ―and upside risks to 
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)
32 of 41
   
near-term inflation and inflation expect ations.  The two opposing risks are not 
explicitly compared, but since the sentence  ends on the discussion of upside risks 
to inflation, markets may read it as sugges ting that increased upside inflation risks 
are now the greater policy concern of the Committee. 
(25) Futures and options quotes suggest that investors think it highly 
probable that policy will be left unchan ged at this meeting, but expect policy 
tightening to begin later this year, perh aps as soon as the August meeting.  The 
combination of an unchanged funds rate and the slight implicit tilt towards upside risks envisioned under Alternative B s eems broadly consistent with these 
expectations, though it may cause investors to push back their expectations for the 
onset of policy tightening a bit.  Short- term interest rates might edge down, but 
longer-term rates would probably be little changed.  (26) If, in view of recent developments, the Committee judges that the 
growth outlook has improved appreciably or  that inflationary pressures have risen 
significantly, then it may prefer to tighte n policy by 25 basis points at this meeting, 
as in Alternative C .  Also, members may see prompt er firming than assumed in 
the Greenbook as appropriate if they are more optimistic than the staff about 
growth prospects in the second half of the year ―as they were in their economic 
projections in April.  Indeed, the current  stance of monetary policy might now be 
viewed as giving excessive support to aggregate demand ―some measures of real 
short-term interest rates have declined further over the intermeeting period, and 
members may believe that this will ha ve a larger effect on spending than 
envisioned by the staff.   Risk considerations also might argue for beginning to 
firm policy relatively soon.  In particular, since last August, the Committee has 
eased policy aggressively, in part to miti gate downside risks to growth stemming 
from financial market turmoil.  Howeve r, financial market conditions have 
improved somewhat in recent months:  Risk spreads have generally declined, bond 
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)
33 of 41
   
issuance has picked up, and many financial institutions have been successful in 
raising new capital.  In these circum stances, the Committee might see it as 
important to be prompt in reversing the earlier aggressive easing of policy.  
Members may also be worried that the rece nt rise in many measures of inflation 
expectations could presage a more seriou s unmooring of inflation expectations 
that would prove costly to reverse later,  along the lines of the “Higher Inflation 
Expectations” scenario.  In particular, members might be concerned that, in 
current circumstances, the Committee could be perceived as willing to tolerate the 
inflationary consequences of higher ener gy prices and less resource slack.  Also, 
they may think that heightened inflation pressures could persist to a greater degree than incorporated in the staff forecast:  O il prices have soared over the last year, 
even as futures quotes consistently implied that they were about to level out.  Members may prefer a tighter stance of poli cy if they are worried that this pattern 
could continue (along the lines of th e “Ongoing Commodity Price Pressures” 
scenario), or if they believe that the pass- through of rising food and energy prices 
into core inflation may turn out to be grea ter than envisioned by the staff.  Finally, 
the Committee might share the staff’s assessment of the underlying forces shaping the economy, but may prefer a tighter stance of policy in order to foster a more 
rapid moderation in inflation than is foreseen in the staff forecast.   
(27) The discussion of economic activity  in the proposed statement for 
Alternative C is identical to that in Alternative B.  The relatively downbeat 
assessment of the growth outlook might suggest to markets that adoption of this alternative did not necessarily represent th e start of a rapid firming in policy.  
However, the inflation paragraph in Altern ative C points to the elevated level of 
headline inflation and acknowledges that so me indicators of inflation expectations 
have increased further ―referring to the increase in short-term inflation 
compensation and in some short-term surv ey measures of inflation expectations 
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)
34 of 41
   
over the intermeeting period.  Under this alternative, the firming in policy would 
be cited as a factor that the Committee expects to cause inflation to moderate.  
However, the risks that attend this expect ation would be highlighted by indicating 
that “uncertainty about the inflation outlook remains high” and that inflation developments will continue to be monitored carefully, as in the April FOMC statement.  The final paragraph of Al ternative C has no balance of risks 
assessment, but simply notes that “futur e policy adjustments will depend on the 
evolution of the outlook for both  inflation and economic growth.” 
(28) Investors place only small odds on a rate  hike at this meeting, and thus 
they would be surprised by the adoption of Alternative C.  The expected path of policy over coming quarters woul d likely be marked up somewhat, 
notwithstanding the relatively pessimistic growth paragraph and the absence of any explicit mention of inflation risks.  Acco rdingly, short-term interest rates would 
rise and equity prices would fall.  There is a risk that these moves could be quite 
pronounced if investors interpreted the adoption of this alternative as signaling a 
substantially more rapid pace of policy ti ghtening than had been anticipated.  
However, longer-term nominal interest rates and inflation compensation might 
decline if the Committee’s decision caused investors to mark down their expectations for inflation at longer horiz ons.  The foreign exchange value of the 
dollar would probably appreciate.  Conditio ns in short-term funding markets could 
worsen once again.   (29) If the Committee remains particularly worried about downside risks to 
the outlook for economic activity, then it  may prefer to ease policy by another 
quarter point at this meeting, as in Alternative A .  The unemployment rate has 
increased sharply in recent months; in the past, such sharp increases have always been accompanied by recessions.  Mortgage rates and corporate bond yields have risen over the intermeeting period, tighte ning financial conditions and adding to 
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)
35 of 41
   
the restraint on aggregate demand.  Members may also view financial market 
functioning as still quite fragile:  Shor t-term funding markets remain strained, 
financial firms’ share prices have fallen sharply over the intermeeting period, and 
some financial institutions have reported large losses and their credit ratings have 
been downgraded.  A little more policy accommodation may be seen as appropriate insurance against the macroec onomic consequences of the risk that 
financial market functioning might dete riorate once again.  The Committee might 
also be concerned that the reasonably firm consumer spending data in the second quarter might simply reflect a greater degree of anticipatory spending by 
households of their fiscal stimulus rebates than assumed in the staff forecast, implying that growth in the second half of the year could be lower as this effect 
wanes.  Indeed, the apparent resilience in economic activity could be interpreted as 
just a delay in the possible onset of a cyclical downturn, along the lines of the 
“Recession” alternative scenario in th e Greenbook.  Although the recent sharp 
increases in energy prices may well add to  inflationary pressures in the short run, 
they are also likely to weigh on house hold and business spending.  In such 
circumstances, the Committee might think th at there will be sufficient resource 
slack to contain inflation pressures, even with  a slight further easing of policy.    
(30) The discussion of recent developments and the outlook for economic 
activity and inflation in the draft statement accompanying Alternative A is not much changed from the April FOMC statement.  The apparent strength in consumer spending in the second quart er is acknowledged, but the language 
describing the outlook remains quite do wnbeat.  In the first sentence of the 
inflation paragraph, the reference to core  inflation having “improved” is updated 
to describe recent readings as “stable,” co nsistent with the incoming core inflation 
data.  The phrases in that sentence are re ordered to emphasize the point that core 
inflation has been stable.  Alternative A gi ves no explicit assessment of the risks to 
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)
36 of 41
   
either growth or inflation, but simply repeats the risk assessment paragraph from 
the previous statement, pointing to liquidity  measures and the cumulative easing of 
policy as providing support to growth. 
(31) With investors expecting the funds rate to be increased this year, the 
adoption of Alternative A would surpri se financial markets.  Short- and 
intermediate-term interest rates would fall, but long-term nominal Treasury yields 
and measures of inflation compensation would probably increase, as investors 
came to perceive the Committee as willin g to tolerate a higher trajectory of 
inflation than had been thought.  Equity pr ices might rise, while it is likely that the 
foreign exchange value of th e dollar would depreciate.   
Money and Debt Forecasts 
(32) M2 is projected to expand at about a 7¾ percent annual pace in the first 
half of 2008 ―faster than nominal GDP ―as a result of the lagged effects of falling 
opportunity costs and heightened demand for safe and liquid assets.  Under the 
Greenbook forecast, M2 growth is expected to  slow to a 3½ percent annual rate in 
the second half, as opportunity costs start to rise and the continued gradual improvement in financial market conditions leads the shift to safe and liquid assets 
to unwind.  For the year as a whole, M2 is  projected to expand about 5¾ percent.  
In 2009, M2 is expected to advance a bout 4 percent, slower than nominal GDP, 
largely reflecting the further increase in the opportunity cost of holding M2 assets 
as short-term interest rates rise. (33) Growth of domestic nonfinancial sector debt is expected to slow to an 
annual rate of around 4¾ percent in 2008 and 4½ percent in 2009, down notably 
from the 8¼ percent advance posted last ye ar.  The fall-off in debt growth owes 
mainly to an anticipated slowing of household borrowing, amid falling house prices and tighter standards and terms on consumer loans, and also to diminishing

Appendix A: Measures of the  Equilibrium Real Rate 
 
  
   
  
   
Measure Description 
Single-equation 
Model  The measure of the equilibrium real rate in the single-equation model is based on an 
estimated aggregate-demand relationship between  the current value of the output gap and 
its lagged values as well as the lagged va lues of the real federal funds rate. 
Small Structural 
Model  The small-scale model of the economy consists  of equations for six variables: the output 
gap, the equity premium, the federal budget surp lus, the trend growth rate of output, the 
real bond yield, and the real federal funds rate. 
Large Model 
(FRB/US) Estimates of the equilibrium real rate using FRB/US—the staff’s large-scale econometric 
model of the U.S. economy—depend on a very broad array of economic factors, some of 
which take the form of projected valu es of the model’s exogenous variables. 
Greenbook-
consistent  The FRB/US model is used in conjunction with an extended version of the Greenbook 
forecast to derive a Greenbook-consistent measure .  FRB/US is first add-factored so that 
its simulation matches the extended Greenbook forecast, and then a second simulation is 
run off this baseline to determine the value of the real federal funds rate that closes the 
output gap. 
TIPS-based 
Factor Model Yields on TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) reflect investors’ expectations of the future path of real interest rates, but also include term and liquidity premiums.  The 
TIPS-based measure of the equilibrium real ra te is constructed using the seven-year-ahead 
instantaneous real forward rate derived fro m TIPS yields as of the Bluebook publication 
date.  This forward rate is adjusted to remove estimates of the term and liquidity 
premiums based on a three-factor arbitrage -free term-structure model applied to TIPS 
yields, nominal yields, and inflation.  Because TIPS indexation is based on the total CPI, this measure is also adjusted for the me dium-term difference—projected at 40 basis 
points—between total CPI inflation and core PCE inflation. The equilibrium real rate—that is, th e nominal rate adjusted for expected inflation—is the real federal 
funds rate that, if maintained, would be projected to  return output to its po tential level over time.   
The short-run equilibrium rate is de fined as the rate that would clos e the output gap in twelve quarters 
given the corresponding model’s pr ojection of the economy.  The medi um-run concept is the value of 
the real federal funds rate projecte d to keep output at potential in se ven years, under the assumption that 
monetary policy acts to bring actual  and potential output into  line in the short run and then keeps them 
equal thereafter.  Both concepts of  the equilibrium real rate approxima te expected inflation using trailing 
four-quarter core PCE inflation.  The TIPS-based factor model measur e provides an estimate of market 
expectations for the real federal funds rate seven years ahead.  
In calculating the actu al real funds rate, the nominal rate is measured as the quarterly average of  
the observed federal funds rate.  Expected inflation is approximated in three ways: using lagged core 
inflation, as was done to define the equilibrium real rate; using lagged four-quarter headline PCE 
inflation; and using projected f our-quarter headline PCE inflati on beginning with the next quarter. 
For the current quarter, the nominal rate is specifie d as the target federal f unds rate on the Bluebook 
publication date.  Moreover, if th e upcoming FOMC meeting falls ea rly in the quarter, the lagged 
inflation measure ends in the last qu arter and the projected inflation measure starts in the current quarter. 
Confidence intervals reflect uncertainties about model specification, coefficients, and the level of 
potential output.  The final column of the table in dicates the values published in the previous Bluebook.

inflation objective.  The outcome-based and forecast -based rules were estimated using real-time data 
over the sample 1988:1-2006:4; each specification was chosen using th e Bayesian information criterion. 
Each rule incorporates a 75 basi s point shift in the intercept,  specified as a sequence of  
25 basis point increments during the first three quarters of 1998.  The first two simple rules were 
proposed by Taylor (1993, 1999).  The prescriptions  of the first-difference rule do not depend on 
assumptions regarding r*  or the level of the outpu t gap; see Orphanides (2003).

FRB/US Model Simulations :  Prescriptions from the two empiri cal rules are computed using dynamic 
simulations of the FRB/US model, implemented as though the rule were followed starting at this FOMC 
meeting.  The dotted line labeled “Previous Bluebook” is  based on the current specification of the policy 
rule, applied to the previous Gr eenbook projection.  Confidence intervals are based on stochastic 
simulations of the FRB/US model with shocks drawn from the estimated residuals over 1986-2005.  
Information from Financial Markets :  The expected funds rate path is based on forward rate 
agreements, and the confidence intervals for this path are constructed using prices of interest rate caps. 
Near-Term Prescriptions of Simple Policy Rules :  These prescriptions are calculated using Greenbook 
projections for inflation and the output gap. Because the first-difference rule involves the lagged funds 
rate, the value labeled “Previous Bluebook” for the curr ent quarter is computed using the actual value  
of the lagged funds rate, and the one -quarter-ahead prescriptions are ba sed on this rule’s prescription for 
the current quarter.
