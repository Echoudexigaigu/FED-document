MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES  
Recent Developments 
Summary 
(1)   Financial markets came under extraordinary stress over the intermeeting 
period.  Markets were roiled by the bankru ptcy of Lehman Brothers (which occurred 
just before the September FOMC meeting), the difficulties at AIG, the closing of 
Washington Mutual, and the forced sale of Wachovia.  Those events intensified 
already heightened concerns about the condition of other U.S. financial institutions 
and about the impact of financial devel opments on the broader economy.  Against 
this backdrop, investors pulled back furt her from risk taking; as a consequence, 
funding markets for terms beyond overnight essentially ceased to function for a time 
and still remain severely impaired, yields  and spreads on money market instruments 
and corporate bonds shot up, secondary marke t prices for leveraged syndicated loans 
plunged, and equity prices registered steep  declines amid extremel y high volatility.  
Financial markets abroad experienced similar swings.   
(2) In response, the Federal Reserve, the Department of the Treasury, the 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Securities and Exchange 
Commission, and many foreign central banks and governments took an 
unprecedented series of policy initiatives ov er the intermeeting period.  Sentiment in 
credit markets seemed to improve somewh at late in the period, and there was a 
modest recovery in liquidity in bank funding markets after the U.S. and foreign governments announced they would inject capital into their banking systems and 
guarantee selected liabilities of banking organizations in their jurisdictions.  However, 
markets generally remain extremely illiquid and volatile, and investors are still quite 
skittish.   
   
(3) On net over the intermeeting period, market participants marked down 
substantially the expected path of monetary policy, with some of the decline occurring 
after the intermeeting cut in the target federal funds rate on October 8, and they now 
foresee an additional rate cut at the Oct ober 28-29 meeting.  Short-term nominal 
Treasury yields fell amid heavy flight-to-qua lity flows, while longer-term yields rose, 
reportedly in response to expectations of  increased Treasury issuance to finance 
various government initiatives.  Issuance of corporate debt slowed further amid the 
unfavorable market conditions, and nonfinancial businesses drew heavily on existing 
lines of credit at banks.  The dollar appr eciated against all major foreign currencies 
except the yen.   
Financial Institutions 
(4) Investor sentiment deteriorated early in the intermeeting period in reaction 
to the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers and the rapid deterioration in the financial 
condition of AIG.1  These developments precipitated losses at other financial entities, 
including prime money market mutual funds (MMMFs).  Prominently, one of these— 
the Reserve Primary Fund—“broke the buck” on September 16, triggering rapid and 
widespread outflows from other prime MMMFs and inflows into those holding 
predominantly Treasury securities (Chart 1).  Prime funds responded to the surge in redemptions by reducing their purchases of commercial paper and other short-term 
assets, causing significant st rains in these markets.  Meanwhile short-term Treasury 
bill yields plummeted amid sharp inflow s into Treasury-only MMMFs.  Intense 
                                           
1 On September 16, the Federal Reserve announced the establishment of a liquidity facility 
that would provide up to $85 b illion in credit to assist AIG in  meeting its obligations as they 
come due.  This facility has a 24-month term , with interest accruing on the outstanding 
balance at a rate of three-month Libor plus 850  basis points, and is collateralized by all the 
assets of AIG and of its primary non-regulate d subsidiaries.  On October 8, the Federal 
Reserve announced an additional  program under which it will le nd up to $37.8 billion to 
finance investment-grade, fixed-income securities  held by AIG.  These securities had been 
previously lent by AIG’s insurance company subsidiaries to third parties.

demands among investors to hold Treasury  securities and increased counterparty 
concerns reportedly led to a substantial sc aling back of activity among traditional 
securities lenders in the Treasury market, c ontributing to strains in the Treasury repo 
and cash markets that were evidenced by a very high volume of fails-to-deliver.  
Redemptions from prime MMMFs slowed afte r the Treasury established a temporary 
guarantee program for balances held in MMMFs and the Federal Reserve announced 
its Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Lending Facility 
(AMLF) on September 19, although outflows continued until early October.2  Use of 
the AMLF to finance purchases of asset- backed commercial paper (ABCP) ramped 
up quickly to about $150 bil lion by early October but has diminished substantially of 
late.  Further, to support a private-sector initiative designed to provide liquidity to 
MMMFs, on October 21 the Federal Reserve announced the creation of the Money 
Market Investor Funding Facility (MMIFF).3 
(5) Difficulties also intensified at a number of depository institutions.  The 
FDIC’s decision to resolve the failure of  Washington Mutual (WaMu) on September 
25 in a manner that imposed significant losses on senior and subordinated debt 
holders led investors to mark down their expectations of gove rnment support for 
unsecured non-deposit liabilities, underminin g the ability of some other banking 
organizations—including Wachovia, at the time  the fourth-largest U.S. bank by assets 
—to obtain funding.  On September 29, to avoid serious adverse effects on economic 
                                           
2 Under the AMLF, the Federal Reserve extend s non-recourse loans at the primary credit 
rate to U.S. depository institut ions and bank holding companies to finance their purchases of 
high-quality ABCP from money market mutual funds, thereby assisting money funds that 
hold such paper in meeting demand for redemptions from investors. 
3 Under the MMIFF, the Federal Re serve will provide senior secured funding to a series of 
special purpose vehicles to finance their purchase of certain money market instruments from eligible investors.  Eligible assets will include certificates of deposit, commercial paper, and 
bank notes issued by highly rate d financial institutions with re maining maturities of 90 days 
or less.  Eligible investors will include U. S. MMMFs and over time may include other U.S. 
money market investors.

conditions and financial stability, th e Secretary of the Treasury, on the 
recommendation of the FDIC and the Federa l Reserve and in cons ultation with the 
President, invoked the systemic risk excep tion to facilitate the sale of Wachovia’s 
banking operations to Citigroup.  Under this arrangement, the FDIC committed to 
absorb losses beyond a certain level on a portion of Wachovia’s lo ans.  However, this 
agreement was subsequently voided when We lls Fargo and Wachovia signed a merger 
agreement in a transaction that required no financial assistance from the FDIC.     
(6) Other financial institutions experienced heightened stress during the 
intermeeting period, most notably Morgan Stanley and several major hedge funds.  
Morgan Stanley was buffeted by uncertainty  about whether Mitsubishi UFJ Financial 
Group would close its $9 billion purchase of a 21 percent interest in the firm, a 
transaction that was finally confirmed on October 13.  More recently, investor 
concerns about hedge funds intensified after news surfaced of poor performance at Citadel and after Highland Capital Manage ment announced that it was closing two 
funds that had experienced asset value declin es in excess of 30 percent this year.    
(7) The equity prices of banks and insura nce companies were extremely volatile 
and posted steep declines on net over the intermeeting period, in part reflecting a 
marked deterioration in the outlook for pr ofits.  CDS spreads of Goldman Sachs and 
Morgan Stanley soared in the wake of Le hman Brothers’ collapse.  Those spreads 
narrowed sharply after the two firms converted their nonblank depository institutions into commercial banks and were granted ba nk holding company status by the Federal 
Reserve and following news of capital investments by Berkshire Hathaway and 
Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group in Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, respectively.  
CDS spreads for commercial banks were also  volatile but moved down substantially 
in response to news of the Treasury’s Capital Purchase Program and the FDIC’s 
guarantee of selected bank liabilities, endi ng the intermeeting period about 85 basis 
points lower.  Meanwhile, short-term agency  debt spreads widened to well above pre-
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)

conservatorship levels, reportedly because in vestors perceived the guarantee of agency 
debt to be weaker than the FDIC’s guaran tee of senior unsecured bank debt.  In 
addition, some market participants registered  concerns that the credit quality of the 
GSEs could be impaired if they were requ ired to purchase large volumes of subprime 
mortgage assets.  CDS spreads for insurance companies also surged over the 
intermeeting period. 
Market Functioning 
(8) Short-term funding markets came under considerable stress amid 
heightened concerns about counterparty credit risk.  Conditions in unsecured 
interbank funding markets worsened, with sp reads of Libor over comparable-maturity 
overnight index swap (OIS) ra tes rising to unprecedented le vels and with very little 
trading taking place at terms beyond overni ght (Chart 2).  Strains increased even in 
overnight funding markets, as overnight Li bor rose to about 340 basis points above 
the federal funds rate target in early Oc tober and overnight federal funds traded 
within an unusually wide range, partly reflec ting tiering across institutions.  Conditions 
in very short-term funding markets improved  significantly after the European Central 
Bank (ECB), the Bank of England (BoE ), and the Swiss National Bank (SNB) 
initiated a series of unlimited fixed-rate dollar auctions, and governments in a number 
of countries, including the United States, announced plans to inject capital into 
banking institutions and to guarantee some bank liabilities.  Li bor fixings declined 
about 415, 230, and 100 basis points for overnight, one-week, and one-month 
maturities, respectively, starting on October 9.  Conditions in markets for unsecured 
funding for longer terms also improved, but trading reportedly remains very sparse.   (9) Conditions in secured funding markets were also quite poor.  The overnight 
general collateral repo rate and short-dated Treasury bill yields traded near zero for 
most of the period amid heavy demand for safe investments.  Those low rates

occurred despite issuance by the Treasury of  over $500 billion in new bills under the 
Supplementary Financing Program (SFP).  Overnight lending of securities from the 
System Open Market Account (SOMA) portfo lio and fails-to-deliver soared to record 
highs.  To address strains in  the Treasury market, the Federal Reserve introduced 
temporary changes in its securities lending program, including a reduction in the fee 
structure and an increase in per-dealer borrowing limits.  In addition, the Treasury increased its issuance by reopening severa l notes that were experiencing severe 
demand imbalances in the market.  Thes e measures, however, had only a modest 
effect on Treasury market trading conditions.  Heightened strains were also evident in 
the markets for repo transactions backed by collateral other than Treasury securities.  
Rates on agency mortgage-backed security (M BS) repos were especially volatile, and 
haircuts applied to a wide range of repo co llateral reportedly increased over the past 
few weeks from already elevated levels.  Trading in these non-Treasury repo markets 
remained essentially confined to overnight maturities.   (10) Conditions in the commercial paper (CP) market continued to be strained, 
as net redemptions of shares in prime MMMFs and concerns among money managers 
about credit quality and liquidity cut into the demand for CP, making issuance 
difficult.  As a result, spreads of ABCP and lower-rated CP rates to the target federal 
funds rate widened sharply, and amounts outs tanding in the financial sector continued 
to trend down.  In response to these de velopments, the Federal Reserve announced 
the establishment of the AMLF, the Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF), and the MMIFF.
4  Reportedly, some improvements in  CP market functioning started to 
                                           
4 On October 7, the Federal Reserve authoriz ed the creation of the CPFF to provide a 
liquidity backstop to U.S. issuers of commerc ial paper through a special purpose vehicle 
(SPV) that will purchase three-month unsecure d and asset-backed CP fr om eligible issuers 
through the primary dealers.  The Federal Re serve will provide overnight financing to the 
SPV under the CPFF at the target federal funds rate and will be secured by all of the assets 
of the SPV.  The Federal Reserve will also be  secured by any excess spread and fees that

surface in recent days, perhaps because in vestors gained comfort from the FDIC 
guarantee of some CP issued by bank ing organizations and also from the 
announcement of details of the CPFF, which will become operational on October 27.   
(11) The functioning of the CDS market remained far from normal.  Judging 
from the wide range and declining frequenc y of dealer quotes, both liquidity and price 
discovery was impaired over recent weeks, especially for contracts involving financial 
firms.  The bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers created another significant credit event in 
the CDS market and added to stress generated by the placement of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac into conservatorship.  None theless, auctions held  to determine the 
settlement prices for CDS contracts wr itten on the two GSEs and on Lehman 
Brothers, which were conducted on Octobe r 6 and October 10, respectively, were 
successful in facilitating the settlement of a significant number of credit derivative 
trades on these institutions.  The functioni ng of longer-term corporate debt markets 
also deteriorated over the intermeeting period.  Staff estimates of bid-asked spreads in the bond market rose sharply, and in the secondary market for leveraged syndicated 
loans, the average bid-asked spread surged nearly 200 basis points to an unprecedented level of 373 basis points in mid-October. (12) Depository institutions’ use of the pri mary credit facility was elevated over 
the intermeeting period, with primary credit outstanding totaling $108 billion as of 
October 22.  The 28-day Term Auction Fa cility (TAF) auction held on September 22 
was heavily bid, with a stop-out rate of 3. 75 percent, more than 50 basis points above 
one-month Libor.  The first 84-day TAF auction that offered $150 billion was 
announced and conducted on October 6; the auction was undersubscribed and 
stopped out at the minimum bid rate of 1.39  percent, perhaps because banks did not 
have sufficient time to post additional co llateral ahead of the auction.  The 28-day 
                                                                                                                                        
accumulate in the SPV.  Additional details  regarding the CPFF we re provided on October

TAF auction held on October 20, however, also was not fully subscribed and stopped 
out at the minimum bid rate.5  The ten Term Securities Lending Facility (TSLF) 
auctions conducted over the intermeeting period—three for Schedule 1 and seven for 
Schedule 2 collateral—saw very high demand and stop-out rates that were well above 
the corresponding minimum fee rates.  Deal ers mentioned challenging repo market 
conditions and elevated spreads in collatera lized markets as possible explanations for 
the strong participation.  On September 24,  dealers exercised about $47 billion of the 
nearly $50 billion of TOP options for TSLF loans spa nning the September quarter-
end.  The use of the Primary Dealer Credit  Facility (PDCF) also surged over the 
intermeeting period, and PDCF outstandin gs were $102 billion as of October 22—
nearly three times the level observed in March and April in the wake of the Bear 
Stearns collapse.  As of October 22, cred it extensions under the AMLF totaled $108 
billion, but little new net credit has b een extended since October 1.  Credit 
outstanding to AIG stands at about $90 billion.  All told, the sharp increase in 
liquidity provision had a marked impact on  the size and the composition of the 
Federal Reserve balance sheet.   (13) Beginning with the reserve maintenan ce periods starting October 9, the 
Federal Reserve has paid interest on re quired reserve and excess balances.  
Nevertheless, partly because of the extremel y high provision of liquidity through the 
Federal Reserve’s liquidity facilities, the e ffective federal funds rate has been well 
below the FOMC’s target, with a substant ial amount of trading at rates below the 
                                           
5 On October 6, the Federal Reserve boosted th e sizes of both the 28-day and 84-day TAF 
auctions to $150 billion each.  These increases will eventually bring the maximum amount 
outstanding under the regular TAF program to $600 billion.  In addition , the sizes of the two 
forward TAF auctions—announced on Septembe r 29 and scheduled to be conducted in 
November to extend credit over year-end—were  increased to $150 billion each, so that a 
maximum of $900 billion of TAF credit will potentially be outstanding over year-end.

interest rate paid on excess balances.6  However, federal funds futures rates rose 
following the announcement on October 22 that the Federal Reserve had increased 
the rate it would pay on excess bala nces beginning the following day.7 (See the box 
“Early Experience with Interest on Reserves.”)  
Monetary Policy Expectations and Treasury Yields 
(14) The intensification of the financial tu rmoil, the further impairment of the 
functioning of funding markets, and a much weaker economic outlook led investors 
to revise down their expected path for the federal funds rate in the near term and to 
place considerable odds on at least a 25 basis point rate cut at the October 28-29 
FOMC meeting  (Chart 3).  The FOMC’s d ecision to leave its policy rate unchanged 
at 2 percent at the September meeting took some market participants by surprise and 
led them to scale back their expectations of policy easing over the next year.  However, policy expectations shifted do wn in response to the 50 basis point 
intermeeting cut by the FOMC in coordina tion with other foreign central banks on 
October 8, as market participants were reportedly somewhat surprised by the decision 
and interpreted the language of the accompanying statement as suggesting that further 
easing was likely.  The reaction to bot h policy actions was soon overshadowed, 
however, by market concerns about the fina ncial sector and the economic outlook.   
(15) Options on federal funds futures sugges t that investors currently place high 
odds on the FOMC lowering the federal fu nds target at the October 28-29 meeting, 
                                           
6 The effective federal funds rate averaged 1. 28 percent over the intermeeting period.  The 
intraday standard deviation of the funds ra te, at about 75 basis points, was extremely 
elevated by historical standards and more than  double the level observed in March.  Over 
this intermeeting period, the volume of long -term repurchase agreements declined $10 
billion, and on September 18 the Desk redeemed  the full amount of maturing Treasury bill 
holdings, $3.3 billion, to draw re serve from the banking system.    
7 Previously the rate on excess balances had been  set at the lowest federal funds rate target 
established by the FOMC during the reserve maintenance period minus 75 basis points.  
Under the revised rule the rate will be set to the lowest target rate minus 35 basis points.

Early Experience with Interest on Reserves 
 
The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act accelerated the Federal Reserve’s 
authority to pay interest on balances held by or on behalf of depository institutions at 
Reserve Banks.  This interest began accruing  on October 9.  The payment of interest 
on excess balances should reduce depository institutions’ incentives to sell federal 
funds at rates below the rate paid on excess.  To date, the results of this policy change 
have been mixed, although some evidence suggests that interest on reserves might 
become a more effective tool over time. 
 
 
The rate paid on excess balances has not esta blished a hard floor to the federal funds 
rate.  In
itially, this rate was set equal to th e lowest targeted fede ral funds rate for the 
maintenance period less 75 basis points, resulting in a rate of 75 basis points.  From 
October 9 to October 22, an average of 35 percent of brokered federal funds trades transacted at rates below 75 basis points.  However, the share of brokered trades at 
rates near zero has declined substantially.  Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, two large net 
sellers of funds in the market, are not eligible to receive interest on the balances they hold and are reportedly selling funds at rates below 75 basis points.  In addition, some 
small depository institutions have also be en selling funds at rates below 75 basis 
points.  Some of these institutions may be lieve that their correspondent banks will not 
pass on interest earned on excess balances and thus are willing to sell federal funds at 
rates below the rate paid on ex cess balances.  To foster trad ing at rates closer to the 
target rate, the Board narrowed the spread between the target federal funds rate and 
the rate paid on excess balances to 35 basis points effective October 23.  
 
Market par
ticipants may still be adapting to  the new system.  In principle, arbitrage 
should keep market rates close to the ra te paid on excess balances if enough 
institutions that are eligible to receive interest were to bid for the funds of ineligible 
institutions.  Indeed, a couple of large bank s are apparently doing so now and in some 
volume, and this pattern may strengthen over time.  In addition, correspondent 
banking agreements may be restructured in  light of the payment of interest to 
respondent banks.  Some respondent in stitutions are reportedly considering 
terminating their correspondent relationships and holding balances directly with the 
Reserve Banks.  
 
One potentially related development is a sign ificant decline in the volume of brokered 
transactions in the federal funds market.  With the extraordinary level of balances in 
the system, and the ability to earn significant interest on an essentially risk-free asset, the incentive for institutions to trade in  the overnight market may have diminished.

assigning odds of roughly 25, 40, and 20 per cent, respectively to a 25, 50, and 75 basis 
point rate cut, and about 10 percent odds to no change in the policy rate.  However, 
these probabilities may be distorted to some extent by expectations that the effective 
funds rate will continue to tr ade below the target for a whil e.  Responses to the Desk’s 
primary dealer survey on October 20—whic h were not affected by this factor 
although they may now be somewhat stale— indicate that dealers place 38 percent 
probabilities on a 25 and 50 basis point rate cut, a 3 percent probability on a 75 basis 
point rate cut, and a 20 percent probability on no change.  Further ahead, futures 
quotes suggest that investors expect the FOMC  to begin tightening by the spring of 
2009, with the federal funds rate returning to  a level of about 1.5 percent by the end 
of 2009 and 2.75 percent by the end of 2010 .  However, these estimates may also be 
distorted; term premiums resulting from  heightened market volatility and poor 
functioning in other financial markets may be substantially higher than currently 
assumed by the staff, which would imply a lo wer long-term trajectory for the expected 
funds rate.  Uncertainty about the federal funds rate six months ahead increased over 
the intermeeting period, as indicated by  the widening of the option-implied 
probability distribution at this horizon.     
(16) Two-year nominal Treasury yields declined 36 basis points on net over the 
intermeeting period amid heavy safe-haven demand and in response to the downward 
shift in policy expectations and the economic  outlook.  In contrast, ten-year nominal 
yields rose 50 basis points, likely reflecting expectatio ns for increased Treasury 
issuance to finance federal government a sset purchases and other activities, and 
perhaps also increased uncertainty about the future course of interest rates, which may have boosted term premiums.  Standard meas ures of inflation compensation based on 
differences between nominal and inflation- indexed Treasury yields were extremely 
volatile over the intermeeting period.  On net, inflation compensation over the next 
five years fell about 147 basis points, while it rose 41 basis points five to ten years

ahead.  Inferences about inflation expect ations from these figures should be made 
cautiously, however, as market yields were lik ely heavily affected by large increases in 
liquidity premiums in TIPS yields and by supply effects on nominal Treasury yields.  
Measures of inflation compensation obtai ned from inflation swaps, by contrast, 
posted modest declines across the term structure and appeared more consistent with 
the mixed changes in inflation expectations  in the Reuters/Michigan survey and the 
roughly $25 per barrel decrease in the price of crude oil over the intermeeting period.  
In addition, respondents to the Desk’s surv ey expect a lower rate of CPI inflation 
from five to ten years ahead. 
Capital Markets 
(17) As the financial turmoil intensified and the economic outlook deteriorated 
over the intermeeting period, broad equity  price indexes dropped substantially on net 
amid very high volatility (Chart 4).  St ock price declines were widespread across 
sectors.  Financial firms notably underperfo rmed for most of the period, although 
they recently moved back more closely in lin e with broad indexes.  With the earnings 
reporting season just getting under way, anal ysts currently expect earnings per share 
for the S&P 500 to be about 3 percent lower than year-ago levels, pulled down mostly 
by decreases at financial firms.  For the roug hly 75 percent of publicly traded banking 
organizations that have reported earnings  to date (excluding three financial 
institutions that will be acquired in the near term—Merrill Lynch, Wachovia, and 
Sovereign), third-quarter earnings were slig htly negative.  Weak third-quarter results 
were attributed to write-downs on secu rity holdings and to continued loan loss 
provisioning to offset increased credit losses on a variety of loans.  In contrast, 
earnings at nonfinancial firms are expected  to come in about 12 percent above year-
ago levels, with gains largely accounted for by the oil and gas sectors.  Looking ahead, 
analysts marked down their projections for ea rnings over the coming year significantly

for both financial and nonfinancial firms.  Option-implied volatility on the S&P 500 
surged to a record level, well above its pr evious high in 1998, and the spread between 
the twelve-month forward trend earnings-pri ce ratio for S&P 500 firms and the real 
long-term Treasury yield—a rough gauge of  the equity premium—reached the highest 
level since the start of  the series in 1982. 
(18) Conditions in corporate debt markets tightened further over the 
intermeeting period.  Risk spreads on inve stment- and speculative-grade bonds soared 
to historically high levels.  The increase s appeared to reflect upward revisions to 
expected losses as well as a further widening of already elevated risk premiums.  Gross 
bond issuance by investment-grade nonfin ancial firms has been moderate, and 
issuance of speculative-grade bonds has been  nil.  Conditions in the leveraged 
syndicated loan market also deteriorated sh arply over the period.  In particular, the 
secondary market average bid price plunged an  unprecedented 15 points, to nearly 70, 
reportedly due to heavy sales by hedge fund s and unwinds of total return swaps and 
market-value collateralized loan obligations.  The implied spread on an index of loan 
credit default swaps (the LCDX) almost doubled, on net, to about 800 basis points 
over the period.  Finally, hedge fund performance continued to deteriorate over the past few weeks, with the Global Hedge Fund Index tumbling more than 10 percent.  
(19) The interest rate on 30-year fixed-rate  conforming mortgages increased, on 
net, about 50 basis points to almost 6.5 per cent in mid-October.   The mortgage rate 
had nearly returned to the very elevated levels seen just before Fannie Mae and 
Freddie Mac were taken into conservatorshi p in early September, but has reversed 
most of that rise over the past week.  MBS spreads were extremely volatile amid 
reportedly poor trading conditions.  Mean while, interest rates on nonconforming 
jumbo mortgages remained extremely hi gh.  Delinquency rates for prime and 
subprime mortgages increased further.  Issuance of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac MBS in September increased slightly but re mained below the pace seen in the first

half of the year, while issuance by Ginni e Mae has stayed elevated; the Federal 
Reserve purchased $14.5 billion in agency  discount notes over the intermeeting 
period.  Issuance of asset-backed securities  (ABS) collateralized by consumer credit 
declined notably in the third quarter, at leas t partly as a result of historically high 
spreads.  
(20) Conditions in the municipal bond market deteriorated substantially in recent 
weeks, although there appears to have been some improvement recently.  Variable-
rate demand notes and tender option bonds reportedly were put back to liquidity 
providers, who in turn sold the underlying  long-term bonds in the secondary market, 
putting pressure on prices and market functioning.  Amid the resulting unfavorable 
climate, issuance of longer-term municipa l bonds slowed markedly in September and 
early October.  The credit quality of muni cipal bonds also deteriorated in the third 
quarter, and the number of downgrades far outpaced the number of upgrades.  Yield ratios on municipal bonds spiked to record  levels, although the short-term ratio 
retraced somewhat in the last  few days of the period.   
Foreign Developments 
(21) The unfolding financial crisis affect ed financial markets across the globe 
over the intermeeting period, intensifying in  Europe and spreading to markets in the 
emerging market economies as we ll.  Spreads over OIS rates of term sterling and term 
euro rates rose sharply from their already elevated levels follo wing the collapse of 
Lehman Brothers and difficulties at AIG, although the increase was less pronounced 
than in comparable dollar markets.  To a ddress the growing global strain in dollar 
funding markets, the Federal Reserve progressive ly increased the sizes of its reciprocal 
currency swap lines with foreign central banks and boosted the number of central 
bank counterparties (Australia, Japan, Canada, United Kingdom, Sweden, Norway, 
and Denmark were added).  Late in the period, in connection with these swap 
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)
18 of 45
   
arrangements, the European Central Bank, the Bank of England, the Swiss National 
Bank, and the Bank of Japan began to conduct auctions of dollar liquidity with 7-day, 
28-day, and 84-day maturities at pre-annou nced fixed interest rates, with funding 
being made available to fully meet the quantities demanded by borrowers in 
possession of eligible collateral.  Additi onally, the Swiss National Bank announced 
plans to draw on its swap line to help finance up to $60 billion in  purchases of assets 
from a major Swiss bank.  
(22) In early October, amid declines in c onfidence and increasingly constricted 
access to funding, several high-profile banks in Europe were on th e verge of failure, 
prompting nationalizations and capital injections by their respective governments.  A 
pullback from risk in virtually all ad vanced and emerging market economies had 
induced plunges in stock prices, sharp swings in exchange ra tes, large increases in risk 
spreads, and an almost complete seizing-up of  credit markets (Chart 5).  Subsequently, 
authorities in many foreign industrial coun tries, as well as in the United States, 
announced a series of measures of unpreced ented scale and scope designed to support 
the banking system and restore the functioning of credit markets.  Since these announcements, conditions in short-term fu nding markets, as evidenced by Libor to 
OIS spreads, have improved somewhat.  Equi ty prices initially moved up in most 
markets, but they continued to swing wildly  thereafter as investors focused on the 
risks of global recession.  On net, over th e intermeeting period, equity indexes in most 
advanced and developing countries declined 20 percent or more.  Interest rates on sovereign bonds in industrial countries exhi bited substantial volatility, and nominal 
yield curves steepened as two-year yields declined while ten-year yields were mixed.  
In developing countries, sovereign credit spreads rose sharply, leading several 
countries to postpone scheduled sales of debt.    (23) The major currencies index of the do llar rose sharply over the period, 
increasing 9 percent on net, as the dollar ap peared to benefit from the global decrease

in risk appetite.  An exception was the do llar’s 7 percent depreciation versus the yen, 
which apparently reflected a rapid unwindin g of yen carry-trade positions.  Implied 
volatilities in most currency pairs rose to multi-year highs, making hedging currency 
risk far more costly.  The dollar appreciat ed 9 percent against the currencies of our 
other important trading partners over the pe riod.  Most notably, the dollar rose about 
25 percent against the Brazilian real and the Mexican peso, and 21 percent versus the 
Korean won, despite reports of heavy intervention sales of dollars by the monetary authorities of these countries.  The dollar’s especially sharp increase against the 
currencies of emerging market economies likely  reflected investors’ pulling back from 
risk, although in some cases sharp declines in commodity prices likely also contributed 
to the weakening of those currencies. 
Debt and Money 
(24) The debt of domestic nonfinancial sector s is projected to have expanded at 
a 9 percent annual rate in the third quarter, al most twice as fast as the average pace in 
the first half of the year and 5 percentage points greater than the pace reported in the 
previous Bluebook (Chart 6).  The pickup was attributable almost entirely to increased 
borrowing by the federal government rela ted to the Supplemental Financing Program 
and the TARP.  In contrast, the rate of debt growth in the business and household sectors is estimated to have slowed.  As already noted, in the nonfinancial business 
sector, investment-grade bond issuance wa s moderate and speculative-grade bond 
issuance was nil, perhaps due to extremely hi gh interest rates and risk spreads.  By 
contrast, commercial paper outstanding rose despite the extremely impaired market conditions.  In the leveraged loan market, institutional issuance reportedly continued to be very weak.  Household debt continue d to slow as falling house prices weighed 
on mortgage borrowing and the weakness in consumption spending trimmed consumer credit growth.

(25) Commercial bank credit surged in mid- September, boosted by increases in 
“other loans,” banks’ holdings of securi ties, and commercial and industrial (C&I) 
loans.  The “other loans” category saw a ma rked increase in unplanned overdrafts by 
a wide range of customers, including money fund complexes, as well as draws on lines 
of credit by financial firms, consistent with the stress in  funding markets.  Commercial 
banks’ acquisition of a large volume of no n-agency and non-Treasury securities likely 
reflected in part purchases of CP stimulated  by the AMLF program.  The increase in 
C&I loans was reportedly due mostly to draw  downs on pre-existing lines of credit; 
however, some respondents to the Senior Lo an Officer Opinion Survey indicated that 
they had also increased loans not made un der previous commitment.  Very large 
fractions of the surveyed banks reported having tightened terms and standards on a 
broad range of loan types for both businesses and households.       (26)  M2 expanded at a rapid 15½ percent annual rate in September and is 
estimated to have accelerated further to a 17 percent pace in October.  Liquid deposits surged in September reflecting, in pa rt, robust expansions in the deposits of 
broker-dealers, trusts, and corporate customers at a few large banks.  Small time deposits increased sharply in September and are set to post dramatic gains in October, 
as banks and thrifts reportedly continued to bid aggressively for these deposits.  By 
contrast, liquid deposits slowed almost to a halt this month.  Retail money funds were 
about flat in September but appear to be expanding briskly in October.  Currency growth picked up in September and has rise n further in October, apparently reflecting 
increased domestic and foreign demand.  Overall, money growth may be being boosted by some reallocation of household a ssets toward safer instruments; stock and 
bond mutual funds, for example, have regist ered substantial runoffs over recent 
weeks.

Economic Outlook 
(27) The staff has marked down sharply its outlook for economic growth in the 
second half of 2008 and in 2009.  Consumer outlays, housing starts, and business 
investment in equipment and structures all have been weaker than we projected in September.  Moreover, financial turmoil ha s intensified, and ba nks further tightened 
credit terms and standards for households and businesses in the third quarter.  As a consequence, the forecast now assumes that the Committee will lower the target federal funds rate 50 basis points at this meeting, 25 basis poi nts at the December 
meeting, and another 25 basis points at the January meeting.  The target funds rate is 
assumed to remain at ½ percent through mi d-2010 and then begin a gradual ascent.  
Long-term Treasury yields are projected to be  flat over the next two years.  Although 
yields would tend to rise over time as the maturity window moves through the period 
of low short-term rates prevai ling over the next few years, we  assume that this effect 
will be offset as market participants revise down their policy expectations toward the path incorporated in our baseline forecast.  Fixed mortgage rates and corporate bond yields are projected to decline as econom ic conditions gradually improve and the 
extreme aversion to risk-taking recedes.  Stock prices rise at a 12 percent annual rate 
in 2009 and 2010 from a starting point that  is 23 percent lower than in the previous 
forecast; this path implies that the equity  premium narrows significantly but remains 
at historically high levels over the next two years.  The real trade-weighted dollar is 
projected to depreciate nearly 3 percent in 2009 and almost 4 percent in 2010.  In line 
with futures quotes, the price of West Texas intermediate crude oil is expected to rise 
slowly from $74 per barrel in the current qu arter to $83 per barrel by the end of 2010, 
a level that is almost $25 per barrel lower than in the September forecast. 
(28) Against this backdrop, the projected pa th for output follows a notably lower 
trajectory than in the last forecast; real GDP is now estimated to have contracted at an 
annual rate of 1 percent in the third quarter  of 2008 and is projected to decline at 
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)
24 of 45
   
average annual rates of about 1¼ percent in the current quarter and 1½ percent in the 
first quarter of 2009.  Over the remainder of 2009, GDP is projected to grow at an annual rate of only ¼ per cent, held down by tight lending standards and strained 
financial conditions that improve only slowly.  In 2010, as financia l strains continue to 
ebb, GDP expands at its potential growth ra te of 2¼ percent.  As a consequence of 
the economic weakness through the end of next  year, the unemployment rate rises to 
7¼ percent by the end of 2009, about 2½ percentage points above the staff’s estimate 
of the NAIRU.  This substantial amount of slack, coupled with a lower path for 
energy prices, leads to a marked deceleration in prices.  Core PCE inflation, which is 
projected at an annual rate of 2¼ percen t in the current quarter, moderates to 1½ 
percent in 2009 and 1¼ percent in 2010.  The recent drop in energy prices should 
cause overall consumer prices to fall at an  annual rate of 2¼ percent in the current 
quarter; overall prices increase  about 1½ percent on average.  
Monetary Policy Strategies 
(29) As shown in Chart 7, the Greenbook-consistent measure of short-run r* has 
been revised down about 2¾ percentage po ints since the September Bluebook.  It 
now stands at about -3 percent, several percentage points below its value at the 
previous cyclical trough in mid-2003.  The magnitude of the downward shift since the 
last Bluebook reflects the sharp deteriorat ion in the staff’s outlook for aggregate 
demand: The severity of strains in domestic  financial markets has translated into a 
marked fall in equity prices, higher corporate bonds rates, and tighter credit 
conditions for households and businesses; an d the intensification of global financial 
market turmoil, a higher dollar and weaker foreign activity have led to less favorable prospects for the demand for U.S. exports.  The estimate of short-run r* from the 
small structural model—which incorporates these financial pressures only through the 
effects of a wider equity premium—has mo ved down about 110 basis points since the

long-run Greenbook forecast beyond 2010.8  These simulations impose a lower 
bound of zero on the nominal funds rate an d abstract from any potential stimulus 
from non-standard policy tools (see box on “Possible Constraints on Monetary Policy at Very Low Nominal Interest Rates”).  For an inflation goal of either 1½ percent or 
2 percent (the left-hand and right-hand sets of charts, respectively), the optimal control simulations prescribe a trajectory for th e federal funds rate that declines to the 
zero lower bound by mid-2009 and remains at that rate through mid-2012.  Optimal 
policy is significantly constrained by the zero lower bound in these simulations; 
indeed, the funds rate would fall much fu rther if the zero lower bound were not 
imposed on the optimal control policy.
9  Because monetary poli cy is unable to provide 
adequate stimulus over the next several yea rs, the unemployment rate rises to around 
7 percent next year and remains above the NAIRU through 2012.  Given the 
persistence of this slack, core PCE inflatio n troughs near 1¼ percent in early 2012.  
Under either inflation objective, the economy is still not in equilibrium after five years, 
and further adjustments in policy are needed to ensure that inflation ultimately settles 
down at the desired rate and output returns to its balanced-growth path. 
                                           
8 In these simulations, policymakers place equa l weight on keeping core PCE inflation close 
to a specified goal, on keepin g unemployment close to the NA IRU, and on avoiding changes 
in the nominal funds rate.

 Possible Constraints on Monetary Policy at Very Low Nominal Int erest Rates 
Given the recent sharp deterioration in th e economic outlook, the Committee may see  
a real possibility of substantial further easi ng of monetary policy in coming quarters,  
with the federal funds rate falling to record lows.1  For example, under the staff’s baseline  
outlook, optimal control simulations of the FR B/US model bring the funds rate to zero  
and maintain that rate into 2012 (Chart 8), wh ile the empirical outcome-based rule prescribes 
a zero funds rate from mid-2009 to late 2010 (Chart 9); indeed , the funds rate would become 
negative in those simulations if a lo wer bound of zero were not imposed. 
The lower bound on 
short-term nominal interest rates arises from the fact that investors  
can always choose to hold currency, which pays  a zero interest rate, instead of other  
financial assets.  In principle, this lower bound could be slightly negative, because holding 
large amounts of cash incurs storage and security costs that reduce its effective rate of  return below zero.  In practice, however, a target of zero percent for the federal funds rate 
might well be associated with slightly positiv e effective rates, reflecting compensation for 
risk in interbank lending.  In Japan, for exam ple, the one-week interbank rate was typically  
at a few basis points from March 2001 to July  2006—a period when the Bank of Japan  
kept the overnight call rate at zero—while th e magnitude of occasional spikes was limited  
by the discount rate, which was maintain ed a notch higher at 10 basis points.  
Reducing the funds rate to very low levels co uld have significant effects on the functioning 
of various financial markets and institutions and might well trigger substantial structural 
changes, especially if very low rates were ma intained for a substantia l period.  Transactions 
volumes in money markets likely would diminish  significantly.  Yields on assets held  
in money market mutual funds might not be high enough to cover the overhead costs  
of managing those funds.  In the short run, funds might have to waive those management 
fees, and over time the industry might need to move to an explicit fee structure analogous to 
that already in effect for some types of deposi ts at commercial banks.  Given that overnight 
interest charges would not provide any incentive  to deliver on promised Treasury securities, 
fails-to-deliver in the Treasury market would likely become increasingly pervasive. Such 
developments could initially prove  disruptive but might eventually lead market participants 
to incorporate explicit penaltie s for failures to deliver.   
Even when the setting of the nominal interest rate is constrained by the zero lower bound,  
a central bank can use other tools to provid e monetary stimulus.  One such approach, 
known as quantitative easing, involves the injection of additional liquidity into the banking 
system beyond that required for keeping the ove rnight interbank rate at zero.  However,  
the evidence from the Japanese experien ce with quantitative easing—in which excess 
reserves expanded from a negligible quantity in early 2001 to about five times the level  
of required reserves by late 200 3—suggests that this approach may have little or no effect  
on bank lending, although it may have provi ded some stimulus by exerting downward 
pressure on the yen.  A more promising approach  might be to aim at reducing term and  
risk premiums on various financial assets by purchasing those assets in sufficiently large 
quantities.  Event studies suggest that large chan ges in the relative supply of securities have 
had economically significant effects on their yields.

(31) As depicted in Chart 9, given the staff’s forecast the outcome-based policy 
rule prescribes a funds rate that drops to the zero bound by mid-2009 and stays there 
through 2010 before steadily rising to abou t 4¾ percent by the end of 2013.  Over 
much of the period, this trajectory is su bstantially lower than the one currently 
embedded in financial market quotes, under which the funds rate declines to 0.75 
percent in 2009Q1 before rising to a platea u of about 4 percent starting in 2011.  
Stochastic simulations of the FRB/US mo del using the staff’s baseline outlook and 
the outcome-based rule indicate a very high  probability that the funds rate hits and 
stays at the zero bound between mid-2009 and the end of 2010.10  In contrast, 
information from interest rate caps indicates that investors see a relatively high likelihood of substantial monetary policy tigh tening starting in the second half of 
2009.
11   
(32) As shown in the bottom panel of Chart 9, the near-term prescriptions from 
the Taylor (1993, 1999) rules are markedly lower than in the previous Bluebook, 
reflecting the pronounced widening of the ou tput gap and improved readings on core 
inflation.  While these rules depend solely  on the current output gap and the rate of 
core inflation that has occurred over the past year, the first-difference rule depends on three-quarter-ahead forecasts for output growth and core inflation; hence, for either inflation goal, this rule prescribes a dec lining funds rates trajectory that reaches the 
zero bound by the first quarter of 2009.   
                                           
10 The stochastic simulations of the FRB/US  model also incorporate the zero bound 
constraint on the nominal funds rate, and he nce the 70 and 90 percent confidence intervals 
are truncated at zero from the second half of 2009 through mid-2012. 
11 The probability of low interest rates ma y be underestimated because the confidence 
intervals shown in the top right panel of Chart 9 are computed from interest rate caps with 
strike prices between 1 percent and 14 percent.  Interest rate caps with a strike price below 1 
percent are not currently traded.

Policy Alternatives 
(33) This Bluebook presents three alternatives for the Committee’s 
consideration, summarized by the draft stat ements in Table 1.  Under Alternative A 
the federal funds rate target is cut 50 basis points to 1 percent; under Alternative B the 
federal funds rate target is cut 25 basis po ints to 1¼ percent; and under Alternative C 
the federal funds rate target is left unchan ged at 1½ percent.  All three alternatives 
begin by noting the deterioration in fina ncial conditions and the weakened economic 
outlook.  Alternatives B an d C note the plethora of recent policy actions around the 
world, suggesting that these actions will help to promote a return to moderate 
economic growth; Alternative A includes no la nguage to soften it s negative view of 
the outlook for economic activity.  With re spect to inflation, Alternatives A and B 
express confidence that inflation will moderate in coming quarters to levels consistent 
with price stability, whereas Alternative C retains the phrasing from the statement 
following the intermeeting cut on Octobe r 8, which acknowledges reduced upside 
risks to inflation without commen ting on its likely future path. 
(34) If the Committee believes that further monetary policy accommodation is 
appropriate given the deterioration in th e economic outlook, but wishes to adjust 
policy relatively gradually, it may want to reduce the target federal funds rate 25 basis 
points at this meeting as in Alternative B .  Even if members have not revised down 
their forecast for economic activity as much as the staff, they may still believe that 
easing is called for.  In vi ew of the negative tone of the recent economic data, the 
worsening of financial conditions sinc e mid-September, and the reduction of 
inflationary pressures implied by the large drop in energy prices and the outlook for significant economic slack, members may vi ew the 50 basis point intermeeting move 
in early October as only a partial step toward suitably balancing the risks to the 
outlook and think that that action should be augmented with a further policy 
adjustment at this meeting.  At the same  time, members may be less pessimistic about

Policy 
Decision 1. The Federal Open Market 
Committee has decided to lower its 
target for the federal funds rate 50 
basis points to 1½ percent. The Federal Open Market Committee decided today
 to lower its target for 
the federal funds rate 50 basis points to 1
 percent. The Federal Open Market Committee decided today
 to lower its target for 
the federal funds rate 25 basis points 
to 1¼ percent.  The Federal Open Market Committee decided today
 to keep its target for the 
federal funds rate at 1½ percent. 
2.   The Committee took this action in 
light of evidence pointing to a weakening of economic activity and 
a reduction in inflat ionary pressures. 
Incoming economic data suggest that the pace of economic activity 
has slowed markedly in recent 
months.  Moreover, the 
intensification of financial market 
turmoil is likely to exert additional 
restraint on spending, partly by 
further reducing the ability of 
households and businesses to obtain 
credit. The outlook for economic activity has 
weakened, and downside risks to 
growth appear to have increased.  
Consumer spending and industrial 
production have declined in recent 
months, and slowing economic activity 
in many foreign economies is damping 
the prospects for U.S. exports.   
Moreover, the intensification of financial market turmoil is likely to 
exert additional rest raint on spending, 
partly by further reducing the ability of households and businesses to obtain 
credit.  The pace of economic activity appears 
to have slowed markedly, owing 
importantly to a decline in consumer 
expenditures.   Moreover, the 
intensification of financial market turmoil is likely to exert additional 
restraint on spending, partly by further 
reducing the ability of households and 
businesses to obtain credit. Reflecting in part the intensification of 
financial market turmoil, the outlook for 
economic activity has weakened.  
Consumer spending and industrial 
production have declined in recent 
months.  However, policy actions taken 
in recent weeks, including coordinated 
interest rate cuts by central banks, 
extraordinary liquidity measures, and 
official steps to strengthen financial 
systems, should help over time to  
improve credit condit ions and promote a 
return to moderate economic growth.   
Rationale 
3.   Inflation has been high, but the 
Committee believes that the decline 
in energy and other commodity 
prices and the weaker prospects for 
economic activity have reduced the 
upside risks to inflation. In light of the decline s in the prices of  
energy and other commodit ies and the 
weaker prospects for economic activity , the Committee expects 
inflation to moderate in coming 
quarters to levels consistent with price 
stability.  In light of the decline s in the prices of  
energy and other commodit ies and the 
weaker prospects for economic activity , the Committee expects 
inflation to moderate in coming 
quarters to levels consistent with price 
stability.  Inflation has been high, but the Committee believes that the decline s
 in 
the prices of energy and other 
commodit ies and the weaker prospects 
for economic activity have reduced the upside risks to inflation. 
Assessment 
of Risk 4.   The Committee will monitor 
economic and financial 
developments carefully and will act 
as needed to promote sustainable 
economic growth and price stability. The Committee will monitor 
economic and financial developments 
carefully and will act as needed to 
promote sustainable economic growth 
and price stability. Policy actions taken in recent weeks, 
including coordinated interest rate cuts  
by central banks, extraordinary 
liquidity measures, and official steps to 
strengthen financia l systems, should 
help over time to improve credit 
conditions  and promote a return to 
moderate economic growth.  
Nevertheless, significant downside 
risks to growth remain.  The 
Committee will monitor economic and 
financial developments carefully and 
will act as needed to promote 
sustainable economic growth and price 
stability. In these circumstances, the Committee’s  
primary concern is th e downside risks to 
growth.   The Committee will monitor 
economic and financial developments carefully in light of the recent policy 
actions and  will act as needed to 
promote sustainable economic growth 
and price stability.

the outlook than the staff for several reas ons and hence believe that more limited 
policy action than assumed in the Greenbook is appropriate.  For example, they may 
believe that financial conditi ons will improve sooner than assumed by the staff, as in 
the Greenbook’s “More Rapid Financial Recovery” scenario.  Or, they may think that passage of a second fiscal stimulus package is likely and perhaps that such a package could be larger or more potent than those presented in the Greenbook’s “Fiscal 
Stimulus” scenarios.  Although these Gree nbook alternative scenarios indicate that 
more policy easing would still be desirable,  they might suggest less urgency to take 
further large steps.  Alternatively, should  the Committee share the staff’s downbeat 
economic outlook but see a near-term revers al of policy as costly, members might 
view a series of gradual steps as more pr udent than one or two large moves because 
there is considerable uncertainty surrounding  the outlook, particularly concerning the 
effects of the many official actions recently implemented.  (35) The rationale section of the statemen t accompanying Alternative B would 
begin by noting the deterioration in th e outlook for economic activity, pointing 
specifically to the softening in consumer spending.  The statement would also point 
out that financial market strains have intensified and that the resulting tightening of credit conditions is likely to impose addi tional restraint on spending.  The paragraph 
on inflation would note that recent declines in the prices of energy and other 
commodities, along with greater prospective economic slack, should  cause inflation to 
moderate to levels consistent with pri ce stability.  (See the box “Likely Market 
Interpretation of Price Stability Language.”)  The change in wording, from reduced 
upside risks in the October 8 statement to an expected moderation of inflation in the 
language for Alternative B, suggests th at Committee members have become much 
more confident that inflation will decl ine.  The final paragraph would note the 
numerous policy steps already taken in recent  weeks to increase liquidity in financial 
markets, strengthen financial systems around the world, and promote economic 
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)
34 of 45
   
growth.  While indicating that these acti ons should support economic activity going 
forward, the statement also notes that they have not eliminated downside risks.  The 
statement concludes with the final sentence of the October 8 statement, highlighting 
the Committee’s intention to act as needed in support of its objectives. 
 
(36) According to the Desk’s survey on October 20, primary dealers assigned 
roughly 40 percent probabilities to both 25 basis point and 50 basis point cuts in the 
federal funds target at this meeting, with  a 20 percent probability of no change.  The 
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)
35 of 45
   
mean of dealers’ expectations for the targ et funds rate was 1.2 percent, which is 
slightly above the rate of 1.1 percent implied by federal funds futures contracts at the 
time of the Desk’s survey.  Because futures contracts refer to the effective funds rate 
rather than the target rate, the differenc e between the dealer expectations and the 
futures rate may reflect the possibility that federal funds will continue to trade below 
the target in coming weeks; 12 it is likely that at the time of the Desk’s survey, both 
dealers and futures market participants expected  a cut in the target funds rate of about 
30 basis points.  However, over subseque nt days, rates on federal funds futures 
contracts closing after the October meetin g have declined another 10 basis points 
amid investor concerns about the ec onomic outlook, and they now suggest 
expectations of about 40 basis points of ea sing at the upcoming meeting.  Thus, a 25 
basis point cut to 1¼ percen t would leave the target federal funds rate somewhat 
above current market expectations.  Nevertheless, the clear shift in the statement language away from concern about inflation risks and toward an emphasis on growth risks would likely lead investors to anticipa te further rate cuts, and this alternative 
appears broadly consistent with readings for the funds rate at the end of the year that 
are implied by futures markets.  As a resu lt, our best estimate is that adoption of 
Alternative B would have only small eff ects on prices of financial assets.  
(37)  If the Committee, like the staff, has marked down significantly its 
assessment of economic prospects and now s ees an immediate and substantial policy 
response as appropriate, it may want to re duce the target federal funds rate 50 basis 
points at this meeting, as in Alternative A .  Recent economic data releases have been 
almost all weaker than anticipated, with consumer outlays down sharply.  Moreover, 
financial conditions have deteriorated su bstantially since the September meeting:  
Equity prices fell sharply ov er the intermeeting period; mortgage rates moved higher; 
                                           
12 The October 22 announcement of a decrease in the spread between the target federal 
funds rate and the rate of interest paid on ex cess reserve balances had little apparent effect 
on futures rates. 
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)

corporate bond yields jumped; and the Oct ober Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey 
shows that extraordinarily high percentage s of banks tightened standards and terms 
on loans to businesses and households over th e past three months.  With regard to 
inflation, the latest news on commodity prices and inflation expectations, in 
conjunction with the appreciat ion of the dollar in recent months and the likelihood of 
a marked increase in economic slack, provides  substantial assurance that inflation will 
moderate.  Even if the Committee has not  marked down its outlook for the economy 
as much as the staff, it may view the down side risks as having increased.  Moreover, 
with the Greenbook-consistent measure of th e equilibrium real funds rate having 
dropped about 2 percentage points below the le vel of the current real rate, even a less 
pessimistic outlook than the Greenbook’s could be consistent with a considerable 
further reduction in the target federal funds rate.  
(38) The rationale section of the statemen t for Alternative A highlights the 
recent deterioration in financial and economic conditions, with specific references to weak consumer spending and industrial pr oduction and to the slowdown in foreign 
economic growth.  As under Alternative B, th e section also points out the likely future 
spending restraint implied by the further tightening of financial conditions.  The 
discussion of inflation woul d be identical to that unde r Alternative B, noting the 
reasons to expect a moderation of inflation to levels consistent with price stability.  
The assessment of risk would emphasize the Committee’s readiness to act as needed 
to promote growth.  (39) A 50 basis point cut is near the high end of market expectations for policy 
easing at this meeting.  Moreover, the statement language suggests that the Committee 
is prepared to reduce rates further, and thus market participants would presumably 
lower their expected trajectory for the federa l funds rate over the next few quarters.  
Short- and intermediate-term interest rates would probably drop noticeably.  Long-
term interest rates might decline modestly, though if market participants interpret the 
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)
37 of 45
   
statement as a sign that the Committee is underestimating inflation risks, long-term 
rates could rise.  The effect on equity pr ices would depend on whether markets are 
comforted by the prospect of more mone tary ease or concerned by the gloomy 
assessment of the outlook and risks. (40) If the Committee believes that the economic outlook has not deteriorated as 
much as in the staff forecast or that there is still a significant risk that inflation will not 
moderate as expected, it might prefer to le ave the stance of policy unchanged, as in 
Alternative C .  Although recent readings on real activity have been very weak, a wide 
range of monetary and other policy measures have been implemented recently, and members may feel that a gradual improvemen t of financial conditions could be in 
train.  Indeed, many yield spreads have be en narrowing and liquidity measures have 
been improving gradually in recent days, albe it from highly strained levels.  If this 
process continues in coming weeks, the cumulative improvement in financial 
conditions could be substantial.  Also, the Committee may place a high probability on 
a major new fiscal stimulus package be ing enacted soon; no fiscal package was 
factored into the staff’s projection.  More over, members may be skeptical of the staff 
projection of a sharp reduction in inflati on, perhaps feeling that it is based on 
assumptions that may prove to be overly optimistic.  For example, the Committee may not have confidence in the sharply lower trajectory for energy prices suggested by 
futures markets; energy prices are highly volatile and futures market quotes over the past few years have been unreliable guides to subsequent developments.  And some members may not put much stock in the notion that slack in labor and product 
markets will restrain future price pressure s, but may instead worry that a very low 
funds rate will fuel rising  inflation expectations, as illustrated in the Greenbook’s 
“Faster Inflation” scenario.  Indeed, members may want to see several months of lower data on inflation and inflation expect ations before they feel comfortable with 
further reductions in the policy target.

(41) The first part of the rationale portion of the statement associated with 
Alternative C would acknowledge the recent  deterioration in economic and financial 
conditions.  The second part would point to the wide range of recent policy actions, 
noting that they should help to promote growth over time.  The discussion of the 
outlook for inflation would be essentially identical to that in the October 8 statement, which focused on a reduction in upside risks rather than a material reduction in the modal forecast.  Finally, the risk assessment under Alternative C begins by stating that 
the balance of risks has shifted toward downside risks to growth.  The section 
concludes with a modification of the risk  assessment of the October 8 statement, 
pointing to the possible effects of past polic y actions as something the Committee will 
be watching particularly closely.   
(42) Given the high odds embedded in fina ncial market prices of at least a 25 
basis point cut at this meet ing, a decision to adopt Al ternative C would surprise 
market participants, leading to an appreciab le upward revision of their short-term 
outlook for the path of policy and probably an increase in short-and intermediate-
term interest rates.  Equity prices would likely fall, perhaps substantially.  Financial 
market strains would probably increase and private yields would rise. 
Money and Debt Forecasts 
(43) M2 is projected to grow at a 7½ percen t annual rate this year, significantly 
above the rate anticipated in September and faster than the projected growth rate of 
nominal GDP.  The major factor behind rapid growth of M2 this yea r is the decline in 
short-term interest rates and the associated drop in the opportunity cost of holding 
M2 assets.  A portfolio shift toward safe and liquid assets may also be playing a role.  
M2 is projected to decelerate to a pace of roughly 3 percent in 2009 and 2010, 
reflecting weak growth in nom inal GDP in 2009 and a rising  opportunity cost in 2010. 
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)

(44) Debt growth in the private sector is expected to be weak over the next two 
years.  Household debt is projected to be e ssentially flat in 2009 and to expand only a 
little in 2010, held down by falling home prices and tighter bank lending terms and 
standards.  Nonfinancial busine ss debt is projected to grow at a moderate rate, down 
sharply from rapid growth rates in recent years, also restrained in part by tight credit 
conditions.  By contrast, debt is projected to grow rapidly in the government sectors, 
as the economic slowdown damps revenues, and as financing needs related to the 
TARP, Treasury’s assistance to the GSEs, and higher expected losses at the FDIC boost federal debt substantially in 2009 an d 2010.  Overall, do mestic nonfinancial 
debt is projected to grow 2¾ percent in 2009 and 4¼ percent in 2010, a very subdued 
pace by historical standards.

(45) Draft language for the dir ective is provided below. 
Directive Wording 
The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial 
conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth 
in output.  To further its long-r un objectives, the Committee in the 
immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with 
MAINTAINING/INCREASING/reducing the federal funds rate AT/to an average of arou nd ________ 1½ percent.

Appendix A: Measures of the  Equilibrium Real Rate 
 
The equilibrium real rate is the real  federal funds rate that, if maintained, would be projected to return 
output to its potential level over time.   The short-run equilibrium rate is  defined as the rate that would 
close the output gap in twelve qua rters given the corresponding model’s projection of the economy.   
The medium-run concept is the value of  the real federal funds rate proj ected to keep ou tput at potential 
in seven years, under the assumption that monetary policy acts to bring actua l and potential output into 
line in the short run and then keeps them equal thereafter.  The TIPS-based factor model measure 
provides an estimate of market expectations for the real federal funds rate seven years ahead.  
 The actual real federal funds rate is  constructed as the difference betw een the nom
 inal rate and realized 
inflation, where the nomi
nal rate is measured as the quarterly average of the observed federal funds rate, 
and realized inflation is given by the log difference between the co re PCE price index and its lagged 
value four quarters earlier.  For th e current quarter, the nominal rate is specified as the target federal 
funds rate on the Bluebook publication date.  For the current quarter and th e previous quarter, the 
inflation rate is computed using the staff’s estimat e of the core PCE price i ndex. If the upcoming FOMC 
meeting falls early in the quarter, the lagged in flation measure ends in the last quarter.   
 Confidence intervals reflect uncertainties about model specification, coefficients, and the level of 
potential output.  The final column of the table in dicates the values published in the previous Bluebook. 
   
Measure Description 
Single-equation 
Model  The measure of the equilibrium real rate in the single-equation model is based on an 
estimated aggregate-demand relationship between  the current value of the output gap and 
its lagged values as well as the lagged va lues of the real federal funds rate. 
Small Structural 
Model  The small-scale model of the economy consists  of equations for six variables: the output 
gap, the equity premium, the federal budget surp lus, the trend growth rate of output, the 
real bond yield, and the real federal funds rate. 
Large Model 
(FRB/US) Estimates of the equilibrium real rate using FRB/US—the staff’s large-scale econometric 
model of the U.S. economy—depend on a very broad array of economic factors, some of 
which take the form of projected valu es of the model’s exogenous variables. 
Greenbook-
consistent  The FRB/US model is used in conjunction with an extended version of the Greenbook 
forecast to derive a Greenbook-consistent measure .  FRB/US is first add-factored so that 
its simulation matches the extended Greenbook forecast, and then a second simulation is 
run off this baseline to determine the value of the real federal funds rate that closes the 
output gap. 
TIPS-based 
Factor Model Yields on TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) reflect investors’ expectations of the future path of real interest rates, but also include term and liquidity premiums.  The 
TIPS-based measure of the equilibrium real ra te is constructed using the seven-year-ahead 
instantaneous real forward rate derived fro m TIPS yields as of the Bluebook publication 
date.  This forward rate is adjusted to remove estimates of the term and liquidity 
premiums based on a three-factor arbitrage -free term-structure model applied to TIPS 
yields, nominal yields, and inflation.  Because TIPS indexation is based on the total CPI, 
this measure is also adjusted for the me dium-term difference—projected at 40 basis 
points—between total CPI inflation and core PCE inflation.

Appendix B: Analysis of Policy Paths and Confidence Intervals  
 
Rule Specifications :  For the following rules, it denotes the federal funds rate for quarter t , while  
the explanatory variables include the staff’s projec tion of trailing four-quart er core PCE inflation ( πt), 
inflation two and three quarters ahead ( πt+2|t and π t+3|t), the output gap in the current period and one 
quarter ahead ( yy*
tt−  and yy*
tt++1|−t1|t), and the three-quarter-ahead forecast of annual average GDP 
growth relative to potential ( Δ−44yy*
tt++3|Δt3|t), and π* denotes an assumed value of policymakers’ 
long-run inflation objective.  The outcome-based a nd forecast-based rules were estimated using real-
time data over the sample 1988:1-2006:4; each specifi cation was chosen using the Bayesian information 
criterion. Each rule incorporates a 75 basis point shift in the interc ept, specified as a sequence of  
25 basis point increments during the first three quarters of 1998.  The first two simple rules were 
proposed by Taylor (1993, 1999).  The prescriptions  of the first-difference rule do not depend on 
assumptions regarding r*  or the level of the outpu t gap; see Orphanides (2003).

First-difference rule it = i t-1 + 0.5(πt+3|t –*π) + 0.5(44*
3| 3| tt ttyy+ + Δ− Δ ) 
 
FRB/US Model Simulations :  Prescriptions from the two empiri cal rules are computed using dynamic 
simulations of the FRB/US model, implemented as though the rule were followed starting at this FOMC 
meeting.  The dotted line labeled “Previous Bluebook” is  based on the current specification of the policy 
rule, applied to the previous Gr eenbook projection.  Confidence intervals are based on stochastic 
simulations of the FRB/US model with shocks drawn from the estimated residuals over 1986-2005.  
Information from Financial Markets :  The expected funds rate path is based on forward rate 
agreements, and the confidence intervals for this path are constructed using prices of interest rate caps. 
Near-Term Prescriptions of Simple Policy Rules :  These prescriptions are calculated using Greenbook 
projections for inflation and the output gap. Because the first-difference rule involves the lagged funds 
rate, the value labeled “Previous Bluebook” for the curr ent quarter is computed using the actual value  
of the lagged funds rate, and the one -quarter-ahead prescriptions are ba sed on this rule’s prescription for 
the current quarter.
