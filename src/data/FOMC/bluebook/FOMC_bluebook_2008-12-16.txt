MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES 
Recent Developments 
Summary 
(1) Financial markets remained under seve re strain over the intermeeting 
period.  Although there were signs of  improvement in some money markets, 
conditions continued to be poor, spread s were elevated, and year-end pressures 
emerged.  The Treasury’s announcement on November 12 that funds from the 
Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) woul d not be used to purchase securities 
backed by mortgage-related and other assets  elicited a negative price reaction in 
several financial markets.  Intensifying co ncerns about the financial condition of 
Citigroup and the potential systemic implic ations of its failure prompted the U.S. 
government to intervene to provide financ ial support.  In response to deteriorating 
conditions in credit markets, the Fede ral Reserve announced  on November 25 the 
creation of the Term Asset-Backed Securi ties Loan Facility (TALF) and also a 
program to conduct large-scale outright purc hases of debt issued by housing-related 
GSEs and mortgage-backed securities (MBS ) backed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, 
and Ginnie Mae.  On net, the sharp deteri oration in the outlook for economic growth 
led market participants to mark down substa ntially the expected path of monetary 
policy over the intermeeting period, and they now appear to expect a 50 basis point cut in the target federal funds rate at the upcoming FOMC meeting.  Yields on 
nominal Treasuries plunged and TIPS-bas ed measures of inflation compensation 
declined.  In the corporate sector, broad e quity price indexes moved lower while risk 
spreads soared over the intermeeting period.  Although issuance of nonfinancial investment-grade bonds was solid in Nove mber, speculative-grade debt issuance 
continued to be nil.  Bank lending exhibited broad weakness in November.  
   
Household credit declined in the third quarter.  Numerous foreign central banks eased 
monetary policy considerably amid signs of a worldwide economic slowdown.    
Financial Institutions 
(2) Investor concerns about the conditi on of financial institutions mounted 
over the intermeeting period.  Credit de fault swap (CDS) spreads for U.S. banks 
widened notably, and their equity prices fell, likely reflecting in part sharp declines in 
the value of mortgage-related and other assets (Chart 1).  Anxiety about the financial 
condition of Citigroup intensified, especia lly in the wake of the firm’s announcement 
that it would lay off 52,000 workers and ab sorb $17 billion in distressed assets from 
structured investment vehicles.  To su pport financial market stability, the U.S. 
government on November 23 entered into an  agreement with Citigroup to provide a 
package of capital, guarantees, and liquidity access.1  Banking organizations began to 
take advantage of the FDIC’s Temporary Li quidity Guarantee Program, with twelve 
institutions issu
ing roughly $70 billion in bonds under the program (see the box 
entitled “The FDIC’s Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program”). 
(3) Other financial instit utions also came under pressure over the intermeeting 
period.  CDS spreads for insurance compan ies remained elevated, possibly reflecting 
concerns regarding the prospective profitabilit y of these firms as well as declines in 
the values of their investment portfolios.  Equity prices of insurance companies slipped lower, on net, over the intermeeting period.  REITs were significantly affected 
by the deterioration in the commercial mort gage market, and their equity valuations 
fell and CDS spreads surged.  Average retu rns of hedge funds were negative for a 
                                           
1 As part of the agreement, the Treasury an d FDIC will provide protection against outsized 
losses on a pool of about $306 billion in reside ntial and commercial real estate and other 
assets.  Under this arrangement, Citigroup will issue preferred shares to the Treasury and 
FDIC.  In addition and if necessary, the Federal Reserve stands ready to backstop residual 
risk in the asset pool through a non-recourse lo an.  Moreover, the Treasury will purchase an 
additional $20 billion in Citigroup preferred stock using TARP funds.

The FDIC’s Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program 
On October 14, the Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corporation (FDIC) announced a Temporary Liquidity 
Guarantee Program (TLGP) to help improve market 
confidence in the
 U.S. banking system.  An interim rule was 
published on November 3, and a final rule was released November 21.  The TLGP has two components:  The 
Transaction Account Guarantee Program (TAGP) and the 
Debt Guarantee Program (DGP).  The TAGP covers 
(through December 31, 2009) a ll balances in noninterest 
bearing transactions accounts in excess of the deposit insurance limit of $250,000, as well as certain additional 
accounts (such as NOW accounts with interest rates of 0.5% per year or less), held at FDIC-insured depository 
institutions. Demand deposits ha ve soared, registering over 
150 percent annualized growth in November, in part because of the TAGP.  Reportedly some institutional 
investors are leaving funds in these accounts rather than 
earn very low rates in other money markets, particularly the 
repo market.  In addition, some large time deposits—which 
are not covered by this program—have reportedly been 
converted to demand deposits to benefit from the 
guarantee. 
The DGP covers certain new senior unsecured obligations 
issued by FDIC-insured depositor y institutions and by most of 
their parent holding companies.  The guarantee covers all new debt with maturity over one month, up to a cap based on 
senior debt outstanding as of September 30, 2008.
1  All 
guaranteed debt issued by Ju ne 30, 2009 is covered until 
maturity or until June 30, 2012 , whichever is sooner.  Fees 
associated with this program ra nge from 50 basis points for 
debt with maturities of 180 days or less to 100 basis points for 
maturities beyond 360 days.   
 
 
 
 
   
1Eligible instruments consist of federal funds, promissory notes, commercial 
paper, unsubordinated unsecured notes, and interbank deposits (including CDs, 
deposits in an International Banking Facility, and Eurodollar deposits).  In its final rule, the FDIC excluded obligations with maturities of less than 30 days and will not collect fees against those obligations.  The final rule also gives the FDIC 
discretion to adjust firms’ use of the program on a case-by-case basis.

    Initial inclusion in the TLGP was automatic, with eligible institutions having until December 5 
to decide whether they wanted to continue partic ipating in the program or  to opt out of one or 
both of the DGP and the TAGP.  Virtually all large institutions chose to participate in both 
components of the TLGP.  The FDIC reports that about 800 institutions have opted out of the 
TAGP and more than 3000 have opted out of th e DGP.  However, FDIC staff indicate that 
there has been some confusion regarding particip ation in the DGP, and these numbers are likely 
to be revised.        
Issuance of debt under the DGP began in late  November.  As shown in the table on the 
previous page, eligible institutions have issued about $70 billion in notes, primarily denominated 
in U.S. dollars, with maturities ranging from December 2010 to June 20 12.  Roughly one-third 
of the issuance has been floating  rate.  The FDIC estimates that  issuance of senior unsecured 
bank notes under the DGP could eventually total as much as $500 billion.  Debt issued under 
this program has thus far traded at spreads to Treasuries somewhat wider than those of comparable-maturity agency debt but substantia lly lower than those of corporate notes not 
subject to the guarantee.  There are some nota ble differences in spreads on these debt issues 
across institutions.  Moreover, the differences in  spreads across firms appear to be correlated 
with differences in CDS premiums.  In part, the difference in yields on guaranteed debt instruments may reflect investor uncertainty rega rding the FDIC's payout process in the event 
of default.  Market participants reportedly indicated that, with a significant amount of DGP debt expected to be issued over coming mont hs, and with the Federal Reserve expected to 
purchase large quantities of agency debt, the diffe rence in spreads between these assets is likely 
to persist.  Nonetheless, DGP debt spreads have generally narrowed since issuance, amid 
reportedly notable trading volumes as investor s have become familiar with the program.

sixth consecutive month in November, although  recent losses were not nearly as large 
as those in September and October.  In the wake of their recent poor performance, 
hedge funds have reportedly experienced considerable net redemptions, with some 
estimates suggesting that October outflows e qualed about 2 percent of industry assets 
under management.  Further, year-end rede mption requests appeared to continue to 
weigh on the industry.  To meet actual and expected redemption requests, hedge 
funds were said to have liquidated positions, likely exacerbating asset price declines in several markets.  Meanwhile, prime money market mutual funds (MMMFs), which 
had experienced outflows in September and October, posted net inflows over the intermeeting period.  The inflows likely reflect ed an easing of investor concerns about 
the safety and liquidity of these funds, ow ing to the Treasury’s Temporary Guarantee 
Program and the support provided by several Federal Reserve facilities.  
Market Functioning 
(4) Money markets remained strained over the intermeeting period, particularly 
at terms beyond overnight, although ther e were some signs of improvement.  In 
unsecured interbank funding markets, Libo r fixings at most maturities declined 
notably early in the period and spreads over comparable-maturity overnight index 
swap (OIS) rates narrowed further from the record levels reached in October (Chart 
2).  The one-month spread initially jumped  as that maturity crossed year-end but has 
narrowed again in recent days as the Libor fixing declined.  Trading in longer-term 
interbank funding markets repor tedly remained thin.     
(5) In secured funding markets, conditions continued to be strained over the 
intermeeting period.  Amid high demand fo r safe investments, the overnight general 
collateral (GC) repo rate remained very low and fell to around zero late in the 
intermeeting period.  Fails to deliver in th e Treasury market came down substantially 
from the extraordinary levels reached in October and overnight securities lending

from the SOMA portfolio fell sharply, al though these declines came against a 
backdrop of sharply lower transaction volu me as investors have reportedly become 
less willing to lend collateral out of fear that  it will not be returned and as some large 
dealers are reportedly reducing the amount of collateral they are supplying to the 
market ahead of year-end.  However, fails have picked up somewhat in recent days as 
the GC repo rate reached zero.  The low level of SOMA lending may in part be due to a high fee relative to market rates.  Demand for safe instruments was also apparent in 
the Treasury bill market, where yields turned negative at times.  During the 
intermeeting period, the Treasury announced th at it would not roll over bills related to 
the Supplementary Financing Program (SFP) , for the stated reason of preserving 
flexibility in managing debt policy, and un certainty about supply, combined with a 
perceived lack thereof, appeared to exacer bate poor conditions in the bill market.  
Despite the decline in spreads over Treasury GC rates later in the period, strains in 
markets for repo transactions backed by agency and MBS collateral remained evident, 
with bid-asked spreads and haircuts very elevated.  
(6) In contrast, conditions in the commerc ial paper (CP) market improved over 
the intermeeting period, reflecting importantly the recent measures taken by the 
Federal Reserve in support of this market.   Spreads on 30-day A1/P1 financial and 
asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) continued to narrow after the Commercial 
Paper Funding Facility (CPFF) became opera tional on October 27, although spreads 
subsequently reversed a portion of the declin es as maturities crossed over year-end.  
By contrast, spreads on A2/P2 paper—which is not eligible for purchase under the 
CPFF—stayed extremely elevated.  The dollar amounts of unsecured financial CP and 
ABCP outstanding rebounded from their October lows, though this increase was 
more than accounted for by issuance into the CPFF.  As of December 10, credit 
extended under the CPFF totaled $311 bil lion.  Credit extended under the Asset-
Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Mutu al Fund Liquidity Facility (AMLF) fell 
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)

by more than half over the intermeeting pe riod, to $34 billion.  Thus far, the Money 
Market Investor Funding Facility (MMIFF) program has registered no activity.  The 
low demand for credit from the AMLF and MMIFF likely reflects the recent net flows 
into money market mutual funds, the institut ions that the two facilities were designed 
to support. 
(7) Strains remained evident or even intensified in a number of long-term 
financial markets over the period.  The functioning of the market for Treasury 
coupon securities remained impaired.  The on-the-run premium for the ten-year 
nominal Treasury security surged higher from already elevated levels.  Trading 
volumes in the Treasury market continued to decline and bid-asked spreads were abnormally wide.  Liquidity in the cor porate bond market was also impaired for 
speculative-grade bonds, while conditions have  improved somewhat in recent months 
for investment-grade bonds.  In the CDS market, liquidity and price discovery 
apparently remained poor, based on the number of dealers providing quotes and the range of dealer quotes.  The announcement by the Treasury on November 12 that 
TARP funds would not be used to purchase mortgage-related and other assets 
sparked a sharp decline in various asset prices.  The sello ff was particularly 
pronounced in the market for commercial mo rtgage-backed securities (CMBS), with 
an index of CDS spreads on AAA-rated CM BS widening 310 basis points, on net, 
over the intermeeting period.  Secondary mar ket prices of syndicated leveraged loans 
also declined to new record lows and im plied spreads on the LCDX index soared to 
record levels, as hedge funds reportedly unloaded their holdings of leveraged loans 
and as collateralized loan obligations came  under significant pressure.  Average bid-
asked spreads in the syndicated loan marke t widened further, on net.         
(8) Depository institutions continued to  make heavy use of the discount 
window.  Although primary credit outstandin g declined somewhat in recent weeks, it 
stood at $90 billion as of December 10.  Recent TAF auctions, for both 28-day and 
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)
9 of 60
   
84-day credit, were undersubscribed; the size of the auctions had been raised, and the 
number of bidders remained relatively stea dy.  Overall, credit extended under the 
TAF increased about $150 billion to $448 bill ion.  Bidding was especially light for the 
two forward TAF auctions conducted over the intermeeting period—each for $150 billion in short-term credit over year-end.   While a number of the Term Securities 
Lending Facility (TSLF) auctions held over the period were oversubscribed, the two most recent auctions were undersubscribed.  Market participants exercised only $8 
billion of the options on $50 billion of TS LF loans against Schedule 2 collateral on 
their November 24 exercise date.  Howeve r, the auction offeri ng $50 billion in 
options for 13-day Schedule 2 TSLF loans straddling the year-turn was oversubscribed, with investors reportedly attributing the reception to the current 
strong demand for Treasury collateral.  Use of the Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF) declined significantly over the inte rmeeting period, fallin g to $52 billion on 
December 10 from $80 billion on October 28.  On November 10, the Treasury and the Federal Reserve announced a restruct uring of the support provided to AIG.
2   
                                           
2 The Treasury announced that it would purcha se $40 billion of newly issued AIG preferred 
shares under the TARP, which allowed the Federal Reserve to reduce from $85 billion to 
$60 billion the total amount available under the credit facility established on September 16.  
Further, the interest rate on that facility was reduced to Libor plus 300 basis points, the fee 
on undrawn funds was reduced to 75 basis points, and the term of the facility was 
lengthened from two years to five years.  The Federal Reserve also announced plans to 
restructure its lending related to AIG by ex tending credit to two newly formed limited 
liability companies.  The first, which will receive a $22.5 billion loan from the Federal 
Reserve and a $1 billion subordinated loan fr om AIG, will purchase residential mortgage-
backed securities from AIG.  No credit has yet b een extended to this facility.  As a result of 
this facility, the securities lending facility es tablished by the New York Federal Reserve Bank 
on October 8 will be repaid and terminated.  On December 10, the outstanding amount of credit outstanding to AIG, including the origin al loan arrangement and the securities lending 
facility, totaled $57 billion.  Th e second new company will receive  a $30 billion loan from the 
Federal Reserve and a $5 billion subordinated lo an from AIG and will purchase multi-sector 
collateralized debt obligations on which AIG has written CDS contracts.  As of December 10, $20 billion in credit had been extended to this facility.  CPFF credit to AIG as of 
December 10 was $16 billion.

(9) Even though the interest rate paid on excess reserves was raised to the 
lowest target federal funds rate in pla ce during the reserve maintenance period, the 
effective funds rate continued to trade soft to the target, likely reflecting the extremely 
high provision of liquidity through the Fede ral Reserve’s liquidity facilities (see the 
box “Recent Developments in the Federal Funds Market”). 
Monetary Policy Expectations and Treasury Yields 
(10) The FOMC’s decision at its October m eeting to lower the target federal 
funds rate 50 basis points to 1 percent was broadly in line with market expectations 
and elicited only a modest reaction in financial markets.3  However, economic data 
releases that suggested a weaker outlook fo r growth and lower inflation than had been 
anticipated, along with continued strains in  financial markets that  weighed on investor 
sentiment, contributed to a sharp downward revision in the expected path of policy 
over the period (Chart 3).  Responses to the Desk’s survey indicate that primary dealers view a 50 basis point reduction in the target federal funds rate as the most 
likely outcome at the upcoming meeting.  Reading policy expectations from federal 
funds futures and options is not straightforward, as quotes on those instruments reflect expectations that the effective federa l funds rate will continue to average below 
the target for a while (see box “Expected Softness in the Expected Federal Funds 
Rate”).  Federal funds futures indicate that investors expect the effective federal funds 
rate after the December meeting to be ar ound 30 basis points.  Using our standard 
assumption for term premiums, Eurodollar futures quotes suggest that investors 
anticipate that the FOMC will begin graduall y raising the target federal funds rate in 
the summer of next year, with the rate expected to reach about 1.55 percent by the 
                                           
3 The effective federal funds rate averaged 0. 34 percent over the intermeeting period amid 
extraordinary volatility.  Over this intermeet ing period, the volume of long-term repurchase 
agreements was unchanged.  The desk did not re deem any Treasury secu rities.  On net, the 
Desk purchased $2.2 billion in agency securities.

 Recent developments in the federal funds market 
Trading conditions in the federal funds market  over the intermeeting period were influenced 
by various factors including the rate paid on excess reserve balances (the excess rate), further 
increases in the level of reserve balances, the finalization of the FDIC’s Temporary Liquidity 
Guarantee (TLG) program, and, more recently, expectations of policy easing in December.  
There have been some discernable effects of the excess rate on the federal funds market.  Beginning November 6, the Board raised the exce ss rate to the lowest target rate in effect 
over the maintenance period.  After this ch ange, brokered trades at near-zero rates 
essentially ceased and the share of federal fu nds trades brokered at rates below 25 basis 
points fell from 80 percent to 5 percent by the end of the month.  That said, most federal 
funds trades have still occurred at rates below the excess rate, with a significant portion of 
such trades involving sellers that were not e ligible to receive interest on reserves.  While 
arbitrage by institutions eligible to receive in terest on reserves could, in theory, support the 
funds rate, there are reportedly a number of im pediments to this arbitrage.  Large-scale 
purchases of federal funds by eligible institut ions could push their leverage ratios below 
desired levels.  Moreover, many sellers reportedl y tightened their counterparty credit limits, 
limiting buyers’ ability to arbitrage.  Finally, pr ior to the release of the final rule for the 
FDIC’s TLG program on November 21, some bu yers of federal funds were reluctant to 
arbitrage, given the possibility that they coul d face a 75-basis-point guarantee fee.  The 
effective rate edged up after the FDIC anno unced exclusion of federal funds borrowings 
with maturities of a month or less from  coverage under the guarantee program. 
However, once the current maintenance pe
riod encompassing the upcoming FOMC 
meeting began on December 4, the effective rate fell.  Evidently, market participants have 
been expecting a cut in the target rate—and th us the excess rate—of at least 50 basis points.  
In addition, the level of excess reserve bala nces has increased further, reflecting the 
expansion of the Federal Reserve’s liquidity programs and the runoff of the Treasury’s Supplementary Financing Program.  Against this  backdrop, the share of federal funds trades 
brokered at near-zero rates jumped, and brokere d volumes dropped to $70 billion, a level 
well below the average in recent years.

Expected Softness in the Effective Federal Funds Rate  
 
 
 Federal funds have traded appreciably below (o r “soft to”) the target in recent weeks, and 
market participants are likely expecting that th is will continue to be the case after the 
December FOMC meeting, given the large amou nt of excess reserves currently in the 
financial system.  Consequently, rates implie d by federal funds futures, which settle on 
monthly averages of the effective rate, probably reflect continued expectations for softness, 
in addition to anticipated changes in the target rate at the December meeting.  
Disentangling anticipated softness in the eff ective rate after the December meeting and 
expectations for the federal funds rate target es tablished at that meeting is a complicated task
for at least two reasons.  First, the scope for so ftness in the funds rate relative to the target 
could begin to be constrained by the zero bound on nominal interest rates.  And second, 
further increases in reserve balances associated with the expansion of liquidity programs or 
the runoff of Treasury balances under the Supplementary Financing Program could exert 
additional downward pressure on the fund s rate relative to the target rate.  
One simple way to isolate expected softness ov er the very near term is to assume that 
market expectations are equal to those of th e primary dealers surveyed by the Desk.  The 
table below to the left shows the probabilities assigned by primary dealers in the December 8
survey to various target rates after the December meeting.  These probabilities imply that the 
dealers expect the target rate to be lowered to 50 basis points at the December meeting.  Since the expected effective rate implied by federal funds futures after the December 
meeting is about 30 basis points, this target rate  prediction suggests that market participants 
expect the effective rate to average about 20 ba sis points below the target in late December.  
An alternative market-based approach is to look at basis swaps between the prime rate and the effective federal funds rate.  Assuming that  the prime rate will continue to be set at a 
level 3 percentage points above the target rate , one can construct an implied path for the 
target funds rate as shown in column 1 of th e table at the bottom right.  Comparing this 
path with the path for the effective funds ra te implied by OIS rate s (column 2) provides a 
measure of expected softness (column 3).  Althou gh liquidity in this basis swap market is 
somewhat limited, these calculations suggest that  funds rate softness is expected to persist 
over the next few months but to become less pronounced over time.

end of 2010.  However, given the heightened uncertainty about the economic and 
financial outlook, term premiums may be la rger than usual, which would imply that 
investors are expecting less policy tightening. 
(11) In response to the downward revision in the expected policy path and the 
significantly weaker economic outlook, yiel ds on nominal Treasury securities fell 
substantially over the intermeeting period amid reports of strong safe-haven flows.  
Market expectations that the Federal Re serve may begin purchasing longer-term 
Treasury securities also appeared to push long-term yields lower, especially following 
the Chairman’s speech on December 1 in which he pointed to the possibility of substantial purchases of Treasury or agency securities in open market operations.  On 
net, off-the-run two-year Treasury yields fell  95 basis points to 0.55 percent, while off-
the-run ten-year yields dropped 130 basis points to 3.15 percent; the on-the-run ten-year Treasury yield dropped as low as 2.54 per cent, its lowest level in more than four 
decades.  TIPS-based inflation compensation  over the next five years declined 50 
basis points, while inflation compensation five to ten years ahead fell 90 basis points.  
Although these declines occurred amid sharp decreases in inflation measures and energy prices, they were like ly amplified by poor liquidity  conditions in TIPS and 
nominal Treasury markets.  In contrast, comparable measures of inflation compensation obtained from inflation swaps were little changed on net, over the 
intermeeting period.  Near-term expectations  for inflation from the Reuters/Michigan 
and Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank surveys  decreased, consistent with the further 
drop in oil prices, while long-term expectat ions were unchanged.  Primary dealers 
surveyed by the desk lowered their forecast s notably for core PCE inflation in 2009 
but left their long-run forecasts for CPI inflation about the same.

Capital Markets 
(12) As financial market conditions worsened, investors seemed to grow more 
concerned about the likelihood of a deep an d prolonged recession.  Stock prices of 
financial corporations fell notably, while br oad equity indexes declined, on net, amid 
very high volatility (Chart 4).  Led by larg e profit reductions in  the financial sector, 
operating earnings per share for S&P 500 firm s in the third quarter came in about 20 
percent below year-earlier levels.  For nonf inancial firms, earnings per share rose 
about 10 percent, owing almost entirely to gains by firms in the oil and gas industry.  
Looking ahead, analysts marked down substantially their projections for earnings over 
the coming year for both financial and nonfinancial firms, with double-digit declines 
in year-over-year profitability now expected for the fourth quarter in nearly every 
sector.  The spread between the twelve-mon th forward trend earnings-price ratio for 
S&P 500 firms, and the long-term Treasury yield—a rough gauge of the equity risk 
premium—continued to be exceptionally el evated.  Option-implied volatility of the 
S&P 500 remained near its recent record levels.    
(13) Conditions in corporate debt markets tightened further over the period.  
Risk spreads on BBB-rated and speculative-grade bonds soared and risk spreads on 
higher-rated bonds remained extremely elevated.  CDS spreads on investment-grade 
and speculative-grade corporate bonds widene d further.  Gross issuance of bonds by 
nonfinancial investment-grade companies c ontinued at a solid pace, but issuance of 
junk bonds remained at zero.  Issuance of  leveraged syndicated loans remained 
extremely weak.    (14) To help reduce the cost and increase the availability of residential mortgage 
credit, the Federal Reserve announced on No vember 25 a program to purchase up to 
$100 billion in direct obligations of housing-related government-sponsored 
enterprises (GSEs) and up to $500 billion in MBS backed by Fannie Mae, Freddie 
Mac, and Ginnie Mae.  Agency debt spread s, which had widened early in the period,

narrowed sharply on the announcement.  Subse quent purchases of agency debt by the 
Desk were well received and led to a fu rther reduction in agency spreads.  On net 
over the period, agency debt spreads na rrowed 35 basis points while option-adjusted 
spreads on agency MBS declined about 110 basis points.  Likely reflecting in part 
these developments, conditions in the primary residential mortgage market improved.  
The interest rate on 30-year fixed-rate conforming mortgages declined, on net, about 100 basis points to about 5.5 percent, prompting a notable increase in mortgage 
refinancing. 
(15) To address the tightening of credit conditions for consumers and small 
businesses, the Federal Reserve also announ ced on November 25 the creation of the 
TALF to support the markets for ABS colla teralized by student loans, auto loans, 
credit card loans, and loans guaranteed by  the Small Business Administration (SBA).
4  
The facility is expected to be operational by February of next year, and discussions 
with market participants about operational de tails of this facility are ongoing.     
(16) In the municipal bond market, issu ance of longer-term municipal bonds 
continued to rebound in November from the low levels of the past couple of months 
even as yield ratios relative to Treasuri es continued to surge.  Anecdotal reports 
suggest that the upward moves in yields may owe in part to supply pressures as states 
and localities seek to refinance their vari able-rate demand notes through the issuance 
of long-term debt.  The credit quality of municipal bonds deteriorated further, on net, 
over the period, likely placing fu rther upward pressure on yields. 
                                           
4 Under this program, the Federal Reserve will lend up to $200 billion on a non-recourse 
basis to holders of certain AAA-rated ABS backed by newly and recently originated 
consumer and small business loans.  Using fund s from the TARP program, the Treasury will 
provide $20 billion of credit prot ection in connection with the TALF.

Foreign Developments 
(17) Foreign financial markets continued to fluctuate amid mounting concerns 
about the ongoing global recession, but movements in equity prices and exchange 
rates moderated somewhat relative to deve lopments over the preceding few months.  
Faced with clear evidence of a slowdown in ac tivity and a rapid waning of inflationary 
pressures, central banks around the world ea sed policy sharply.  The Bank of England 
lowered its base rate by a total of 250 ba sis points, the European Central Bank by 125 
basis points, and the Swiss National Bank by a total of 200 basis points.  The Bank of 
Japan reduced its target for the overnight call rate by 20 basis points, to 30 basis 
points.  A number of central banks in em erging market economies also eased policy, 
most prominently the People’s Bank of Chin a, which cut its main policy rate from 
6.93 percent to 5.58 percent in two separate moves and also lowered reserve 
requirements.  The announcement on October 29  of new reciprocal swap lines with 
Brazil, Korea, Mexico, and Singapore was well received; since that time, Korea has 
made two drawings. (18) Reflecting prospects for lower infl ation and accommodative monetary 
policy for an extended period, ten-year nominal sovereign bond yields, which had 
been relatively little changed over the pr evious intermeeting period, dropped sharply 
in foreign industrial economies, as they did in  the United States (Chart 5).  Equity 
indexes in the foreign industrial economies,  which suffered very large drops in the 
previous period, were mixed,  declining in many euro area economies and Canada but 
rising in Japan and the United Kingdom.  Equity indexes rose in most emerging 
markets, in many cases registering double-dig it percent increases.  Sovereign credit 
spreads were volatile and remained elevated over the past month. 
(19) The major currencies index of the dolla r moved down nearly 2 percent, on 
net, since the October FOMC meeting.  Gains against some currencies—especially a 
9 percent rise against sterling—were more than  offset by declines against the euro and

partners over the period, despite large gains against the Brazilian real.  The dollar was 
little changed on net against the renminbi; an unusual downtick in the value of the 
renminbi late in the period, however, spurred concerns that the Chinese government 
may be planning to guide the cu rrency lower to help boost exports. 
Debt and Money 
(20) The debt of the domestic nonfinancial sectors is estimated to have 
expanded at about a 7¼ percent annual rate in the third quarter, somewhat slower 
than reported in the previous Bluebook, but still notably faster than the pace seen earlier this year (Chart 6).  The strength in  overall debt growth owes to a surge in 
borrowing by the federal government re lated to the Supplementary Financing 
Program and the TARP.  In the nonfinancial business sector, borrowing slowed in the 
third quarter from its pace earlier in the year.  After a sharp increase during the period of severe financial turmoil in October, wh en businesses reportedly drew down back-
up lines of credit at banks, borrowing a ppears to have fallen back in November.  
Household debt is now estimated to have contracted in the third quarter, reflecting a likely reduction in home mortgages amid contin uing declines in house prices.      
(21) Commercial bank credit exhibited broad weakness in November.  
Commercial and industrial (C&I) loans declined slightly in November following a surge in October.  According to the Nove mber Survey of Terms of Business Lending, 
the average spread on C&I loans—adjusted for changes in nonprice loan terms—increased 25 basis points to its highest le vel since early 2004, and spreads on higher-
risk loans that were not made under previous commitment increased sharply.  Growth in consumer loans also tailed off in November, and residential real estate loans continued to decline.  Moreover, loans drawn under home equity lines of credit, 
which had expanded briskly since mid-2007, slowed last month.  Banks have reported

tightening lending standards in the Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey for some 
time.  The tightening of lending standard s no doubt contributed to the 6 percent drop 
(at an annual rate) in the amount of total lending commitments--the sum of total 
outstanding loans and unused commitments--in the third quarter, which represents 
the largest decrease in that series sin ce the data on unused commitments became 
available in the second quarter of 1990. (22) M2 expanded at an 8½ percent annual rate in November, a significant 
slowdown from the pace of the previous month.  Retail money funds contracted 
somewhat after a surge in October that refl ected safe-haven inflows to Treasury-only 
funds.  The growth of small time deposits slowed somewhat, although their rate of 
expansion remained quite rapid as banks co ntinued to bid aggressively for these 
deposits.  Liquid deposits showed a modera te expansion in November.  Flows into 
demand deposits, which are covered by the FDIC’s new Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program, were significant and a pparently reflected shifts out of savings 
accounts as well as a redirection of fu nds by banks’ customers away from other 
money market instruments, given their extrem ely low interest rates.  Currency growth 
remained strong, likely because of cont inued solid foreign demand for U.S. 
banknotes.

Economic Outlook 
(23) The staff has again revised down sharply its outlook for economic activity.  
Conditions in the labor market have deteriorated more steeply than previously 
thought, the decline in industrial producti on has intensified, consumer and business 
spending have dropped further, and financia l conditions, on balan ce, appear to have 
tightened again.  As a consequence, the st aff forecast now assumes that the federal 
funds rate target will be lowered to ½ perc ent at this meeting and to ¼ percent early 
next year, where it stays for the remainder of  the forecast period.  Long-term Treasury 
yields drift up over the forecast horizon from a level that is more than a percentage 
point lower than in October, as the heavy demand for safe assets moderates when 
economic activity begins to improve later next year, and as the ten-year window for 
the Treasury yield extends further beyond th e period of very low short-term interest 
rates anticipated for the next few years.  Corporate bond yields decline over the 
forecast period, as economic conditions even tually improve and risk aversion abates.  
Mortgage rates, which declined a bit less th an Treasury yields over the intermeeting 
period, drop further to about 5 percent—near ly a percentage point lower than in the 
October forecast.  Equity prices rise at an annual rate of about 12 percent from a level 
that is approximately 9 percent lower than in  October.  The foreign exchange value of 
the dollar is flat in 2009 and declines about 3 percent in 2010.  Oil prices, which have 
dropped about $29 per barrel over the interm eeting period, rise in line with futures 
quotes to around $65 by the end of 2010, a le vel $20 per barrel lower than in October.  
The staff forecast also assumes that a large fiscal stimulus package, amounting to about $500 billion, is approved by the Congress early in 2009.   
(24) Against this backdrop, real GDP is exp ected to fall at an annual rate of 
4¾ percent in the current quarter and 3 percent in the first half of 2009, 3½ and 
2 percentage points more, respectively, than in the previous projection.  Over the 
remainder of 2009 and in 2010, the economy is  forecast to recover slowly.  Amid the 
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)
24 of 60
   
weaker outlook for GDP growth, the unemployment rate is anticipated to rise to 
8¼ percent in 2010, almost 1 percentage po int above the level in the October forecast 
and 3½ percentage points above the staff’ s estimate of the NAIRU.  Increased slack 
in resource utilization, diminished pressures from energy and materials prices, a decline in import prices, and some reduction in inflation expectations lead to a further projected moderation in core PCE inflation from 2 percent this year to 1 percent in 
2009 and ¾ percent in 2010.  Overall PCE inflation is projected at ¾ percent in 2009 
and 1 percent in 2010. 
Monetary Policy Strategies  
(25) As indicated in Chart 7, the Greenbook-consistent measure of short-run r* 
now stands at -3½  percent, about 30 ba sis points lower than in the October 
Bluebook.  The further decline in r* over the intermeeting pe riod primarily reflects the 
continued decline in equity prices and the widening of credit spreads, as well as the 
weakness of incoming data on the labor  market, motor vehicle sales, consumer 
spending, industrial production, and busi ness sentiment.  Financial and economic 
developments also explain an extremely steep drop in the estimate of short-run r* 
obtained from the small structural model.  This measure has moved down about 3¾  
percentage points since the last  Bluebook to about -6¾ percent.5  The estimate of 
short-run r* from the FRB/US model has fallen 1 percentage point since the previous 
Bluebook and is now around -6¼  perc ent.  The estimates of short-run r* span a wide 
interval, but all except the single-equation es timate are well below the current level of 
the actual real federal funds rate. 
                                           
5 To a lesser extent, the shift in the r* from the small structural model also reflects the 
revision in the current level of the output gap.

(26) Chart 8 depicts optimal control simula tions of the FRB/US model using the 
long-run staff forecast.6  In these simulations it is assumed that, in view of potential 
adverse effects of very low interest rates on financial markets and institutions, the 
Committee would not wish to lower the targ et federal funds rate below 25 basis 
points.7  For an inflation goal of either 1½ percent or 2 percent (the left-hand and 
right-hand sets of charts, respectively), the optimal control simulations prescribe a 
trajectory for the nominal federal funds rate  that hits the lower bound early in 2009 
and remains there through 2013, before tightening shortly thereafter.  Absent a lower 
bound to short-term nominal interest rate s, the optimal policy would have required a 
much larger reduction in the nominal federal funds rate, on the order of 5 percentage points in 2009.  Under either inflation goal , the unemployment rate is significantly 
higher for the next few years than in the October Bluebook, rising above 8 percent at 
the end of 2009 and remaining above the NAIRU through 2012; the path of core 
inflation is 40 to 80 basis points lower th an in the October Bluebook, staying below 1 
percent from 2010 onwards, reflecting the much  weaker current and projected state of 
aggregate demand, as well as recent declines  in prices of oil and other commodities.  
These optimal control simulations illust rate how the zero lower bound limits 
conventional monetary policy:  With inflat ion falling rapidly while the nominal federal 
funds rate is constrained to a level close to  zero, the real interest rates increase, and 
the corresponding tightening exacerbates we akness in activity and the rise in 
unemployment.  The Bluebook box, “Implica tions of Nonconventional Policies for 
Optimal Monetary Policy,” provides an illustration of how nonstandard policy actions could alter the optimal policy path.  
                                           
6 In these simulations, policymakers place equa l weight on keeping core PCE inflation close 
to a specified goal, on keepin g unemployment close to the NA IRU, and on avoiding changes 
in the nominal funds rate.  
7 This assumption differs from the one in the previous Bluebook where the lower bound 
was set equal to zero. These simulations assume that the actual federal funds rate trades at 
the target level chosen by the Committee.

 Implications of Unconventional Po licies for Optimal Monetary Policy 
 
 
 
1 Note 21 in the materials on the zero bound that were  sent to the Committee on December 5 (“Gauging the Macro 
Stimulus from Monetary Policy Communications and Othe r Tools”) provides a quantitative assessment of 
unconventional measures, including the effects of fiscal policy actions.  Given the severe deteriorat ion in the economic outlook 
since the last Bluebook, the optimal control simulations  
presented in the current Bluebook show the federal funds  
rate falling to its lower bound  early next year and remaining 
there beyond 2012.  These si mulations presume that the  
channels of the monetary transmission mechanism are  
operating normally; but, as the solid lines in the figures  
illustrate, the lower bound imposes a considerable  
constraint on the ability of the optimal policy to provide  
enough stimulus to generate a robust recovery with  
a relatively quick return of inflation and unemployment  
to desired levels.   
This baseline policy exercise assumes that the Federal  
Reserve does not undertake unconventional policies  
beyond those already incorporated in the Greenbook  
forecast.  However, the exercise can be revised to take  
account of the estimated e ffects of a variety of  
unconventional monetary policy tools, including  quantitative easing, targeted purchases of specific  
securities, and communication strategies aimed at  
influencing policy expectations.  Combining conventional 
optimal policy adjustments wi th these nontraditional policy 
responses should yield better outcomes for activity and  inflation.
1 
To illustrate such a possibility,  the dashed red lines in the 
Figures show the effects on th e optimal policy path and  
Economic   outcomes of assuming that the Federal Reserve 
engages   in more sustained nontraditional policy actions.  
In this particular simulation,  it is assumed that the  
implementation of such a polic y package would lower the  
level of nominal long-term interest rates —including  
Treasury rates, mortgage rates, and corporate bond rates— 
by about 100 basis points from 2009 to 2012, and 50 basis  
points  in 2013, relative to what  would occur under conventional  
optimal policy.

 Implications of Unconventional Polici es for Optimal Monetary Policy (Cont.) 
 
 
 The reduction in long-term rates boosts aggregate spending directly; it also provides further 
indirect stimulus through higher corporate equi ty prices and a lower foreign exchange value  
of the dollar.  In response, the unemployment  rate runs ¼ to ½ pe rcentage point below  
its path under conventional policy, and inflation does not fall quite as much.  These more 
favorable macroeconomic conditions, in turn, allow optimal monetary policy to begin to 
tighten at the end of 2012.  
The economic effects of this particular exampl e of unconventional policies are modest, but 
the estimates are subject to considerable uncerta inty.  First, it is possible that aggressive 
actions could, by easing investor concerns a bout the outlook, lower long-term private interest 
rates by even more than 100 basis points, although the degree of substitutability across 
Treasury and private securities is uncertain and smaller effects are also possible.  Second, these 
results are based on a model in which only financial variables respond directly to 
announcements about future policies; larger st imulative effects might be obtained if the 
expectations influencing spending decisions and wage-price setting, and not just those 
influencing financial markets, also responded fu lly to the implications  of the nontraditional 
policy actions for future economic conditions.  Third, more pronounced results might be possible if the nontraditional policy actions we re paired with a major fiscal stimulus.

(27) As depicted in Chart 9, the outcome- based policy rule prescribes a funds 
rate that drops to the 25-basis-point lower bound by 2009Q1 and stays there through 
2011 before steadily rising to about 3½ perc ent by the end of 2013.  The trajectory of 
the funds rate consistent with financial ma rket quotes declines to below 0.50 percent 
during the first half of 2009 before rising to  a plateau of about 2¼ percent starting in 
2011. 8  In contrast to FRB/US simulations with the outcome-based rule, information 
from financial markets indicates that investor s see a relatively high likelihood of policy 
tightening by the end of 2009.9  As shown in the bottom panel of Chart 9, the near-
term prescriptions from both the 1993 and 1999 versions of the Taylor rules are 
significantly lower than those shown in th e previous Bluebook, reflecting the weaker 
path for output and lower projected levels  of inflation.  Th e 1993 Taylor rule 
prescribes setting the funds rate about 1½ percentage point lower than in October; 
both the first-difference rule and the 1999 Ta ylor rule prescribe setting the funds rate 
at its lower bound.  The near-term prescripti ons from the 1993 Taylor  rule are slightly 
higher than for the other rules because th e 1999 Taylor rule and the first difference 
rule are a bit more sensitive to the output gap.  
                                           
8 The probability of low interest rates may be underestimated because the confidence 
intervals shown in the top right panel of Chart 9 are computed from interest rate caps with 
strike prices between 1 percent and 14 percent.  Interest rate caps with a strike price below 1 
percent are not currently traded.  
9 As noted earlier, given the uncertainty abou t the economic and financial outlook, reading 
policy expectations from federal funds future s and options is not straightforward.  In 
particular, the term premium may be larger than  usual, which would imply that investors are 
expecting less policy tightening than what it is shown in Chart 9 (see box “Expected 
Softness in the Expected Federal Funds Rate”).

Policy Alternatives 
(28) This Bluebook presents four alternativ es for the Committee’s consideration, 
summarized by the draft statements on the following pages.  In view of the sharp 
deterioration in the economic outlook, th e proximity of the zero lower bound on 
nominal interest rates, and the unconvention al policy actions that have already been 
announced, the content and structure of the proposed alternatives differ substantially 
from previous Bluebooks.  Under Alternat ive A, the Committee decides not to set a 
target for the federal funds rate, states that it anticipates that weak economic 
conditions are likely to warrant funds rates near zero for some time, and makes clear 
that its main policy tool going forward will  be actions that make use of the Federal 
Reserve’s balance sheet.  Under Alternative B, the Committee instead announces a target range for the federal funds rate of 0 to  ¼ percent and states that it will use all 
available tools to promote the resumption of sustainable economic growth and price 
stability.  Under Alternative C, the target rate is cut 50 basis points to ½ percent and 
the possibility of a further downward adjustment, should conditions warrant, is left open.  Under Alternative D, the federal funds rate target is left unchanged at 1 percent under the view that recent policy actions should help promote acceptable 
economic growth over time; as in Alternativ e C, the possibility of future policy easing 
is left open.  In view of the large amounts  of reserves being provided by the Federal 
Reserve’s various liquidity facilities, Alternat ives C and D recognize that federal funds 
may trade below the target rate for at le ast some time.  All four alternatives 
acknowledge that economic activity appear s to have slowed further since the last 
FOMC meeting.  Alternatives A, B, and C note that the Committee expects inflation 
to moderate in coming months and even sees some risk that inflation could drop 
below levels consistent with price stability; Alternative D uses the same language on inflation as the October statement.  To make clear that adjusting th e funds rate is not 
the Federal Reserve’s only polic y tool in a world of very low interest rates, all four

October FOMC Statement 
1.  The Federal Open Market Comm
ittee decided today to lower its target for the federal 
funds rate 50 basis points to 1 percent.   
 
 
  
 
 
 2.  The pace of economic activity appears to have slowed markedly, owing importantly to 
a decline in consumer expenditures. Bu siness equipment spending and industrial 
production have weakened in recent months , and slowing economic activity in many 
foreign economies is damping the pros pects for U.S. exports. Moreover, the 
intensification of financial market turmoil is likely to exert additional restraint on 
spending, partly by further reducing the abil ity of households and businesses to obtain 
credit.  
3.  In light of the declines in the prices of energy and other commodities and the weaker 
prospects for economic activity, the Committee expects inflation to moderate in coming 
quarters to levels consiste nt with price stability. 
4.  Recent policy actions, including today’s rate  reduction, coordinated interest rate cuts 
by central banks, extraordinary liquidity meas ures, and official steps to strengthen 
financial systems, should help over time to improve credit conditions and promote a 
return to moderate economic growth. Nevertheless, downside risks to growth remain. The Committee will monitor economic and financial developments carefully and will act as 
needed to promote sustainable ec onomic growth and price stability.

 Alternative A 
1.  Since the Committee’s last meeting, labor market conditions have deteriorated, and 
the available data indicate that consumer  spending, business investment, and industrial 
production have declined.  Overall, the outlook for economic ac tivity has weakened 
further. 
2.  Meanwhile, inflationary pressures have dimi nished quickly.  In light  of the declines in 
the prices of energy and other commodities  and the weaker prospects for economic 
activity, the Committee expects inflation to m oderate in coming quarters and sees some 
risk that inflation could decline for a time be low rates that best foster economic growth 
and price stability in the longer term.  [In support of its dual mandate, the Committee will 
seek to achieve a rate of inflation, as measured by the price index for personal 
consumption expenditures, of about 2 percent in the medium term.] 
3.  In current circumstances, the Committee judged  that it was not useful to set a specific 
target for the federal funds rate.  As a resu lt of the large volume of reserves provided by 
the Federal Reserve’s various liq uidity facilities, th e federal funds rate has declined to 
very low levels, and the Committee anticipates  that weak economic conditions are likely 
to warrant federal funds rates near zero for some time.   4.  The focus of policy going forward will be  to continue to support the functioning of 
financial markets and stimulate the economy through open market operations and other 
measures that entail the use of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet.  In particular, as 
previously announced, over the next few quart ers the Federal Reserve will purchase large 
quantities of agency debt and mortgage-back ed securities to provide support to the 
mortgage and housing markets, a nd it stands ready to expand its  purchases of agency debt 
and mortgage-backed securities as conditions warrant.  The Committee is also evaluating 
the potential benefits of purch asing longer-term Treasury securities.  Early next year, the 
Federal Reserve will also implement the Term  Asset-Backed Securitie s Loan Facility to 
facilitate the extension of credit to households and small businesses.  The Federal 
Reserve will continue to actively consider wa ys of using its balance sheet to further 
support credit markets and economic activity. 
5.  In related actions, the Board of Governor s today approved a 75 basis point decrease in 
the primary credit rate to 1/ 2 percent and establis hed interest rates on required and excess 
reserve balances of 1/4 per cent.  In approving the reduction in the discount rate, the 
Board acted on requests submitted by the Federal Reserve Banks of . . .

 Alternative B 
1.  The Federal Open Market Committee decide d today to establish a target range for the 
federal funds rate of 0 to 1/4 percent.   
2.  Since the Committee’s last meeting, labor market conditions have deteriorated, and 
the available data indicate that consumer  spending, business investment, and industrial

further. 
3.  Meanwhile, inflationary pressures have dimi nished quickly.  In light  of the declines in 
the prices of energy and other commodities  and the weaker prospects for economic 
activity, the Committee expects inflation to m oderate in coming quarters and sees some 
risk that inflation could decline for a time be low rates that best foster economic growth 
and price stability in the longer term. 4.  The Federal Reserve will employ all available tools to promote the resumption of 
sustainable economic growth and to  preserve price stability.   In particular, as previously 
announced, over the next few quarters the Fede ral Reserve will purchase large quantities 
of agency debt and mortgage-backed securities to provide support to the mortgage and 
housing markets, and it stands ready to expand its purchases of agency debt and mortgage-backed securities and as conditions warrant.  The Committee is also evaluating 
the potential benefits of purch asing longer-term Treasury securities.  Early next year, the 
Federal Reserve will also implement the Term  Asset-Backed Securitie s Loan Facility to 
facilitate the extension of credit to households and small businesses.  The Federal Reserve continues to consider possible addi tions to and expansions of its liquidity 
facilities, as well as other means of using its balance sheet to fu rther support credit 
markets and economic activity. 
5.  In a related action, the Board of Gove rnors unanimously approved a 75-basis-point 
decrease in the discount rate to 1/2 percent. In taking this  action, the Board approved the 
requests submitted by the Boards of Directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of . . .  The 
Board also established interest rates on required and excess reserve balances of 1/4 percent.

 Alternative C 
1.  The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to lower its target for the federal 
funds rate 50 basis points to ½ percent.   
2.  Reflecting in part the intensification of th e financial strains earlier in the fall, the pace 
of economic activity ha s slowed further and the near-t erm outlook has worsened.  Labor 
market conditions have continued to dete riorate, and consumer spending, business 
investment, and industrial production have declined.  3.  In light of the declines in the prices of energy and other commodities and the weaker 
prospects for economic activity, the Committee expects inflation to moderate in coming 
quarters and sees some risk that inflation could decline for a time below rates that best foster economic growth and pric e stability in the longer term. 
4.  In these circumstances, the Committee’s pr imary concern is the downside risks to the 
economy.  The Committee will monitor economic and financial developments carefully and will use all available tools to promote th e resumption of sustainable economic growth 
and to preserve price stability.   
5.  In particular, as previously announced, over the next few quarter s the Federal Reserve 
will purchase large quantities of agency debt and mortgage-backed securities to provide 
support to the mortgage and housing markets, a nd it stands ready to expand its purchases 
of agency debt and mortgage-backed securiti es as conditions warrant.  The Committee is 
also evaluating the potential be nefits of purchasing longer- term Treasury securities.  
Early next year, the Federal Reserve will im plement the Term Asset-Backed Securities

Federal Reserve continues to consider possible additions to and expans ions of its liquidity

markets and economic activity. 
6.  In a related action, the Board of Gove rnors unanimously approved a 50-basis-point 
decrease in the discount rate to 1/2 percent. In taking this  action, the Board approved the 
requests submitted by the Boards of Directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of . . .     7. In view of the large volume of reserves  provided by the Federal Reserve’s various

average somewhat below the ½ percent target.

   Alternative D 
1.  The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target for the federal funds rate at 1 percent.   
2.  Reflecting in part the intensification of the financial strains earlier in the fall, the pace 
of economic activity appears to have slowed further, and the near-term outlook for growth has deteriorated.  Moreover, the downs ide risks are significant.  However, policy 
actions taken in recent months, including reducti ons in short-term interest rates to very 
low levels, extraordinary liquidity measures, a nd official steps to strengthen the financial 
system, should help over time to improve cr edit conditions and promote a return to 
moderate economic growth.  As announced prev iously, the Federal Reserve will purchase 
a large volume of agency debt and mortgage -backed securities to provide support to the 
mortgage and housing markets and thus to br oader economic activity.  Early next year, 
the Federal Reserve will also implement the Te rm Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility 
to help facilitate the extension of cr edit to households and small businesses. 
3.  In light of the declines in the prices of energy and other commodities and the weaker prospects for economic activity, the Committee expects inflation to moderate in coming 
quarters to levels consiste nt with price stability. 
4.  In view of the large volume of reserv es provided by the Federal Reserve’s various 
liquidity facilities, the Comm ittee recognizes that the federa l funds rate is likely to 
average significantly below the target rate  for some time.  The Committee will monitor 
economic and financial developments carefully in light of recent pol icy actions and will 
act as needed to promote sustainabl e economic growth and price stability.

alternatives point to the recent announcemen ts that the Federal Reserve will purchase 
large volumes of agency debt and mortgage-b acked securities and will implement the 
Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility  (TALF).  Alternatives A, B, and C also 
explicitly refer to the possibility of further using the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet to 
support financial markets and economic activi ty, including by purchasing Treasury 
securities.   
(29)   If the Committee agrees that th e economic outlook has deteriorated 
significantly since the October meeting and th inks that
 substantial monetary stimulus 
will be needed to support a recovery in economic activity, it may be inclined to favor 
Alternative A  or Alternative B .  Members may be disappointed by a forecast, such as 
the one presented in this Greenbook, in wh ich economic activity contracts severely 
this quarter and in the first half of next ye ar and recovers only slowly after that, even 
with a federal funds rate at 25 basis point s through 2010 and with substantial fiscal 
stimulus.  Accordingly, Committee members may  feel that even stronger policy action 
than what is assumed in the Greenbook will  be necessary to promote a return to 
sustainable economic growth.  Regarding th e outlook for inflation, the Committee 
may be concerned that the projected sharp contraction in economic activity, coupled with the striking ongoing de cline in the prices of energy and other commodities, may 
cause inflation to fall to an uncomfortably low level, perhaps even lower than 
projected in the staff forecast (as in the “L ower Inflation” alternative scenario in the 
Greenbook).  In these circumstances, Commi ttee members may thus wish to take a 
bold action at this meeting to counter the risk of deflation, and they may also want to presage further expansions of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet. 
(30) Against this backdrop, the Committee may decide not to announce a target 
for the federal funds rate at this meeting and signal instead that its focus has shifted to the use of the Federal Reserve’s balance shee t as an especially important policy tool 
going forward, as in Alternative A.  The Federal Reserve’s balance sheet has already 
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)
39 of 60
   
expanded considerably in recent months and will continue to expand in the immediate 
future as the Federal Reserve begins to purchase agency debt and mortgage-backed 
securities in volume, as already announced , and as the TALF becomes operational.  
Federal funds have often traded below 50  basis points since the October meeting 
even with the current target of 1 percent.  In the last week, wi th the anticipation of 
further policy easing at this meeting, fede ral funds have traded persistently below 
10 basis points.  Members may thus view a sh ift away from interest rate targeting and 
towards balance sheet management as essentially already under way.  Committee 
members may also be mindful that announcing a target that is not possible to achieve 
may create the impression that Federal Rese rve policy is ineffect ive, even though 
powerful tools remain at the Committee’s di sposal to address the deteriorating 
economic and financial situation.   (31) One such tool is communication.  As incorporated in the third paragraph of 
Alternative A, the Committee could explicitly state that it anticipates that short-term 
interest rates will remain low for some time.   Members may be reluctant to enter into 
an unconditional commitment because they may feel that such a commitment would 
be too constraining should they need to tighten policy sooner than now expected.  To 
mitigate this concern, the Committee co uld phrase the commitment in implicitly 
conditional terms by indicating its antici pation that “weak economic conditions are 
likely to warrant federal funds rates near ze ro for some time,” as suggested in the 
statement accompanying Alternative A.
10  In addition, if members were concerned 
that even increased use of the Federal Rese rve’s balance sheet as a policy tool and a 
                                           
10 The Committee may feel that a commitment that is conditioned on too precise a set of 
events may also be undesirable because, in th e future, a need to tighten policy may arise well 
before those specific events materialize.  Th e proposed sentence makes clear in broad terms 
that the commitment is not unconditional (becaus e the expectation of very low rates is based 
on “weak economic conditions”), but at the same time the condition is cast in terms broad 
enough that it likely will not constrain the Comm ittee’s future decisions.  The length of the 
commitment (“for some time”) is described in  similarly broad terms for the same reason. 
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)
40 of 60
   
commitment to keep interest rates low for some time might not be sufficient to 
counter deflationary pressures, the Committee could explicitly state, as indicated in 
the bracketed sentence, that it will seek to achieve a rate of inflation of about 
2 percent in the medium term, in order to  buoy inflation expectations.  Higher 
inflation expectations, in turn, would redu ce real interest rates and so support 
economic activity. 
(32) The statement suggested for Alternative A begins by acknowledging the 
further weakening of the outlook for econom ic activity rather than with a sentence 
about the federal funds rate.  This departure from the standard structure of the FOMC statement is intended both to emphasize that the focus of the Committee has shifted away from the target federal funds rate and to provide a clear rationale for that 
shift.  The second paragraph notes the we akening of inflationary pressures and the 
risk that inflation could decline for a ti me below rates that best foster economic 
growth and price stability.  As noted above, members may wish to conclude that 
paragraph with the sentence, “In support of its dual mandate, the Committee will seek 
to achieve a rate of inflation, as measured  by the price index of personal consumption 
expenditures, of about 2 percent in the medi um term.”  By using the words “seek to 
achieve” and “in the medium term,” the Committee would acknowledge that it may 
not be possible to maintain inflation at the desired level over the specified period, but 
the statement would nonetheless signal the Committee’s policy objective.  If members were uncomfortable with taking such a step at this meeting, they could simply omit 
that sentence from the statement.  Th e third paragraph notes the Committee’s 
decision not to set a specific target for the federal funds rate, acknowledges that the 
federal funds rate has already declined to ve ry low levels, and states the expectations 
that federal funds rate will remain near zero  for some time.  The statement goes on in 
paragraph 4 to indicate a shift of the Committ ee’s focus from the target rate to the use 
of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet.  That  paragraph repeats a number of measures 
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)
41 of 60
   
that have already been announced but not (or only partially) implemented, thereby 
emphasizing that a number of unconvention al policy actions are already forthcoming, 
and foreshadows the possibility that the Fe deral Reserve will purchase longer-term 
Treasury securities if conditions warrant.  The intention to continue to actively 
consider policies that employ the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet is also explicitly stated in order to clarify that other tools could also be used if needed to support credit markets and economic activity.   
(33) While expectations of next week’s policy action are difficult to discern from 
market quotes because of the continued exp ected softness in the federal funds rate, 
the Desk’s survey suggests that most primar y dealers see a 50 basis point reduction in 
the target federal funds rate as the most likely outcome of the December meeting, and 
that a majority sees ½ percent as the trough fo r the target federal funds rate this cycle.  
As a result, a decision to move away from interest rate targeting and to let federal 
funds fluctuate somewhere in the vicinity of the zero bound will likely surprise 
investors.  Short-term interest rates w ill decline, but probably not by much, 
considering that they are alre ady very low and that federal funds are already trading at 
rates well below ¼ percent.  Stock prices may rise if investors read the decision to 
move away from targeting the level of th e federal funds rate and concentrate on use 
of the balance sheet as underscoring the Federal Reserve’s determination to promote 
a rapid return to sustainable economic grow th.  The foreign exchange value of the 
dollar will likely decline somewhat.  Judging from the Desk’s survey, some market 
participants may be surprised by the re ference to unconventional policies in the 
statement.  And the indication that the fede ral funds rate could remain near zero for 
some time could lead investors to mark do wn their expected path for policy in 2009 
and beyond.  As a result of these influences, longer-term interest rates should move lower, although the size of that declin e may be muted because the purchases of 
agency and mortgage-backed securities have already been announced and the 
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)

Chairman raised the possibility of purchases of  large quantities of Treasury securities 
in a recent speech. 
(34) If the Committee shares the staff view that the economic outlook has 
deteriorated markedly and thinks that, gi ven the circumstances, moving the federal 
funds rate near the zero bound on nominal in terest rates is desirable, but it wants to 
continue to provide an explicit target for the federal funds rate, then it might choose 
to establish a target range of 0 to ¼ percent as in Alternative B .  Continuing to set a 
target that encompasses very low federa l funds rates would not compromise the 
Committee’s ability to resort to unconventi onal policy measures.  In addition, some 
members may be concerned that switching to  the use of the Federal Reserve’s balance 
sheet as its main policy tool could delay a return to a more conventional monetary 
policy based on interest rate targeting beca use some unconventional policy measures 
(such as the purchases of long-term assets ) may not be easy or cheap to unwind 
quickly.  Consequently, members may feel th at maintaining a target range, however 
low, could be desirable because it may mak e a return to more traditional monetary 
policy simpler and more straightforward once economic and financial conditions improve.  In addition, Committee member s may see the maintenance of a federal 
funds target as advantageous from a governance perspective, since the determination of the target rate is a prerogative of the Committee, whereas the Committee and the 
Board both have separate authorities that ca n be used to affect the composition and 
size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet. 
(35) Achieving exactly a zero effective fede ral funds rate may be impossible since 
there would be no incentive for depositor y institutions to sell funds without 
compensation.  It may even be undesirable, given the strains that it could put on some 
financial institutions and financial markets.  On the other hand, members may feel that the direct monetary stimulus obtained by  bringing the target rate to a very low 
but positive level, along with the increa sed flexibility thereby provided to use 
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)
43 of 60
   
nonconventional policy actions, outweighs the a ssociated costs.  As in Alternative A, 
the Committee may also be concerned that the sharp contraction in economic activity 
and the steep declines in the prices of energy and other commodities may cause 
inflation to fall to an uncomfortably low le vel.  In such circumstances, conditional on 
their desire to maintain a federal funds ra te target, Committee members may prefer to 
make that target as low as possible immedi ately, rather than making a more gradual 
adjustment, to counter the risk of further severe deterioration in economic and financial conditions.   
(36) The rationale section of the statement under Alternative B begins by noting 
the recent deterioration in economic cond itions and in the outlook for economic 
activity.  The statement is also explicit as to the reduction in inflationary pressures and 
notes the risks that inflation could decline for a time below levels that best foster 
economic growth and price stability in the longer term.  The fourth paragraph makes 
clear the intention to use all tools at the Committee’s disposal to promote the 
resumption of sustainable economic growth and to preserve price stability.  Some of 
these tools—the already announced purchases of agency debt and mortgage-backed 
securities, the possible expansion of those purchases, the possibility of beginning to 
purchase longer-term Treasury securitie s, the implementation of the TALF, and the 
possible expansion of other types of liquid ity provision and other means of using the 
Federal Reserve’s balance sheet—are also noted.     (37) Given that most market participants a ppear to expect only a 50 basis point 
reduction in the target at this meeting, a decision to reduce it instead by at least 
75 basis points will come as surprise, but likely not a large one since some investors 
apparently anticipate that the target will be brought down to ¼ percent at the January 
meeting.  As a result, nominal interest rates would likely decline a little, stock prices may increase some, and the foreign exch ange value of the dollar may decline 
modestly.  As in Alternative B, market pa rticipants may also be surprised by the 
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)
44 of 60
   
reference to unconventional policy measur es, and medium- and long-term Treasury 
yields might edge lower.  
(38) The Committee may prefer Alternative C  for a number of reasons.  
Members may feel that a subs tantial policy easing at this meeting is warranted in 
response to the sharp deterioration of the economic outlook in recent weeks.  A 50 basis point cut in the target rate at this meeting may be seen as appropriate, 
considering that policy has been  eased substantially over the last year, that a number 
of extraordinary liquidity measures have been put in place or are in train, and that mortgage rates have already dropped appreci ably in light of the Federal Reserve’s 
recently announced program to purchase agency debt and mortgage-backed securities.  The Committee may wish to give the stimul us produced by the combination of all 
these policies a chance to show its effects, while at the same time leaving open the 
possibility of a further reduction in the ta rget rate and the implementation of more 
unconventional policy actions should macroeconomic conditions fail to improve.  A reduction in the target rate to ½ percent that is matched by a comparable reduction in 
the interest rate on excess reserves would lik ely cause federal funds to trade below the 
new target.  Even so, the Committee may still  want to set a targ et of ½ percent to 
signal where it would want federal funds to  trade once financial conditions begin to 
improve, some Federal Reserve programs  are unwound, and the amount of excess 
reserves in the system return s to a more normal level.   
(39) Alternatively, members may feel that quite forceful policy action is required 
to counter the sharp deterioration in the economic outlook but at the same time be 
unwilling to lower the target rate below 50 basis points.  Members’ reluctance to move to an extremely low target federal funds rate may stem from concerns about the 
potential for adverse consequences on variou s financial markets and institutions that 
such a move could engender.  Such a concer n may be reinforced by  the likelihood that 
federal funds will trade below the new target until improved financial conditions allow 
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)
45 of 60
   
a substantial reduction in excess reserves in  the financial system.  Members may also 
be worried that a very low target for th e federal funds rate may itself lead to 
undesirable increases in inflation expectations.  The Committee may thus view 
½ percent as a floor for the target federal funds rate and may wish to apply any 
further monetary stimulus exclusively through unconventional policies, such as 
purchases of agency and mortgage-backed securities or Treasury securities.  
(40) As a third motivation for favoring Alternative C, members may view a 
decision to reduce the target rate by 50 ba sis points as an intermediate step towards 
reaching a level of rates clos er to the zero bound at a later date.  Such an approach 
would be consistent with the staff’s assumption in the Greenbook projection, the 
prescriptions of a number of policy rules, and the optimal control simulations with an 
inflation target of either 1½ or 2 percent described in the monetary policy strategies 
section of this Bluebook.   Even if me mbers are not concerned that a sustained 
environment of very low interest rates will be particularly harmful to certain financial 
markets and institutions, they may still believ e that making the move toward the zero 
bound in two steps would be preferable on  the grounds that it would allow market 
participants more time to adjust to a world of near-zero interest rates.  In addition, the 
Committee may feel that such a gradual approa ch would not be overly costly in terms 
of its macroeconomic objectives since further monetary stimulus could be provided through additional unconventional policy measures.  Finally, an inclination to ease 
policy 50 basis points at this meeting might be  reinforced by the fact that most market 
participants appear to expect a 50 basi s point reduction in the target rate, and 
Committee members might be reluctant to in ject further uncertainty into financial 
markets at a time when markets remain extremely fragile. (41) The rationale section of the statemen t accompanying Alternative C begins 
by acknowledging that economic activity is contracting in the fourth quarter and by 
pointing to deterioration in labor market s, household and business spending, and 
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)
46 of 60
   
industrial production.  The paragraph on inflation reiterates, as in October, that the 
Committee expects inflation to moderate because of the weaker economic outlook 
and the decline in the prices of energy and other commodities, but also, as in 
Alternatives A and B, that there are risks that inflation will fall to rates below those 
that would best foster economic growth and price stability.  The next paragraph makes clear that downside risks to the economy are the Committee’s primary concern and indicates that the Committee “will use all its available tools to promote the 
resumption of economic growth and to pres erve price stability.”  This wording is 
intended to leave the door open to, but not promise, a further reduction in the target 
rate if conditions warrant, while at the s ame time making it clear that unconventional 
policy actions are also available.  Some of these actions, including the possibility that 
existing programs may be expanded or  new programs may be implemented if 
appropriate, are cited in the next paragra ph.  If the Committee viewed Alternative C 
as a stepping stone to an even lower target  federal funds rate, it may wish to add a 
sentence to signal more clearly to market pa rticipants that a further reduction in the 
target rate may be forthcoming.  For exam ple, the fourth paragraph of the statement 
could conclude by saying that, “The Co mmittee will consider whether further 
reductions in the target federal funds rate would be beneficial in light of evolving 
circumstances.”  On the other hand, if the Committee sees ½ percent as a floor below 
which it is not likely to push the target rate , it may also wish to make its thinking more 
explicit, for example by adding the clau se “Although the Committee believes that 
further reductions in the target federal fund s rate would not be beneficial on balance” 
immediately before the indication that the Committee will use all of its available tools 
(which in this case would be referred to as “all other available tools”).  The statement 
concludes with an acknowledgement that federal funds may trade below the target, 
given the large amounts of ex cess reserves in the system. 
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)
47 of 60
   
(42) Since most primary dealers see a 50 basis point policy easing as the most 
likely outcome at this meeting, and since a majority see ½ percent as the trough for 
the target federal funds rate this cycle, the market reaction to an announcement like 
that for Alternative C is likely to be mute d, with short-term interest rates, equity 
prices, and the foreign exchange value of  the dollar all changing little.  The 
movements in these variables may be a bit more pronounced if the Committee decided to be more explicit regarding its proclivity to move the target rate lower in the 
future because the uncertainty  as to the floor for the ta rget would be removed; any 
such move, however, is not likely to be ma jor, partly because market participants may 
expect federal funds to trade quite soft to the target in any case.  As in Alternative B,  
longer-term interest rates may decline a little, but probably not by much, because investors may be somewhat surprised by the language on the use of the Federal 
Reserve’s balance sheet as a means of further supporting credit markets and economic 
activity. (43) If the Committee’s view of the ec onomic outlook is appreciably more 
optimistic than the staff’s, and, in partic ular, if members believe that past policy 
actions, along with those announced but not yet implemented, will be sufficient to 
return the economy to a path of moderate economic growth before too long, the Committee may wish to leave the target ra te unchanged at this meeting as in 
Alternative D.  Committee members may have a so mewhat more upbeat outlook for 
2009 and 2010 that the staff and may believe, for example, that the recovery from the present recession, starting in the second half  of next year, will be more robust than 
anticipated by the staff, as in the “fas ter recovery” alternative scenario in the 
Greenbook.  In addition, the Committee ma y think that the policy actions taken 
recently not only by the Federal Reserve but also by other foreign central banks, the 
Congress, the Treasury, and the FDIC (includi ng the reduction in policy rates to very 
low levels, purchases of agency debt and mortgage-backed securities, extraordinary 
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)
48 of 60
   
liquidity measures, official steps to strengthen the financial system, and fiscal stimulus) 
should be given a chance to work, and that their combined effect could potentially be 
very large.  Indeed members may be mindfu l that the extent and timing of some of 
those policies, such as the fiscal packag e that will ultimately be passed by the 
Congress, is still unknown.  The fiscal pa ckage may well turn out to be larger, or 
implemented sooner, than currently assumed in  the staff forecast.  (The “bigger fiscal 
package” scenario in the Greenbook illustrates this possibility.)  Wi th that upside risk 
in mind, the Committee may want to pause at  least at this meeting and see whether 
the economy will show some si gns of recovery as these policies begin to take effect.  
The Committee may also anticipate that, alt hough federal funds are likely to continue 
to trade below target for a time because of the large amounts of excess reserves 
currently in the system, an unchanged federal funds rate target provides a better signal 
of its policy intentions.  The Committee may be lieve that, over time, existing liquidity 
facilities can be scaled back or eliminated, allowing the federal funds rate to converge 
back to its target level.  Alternatively, memb ers may feel that bringing the target to an 
unprecedented low level may increase uncertainty, further compromise market functioning, decrease confidence, perh aps boost inflation expectations, and so 
ultimately be counterproductive.  Members may  also want to preserve some room to 
lower the target rate at a later date in order to bolster confidence should further 
negative shocks hit the economy. (44) The rationale portion of the statement accompanying Alternative D 
acknowledges that the pace of economic acti vity appears to have slowed further and 
that the near-term outlook has deteriorated.  However, the statement notes that the 
Committee expects the recent policy measures  to improve credit conditions and 
promote a return to moderate growth over  time.  To underscore that the Federal 
Reserve has already taken concrete actions in response to the deterioration in the 
outlook, the remaining part of that paragr aph notes that the Federal Reserve will 
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)
49 of 60
   
purchase large amounts of agency and mort gage-backed securities and will implement 
the TALF early next year.  The language on inflation remains unchanged from the 
October meeting, and the last paragraph acknowledges, as in Alternative C, that 
federal funds may continue to trade below the target for some time.  The statement 
concludes by noting that the Committ ee will monitor economic and financial 
developments and will act as needed to  promote its statutory objectives.  That 
declaration, together with th e indication of downside risks to the outlook, would likely 
be seen as signaling that the Committee is ope n to further reduction in the target rate 
at upcoming meetings if conditions warrant. 
(45) Given current expectations, market participants would likely be extremely 
surprised if the Committee were to leave the target rate unchanged.  Short-term 
interest rates would probably back up somewh at, although the extent of the increase 
would likely be moderated by recognition that federal funds would continue to trade 
below target for some time.  Equity prices would drop, and the dollar would 
appreciate.  The absence of any reference to additional means of using the Federal 
Reserve balance sheet to improve credit an d liquidity conditions would likely induce 
investors to reconsider their views of the li kelihood of further purchases of assets by 
the Federal Reserve, and medium- and lo nger-term yields would probably move 
notably higher.  Overall, volatility and strains in financial markets would likely 
increase. 
Money and Debt Forecasts 
(46) The staff forecast for M2 has changed little since October.  After expanding 
at a 7½ percent rate this year, boosted by the decline in short-term rates and the 
associated drop in the opportunity cost of ho lding M2 assets, M2 growth is projected 
to slow to about 3 percent in 2009 as nom inal GDP growth falls and opportunity cost 
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)
50 of 60
   
begins to rise.  In 2010, M2 is anticipated to grow at roughly the same rate as in 2009 
and about in line with nominal GDP.   
(47) Amid sharply curtailed mortgage and consumer credit, household debt is 
expected to decline about 1 percent in 2009 and to rise just a little in 2010 as credit 
constraints ease only gradually.  Even though overall credit conditions are expected to 
ease over time, nonfinancial business debt wi ll likely expand at a weak pace next year 
and in 2010, as capital spending will remain sluggish.  Federal debt, which has surged 
in the second half of 2008 because of government programs aimed at addressing 
financial market strains, is anticipated to continue to grow at a rapid pace throughout the forecast period.  Overall, total domestic  nonfinancial debt is projected to expand 
4½ percent in 2009 and 4¼ percent in 2010.

Alternatives for the Directive 
(48) Federal funds have traded predominan tly around or below ½ percent since 
the October meeting even with a target rate  of 1 percent.  Given the provision of 
large amounts of excess reserves through the liquidity programs that the Federal 
Reserve has put in place in recent months, and with balance sheet constraints that 
prevent many depository institutions from  exploiting the arbitrage between low 
federal funds rates and higher interest ra tes on excess reserves, the funds rate has 
fallen well short of the target set by the Co mmittee, as discussed in more detail in the 
“Recent developments in the federal funds market” box.  As noted earlier, the 
proposed statement for Alternatives C and D acknowledge that the same will likely be 
true in the future, at least so long as the amount of excess reserves in the system 
remains elevated.  If the Committee wanted to maintain a target, potential steps to 
soak up excess reserves, short of drastically  reducing the size of existing liquidity 
facilities and currency swap agreements wi th foreign central banks—an option that 
the Committee presumably would find unappealing—include, in principle, financing existing and potential new liquidity faciliti es by issuing Federal Reserve bills or by 
expanding the Special Financing Program (S FP) and thus the size of the Treasury 
balance at the Federal Reserve.  Howe ver, the former measure would require 
authorization by the Congress, and the Treasury  is unlikely to take the latter step in 
the near term because of possible debt-ceiling constraints.  Indeed, concerns about the debt ceiling have led the Treasury to reduce over recent weeks the size of the SFP 
and the associated balances placed at the Federal Reserve.  A possible alternative 
would be for the Federal Reserve to offer depository institutions a term deposit facility in which they could place funds for fi xed periods of time and earn interest at a 
rate above that paid on excess reserves.  Ba lances placed under this facility would not 
count toward reserve requirements and could not be accessed before their maturity.  
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)
53 of 60
   
The staff has begun to develop plans for such a facility, but its likely effectiveness in 
putting upward pressure on the federal funds rate is unclear. 
(49) If the Committee wants to keep a target  for the federal funds rate of either 
½ percent as in Alternative C or 1 percent as in Alternative D, and agrees that the options available to drain reserves from the system and enable the Desk to meet the target are either unlikely to materialize or are likely to be otherwise undesirable, it may 
wish to change the wording of its directive to the Desk to recognize that it does not 
expect the target to be consistently met given the circumstances.  The Committee may 
wish to include in the directive a sentence sim ilar to that in the public statements that 
will accompany the policy decisions and explicit ly indicate that it recognizes that the 
federal funds rate may tend to trade below the new target.  If it were to choose 
Alternative C, the Committee may also wa nt to direct the Desk to purchase 
$100 billion in housing-related GSE debt and up to $500 billion in agency-guaranteed MBS, as already announced, and to do so by the end of the second quarter of next year to provide a more specific time frame than the “several quarters” indicated in the 
November 25 press release.  Such a direct ive is not included under Alternative D 
because if the Committee were optimistic enough about the outlook to select that 
alternative, it might not want the desk to  complete the full amount of the announced 
purchases.   
(50) Under Alternative B, the Committee would direct the Desk to seek 
conditions in reserve markets consistent with  federal funds trading in a range of 0 to 
¼ percent.  It may also want to direct the Desk to purchase GSE debt and agency-
guaranteed MBS over the next intermeetin g period, but to leave the Desk ample 
latitude to vary the timing and pace of su ch purchases depending on conditions in the 
market for such securities and on broader mortgage market and housing sector 
conditions.  The Committee may want to reit erate the limits that have already been 
announced for such purchases.   
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)
54 of 60
   
(51) If the Committee decides not to set a targ et at all, as in Alternative A, it 
could specify to the Desk that it has suspen ded setting a target and that it anticipates 
that the reserve conditions associated  with its open market operations and the 
liquidity programs put in place by the Federa l Reserve will result in federal funds rates 
near zero.  It may also direct the desk to purchase GSE debt and agency-guaranteed 
MBS over the next intermeeting period, as under Alternative B, and subject to the 
same limits. 
(52) Draft language for the direct ives is provided below. 
Directive Wording 
Alternative A :  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and 
financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.  Over the interm eeting period, the Committee directs the 
Desk to purchase GSE debt and agency-guaranteed MBS, with the aim of 
providing support to the mortgage and housing markets.  The timing and pace 
of these purchases should depend on conditions in the markets for such 
securities and on a broader assessment of conditions in primary mortgage 
markets and the housing sector.  By the en d of the second quarter of next year, 
the Desk is expected to purchase up to $100 billion in housing-related GSE 
debt and up to $500 billion in agency-guaranteed MBS.  The Committee has suspended setting a target for the federal funds rate, and it anticipates that the 
reserve conditions associated with its open market operations and the liquidity 
programs put in place by the Federal Reserve will result in federal funds rates 
near zero.  
Alternative B :  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and 
financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable 
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)
55 of 60
   
growth in output.  To further its long-run objectives, the Committee seeks 
conditions in reserve markets consistent with federal funds trading in a range of 
0 to ¼ percent.  The Committee directs the Desk to purchase GSE debt and 
agency-guaranteed MBS during the intermeeting period with the aim of 
providing support to the mortgage and housing markets.  The timing and pace of these purchases should depend on conditions in the markets for such 
securities and on a broader assessment of conditions in primary mortgage 
markets and the housing sector.  By the en d of the second quarter of next year, 
the Desk is expected to purchase up to $100 billion in housing-related GSE 
debt and up to $500 billion in agency-guaranteed MBS. 
Alternative C :  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and 
financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable 
growth in output.  To further its long-run objectives, the Committee has 
established a target for the federal funds ra te of ½ percent.  In view of the large 
volume of reserves provided by th e Federal Reserve's various liquidity 
programs, the Committee recognizes that the federal funds rate is likely to 
average somewhat below the ½ percent ta rget rate.  The Committee directs the 
Desk to purchase GSE debt and agency-guaranteed MBS during the 
intermeeting period with the aim of pr oviding support to the mortgage and 
housing markets.  The timing and pace of these purchases should depend on conditions in the markets for such securities and on a broader assessment of 
conditions in primary mortgage markets and the housing sector.  By the end of 
the second quarter of next year, the De sk is expected to purchase up to 
$100 billion in housing-related GSE de bt and up to $500 billion in agency-
guaranteed MBS.

Alternative D:   The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and 
financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable 
growth in output.  The Committee has maintained its target for the federal 
funds rate at 1 percent, but in view of the large volume of reserves provided by 
the Federal Reserve's various liquidity programs, the Committee recognizes that 
the federal funds rate is likely to aver age somewhat below the 1 percent target 
rate.

Measure Description 
Single-equation 
Model  The measure of the equilibrium real rate in the single-equation model is based on an 
estimated aggregate-demand relationship between  the current value of the output gap and 
its lagged values as well as the lagged va lues of the real federal funds rate. 
Small Structural 
Model  The small-scale model of the economy consists  of equations for six variables: the output 
gap, the equity premium, the federal budget surp lus, the trend growth rate of output, the 
real bond yield, and the real federal funds rate. 
Large Model 
(FRB/US) Estimates of the equilibrium real rate using FRB/US—the staff’s large-scale econometric 
model of the U.S. economy—depend on a very broad array of economic factors, some of 
which take the form of projected valu es of the model’s exogenous variables. 
Greenbook-
consistent  The FRB/US model is used in conjunction with an extended version of the Greenbook 
forecast to derive a Greenbook-consistent measure .  FRB/US is first add-factored so that 
its simulation matches the extended Greenbook forecast, and then a second simulation is 
run off this baseline to determine the value of the real federal funds rate that closes the 
output gap. 
TIPS-based 
Factor Model Yields on TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) reflect investors’ expectations of the future path of real interest rates, but also include term and liquidity premiums.  The 
TIPS-based measure of the equilibrium real ra te is constructed using the seven-year-ahead 
instantaneous real forward rate derived fro m TIPS yields as of the Bluebook publication 
date.  This forward rate is adjusted to remove estimates of the term and liquidity 
premiums based on a three-factor arbitrage -free term-structure model applied to TIPS 
yields, nominal yields, and inflation.  Because TIPS indexation is based on the total CPI, this measure is also adjusted for the me dium-term difference—projected at 40 basis 
points—between total CPI inflation and core PCE inflation. 
 
 The equilibrium real rate is the real  federal funds rate that, if maintained, would be projected to return 
output to its potential level over time.   The short-run equilibrium rate is  defined as the rate that would 
close the output gap in twelve qua rters given the corresponding model’s projection of the economy.   
The medium-run concept is the value of  the real federal funds rate proj ected to keep ou tput at potential 
in seven years, under the assumption that monetary policy acts to bring actua l and potential output into 
line in the short run and then keeps them equal thereafter.  The TIPS-based factor model measure 
provides an estimate of market expectations for the real federal funds rate seven years ahead.  
The actual real federal funds rate is  constructed as the difference betw een the nominal rate and realized 
inflation, where the nominal rate is measured as the quarterly average of the observed federal funds rate, 
and realized inflation is given by the log difference between the co re PCE price index and its lagged 
value four quarters earlier.  For th e current quarter, the nominal rate is specified as the target federal 
funds rate on the Bluebook publication date.  For the current quarter and th e previous quarter, the 
inflation rate is computed using the staff’s estimat e of the core PCE price i ndex. If the upcoming FOMC 
meeting falls early in the quarter, the lagged in flation measure ends in the last quarter.   
Confidence intervals reflect uncertainties about model specification, coefficients, and the level of 
potential output.  The final column of the table in dicates the values published in the previous Bluebook.

  Estimates of the real federal funds rate depend on the proxies for expected in flation used.  The table 
below shows estimated real federal funds rates base d on lagged core PCE infl ation, the definition used 
in the Equilibrium Real Federal Funds Rate char t; lagged four-quarter head line PCE inflation; and 
projected four-quarter headline PCE inflation beginning with the next quar ter.  For each estimate of the 
real rate, the table also provides the Greenbook-consistent measure of th e short-run equilibrium real rate 
and the average actual real federal funds rate over the next twelve quarters.

Appendix B: Analysis of Policy Paths and Confidence Intervals  
Rule Specifications :  For the following rules, it denotes the federal funds rate for quarter t , while  
the explanatory variables include the staff’s projec tion of trailing four-quart er core PCE inflation ( πt), 
inflation two and three quarters ahead ( πt+2|t and π t+3|t), the output gap in the current period and one 
quarter ahead ( yy*
tt−  and yy*
tt++1|−t1|t), and the three-quarter-ahead forecast of annual average GDP 
growth relative to potential ( Δ−44yy*
tt++3|Δt3|t), and π* denotes an assumed value of policymakers’  
 
 long-run inflation objective.  The outcome-based a nd forecast-based rules were estimated using real-
time data over the sample 1988:1-2006:4; each specifi cation was chosen using the Bayesian information 
criterion. Each rule incorporates a 75 basis point shift in the interc ept, specified as a sequence of  
25 basis point increments during the first three quarters of 1998.  The first two simple rules were 
proposed by Taylor (1993, 1999).  The prescriptions  of the first-difference rule do not depend on 
assumptions regarding r*  or the level of the outpu t gap; see Orphanides (2003). 
Outcome-based rule it =  1.20i t-1–0.39i t-2+0.19[1.17  + 1.73 πt  + 3.66(*

Forecast-based rule  it =  1.18i t-1–0.38i t-2+0.20[0.98 +1.72 πt+2|t+2.29(*

Taylor (1993) rule it = 2 + π t + 0.5(πt –*π) + 0.5(*

Taylor (1999) rule  it = 2 + π t + 0.5(πt –*π) + (*
ttyy− ) 
First-difference rule it = it-1 + 0.5(πt+3|t –*π) + 0.5(44*
3| 3| tt ttyy+ + Δ− Δ ) 
FRB/US Model Simulations :  Prescriptions from the two empiri cal rules are computed using dynamic 
simulations of the FRB/US model, implemented as though the rule were followed starting at this FOMC 
meeting.  The dotted line labeled “Previous Bluebook” is  based on the current specification of the policy 
rule, applied to the previous Gr eenbook projection.  Confidence intervals are based on stochastic 
simulations of the FRB/US model with shocks drawn from the estimated residuals over 1986-2005.  
Information from Financial Markets :  The expected funds rate path is based on forward rate 
agreements, and the confidence intervals for this path are constructed using prices of interest rate caps. 
Near-Term Prescriptions of Simple Policy Rules :  These prescriptions are calculated using Greenbook 
projections for inflation and the output gap. Because the first-difference rule involves the lagged funds 
rate, the value labeled “Previous Bluebook” for the curr ent quarter is computed using the actual value  
of the lagged funds rate, and the one -quarter-ahead prescriptions are ba sed on this rule’s prescription for 
the current quarter.
