MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES   
   
Recent Developments 
Summary 
(1) Conditions in some financial markets showed tentative and limited 
improvements during the intermeeting pe riod; nevertheless, extraordinary stresses 
remained and concerns about financial institutions increased significantly in the latter 
part of the period.  A number of credit sp reads declined from the exceptionally high 
levels that prevailed from mid-September through mid-December, but most were still 
elevated compared to their historical rang es.  In short-term funding markets, year-end 
passed with little incident, partly reflecting the large supply of dollar liquidity from the 
Federal Reserve and other central banks.  Ma ny financial institutions posted further 
significant losses in the fourth quarter, and their equity prices and credit default swap 
(CDS) spreads indicate that investors continued to have significant concerns about the health of the financial sector and remained uncertain about potential policy 
responses. 
(2) Market participants marked down the expected path of the federal funds 
rate in response to the December FOMC decision, weaker-than-expected economic 
data, and renewed concerns about the financ ial sector.  Market and survey measures 
of policy expectations suggest that investor s expect the target federal funds rate to 
remain within its current range through the first half of this year.  Yields on long-term nominal Treasury securities rose on net, with notable increases at the end of the 
intermeeting period.  Yields on TIPS fell, re portedly as a result of some improvement 
in TIPS market liquidity.   
(3) Broad equity price indexes decreased on net during the intermeeting period, 
as investors remained concerned about th e economic outlook and the condition of

the financial sector.  The Federal Reserve’ s programs to purchase agency debt and 
mortgage-backed securities (MBS) were received positively by market participants, and 
reportedly contributed to the improved abil ity of the agencies to access long-term 
debt markets.  Investment-grade corpor ate bond spreads declined modestly and 
issuance of nonfinancial investment-grade bond s continued to be fairly solid.  In 
contrast, issuance of speculative-grade bonds continued to be quite limited despite a 
noticeable decline in spreads, and issuance of  asset-backed securities (ABS) remained 
negligible.  Bank credit contracted agai n in December.  Results from the January 
Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey indicate d a further tightening of banks’ lending 
policies on all major loan categories, albeit  by somewhat smaller percentages of banks 
than in recent surveys, and broad reductio ns in loan demand.  A number of foreign 
central banks eased monetary policy further on signs of a global economic slowdown. 
Financial Institutions 
(4) Although investors’ concerns about the condition of financ ial institutions 
appeared to ease somewhat during much of the intermeeting period, market sentiment 
toward financial firms soured again late in the period as the fourth-quarter earnings 
season got under way.  CDS spreads for U.S. bank holding companies, which had 
narrowed for the first few weeks of the pe riod, rose sharply in mid-January and 
returned to very high levels, mainly in response to renewed concerns about the 
viability of Citigroup and Bank of Americ a in their current forms and the possibility 
that other major financial institutions co uld face considerable strains (Chart 1).  
Equity prices for bank holding compan ies fell to below their November lows, 
reflecting continued concerns  about the longer-term prospect for profits.  Goldman 
Sachs and Morgan Stanley reported larger-tha n-expected losses for their fiscal fourth 
quarter as they wrote down more assets.  JP Morgan posted a small profit that was held down by asset writedowns and losses in  the firm’s investment banking unit, while

Citigroup reported a large loss and announced a reorganization that would split the 
business into two units.  A number of regional banks also reported sizable losses.  Many financial institutions raised their loan  loss provisions in anticipation of further 
increases in charge-offs.  (5) Bank of America reported large losses in the fourth quarter, both in its 
legacy operations and particularly in its recently acquired Merrill Lynch investment bank unit.  On January 16, the U.S. govern ment entered into an agreement with Bank 
of America to provide assistance to the in stitution.  Also during the intermeeting 
period, the U.S. government entered into agreements to provide support to General Motors Acceptance Corporation (GMAC) and Chrysler Financial.  Details of these 
agreements are provided in the box “U.S. Government Assistance to Three Financial 
Institutions.” (6) Developments at other financial institutions were mixed.  Equity prices of 
insurance companies edged down over th e intermeeting period while their CDS 
spreads fell some from extremely high leve ls.  One worrisome factor for the sector 
was rising delinquency rates on loans backin g commercial mortgage-backed securities 
(CMBS)—an asset class in which insuranc e companies are major investors.  The 
CMBS market remained all but shut down  and spreads on the CMBX index moved 
back up to near their November peaks.  Hedge funds posted negative average returns 
again in December and, according to one measure, closed the year with an annual loss of 23 percent.  In the wake of the recent poor performance, industry sources indicated 
a record number of funds were liquida ted in the third quarter and redemption 
requests reportedly remained elevated during the fourth quarter.  The revelation of the 
alleged Ponzi scheme of Bernard Madoff c ontributed to further negative sentiment 
about lightly regulated financial entities .  Treasury- and government-only money 
market mutual funds (MMMFs) faced pressures stemming from very low short-term 
interest rates, and many have waived fees in an effort to re tain investors.  In contrast,

 U.S. Government Assistance to Three Financial Institutions  
To help promote financial stability and economic recovery, over the intermeeting period the 
U.S. government entered into agreements to provide assistance to Bank of America, GMAC, 
and Chrysler Financial.  This box pr ovides a summary of those agreements. 
Bank of America reported very large losses for th e fourth quarter of 2008.  In addition to 
poor results in its commercial banking operations, its recently acquired Merrill Lynch 
investment bank unit booked pr e-tax losses of more than $20 billion.  To limit the 
potentially adverse effect on financial market stability from the announcement of these results, the U.S. government entered into an  agreement with Bank of America on January 
16.  The Treasury and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) will provide 
protection against the possibility of unusually  large losses on an asset pool of about $118 
billion of loans, securities backed by resident ial and commercial real estate loans, and other 
such assets, all of which have been marked to current market value.  The large majority of 
these assets were acquired by Bank of America in  its purchase of Merrill Lynch.  The assets 
will remain on Bank of America’s balance sheet. 
Under the terms of the agreement, Bank of Amer ica would absorb the first $10 billion of 
eligible losses on the pool.  Losses above th at amount would be split 90-10 between the 
Treasury/FDIC and Bank of America, with a maximum of $10 billion in losses for the 
Treasury/FDIC.  As a fee for this protecti on, Bank of America will issue $4 billion of 
preferred stock with an 8 percent dividend ra te and warrants with an aggregate value of 10 
percent of the total amount of preferred i ssued.  Beyond that, the Federal Reserve would 
take residual losses on the pool through non-recourse lending, subject to Bank of America’s continued 10 percent loss sharing.  Bank of Am erica may draw upon the loan facility if and 
when losses on the pool reach $18 billion.  A fee of 20 basis points per year will be charged 
on the undrawn amounts of the facility and a floa ting rate of OIS plus 300 basis points will 
be charged on drawn amounts.  In addition, the Treasury used $20 billion of TARP funds to 
purchase Bank of America preferred stock, brin ging the Treasury’s total investment in Bank 
of America to $45 billion. 
GMAC faced considerable strains from slow originations (because of very weak motor 
vehicle sales) and deteriorating loan quality.  To address these strains, GMAC began to 
prepare to apply for bank holdin g company status.  To increase its capital as part of that 
process, it offered a debt-equity swap but th e offering ultimately was undersubscribed.  
Despite that setback, GMAC applied for, an d was granted, bank holdi ng company status on 
December 24, as the Federal Rese rve Board determined it had sufficient capital to satisfy 
requirements.  To support the motor vehicle market, the U.S. government on December 29 
entered into an agreement to provide ca pital support to GMAC under the TARP.  
Class I FOMC--Restricted Controlled (FR)

Under the agreement, the U.S. Treasury purc hased $5 billion of GMAC senior preferred 
equity, and provided a $1 billion loan to GM to  participate in a rights offering for GMAC.  
These funds were in addition to the $13.4 billion of TARP funds pledged to GM and 
Chrysler to stabilize those firms.  CDS sp reads on GMAC senior de bt, which had already 
declined from their mid-D ecember highs, dropped furthe r on the announcement.  For 
similar reasons, on January 16, the Treasury annou nced it would make a $1.5 billion five-year 
loan of TARP funds, secured by a senior secured interest in a poo l of newly-originated 
consumer auto loans, to a special purpose enti ty created by Chrysler Financial.  Chrysler 
Holding will serve as a guaran tor for certain covenants of Chrysler Financial.

prime MMMFs had net inflows over the intermeeting period as they remained 
attractive to investors, and appeared on ce again to be purchasing asset-backed 
commercial paper (ABCP).   
(7) Funding for a number of major financial institutions in the intermeeting 
period was supported by the FDIC’s Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program 
(TLGP).  So far, financial institutions have issued about $130 billion through the 
program; about three-quarters of this i ssuance was concentrated at six firms—GE 
Capital, JP Morgan, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and Wells 
Fargo.  Most of this issuance has been at a fixed rate fo r three years (close to the 
maximum period covered by the FDIC guarantee).1  Spreads on FDIC-guaranteed 
debt have declined to levels close to those on agency debt—about 60 to 100 basis 
points above comparable-maturity Treasury securities.  In this period, little non-FDIC-guaranteed debt was issued by financ ial institutions.  GE Capital issued non-
FDIC-insured thirty-year bonds, but it had to offer an unusually wide spread to do so. 
Market Functioning 
(8) Stresses in the money markets eased ov er the intermeeting period, reflecting 
the passing of year-end and ample dollar liquidity provided by the Federal Reserve 
and other central banks.  Still, conditions remained significantly strained at longer 
tenors.  In unsecured bank funding markets, Libor fixings at most maturities declined 
and spreads over comparable-maturity overnight index swap (OIS) rates narrowed 
further on net.  The one-month Libor-OIS sp read declined to its lowest level since 
late 2007; however, the three- and six-mont h spreads as well as forward one-month 
spreads remained high (Chart 2).  Market reports indicated that banks became more 
                                           
1 On January 16, the FDIC announced that it would propose a rule change to the TLGP to 
extend the maturity limit of the guarantee up to 10 years where the debt is supported by 
collateral and the issuance supports new household lending.

willing to extend liquidity to each other out to at least the one-month horizon, but the 
terms of interbank lending were said to be still counterparty-specific in some cases. 
(9) In secured funding markets, conditi ons showed some improvement, but 
activity at longer tenors reportedly remained limited.  With the overnight Treasury general collateral repo rate near zero for most of the period, implying low penalties 
for delivery failures, market participants we re reportedly reluctant to lend Treasury 
collateral out of concerns about potential  fails.  This reluctance to lend was 
exacerbated in the first part of the inte rmeeting period by year-end concerns.  
Overnight securities lending from the SOMA portfolio increased as year-end approached, but it remained well below the extremely elevated levels of September and October.  Delivery fails continued to run well under the high levels of September 
and October, reflecting in part reduction in transaction volumes as well as industry efforts to mitigate fails, including the January 5 recommendation of the Treasury 
Market Practices Group to implement a fina ncial charge on settlement fails beginning 
in May.  Conditions in the markets for re po transactions backed by agency debt and 
MBS improved some, especially for overnight contracts, although strains remained evident in term markets.  Average bid-aske d spreads declined notably, but in most 
cases were still above those prior to September, while haircuts were little changed at high levels. 
(10) Changes in conditions in the Treasury bill market pointed to a reduction in 
flight-to-quality flows.  Although Treasury b ill rates remained very low, reflecting low 
overnight interest rates and expectations that they will remain so for some time, yields 
increased modestly on net over the inte rmeeting period.  The Treasury issued 
additional cash management bills under th e Supplementary Financing Program (SFP), 
but the outstanding level of SFP bills stil l fell from $405 billion on December 10 to 
around $175 billion at the end of the period. 
Class I FOMC--Restricted Controlled (FR)

(11) Conditions in the commercial paper (CP) market improved over the 
intermeeting period, reflecting continued effects of the meas ures taken by the Federal 
Reserve to support this market, greater demand from institutional investors, and the 
passing of year-end.  Yields and spread s on 30-day A1/P1 nonfinancial and financial 
CP as well as on asset-backed commercia l paper (ABCP) declined modestly and 
remained low.  More notably, yields and spreads on 30-day A2/P2 CP, which is not 
eligible for purchase under the Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF), dropped 
sharply after the beginning of the year, in part reflecting the dissipation of year-end 
pressures.  The amount of unsecured CP outsta nding that has been issued by financial 
and nonfinancial companies and the amount of ABCP outstanding both were little 
changed on net over the intermeeting period. (12) The increase in the amount of CP ou tstanding is more than accounted for 
by issuance into the CPFF.  As of January 21, credit extended under the CPFF was 
$351 billion, $40 billion a bove the level on December 10.  Credit extended under the 
Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility 
(AMLF) declined further over the intermee ting period to about $15 billion as of 
January 21.  To date, the M oney Market Investor Fundin g Facility (MMIFF) program 
has registered no activity.
2  The low demand for credit from the AMLF and the 
MMIFF probably reflects continued net flow s into money market mutual funds, the 
institutions that these two facilities were primarily designed to support. 
                                           
2 There was no activity even though on Januar y 7, the Federal Reserve Board announced two 
changes to the MMIFF, expanding the set of in stitutions eligible to participate in the 
MMIFF and adjusting several of it s economic parameters to enable the program to remain a 
viable source of backup liquidity for investors ev en at very low levels of short-term interest 
rates.  Specifically, the set of eligible institutions was expanded to include securities lenders 
and U.S.-based investment funds that operate in a manner similar to money market mutual 
funds, such as some local government invest ment pools, common trust funds, and collective 
investment funds.  Second, the minimum yield on eligible assets was reduced to 60 basis 
points above the primary credit rate at  the time of purchase of the asset. 
Class I FOMC--Restricted Controlled (FR)

(13) Functioning in the market for Treasury coupon securities continued to 
show signs of impairment.  The on-the-run premium for the ten-year nominal 
Treasury note was little changed over the in termeeting period at very elevated levels. 
The average absolute difference between yi elds on actual Treasury securities and 
corresponding yields read from an estimated yield curve declined in the period but remained high, indicating a continuing abse nce of arbitrage, presumably reflecting 
balance-sheet constraints and risk aversion  of market participants.  Trading volumes 
in the Treasury market fell to very low levels at the end of 2008, although they recovered a bit after the end of the year.  More encouragingly, bid-asked spreads in 
the on-the-run market declined sharply at the beginning of 2009 after reaching 
extremely wide levels at the end of 2008; their levels at the end of the period were 
near those seen before the heightened market volatility last fall.   (14) Liquidity in the corporate bond market improved somewhat, with 
particularly notable declines in estimated bid-asked spreads for speculative-grade bonds, and an increase in trading volumes for both investment- and speculative-grade 
bonds, although volumes remained relatively lo w.  Liquidity and price discovery in the 
CDS market remained poor, as the number of dealers providing quotes continued to 
be low, particularly for financial firm s.  The dispersion of quotes narrowed 
significantly over the period, but it was st ill quite wide.  The market for CMBS, which 
had sold off sharply in the pr evious intermeeting period, continued to be strained.  
The CMBX index—an index based on CDS spreads on AAA-rated CMBS—widened during this intermeeting period and is only modestly below the peak levels in November.  Conditions in the leveraged loan market remained very poor.  Secondary 
market prices for leveraged loans stayed ne ar historic lows.  The average bid-asked 
spread in this market continued to be ex tremely wide.  Implied spreads on the LCDX 
index dropped sharply after the December FOMC  meeting, but rose substantially in

the latter part of the intermeeting period  and remain well above the levels that 
prevailed prior to October 2008. 
(15) Depository instit utions continued to make substantial use of the discount 
window, although the amount of credit declin ed, reflecting, for the most part, reduced 
borrowing by foreign institutions.  Primary credit outstanding fell markedly during the 
period from $90 billion on December 10 to $63 billion on January 21.  TAF auctions, for both 28-day and 84-day credit, were un dersubscribed in the intermeeting period, 
continuing the pattern that has prevailed since the early October expansion of the 
auction amounts to $150 billion.   The number of bidders was similar to that in other 
recent auctions except for the January 12 auction of 28-day credit, which saw a record high number of bidders.
3  The amount of credit outstanding under the TAF remained 
around $400 billion throughout the period; as of January 21, it was $416 billion.  The 
Term Securities Lending Facility (TSLF) auct ions held during the period also were 
undersubscribed, and market participants ex ercised only $7 billion of the options on 
$50 billion of TSLF loans ag ainst Schedule 2 collateral on their December 22 exercise 
date.  The amount of securities lent throug h the TSLF declined $52 billion to about 
$133 billion as of January 21.  Use of th e Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF) 
declined further over the intermeeting peri od, with the amount ou tstanding falling to 
$33 billion on January 21 from $52 billion on December 10.   
(16) The effective federal funds rate stayed within the new target range of 0 to 
0.25 percent established at the December FOMC meeting throughout the intermeeting period, and trading volumes in the funds market were generally quite low.  Very recently, however, trading volu me has picked up some and federal funds 
                                           
3 Starting with the January 12 auction, the mini mum bid rate was adjusted to be equal to the 
interest rate paid on excess reserve balances ra ther than the OIS rate for the term of the 
auction at the date of the announcement.  This  adjustment was made to remove an arbitrage 
opportunity at this time of very low interest rates.

have traded closer to the upper end of th e target range, particularly during the 
morning hours. 
Monetary Policy Expectations and Treasury Yields 
(17) The FOMC’s decision at its December meeting to lower the target federal 
funds rate from 1 percent to a range of 0 to 0.25 percent was more aggressive than 
market expectations prior to the meeting.  Furthermore, market participants reportedly did not fully anticipate the indications that the FOMC may keep rates low for some time and that the FOMC may en gage in nontraditional policy such as the 
purchase of longer-term Treasury securities.  Consequently, market expectations for the path of the federal funds rate move d downward for most horizons.  Economic 
data released late in the intermeeting peri od came in generally weaker than expected 
and, along with increased concerns about the health of some financial institutions as 
fourth-quarter earnings began to be reporte d, pushed futures rates lower (Chart 3).  
Futures rates currently suggest that investors expect that the effective federal funds rate will remain within the current target ra nge through the first half of this year and 
then rise gradually thereafter, with the effe ctive rate reaching about 1.4 percent by the 
end of 2010.  However, uncertainty about the size of term premiums and potential distortions created by the zero lower bound for the federal funds rate make it difficult 
to obtain a definitive reading on policy ex pectations of market participants from 
futures prices (see the box “Gauging Invest or Expectations for Future Interest Rate 
Policy with Uncertain Term Premiums” for a discussion of term premium effects).  In 
a very low interest rate environment, it is more likely that the zero lower bound could 
truncate the distribution of future short-term interest rates and lead to a greater positive skew in the distribution.  In this case, expected future short interest rates 
implied by futures prices would be push ed up above market participants’ modal 
forecasts.  Consistent with either of these distortionary factors, the primary dealers in

 Gauging Investor Expectations for Future Interest Rate Policy with 
Uncertain Term Premiums 
As shown by the black solid line in the graph below, under the staff’s standard 
1 basis point per month assumption for the term premium, futures quotes 
imply that investors now anticipate that the FOMC will raise the funds rate 
above the current 0 to 25 basis point range in  the second half of this year.  This 
outlook is noticeably above the staff’s a ssumption for the federal funds rate in 
the Greenbook.  The steeper tra
jectory for the federal funds rate in the futures 
path could reflect a more sanguine ec onomic outlook on the part of investors 
than in the Greenbook.  However, the heightened financial market turmoil of 
recent months may be affecting investors’ perceptions of risk and their tolerance for risk.  As a consequence, term premiums might currently be larger 
than the staff’s usual assumption. 
The red-dotted and blue-dashed lines in  the chart below show the expected 
federal funds rate paths under two alternative measures of the term premiums 
embedded in futures rates.  Under the assumption that investors are unlikely to 
forecast significantly different policy rates four years ahead versus five years 
ahead, the slope of the Eurodollar futures curve at that horizon should be 
determined largely by term premium s.  The blue dashed line shows the 
expected path for the funds rate using such an estimate of the term premium, 
which is currently about 2 basis points  per month.  The red dotted line shows 
the expected path for the federal funds rate based on term premium estimates calculated using an affine, three-fact or, no-arbitrage model of the OIS term 
structure with a non-negativity constr aint on the expected funds rate.  
Estimated term premiums are maturity-speci fic in this case, ranging from 1 to 4
basis points.  
Both of these alternative measures of the expected funds rate path imply less 
policy tightening over the next two years  than the conventional calculation.  
This divergence underscores the relevance of model uncertainty for inferences 
about investor expectations for the federal funds rate from futures in current 
circumstances.

  The Desk’s survey of primary dealers on January 21 provides an alternative, 
non-model-based measure of the expected federal funds rate path.  According 
to this survey, respondents expect the first rate increase above the current 
target range to occur in the second quart er of 2010, which is one quarter later 
than implied by the affine term structure model.     
 
  
Class I FOMC--Restricted Controlled (FR)

the Desk survey expected, on average, that the Committee will first increase rates in 
the second quarter of 2010, although they hold a wide range of beliefs on this issue. 
(18) On net, off-the-run nominal two-year Treasury yields increased 15 basis 
points over the intermeeting period, while te n-year yields rose 13 basis points.  Until 
late in the intermeeting period , long-term Treasury yields reportedly were driven lower 
in part by expectations that the Federa l Reserve may begin pu rchasing long-term 
Treasury securities.  On average, responden ts to the Desk’s survey of primary dealers 
assigned a roughly 50 percent probability to  this possibility, with a wide dispersion 
across respondents.  However, other factors also appeared to help push long-term 
yields lower, including increased concerns  about the economy and the conditions of 
financial institutions, investor expectations  that short-term rates will remain low for 
longer than previously anticipated, and greater hedging demand generated by lower 
mortgage rates.  Working in the opposite direction, particularly toward the end of the intermeeting period, expectations for increa sed Treasury issuance to finance larger-
than-previously-expected deficits as we ll as the new Administration’s economic 
stimulus plan pushed up yields.   (19) Yields on inflation-indexed Treasury securities dropped sharply over the 
intermeeting period and inflation compensa tion over the next five years (carry 
adjusted) increased about 115 basis point s to -0.24 percent, while inflation 
compensation five- to ten-years ahead rose modestly on net to 2.62 percent.  A good amount of the increase in the five-year meas ure appeared to reflect improved trading 
conditions in the TIPS market, as a well-rece ived auction of ten-year inflation-indexed 
Treasury securities reportedly reduced concerns about the li quidity of such securities 
and thus led investors to accept a smaller premium to hold them.  Nonetheless, comparable measures of inflation compen sation obtained from inflation swaps moved 
higher over the intermeeting period.  Liquidity in both the TIPS and inflation swaps market remained quite poor and readings of inflation compensation from these

markets may not provide accurate readings of inflation expectations and inflation risk.  
According to the Michigan household su rvey, near-term inflation expectations 
remained fairly low, consistent with cont inued low oil prices.  However, long-term 
inflation expectations have been rather vola tile, rising in mid-January to a relatively 
high level of 3 percent after reaching a multi-year low in December.  
Capital Markets 
(20) Investors’ concerns about the financia l sector and the possibility of a deep 
and prolonged recession weighed on equity pr ices.  On net, broad equity indexes 
declined 3¾ to 4¾ percent over the period and financial shares substantially 
underperformed (Chart 4).  Even though an alysts anticipated substantial declines in 
corporate profits in the fourth quarter in both the financial and nonfinancial sectors, 
the initial corporate financial reports for the quarter generally were below 
expectations.  The spread between the twelve-month forward trend earnings-price ratio for the S&P 500 firms and the long-t erm Treasury yield—a rough gauge of the 
equity risk premium—declined modestly  but remained exceptionally elevated.  
Option-implied volatility of the S&P 500 dec lined over much of the period; however, 
it began to rise again later in  the period and it generally st ayed in the upper end of its 
historical range. (21) In the corporate bond market, spreads on BBB-rated and speculative-grade 
bonds relative to Treasuries declined marke dly over the intermeeting period, although 
they stayed extremely elevated.  Acco rding to CDX indexes, risk spreads on 
investment-grade corporate bonds also declin ed over the intermeeting period.  Gross 
issuance of bonds by investment-grade nonf inancial corporations remained fairly 
solid, while issuance by speculative-grade fi rms continued to be limited.  Issuance of 
leveraged syndicated loans was extraordinarily  weak in the fourth quarter, down about 
97 percent from the year–earlier quarter.

(22) The Federal Reserve programs to purchase the debt of the housing-related 
government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) and agency-backed MBS got fully under 
way in the intermeeting period.  The Federal Reserve purchased $11.9 billion (par 
value) of agency debt during the intermeeting period; since the program began 
operating on December 5, the Federal Reserv e has purchased $19.9 billion of agency 
debt (all numbers through January 21).  Even with these purchase s, spreads on agency 
debt over swaps rose on net over the intermeeting period; nevertheless, they remain 
below levels seen prior to the program’s announcement and initiation.  The purchases 
also reportedly contributed to the market’s generally receptive response to the renewal of debt issuance by the agencies.  The Federal Reserve began the agency-backed MBS purchase program on January 5; through Ja nuary 21, purchases have totalled about 
$52.6 billion (current face value).
4  Evidently in response to these purchases, the 
unadjusted spread on agency MBS over swap s rates dropped sharply immediately after 
the initial purchases; later in the period, spreads rose but were moderately lower on net over the intermeeting period.  The interest rate on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages 
declined markedly over the intermeeting peri od to just above 5 percent.  The spread 
between this mortgage rate and the 10-year  Treasury yield also declined since the 
December FOMC meeting, but it stayed elevated relative to its range over the past 
year. 
(23) The markets for asset-backed securities (ABS) remained very stressed as 
issuers awaited the beginning of operations of the Term Asset-Backed Security Loan 
Facility (TALF) in late February.  Spre ads for all types of ABS continued to be 
                                           
4 This amount is the contracted amount of purchases.  Because the MBS market can have 
significant delays to settlement and this progra m is in its early stages, the contracted amount 
of purchases is well above the level of MBS in the SOMA portfolio ($6.0 billion, see 
footnote 4).  Of the contracted purchases so far, almost 90 percent were for 30-year maturity 
MBS with most of the rest having 15-year maturity.  The coupon on about 60 percent of 
these purchases was between 4 and 5 percent. About one-half of the purchased securities 
were backed by Freddie Mac, about one-third by Fannie Mae, and the remainder by Ginnie 
Mae. 
Class I FOMC--Restricted Controlled (FR)

extraordinarily high, although some spre ads came off their highs late in the 
intermeeting period, reportedly owing in part to the passing of year-end, anticipation 
of the TALF, and the FDIC’s proposed chan ges in the terms of the TLGP.  There 
was no issuance of credit card and student loan ABS in the fourth quarter.  During 
this period, credit cards were issued almost  exclusively by deposit ory institutions that 
obtained funds through programs such as the TLGP.  Student loan ABS experienced significant downgrades in recent months; the Department of Education has become 
the primary backstop for the student loan  market.  Issuance of auto loan ABS 
increased modestly in December from palt ry amounts in the previous two months, 
but remained unusually low and expensive.  As stated earlier, the problems in this market contributed to the difficulties at GM AC that led it to become a bank holding 
company.  Auto lenders, in particular, re portedly see the TALF as providing needed 
support to the market.  Late in the period , reports indicated that issuers had begun 
preparatory work to issue TALF-eligible ABS. (24) Issuance of long-term municipal bonds in the fourth quarter was somewhat 
below that of earlier in the year, and pre liminary data suggest it has stepped down 
modestly so far in January.  Even with the slower issuance, sentiment in the market 
improved some and yields on municipal bonds fell over the intermeeting period, both in absolute terms and relative to Treasury yields.  Nevertheless, municipal bond yields 
remained unusually high relative to Treasury yields, consistent with reports indicating 
that the credit quality of municipal bonds deteriorated further over the intermeeting 
period. 
Foreign Developments 
(25) Although conditions in foreign financia l markets were relatively stable over 
December, equity indexes fell sharply late in the intermeeting period as market 
participants’ concern about the global econ omic outlook and prospects for corporate 
Class I FOMC--Restricted Controlled (FR)

earnings increased (Chart 5).  The equity prices of European banks dropped following 
the announcement of very large prospective losses for the fourth quarter at the Royal 
Bank of Scotland and increased speculation  that losses at other foreign banks would 
prove larger than previously anticipated.  The United Kingdom authorities announced 
on January 19 a number of measures to addr ess the financial crisis in that country.5  
On net, equity indexes in Europe and Japan decreased 5 to 9 percent since the 
December Greenbook.  Despite the declines in equity prices, credit availability in 
interbank and other wholesale markets appeared to increase modestly in the wake of a variety of government efforts over the past  several months to support their financial 
systems.  Libor-OIS spreads in euros and st erling declined over the period, although 
they were above the corresponding spreads in dollars, and bids fell in central bank 
dollar funding auctions.   
(26) In response to weaker-than-expected  data on real activity and lower 
inflation pressures, central banks eased poli cy further during the intermeeting period.  
The Bank of England lowered its policy rate 50 basis points to a historical low of 1.5 
percent, the Bank of Japan re duced its policy rate 20 basis points to a level of 10 basis 
points, the European Central Bank cut its base  rate 50 basis points to 2 percent, and 
the Bank of Canada cut its policy rate 50 basis points to 1 percent.  The Bank of Japan also moved to implement some nontraditional policy measures.
6  Several central banks 
in emerging market economies also eased policy.  Market participants expect that many foreign central banks will ease policy further in 2009.  Long-term nominal sovereign bond yields in most major indu strial countries declined during the 
                                           
5 Notably, the United Kingdom authorities intr oduced an Asset Protection Scheme, in which 
the government would assume exposure to losses on some bank assets.  For additional 
details on this and other measures by the go vernments in the United Kingdom and other 
countries, see the International Deve lopments section of Greenbook Part II. 
6 These measures include increased outright purchases of Japanese government bonds, the 
establishment of a commercial paper facility, an d plans to examine the purchase of corporate 
bonds with less than one year remaining maturity.

intermeeting period, consistent with the loosening of monetary policy and reduced 
inflation pressures.   
(27) The dollar depreciated sharply in the aftermath of the December FOMC 
meeting and statement, but appreciated on ba lance over the period as a whole.  The 
major currencies index of the dollar has in creased about 3.1 percent on net since the 
December FOMC meeting, as appreciation versus the euro, the Canadian dollar, and 
sterling offset depreciation against the yen.  Indications of lower inflation and weaker 
real activity in the euro area and th e United Kingdom, which contributed to 
reductions in policy rates and lower polic y expectations, were factors behind the 
appreciation of the dollar.  The dollar in dex for other important trading partners 
increased about 1.6 percent, with the do llar changing little against the Chinese 
renminbi and most major Asian currencies, bu t appreciating against the Mexican peso.   
Debt, Bank Credit, and Money 
(28) The debt of the domestic nonfinancial sector expanded about 7¾ percent 
(annual rate) in the third quarter, somewhat  faster than estimated in the previous 
Greenbook, and notably faster than in the first half of 2008 (Chart 6).  The pickup in 
growth is the result of the surge in fe deral government borrowing related to the 
Supplementary Financing Progr am.  Household debt contracted in the third quarter, 
reflecting a reduction in home mortgages in  the weak housing market and minimal 
growth in consumer credit.  Business sect or debt growth moderated further in the 
quarter.  The pattern of rapid debt growth in the federal government sector and 
essentially no debt growth on net for the rest  of the domestic nonfinancial sector is 
estimated to have continued in the fourth quarter. (29) Commercial bank credit fell about 13 percent at an annual rate in 
December, its second consecutive monthly d ecline.  Commercial and industrial (C&I) 
loans contracted for a second consecutive month, reflecting a combination of tighter

credit supply and reduced loan demand.  In contrast, commercial real estate loans 
retained on bank balance sheets continued to increase moderately; however, their 
growth reportedly has been inflated at so me banks in recent months by the shutdown 
of the CMBS market.  Loans to households also declined in December.  Residential 
mortgage holdings at banks fell for the four th consecutive month, in part because of 
renewed loan sales to the GSEs and writ edowns of delinquent loans.  Loans drawn 
under home equity lines of credit continued to rise robustly, partly reflecting attractive 
terms on existing lines.  Consumer loans on  banks’ balance sheets increased solidly in 
December, although much of th e increase probably is attributable to banks’ inability 
to securitize such loans.   (30) The Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey conducted in January indicated 
that banks continued to tighten credit  standards and terms on all major loan 
categories over the past three months, alth ough the net percentage of banks doing so 
generally declined somewhat from the re cord highs in the October survey.  The 
fraction of banks reporting tighter lending standards fell the most for mortgage loans.  
All of the banks tightening lending stan dards and terms cited a weaker or more 
uncertain economic outlook as an important reason for the change in lending stance.  
In a set of special questions, notable frac tions of respondents reported that they had 
reduced the size of credit lines for a wide range of existing business and household customers over the past three months.  A majority of respondent banks also reported 
weaker demand for most types of loans, wi th the notable exception of residential 
mortgages to prime borrowers where only 10 percent of respondents, on net, reported weaker demand.   
(31) M2 rose 27¼ percent at an annual ra te in December, its fastest pace of 
growth since September 2001.  Liquid de posits increased briskly, as both demand 
deposits and savings deposits surged, probably reflecting a reallocation of wealth 
toward assets that have government insura nce or guarantees as backstops.  Savings 
Class I FOMC--Restricted Controlled (FR)

deposits may also have been boosted by declining yields on retail money market 
funds.  The strength in small time deposit s persisted, likely owing to a number of 
commercial banks offering aggressive rates to build core deposits.  Currency growth 
also remained strong as foreign demand for U. S. bank notes remained elevated.  Retail 
money market funds increased modestly in December followi ng a decline in 
November.

Economic Outlook 
(32) Economic data received since the D ecember Greenbook indicate that the 
economy remains in a severe and deepening recession.  Housing starts, industrial 
production, and employment declined more than expected; real GDP is now 
estimated to have fallen at a 5 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter of last year. 
Meanwhile, price pressures have dropped sharply.  In these circumstances, the staff 
assumes that the target range for the fede ral funds rate will remain 0 to ¼ percent 
through the end of the forecast period.  Lo ng-term Treasury yields are projected to 
drift up over the next two years from a leve l that is about 20 basis points lower than 
in December, reflecting an assumed waning of safe-haven demands as economic activity begins to improve later this year and as the ten-year window for the Treasury 
yield extends further beyond the period of very low short-term interest rates 
anticipated over the medium term.  Mortga ge rates declined roughly in line with 
Treasury yields over the intermeeting period , and they are expected to decline further, 
reflecting a gradual narrowing of the current ly wide spread of mortgage rates over 
Treasury yields.  Similarly, corporate bond spreads narrow and yields decline over the 
next two years as economic conditions eventually improve and risk aversion abates.  
Boosted by an assumed decline in the equity risk premium, equity prices rise at an 
annual rate of about 12 percent from a level that is around 4 percent lower than in the 
December projection.  The real foreign exchan ge value of the dollar is roughly flat in 
2009 and declines about 3 percent in 2010.   Oil prices have dropped about $5 per 
barrel since the December meeting, but they are projected to rise markedly over the forecast period, in line with futures quotes, to just under $60 per barrel by the end of 
2010, $6 per barrel below their level in the previous forecast.  The staff assumes that a large fiscal stimulus program, amounting to about $800 billion over two years, will be 
approved by the Congress before the end of the current quarter.  The assumed fiscal stimulus is about $300 billion larg er than in the December forecast. 
Class I FOMC--Restricted Controlled (FR)
29 of 52  
   
(33) Against this backdrop, real GDP is projected to decline at a 5½ percent 
annual rate in the current quarter, slightly faster than in the previous Greenbook.  
GDP declines at a 1¼ percent rate in the second quarter.  A modest rebound begins 
in the third quarter, with GDP rising at a 2 percent rate in the second half of 2009, 
roughly ¾ percentage point faster than in the December forecast .  In 2010, GDP is 
projected to grow 2½ percent.  The unemploy ment rate is anticipated to peak at 8½ 
percent by the beginning of 2010 before ed ging down to around 8 percent over the 
course of the year.  The output gap exceeds 5 percent throughout the forecast period.  
This slack in resource utilization, combined  with relatively flat prices of most 
commodities and imports, leads to a modera tion of core PCE inflation from about 2 
percent last year to 1 percent this year and ¾ percent next year.  Overall PCE 
inflation is projected at about ½ percen t in 2009 and 1 percent in 2010.  These 
inflation projections are little changed from the December Greenbook.     
Monetary Policy Strategies  
(34) As indicated in Chart 7, the Greenbook-consistent measure of short-run r* 
now stands at -3.0 percent, about 40 basis po ints above the level estimated at the time 
of the December Bluebook.  This upward revi sion primarily reflects the larger fiscal 
stimulus package incorporated into the current staff forecast and the modest 
improvement in some financial markets ov er the intermeeting period.  As in the 
previous Bluebook, model-based estimates of short-run r* span a wide interval.  The 
estimate from the small structural model no w stands at -6.2 percent, about 50 basis

points lower than in December; this re vision mainly reflects the less favorable 
conditions in the stock market over the inte rmeeting period.  All of the measures of 
short-run r* except the single-equation estimate are well below the current level of the 
actual real federal funds rate. 
(35) Chart 8 depicts optimal control simula tions of the FRB/US model using the 
long-run staff forecast.7  For an inflation goal of eith er 1½ percent or 2 percent (left-
hand and right-hand sets of charts, resp ectively), the optimal control simulations 
prescribe a trajectory for the nominal federal funds rate that stays at or close to the lower bound from now through 2013.
8  Under either inflation goal, the 
unemployment rate rises for the current year to about 8½ percent and remains above the NAIRU through 2012; this path is similar to the one shown in the December 
Bluebook.  Core inflation in 2009 is a bit lower than in th e previous Bluebook, 
reflecting in part surprisi ngly low recent readings on consumer prices; however, 
inflation in 2010 and beyond is little chan ged from the previous Bluebook and runs 
somewhat below 1 percent.  (36) The optimal policy simulations assume that the Federal Reserve does not 
undertake additional liquidity and credit acti ons beyond those already incorporated in 
the staff’s baseline projection.  Howeve r, further economic stimulus could be 
provided by the implementation of nontradi tional policy actions b eyond those already 
announced, such as purchases of $500 billion in long-term Treasury securities and the 
$500 billion increase in purchases of agency MBS contemplated in the Greenbook 
alternative scenario, “Large-scale Asset Purchases.”  In this scenario, these actions are 
                                           
7 In these simulations, policymakers place equa l weight on keeping core PCE inflation close 
to a specified goal, on keepin g unemployment close to the NA IRU, and on avoiding changes 
in the nominal federal funds rate.  
8 These simulations, as well as the prescriptions of the policy rules shown in Chart 9, now 
impose a lower bound for the policy rate of 12.5  basis points, the midpoint of the FOMC’s 
current target range of 0 to ¼ percent. This value for the lower bound differs slightly from 
that in the previous Bluebook, wh ere it was set at 25 basis points.

assumed to induce reductions in long-ter m interest rates and changes in other 
financial conditions that significantly boost consumption and investment.9  As a 
result, real GDP in 2011 rises a percentage poi nt faster than in the baseline, while core 
PCE inflation settles in at a rate of about 1 percent over the next several years, about 
a quarter percentage point higher than in the baseline.10 
(37) As depicted in Chart 9, the outcome- based policy rule prescribes a funds 
rate that stays at the lower bound throug h 2011 before steadily rising to about 3 
percent by the end of 2013.  In contrast, th e trajectory of the funds rate consistent 
with financial market quotes is within the cu rrent target range only through the third 
quarter of this year before rising slowly, passing ½ percent by the beginning of 2010 
and reaching a plateau of about 2 percent starting in 2012.11  As can be seen by the 
confidence intervals in these two panels, investors appear to assign a lower probability 
to the federal funds rate rising above 1 pe rcent by the end of 2009 than is suggested 
by FRB/US simulations under the outcome-based rule.  As shown in the bottom panel of Chart 9, the near-term prescriptions from both the Taylor (1999) rule and the 
first-difference rule have now fallen to the effective lower bound, reflecting the current weakness of both economic activity an d inflation.  By contrast, the policy path

Unconventional Policies for Optimal Monetary Po licy” reflecting part of Note 21 included 
in the material on the zero bound that w as sent to the Committee on December 5.  
10 In the simulation, long-run inflation expectations respond to actual inflation and to any 
unexpected movements in the federal funds rate, but not to the asset purchases.  If wage and 
price setters took some signal for the likely long-run trend in inflation from the asset 
purchases as well, then actual infl ation would decline even less.  
11 The confidence intervals shown in the top right panel of Chart 9 are computed from 
interest rate caps and basis swaps with adjustments for term premiums.  The effects of 
alternative assumptions about term premiums on measures of expectations of future federal 
funds rates are presented in the Bluebook Box “Gauging Investor Expectations for Future 
Interest Rate Policy. ”

Policy Alternatives 
(38) This Bluebook presents three alternatives for the Committee’s 
consideration, summarized by the draft stat ements on the following pages.  All three 
alternatives maintain the target range for th e federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and 
indicate, as in the December statement, that the funds rate is likely to remain 
exceptionally low for some time.  All three alternatives again state that the primary 
focus of the Committee’s policy is to support  the functioning of financial markets and 
stimulate the economy through open market operations and other measures that are 
likely to keep the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet at a high level, and they 
all mention the imminent implementation of the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan 
Facility (TALF) as one example of such polic ies.  All of the alternatives indicate that 
“The Committee will continue to monitor carefully the size and composition of the 
Federal Reserve’s balance sheet in light of  evolving financial market developments.” 
(39) The description of the economic outloo k in Alternative A highlights the 
weaker-than-expected incoming data, an d Alternatives A and B note that global 
demand is slowing significantly.  Alternativ es B and C state that the economic outlook 
“remains weak.”  Alternative A announces ei ther a $250 billion increase in the Federal 
Reserve’s commitment to purchase mortgage-backed securities or the establishment 
of a program to purchase $250 billion of longer-term Treasury securities.  Alternative A also highlights the risk that inflation could persist below levels consistent with the dual objectives of monetary policy; this  language might help underscore the 
Committee’s intent not to allo w inflation to remain below it s optimal level in the long 
run and thus may help prevent an unwanted further decline in expectations of long-
run inflation.  This sentence also may be seen as signaling th at the Committee would 
adopt further stimulative measures should infl ation continue to decline significantly.  
Alternative B states that the Committee is prepared to purchase longer-term Treasury securities or to increase purchases of  mortgage-backed securities, but makes no 
Class I FOMC--Restricted Controlled (FR)
37 of 52  
   
specific commitment on the timing or amount of such purchases.  Alternatives A and 
B state that the Committee will continue  to “assess whether expansions of or 
modifications to lending facilities would serve to further support credit markets and 
economic activity.”  Altern ative C omits all mention of  possible increases in open 
market purchases or liquidity programs other than the TALF.

December FOMC Statement 
The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to establish a target range for the federal funds 
rate of 0 to 1/4 percent.   Since the Committee's last meeting, labor market condit ions have deteriorated, and the available data 
indicate that consumer spending, business investment, and industrial production have declined.  
Financial markets remain quite strained and credit  conditions tight.  Overall, the outlook for 
economic activity has weakened further.  Meanwhile, inflationary pressures have diminished appr eciably.  In light of the declines in the prices 
of energy and other commodities and the weaker prospects for economic activity, the Committee expects inflation to moderate further in coming quarters.  The Federal Reserve will employ all available tools to promote the resumption of sustainable 
economic growth and to preserve price stability.  In particular, the Committee anticipates that weak 
economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for some time.   The focus of the Committee's policy going forward will be to support the functioning of financial 
markets and stimulate the economy through open ma rket operations and other measures that sustain 
the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet at a high level.  As previously announced, over the 
next few quarters the Federal Reserve will purchase large quantities of agency debt and mortgage-backed securities to provide support to the mortgage and housing markets, and it stands ready to expand its purchases of agency debt and mortgage -backed securities as conditions warrant.  The 
Committee is also evaluating the potential benefits of purchasing longer-term Treasury securities.  
Early next year, the Federal Reserve will also im plement the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan 
Facility to facilitate the extension of credit to ho useholds and small businesses.  The Federal Reserve 
will continue to consider ways of using its ba lance sheet to further support credit markets and 
economic activity.

 Alternative A 
1.  The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target range for the federal funds 
rate at 0 to 1/4 percent.  The Committee continues to anticipate that economic conditions are likely 
to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for some time.    2.  Information received since the Committee met in December suggests that the economy has 
weakened somewhat more than anticipated.  Indust rial production, housing starts, and employment 
have declined steeply, as consumers and businesse s have cut back spending.  Furthermore, global 
demand appears to be slowing significantly.  Condit ions in some financial markets have improved, in 
part reflecting government efforts to provide liquidity and strengthen financial institutions; nevertheless, credit conditions for households and firms remain extremely tight.  The Committee 
anticipates that a gradual recovery in economic ac tivity will begin later this year, but the downside 
risks to that outlook are sizable.  3.  In light of the declines in the prices of en ergy and other commodities in recent months and the 
prospects for an extended period of economic slac k, the Committee expects that inflation pressures 
will remain subdued.  Moreover, the Committee sees some risk that inflation could persist for a time below rates that best foster economic growth  and price stability in the longer term.  
 4. The Federal Reserve will employ all available tools to promote the resumption of sustainable 
economic growth and to preserve price stability.  The focus of the Committee’s policy is to support 
the functioning of financial markets and stimulate the economy through ope n market operations and 
other measures that are likely to keep the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet at a high level.   
 [Alt. 1: To provide further support to activity in housing markets, the Committee decided to expand its purchases of agency mortgage-backed securities  to $750 billion this year from its previously 
announced total of $500 billion.  The Committee anti cipates completing these purchases by the end 
of the third quarter.  The Committee also is prepared  to purchase longer-term Treasury securities as 
needed to improve overall financial conditions.]    [Alt. 2: To help improve overall financial conditions, the Committee decided to purchase up to $250 billion of longer-term Treasury securities this year.  The Federal Reserve cont inues to purchase large 
quantities of agency debt and mort gage-backed securities to provide support to the mortgage and 
housing markets, and it stands ready to expand such purchases as conditions warrant.]    Next month, the Federal Reserve will implement the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility to 
facilitate the extension of credit to households and small businesses.  The Committee will continue to monitor carefully the size and composition of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet in light of evolving financial market developments and to a ssess whether expansions of or modifications to 
lending facilities would serve to further support credit markets and economic activity.

(40) If the Committee agrees that current economic conditions are very weak but 
suspects that there is a significant possibilit y that policy actions already announced or 
likely to be adopted will have a larger eff ect on economic activity than is assumed in 
the staff’s forecast, it may wish to choose Alternative B .  In many ways, the current 
circumstances are unprecedented, and we lack reliable metrics for gauging the 
effectiveness of nontraditional policies.  In light of the aggressive monetary actions 
already taken or announced and the large fisc al package likely to be passed, members 
may believe that it is prudent at this stage to wait and assess further developments 
before committing the Federal Reserve to any additional actions.  In particular, members may wish to observe the market reaction to the implementation of the 
TALF, planned for next month.  Moreover, the incoming administration may move rapidly to ramp up efforts to deal with the financial crisis, and the Committee will be 
better placed to assess these efforts in a few weeks.  Alternatively, members may be 
concerned about the challenges of exiting from measures already adopted, and thus 
may wish to be quite cautious in implemen ting further liquidity programs.  At the 
same time, given that the forecasts of the staff and most private analysts imply that 
additional macroeconomic stimulus would be desirable, the Committee may not want 
to signal a halt to further monetary acti ons.  Alternative B states that additional 
actions will be taken as needed, and so would allow the Committee to introduce new policies quickly if it concluded that they were appropriate. (41) If the Committee shares the staff’s assessment that policies already 
announced or expected will not suffice to prevent considerable economic slack and a 
heightened risk of deflation, and if it believes that additional policy measures could 
help to improve the economic outlook, it may opt for Alternative A .  The output gap 
in the Greenbook remains larger than 5 percent over the next two years and core inflation falls below 1 percent, which is lower than the rates of inflation that most 
Class I FOMC--Restricted Controlled (FR)
43 of 52  
   
FOMC participants would view as consis tent with the Federal Reserve’s dual 
mandate.  Most private-sector analysts have marked up their forecasts for the 
unemployment rate in 2009 and 2010 to leve ls about the same as projected by the 
staff, and they forecast relatively low rates of inflation, albeit not as low as the staff.  
Even if members have a less gloomy ou tlook for the economy, they may view the 
downside risks to this outlook as unusua lly large and thus may wish to take out 
“insurance” against an unwelcome further weak ening in growth or drop in inflation.  
The significant decline in long-term interest rates, including conventional mortgage rates, since the Federal Reserve announced plans to purchase agency debt and MBS 
may give policymakers confidence that nontr aditional policies can provide significant 
economic stimulus.  As a result, the Commi ttee may conclude that an expansion of 
these purchases would likely lead to further reductions in rates and increases in mortgage availability.  Or, if the level of long-term interest rates is seen as higher than 
is consistent with a rapid economic recove ry, the Committee may wish to engage in 
large-scale purchases of long-term Treasury securities.  By lowering the general level 
of long-term interest rates, either of  these options could support business and 
household spending. (42) If the Committee has a relatively optimistic view of the underlying 
economic situation and outlook, it may be inclined to favor Alternative C .  Members 
may anticipate a more rapid unwinding of fi nancial strains than assumed by the staff, 
leading to a more pronounced rebound in activity (as in the “Faster Recovery” 
alternative scenario in the Greenbook).  Such  an outcome might be the result of a new 
and aggressive approach by the incoming  administration to the ongoing financial 
crisis.  Alternatively, members may believe that the monetary policies and liquidity facilities that already have been implem ented or announced will provide greater 
stimulus to economic activity than is built  into the staff forecast.  Similarly, the 
Committee may have a larger estimate of the fi scal multiplier than that assumed by the 
Class I FOMC--Restricted Controlled (FR)
44 of 52  
   
staff in its analysis of the likely effects of the fiscal stimulus pack age.  Finally, as in 
Alternative B, the Committee may be concerned that exiting from the existing 
facilities could prove challenging and prefer not to take the risk of adding to such 
difficulties.  Indeed, if the public came to  view the expansion of the Federal Reserve 
balance sheet as implying a permanent in crease in the monetary base, inflation 
expectations could increase, and inflation risk  premiums in financial assets might rise 
in a destabilizing manner.  The language in  Alternative C makes clear that existing 
Federal Reserve policies and programs are vi ewed by the Committee as helpful, but it 
does not hint at any expansion of existing programs or the introduction of new 
programs.   (43) Based on interest rate futures contracts and on the Desk’s survey of dealers, 
market participants attach virtually no probability to a change in the target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting.  Dealers generally expect the statement to 
continue to refer to the funds rate remaining low for some time and to focus on the Federal Reserve’s nontraditional policy tools.  On average, dealers place the odds of 
large-scale Federal Reserve purchases of long-term Treasury securities at about 50 percent, with no time horizon specified for the onset of such purchases.  Although 
market expectations for the statement overa ll are difficult to judge, the message of 
Alternative B seems most consiste nt with current market views. 
Money and Debt Forecasts 
(44) Bank credit is forecasted to grow at  a sluggish 2¼ per cent pace in 2009.  
Relatively tight credit standards and term s and weak loan demand are expected to 
persist, and each category of core loans on banks' books—commercial and industrial, 
real estate, and consumer—are projected to be nearly flat.  In contrast, securities 
holdings are expected to expand moderately  this year, as banks continue to park 
deposits and other sources of funds in safe  and liquid investments.  In 2010, when 
Class I FOMC--Restricted Controlled (FR)
45 of 52  
   
GDP growth is projected to pick up and th e effect of tighter lending standards and 
terms wanes, bank credit grows around 5 percent, mainly owing to increases in real 
estate and consumer loans as well as continued expansion of securities.   
(45) Amid sharply curtailed credit availabi lity, household debt is expected to 
decline about 1 percent in 2009 and to ri se at a modest pace in 2010 as credit 
constraints ease only gradually.  Even though overall credit conditions are expected to 
improve over time, nonfinancial business debt  will likely expand at a weak pace next 
year and in 2010, as capital spending remains sluggish.  Federal debt, which surged in the second half of 2008 because of government programs aimed at ameliorating financial market strains, is anticipated to continue to grow at a rapid pace throughout the forecast period, reflecting the fiscal package and continued outlays to support 
financial institutions and markets.  Overa ll, total domestic nonfinancial debt is 
projected to expand 5 percent in  2009 and 4¾ percent in 2010. 
(46) M2 is projected to grow at a 3 percent annual rate this year, somewhat faster 
than the projected growth rate of nominal GDP, reflecting the lagged effects of recent 
declines in the opportunity cost of holding  M2 assets.  In 2010,  money growth is 
expected to align roughly with growth in nominal GDP as these lagged effects 
subside.

(47) Draft language for the dir ective is provided below. 
Directive Wording 
Alternative A1:   The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and 
financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable 
growth in output.  To further its long-run objectives, the Committee seeks 
conditions in reserve markets consistent  with federal funds trading in a range 
from 0 to ¼ percent.  The Committee directs the Desk to purchase GSE debt 
and agency-guaranteed MBS during the intermeeting period with the aim of 
providing support to the mortgage and housing markets.  The timing and pace 
of these purchases should depend on conditions in the markets for such 
securities and on a broader assessment of conditions in primary mortgage 
markets and the housing sector.  By the end of the third quarter of this year the Desk is expected to purchase up to $ 100 billion in housing-related GSE debt 
and up to $750 billion in agency-guara nteed MBS.  The System Open Market 
Account Manager and the Secretary wi ll keep the Committ ee informed of 
ongoing developments regarding the System’s balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the Committee’s objectives of maximum 
employment and price stability.

providing support to the mortgage and housing markets.  The timing and pace 
of these purchases should depend on conditions in the markets for such 
securities and on a broader assessment of conditions in primary mortgage 
markets and the housing sector.  By the en d of the second quarter of this year, 
the Desk is expected to purchase up to $100 billion in housing-related GSE 
debt and up to $500 billion in agency-guaranteed MBS.  The Committee also directs the Desk to purchase long-term Treasury securities during the 
intermeeting period.  By the end of the se cond quarter of this year, the Desk is 
expected to purchase up to $250 billion of long-term Treasury securities, with 
the aim of improving overall financial conditions.  The System Open Market 
Account Manager and the Secretary wi ll keep the Committ ee informed of 
ongoing developments regarding the System’s balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the Committee’s objectives of maximum

   Appendix A: Measures of the  Equilibrium Real Rate 
The equilibrium
 real rate is the real  federal funds rate that, if maintained, would be projected to return 
output to its potential level over time.   The short-run equilibrium rate is  defined as the rate that would 
close the output gap in twelve qua rters given the corresponding model’s projection of the economy.   
The medium-run concept is the value of  the real federal funds rate proj ected to keep ou tput at potential 
in seven years, under the assumption that monetary policy acts to bring actua l and potential output into 
line in the short run and then keeps them equal thereafter.  The TIPS-based factor model measure 
provides an estimate of market expectations for the real federal funds rate seven years ahead.  
 The actual real federal funds rate is  constructed as the difference betw een the nominal rate and realized 
inflation, where the nominal rate is measured as the quarterly average of the observed federal funds rate, 
and realized inflation is given by the log difference between the co re PCE price index and its lagged 
value four quarters earlier.  For th e current quarter, the nominal rate is specified as the target federal 
funds rate on the Bluebook publication date.  For the current quarter and th e previous quarter, the 
inflation rate is computed using the staff’s estimat e of the core PCE price i ndex. If the upcoming FOMC 
meeting falls early in the quarter, the lagged in flation measure ends in the last quarter.   
 Confidence intervals reflect uncertainties about model specification, coefficients, and the level of 
potential output.  The final column of the table in dicates the values published in the previous Bluebook. 
Measure Description 
Single-equation 
Model  The measure of the equilibrium real rate in the single-equation model is based on an 
estimated aggregate-demand relationship between  the current value of the output gap and 
its lagged values as well as the lagged va lues of the real federal funds rate. 
Small Structural 
Model  The small-scale model of the economy consists  of equations for six variables: the output 
gap, the equity premium, the federal budget surp lus, the trend growth rate of output, the 
real bond yield, and the real federal funds rate. 
Large Model 
(FRB/US) Estimates of the equilibrium real rate using FRB/US—the staff’s large-scale econometric 
model of the U.S. economy—depend on a very broad array of economic factors, some of 
which take the form of projected valu es of the model’s exogenous variables. 
Greenbook-
consistent  The FRB/US model is used in conjunction with an extended version of the Greenbook 
forecast to derive a Greenbook-consistent measure .  FRB/US is first add-factored so that 
its simulation matches the extended Greenbook forecast, and then a second simulation is 
run off this baseline to determine the value of the real federal funds rate that closes the 
output gap. 
TIPS-based 
Factor Model Yields on TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) reflect investors’ expectations of the future path of real interest rates, but also include term and liquidity premiums.  The 
TIPS-based measure of the equilibrium real ra te is constructed using the seven-year-ahead 
instantaneous real forward rate derived fro m TIPS yields as of the Bluebook publication 
date.  This forward rate is adjusted to remove estimates of the term and liquidity 
premiums based on a three-factor arbitrage -free term-structure model applied to TIPS 
yields, nominal yields, and inflation.  Because TIPS indexation is based on the total CPI, 
this measure is also adjusted for the me dium-term difference—projected at 40 basis 
points—between total CPI inflation and core PCE inflation.

Appendix A: Measures of the Equ ilibrium Real Rate (continued) 
 
 
 Estimates of the real federal funds rate depend on the proxies for expected in flation used.  The table 
below shows estimated real federal funds rates base d on lagged core PCE infl ation, the definition used 
in the Equilibrium Real Federal Funds Rate char t; lagged four-quarter head line PCE inflation; and 
projected four-quarter headline PCE inflation beginning with the next quar ter.  For each estimate of the 
real rate, the table also provides the Greenbook-consistent measure of th e short-run equilibrium real rate 
and the average actual real federal funds rate over the next twelve quarters.

:  For the following rules, it denotes the federal funds rate for quarter t , while  
the explanatory variables include the staff’s projec tion of trailing four-quart er core PCE inflation ( πt), 
inflation two and three quarters ahead ( πt+2|t and π t+3|t), the output gap in the current period and one 
quarter ahead (*

1| 1|tt ttyy++− ), and the three-quarter-ahead forecast of annual average GDP 
growth relative to potential (44*
3| 3| tt ttyy++Δ− Δ ), and *π denotes an assumed value of policymakers’ 
long-run inflation objective.  The outcome-based a nd forecast-based rules were estimated using real-
time data over the sample 1988:1-2006:4; each specifi cation was chosen using the Bayesian information 
criterion. Each rule incorporates a 75 basis point shift in the interc ept, specified as a sequence of  
25 basis point increments during the first three quarters of 1998.  The first two simple rules were 
proposed by Taylor (1993, 1999).  The prescriptions  of the first-difference rule do not depend on 
assumptions regarding r*  or the level of the outpu t gap; see Orphanides (2003)

FRB/US Model Simulations :  Prescriptions from the two empiri cal rules are computed using dynamic 
simulations of the FRB/US model, implemented as though the rule were followed starting at this FOMC 
meeting.  The dotted line labeled “Previous Bluebook” is  based on the current specification of the policy 
rule, applied to the previous Gr eenbook projection.  Confidence intervals are based on stochastic 
simulations of the FRB/US model with shocks drawn from the estimated residuals over 1986-2005.  
Information from Financial Markets :  The expected funds rate path is based on forward rate 
agreements, and the confidence intervals for this path are constructed using prices of interest rate caps. 
Near-Term Prescriptions of Simple Policy Rules :  These prescriptions are calculated using Greenbook 
projections for inflation and the output gap. Because the first-difference rule involves the lagged funds 
rate, the value labeled “Previous Bluebook” for the curr ent quarter is computed using the actual value  
of the lagged funds rate, and the one -quarter-ahead prescriptions are ba sed on this rule’s prescription for 
the current quarter.
