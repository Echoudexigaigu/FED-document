SUMMARY 
Conditions in financial markets showed some limited signs of improvement over 
the intermeeting period.  Investor concerns about financial institutions appeared to 
ease somewhat, with a number of major banking organizations posting better-than-
expected first-quarter earnings results.  An index of bank equity prices rose notably, 
outperforming broad equity indexes, although  credit default swap (CDS) spreads for 
large banking organizations were little change d, on net, at elevated levels.  Rates on 
short-term funding instruments generally ed ged lower, and functioning in markets for 
these instruments improved.  Nevertheless, market participants appear to remain 
concerned about the methodology and resu lts of the stress tests for banks and 
potential policy responses to the results. 
Yields on nominal Treasury securities decreased modestly, on net, over the 
intermeeting period.  Yields dropped appr eciably following the FOMC announcement 
on March 18 that the Federal Reserve would purchase up to $300 billion of longer-
term Treasury securities and increase its purchases of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities, but yields subse quently retraced a significant portion of 
that drop amid a perceived improvement in  the economic outlook and perhaps some 
reversal of flight-to-quality flows.  Yields  on corporate bonds fell a bit more than 
those on comparable-maturity Treasury s ecurities, leaving risk spreads a little 
narrower, though still very elevated.  Other risk spreads also narrowed somewhat, 
although they remained high relative to thei r historical ranges.  Rates on mortgages in 
the primary and secondary markets declined over the intermeeting period, benefiting 
from the announced expansion of Federal Reserve large scale asset purchases.   
Despite the lower interest rates, net private sector debt appears to have contracted 
in the first quarter.  Bond issuance by nonfinancial corporations has been robust, but 
much of the proceeds have b een used to pay down short-term borrowing.  Residential 
mortgage applications have picked up.  This increase appears to largely reflect 
refinancing activity, and mortgage debt is pr ojected to contract in the first quarter.  
Results from the April Senior Loan Of ficer Opinion Survey indicated a further 
tightening of banks’ lending policies and a further weakening of demand for loans from both businesses and households.   
A number of central banks in both developed and emerging economies eased 
monetary policy over the intermeeting period.  Prices in foreign stock markets surged, 
especially those for bank stocks, amid a ge neral improvement in investor sentiment 
and some reports of better-than-expected performance from financial firms in the 
United States and Europe.  Sovereign bond  yields in advanced economies generally 
rose, and the dollar declined against most major currencies. 
FINANCIAL  INSTITUTIONS  
Concern about the health of U.S. financial institutions appeared to abate 
somewhat, on net, over the intermeeting period.  An index of bank equity prices 
increased about 20 percent, reflecting in  part better-than-expected first-quarter 
earnings results at some large banking organizations (Chart 1).  The prices of preferred equity of large bank  holding companies also rose significantly.  Nonetheless, 
concerns about the condition of banks persis ted.  Earnings statements generally noted 
heavy provisioning for loan losses, causin g some smaller banking organizations to 
post losses in the first quarter.  CDS spreads for large bank holding companies and for other banks remained elevated.  Rating agencies lowered credit ratings for Wells Fargo and Bank of America on March 25.  In vestors continue to be uncertain about 
the methodology being used in the stress tests of large banking organizations; the

results of those tests, which will be rele ased in early May; and the likely policy 
responses.1  On April 2, FASB voted to modify the rules related to fair value 
accounting for illiquid assets and “other than temporary impairments.”2  These 
changes were reportedly seen as benefiting financial institutions, but some market 
participants have raised concerns that the changes could reduce transparency in the financial sector.  Market participants were also concerned about the potential influence of the accounting rule changes on banks’ reported earnings.  A few small 
banks began repaying the capital injections  received through the TARP program, and 
Goldman Sachs announced its intention to use the funds from its $5 billion April 14 
equity offering to do the same.  Concerns  regarding the capital position of insurance 
companies appeared to diminish following market reports that some insurance 
companies would be eligible to receive TARP funds.  Insurance company equity 
prices rose about 25 percent, but CDS sp reads for these institutions were little 
changed on net. 
During the intermeeting period, the Trea sury announced details regarding the 
public-private investment partnership (PPIP) program to purchase legacy assets from financial institutions.  This announcement was initially well received by market 
                                           
1 A white paper describing the assumptions unde rlying the stress tests and the methodology 
used to implement the tests will be release d April 24.  
2 The new fair value guidance for illiquid assets reduces the emphasis that should be placed 
on the “last transaction price” in valuin g assets when markets are not active and 
transactions are likely to be forced or di stressed.  The new guidance for other-than-
temporary-impairments will require that only the credit-related portion of a debt security’s 
fair value impairment—the difference between th e present value of the expected cash flows 
and the amortized cost basis—be written-down  through earnings when two criteria are 
met: the institution does not have the intent to sell the debt security and it is unlikely that 
the institution will be required to sell the debt security before a forecasted recovery of its value.  In the event the two criteria are not met, the full impairment—the difference between the security’s amortized cost basis and its fair value—must be written-down 
through earnings.

participants.  Of late, however, market uncertainty about the efficacy of government 
support to the financial sector has increased, as investors have reportedly become more hesitant to participate in some gove rnment programs as a result of concerns 
about risk coming from political pressures such as possible disclosure of program use 
or restrictions on their hiring and compen sation practices.  Some market participants 
are also said to be concerned that the Le gacy Loans Program portion of the PPIP will 
attract few sellers, as they believe the di fference between current market values of 
eligible assets and those reflected on banks’ books to be quite large. 
Issuance of banking organization senior  obligations guaranteed by the FDIC 
under the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Pr ogram (TLGP) totaled about $25 billion 
over the intermeeting period.  Spreads of yields on securities issued under this 
program to those on comparable-maturity Tr easuries generally moved down over the 
intermeeting period.  On April 1, TLGP fees were increased and both the issuance 
and guarantee periods were extended.
3  On April 6, Standard and Poor's announced 
that it will no longer automatically assign  an A-1+ rating to all short-term FDIC-
guaranteed debt owing to the rating agency's concerns about the timeliness of 
repayment in the event of default.  This rati ng action does not appear to have had any 
notable effect to date.  
MARKET FUNCTIONING  
Functioning in many financial markets impr oved over the period.  Conditions in 
short-term bank funding markets improved somewhat, with reports that the volume 
of lending had generally risen.  Libor fixi ngs (and spreads over OIS) inched down, 
                                           
3 Changes to the FDIC program included an incr ease in guarantee fees for debt with a one-
year maturity or longer, with insured deposito ry institutions having smaller fee increases 
than holding companies; an extension of th e period for which FDIC-guaranteed debt can 
be issued to the end of October 2009; and an extension of the end date for the guarantees 
under the program from June 30, 2012, to year-end 2012.

perhaps reflecting in part reduced concerns a bout counterparty credit risk (Chart 2).  
Even so, Libor-to-OIS spreads remain elevated, especially at maturities beyond one 
month.  Consistent with some easing of conditions in bank funding markets, amounts 
bid in the TAF auctions conducted over the period were below the levels seen earlier 
this year, and primary credit outstanding fe ll about $25 billion, to $45 billion.  
Overnight general collateral repo rates ha ve also edged down recently, converging 
toward the federal funds rate, and the volu me of longer-maturity repo transactions 
reportedly increased.  Median bid-asked sp reads for repo transactions involving most 
types of collateral were little changed, al though bid-asked spreads for transactions 
involving agency MBS declined a bit.  Delivery fails on Tr easury securities remained 
low despite the low level of interest rate s.  Consistent with steady or improving 
conditions in the term repo market, the amo unt of loans outstanding under the TSLF 
program continued to decline, and the last  two TSLF auctions involving Schedule 1 
collateral received no bids.4  During the intermeeting period, the New York Fed 
increased the regular SOMA securities le nding program minimum rate from 1 basis 
point to 5 basis points in view of improved market functioning. 
Spreads on both AA-rated asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) and A2/P2-
rated commercial paper (CP) moved down a bit further.  The amount of nonfinancial 
CP and ABCP outstanding declined over the intermeeting period, in part because 
firms substituted longer-term funding and also because overall demand for financing 
diminished.  Financial CP outstanding edged up, on net, over the past several weeks.  
Credit extended under the CPFF held steady  over the intermeeting period at about 
$240 billion, while credit extended under the AMLF continued to decline, reaching a 
level of just $1 billion.5  Nonetheless, market participants reportedly continue to view 
                                           
4 Two dealers terminated TSLF loans early ow ing to concerns regarding political risks. 
5 During the week starting April 27, about $1 50 billion in CP at the CPFF will mature.

the Federal Reserve programs related to  the CP market as providing important 
support. 
Functioning in the Treasury market also improved over the intermeeting period, 
reportedly owing in part to the Federal Reserve’s open market purchases.  Spreads 
between the yields on on-the-run and off-the- run notes have narrowed significantly, 
although they remain wide.  Similarly, fitting errors from st aff yield-curve models have 
diminished, although they remain large.  Average bid-asked spreads for on-the-run 
Treasury notes were relatively stable at  pre-Lehman levels.  Nevertheless, trading 
volumes remained low by historical standards, despite considerable issuance.   
Indicators of functioning in the co rporate bond market—such as bid-asked 
spreads estimated by the staff—suggest that conditions in the speculative-grade 
segment of the market continued to be strain ed, although they improved relative to 
the fall of last year.  Similarly, the le veraged loan market showed some improvement 
over the last few months, with the aver age bid-asked spread narrowing and the 
average bid price moving up some from ve ry depressed levels.  In the CDS market, 
changes were introduced on April 8 to reduce counterparty risk and improve 
operational efficiency by making trades more  standardized and fungible, with the 
intent of facilitating the movement to wards central clearing.  Prior to the 
implementation of these changes, liquidity in  the CDS market reportedly had declined.  
However, no significant disruption was reporte d following the changes and liquidity is 
said to have returned to recent norms.  The basis between the CDX Investment 
Grade index of CDS spreads and measures of investment-grade corporate spreads—a rough proxy for unexploited arbitrage opportunities in the corporate market—remained at high levels, due to an ongoing la ck of financing capacity at major financial 
institutions.

MONETARY  POLICY  EXPECTATIONS  AND TREASURY  YIELDS 
The Committee’s decision at the March meeting to leave the target range for the 
federal funds rate unchanged was widely anticipated.6  However, investors were 
apparently surprised by the FOMC’s a nnouncement that it would increase 
significantly further the size of the Federa l Reserve’s balance sheet by purchasing up 
to $300 billion in Treasury securities an d expanding purchases of agency MBS and 
agency debt by up to $750 and $100 billion, respectively.  (See box entitled “Balance 
Sheet Developments During the Interm eeting Period.”)  In addition, market 
participants reportedly interpreted the statement that the federal funds rates was likely 
to remain exceptionally low for “an extended pe riod” as stronger than the phrase “for 
some time” in the previous statement.  Fo llowing the release of the FOMC statement, 
rates on Eurodollar futures contracts and yi elds on Treasury, agency, and mortgage-
backed securities all fell considerably.7  The initial decline in the path for the federal 
funds rate implied by futures rates was subs equently reversed, perhaps in response to 
the modest improvement in the economic outlook (Chart 3).  Based on our standard 
term premium assumption of 1 basis point  per month, market quotes currently 
suggest that market participants anticipate that the FOMC will start to raise the 
federal funds rate around the end of 2009.  However, staff models suggest that term premiums could well be higher than usual,  implying a flatter path for the expected 
federal funds rate.  Only four respondents  to the Desk’s survey of primary dealers 
expect the target federal funds rate to be ra ised before the third quarter of 2010, with 
                                           
6 Two other notable announcements regarding Federal Reserve monetary policy were made 
during the intermeeting period.  On March 23, the Federal Reserve and the Treasury 
announced an accord regarding the appropria te roles of the Federal Reserve and the 
Treasury to preserve financia l and monetary stability.  On April 6, the Federal Reserve 
announced that it had entered into currency sw ap arrangements with several foreign central 
banks that would enable the Federal Reserve to  provide liquidity in foreign currencies.  
Neither announcement appeared to prompt any market reaction.

Balance Sheet Developments  During the Intermeeting  Period 
Since the March FOMC meeting, the Fe deral Reserve’s total assets have 
expanded by about $130 billio n to around $2,200 billion.1  The expansion primarily 
reflected an increase of $215 billion in securities held  outright; the Open Market 
Desk purchased $139 billion in agency mortgage-backed securities, $60 billion in 
U.S. Treasury securities, and $17 billion in agency securities.2  The purchases of 
agency mortgage-backed securities have been concentrated in newly issued 30-year MBS, while the purchases of U.S. Treasu ry and agency securities have been 
concentrated in maturities of less than seven years and less than five years, respectively.  In addition, the Term Asset- Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF) 
conducted its first two operations: The TALF lent roughly $6 billion to finance the 
issuance of asset-backed securities collateralized by auto and credit card loans; prior 
to these operations, there had been no sign ificant issuance of these classes of ABS 
since last summer.   
The effect of the System’s securities pu rchases on total assets was damped by a 
decline in lending through liquidity progra ms for financial firms.  Foreign central 
bank liquidity swaps declined $47 billi on; the sum of primary, secondary, and 
seasonal credit declined $25 billion; term auction credit declined $13 billion; and 
primary dealer and other broker-dea ler credit declined $12 billion.
3  The runoff in 
credit provided under these facilities refl ected in part improvement in short-term 
funding markets, with market participants  noting that rates have declined and 
lending volumes have increased in term bank funding and repurchase agreement 
markets.  Securities lent through the Term Securities Lending Facility, which do not affect assets because the Federal Reserve reta ins ownership, declined  by $62 billion.  
Dealers reduced or stopped their use of this facility for a number of reasons, including the improved market conditions , continued deleveraging, and concerns 
about government restrictions on program participants. 
On the liab
ility side of the Federal Re serve’s balance sheet, the expansion was 
reflected primarily in a sharp increase of  $145 billion in the reserve balances of 
depository institutions.  The U.S. Trea sury’s General Account remained elevated 
and quite volatile during the intermeeting period due to inflows of corporate and 
personal tax receipts, but it declined $15 billion, on net.  The Supplementary 
Financing Account remained unchanged at $200 billion ov er the period.

half of the respondents anticipating the first rate increase to occur during or after the 
first quarter of 2011, roughly the same as in  the last survey.  The primary dealers also 
placed small but non-negligible odds on the Committee modestly increasing the scale 
of asset purchases over the next few meetings.    
Immediately following the FOMC announc ement, yields on two- and ten-year 
nominal Treasury securities dropped abou t 20 and 40 basis points, respectively.  A 
portion of these initial declines was retr aced over the intermeeting period amid a 
perceived improvement in the economic ou tlook, the abatement of concern about 
financial institutions, continued strong Trea sury issuance, and perhaps some reversal 
of flight-to-quality flows.  Yields on both two- and ten-year nominal Treasury securities ended the period down about 15 basis points.  Implied volatility on long-
term Treasury yields decreased substantia lly following the FOMC meeting, and staff 
estimates of term premiums also moved do wn.  Spreads between the yields on agency 
debt securities and those on comparable maturity Treasuries narrowed at shorter 
maturities but were little changed at longer horizons. 
Yields on inflation-indexed Treasury securi ties fell a bit more than those on their 
nominal counterparts, especially at the fi ve-year horizon.  As a result, five-year 
inflation compensation rose about 0.3 percen t to 0.4 percent, po ssibly owing in part 
to an increase in energy prices.  Five-year inflation compensation five years ahead was 
little changed over the intermeeting period at  around 2.5 percent.  Although it has 
improved of late, poor liquidity in the TIPS market continued to make these readings 
difficult to interpret.  Near-term inflation expectations from the Michigan survey also 
jumped, but long-term expectations edge d down.  The primary dealers’ median 
forecast for core PCE inflation was marked up slightly in 2009 to 1 percent, but 
revised down somewhat to 0.5 percent in 2010.

CAPITAL MARKETS 
Broad stock price indexes rose notably, on balance, over the intermeeting period, 
with the Dow Jones U.S. Total Stock Market Index (formerly the Wilshire 5000) up 
about 10 percent (Chart 4).  However, even  after this increase, this index is down 
about 5 percent for the year.  Implied vola tility in the S&P 500 continued to decline 
from the exceptionally high levels of last fall, but it remains qu ite elevated.  Early 
earnings reports from S&P 500 firms combin ed with analyst estimates suggest that 
earnings declined about 40 percent in the first quarter relative to the year-earlier 
period.  With the rise in equity prices and downward revisions to the outlook for 
corporate earnings, the difference between the forward trend earning-price ratio and 
an estimate of the real long-run Treasury  yield—a rough proxy for the equity risk 
premium—has declined but remains extremely high.   
In the corporate bond market, yields and spreads to comparable-maturity 
Treasury securities moved down over th e intermeeting period, with the decline 
particularly pronounced for below-investment grade firms.  Nevertheless, risk spreads for both investment-grade and speculative-gra de bonds stayed very high as investors 
reportedly continue to be concerned about credit quality deterioration and perhaps 
also cautious about taking on additional risk .  Both investment- and speculative-grade 
CDX indexes declined over the intermeeting period.  Bond issuance by nonfinancial corporations remained extremely strong in  March.  Most of the recent issuance, 
however, has been by investment-grade firms, as these firms apparently acted to lock in longer-term financing.  Some of the proceeds from the bond issuance have 
reportedly been used to pay down bank lo ans and commercial paper.  In contrast, 
bond issuance by speculative-grade firms ha s been modest.  Issuance of leveraged 
loans in the first quarter of 2009 was extremely weak, down nearly 60 percent from the same period of last year; issuance of in stitutional loans totaled only $2 billion.

Indexes of CDS spreads on senior AAA-rated CMBS narrowed after the 
announcement of the PPIP and the expansion of the TALF to incl ude legacy assets.  
By contrast, indexes of CDS spreads on junior-AAA and lower-rated tranches of 
CMBS widened as the credit ratings of some  of these tranches were lowered owing to 
increased expected losses. 
The interest rate on 30-year fixed-rate conforming mortgages has continued its 
downward trend and is currently a bit below 5 percent, likely refl ecting in part the 
support provided to the mortgage market by the Federal Reserve through its 
purchases of agency debt and agency MBS.  The low mortgages rates have spurred an 
increase in refinancing activity.  Issuance of mortgage-backed securities by the GSEs 
picked up notably in February, but issuan ce of non-agency mortgage-backed securities 
has continued to be non-existent.  The consumer asset-backed securities (ABS) market also saw a pickup in issuance and decline in spreads.  These developments may 
owe in part to the implementation of the TALF program, where the first two 
subscriptions resulted in about $6.5 b illion in loans being extended; however, 
investors reportedly remain hesitant about participating in this program for some of 
the same reasons they are wary of the PPI P.  A few ABS deals were issued without 
Federal Reserve support, including one that was eligible for the TALF.  Perhaps 
reflecting in part the improvement in the secondary market, interest rates on 
consumer loans also generally moved down some. 
State and local governments continued to issue a moderate volume of long-term 
bonds, with higher-rated issuers accounting fo r the bulk of these offerings.  The ratio 
of yields on long-term municipal bonds to those on comparable-maturity Treasuries 
continues to be above historic norms.

FOREIGN DEVELOPMENTS  
Major foreign stock market indexes rose during the intermeeting period, 
apparently supported by improved market se ntiment and boosted by some reports of 
better-than-expected performance from fina ncial firms in the United States and 
Europe (Chart 5).  Banking sector shar e prices outperformed broad stock price 
indexes in Europe.  In the United Kingdom, Barclays and Standard Chartered Bank 
reported a strong start of the year.  Barcla ys also announced that  it had passed the 
FSA’s stress test, decreasing the odds that  the bank would participate in the U.K. 
government’s Asset Protection Scheme.  In contrast, the equity prices of Japanese banks changed little on balance amid worries  about the financial condition of some 
institutions.  Credit availability in interb ank and other wholesale markets continued to 
increase modestly in the wake of the opt imism that boosted equity markets, with 
Libor-to-OIS spreads in euros and sterling declining over the period.   
Long-term bond yields in the United Ki ngdom, Canada, and the euro area fell 
sharply after the FOMC announcement on Marc h 18 but have retraced their declines.  
On net, German and Canadian ten-year yields  changed little, while Japanese and U.K. 
ten-year yields increased 12 to 45 basis poi nts.  These moves in yields, which occurred 
despite the many central bank actions over the period to loosen monetary policy, 
reportedly were in response to reduced risk aversion, signs of incipient stabilization in 
the pace of economic contraction, and con cerns about heavy future supply.  In 
particular, U.K. gilt yields increased over  the period despite the Bank of England 
having purchased about £30 billion in gilts since the start of its quantitative easing 
program on March 11.  On April 8, th e European Central Bank cut its main 
refinancing rate 25 basis points to 1.25 perc ent, less than the ex pected 50 basis point 
cut, and deferred a decision regarding any use of unconventional policy tools to its next Governing Council meeting in May.  The Bank of Canada halved its key

overnight interest rate to 25 basis points and indicated that, although it does not 
anticipate it to be necessary, it would be re ady to purchase debt if the outlook of the 
economy worsened further.  Any specific moves would be announced in upcoming 
policy meetings.  The Bank of Japan left it s target for the call rate unchanged but 
expanded some non-traditional policy measures:  It increased the size of its monthly 
purchases of government bonds from ¥1.4 tr illion to ¥1.8 trillio n and it announced 
that it will expand its eligible collateral to include municipal debt.  Many central banks 
in emerging market economies have further eased monetary policy.  Market 
participants expect that foreign central banks will continue to ea se policy in 2009.  
The dollar depreciated sharply in the days following the March FOMC meeting 
and the smaller-than-expected rate cut by  the European Central Bank.  The major 
currencies index of the dollar decrease d on net about 1.5 percent during the 
intermeeting period, as depreciation versus the Canadian dollar, the yen, and sterling 
more than offset a modest appreciation against the euro.  The dollar index for other 
important trading partners decreased about 2 percent, as reduced risk aversion and the 
announcements by several developing eco nomies of agreements with the IMF on 
financing packages improved sentiment to wards those regions.  Mexico became the 
first country to seek an arrangement wi th the IMF under the newly established 
Flexible Credit Line, and it also drew on its liquidity arrangement with the Federal 
Reserve.  At its April meeting, the G-20 agreed to support a general allocation of 
SDRs equivalent to $250 billio n to increase global liquidity.

Private sector debt appears to have contract ed again in the first quarter.  The staff 
continues to estimate that household debt dropped at roughly the same pace in the

mortgage debt contracted again in the fi rst quarter, depressed by continued weak 
housing demand, falling house prices, an d writedowns of nonperforming loans.  
Consumer credit was essentially flat, on net,  in the first quarter despite the generally 
lower interest rates on consumer loans.  Nonfinancial business debt growth has been 
tepid as robust bond issuance was partly of fset by declines in commercial paper and 
bank loans.  Amid the ongoing heavy debt issuance by the Treasury, federal debt grew 
at a more than 20 percent rate in the first quarter. 
Commercial bank credit is estimated to have  contracted again in March and April.  
The weakness in bank credit owes importantly  to a drop in loans to businesses, as 
C&I loans fell almost 13 percent at an a nnual rate in March, reflecting in part 
paydowns with the proceeds of bond issuance.  Commercial real estate loans declined 
almost 2 percent.  The run-off in business loans appears to be continuing in April.  
Bank lending to households was also weak in  the spring.  Owing to considerable sales 
of single-family mortgages to the GSEs, residential mortgage loans on banks’ books 
declined, on balance, in March and the first part of April.  Consumer loans held by 
banks also ran off amid heavy securitization .  In contrast, credit extended under 
revolving home equity lines of credit cont inued to expand at a robust pace, partly 
reflecting relatively attractive terms on existing lines. 
The Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices conducted 
in April indicated that banks continued to tighten their credit standards and terms on 
all major loan categories over the past th ree months.  The net fraction of banks that 
reported tightening their business lending policies, while still elevated, edged down for 
the second consecutive survey.  In contrast , somewhat larger net percentages of banks 
reported having tightened credit standards on residential mortgages than in the January survey.  Banks also reported a furt her tightening of standards and terms on 
credit cards and other consumer loans.  A large majority of respondents cited a less

favorable or more uncertain economic outlook, a worsening of industry-specific 
problems, and a reduced tolerance for risk as  important reasons for the move toward 
a more stringent lending posture.  In a set of special questions, large majorities of 
domestic and foreign respondents indicated th at they expect credit quality for all types 
of business and household loans to worsen in  2009.  Large net fractions of banks also 
reported a further weakening of demand for most types of loans, with the notable 
exception of residential mortgages to prime borrowers where demand was reported to 
have increased.   
M2 grew at a rapid clip in March despite the weakness in nominal income.  
Growth was boosted a few percentage points by large deposits in late February and early March at one commercial bank that were made by a corporate customer in anticipation of executing a take-over bid.  Robust expansion in liquid deposits more 
than accounted for the rise in M2 and was li kely fueled by a continued reallocation by 
households toward safer assets.  Retail mo ney market funds and small time deposits 
contracted in March, probably as a result of the continued decline in rates paid on 
these assets.  Growth of currency was bris k in March, apparently reflecting strong 
foreign and domestic demand.  Consiste nt with the expans ion of the Federal 
Reserve’s balance sheet, total reserve balanc es also increased in March.  Growth in 
both currency and total reserves contributed to rapid expansion of the monetary base 
last month.

ECONOMIC  OUTLOOK 
Information received since the March meet ing indicates that the labor market has 
continued to deteriorate sharply and that business fixed investment has retained 
considerable downward momentum.  None theless, equity prices have rebounded 
strongly since mid-March, consumer spending  appears to have leveled off, and some 
tentative signs of stabilization have been evident in the housing sector.  Looking 
ahead, the staff forecast is predicated on the assumption that the Federal Reserve will 
not implement any further liquidity or credit programs beyond those that have already been announced and that it will not furt her expand its large-scale asset purchase 
programs.  As in March, the staff also as sumes that the FOMC will hold the target 
federal funds rate within its current range through the end of the forecast period.  
Long-term Treasury yields edge higher ov er the period as the window over which 
expected future short-term rates are averaged moves forward and thus encompasses fewer years of near-zero funds rates, but they do so from a level about 15 basis points 
lower than in the previous forecast.  In vestment-grade corporate bond yields have 
moved down about 45 basis points since the March Greenbook and are projected to 
decline another 140 basis points over the forecast horizon as risk spreads narrow 
further from their current high readings.  Mortgage rates are anticipated to remain at 
about their current level—which is about 20 basis points lower than in March—over 
the medium term, reflecting the offsetting in fluences of a slight continued downward 
drift in their spread to Treasuries and the projected rise in Treasury yields.  Equity 
prices are projected to increase at an annual  rate of 15 percent from a level about 18 
percent higher than at the time of the previous forecast, as the equity risk premium 
moderates gradually.

and the March FOMC meeting.

to 3½ percent over the intermeeting period  and is assumed to edge lower over the 
balance of this year and fall by about 2 pe rcent in 2010.  Broadly consistent with 
futures quotes, oil prices move  up to $56 per barrel by the end of this year and to $63 
per barrel at the end of 2010, levels that are about $8 per barrel higher than at the 
time of the March Greenbook.   
Against this backdrop, real GDP is expected  to decline at an annual rate of 1½ 
percent in the second quarter, a bit more slow ly than in the previous forecast.  Output 
is projected to stabilize in the third quarter, and a moderate recovery is expected to 
get under way late this year.  Nevertheless, with GDP growing more slowly than 
potential output through the first quarter of next year, the unemployment rate is 
projected to increase to 9¼ percent in th e fourth quarter of this year and remain at 
that level, on average, in 2010.  Core PCE prices are expected to rise at a slightly 
higher rate than previously projected, reflecting higher energy prices and a stronger 
economic outlook; still, low levels of resour ce utilization, the lagged effects of large 
declines in the prices of oil and other commodities, and reductions in core import 
prices are expected to hold core PCE infl ation to 1.2 percent in 2009 and just 0.7 
percent in 2010.  Headline PCE prices are pr ojected to increase 0.7 percent in 2009 
and 1 percent next year.   
Looking further ahead, the staff forecast s real GDP to expand about 5 percent 
per year, on average, from 2011 to 2013, as monetary policy remains stimulative, 
financial turmoil subsides, and the recovery in residential construction gains 
momentum.  With actual output outpacin g its potential by a wide margin, the 
unemployment rate declines st eadily over this period, reaching 4¾ percent (the staff’s 
estimate of the NAIRU) by late 2013.  Unde r the assumption that long-run inflation 
expectations remain relatively well anchored, the gradual recovery in real activity 
allows core PCE inflation first to stabilize and then begin to move up slowly to

1.1 percent by 2013.  Beyond 2013, moneta ry policy fosters an extended period of 
modestly above-average resource utilization in order to bring inflation gradually back 
to the desired rate of 2 percent.  Once this  is achieved, the real economy settles into a 
balanced growth path with trend expans ion of about 2¾ percent per year, an 
unemployment rate of 4¾ percent, and a nominal federal funds rate of about 4¼ 
percent.

MONETARY  POLICY STRATEGIES 
As shown in Chart 7, all of the estimates of short-run r*—that is, the value of the 
real federal funds rate that would clos e the output gap within 12 quarters—have 
moved up since the March Bluebook.  The Greenbook-consistent measure of short-
run r* is currently about -3¼ percent.  This  estimate has risen about 2 percentage 
points since March, mainly as a result of the recent increase in equity prices and the 
depreciation of the dollar.  These factors have  also pushed up by a similar amount the 
FRB/US model estimate of short-run r* , which now stands at about -6¾ percent; this 
estimate does not incorporate the judgmental  estimates of fiscal stimulus or the 
effects of unconventional monetary po licy that are embedded in the Greenbook-
consistent measure.  (In the estimat ion of the FRB/US model’s short-run r*, all the 
exogenous variables are forecasted using simple rules that do not take account of the 
staff’s projection.)  Higher equity pr ices have also boosted the short-run r* estimate 
from the small structural model; it is now about -9 percent.9  Apart from the estimate 
produced by the single-equation model, all of the estimates are substantially below the 
actual real funds rate of -1¾ percent; the estimate from the single-equation model, 
which does not explicitly contro l for the effects of financial st ress or fiscal stimulus, is 
in line with the actual real rate. 
Chart 8 shows the result of optimal c ontrol simulations of the FRB/US model 
that were conducted using the long-run staf f forecast as a starting point; in these 
simulations, the federal funds rate is the in strument of monetary policy.  Policymakers 
                                           
9  In the estimation of the small structural mo del, the real bond yiel d is now based on the 
10-year BBB corporate rate, replacing the Moody’ s BAA corporate rate.  The Moody’s rate 
was less affected by the financial crisis than the rates facing most BBB issuers.  If the 
definition had been changed in March, the estimate of short-run r* from the small 
structural model would have been 1½ percent age points lower than the value shown in the 
March Bluebook.

are assumed to place equal weight on keeping core PCE inflation close to an inflation 
goal of 2 percent, on keep ing unemployment close to the NAIRU, and on avoiding 
changes in the funds rate.  As in recen t Bluebooks, monetary policy is severely 
constrained by the zero lower bound in these simulations, and the nominal funds rate 
remains close to zero through 2013 (black solid  lines).  As a result, the real funds rate 
hovers around -1 percent through the entire simulation period.  Chart 8 also displays counterfactual results that would be obtaine d if the zero bound did not constrain the 
nominal federal funds rate (blue dashed lines).  This counterfactual scenario can provide a useful benchmark for considering the stimulus that may be provided by 
unconventional monetary policy (see box “Policy Paths for Large-scale Asset Purchases”).  Under this unconstrained policy, the funds rate falls to -7½ percent late 
next year, rising back above zero in 2012.  The real funds rate decreases to about -8½ 
percent by the end of 2010.  Relative to th e constrained case, such a policy places the 
civilian unemployment rate on a distinctly lo wer path over the next few years and core 
PCE inflation on a higher path.
10  These paths for unemployment and inflation are 
essentially the same as those in March (red dotted lines).  The unconstrained 
prescription for the nominal funds rate in  the current Bluebook is above the March 
path, reflecting the somewhat stronger ou tlook for aggregate demand now seen by the 
staff.   
As depicted in Chart 9, the outcome-based policy rule prescribes a funds rate at its 
effective lower bound through the end of 2011.  (The midpoint of the Committee’s

Expectations in the FRB/US Model” by Da vid Reifschneider and John Roberts (April 20,

Policy Paths for Large‐scale Asset  Purchases  
In recent work, the staff has conducted optimal control 
simulations of the FRB/US model in which large-scale asset 
purchases (LSAPs) serve as the instrument of monetary policy while the federal funds rate is constrained by the zero lower bound.
1  This box presents an illustrative simulation of an 
optimal control LSAP policy and th en highlights some challenges 
and sources of uncertainty in specifying the appropriate magnitude and timing of asset purchases.
2 
In this simulation, LSAPs provide stimulus to the real 
economy by lowering longer-term yields; policymakers aim at 
keeping unemployment near the NAIRU and inflation near a 2 
percent objective, and they prefer  not to hold more of these 
assets on the Federal Reserve balance sheet than usual and not to make large adjustments in asset holdings.  The top panel on the right shows simulated paths of longer-term asset holdings acquired by the Federal Reserve through LSAPs, which would normally be zero.  Conditional on the staff’s economic outlook, the optimal control path of LSAP holdings (black solid line) peaks at almost $4 trillion by early 2011; in subsequent years this path gradually approaches the Greenbook baseline (green dotted line), which goes to zero after 2013. 
As shown in the lower panels, this more aggressive LSAP 
path fosters a somewhat faster pace of recovery than in the Greenbook baseline.  By the end of 2010, the unemployment rate is about ½ percentage point lower than the baseline while core inflation is somewhat above the staff projection.  These LSAP paths are between th e baseline outcome and the 
unconstrained optimal control simulation paths reproduced from Chart 8 (blue dashed line), in which the federal funds rate is allowed to fall below zero and the path of LSAPs is held at the Greenbook baseline. 
The scale of purchases in this optimal control simulation of 
LSAPs is about twice as large as simulations shown in a box in 
the March Bluebook,
3 while the outcomes for unemployment 
and inflation are broadly similar.  The main reason is a

  FOMC on April 20 2009, describes the simulation s and underlying assumptions in more detail. 
2 The LSAP simulation shown is the sa me as the “lower cost” path show n in the box “Large-Scale Asset  
  Purchases and the Economic Outlook”  in Part I of the Greenbook.   
3 The simulations in the March Bluebook were based on a given scale of LSAPs of up to $2 trillion without  
  concern for optimal control.

downward revision in the staff’s assessment of the likely effects of asset purchases on longer-
term yields.4  In the LSAP simulation shown here, an announcement of purchases over the next 
two quarters decreases yields by reducing the expe cted net supply of longer-term debt relative to 
the total stock of government debt.  In light of recent data on interest rate movements, the effect 
of purchasing a given share of the market for longer-term assets is now estimated to be 
somewhat lower than assumed in earlier staff work.  This estimate is subject to a wide margin of error and could change considerably as additional information is incorporated.  Furthermore, actual and projected levels of government de bt have surged since late 2008, reducing the 
expected responses of yields to asset purchases of a given dollar size. 
There is also considerable uncertainty concerni ng how yields are affected by purchases of 
different categories of assets.  In the simula tions reported in the March Bluebook, the staff 
assumed that purchases of MBS and agency debt have larger effects on their own yields than purchases of Treasury securities have on Treasury yields.  The data tend to confirm that recent 
purchases had indeed larger effects on MBS and agency yields, but since their spreads have declined, the staff assumes that the responses of such yields to any future LSAPs would be roughly similar to the effects on longer-term Treasury yields. 
Additional considerations add to uncertainty regarding the effect of LSAPs on the economy.  
One particularly uncertain factor is whether yi elds are affected primarily by the stock of 
purchased assets or by the flow of purchases.  Another source of uncertainty is the extent to which yields are affected by the announcement of future LSAPs as  opposed to their execution.  
These issues are hard to assess empirically given the very limited data available. 
Finally, LSA
Ps may raise some significant risks that are not incorporated in the staff model 
or sufficiently captured by assumptions about policymakers’ preferences for avoiding large 
holdings of longer-term securities  as well as rapid adjustments in such holdings.  For example, 
financial markets might be disrupted by outsized  LSAP purchases or by the heavy sales that 
might be required if the economy were to recove r more rapidly than anticipated.  The LSAP 
simulation shown here requires the Federal Reserve to buy almost half the stock of outstanding longer-term Treasury debt, agency de bt, and agency MBS.  At this scale, the scope of purchases 
would have to be extended to the secondary market and off-the run securities and would crowd investors out of the primary market, as net borrowing of the U.S. Treasury is projected to reach only $2.8 trillion over the next two years.  Moreover, purchases of the scale shown on the previous page would boost the reserves of depository institutions by up to $4 trillion, putting massive upward pressure on the size of their balance sheets—which currently total only about $15 trillion—at a time when many institutions are seen as having weak capital positions.  As a result, depository institutions could pull back from  lending even further, potentially offsetting at 
least a portion of the expansionary effect of the LSAP.  Finally, the very large purchases 
contemplated here expose the balance sheet of the Federal Reserve to considerable interest rate risk, pointing to the possibility of significant capital losses, in particular if large and rapid sales of 
securities proved necessary to regain control over the federal funds rate.

0 to 25 basis point target range is taken as the effective lower bound.)  Given the 
somewhat less sluggish outlook, the federal fu nds rate begins to increase a couple of 
quarters earlier than in the March Bluebook.11  Financial market participants appear to 
anticipate that the funds rate will rise  to 1½ percent by the end of 2010 and 
subsequently reach a plateau at just under 3 percent.  Compared with those shown in 
the March Bluebook, the confidence interval s around these forecasts, derived from 
market prices of interest-rate caps, are tighter through 2013.12   
The lower panel of Chart 9 provides ne ar-term prescriptions of simple policy 
rules.  As shown in the left hand columns, these funds rate prescriptions are generally 
constrained by the zero lower bound.  The right hand columns show the prescriptions 
implied by these rules if the zero lower boun d is not imposed.  In this case, the Taylor 
(1993) rule prescribes a funds rate of a bout ¼ percent this quarter and -½ percent 
next quarter.  The Taylor (1999) rule prescribes a funds rate close to -3 percent this 
quarter and -3¾ percent next quarter, reflecting the rule’s higher sensitivity to the output gap.  The estimated outcome-based and forecast-based rules also prescribe 
negative nominal federal funds rates for the next two quarters. 
                                           
11 The procedures used to gene rate confidence intervals with the FRB/US model have been 
substantially modified since the last Blue book, and are now based on a longer and more 
volatile sample period.  By itself, this change  generates appreciably wider intervals for 
forecasts of the federal funds rate.  However, this  effect is offset for near-term interest rate 
forecasts by another methodological change to the way the zero lower bound is imposed 
on the outcome-based policy rule.  For further details, see the memo to the FOMC, 
“Changes in Macroeconomic Uncertainty” by Robert Tetlow and Peter Tulip (April 20, 2009).  
12 Given the uncertainty about the economic  and financial outlook, reading policy 
expectations from federal funds futures and opt ions is not straightforward; in particular, 
the term premium may be larger than usual.  The most recent dealer survey shows that no respondent expects an increase in the target ra te before the first quarter of 2010 and that 
half of respondents anticipate the first rate incr ease to occur during or after the first quarter 
of 2011.

POLICY ALTERNATIVES  
This Bluebook presents two policy alternat ives and a variation on the language of 
one of the alternatives for the Committee ’s consideration, summarized by the draft 
statements on the following pages.  Un der Alternative A, the Committee would 
expand its purchases of longer-term Treasury securities to as much as $750 billion and 
would lengthen the time period over which these purchases would take place to the 
end of the year.  Under Alternative B,  the Committee would instead maintain the 
course of policy announced in March an d not make any changes to the planned 
purchases of long-term assets.  Under Alternative B ´, the Committee would also stay 
the course, but in the Committee’s statement the purchases would be translated into 
both an approximate dollar amount per month and an average monthly percentage 
growth rate of the System’s holdings of thes e assets through the end of the year.  All 
three alternatives introduce language stat ing explicitly that the Committee’s future 
decisions as to the timing and overall amoun ts of purchases of long-term assets will 
depend on the evolution of the economic  outlook and on changes in financial 
conditions.  Under all alternatives, the Co mmittee would seek to maintain the federal 
funds rate within the current range of 0 to ¼ percent and would again communicate 
its expectation that the federal funds rate is likely to remain at exceptionally low levels for an extended period.

March  FOMC  Statement  
Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in January indicates 
that the economy continues to contract.  Job lo sses, declining equity and housing wealth, and 
tight credit conditions have weighed on consumer sentiment and spending.  Weaker sales 
prospects and difficulties in obt aining credit have led busine sses to cut back on inventories 
and fixed investment.  U.S. ex ports have slumped as a number of major trading partners 
have also fallen into recession.  Although  the near-term economic outlook is weak, the 
Committee anticipates that policy actions to st abilize financial markets and institutions, 
together with fiscal and monetary stimulus, will contribute to a gradual resumption of 
sustainable economic growth. 
In light of increasing economic slack here an d abroad, the Committee ex pects that inflation 
will remain subdued.  Moreove r, the Committee sees some risk  that inflation could persist 
for a time below rates that best foster econom ic growth and price stability in the longer 
term. 
In these circumstances, the Federal Reserve wi ll employ all available tools to promote 
economic recovery and to preserve price stabili ty.  The Committee will maintain the target 
range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 pe rcent and anticipates that economic conditions 
are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period.  
To provide greater support to mortgage le nding and housing markets, the Committee 
decided today to increase the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet further by 
purchasing up to an additiona l $750 billion of agency mortgage-backed securities, bringing 
its total purchases of these securities to up to  $1.25 trillion this year, and to increase its 
purchases of agency debt this year by up to $1 00 billion to a total of up to $200 billion.  
Moreover, to help improve conditions in priv ate credit markets, the Committee decided to 
purchase up to $300 billion of longer-term Trea sury securities over the next six months.  
The Federal Reserve has launched the Term As set-Backed Securities Loan Facility to 
facilitate the extension of credit to households and small businesses and anticipates that the 
range of eligible collateral for this facility is likely to be expanded to include other financial 
assets.  The Committee will continue to carefu lly monitor the size and composition of the 
Federal Reserve's balance sheet in light of evolving financial and economic developments.

THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE  B   
If policymakers believe that the Committee has already put in train a substantial 
amount of monetary stimulus and think that the Federal Reserve’s policies, coupled 
with the effects of the fiscal stimulus approved by the Congress and the 
implementation of the financial stability plan, will likely suffice to return the economy 
reasonably promptly to a path of sustainabl e growth, they could decide to reaffirm the 
course of policy announced in March, as in Alternative B .  Mortgage rates have 
declined substantially since the Committee fi rst announced its intention of purchasing 
large quantities of agency debt and mortgage -backed securities.  Similarly, long-term 
private yields have declined somewhat, on net, since the March announcement that the Committee would increase its purchases of agency securities and would begin 
purchasing Treasury securities.  The Commi ttee may be of the view that these lower 
rates are providing stimulus to the economy that is likely to increase in coming 
months as households and businesses respond with a lag to the lower rates.  Indeed, 
the data received over the intermeeting period suggested some stabilization in 
consumer spending and housing activity, and the staff has revised up its outlook for 
growth during the remainder of this year and next year.  Against this backdrop, the Committee may see no compelling reason to further expand the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet and may prefer instead to observe how the economic situation 
unfolds before considering an additional expansion of the planned accumulation of 
longer-term assets.  The option of waiting be fore deciding to acquire even more of 
those assets may be especially attractive if the Committee is concerned that holdings 
of long-term assets could prove difficult or costly to unwind when that becomes 
necessary.   
Some of the credit and liquidity facilities  that the Federal Reserve put in place to 
facilitate the extension of credit to businesses and households have seen diminished

usage of late.  Even though some of the decline in usage may be attributable to 
government-imposed conditions that are viewed as onerous by borrowers, members 
may judge that the decline has been larg ely a reflection of the improvement in 
financial conditions observed over the inte rmeeting period.  If so, the Committee may 
see no need to compensate for that reduct ion with an increase in asset purchases, 
particularly given that the Federal Rese rve balance sheet has expanded since the 
March meeting.  In addition, incoming da ta have pointed to somewhat higher-than-
expected inflation.  Members might interp ret the latter development as tentative 
evidence that the downside risk to price st ability has diminished slightly amid higher 
energy prices and less bleak prospects for economic activity, reinforcing the judgment 
that there is no need for immediate furt her expansion of asset purchases.    
The statement suggested for Alternative B begins by noting that recent 
information indicates that the economy has c ontinued to contract and that, although 
the outlook has improved modestly, economic activity is likely to remain weak for a 
time.  Nonetheless, the statement points out that the policy actions taken recently, 
together with fiscal and monetary stimulus, will contribute to a gradual resumption of 
sustainable growth.  The paragraph characteri zing the outlook for in flation is identical 
to that in March.  In the third paragraph, the statement reiterates that the Committee will use all available tools to promote economi c recovery and preserve price stability.  
It also repeats the Committee’s expectation that  the federal funds target rate is likely 
to remain at very low levels for an extend ed period, and it reminds the markets and 
the public that the FOMC has already decide d to purchase large quantities of Treasury 
and agency securities over the course of th e year.  The draft statement introduces new 
language to emphasize that the Committee stands ready to adjust the timing and 
overall amounts of these purchases as appropriate; this new sentence aims to 
communicate to the public that monetary policy will be a function of the evolving economic outlook and conditions in financia l markets.  The statement then mentions 
April 23, 2009
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)
Page 40 of 64
that the Federal Reserve is employing a ra nge of other programs to facilitate the 
extension of credit to households and bu sinesses and to support the functioning of 
financial markets.  As in March, the statement concludes by noting that the 
Committee will monitor the size and composition of the Federal Reserve’s balance 
sheet in light of economic and financial developments. 
The Committee may prefer a description of  its large-scale asset purchases that 
characterizes the path of those purchases in addition to their overall amount.  
Members might believe, for example, that em phasizing the path of purchases would 
better communicate the sense that policymakers have a forward-looking plan for the conduct of policy.  If so, Committee members may want to adopt a slightly different 
statement, such as the one suggested under Alternative B´ .  This statement is 
identical to the one for Altern ative B, except that it adds two sentences in the middle 
of the third paragraph to specify that  the Committee expects that the Federal 
Reserve’s holdings of Treasury and agency s ecurities will increase at an average pace 
of about $160 billion per month over the reminder of 2009, which would be equivalent to an average monthly growth ra te of around 20 percent from the end of 
March through the end of the year.
13  This sentence adds information about the 
Committee's expectation for the growth of th e securities portfolio over time to a 
statement that maintains the basic structur e of those previously released by the 
Committee. 
                                           
13 As of the end of March, there were $ 782.5 billion of Treasu ries, agency debt, and 
mortgage-backed securities on the Federal Rese rve’s balance sheet.  Of those, $307.2 
billion were securities acquired recently under the announced purchase programs.  
Subtracting that amount from the announced $1 .75 trillion of total pl anned purchases gives 
$1.443 trillion of those securities that still have  to be acquired by year-end.  Dividing that 
amount by nine months (April to December) resu lts in a constant monthly purchase rate of 
$160.3 billion, or 20.5 pe rcent of the $782.5 billion of initial holdings.

Judging from the Desk’s survey of primar y dealers, very few market participants 
appear to expect an expansion in long-ter m asset purchases or other significant policy 
actions at this meeting.  Accordingly, the market reaction to the release of a statement 
such as that suggested for Alternatives B or B ´ should be muted.  Short- and long-
term yields, stock prices, and the foreign exchange value of the dollar all should 
change little.   
THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE  A 
If the Committee is concerned that the near-term outlook for economic activity 
might be worse than that presented in the staff forecast and that the subsequent 
recovery might be unduly sluggish, it may prefer to apply additional monetary 
stimulus by expanding its purchases of long-t erm assets at this m eeting, along the lines 
of Alternative A .  The Committee may judge that th e signs of economic and financial 
stabilization that were seen over the intermeeting period were quite tentative and that significant uncertainties remain as to the ti ming and extent of the economic recovery, 
perhaps along the lines of the “False Dawn”  alternative scenario in the Greenbook.  
Alternatively, the Committee might think that the economic outlook presented by the 
staff is quite plausible but unacceptably we ak.  While members may be satisfied that 
the purchases of agency debt and mortgage -backed securities already in train are 
having a significant beneficial effect on mortgage rates, they may also view the 
amount of Treasury purchases announced in March as insufficient to have a substantial effect on private yields, especial ly in light of the relatively modest net 
decline in those yields since the March meet ing.  Indeed, the relatively small decline 
may have induced members to revise down th eir estimates of the elasticity of private 
yields to those purchases and to increase  their views of the volume of purchases 
necessary to produce a given amount of monetary stimulus.  In addition, the 
Committee may be concerned that the effects on interest rates of the purchases of 
April 23, 2009
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)
Page 42 of 64
Treasury securities already planned may be largely offset by the effects of greater 
issuance of such securities to fund a larg e projected budget deficit.  And members 
may take comfort from the thought that th e potential cost of expanding the balance 
sheet through additional acquisitions of Tr easury securities may not be high since 
holdings of those securities may  be relatively easy to unwi nd when appropriate, albeit 
perhaps at a capital loss.  
In view of the shallow trajectory of th e Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan 
Facility (TALF) to date and the contraction in some other liquidity facilities, some 
members might see the need to take additional action at this meeting to maintain a 
brisk expansion of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet.  Members may believe that the recent decline in the usage of some Federal Reserve facilities might not be solely the result of improved financial conditions but rather to a significant degree is a 
byproduct of increased stigma associated with those programs that reflects the recent conditions imposed on participants in cer tain government programs.  Similarly, 
members may feel that fears of govern ment actions may undermine the TALF.  
Members may thus view an increase in th e purchases of Treasury securities as 
appropriate to offset, at least in part, the reduced policy stimulus generated by existing 
credit facilities.  If members are concerned that the economy will continue to contract 
in the near term and that the recovery will be sluggish, they might also judge that the risks that inflation will persist below rates consistent with price stability remain largely 
intact even though recent data have pointed to somewhat higher inflation than had 
been anticipated. 
The first paragraph of the statement that accompanies Alternative A is similar to 
the one for Alternative B, but its descri ption of the economic outlook is more 
downbeat.  It says explicitly that the Co mmittee expects that economic activity will 
continue to contract in the near term and that the subsequent recovery could be 
April 23, 2009
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)
Page 43 of 64
sluggish.  Also, it does not refer to the anti cipated beneficial effects of previous policy 
actions and monetary and fiscal stimulus.  The paragraph on inflation is virtually 
identical to the one in the March statement.  In the third paragraph, the statement 
announces that the Committee has decided to  provide additional monetary stimulus 
by stepping up its purchases of Treasury s ecurities to as much as $750 billion by year 
end—an increase of $450 billion relative to the March decision and an extension of 
the time period over which these purchases wi ll take place.  The rest of the statement 
is identical to that for Alternative B,  including language to communicate the 
possibility of future adjustments to the ti ming and overall amounts of purchases of 
long-term assets in light of the evolvi ng economic outlook and financial market 
conditions, the maintenance of the current ra nge for the federal funds target rate, the 
expectation that short-term rates will remain exceptionally low for an extended 
period, and the references to other liquidi ty programs and the Committee’s intention 
to monitor the Federal Reserve’ s balance sheet carefully.  
Since market participants reportedly see only small odds that the Committee will 
announce a further expansion of its securities pu rchases at this meeting, it is likely that 
asset prices would move substantially follow ing the release of a statement like that 
accompanying Alternative A.  Treasury and private yields dropped significantly on 
March 18 after the announcement that th e Federal Reserve would purchase $300 
billion of Treasury securities and an additional $850 billion in agency debt and 
mortgage-backed securities.  Still, the resp onse of yields to an announcement of 
additional Treasury purchases might be sm aller than previously thought (see box 
entitled “Policy Paths for Large Scale Asset Purchases”).  Even though Alternative A 
more than doubles the quantity of Treasu ry purchases announced in March, the 
immediate response of Treasury and corpor ate yields may be substantially smaller 
than the one observed after the release of the March statement because that statement 
also announced large increases in the purcha ses of agency securities.  Keeping in mind 
April 23, 2009
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)
Page 44 of 64
that the uncertainty surrounding any judg ments regarding the effects of increased 
securities purchases on asset prices is very large, the staff estimates that the 
announcement that the Federal Reserve will pu rchase an additional $450 billion worth 
of Treasury securities will push down long -term yields between 20 and 45 basis points 
immediately after the announcement.  Equi ty prices would likely climb, and the 
foreign exchange value of th e dollar would decrease.

LONG‐RUN PROJECTIONS  OF THE BALANCE  SHEET  AND MONETARY  BASE 
Under the Federal Reserve’s current policy approach, the size of the Federal 
Reserve’s balance sheet over the next severa l years will be driven by the evolution of 
its assets, specifically, the scale of asse t purchases and demand for Federal Reserve 
liquidity programs and credit facilities.  The total amount of liabilities will be 
determined by the total quantity of assets, and their composition will be determined 
by the evolution of currency demand and other factors on the liability side with 
reserve balances determined largely as a residual. Two balance-sheet scenarios are 
presented here; they differ in their assu mptions regarding asset purchases.  The baseline  
scenario includes only asse t purchases that have already been announced by the 
FOMC: the Desk purchases a total of $300 b illion of Treasury securities, $200 billion 
of agency securities, and $1,250 billion of  agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) 
this year.  The baseline scenario corre sponds to Alternative B in the Policy 
Alternatives section.  In the expanded purchases  scenario, which corresponds to 
Alternative A in the Policy Alternatives section, purchases of U.S. Treasuries are 
increased by $450 billion to $750 billion by the end of the year.  
To construct the projections, we had to make assumptions about all 
components of the balance sheet other than reserve balances, which are the residual 
item.  The foreign central bank liquidity swap lines and the Term Auction Facility 
(TAF) are assumed to wind down by year-end 2010 and year-end 2011, respectively, 
as financial markets continue to improve.  The Section 13(3) facilities are assumed to be extended beyond October 30, 2009, but they are assumed to run off by the end of 
2010 in a fashion similar to the swaps.  The assets held by Maiden Lane, Maiden Lane 
II, and Maiden Lane III are assumed to be sold over time; they reach zero by 2015.  
In light of the slow initial uptake of the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility 
(TALF), the facility is assumed to peak at $500 billion—half of the announced 
April 23, 2009
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)
Page 46 of 64
$1 trillion limit—at the end of 2010:  The first phase of TALF makes $100 billion of 
3-year loans by the end of 2009; later pha ses are assumed to make $400 billion of 
3-year loans by the end of 2010.  For large- scale asset purchases, the baseline path of 
purchases matches the assumed path in  the Greenbook whereas the expanded 
purchases scenario boosts Treasury purchases; both scenarios assume that the assets 
purchased are held to maturity.  We a ssume a slower-than-average path for the 
prepayment of MBS that implies that appr oximately half of the MBS purchases are 
still on the balance sheet in 2016.  On th e liability side of the Federal Reserve’s 
balance sheet, both scenarios assume that currency (Federal Reserve notes) grows at the same rate as the staff forecast for money stock currency through 2010 and thereafter expands at the rate of nomin al GDP growth in the extended Greenbook 
forecast.  The Treasury’s Supplementary Fi nancing Account is projected to wind 
down by the end of 2009, and the U.S. Treasury’s general account returns to its historical target level of $5  billion over the same period.  All other liabilities except 
reserve balances are assumed to be constant.
14  These projections for liabilities, 
combined with the assumed path for assets, imply a path for reserve balances under each scenario.  In both scenarios, the imp lied level of reserve balances rises rapidly 
until late in 2009, then declines until 2015,  at which point we assume that the Desk 
begins conducting open market operations to maintain a level of $25 billion of reserve 
balances for the rest of the projection period. 
Under both scenarios, the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet expands rapidly over 
the course of 2009.  For th e baseline scenario, the size of the balance sheet reaches 
$3.4 trillion at the end of 2009 and then dec lines to a level just below $1.4 trillion in 
2015 before beginning to expand again.  The composition of assets differs notably 
from historical patterns.  U.S. Treasury secu rities account for less than one-quarter of 
                                           
14 More details on the assumptions are provided in Appendix C.  
April 23, 2009
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)
Page 47 of 64
 total assets at the end of 2009, and less th an half at the end of the projection period, 
whereas prior to August 2007, Treasuries accounted for about 90 percent of assets.  
By the end of the projection period, the alternative path yields the same composition and size of the balance sheet as the baseline scenario.  
Projections for the monetary base are derived from these balance-sheet 
projections as the sum of currency in circ ulation and reserve balances.  Under both 
scenarios, the monetary base expands rapidl y in 2009 and into 2010.  In the second 
quarter of 2010, however, as the liquidity  facilities are winding down and asset 
purchases have ceased, the monetary base be gins to contract; the base continues to 
decline until mid-2016, at which point the st abilized level of reserve balances and the 
continued growth of currency lead to resumed growth in the base.  
The extended Greenbook projection shows the target federal funds rate rising 
from the current 0 to ¼ percent range to 2 percent over the course of 2013.  Under 
the operating procedures employed befo re the financial crisis, the projected 
end-of-year level of approximately $426 bi llion of reserve balances would not have 
been consistent with a federal funds rate sign ificantly above zero.  If the interest rate 
paid on excess reserve balances becomes an effective floor on the federal funds rate, a 
higher target rate could be achieved even with quite elevated reserve balances.  The 
experience last autumn, however, suggests that the Desk would likely need to drain 
reserves through open market operations to  get the funds rate significantly above 
zero.  This projection for the balance sh eet implicitly assumes that alternative 
operating procedures can be put in place to achieve the path for the federal funds rate assumed in the Greenbook projection.  If no such operating proced ures are available, 
the baseline projection of the balance shee t includes over $600 billion in Treasury 
securities that in principle could be sold  by the end of 2013.  In practice, some 
combination of tools, including reverse repu rchase agreements, outright sales of

securities, or other strategies, would need  to be balanced against potential costs, 
including possible capital losses experienced by the Federal Reserve or disruption to 
markets.  These projections do not assume th e statutory authority to issue Fed bills or 
a renewal of the Supplementary Financing Program.

BANK CREDIT , DEBT, AND MONEY FORECASTS 
Bank credit is forecast to decline at  about a ¼ percent pace in 2009, largely 
reflecting weakness in core lo ans so far this year, and to expand at a 4½ percent rate 
in 2010 as economic activity is anticipated to pick up.  C&I loans are projected to 
grow only modestly over the remainder of this year and in 2010, reflecting a 
significant contraction in business fixed in vestment and weak inventory investment.  
Real estate loans are likely to run off slight ly in 2009 but to grow about 3 percent in 
2010 amid a resumption of growth in reside ntial investment.  Consumer loans are 
expected to be about flat in 2009 and to ex pand at about a 2¼ percent rate in 2010, as 
growth of personal consumption expend itures and nominal GDP picks up.  
Domestic nonfinancial sector debt is ex pected to expand 4¼ percent in the 
current quarter, about the same pace as in th e first quarter.  The level of private-sector 
debt is forecast to decrease in the sec ond quarter as households pay down debt (on 
net) and as borrowing by nonfinancial busine sses remains soft.  Amid weak household 
spending, falling home prices, and tight terms and standards for bank loans, 
borrowing by households is expected to  remain extremely light through 2010.  
Similarly, borrowing by nonfinancial busi nesses is projected to remain sluggish 
throughout the forecast period, reflecting weak investment spending, borrowing costs 
that remain relatively high, an d tight terms and standards for bank loans.  Federal debt 
will likely continue to expand at a rapid pace through the end of 2010.   
M2 is forecast to expand at an annual ra te of 3½ percent in 2009, well above the 
growth rate of nominal GDP, boosted by the lagged effects of dec lines in opportunity 
cost and ongoing financial market volatility.  In 2010, M2 is expected to decelerate to 
a 2½ percent annual rate, below nominal GD P growth, as some of the unusually rapid

DIRECTIVE 
Draft language for the dir ective is provided below. 
ALTERNATIVE  A 
The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that 
will foster price stability and promote sust ainable growth in output.  To further its 
long-run objectives, the Committee seeks c onditions in reserve markets consistent 
with federal funds trading in a range from  0 to 1/4 percent.  The Committee directs 
the Desk to purchase agency debt, agency MBS, and longer-term Treasury securities 
during the intermeeting period with the ai m of providing support to private credit 
markets and economic activity.  The timi ng and pace of these purchases should 
depend on conditions in the markets for su ch securities and on a broader assessment 
of private credit market conditions.  The Committee anticipates that the combination 
of outright purchases and various liquidity facilities outstanding will cause the size of 
the Federal Reserve's balance sheet to expand significantly in coming months.  The 
Desk is expected to purchase up to $200 billion in housing-related agency debt by the 
end of this year.  The Desk is expected to purchase at least $500 billion in agency 
MBS by the end of the second quarter of this year and is expected to purchase up to $1.25 trillion of these securities by the en d of this year.  The Committee also directs 
the Desk to expand the System’s purchases of  longer-term Treasury securities to up to 
$750 billion of longer-term Treasury secu rities.  The System Open Market Account 
Manager and the Secretary will keep the Committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the System's balance sheet that could affect the attainment 
over time of the Committee's objectives of  maximum employment and price stability.

Appendix  A:  Measures  of the Equilibrium  Real  Rate 
 
The equilibrium real rate is the real federal funds ra
te that, if maintained, would be projected to return 
output to its potential level over time.  The short-run equilibrium rate is defined as the rate that would close 
the output gap in twelve quarters given the co rresponding model’s projection of the economy.   
The medium-run concept is the value of the real federal funds rate projected to keep output at potential in 
seven years, under the assumption that monetary policy acts  to bring actual and potential output into line in 
the short run and then keeps them equal thereafter.  The TIPS-based factor model measure provides an 
estimate of market expectations for the real federal funds rate seven years ahead.  
The actual real federal funds rate is constructed as the difference between the nominal rate and realized 
inflation, where the nominal rate is measured as the qua rterly average of the observed federal funds rate, and 
realized inflation is given by the log difference bet ween the core PCE price index and its lagged value four 
quarters earlier.  For the current quarter, the nominal ra te is specified as the target federal funds rate on the 
Bluebook publication date.  For the current quarter and the previous quarter, the inflation rate is computed 
using the staff’s estimate of the core PCE price index.  If the upcoming FOMC meeting falls early in the 
quarter, the lagged inflation measure ends in the last quarter.   
Confidence intervals reflect uncertainties about model speci fication, coefficients, and the level of potential 
output.  The final column of the table indicates  the values published in the previous Bluebook.  
 
   
 
Measure Description 
Single-equation 
Model  The measure of the equilibrium real rate in the single-equation model is based on an 
estimated aggregate-demand relationship between the current value of the output gap and its 
lagged values as well as the lagged values of the real federal funds rate. 
Small Structural 
Model  The small-scale model of the economy consists of equations for six variables: the output gap, the equity premium, the federal budget surplus, the trend growth rate of output, the real bond 
yield, and the real federal funds rate. 
Large Model 
(FRB/US)  Estimates of the equilibrium real rate us ing FRB/US—the staff’s large-scale econometric 
model of the U.S. economy—depend on a very broad array of economic factors, some of 
which take the form of projected values of the model’s exogenous variables. 
Greenbook-
consistent  The FRB/US model is used in conjunction wi th an extended version of the Greenbook 
forecast to derive a Greenbook-c onsistent measure.  FRB/US is first add-factored so that its 
simulation matches the extended Greenbook foreca st, and then a second simulation is run off 
this baseline to determine the value of the real federal funds rate that closes the output gap. 
TIPS-based 
Factor Model Yields on TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securi ties) reflect investors’ expectations of the 
future path of real interest rates, but also include term and liquidity premiums.  The TIPS-
based measure of the equilibrium real rate is constructed using the seven-year-ahead 
instantaneous real forward rate derived from TIPS yields as of the Bluebook publication date.  This forward rate is adjusted to remove esti mates of the term and liquidity premiums based 
on a three-factor arbitrage-free term-structure model applied to TIPS yields, nominal yields, 
and inflation.  Because TIPS indexation is based on the total CPI, this measure is also 
adjusted for the medium-term difference—pro jected at 40 basis points—between total CPI 
inflation and core PCE inflation.

Estimates of
 the real federal funds rate depend on the proxies for expected inflation used.  The table below 
shows estimated real federal funds rates based on lagged core PCE inflation, the definition used in the 
Equilibrium Real Federal Funds Rate chart; lagged four -quarter headline PCE inflation; and projected four-
quarter headline PCE inflation beginning with the next quarter.  For each estimate of the real rate, the table also provides the Greenbook-consistent measure of the short-run equilibrium real rate and the average actual real federal funds rate over the next twelve quarters.

Rule Specifications:  For the following rules, it denotes the federal funds rate for quarter t, while  
the explanatory variables include the staff’s projec tion of trailing four-quarter core PCE inflation (πt), 
inflation two and three quarters ahead ( πt+2|t and πt+3|t), the output gap in the current period and one quarter 
ahead (*
ttyy−  and *
1| 1|tt ttyy++− ), and the three-quarter-ahead foreca st of annual average GDP growth 
relative to potential (44*
3| 3| tt ttyy++Δ− Δ ), and *π denotes an assumed value of policymakers’ long-run 
inflation objective.  The outcome-based and forecast-based rules were estimated using real-time data over 
the sample 1988:1-2006:4; each specification was chosen  using the Bayesian information criterion. Each rule 
incorporates a 75 basis point shift in the intercept, specified as a sequence of 25 basis point increments 
during the first three quarters of 1998.  The first two simple rules were proposed by Taylor (1993, 1999).  
The prescriptions of the first-difference ru le do not depend on assumptions regarding r* or the level of the 
output gap; see Orphanides (2003). 
 
Outcome-based rule it =  1.20i t-1–0.39i t-2+0.19[1.17  + 1.73 πt  + 3.66(*

ttyy− ) 
First-difference rule it = i t-1 + 0.5(πt+3|t –*π) + 0.5(44*
3| 3| tt ttyy+ + Δ− Δ ) 
 
FRB/US Model Simulations:  Prescriptions from the two empiri cal rules are computed using dynamic 
simulations of the FRB/US model, implemented as t hough the rule were followed starting at this FOMC 
meeting.  The dotted line labeled “Previous Bluebook” is based on the current specification of the policy 
rule, applied to the previous Greenbook projection.  Confidence intervals are based on stochastic simulations of the FRB/US model with shocks draw n from the estimated residuals over 1969-2008.  
Information from Financial Markets :  The expected funds rate path is based on forward rate agreements, 
and the confidence intervals for this path are constructed using prices of interest rate caps. 
Near-Term Prescriptions of  Simple Policy Rules:  These prescriptions are calculated using Greenbook 
projections for inflation and the output gap. Because th e first-difference rule involves the lagged funds rate, 
the value labeled “Previous Bluebook” for the current quarter is computed using the actual value  
of the lagged funds rate, and the one-quarter-ahead prescr iptions are based on this rule’s prescription for the 
current quarter.

Appendix  C:  Long‐ run Projections  of the Balance Sheet and  Monetary  Base  
This appendix presents in more detail the assumpt ions underlying the long-run projections of the 
Federal Reserve’s balance sheet and the monetary base shown in the section entitled “Long-run 
Projections of the Balance Sheet and Monetary Base.” 
General assumptions 
The projections are constructed at a monthly frequency from May 2009 to December 2016.  The 
few balance sheet items that are not discussed below are assumed to be constant over the projection 
period at the level reported in the April 16, 2009  Federal Reserve H.4.1 statistical release. The 
projections for all major assets and liabilities are su mmarized in the charts and table that follow the 
bullet points. 
Assets 
Liquidity and Credit Facilities 
• Primary credit remains unchanged over the rest of 2009 and then falls to $1 billion by the 
end of 2011 and remains at that level thereafter. 
• Term Auction Facility (TAF) credit is assumed to decline with improved market functioning 
and is zero at the end of 2011. 
• Foreign central bank liquidity swaps decline with improved market functioning and are zero at the end of 2010. 
• Section 13(3) facilities, except for the Term A sset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF), 
are assumed to be extended beyond October 30, 2009.  Credit extended through these 
facilities declines with improved market functioning and is zero at the end of 2010. 
• The TALF, based partly on its slow  initial uptake, is assumed to peak at $500 billion, half of 
the $1 trillion limit.  For purposes of these pr ojections, TALF is assumed to consist of two 
components:  TALF 1.0 and TALF 2.0/3.0.  TALF 1.0 issues loans wi th 3-year maturity and 
reaches $100 billion by the end of 2009.  These loans then all mature and the quantity outstanding reaches zero by the end of 2012 .  TALF 2.0/3.0 has loans with 3-year maturity 
and reaches $400 billion by the end of 2010.  These loans then all mature and the quantity 
outstanding reaches zero by the end of 2013. 
Asset Purchases 
• In the baseline scenario, only asset purcha ses that have already been announced are 
incorporated.  The Desk purchases a total of  $300 billion of Treasury debt (by September 
2009), $200 billion of agency debt, and $1,2 50 billion of agency MBS ($500 billion by mid-
year).  The maturity distribution of the Tr easury purchases is based on FRBNY Markets 
Group internal forecasts. The maturities of most purchases are between two and ten years, 
with the average being approximately five years.  No sales are assumed but maturing securities are redeemed and are not replaced.  As a result, total holdings of Treasury debt 
decline as issues mature.  No assumption is  made about the maturation of securities

previously held in the SOMA portfolio; in other words, they are assumed to be reinvested as 
they mature.  Most of the agency debt being purchased by the Desk is short-term, so 
holdings of these securities are assumed to mature through time.  For MBS, the rate of 
prepayment is based on rough estimates from the Desk.  The historically low coupon on these securities implies a relatively slow prep ayment rate.  As a result, at the end of 2016, 
$600 billion of the $1.25 trillion purc hased remains on the balance sheet. 
•  In the alternative scenario, purchases of U.S. Treasuries are increased by $450 billion to $750 billion by the end of the year.  No other changes to the assumptions are made and securities mature at the same rate as in the baseline scenario. 
• At the end of the projection period, the expansion of currency combined with a runoff of other assets necessitates the resumption of standard open market purchases to maintain 
reserve balances at a level of $25 billion.  It  is assumed that the Desk purchases Treasury 
securities over time to satisfy this need. 
Liabilities 
• Currency (Federal Reserve notes in circulation) grows in line with the staff forecast for money stock currency through the end of 2010.  From 2010 to the end of the projection period, currency grows at the rate of nominal GDP as implied by the extended Greenbook 
forecast. 
• The U.S. Treasury’s general account returns to it s historical target level of $5 billion by the 
end of 2009.  This account remains constant  at that level over the forecast period. 
• The Treasury’s Supplementary Financing Account is projected to wind down to zero by the end of 2009, and remain at zero for th e remainder of the forecast period.  
• Reverse repurchase agreements are expected to decrease to $40 billion by the end of 2010 as 
foreign official and international accoun ts move to other investments.   
• For most of the projection period, reserve balanc es of depository institutions are assumed to 
be determined by the evolution of the assets an d other liabilities of the Federal Reserve.  As 
the asset side of the balance sheet contracts, so do reserve balances.  When the implied level of reserve balances reaches $25 billion, the Desk is assumed to conduct open market 
operations to offset the growth of currency to  maintain a constant $25 billion dollar level.
