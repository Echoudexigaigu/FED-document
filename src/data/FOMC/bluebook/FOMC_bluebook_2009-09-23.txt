 CLASS I FOMC  - RESTRICTED CONTROLLED (FR)
MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES  
PREPARED FOR THE FEDERAL OPEN MARKET COMMITTEE  
BY THE STAFF OF THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM  SEPTEMBER 17, 2009 
 
 RECENT DEVELOPMENTS  
SUMMARY 
Financial market conditions continue d to become more supportive of 
economic activity over the intermeeting period.  Despite economic data that 
appeared to be about in line with expect ations, Treasury yields declined over 
the period as statements by policy makers were seen as consistent with a flatter 
path for interest rates and term prem iums apparently fell.  Risk spreads 
narrowed a bit further, and equity prices  rose, on net, over the period.  On 
balance, conditions in short-term fu nding markets showed some additional 
signs of improvement, and borrowing from  Federal Reserve facilities declined 
further over the intermeeting period.  In  contrast, bank credit remained very 
weak, with the runoff particularly not able for business loans.  Moreover, 
spreads on commercial and industrial loan rates increased further to a very high 
level.   
Financial market conditions abroad al so improved over the intermeeting 
period.  Equity prices increased in most advanced foreign economies and emerging markets, although they decrease d in Japan and China.  With several 
foreign central banks underscoring thei r commitments to keep interest rates 
low for an extended period, yields on so vereign debt generally fell.  The dollar 
depreciated against most major currencies. 
MONETARY  POLICY  EXPECTATIONS  AND TREASURY  YIELDS 
The Committee’s statement following  the August FOMC meeting was 
broadly in line with market expectat ions, and subsequent price action was 
muted, with both nominal and real Trea sury yields edging down.  Market

1 The effective federal funds rate averaged 0.15 percent over the intermeeting period.  
Trading volumes were roughly constant throughout the period, and the intraday 
standard deviation av eraged 4 basis points.  Market participants speculated recently 
that the impending decline in the Treasury’s supplementary financing account and the resulting increase in reserve balances  may put some downward pressure on the 
effective federal funds rate.  participants reportedly took particular note of the reiteration of the “extended 
period” language, of the indication that “economic activity is  leveling out,” and 
of the decision to gradually slow the pace of Treasury securities purchases.  
Investors also noted the continued discussion of reserve management tools 
that could be employed in the context of a withdrawal of policy accommodation.  The release of the mi nutes on September 2 also generated 
little market reaction, although mention of the Committee’s discussion about 
the possible tapering of agency debt and mortgage-backed securities (MBS) 
purchases garnered attention, as di d comments indicating that the economy 
would likely recover only slowly in the second half of the year.
 1 
Futures quotes combined with the staff’s standard assumptions about term 
premiums imply that policy expectations  for the second half of 2010 and for 
2011 shifted down about 30 to 55 basi s points over the intermeeting period 
(Chart 1).  Futures rates now suggest th at investors do not expect the first 
increase in the federal funds target rate until the second quart er of 2010, slightly 
later than at the time of the last FO MC meeting and closer to expectations 
obtained from survey data.  Indeed, the Desk’s September dealer survey results indicated that all but 3 of the 17 respondents  expect the first target rate increase 
to occur during or after the third qua rter of 2010.  This prediction was 
essentially unchanged from the August su rvey; the lack of change – along with 
a decline in policy uncertainty measured from implied volatility from options

 on interest rate futures – suggests that at  least part of the decline in the policy 
path owed to lower term premiums, which are not captured in staff models. 
Nominal Treasury yields declined, on net, across the curve over the 
intermeeting period.  Against the back drop of weak economic activity and a 
benign outlook for inflation, investors may have simply concluded that a lower 
path of interest rates would be more consistent with the likely pace of 
economic recovery.  As with shorter-te rm rates, however, some of the decline 
in longer-term yields may have re flected lower term premiums.   
Yields on five-year Treasury inflati on-protected securities fell more than 
their nominal counterparts, leaving five -year inflation compensation 20 basis 
points higher, while five-year inflation compensation five years ahead declined 
by roughly 35 basis points.  The reduction in forward inflation compensation unwound some of the run-up in this measure over the preceding intermeeting 
period.  Staff models indicate that r ecent fluctuations in this measure mainly 
reflect changes in liquidity and inflation risk premiums rather than changes in 
inflation expectations.  Readings on l ong-term inflation expectations from 
surveys were about flat over the period. 
Auctions of $254 billion in Treasury  coupon securities across the term 
structure were conducted during the inte rmeeting period.  Most auctions were 
well received, with stop-out rates close to or lower than when-issued rates just 
prior to the auctions and bid-cover ratios near or above average.  Indirect bidding participation continued to be  strong, led by demand from foreign 
accounts and investment funds.

2 On September 9, the FDIC issued a notice of proposed rulemaking presenting an 
option for extending the Debt Guarantee Program (DGP), a component of the 
Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program.  Under the option, the DGP would expire as indicated in the current regulation; how ever, the FDIC would establish a limited 
six-month emergency guarantee facility under which the FDIC would guarantee 
senior unsecured debt issued on or before  April 30, 2010.  Market participants 
reportedly noted that use of the emergency guarantee facility would likely be very limited as the high participation cost an d stringent application requirements would 
attach significant stigma to its use.
 
 CAPITAL MARKETS 
Broad equity indexes rose about 6 to 10  percent, on net (Chart 2).  Implied 
volatility as measured by the VIX ended th e period a bit lower.  The equity risk 
premium – measured by the staff’s estimat e of the expected real equity return 
over the next ten years relative to the real ten-year Treasury yield – edged down 
over the period, but remains elevated. 
Developments regarding banks were mi xed over the period.  While equity 
prices for large banks rose 10 percent,  stock prices for regional and smaller 
banks were about unchanged.  Market pa rticipants reportedly continue to be 
concerned about smaller institutions’ ex posure to the commercial real estate 
sector.  In addition, 21 depository institutions failed over the intermeeting 
period, likely contributing further to the reduction in investor confidence in 
smaller banks.  Meanwhile, CDS spreads for banks were about unchanged on balance over the period.  Despite the fa ct that spreads on nonguaranteed senior 
unsecured debt increased somewhat ov er the period, issuance continued in 
August at roughly the rate posted in July.  While none of the debt issued in 
August carried an FDIC guarantee, so far in September, one firm, Citigroup, 
has issued $5 billion in FDIC-guaranteed debt.

 In the broader corporate bond market, risk spreads edged down further 
over the period.  While indexes of in vestment-grade corporate CDS spreads 
ended the period little changed on balance, those of speculative-grade CDS 
spreads narrowed appreciably.  Munici pal bond yields declined, on net, 
resulting in very little change in the ratio of municipal bond yields to those on 
comparable-maturity Treasury securities.   
The new-issue market for commercial mortgage-backed securities remained 
closed as conditions in the commercial real estate sector continued to be quite 
weak.  Commercial property prices fell furt her in the second quarter, reaching a 
level about one-third below their peak in 2007.  Delinquencies on commercial 
mortgages held by banks continued to rise in the second quarter, and the 
delinquency rate on securitized comme rcial mortgages remained near its 
historical high in July.  Commercial real  estate sales ticked up in August but 
remained well below historical no rms.  Indexes of CDS spreads on AAA 
tranches of commercial mortgages we re little changed on net, over the 
intermeeting period. 
Interest rates on 30-year conforming  fixed-rate residential mortgages 
retraced a portion of the increase record ed in the late spring and ended the 
intermeeting period at about 5 percent, down roughly 20 basis points over the intermeeting period.  Yields on agency MB S also trended down in line with the 
yields on Treasury securities.  Reflecting the lower interest rates on mortgages 
early this spring, issuance of MBS by the housing-related GSEs remained very 
strong in July.   
In the consumer sector, spreads on AAA-rated consumer-loan asset-backed 
securities (ABS) have now retraced almo st entirely the run-up seen over the

 past year.  Delinquencies on consumer  loans remained elevated, and charge-
offs on such loans at commercial banks in creased further in the second quarter.  
Gross issuance of consumer-loan ABS pr oceeded at a pace well above that 
recorded earlier in the year, and issuance (at least in some sectors) appeared to 
be somewhat less reliant on Term Asse t-Backed Securities Loan Facility 
(TALF) financing.  Despite the improv ed conditions in ABS markets, overall 
consumer credit registered a noteworthy decline in July, contracting at a 10½ 
percent annual rate, after falling at  a 6½ pace in the second quarter. 
MARKET FUNCTIONING  
Functioning and liquidity improved mo destly or held steady in most 
financial markets over the intermeeting period.  Spreads between Libor and overnight index swaps (OIS) at the three- and six-month maturities narrowed 
somewhat further; however, tierin g in the interbank market reportedly 
remained substantial (Chart 3).  Bid-aske d spreads and haircuts for most types 
of repurchase agreements were little changed, and no bids were submitted at 
either of the Term Securities Lending Facility auctions during the period.  
Spreads on A2/P2-rated commercial paper and AA-rated asset-backed 
commercial paper fluctuated near the bottom of the ranges established since the beginning of the crisis.  Average fitting  errors in staff yield curve models for 
nominal Treasury issues were little ch anged, but those for TIPS securities 
declined further.  Trading volume for Tr easury securities was little changed, but 
remained relatively low.   
Some improvements in functioning and liquidity were also evident in the 
corporate bond market.  The median estimated bid-asked spreads for both speculative- and investment-grade bonds ed ged lower, and the average range of 
CDS dealer contributions narrowed a bit further.  However, the basis between

 the CDX investment-grade index of CDS spreads and investment-grade 
corporate bond spreads – a rough gauge of  possible arbitrage opportunities in 
corporate debt markets – was little changed at a level that remains somewhat high by historical standards.   
Total Federal Reserve assets incr eased about $135 billion over the 
intermeeting period as increased holdings of securities outpaced declines in 
credit supplied through liquidity and credit facilities.  (See box entitled “Balance Sheet Developments during the Intermeeting Period.)  Reflecting further 
improvements in market conditions, th e Federal Reserve announced that the 
amount offered at the September Term Auction Facility (TAF) auctions would 
be reduced another $25 billion to $75 bill ion.  For the two auctions that took 
place over the intermeeting period, proposit ions continued to fall short of the 
amounts offered, and the auctions stopped out at their minimum bid rates.  The TALF was the only facility to regist er an increase over the period.  The 
$6.5 billion in loans issued under th e September 3 TALF operation supported 
roughly $16.8 billion in ABS issuance; th is ratio is the lowest ratio of TALF 
support to issuance to date.  The low rati o partly reflects the narrowing of ABS 
spreads.  In addition, a large proportion of  the deals were backed by prime auto 
loans, which have tended to re ly less on TALF financing. 
BANK CREDIT , DEBT, AND  MONEY 
Total assets at commercial banks decr eased at an average annual rate of 
almost 12 percent in July and August, as  declines in bank credit more than 
offset a significant increase in cash assets that owed to higher levels of reserves.  
Indeed, bank credit continued to contract  rapidly in August, declining at nearly 
an 11 percent annual rate.  As in July , all major loan components decreased.  
Commercial and industrial (C&I) loans dropped at a 28 percent annual pace

Balance Sheet Developments  during the Intermeeting  Period 
Since the August FOMC meeting, the Fe deral Reserve’s total assets edged up 
to about $2.1 trillion.1  As a result of ongoing asset purchases, securities held 
outright increased by $191 bi llion, which more than offset the $60 billion decline in 
lending through liquidity and credit facilities.   
The Open Market Desk purchased $34 bil lion in Treasury securities, $15 billion 
in agency debt securities, and $142 billion in agency mortgage-backed securities 
(MBS) during the intermeeting period.2,3  In contrast, most of the System’s other 
liquidity and credit programs contracted fu rther, reportedly due to improvements in 
global bank funding markets and market participants’ desire to reduce their reliance 
on government sponsored programs for fundin g.  Term auction credit declined $38 
billion, foreign central bank liquidity swap s declined $14 billion, and primary credit 
declined $5 billion.  Lending under the Primary Dealer Credit Facility remained at 
zero, and securities lent through the Te rm Securities Lending Facility (TSLF)—
which do not affect on-balance-sheet assets because the Federal Reserve retains 
ownership of the securities lent—fell to zero. 
Use of facilities supporting money fund s and the commercial paper market also 
declined as
 a result of improvements in market conditions.  Credit extended by the 
Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF) decreased $15 billion.  Loans made 
under the Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity 
Facility (AMLF) fell by $35 million to $79 million.  Te rm Asset-Backed Securities 
Loan Facility (TALF) loans increased $1 4 billion over the intermeeting period.  
Roughly $7 billion of this increase repr esents loans extended under the TALF 
operation conducted on August 6, 2009 and settled on August 13, 2009.  The two 
TALF operations conducted during the interm eeting period were also of relatively 
modest size.  The first loan subscription, totaling $2.1 billion, funded legacy commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS).  The second loan subscription, 
totaling $6.5 billion, financed issuance of asset-backed securities collateralized by 
auto, credit card, student, small business, and mortgage-servicing-advance loans.   
                                                             
1 These data are through September 16, 2009. 
2 The figures for securities holdings reflect only trades  that have settled.  Over the intermeeting period, the 
Open Market Desk committed to purc hase, but has not settled, an additional $113 billion of MBS, on net. 
3 On August 17, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York  announced that it reduced the number of external 
investment managers for the agency mortgage-backed securities purchase program from four to two; one 
investment manager provides trade execution and the othe r provides analysis.  The first settlement with one 
external investment manager went smoothly.  On September 1, the Open Market Desk began to accept on-
the-run agency debt securities for purchase in order to mitigate market dislocations and promote overall 
market functioning.

On the liability side of the Federal Rese rve’s balance sheet, the U.S. Treasury’s 
general account decreased $30 billion.  The Treasury’s supplementary financing 
account remained unchanged at $200 bil lion, but the Treasury announced its 
intention to reduce supplementary financing balances over the next several weeks to preserve flexibility in conducting de bt-management policy as outstanding debt 
approaches the federal debt ceiling.  Rese rve balances of depository institutions 
increased $101 billion over the intermeeting period.

 (Chart 4).  Market commentary suggests bank loan demand remained weak in 
part because proceeds from a portion of high-yield bond issu ance were used to 
repay leveraged loans.  In addition, a ccording to the results of the Survey of 
Terms of Business Lending conducted in August, the weighted-average spread 
of C&I loan rates over comparable-mat urity market rates increased further.  
However, the average spread on loans to  the subset of lower-risk borrowers 
edged down.  The contraction in commercial real estate lending intensified last 
month, with large decreases posted by both large and small domestic banks.  
Some large banks reported substantial orig inations of residential mortgages, but 
that development was more than offset by increased sales of such loans to the 
GSEs, resulting in a 15 percent annu alized decrease in on-balance-sheet 
holdings in August.  Home equity and consumer loans also continued to fall.  Consistent with the recent runoff in total assets, banks shed managed liabilities 
again in August. 
Debt of the private domestic nonfinancial sector is estimated to have run 
off at an annual rate of 1¾ percent in the second quarter, as the levels of both 
household and nonfinancial business debt  fell.  Household mortgage debt 
declined at an annual rate of about 1½ percent in the second quarter while 
nonmortgage consumer credit shrank at an annual rate of 6½ percent.  On net, 
nonfinancial debt financing likely stepped down again in August, as sizable 
issuance of nonfinancial bonds was more th an offset by the decrease in C&I 
lending.  Net issuance of commercial pape r was about flat as firms apparently 
continued to substitute toward longer -term financing.  Federal government 
debt growth remained elevated, while state and local government borrowing 
picked up with the improved conditi ons in the municipal bond market.

 Overall, domestic nonfinancial sector de bt is estimated to have increased at 
an annual rate of 4¾ percent in the second quarter, up from 4 percent in the 
first quarter.  In the third quarter, dome stic nonfinancial debt is projected to 
expand at annual rate of 4 percent, with household and nonfinancial business 
debt contracting further and govern ment borrowing remaining rapid. 
The contraction in M2 steepened in August.  (See box “Why Is Money 
Growth So Weak?”)  The expansion in liquid deposits slowed further, and runoffs in small time deposits an d retail money market mutual funds 
accelerated, likely in part a result of investors’ increased appetite for riskier 
assets as the economy shows signs of r ecovery.  Currency expanded in recent 
months at much slower rates than in the fourth quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009.  Staff estimates sugge st this deceleration caused by a 
moderation in foreign demand for U.S. banknotes coupled with solid domestic demand.  The monetary base increased at about a 9 percent annual rate on balance over July and August as Fede ral Reserve asset purchases more than 
offset declining usage of most Federal Re serve liquidity and cr edit facilities.   
FOREIGN DEVELOPMENTS  
The trade-weighted index of the exchange value of the dollar against the 
major foreign currencies has declined 2½  percent since August 10.  Most of 
this depreciation occurred recently and may be attributable in part to investors’ 
reduced perceptions of risk.  In contrast, the exchange value of the dollar against the currencies of our other important trading partners has increased 
slightly over the period, as the dollar has appreciated 2½ percent against the 
Mexican peso.  This appreciation came after the Bank of Mexico signaled that it 
would scale back its foreign exchange intervention.

Why Is Money Growth So Weak?  
M2 grew at a tepid pace in the second quarter of this year and contracted 
appreciably over July and August. Steep declines in small time deposits and retail 
money market mutual funds (MMMFs) acco unted for the contraction; liquid 
deposits and currency, while still growing moderately, also decelerated from their 
earlier pace.  As shown in the figure, th is recent behavior follows robust money 
growth late last year and early in 2009 (th e solid line).  In general, the recent 
weakness (and prior strength) of M2 growth cannot be explained by a model based 
on the historical relationships of M2 wi th nominal income and opportunity costs 
(model predictions portrayed by the dashed  line).  Instead, two factors appear to 
account for the recent low growth.  First, declining bank credit and revised rules 
regarding deposit insurance premiums have likely led banks to bid less aggressively for deposits than they had in the past.
1  Second, with financial markets healing, the 
appetite for risk among investors eviden tly recovering, and returns on M2 assets 
quite low, households are apparently real locating their weal th away from the 
relative safety and liquidity of M2 assets.    
 
                                                             
1 As of the second quarter of 2009, the FDIC began including brokered deposits in excess of 10 percent of an 
institution’s domestic deposits in  the metrics used to price an institution’s depo sit insurance.

2 Funds swept from noninterest-bearing transaction accoun ts to noninterest-bearing savings accounts are also 
covered by the TLGP.                                                            As shown in Table 1, the expansion in  liquid deposits, the largest component 
of M2, picked up late last year amid th e turmoil in financial markets.  Growth 
remained robust through the second quarter of 2009 as the FDIC’s Temporary 
Liquidity Guarantee Program (TLGP), wh ich provides unlimited insurance on non-
interest-bearing transaction accounts at participating banks, likely made such deposits especially attractive to depositors during the crisis.
2  Small time deposits 
also surged in late 2008, as some deposit ory institutions bid aggressively for these 
funds amid strained conditions in wholesale funding markets.  Later, as conditions 
in funding markets began to improve, and as banks began to shrink their balance 
sheets, rates offered on these deposits fe ll and small time deposits began to 
contract.  Similarly, as MMMF rates hovered  near zero, balances at such funds ran 
off sharply.  Thus, the shift away from M2 assets is likely being boosted by the 
exceptionally low rates paid on M2 deposits.  Notably, the outflows from M2 have 
coincided with robust flows into long-ter m mutual funds, especially bond funds.   
The recent decline in M2 deposits is consistent with commercial banks’ 
reduced funding needs.  Loans on banks’ book s have contracted steeply this year in 
response to weak loan demand and tight lending standards and terms, and banks’ 
securities holdings have expanded only mo destly.  As a result, banks have pared

their managed liabilities considerably over the course of the year, and M2 deposits 
at banks have edged back, on average, since mid-year.

   Headline stock indexes in Europe increased about 9 percent, which market 
participants partly attributed to upbeat economic data releases, but the Japanese 
stock market was down about 3 percent.  CDS spreads on emerging market 
sovereign debt declined moderately, and equity prices in most major emerging 
market economies rose.  One exception is China’s A-shares, which declined 
about 6 percent.  Part of this decline was associated with media reports that 
authorities were taking actions to moderate  the pace of loan growth in China.   
Despite the release of upbeat economic indicators, expected policy rates 
over the next two years and sovereign yiel ds declined in most major industrial 
economies (Chart 5).  Market participants attributed part of these movements to major central banks emphasizing their commitments to keeping interest rates 
low.  The European Central Bank left  its main policy rate unchanged at 1 
percent, as expected, but surprised marke ts by announcing that it will offer 
banks twelve-month funds at only 1 pe rcent at its upcoming long-term 
refinancing operation.  The Bank of England (BoE) released its quarterly Inflation Report, which market participan ts interpreted as more pessimistic 
than had been expected on the outlook for recovery.  In connection with the release, Governor King expressed concer n that the remuneration of all reserves 
at Bank Rate, introduced along with it s quantitative easing program in March, 
created a disincentive for banks to turn those reserves into other assets.  Some 
market participants expect the BoE to re vert to a framework in which reserves 
exceeding a particular level are remunerated at a penalty.

3 The current Greenbook includes projecti ons for 2011 in the medium-term outlook 
and 2014 in the long-term outlook for the first time. 
4 Purchases of $300 billion in Treasury secu rities are assumed to be completed by the 
end of October; $150 billio n in agency debt and $1.25 trillion in agency MBS are 
projected to be finished by the en d of the first quarter of 2010.   ECONOMIC  OUTLOOK 
Information received since the August meeting provides further evidence 
that economic activity has begun to r ecover from its severe downturn.  The 
staff has revised up its forecast based on the accumulation of better-than-
expected data on economic activity.  Wi th the sharp decline in residential 
investment apparently over and business  spending on equipment and software 
likely to recover sooner than previously anticipated, the staff now anticipates that real GDP growth will increasingly exceed the growth of potential output 
over the second half of this year and through 2011.
3  As a consequence, the 
unemployment rate is projected to decl ine steadily in 2010 and 2011, although 
it remains nearly 8 percent at the end of  the forecast period.  Core and headline 
PCE inflation are projected to slow , reaching 1 percent in 2011.   
As in August, the staff outlook assume s that the federal funds rate will 
remain at its current level through 2011.  The staff has made no change in its 
assumptions about the sizes of the Federal Reserve’s large-scale asset purchase 
(LSAP) programs.  However, agency debt and agency MBS purchases are 
assumed to be completed a quarter later than in the August Greenbook.4  The 
staff continues to anticipate that fiscal policy will contribute about 1 percentage 
point, on average, to real GDP growth in 2009 and 2010, but will be roughly 
neutral in 2011.  In respons e to favorable news on the housing market in recent 
months, the staff now projects markedly less house price depreciation through 
next year than in the August Greenbook, and a slight appreciation in 2011.  
September 17, 2009
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)

 The staff projects longer-term Treasury yields and 30-year fixed mortgage rates 
to edge up through 2011, with little chan ge in the spread between the two rates.  
In contrast, yields on investment-grade corporate bonds are projected to 
decline substantially, as improvements in financial markets and the economic 
outlook lead to a ¾ percentage point narrowing in risk spreads by the end of 2011.  Similarly, the equity risk premium is  expected to continue to decline over 
coming quarters and stock prices are projec ted to rise at a brisk annual rate of 
about 14 percent over the next two year s.  The availability of bank credit to 
firms and households is expected to increase over time but remain tight by historical standards.  The real foreign exchange value of the dollar is assumed 
to fall at a 2½ percent annual rate over 2010 and 2011.  Based on readings from 
futures markets, the staff expects oil pri ces to rise gradually  to about $77 per 
barrel for West Texas Intermediate by th e end of 2011; this path is about $5 
per barrel lower than in the August Greenbook. 
Against this backdrop, the staff now expects real GDP to grow at an 
annual rate of about 2¾ percent during the second half of 2009, compared with 1¼ percent in the August Greenbook , and to expand about 3½ percent in 
2010 and about 4½ percent in 2011.  The unemployment rate is projected to 
peak at nearly 10 percent late this year and then to decline to about 9¼ percent 
by the end of 2010, which is about ½ percentage point lower than in the 
August Greenbook.  Unemployment is pr ojected to decline further over 2011 
to slightly under 8 percent—still well above the staff’s estimate of the NAIRU, 
which has been revised up to 5¼ percent over the forecast horizon.  In light of 
the current and prospective level of eco nomic slack, as well as inflation 
expectations that are expected to remain reasonably well anchored, the staff projects core PCE inflation to slow to 1¼  percent in the second half of this 
year and to about 1 percent in 2010 and 20 11.  With energy prices rising at a 
September 17, 2009
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)
Page 23 of 73
 
  diminishing rate, total PCE inflation is projected to be about 2 percent in the 
second half of 2009, 1¼ percent in 2010, and 1 percent in 2011. 
Looking further ahead, the staff assu mes that the funds rate will rise 
steadily starting in early 2012, climbing to about 2½ percent by the end of that 
year and to 3¾ percent in 2013, before leveling out at 4 percent in 2014.  The 
staff forecasts that real GDP will grow  nearly 5 percent in 2012 but then 
decelerate to about 2¾ percent by 2014.   With GDP growth outpacing growth 
in potential output, which is forecast to  average about 2¾ percent per year over 
this period, the unemployment rate is proj ected to fall rapidly for a time before 
stabilizing at about 4¾ percent, close to the staff’s estimate of the NAIRU in 
2014.  Inflation expectations remain well anchored and as growth returns to 
trend, total PCE inflation slowly rises to  about 1¾ percent by 2014, still below 
the inflation objectives implicit in th e majority of policymakers’ longer-run 
projections.

5 If the previous version of the FRB/US  model is used, the Greenbook-consistent r* 
measure for the current Bluebook is -2.2 percent.  This means that 50 basis points 
of the rise in r* are due to the improved outlook  and 30 basis points are due to 
changes in the in the FRB/US model.  The Greenbook-consistent r* measure using 
the prior vintage of the EDO model is -3.3 percent, implying that 170 basis points 
of the rise in the EDO-based r* come from the better ou tlook and 20 basis points 
from changes in the EDO model. MONETARY  POLICY STRATEGIES 
As shown in Chart 6, estimates of r*—the value of the real federal funds 
rate that would close the output gap within twelve quarters—have risen 
substantially since the August Bluebook.  Though all the estimates of short-run 
r* remain negative, they are no longer un iformly well below the actual real 
federal funds rate.  The different r* estimates  have increased for various 
reasons, but all were substantially boos ted by the effects of stronger-than-
expected incoming economic data on the staff assessment of the current level of aggregate demand, and its implicati ons for future slack in the various 
models.  The Greenbook-consistent measures of short-run r* from the 
FRB/US and EDO models stand at -1.9 and -3.1 percent, respectively, while the FRB/US and EDO model-based estimates of short-run r* are -2.4 and -0.3 
percent, respectively.  The ch anges in the FRB/US and EDO r* estimates 
largely reflect the improved economic ou tlook implied by incoming data but 
they also have been affected by the respecification and reestimation of the models that followed the comprehensive NIPA revision in July.
5  The estimate 
of short-run r* produced by the single-equation model  is now -1.3 percent, 
about 100 basis points hi gher than in the Augu st Bluebook, while the r*

6 The single-equation and small structural models have not changed since the August 
Bluebook.  
7 In the current projection, the staff estima te of the NAIRU is 5¼ percent, a 25 basis 
point increase over the previous Greenbook estimate.  estimate based on the small structural model is -1.1 percent, about 200 basis 
points higher than in the previous Bluebook.6  
Chart 7 shows the results of optimal control simulations of the FRB/US 
model.  These simulations use the extended  staff forecast as a starting point.  
Policymakers are assumed to place equal weight on keeping core PCE inflation 
close to a 2 percent inflation goal, on keeping unemployment close to the 
NAIRU, and on minimizing changes in th e federal funds rate.  As in recent 
Bluebooks, optimal monetary policy under these simulations is constrained by 
the zero lower bound, with the nominal  funds rate remaining at the lower 
bound until early 2012 (black solid line s).  The unemployment rate at the end 
of 2011 is well above the NAIRU, and core PCE inflation is appreciably below 
the 2 percent goal.7 
Chart 7 also displays the optimal control results that would be obtained if 
the nominal funds rate were not constr ained by the zero bound (blue dashed 
lines).  Under this unconstrained poli cy, the funds rate falls to about -4¾ 
percent by late next year and does not turn positive until 2012.  The 
unconstrained funds rate in 2010 and 20 11, although negative, is consistently 
more than 100 basis points above th at shown in the August Bluebook, 
reflecting the staff’s stronger forecast  of aggregate demand.  The improved 
economic outlook and the reestimation of the FRB/US model imply an 
appreciably faster decline in the unem ployment rate than in the previous

8 Real economic activity is considerably more  sensitive to interest rate movements in 
the reestimated version of FRB/US model th an in the previous version.  The model 
revision thus contributes to a faster declin e in the unemployment rate in the optimal 
control simulations. Bluebook, while the unconstrained optimal  path for core PCE inflation in 2010 
and 2011 is broadly similar to that shown in the previous Bluebook.8   
Also consistent with the improved outlook, the outcome-based policy rule 
prescribes a higher path for the federal funds rate than in the August Bluebook, 
as shown in Chart 8, with the rate star ting to move above the effective lower 
bound in 2011Q4, one quarter earlier than in August.  In contrast, based on the 
staff’s standard assumption about term premiums, market participants’ expectations regarding the path of the federal funds rate over the next few 
years appear to have shifted down by about 50 basis points.  However, as noted earlier, at least part of the apparent decline in investors’ expectations may 
reflect a decline in term premiums.  
The lower panel of Chart 8 provides near-term prescriptions from simple 
policy rules.  For the constrained rules, the current prescriptions are uniformly 
at the effective lower bound, except for the prescription from the first-
difference rule.  The first-difference rule pr escribes that the funds rate be raised 
when there is an increase in expected output growth.  The rule therefore calls 
for an increase in the funds rate as the recovery gains streng th.  The right-hand 
columns show the prescriptions that wo uld be implied by these rules if the 
lower bound was not imposed.  While th e first-difference rule prescribes a 
positive interest rate, the remaining rules’ unconstrained prescriptions are for negative policy rates.  In every case, how ever, these prescribed values are less 
negative than in the previous Bluebook, consistent with the staff’s improved 
assessment of the outlook.

 POLICY ALTERNATIVES  
This Bluebook presents three policy al ternatives—labeled A, B, and C—for 
the Committee’s consideration.  Table 1 gi ves an overview of key elements of 
these alternatives; draft statements are provided on the subsequent pages. 
Each of the three alternatives maintain s the 0 to ¼ percent target range for 
the federal funds rate and the previously announced plan to purchase $300 
billion of Treasury securities by the end of October, but the alternatives differ 
with respect to the size and timing of the Federal Reserve’s purchases of agency MBS and agency debt.  Under Alternative A, the Committee would increase its purchases of agency MBS to “a total of $1.5 trillion” (from the previous “up to 
$1.25 trillion”) and would extend the time over which purchases would be 
completed through the second quarter of 2010.  The increase would provide additional macroeconomic stimulus, while the extension would permit the pace 
of transactions to be tapered until completion to promote a smooth transition in markets (although this tapering is not  explicitly noted in the statement).  
Language about the amounts and timing of agency debt purchases (up to $200 billion by the end of the year) would be as  in the August statement.  Alternative 
B would essentially maintain the current stance of monetary policy but specify a 
tapering strategy for the purchases of agency MBS and agency debt: The pace 
would gradually slow, with purchases comp leted either by the end of the first 
quarter of 2010 or, in a variant of this alternative, by sometime in the second 
quarter of 2010.  In recognition of the pending completion of Treasury security 
purchases and the gradual scaling down  of the Federal Reserve’s liquidity 
programs, Alternative B notes that the Federal Reserve will use “a range of 
tools” rather than “all available tools” to promote economic recovery and preserve price stability.  Under Alternative C, the size of agency MBS purchases 
September 17, 2009
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)
Page 31 of 73
 
 would be reduced to “about $1 trillion” and that of agency debt to “about $150 
billion,” from their previously announced maximums, and the pace of 
purchases would be gradually reduced until their completion by year-end.  
Alternative C also makes more explicit the conditionality of the funds rate 
target on the evolution of the economic ou tlook by changing the language that 
characterizes the period over which the target range is likely to remain 
extraordinarily low.  
Each alternative provides a distinct characterization of the economic 
outlook.  Alternative A states that economic  activity “is leveling out” but notes 
that the economic recovery could be rela tively weak.  Alternatives B and C are 
progressively more optimistic, with Alte rnative B saying that economic activity 
has “picked up following its severe downturn” and Alternative C stating 
explicitly that the data suggest a “recove ry in economic activity has begun.”  All 
three alternatives acknowledge some further improvement in financial market 
conditions.  Alternatives B and C note increased activity in the housing sector.  As in the August statement, all thr ee alternatives reiterate the Committee’s 
expectation that inflation “will remain subd ued for some time.”  To explain this 
view, Alternatives A and B note that “substantial resource slack [is] likely to continue to dampen cost pressures,” while Alternatives B and C state that “inflation expectations [are] apparently well anchored.”  Alternative A also 
notes that “inflation has fallen c onsiderably over the past year.”

 August  FOMC  Statement  
Information received since the Federal Open  Market Committee met in June suggests 
that economic activity is leveling out.  C onditions in financial markets have improved 
further in recent weeks.  Household spen ding has continued to show signs of 
stabilizing but remains constrained by ongoing job losses, sluggish income growth, 
lower housing wealth, and tight credit.  Businesses are still cutting back on fixed 
investment and staffing but are making pr ogress in bringing inventory stocks into 
better alignment with sales.  Although economi c activity is likely to remain weak for a 
time, the Committee continues to anticipate that policy actions to stabilize financial 
markets and institutions, fiscal and mone tary stimulus, and market forces will 
contribute to a gradual resumption of sust ainable economic growth in a context of 
price stability. 
The prices of energy and other commodities have risen of late.  However, substantial 
resource slack is likely to dampen cost pressures, and the Committee expects that 
inflation will remain subdued for some time. 
In these circumstances, the Federal Reserve wi ll employ all available tools to promote 
economic recovery and to preserve price stability.  The Committee will maintain the 
target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and continues to anticipate 
that economic conditions are likely to warra nt exceptionally low levels of the federal 
funds rate for an extended period.  As previously announced, to provide support to 
mortgage lending and housing markets and to improve overall conditions in private 
credit markets, the Federal Reserve will pu rchase a total of up to $1.25 trillion of 
agency mortgage-backed securities and up to  $200 billion of agency debt by the end 
of the year.  In addition, the Federal Reserv e is in the process of buying $300 billion 
of Treasury securities.  To promote a smoot h transition in markets as these purchases 
of Treasury securities are completed, th e Committee has decided to gradually slow 
the pace of these transactions and anticipate s that the full amount  will be purchased 
by the end of October.  The Committee will continue to evaluate the timing and overall amounts of its purchases of securities in light of the evolving economic outlook and conditions in fi nancial markets.  The Federal Reserve is monitoring the 
size and composition of its balance sheet and will make adjustments to its credit and liquidity programs as warranted.

September  FOMC  Statement  – Alternative  A  
1. Information received since the Fede ral Open Market Committee met in 
August indicates  that economic activity is leveling out , and  conditions in 
financia
l markets have improved somewhat  further.  Businesses have made  
progress in bringing inventory stocks  into better alignment with sales. 
 
However, household spending is sluggish, job losses are ongoing, and 
credit remains tight.  Although the Committee continues to anticipate a 
resumption of economic growth  in a context of price stability, abs ent 
further policy action the economic re covery could be relatively weak, 
with slack in resource utiliz ation diminishing quite slowly . 
2. Inflatio
n has fallen considerably over the past year.  With  substantial 
resource sla
ck likely to continue  to dampen cost pressures, the Committee 
expects that inflation will re main subdued for some time. 
3. To promo
te a sustained economic recovery and higher resource 
utilization, the Committee has decided to provide additional monetary stimulus by increasing its purc hases of agency mortgage-backed 
securities to a total of $1.5 trillion, up from the previously announced amount of as much as $1.25 trilli on, and to extend these purchases 
through the second quarter of 20 10.  As previously announced,  the 
Federal Reserve is in the process of buyi ng $300 billion of Treasury securities 
by the end of October and up to $ 
200 bi llion of agency debt by the end of the 
year.  The Committee will maintain the ta rget range for the federal funds rate 
at 0 to ¼ percent and continues to anticipate that low levels of resource 
utilization and subdued inflation  are likely to warrant exceptionally low 
levels of the
 federal funds rate for an extended period .  The Committee will 
continue to evaluate the timing an d overall amounts of its purchases of 
securities, in light of the evolving economic outlook and conditions in financial markets.  The Federal Reserve is monitoring the size and 
composition of its balance sheet and will make adjustments to its credit and

 THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE  B 
If policymakers believe that the policy stimulus already in train is likely to foster 
the most satisfactory economic outcomes feasible given current economic 
circumstances, the Committee could reaffirm its forward guidance regarding the funds 
rate and continue implementing its previo usly announced large-scale asset purchases 
(LSAPs), while providing additional information regarding the winding-down process, 
as in Alternative B .  Maintaining the current stan ce of monetary policy might be 
appealing if the Committee shares the staff’s assessment that incoming economic and financial news is consistent with inflat ion remaining subdued and economic growth 
picking up to an acceptable pace in coming quarters as financial market conditions 
and the housing sector continue to improv e.  While the staff’s forecast has been 
revised up, projected employment growth re mains modest, with the level of private 
payroll employment at the end of 2011 still about 1 million below its pre-recession peak, suggesting that a very accommoda tive stance of monetary policy remains 
appropriate.  Although the improved outl ook has led to sizable increases in the 
Greenbook-consistent measures of short-run r* since August, these measures are still 
negative.  The anticipation that the federal fu nds rate is likely to remain exceptionally 
low “for an extended period” remains consis tent with the funds rate path implied by 
the estimated outcome-based rule, despite th e upward shift in this path since the 
August Bluebook (Chart 8).   
Even if some participants now fores ee a more rapid resumption of economic 
growth and a stronger recovery than in the Greenbook (similar to the Greenbook’s 
“V-Shaped Recovery” alternative scenario), they may prefer to wait for more definitive signs of this stronger recovery  before modifying their policy stance, given 
the uncertainties surrounding the economic  outlook and the approaching expiration 
of some government programs that have been supporting growth.  Even under the

9 See the September 16, 2009, Desk memorandum, “Tapering of Agency MBS and Agency 
Debt LSAPs.” more robust conditions of this scenario, the Taylor rule does not prescribe a policy 
tightening until early 2011. 
Alternatively, policymakers may view the prospective economic recovery with its 
protracted return to full employment as le ss than satisfactory, but they may believe 
that the potential benefits of providing fu rther monetary stimulus through expanded 
LSAPs are likely to be outweighed by th e potential costs.  These costs include 
potential losses on the Federal Reserve’s portfolio under scenarios involving a sharp 
increase in short-term interest rates over the next few years, the possibility that an 
expanded balance sheet could lead to higher inflation expectations, and the increased 
complications that a larger balance sheet  could entail for the Committee’s exit 
strategy. 
The Committee may find it desirable to slow the pace of its agency MBS and 
agency debt transactions so that these purc hases taper off instead of ending abruptly, 
thereby minimizing the risk of  financial market disruptions.9  This approach would be 
consistent with the gradual slowing of the pace of Treasury purchases announced in 
August and with market expectations that  the Federal Reserve will adopt a similar 
strategy for the agency debt and agency MBS programs (as indicated by responses to 
the Desk’s survey of primary dealers).  Im plementing the slowing without changing 
the total maximum amount to be purchased would necessitate extending the time 
over which the purchases would be complete d.  Alternative B suggests two possible 
end dates for the purchases:  the end of the first quarter or sometime in the second 
quarter of 2010. 
To the extent that the primary influence of the programs is through the 
cumulative effect that they generate on the publicly available stocks of securities 
September 17, 2009
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)
Page 39 of 73
 
 rather than through the pace of new purchases, the choice between these end dates 
would probably make little difference to the macroeconomic effect of the asset purchases.  But the desire to taper purchase s as they end is predicated on the belief 
that the pace of asset purchases affects asset prices to some degree, even if stock effects dominate.  Extending the timeframe would allow for a more gradual tapering, 
thereby helping to alleviate market participants’ concerns that there could be an abrupt price reaction upon the Fed’s exitin g the market.  The Committee might also 
consider the longer extension desirable because it would allow for more flexibility in the path of future purchases, so that the total amounts purchased could be better calibrated to changes in the economic outlook.  For example, the Committee might value the optionality in a strategy that init ially involved appreciably smaller weekly 
purchases than at present.  Such a strate gy would provide more opportunities for the 
Committee to evaluate, based on the evolut ion of the economic outlook, whether to 
end purchases before the maximum levels are reached or to raise the level of 
purchases.  However, the cost of greater optionality for the Committee is that it 
entails less certainty for market participants.  In addition, the longer extension means 
a reduced flow of purchases, given no change in the total amount purchased.  Policymakers who view the flow of purcha ses as having a significant macroeconomic 
impact may see the reduced flows entailed  in the longer extension as a cost.  
A statement such as that suggested for Alternative B would be close to market 
expectations and would likely have muted effects in financial markets.  The Desk’s 
survey of primary dealers indicates that th ey uniformly expect no change in the funds 
rate target or in the maximum sizes of th e LSAPs.  Nearly all the dealers said they 
expect the Federal Reserve to adopt a tape ring strategy for agency debt and agency 
MBS, with the median survey respondent anticipating completion by the end of the first quarter of 2010.  Accordingly, if the Committee chooses to extend its purchases through the first quarter of next year, ther e would likely be little immediate change in 
September 17, 2009
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)
Page 40 of 73
 
 short- and long-term yields, eq uity prices, or the foreign exchange value of the dollar.  
Extending purchases into the second qua rter of 2010 might put some upward 
pressure on long-term yields in the near term to the extent that flow effects are 
important and also to the extent that mar ket participants view the reduced pace of 
sales over a longer period as  signaling higher odds that the Committee will ultimately 
choose to purchase smaller quantities than curre ntly anticipated.  However, at least to 
some degree, extending purchases into th e second quarter would mean lower long-
term yields during that period than otherw ise.  Also, market participants may perceive 
the revision in language from the Federal Reserve’s using “all available tools” to “a 
range of tools” as indicating less chan ce of future increase s in the LSAPs, but 
currently, investors appear to be putti ng little weight on an expansion.  
THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE  C 
If policymakers view the incoming da ta as pointing to more underlying 
momentum in the nascent recovery than they previously anticipated and are at least as optimistic as the staff regarding the economi c outlook, they might choose to trim the 
size of the LSAPs and to adjust the langua ge regarding the anticipated period over 
which the funds rate is likely to remain extraordinarily low, as in Alternative C .  
Under this alternative, the Committee would announce lower amounts of planned 
purchases of agency MBS and agency debt  compared with the current maximum 
amounts and would revise the stated expect ation for a very low federal funds rate.  
Instead of “for an extended period,” the statement would say: “So long as inflation 
remains well contained, the Committee will maintain the target range for the federal 
funds rate at its exceptionally low level of 0 to ¼ percent until it has greater assurance 
that the economic recovery will be sustaine d.”  The revised language has the benefit 
of being more explicit that the stance of monetary policy will depend on the evolution 
of the economic outlook, which may prove us eful as a first step in preparing the 
public and the markets for an eventual increa se in the federal funds rate target.  The 
September 17, 2009
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)
Page 41 of 73
 
 change in language would likely be seen by market participants as pointing to an 
earlier end to the period of extraordinarily  low funds rates than is implied by the 
Committee’s recent statements.  
Participants might prefer Alternative C if they viewed the continued improvement 
in financial market conditions and the significant upward revision in the staff forecast 
as suggesting that less monetary policy su pport from the Federal Reserve is required 
and, given the improvement in the housing sector, that a reduction in the maximum 
amount of purchases of mortgage-related a ssets, in particular, could be appropriate. 
Participants might also prefer not to purchase the previously announced 
maximum amounts if they saw greater upside ri sks to inflation than  does the staff.  
(The “Early Liftoff” scenario in the Gr eenbook, which couples a strong rebound in 
growth with an increase in inflation exp ectations, illustrates the possible need to 
remove policy accommodation earlier than in the baseline.)  Participants might, for 
example, have some concern that if bankers’ attitudes toward lending were to shift 
rapidly with the improvement in the economic outlook, the large amount of reserves in the banking system could bring about a larger and more rapid expansion of bank 
credit, fueling even stronger aggregate demand growth, and potentially leading to 
significantly increased upward pressure on prices.  The recently announced reduction 
in the Treasury’s Supplementary Financing Program, which will increase the amount 
of reserves in the banking system and likely put some downward pressure on the funds rate, may also be a consideration.  The Committee may believe that such risks 
would be moderated by purchasing less than the previously announced maximum 
amounts, thereby lowering the accumulation of reserves in the banking system.   
Moreover, participants may perceive less  slack in the economy than in the staff 
forecast if they view the very large negati ve shock of the financial crisis and the

 more sharply over the forecast horizon than assumed by the staff.   A less optimistic 
outlook for aggregate supply, and the atte ndant consequences for inflation, might 
incline the Committee to scale back the LSAP s.  In addition, if policymakers put less 
weight on output gaps and more weight on  inflation expectations when forecasting 
inflation, they may prefer to slow the growth  of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet if 
they are concerned that its rapid expansion could fuel inflation expectations; for the 
same reason, they may also want to signal an  earlier increase in the federal funds rate 
target than suggested in the Comm ittee’s recent policy statements.   
The adoption of Alternative C would surp rise market participants.  As noted 
above, primary dealers expect LSAPs to re ach their previously announced maximums.  
Moreover, fewer than 20 percent of the deal ers indicated that they expect the federal 
funds rate to be raised above its effectiv e lower bound by next June; another half 
expect the initial rate increase to occur later next year, and the remainder expect 
tightening to begin in 2011 or later.  Inde ed, over the intermeeting period, the implied 
path of the federal funds rate based on futures quotes and the staff’s standard assumptions about term premiums has shif ted downward.  Even if some of that 
decline was a result of decreasing term premiums, it appears that market participants expect rates to remain unchanged for at least as  long as they did at the time of the last 
meeting.  Thus, the release of a statement along the lines of Alternative C would likely cause short- and medium-term interest rates to  rise sharply, and equity prices to drop, 
while the foreign exchange value of the dollar would probably appreciate.  Forward 
inflation compensation might decline over time if the Committee’s decision caused 
investors to mark down their inflati on expectations at longer horizons.
 
THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE  A 
If the Committee views the staff’s econom ic outlook, with its very protracted 
return to full employment, as unacceptably weak despite the upward revision, or if

 participants are not convinced that the recent  data are signaling th e start of a sustained 
economic recovery, policymakers may judge th at additional monetary stimulus would 
be appropriate.  In this case, they could decide to expand the amount of agency MBS 
purchases, be more definitive about the total amount to be purchased, and extend the 
timeframe for conducting those transactions, as in Alternative A .  Although the staff 
has marked up its forecast for economic growth significantly, the unemployment rate declines only slowly—it is pr ojected to be still above 9 percent at the end of next year 
and just under 8 percent at the end of 2011—and core inflation hovers around 1 percent for several years, a level below the inflation objectives implicit in individual 
policymakers’  longer-run projections.  Mo reover, the Committee may judge that the 
staff forecast is overly optimistic on both the growth and inflat ion fronts.  The recent 
better-than-expected data might have been driven importantly by temporary factors 
(like the Cash-for-Clunkers program) and thus, may be overstating the degree of 
underlying momentum of the economy.  Recen t increases in house prices may not be 
sustained if foreclosures rise appreciably faster or by a greater amount than in the 
Greenbook forecast.  If so, the apparent bottoming out in the housing market could 
be illusory.  In addition, the decline in bank lending and M2 may be interpreted as pointing to weaker growth than in the staff forecast.  Given the significant 
deceleration in wages and hourly compensa tion during the recession, policymakers 
might see a significant risk of greater di sinflation than in the staff forecast, as 
discussed in the Greenbook alternative scenario, “Greater Disinflation.” 
Based on the outlook for economic growth an d inflation, as well as the downside 
risks to that outlook, the Committee might c onclude that further monetary stimulus is 
warranted.  In addition, given the experience to date, the Committee may now be 
more confident that the LSAPs are loweri ng mortgage rates and that a further 
expansion in LSAPs would be  effective in supporting aggregate demand.  Based on 
the staff’s ongoing analysi s, the Committee may also be more confident that the 
September 17, 2009

 FOMC has the necessary tools to exit from th is period of extraordinarily low interest 
rates despite a further expansion of the Fede ral Reserve’s balance sheet.  Furthermore, 
the public may have become more confident in the viability of the Federal Reserve’s 
exit strategy now that it has been explai ned in speeches and testimony by Committee 
members and other participants.  Thus, th e perceived benefits of increased LSAPs 
may have risen while the perceived costs may  have declined.  If so, the Committee 
may judge that increasing the LSAPs at this  juncture, even with the improved outlook, 
is desirable for fostering better economic ou tcomes.  Being more explicit that the 
Committee plans to purchase the full $1.5 tr illion, rather than “up to” the increased 
maximum, would likely result in a larger economic impact.   
The Desk would likely encounter challenges if  it were to significantly step up the 
pace of agency MBS purchases.  Thus, the Committee might judge that in order to 
expand the amount of these purchases wi thout having adverse effects on market 
functioning, the timeframe for their completion would need to be expanded.  
Extending the timeframe to the end of the second quarter of 2010 would allow for a gradual reduction in the pace of purchases as they near completion.  Expanding the 
amount of purchases of agency debt (or even buying the maximum $200 billion) 
could generate significant distortions in the markets for those securities, so this is not 
proposed in Alternative A. 
An announcement along the lines of Alternative A would surprise market 
participants.  Judging by recent experience,  the announcement of an additional $250 
billion in agency MBS could generate an init ial drop in mortgage yields and spreads to 
Treasuries.  Equity prices would probably edge up, and th e foreign exchange value of 
the dollar might well decline.  Inflati on compensation could increase if the 
Committee’s decision prompted renewed inve stor concerns about the size of the 
Federal Reserve’s balance sheet and future in flation.  All of these effects could be

  magnified if market participants saw the in crease in asset purchases as opening the 
door to yet further increases in such transactions.

10 Reflecting concerns that a higher level of purchases could distort pricing and compromise 
market liquidity, agency debt purchases are proj ected to cumulate to $150 billion, below the 
announced $200 billion upper limit of the program under Alternatives A and B.   LONG‐RUN PROJECTIONS  OF THE BALANCE  SHEET  AND MONETARY  BASE 
Three balance sheet scenarios are presented in  this section; they differ in terms of 
the size and timing of large-scale asset purchases.  The baseline scenario corresponds 
to the variant of Alternative B in the Po licy Alternatives section, which has agency 
MBS purchases of $1.25 trillion and agen cy debt purchases of $150 billion both 
completed by the end of the first quarter of 2010.  The second scenario corresponds 
to Alternative A, in which purchases of agency MBS are increased by $250 billion to $1.5 trillion and completed by the end of the first quarter of 2010.  Purchases of agency debt are equal to those in the baseli ne in terms of size but are completed by 
the end of this year rather than at the end of the first quarter of 2010.
10  The third 
scenario corresponds to Alternative C, in which the quantity of agency MBS 
purchases is reduced by $250 billion to $1  trillion and agency debt purchases stop at 
$150 billion.  Both sets of  purchases are completed by th e end of 2009.  All scenarios 
include purchases of Treasury securities in line with the quantity and timing previously 
announced by the FOMC, that is $300 billion of total purchases completed by the end 
of October this year.  
To construct the projections, we made a ssumptions about each component of the 
balance sheet.  Details on the assumptions are available in Appendix C.  On the asset side of the balance sheet, the path of la rge-scale asset purchases in the baseline 
scenario matches the assumed path in the Greenbook.  All three scenarios assume that the assets purchased are held to maturity and not replaced.  Due to expected settlement lags and prepayments, agency MBS holdings under each alternative peak at 
a slightly lower level than the total amount purchased and a few months after 
purchases have ceased.  For all scenarios, an assumed slower-than-historical-average

11 A discussion of the issues related to the SD R allocation can be found in the memo to the 
FOMC, “Implications of upcoming SDR allocations,” August 4, 2009. path for the prepayment of agency MBS imp lies that more than half of the agency 
MBS purchased are still on th e balance sheet in 2016. 
The projections for liquidity and credit programs are essentially the same in all 
three scenarios.  The Term Asset-Backed Secu rities Loan Facility  (TALF) is assumed 
to reach a peak of $137 billion at the en d of the second quarter of 2010, with 
$87 billion in three-year loans and $50 bil lion in five-year loans at the peak.  TALF 
loans outstanding reach zero in 2015.  The Commercial Paper Funding Facility 
(CPFF) and the foreign central bank liquidity swap lines are assumed to expire on 
February 1, 2010; funds extended through these facilities wind down to zero by mid-
year 2010.  Credit extended to AIG and th e Federal Reserve’s ownership of preferred 
stock interests in AIG reach zero by 2013.  The assets held by Maiden Lane LLC, 
Maiden Lane II LLC, and Maiden Lane II I LLC are assumed to be sold over time; 
they are essentially nil by 2016.  Primary, secondary, and seasonal credit sum to about 
$1 billion from the end of 2010 forward.  Only the Term Auction Facility (TAF) 
remains sizable beyond 2010 at a steady-state level of $20 billion.  In the near term, 
we assume that the TAF will be scaled do wn.  In particular, the amounts offered at 
84-day auctions will eventually decrease to zero and term lengths will be reduced so 
that these loans mature at the same time as  28-day loans.   By January 2010, only 28-
day auctions will be held.  At the end of 2009, the TAF projection assumes that the 
full amount offered of $125 billion is taken down, but subsequently demand drops 
and the TAF reaches the steady state level by the end of April 2010.  Finally, the 
Special Drawing Rights (SDR) certificate a ccount is projected to increase by $10 
billion, to $12 billion, by the end of 2011 , as a result of an assumed monetization of 
an allocation of SDRs.11

 On the liability side of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet, all three scenarios 
assume that currency (Federal Reserve notes in circulation) grows at the same rate as 
the staff forecast for money stock currency through 2011 and after that point expands 
at the projected growth rate of nominal GDP in the extended Greenbook forecast.   
Reflecting the Treasury’s announcement re garding the Supplementary Financing 
Program (SFP), the Supplementary Financin g Account (SFA) is projected to run 
down to $15 billion by Oct ober 2009 and remain there through the end of the year.  
Subsequently, under the assumption that the Congress raises the debt ceiling, the 
balances in the SFA return to $200 billion during the first quarter of 2010 and remain 
at this level through the end of 2015 in th e baseline scenario.  At this point, reserve 
balances are falling towards $25 billion and, as a result, the SFP is assumed to begin to 
wind down.  The U.S. Treasury is assu med to continue its recent pattern of 
maintaining all of its operati ng balances in the Treasury general account (TGA) over 
the next year.  We assume that the Treasu ry eventually puts in place a new cash 
management system in conjunction with th e implementation of new legislation and 
systems and the TGA then returns to its hist orical level of $5 bi llion in 2011.  All 
other liabilities with the exception of re verse repurchase agreements (with foreign 
official and international accounts) and reserv e balances are assumed to be constant at 
their level as of August 31, 20 09.  Federal Reserve Bank capital is projected to grow in 
line with its average pace of expansion over the past ten years.   
Under all scenarios, the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet expands rapidly over the 
course of 2009.  For the baseline scenar io, the balance sheet reaches a peak of 
$2.4 trillion in the second quart er of 2010 and then declines  to a level of $1.4 trillion 
at the end of the projection period.  For Al ternative A, the peak also occurs in the 
second quarter of 2010 but at a higher level of $2.6 trillion.  Assets then decline to 
roughly $1.6 trillion at the end of 2016.  Fo r Alternative C, the balance sheet peaks at

12 The composition of Federal Reserve assets in all three of these projections differs notably 
from historical patterns.  Prior to August 2007, U.S. Treasury securities were about 90 
percent of assets and the Federal Reserv e did not hold any agency mortgage-backed 
securities.  By contrast, under the baseline scen ario, Treasuries are pr ojected to account for 
only around 33 percent of total assets at the end of 2009 and rise to just 36 percent of total 
assets at the end of the projection period.  $2.2 trillion at the end of 20 09, and assets decline to $1.4  trillion at the end of the 
projection period.12

These projections for liabilities and capita l, combined with the assumed path for 
assets, largely imply a path for reserve bala nces under each scenario.  Note, however, 
that the level of reserve balances was cons idered in determining the projected use of 
credit and liquidity facilities, so the projected path is not purely a residual.  In all three 
scenarios, the implied paths of reserve balan ces rise rapidly until the end of 2009.  The 
timing of the peak and the eventual declin e in the size of the balance sheet differs 
across alternatives, however.  In the scenar ios corresponding to Alternatives A and B, 
reserve balances peak in June of 2010, whereas in Alternative C, they peak in

13 The calculated growth rates of the monetary  base presented in the table are based on an 
approximation for month-average values.  December of this year.  Reserve balances d ecline as the balance sheet shrinks in all 
scenarios, but in Alternative C, a resumpti on of open market purchases is assumed in 
2016 to maintain reserve balances at a level of $25 billion. 
Projections for the growth rates of the monetary base are derived from these 
balance sheet projections as the growth rate  of the sum of Federal Reserve notes in 
circulation and reserve balances.13  After contracting in the third quarter of this year 
the monetary base is projected to expand  rapidly in the fourth quarter under all 
scenarios.  At a quarterly frequency, the mo netary base continues to expand for the 
first three quarters of 2010 for Alternative A and B.  In 2011, however, as securities 
holdings trend lower and the liquidity facilit ies wind down, the monetary base begins 
to contract. For Alternative C, in which asset purchases end in 2009, the monetary 
base begins to contract in the first quarter  of 2010.  For all three alternatives, the 
monetary base continues to contract as assets mature and the balance sheet shrinks.  For Alternatives B and C, this contraction is reversed near the end of the projection 
horizon. 
Relative to the August Bluebook, there ar e a number of notable changes to the 
projections.  The initial size of the balance sheet at the end of August was $95 billion 
lower than projected at the time of the last Bluebook, primarily because agency MBS 
purchases and settlements were smaller than forecasted.  The pattern of purchases of 
agency debt and agency MBS has been modified in the new projections, as the 
completion dates of the programs were extended from the end of this year to the end 
of the first quarter of 2010 under the baseli ne scenario.  For the liquidity and credit 
programs, the projection for th e TAF no longer includes an uptick at the end of the 
year.  The TALF is assumed to extend a somewhat lower volume of loans than 
previously.  Some of the other lending faci lities are now seen as running off slightly

 faster than was projected last round in li ght of the improvement in financial markets 
and more widely available liquidity and credit.  On balance, total assets at year-end 
2009 are about $356 billion lower in this pr ojection compared with that presented in 
the August Bluebook, mostly a result of the change in assumptions about the TAF 
and the timing of agency MBS purchases.  By the end of the projection period in 2016, however, total assets are not much different than the level projected in the August Bluebook because the primary change s to the baseline scenario between the 
two Bluebooks are related to the timing, rath er than the level, of large-scale assets 
purchases.  
On the liabilities side, the staff has made significant changes to the projections 
relative to the August Blueboo k.  The path for the SFA is very different.  In the near 
term, the account is drawn down to a very  low level until the beginning of 2010.  
Thereafter, the account is assumed to return to its previous $200 billion level until the 
program is run down as reserve balances approach $25 billion late in the projection 
period.  In the last Bluebook the SFA was ex pected to be drawn down to zero by the 
second half of 2010.  Moreover, the TGA is  now assumed to return to its historical 
level at the end of 2010 rather than this year.   On net, the level of reserve balances is 
about $244 billion lower at the end of this year, primarily reflecting the slower pace of agency MBS purchases and a lower use of the TAF over year-end.  The level of reserve balances remains considerably below that projected in the August Bluebook 
through the projection period primarily as a result of the new assumption with regards 
to the SFA. 
The extended Greenbook projection shows the target federal funds rate rising 
from the current 0 to ¼ percent range to 2.4 percent over the course of 2012.  Under 
the operating procedures employed before th e financial crisis, the projected level of 
reserve balances at the end of 2012 of approximately $600 billion would not have been consistent with a federal funds rate sign ificantly above zero.  If the interest rate 
September 17, 2009

   paid on excess reserve balances becomes an e ffective floor for the federal funds rate, a 
higher target rate could be achieved even with quite elevated reserve balances simply 
by raising the excess reserves rate.  Such a path is implicit in these projections.  The 
experience last autumn, however, when the e ffective federal funds rate fell well below 
the rate paid on excess reserves, may sugges t that other tools could be needed to 
improve the control over the funds rate.  Su ch tools might include reverse repurchase 
agreements, outright sales of securities, a term  deposit facility, or other strategies.  The 
balance sheet effects of thes e tools, however, are not incl uded in these projections.

 BANK CREDIT , DEBT, AND MONEY FORECAST 
The outlook for nonfederal debt growth and bank credit expansion continues to 
be quite weak, consistent with the staff’s forecast of a moderate economic recovery 
and only gradual improvement in the health of the banking system.  M2 is also likely 
to be weak as a result of slow income gr owth, anemic increases in bank credit, and a 
continued gradual reallocation of house hold wealth toward  riskier assets.  
Bank credit is forecast to contract 4½ percent this year.  This is a sharper drop 
than previously projected and reflects persistent declines in most major loan 
categories through the fourth quarter of 2009 that are only partially offset by purchases of securities.  This  would be the first annual decline in nominal bank credit 
since 1948.  Growth in bank credit is ex pected to increase gradually to about 4¼ 
percent in 2010 and 6½ percent in 2011, a bi t more than in the previous projection, 
reflecting the staff’s improved outlook for ec onomic activity over the forecast period.  
However, loan growth remains particularly weak until late in 2010, partly reflecting concern among lenders about further deterior ation in credit quality and its potential 
impact on their own capital positions. 
Domestic nonfinancial sector debt is projected to expand at an annual rate of 
about [5] percent through 2011, reflecting c ontinued rapid growth of federal debt, a 
moderate rise in state and local government  debt, and a gradual resumption of growth 
in household and business borrowing.  Federa l debt is projected to increase rapidly 
over the forecast period because of continued large deficits.  State and local government borrowing is expected to slow from its recent rapid pace, in part because 
stimulus grants will finance some of the proj ected rise in the sector’s capital outlays.  
Private-sector debt is expected to pick up gradually.  Growth in household debt is 
forecast to begin to edge up early next yea r as the economy improves, but the rise will 
be constrained by the elevated unemploy ment rate, continued deleveraging by

   households, and lending standards that ease only gradually.  Despite expected further 
improvement in conditions in capital marke ts, borrowing by nonfinancial businesses 
is expected to remain sluggish over the next several yea rs, owing to weakness in 
commercial real estate markets and relatively tight lending standards at banks. 
M2 is projected to continue contracting in  the fourth quarter of 2009 and the first 
quarter of 2010 as households reallocate more of their wealth toward riskier assets.  
The contraction is accounted for by substantial declines in small time deposits and retail money market mutual funds, which partly reflect low and declining interest rates 
on those instruments.  Over the course of ne xt year, M2 is forecast to increase less 
rapidly than nominal GDP, as the run-off of safe-haven M2 assets continues amid 
improvements in economic and financial ma rket conditions.  In 2011, the staff 
expects M2 to accelerate to about 5 percen t, somewhat less than the growth rate of 
nominal GDP.

 DIRECTIVE 
The August directive and draft language for the September directive are provided 
below. 
AUGUST FOMC MEETING 
The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that 
will foster price stability and promote sust ainable growth in output.  To further its 
long-run objectives, the Committee seeks c onditions in reserve markets consistent 
with federal funds trading in a range from 0 to ¼ percent.  The Committee directs the 
Desk to purchase agency debt, agency MBS, and longer-term Treasury securities 
during the intermeeting period with the ai m of providing support to private credit 
markets and economic activity.  The timi ng and pace of these purchases should 
depend on conditions in the markets for su ch securities and on a broader assessment 
of private credit market condit ions.  The Desk is expected to purchase up to $200 
billion in housing-related agency debt and up to $1.25 trillion of agency MBS by the 
end of the year.  The Desk is expected to  purchase about $300 billion of longer-term 
Treasury securities by the end of Oct ober, gradually slowing the pace of these 
purchases until they are completed.  Th e Committee anticipates that outright 
purchases of securities will cause the size  of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet to 
expand significantly in coming months.  The System Open Market Account Manager 
and the Secretary will keep the Committe e informed of ongoing developments 
regarding the System’s balance sheet that coul d affect the attainment over time of the 
Committee’s objectives of maximum employment and price stability.

 APPENDIX A:  MEASURES OF THE EQUILIBRIUM  REAL RATE 
The equilibrium real rate is the real federal fund s rate that, if maintained, would be projected to 
return output to its potential level over time.  Th e short-run equilibrium rate is defined as the rate 
that would close the output gap in twelve quar ters given the corresponding model’s projection of 
the economy.  The medium-run concept is the value of the real federal funds rate projected to keep 
output at potential in seven years, under the assum ption that monetary policy acts to bring actual 
and potential output into line in the short run and then keeps them equal thereafter.  The TIPS-
based factor model measure provides an estimate of market expectations for the real federal funds 
rate seven years ahead.  
The actual real federal funds rate is constructed as the difference between the nominal rate and 
realized inflation, where the nominal rate is measured as the quarterly average of the observed federal funds rate, and realized inflation is given by the log difference between the core PCE price 
index and its lagged value four quarters earlier.  If the upcoming FOMC meeting falls early in the 
quarter, the lagged inflation measure ends in the la st quarter.  For the current quarter, the nominal 
rate is specified as the target federal funds rate on the Bluebook publication date.   
Measure  Description  
Single-
equation 
Model The measure of the equilibrium real rate in the single-equation model is based on an 
estimated aggregate-demand relationship between the current value of the output gap and its lagged values as well as the lagged values of the real federal funds rate. 
Small 
Structural 
Model The small-scale model of the economy consists of equations for six variables: the output 
gap, the equity premium, the federal budget surplus, the trend growth rate of output, the real 
bond yield, and the real federal funds rate. 
EDO 
Model Estimates of the equilibrium real rate using EDO—an estimated dynamic-stochastic-
general-equilibrium (DSGE) model of th e U.S. economy—depend on data for major 
spending categories, price and wages, and the federal funds rate as well as the model’s structure and estimate of the output gap. 
FRB/US 
Model Estimates of the equilibrium real rate us ing FRB/US—the staff’s large-scale econometric 
model of the U.S. economy—depend on a very broad array of economic factors, some of 
which take the form of projected values of the model’s exogenous variables. 
Greenbook-
consistent Two measures are presented—based on the FRB/US and the EDO models.  Both models 
are matched to the extended Greenbook forecast .  Model simulations determine the value of 
the real federal funds rate that closes the output gap conditional on the extended baseline. 
TIPS-based 
Factor 
Model Yields on TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Secu rities) reflect investors’ expectations of 
the future path of real interest rates.  The TIPS-based measure of the equilibrium real rate is constructed using the seven-year-ahead instantaneous real forward rate derived from TIPS 
yields as of the Bluebook publication date.  This forward rate is adjusted to remove 
estimates of the term and liquidity premiums based on a three-factor arbitrage-free term-
structure model applied to TIPS yields, nominal yields, and inflation.

 Estimates of the real federal funds rate depend on the proxies for expected inflation used.  The table 
below shows estimated real federal funds rates ba sed on lagged core PCE inflation, the definition 
used in the Equilibrium Real Federal Funds Rate ch art; lagged four-quarter headline PCE inflation; 
and projected four-quarter headline PCE inflation beginning with the next quarter.  For each 
estimate of the real rate, the table also provid es the Greenbook-consistent measure of the short-run 
equilibrium real rate and the average actual real federal funds rate over the next twelve quarters.

  APPENDIX B:  ANALYSIS  OF POLICY PATHS AND CONFIDENCE  INTERVALS 
RULE SPECIFICATIONS    
For the following rules,
 denotes an assumed value of pol icymakers’ long-run in flation 
objective.  The outcome-based and forecast-based ru les were estimated using real-time data over the 
sample 1988:1-2006:4; each specification was chosen  using the Bayesian information criterion. Each 
rule incorporates a 75 basis point shift in the intercept, specified as a se quence of 25 basis point 
increments during the first three quarters of 19 98.  The first two simple rules were proposed by 
Taylor (1993, 1999).  The prescriptions of the fi rst-difference rule do not depend on assumptions 
regarding r* or the level of the output gap; see Orphanides (2003). 
Outcome-based rule it
Forecast-based rule it
Taylor (1993) rule it
Taylor (1999) rule it
First-difference rule it
FRB/US  MODEL SIMULATIONS    
Prescriptions from the two empirical rules are computed using dynamic simulations of the FRB/US 
model, implemented as though the rule were followed starting at this FOMC meeting.  The dotted line labeled “Previous Bluebook” is based on the curre nt specification of the policy rule, applied to 
the previous Greenbook projection.  Confidence intervals  are based on stochastic simulations of the 
FRB/US model with shocks drawn from th e estimated residuals over 1969-2008.  
INFORMATION  FROM  FINANCIAL  MARKETS   
The expected funds rate path is based on Eurodollar quotes and implied three-month forward rates 
from swaps, and the confidence intervals for this path are constructed using prices of interest rate 
caps.  
NEAR‐TERM PRESCRIPTIONS  OF SIMPLE  POLICY  RULES   
These prescriptions are calculated using Greenbook projections for inflation and the output gap. 
Because the first-difference rule involves the lagged funds rate, the value labeled “Previous 
Bluebook” for the current quarter is computed using the actual value of the lagged funds rate, and 
the one-quarter-ahead prescriptions are based on th is rule’s prescription for the current quarter.

 APPENDIX C:  LONG‐RUN PROJECTIONS  OF THE BALANCE  SHEET  AND 
MONETARY  BASE  
This appendix presents more detail on the assumpt ions underlying the long-run projections of the 
Federal Reserve’s balance sheet and the monetary base shown in the section entitled “Long-Run 
Projections of the Balance Sheet and Monetary Base.” 
GENERAL ASSUMPTIONS  
The projections are constructed on a monthly fre quency from September 2009 to December 2016.  
The few balance sheet items that are not discusse d below are assumed to be constant over the 
projection period at the level for August 31, 2009.  The projections for all major asset and liability 
categories are summarized in the charts and table that follow the bullet points. 
ASSETS 
Asset Purchases  
• The baseline scenario incorporates large-scale asset purchases roughly in line with those that 
have been announced. 
o The Desk purchases a total of $300 billion of Treasury securities, $150 billion of agency debt, and $1.25 trillion of agency MBS. 
o Purchases of Treasury securities are expected to be completed by October 2009, and purchases of agency debt and agency MBS ar e to be completed by the end of the 
first quarter of 2010. 
o The maturity distribution of the Treasury securities purchased is based on FRBNY Markets Group internal forecasts.  The ma turities of most purchases are between 
two and ten years, with the weighted averag e maturity being a little over six years. 
o No sales of Treasury securities are assumed, and maturing securities are not rolled over.  As a result, total holdings of Treasury securities decline as issues mature.  Treasury securities held in the SOMA portf olio prior to the initiation of the large-
scale asset purchase are assumed to be reinvested as they mature.   
o Agency debt holdings peak at $147 billion in  March of 2010, and decline slowly over 
the remainder of the forecast horizon as they mature.   
o Due to expected settlement lags and pr epayments, agency MBS holdings peak at 
$1.15 trillion in June 2010, a slightly lower  level than the amount purchased.  For 
agency MBS, the rate of prepayment is based on estimates from one of the investment managers.  The historically low coupon on these securities implies a 
relatively slow prepayment rate.  As a re sult, at the end of 2016, $731 billion of the 
$1.25 trillion of MBS purchased remains on the balance sheet. 
• In the scenario corresponding to Alternative A, purchases of agency MBS are increased by $250 billion to $1.5 trillion and the purchases (but not settlement) are completed by the first 
quarter of 2010. The purchases are spread equally over the coming months until the

14 On March 2, the Federal Reserve and Tr easury jointly announced a restructuring of the gove rnment’s assistance to 
AIG.  As part of this restructuring, the revolving credit facility will be reduced  in exchange for preferred interests in 
two SPVs created to hold all the common stock of two AIG subsidiaries.  It is assumed that the total size of the 
assistance to AIG is not directly affected by this restructuring. completion date. Agency debt purchases amount  to $150 billion and are completed by the 
end of 2009. 
• In the scenario corresponding to Alternative C, purchases of agency MBS are decreased by 
$250 billion to $1 trillion. Moreover, the purcha ses (but not settlement) are completed by the 
end of 2009. Purchases are decreased equally ov er the over the remaining months of 2009. 
Agency debt purchases mirror those in the scenario corresponding to Alternative A.  
• By the end of the projection period in the scenario corresponding to Alternative C, the expansion of currency and capital combined wi th a runoff of other assets necessitates the 
resumption of standard open market purchases to maintain reserve balances at a level of $25 
billion.  It is assumed that the Desk purcha ses Treasury securities to satisfy these needs.  
Liquidity  Programs  and Credit Facilities 
• The assumptions about the liquidity programs and credit facilities are the same across 
Alternatives. 
• Primary credit is assumed to decline moderately from its current level to $1 billion by the end of 2010 and remain at that level thereafter .  Secondary credit is assumed to be zero for 
the entire projection period. 
• Only the Term Auction Facility (TAF) remains sizable beyond 2010 at a steady-state level of $20 billion.  In the near term, we assume that  the TAF will be scaled down.  In particular, 
the amounts offered at 84-day auctions will eventu ally decrease to zero and term lengths will 
be reduced so that these loans mature at the same time as 28-day loans.  By January 2010, 
only 28-day auctions will be held.  At the end of 2009, the TAF projection assumes that the full amount offered of $125 billion is taken down, but subsequently demand drops and the 
TAF reaches the steady state level by the end of April 2010.  
• Foreign central bank liquidity swaps decline with improved market functioning and fall to zero a few months following the expiration date of the program on February 1, 2010.   
• Credit extended to and preferred stock interes ts in AIG wind down by the end of 2013.
14  In 
addition, the assets held by Maiden Lane LLC, Maiden Lane II LLC, and Maiden Lane III 
LLC are assumed to be sold over time  and reach a nominal level by 2016.   
• The Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Fac ility (TALF), based partly on its slow initial 
uptake, is assumed to peak at $137 billion in June 2010, well below the $1 trillion limit. 
o TALF loans with a three-year maturity reach $87 billion by the program’s assumed expiration date of March 31, 2010.  A porti on of these loans are expected to prepay, 
and the quantity outstanding reaches zero by the end of the first quarter of 2013. 
o TALF loans with a five-year maturity reach $50 billion by the end of June 2010.  
These loans are assumed to be held to ma turity, and the quantity outstanding reaches 
zero by the end of 2015. 
• Reflecting improvements in market conditions, the Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility (AMLF) and Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF)

  are expected to continue to be unused.  Credit extended through the Commercial Paper 
Funding Facility (CPFF) winds down to zero a few months after the facility expires on 
February 1, 2010.  
Other 
• The Special Drawing Rights (SDR) certificate acco unt is projected to increase by $10 billion, 
to $12 billion, by the end of 2011, as a result of  an assumed monetization of the allocation of 
SDRs. 
LIABILITIES 
• Currency (Federal Reserve notes in circulation) grows in line with the staff forecast for money stock currency through the end of 2011.  From 2011 to the end of the projection period, currency grows at the same rate as  nominal GDP as projected in the extended 
Greenbook forecast. 
• The U.S. Treasury’s general account (TGA) is projected to follow the Staff forecast of 
Treasury’s end of period total cash balance without the Supplementary Financing Program 
(SFP) through March 2010.  In essence, this assumption implies that the Treasury continues to maintain all of its operating cash at the Fe deral Reserve over that period. Thereafter, the 
TGA returns to its historical target level of $5  billion by the end of 2010.  This account 
remains constant at that level over the forecast period. 
• In the near term, movements in the Treasury’s Supplementary Financing Account (SFA) reflect constraints Treasury faces with the debt limit.  Reflecting the Treasury’s announcement regarding the SFP, the SFA is projected to run down to $15 billion by October 2009 and remain there through the end of the year.  Subsequently, under the assumption that the Congress raises the debt ceiling, the balances in the SFA return to $200 billion during the first quarter of 2010 and remain s at this level through the end of 2015.  At 
this point, reserve balances are falling towards $25 billion and, as a result, the Supplementary Financing Program is assumed to run down. 
• Reverse repurchase agreements with foreign of ficial and international accounts are expected 
to decrease to $30 billion by the end of 2009 as these funds move to other investments.   
• Capital is expected to grow at 15 percent per year, in line with the average rate of the past 
ten years. 
• As the asset side of the balance sheet expands and contracts, so do reserve balances.  Over the projection period, reserve balances in the ba seline scenario are expected to peak at $1.2 
trillion and then fall to $25 billion.
