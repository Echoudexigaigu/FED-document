 CLASS I FOMC  - RESTRICTED CONTROLLED (FR)
MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES
PREPARED FOR THE FEDERAL OPEN MARKET COMMITTEE  
BY THE STAFF OF THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM  DECEMBER 10, 2009 
 
                                            
1 The effective federal funds rate averaged 0. 12 percent over the intermeeting period, and the 
intraday standard deviation averaged 3.3 basis points.  RECENT DEVELOPMENTS  
SUMMARY 
Financial market conditions became so mewhat more supportive of economic 
growth over the intermeeting period, but banks apparently continued to tighten the 
terms of credit.  The expected path of m onetary policy moved lower, on net, as did 
yields on most fixed-income securities.  Broad equity indexes rose amid generally 
positive economic data, and the dollar was mixed against the major currencies.  Consistent with a continued return toward  normal functioning in funding markets, 
borrowing from Federal Reserve faci lities edged down further.   
Corporate bond and equity issuance was solid in November, but the level of 
commercial bank credit contin ued to decline, albeit at a slower pace than in recent 
months.  Asset-backed security (ABS) issuan ce picked up in November, and, with the 
support of the Term Asset-Backed Securi ties Loan Facility (TALF), the first 
commercial mortgage-backed security (CMBS)  issuance in nearly 18 months came to 
market.  Domestic nonfinancial sector debt is projected to expand in the fourth quarter at an annual rate of about 1½  percent, weighed down by a continued 
contraction in the debt of both households and businesses. 
MONETARY  POLICY  EXPECTATIONS  AND TREASURY  YIELDS 
Implied rates on federal funds and Eurodoll ar futures have moved lower since the 
November FOMC meeting.1  Although the decision to keep the target range for the 
federal funds rate unchanged at that meet ing and to retain the “extended period” 
language in the accompanying statement was largely anticipated, market participants

 took note of the Committee’s ex plicit enumeration of the fa ctors that are expected to 
continue to warrant this policy, and Eurodo llar futures rates fell a bit on the release.  
Market participants’ perception that the federal funds rate will likely remain near its 
current level for an extended period appeared  to be reinforced by subsequent Federal 
Reserve communications, most notably Ch airman Bernanke’s speech on November 
16.  Incoming economic data were, on bala nce, somewhat better than expected, but 
their net impact on interest rate expectations appeared to be small.  Consistent with a net reduction in realized and implied volatility in short-term rates, staff models 
suggest that a decrease in term premiums may  also have contributed to the decline in 
futures rates since early November.   
Under the staff’s usual term-premium assu mption of 1 basis point per month, the 
path of the federal funds rate implied by futures quotes now lifts off from the current 
target range in the third quarter of 2010 and reaches about 2 percent by the end of 
2011.  That expectation apparently prices in some low-probability scenarios that 
would entail substantial rate increases.  Quot es from the market for interest rate caps 
suggest that the most likely path of the fe deral funds rate—that is, the mode of the 
distribution, rather than the mean—does no t move above 25 basis points until around 
the beginning of 2011 and rises by about 70 basis points over the subsequent year 
(Chart 1). 
The readings from financial-market quote s are roughly consistent with results 
from the December survey of primary dealers, according to which about two-thirds of 
respondents expect the first rate increase to occur by the end of 2010, a slightly larger 
fraction than in the October survey.  Dealers generally do not anticipate major changes to the FOMC statemen t at the upcoming meeting, although several do expect 
some revision to reflect an improvement in the economic outlook.  In a new question, 
dealers were asked how many meetings in adva nce of the first increase in the target

 rate they expected the phrase “extended period” to be removed from the statement.  
Although responses varied considerab ly, most clustered around three.  
Consistent with the declin e in short-term interest rates, yields on two-year 
nominal off-the-run Treasury securities fell 18 basis points over the intermeeting 
period; ten-year yields were down only slig htly.  Trading volumes in nominal issues 
remained within their recent range, and meas ures of liquidity in the coupon market 
were roughly stable.  TIPS yi elds fell slightly more than their nominal counterparts, on 
net, leaving inflation compensation up a fe w basis points across the term structure.  
Five-year inflation compensation five years  ahead remained near the upper end of its 
historical range.  Some of the decline in TIPS yields may owe to the Treasury 
Borrowing Advisory Committee’s recommendation that total TIPS issuance for 2010 be increased to between $70 and $80 billion—a significantly smaller amount than 
traders had expected.  Survey measures of s hort-term inflation expectations declined a 
little, while changes in survey measures of longer-term expectations were mixed.  
The Treasury auctioned approximately $2 70 billion in nominal coupon debt of 
various maturities over the intermeeting pe riod.  The auctions were generally well 
received, with bid-to-cover ratios mostly at the upper end of their recent ranges.  
Trends in indirect participation in these auctions, as well as anecdotal reports, 
continued to suggest resilient foreign demand for Treasury securities.  In its quarterly 
refunding statement on November 4, the Treasury announced the discontinuation of 20-year TIPS and the re-introduction of 30-year TIPS, actions that were broadly in 
line with market expectations.  As of D ecember 9, debt subject to limit was only 
about $80 billion below the statutory debt ceiling of $12.1 trillion.  Although the debt 
limit is looming and may become binding in the near term, as in the past, the Treasury will likely be able to employ accounting  tools, if necessary, to continue to make 
payments as scheduled for some ti me after the turn of the year.

 CAPITAL MARKETS 
Broad equity price indexes rose about 5 percent over the intermeeting period, 
partly in response to a somewhat improv ed economic outlook (Chart 2).  Also 
contributing to the increase were third- quarter earnings for S&P 500 firms, which 
logged another solid gain, and upward revi sions to analysts’ expectations of year-
ahead earnings for S&P 500 firms.  In addition, the implied volatility of equity prices, 
as gauged by the VIX index, declined.  Me anwhile, the equity premium—as measured 
by the staff’s estimate of the expected real  return on equity over the next ten years 
relative to the real 10-year yield on Trea sury securities—remaine d about unchanged at 
a relatively high level. 
 Financial-sector shares, on the whol e, underperformed the broader market 
since the November FOMC meeting as in vestors continued to express concerns 
about the future profitability of the bank ing industry.  Indeed, third-quarter Call 
Reports show continued broad deteriorat ion in measures of loan quality at 
commercial banks, suggesting that loss provis ioning will remain a drag on earnings for 
some time.  Nonetheless, equity prices of both large and smaller banks moved higher 
over the period, and spreads on credit de fault swaps (CDS) for large bank holding 
companies fell a bit.  Although U.S. bank  stock prices retreated somewhat on the 
news of the standstill on Dubai World debt, these moves were partially reversed as it 
became clear that domestic banks’ direct exposures were low. 
In the corporate bond market, yields on investment-grade and speculative-grade 
issues fell a little more than those on nomin al Treasuries, leaving their spreads a touch 
narrower.  In the secondary market for leveraged loans, bid prices changed little after a run-up over the previous several month s.  On balance, the credit quality of 
nonfinancial firms appears to have remained steady over the period.  Based on data 
through November, the pace of nonfinancial corporate ratings downgrades by

2 On December 10, CIT confirmed that it had emerged from bankruptcy, having satisfied 
the conditions of its prepackaged reorganizatio n plan.  The distribution of CIT’s new debt 
and equity took place in accordance with th e plan, and the new common stock commenced 
trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Moody’s is estimated to have been modera te in the fourth quarter.  The pace of 
upgrades picked up notably in November, although bonds of a single domestic 
automaker accounted for most of this ch ange.  The year-ahead expected default 
frequency for nonfinancial firms from  Moody’s KMV was little changed in 
November; this measure of default risk ha s declined sharply from the peak reached 
early this year but is still elevated by historical standards.   
Gross issuance of investment-grade bonds by nonfinancial corporations 
rebounded in November following a lull in October, and speculative-grade bond 
issuance maintained its solid third-quarter pace (Chart 3).  In the primary market for 
syndicated leveraged loans, signs of a recovery  emerged, with issuer s trickling back to 
the market and in some cases completing su ccessful syndications.  By contrast, both 
commercial paper outstanding and commercial and industrial (C&I) loans on banks’ 
books contracted again in November.  Gro ss public equity issuance by nonfinancial 
firms remained solid in November, supporte d by the continued strength of initial 
offerings.  The recent weakness in announcem ents of new share repurchase programs 
persisted, while announcements of merger s and acquisitions continued to rebound.  
For financial firms, gross bond issuance sl owed somewhat further following the 
October 31 expiration of the FDIC’s Te mporary Liquidity Guarantee Program.  
Financial firms’ equity issuance was again sl uggish in November, but Bank of America 
issued nearly $20 billion of common-e quivalent shares in early December in 
conjunction with its repayment of $45 bill ion in funds received through the Troubled 
Asset Relief Program.2

3 Market participants have reportedly also ex pressed considerable concern about a provision 
in the regulatory reform bill as recently re ported out of the House Financial Services 
Committee that would allow the FDIC to impose  haircuts of 20 percent on the assets of 
secured creditors, including parties in repurchase agreements, during the resolution of 
systemically important non-bank financial institutions.  Amen dments have been proposed 
that would limit this provision.  It is unclear at  this time how this issue will ultimately be 
resolved by the House of Representatives. Municipal bond issuance remained robust in  November, and the ratio of yields on 
such instruments to comparable-maturity Tr easury securities was about unchanged.  
Newly acquired ratings data from Moody’s show that credit quality in the municipal 
sector deteriorated over the first three qua rters of 2009, a trend that, until recently, 
had been obscured in the ratings data from Standard and Poor’s as a result of a 
gradual shift in its rating methodology for this sector.  
The average interest rate on 30-year confor ming fixed-rate mortgages fell to 4¾ 
percent over the intermeeting period, and the spread between the mortgage rate and 
the 10-year Treasury yield narrowed.  Yiel ds on agency mortgage-backed securities 
(MBS) decreased, on balance, and net issuance of MBS by Fannie Mae and Freddie 
Mac remained sluggish in October amid rela tively strong demand for FHA loans.  Led 
by auto-loan securitizations, consumer AB S issuance increased in  November.  While 
credit card ABS issuance was very low in October and November, it is set to pick up substantially in December as a result of interim FDIC guidance that clarifies how the 
FDIC would handle these securitiza tions for a bank in receivership.

“Effect of FAS 166 and FAS 197 on Commercial Banks.”) 
The announcement in the FOMC statem ent that the Federal Reserve would 
purchase only about $175 billion of agency  debt securities had not been generally 
anticipated, and spreads on those securities  widened a few basis points following the 
release.  Market participants noted further tapering of the MBS purchase program and the apparent onset of tapering in the agency  debt purchase program.  Investors have

The Effects of FAS 166 and FAS 167 on Commercial  Banks 
Last June, the Financial Accounting Standards Board published two new 
accounting standards—commonly referred to as FAS 166 and FAS 167—that will 
change the basis for determining whethe r firms are required to consolidate 
securitized assets (as well as the associated  liabilities and equity) onto their balance 
sheets.1  The new standards focus on the degree of control that the firm exercises 
over the assets, whereas the previous standards were more focused on the firm’s 
credit exposure to the assets.    
Board staff believes that most credit card securitizations and asset-backed 
commercial paper conduits will need to be consolidated, as will the portion of 
private label mortgage-backed securitizati ons and other term securitizations for 
which the originator retains both servicing rights and an economic interest in the securitization.
2  Most banks will apply the new standards as of the March 31, 2010 
Call Report.  Industry analysts estimate th at the amount of assets that will be 
brought onto banks’ balance sheets at that ti me is likely to exceed $1 trillion, with 
the amount highly concentrated at a hand ful of large banking institutions.   
The consolidation of these assets is likel y to significantly reduce the regulatory 
capital ratios of several large banks that  are heavily involved in securitization, 
particularly monoline credit card banks.3  Rating agencies reportedly have already 
been evaluating capital adequacy on the basis of the firms’ combined on- and off-
balance sheet assets, so the accounting change is not expected to have adverse 
implications for banking institutions’ cr edit ratings.  Moreover, the Supervisory 
Capital Assessment Program incorporated  estimates of the effect of the 
consolidation for most securitizations, and staff estimate that the regulatory capital 
ratios of each highly affected bank will remain above key regulatory thresholds even 
after implementing FAS 166 and 167.  Even so, it is possible that some banks may 
respond to the decline in their reported capi tal ratios by restrict ing lending in order 
to offset at least some of the effect of the consolidation.  Partly in response to 
                                                             
1 Statement of Financial Accoun ting Standards No. 166 (FAS 166), Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets (an 
amendment to FASB Statement No. 140) ; and FAS 167, Amendments to FIN 46R, Consoli dation of Variable Interest 
Entities .  FAS 166 and 167 must be implemented with firms’ fi rst financial reporting period that begins after 
November 15, 2009.   
2 A small fraction of ABCP conduits failed to meet the requirements for off-balance-sheet treatment under 
the old accounting rules.  In those situations, the bank ing agencies’ regulations allowed the sponsoring firm 
not to consolidate the conduits for the calculation of risk-based capital ratios.  The agencies are in the process 
of eliminating this exemption.  
3 Some banks’ leverage ratios will be affected more than their risk-based capital ratios  because they provided 
support to their credit card securitiz ation structures over the past year and thus were required to report higher 
risk-weighted assets in their 2009 regulatory filings.

these concerns, the Division of Banking Supervision and Regulation is working 
with the other bank regulatory agencies on a final rule that would phase in the 
effect of the accounting changes on risk-bas ed capital ratios over as much as one 
year.4   
The changes in accounting treatment have  also led the FDIC to reconsider its 
handling of securitized assets in receivershi ps; the specific details of the new rules 
the FDIC is developing in this area co uld have significant consequences for the 
recovery of securitization markets.  Prior to the accounting changes, the FDIC 
granted securitized assets that qualifie d for off-balance-sheet treatment a safe 
harbor under which the assets would not  be subject to stays or seizure in 
receivership, thereby providing investors with assurance of timely payment of 
principal and interest on the debt.  The FDIC recently announced that 
securitizations completed before Marc h 31, 2010 that comply with the old 
accounting rules for off-balance-sheet trea tment will continue to be granted this 
safe harbor treatment.   FDIC staff is consulting with staff members at the Board 
and the other supervisory agencies in their effort to develop new safe harbor provisions for securitizations completed after March 2010.  
  
                                                             
4 The regulatory leverage ratio is designed to be a GAAP-based a ssessment of the balance sheet as a 
supplement to the risk-based capital rules.  Because the af fected banks’ leverage ratios are expected to remain 
above regulatory minimums, the agencies decided to retain the strict GAAP fo cus and require banks to 
recognize the effect of the consolidations on the leverage ratio immediately.

 reportedly continued to express some uncert ainty about several matters related to the 
GSEs over the coming weeks,  including the expiration of the Treasury’s GSE liquidity 
facility at year-end, the extent of the Trea sury’s authority to provide additional capital 
going forward, the termination of the Federal Reserve’s and Treasury’s large-scale 
asset purchase programs, and the portfolio reductions required of the agencies under 
the terms of their conservatorship.  To date , these concerns do not appear to have put 
substantial pressure on agency debt or MBS prices.   
MARKET FUNCTIONING  AND FEDERAL RESERVE PROGRAMS 
Conditions in short-term funding mar kets were little changed over the 
intermeeting period.  One- and three-mont h Libor-OIS spreads were flat, while six-
month spreads edged down somewhat further.  Spreads on A2/P2-rated commercial paper and AA-rated ABCP were little change d, remaining at the low end of their 
ranges over the past two years.  There were  few signs of significant year-end pressures 
in the commercial paper market or in bank  funding markets.  In the Treasury bill 
market, however, year-end pressures were mo re evident, with high demand for bills 
maturing just past December 31 pushing yiel ds on several such bills to zero.  The 
relative scarcity of Treasury bills has b een exacerbated by the recent reduction in 
supplementary financing bills.  The combin ation of scarce collateral and abundant 
liquidity is also reportedly putting downward  pressure on term general collateral repo 
rates.  Separately, the Federal Reserve Bank  of New York announced that it would 
conduct a series of small-scale triparty  repurchase agreements to ensure the 
operational readiness of this tool, and it ca rried out four such operations in early 
December.  Neither the announcements nor the operations themselves elicited 
material price action. 
Indicators of how well other markets are functioning also showed no recent 
deterioration.  Bid-asked spreads on corporate bonds, Treasury securities, and

 leveraged loans moved sideways, and the average range of CDS dealer quotes was 
about unchanged.  In Treasury coupon mar kets, on-the-run premiums and yield-curve 
fitting errors stayed within their recent ranges. 
Supported by the TALF, ABS issuance picked  up in November and $400 million 
of CMBS came to market—the first CMBS  issuance since June 2008.  (See box 
entitled “Balance Sheet Developments.”)  Two other single-borrower CMBS deals 
came to market without TALF support, reflecting improved investor appetite for the 
asset class.   
FOREIGN MARKET DEVELOPMENTS  
On net, the dollar depreciated about ½ percent on a trade-weighted basis 
against both the major currencies and the cu rrencies of our other important trading 
partners over the intermeeting period (Cha rt 4).  The dollar declined early in the 
period, apparently due in part to a cont inued normalization of risk attitudes.  
Additionally, the dollar fell broadly after the meeting of the G-20 ministers over the 
weekend of November 7-8, with market participants noting that the meeting’s 
communiqué failed to mention concern over the dollar’s recent depreciation.  Late in 
the period, however, the dollar reversed course and appreciated sharply following the 
release of the stronger-than-expected Nove mber employment report.  The U.S. dollar 
depreciated another 3 percent against th e yen over the intermeeting period, and 
Japanese officials have voiced unease ov er the yen’s strength.  Several emerging 
economies, including Brazil and Korea, intervened to stem the appreciation of their currencies, while others are reportedly cont emplating tightening capital controls.  
Foreign stock markets generally rose on net,  with notable gains in Brazil and Mexico, 
amid increasing commodity prices and a better-than-expected Mexican GDP report.  China’s stock market climbed 4 percent, in  part due to strong trade data, while 
European equity indexes rose by 2 percen t.  Japanese equities were unchanged on

Balance Sheet Developments  during the Intermeeting  Period 
Since the November FOMC meeting, the Federal Reserve’s total assets have 
edged up to about $2.2 trillion.1  As a result of ongoing asset purchases, securities 
held outright increased by $89 billion, which more than offset a $71 billion decline 
in lending through liquidity and credit facilities. 
The Open Market Desk purchased $9 bil lion in agency debt securities and $80 
billion in agency mortgage-backed securiti es (MBS) during the intermeeting period.2  
In contrast, most of the System’s liquidity and credit programs contracted further, 
consistent with continued improvements in global bank funding markets.  Term 
auction credit declined $53 billion, foreig n central bank liquidity swaps declined $15 
billion, and primary credit declined $3 billion.3  Net portfolio holdings of 
Commercial Paper Funding Facility LLC (CPFF) declined slightly to $14 billion.  Lending under the Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF), loans extended under 
the Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility 
(AMLF), and securities lent through the Term  Securities Lending Facility (TSLF) all 
remained at zero.
4 
The Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF) expanded slightly in 
size to $44 billion.  Three subscriptions  were conducted during the intermeeting 
period, two of which have settled.  The firs t loan subscription, totaling $1.1 billion, 
financed the issuance of asset-backed secu rities (ABS) collateralized by credit card, 
equipment, floorplan, small business, and student loans.  The second subscription 
included $1.4 billion in loan requests to finance purchases of legacy commercial 
mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) and $7 2 million in loan requests to finance 
purchases of the first newly issued CMBS since June 2008.  About three-fourths of 
the newly issued TALF-eligible CMBS we re purchased by non-TALF investors.  
The third subscription, which settles December 10, garnered loan requests totaling 
$3.1 billion and will finance the issuance of ABS collater alized by credit card, 
equipment, floorplan, servicing advan ces, small business, and student loans.5  More 
                                                             
1 These data are through December 9, 2009. 
2 The figures for securities holdings reflect only trades  that have settled.  Over the intermeeting period, the 
Open Market Desk committed to purcha se, but has not yet settled, an additi onal $113 billion of MBS, on net. 
3 On November 17, 2009 the Federal Reserve Board an nounced a reduction in the maximum maturity of 
primary credit loans at the discount window to 28 da ys, effective January 14, 2010.  There was no market 
reaction to the announcement. 
4 Securities lent through the TSLF do not affect th e level of Federal Reserve assets because the Federal 
Reserve retains ownership of the securities lent. 
5 On November 19, 2009, the assets and liabilities of TALF LLC were consolidated with the assets and 
liabilities of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, consistent with generally accepte d accounting principles.

than half of the ABS brought to market with this subscription were financed 
through TALF, a substantial pickup fr om recent months.  The subscription 
included student loan and credit card ABS,  which tend to be more heavily financed 
through TALF.  Approximately $1 billion of TALF loans were prepaid over the 
intermeeting period. 
In conjunction with the restructuring of the government’s support for 
American International Group (AIG) a nnounced on March 2, 2009, the Federal 
Reserve Bank of New York received $25 bil lion of preferred interests in two special 
purpose vehicles, AIA Aurora LLC and ALICO Holdings LLC on December 1 and 
reduced the balance and amount available of revolving credit provided to AIG by a 
commensurate amount.  These two limited liability companies were created to hold 
all of the outstanding common stock of  American International Assurance 
Company (AIA) and American Life Insurance Company (ALICO), two life insurance subsidiaries of AIG. 
On the liability side of the Federal Rese rve’s balance sheet, the U.S. Treasury’s 
general account decreased $25 billion, and the Treasury’s supplementary financing account remained unchanged at $15 billio n.  Reserve balances of depository 
institutions increased $41 billion over the intermeeting period. 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                 
Currently, the LLC has only about $270 million in assets, funded by a commitment fee paid by the Federal 
Reserve Bank of New York and initial funding from the TARP.

  balance.  Foreign sovereign yields generally declined since the November FOMC 
meeting. 
Although the central banks of the major foreign industrial economies kept policy 
rates on hold, there were some noteworthy changes to other policy measures.  The 
Bank of England incr
eased its Asset Purcha se Facility by a somewhat smaller-than-
expected £25 billion to £200 billion.  The European Centra l Bank took some initial 
steps toward scaling back emergency lendin g by announcing that the upcoming one-
year refinancing operation on December 16 will be  its last of that tenor and that funds 
will be offered at a rate equal to the aver age of the benchmark rates set in the weekly 
main refinancing operations over the life of the operation.  Amid concerns about 
deflation and the strength of the yen, the Bank of Japan announced an additional ¥10 
trillion three-month secured lending facilit y at an unscheduled meeting on December 
1, but this move is not expected to have substantial effects.   
News that the Dubai government had requested a standstill on debts owed by 
Dubai World, a government-owned corporation, temporarily roiled financial markets.  Global equity markets and sovereign bond yields fell immediately following the 
announcement, while the dollar rose roughly 1 percent, as investors pulled back from 
riskier investments on concerns that probl ems in Dubai could have knock-on effects 
elsewhere.  However, these movements su bsequently eased somewhat as investors 
concluded that Dubai World’s difficulties were likely to be isolated and not spill over 
to other markets.  Concerns about the potential for default by some sovereign nations 
also rose over the period, most notably for Greece, whose sovereign debt rating was 
lowered because of long-standing c oncerns over its public finances.

4 The average spread is weighted by loan size, with a maximum size of $25 million, and 
adjusted for changes in non-p rice loan characteristics. DEBT, BANK CREDIT , AND MONEY 
The level of private-sector debt is projected  to have fallen slightly in the fourth 
quarter on a further decline in household debt and a tick down in nonfinancial 
business debt (Chart 5).  The growth of federal government debt slowed somewhat 
from its recent rapid pace, while state and lo cal government debt continued to expand 
at a moderate rate.  All told, the growth ra te of domestic nonfinancial-sector debt is 
projected to have declined from an annual rate of 2½ percent in the third quarter to 
about 1½ percent in the fourth quarter. 
Commercial bank credit is estimated to have decreased further in November, 
although the pace of decline slowed relative  to October.  Total loans contracted in 
November at an annual rate of about 4 per cent while securities decreased at a pace of 
about 2½ percent.  (See box entitled “C ommercial Bank Loan Growth and Bank 
Health.”)  C&I loans fell at a 16 percen t rate, likely reflecting weak demand and a 
continued tightening of terms.  The Surv ey of Terms of Business Lending (STBL) 
conducted in November indicated that the average C&I loan rate spread over 
comparable-maturity market instruments rose  for the fifth consecutive survey; the 
increase was broadly apparent across most loan categories.4  The decline in 
commercial real estate loans continued, consistent with the further weakening of fundamentals in that sector.  On the househo ld side, a slowdown in loan sales to the 
GSEs resulted in a 5½ percent increase in on-balance-sheet holdings of closed-end 
residential mortgages in November.  However, home equity loans fell again.  Consumer loans originated by banks also declined sharply as credit card loan 
originations dropped.

Commercial  Bank Loan Growth and Bank Health 
Decomposing the change in total loans and leases on the books of domestic 
banks into two components – the change at “strong” banks and the change at “weak” 
banks – reveals that in 2009, unlike in 19 90-1993, loan portfolios have contracted at 
strong as well as weak banks.   
Strong banks are defined here as banks 
with CAMELS ratings of 1 or 2 and weak 
banks as those with ratings of 3, 4, or 5.1  
Over the past two years, CAMELS downgrades have been widespread, and as 
the top figure shows, at the beginning of the 
third quarter, weak banks held more than 40 
percent of all loans outstanding, nearly as 
large a share as in the early 1990s.
2 
As shown in the second panel, the 
growth rates of loans at strong and weak banks generally move in parallel, with the 
growth rate at weak banks consistently 
running well below that at strong banks.  
This difference presumably is a result of 
greater concerns about asset quality and the 
high cost of funding at weak banks, which 
may cause such banks to constrain lending.  
It may also reflect the relatively poor 
condition of the customers of weak banks, 
and their resulting lower demand for loans. 
The panel at the top of the next page puts these pieces together, showing the 
four-quarter percent change in total loans held by all domestic banks (the black line) 
as well as colored vertical bars representi ng the contributions to the aggregate growth 
rate from strong (blue) and weak (red) banks (that is, the percent change of loans at 
banks in each category multiplied by th e share of loans held by banks in that 
category).  As can be seen, during the ea rly 1990s, the sharp contraction in loans at 
weak banks accounted for the bulk of the runoff in aggregate loans, while lending at 
strong banks contracted only slightly. 
                                                             
1 This classification of weak banks may differ from ot her classifications, including the FDIC’s “problem bank” 
classification, which includes ba nks with ratings of 4 or 5. 
2 However, in the recent period a number of strong bank s received government assistance, such as TARP funds, 
which likely contributed to regulators’ favorable assessment of their health.

Similarly, in the current period, the significant increase in the fraction of industry 
loans held by weak banks and the substantial contraction in loans held at those banks 
have accounted for much of the decline in U. S. bank loans.  In a ddition, in the current 
period strong banks have contributed importantly to this contraction.  The declines at both strong and weak banks in the current episode suggest that a confluence of 
factors is affecting lending across the in dustry.  These factors include widespread 
weakness in loan demand from creditworthy borrowers as a result of the sharp economic slowdown, and reduced loan supply,  perhaps reflecting concerns about the 
economic outlook and balance sheet constraints. 
The significance of supply factors is ev ident in recent Se
 nior Loan Officer 
Opinion Surveys.  Similar fractions of strong and weak banks tightened lending 
standards during the first three quarters of 2009.3  This was also the case during the 
early 1990s.4  This similarity across weak and strong banks indicates that deterioration 
in the condition of banks is only one factor  inducing banks to tighten their lending 
standards.  In contrast, demand reportedly fell  more at weak banks in the first quarter 
of 2009, which may explain part of the la rger decline in loans observed at those 
institutions.  
 
                                                             
3 We average responses to questions on lending standards for differe nt loan categories at the bank level, and then 
across strong and weak banks. 
4 The SLOOS panel contained 6 or fewer weak banks be tween 1993Q4 and 2008Q4, making it difficult to make 
comparisons during that period.

   According to Call Report data, the aggregate profitability of the banking sector 
edged into positive territory in the third quarter, but most of the increase was due to a 
few large institutions that reported signif icant decreases in loan-loss provisioning, 
even as industry-wide measures of credit quality appeared to worsen.  Regulatory 
capital ratios increased further in the thir d quarter as banks received equity infusions 
from their parent holding companies and sh rank their balance sheets.  Unused loan 
commitments contracted for the seventh consecutive quarter, though the rate of decline slowed, especially for commitm ents to lend to businesses.   
 M2 expanded at a 4½ percent annual rate in November, in line with its modest 
growth in September and October.  As ha s been the case in recent months, liquid 
deposits grew rapidly, while small time de posits and retail money market mutual funds 
continued to contract, albeit at slightly sl ower paces.  Currency ran off at a 5 percent 
annual rate in November, likely reflect ing weak demand for U.S. banknotes from 
abroad, consistent with the continued stabi lization in most global financial markets.  
The monetary base expanded at an annualiz ed pace of about 50 percent last month, 
reflecting the continued strong growth in re serve balances due to ongoing large-scale 
asset purchases, which more than offset th e decreased usage of liquidity and credit 
facilities.

5 Purchases of $300 billion in Treasury securiti es were completed at the end of October.  
Purchases of $1.25 trillion in agency MBS and $175 billion in agency debt are projected to 
be finished by the end of the first quarter of 2010. ECONOMIC  OUTLOOK 
Information received over the intermeeting period has been largely consistent 
with the staff projection prov ided in the October Greenbook.  As a result, the staff 
has made only modest changes to its foreca st, with the trajectories for output and 
inflation revised up a bit.  The staff continues to expect that the expansion of real 
GDP will outpace the rise in potential outp ut, causing the output gap to narrow over 
the next couple of years.  As was the case in  the last forecast, the expected level of the 
unemployment rate declines over time as  the output gap narrows, but it ends the 
projection period slightly higher than in the previous projection because the staff has 
raised its estimates of the boost to labor  force participation from extended and 
emergency unemployment benefits.  The ra tes of core and total PCE inflation are 
expected to slow appreciably further over the next two years, with both running a 
little above 1 percent in 2011.   
The staff assumes that the federal funds ra te will remain in its current range for 
the next seven quarters and then begin to rise in the last quarter of 2011, a slightly 
earlier start to policy tightening than in th e October forecast.  No significant changes 
have been made to the assumptions regard ing the sizes or timing of the Federal 
Reserve’s LSAP programs.5  Fiscal policy is expected to  add about 1 percentage point 
to real GDP growth in 2010, the same as in the current year, but to impose a slight 
drag on growth in 2011.  House prices are projected to decline over the next year as 
foreclosure activity continues, but then to rise a bit in 2011.

 The rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages and longer-term Treasuries are 
projected to rise through 2011, with the sp read between them widening a bit as the 
Federal Reserve completes its purchases of  agency MBS.  By contrast, yields on 
investment-grade corporate bonds are expected  to edge down as risk spreads narrow 
considerably further against a backdrop of  continued improvements in financial 
markets and the economic outlook.  With th e equity risk premium also expected to 
narrow, stock prices are proj ected to rise briskly at an annual rate of around 15 
percent over the next two years.  Bank le nding conditions for firms and households 
are anticipated to ease over time but to remain tight by historical standards.  The real 
foreign exchange value of the dollar is assumed to fall at about a 2¼ percent pace, on average, over 2010 and 2011.  Based on re adings from futures markets, the staff 
expects oil prices to rise over the forecast period to about $86 a barrel at the end of 
2011, little changed from the October Greenbook. 
Against this backdrop, the staff expects real GDP to grow at an annual rate of just 
over 3 percent in the second  half of 2009, about 3½ percent in 2010, and about 4½ 
percent in 2011, very close to the October projection.  The unemployment rate is 
projected to be at its peak of around 10 pe rcent this quarter and early next year before 
declining slowly to about 9½ percent at the end of 2010 and 8¼ percent at the end of 
2011, similar to the trajectory in the last Greenbook, and well above the staff’s 5¼ 
percent estimate of the NAIRU.  In light of the current and prospective level of 
economic slack, the staff projects core PCE in flation to slow to around 1½ percent in 
the fourth quarter of this year and to ju st over 1 percent in 2010 and 2011.  Total 
PCE inflation remains slightly higher than core inflation. 
Looking further ahead, the staff assumes that the federal funds rate will rise 
steadily starting in the fourth quarter of 2011, climbing to about 3¾ percent in late 
2014.  The staff forecasts that real GDP wi ll expand at nearly a 4¾ percent pace in 
December 10, 2009
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)
25 of 72
 
   2012 and 2013 before decelerating in  2014.  Potential output is forecast to rise at an 
average pace of almost 3 percent per year from 2012 through 2014, and so with real 
GDP growth outstripping that of potential, the unemployment rate falls rapidly for a 
time, but then levels out in 2014 at just  under 4¾ percent, a bit below the staff’s 
estimate of the NAIRU in that year.  Longer-term inflation expectations remain 
stable, and, as the output gap nearly closes, total PCE inflation slowly rises to just under 1¾ percent by 2014, still somewhat below the central tendency of policymakers’ long-run projections for inflation.

6 Conditioning the four model-based estimates on information through the fourth quarter by 
starting the simulations in 2010Q1 would have the additional effect of moving the twelve-
quarter window further into the economic r ecovery, thereby boosting measured short-run MONETARY  POLICY STRATEGIES 
Chart 6 shows various estimates of short-run r*, defined as the real federal funds 
rate that, if maintained over time, would brin g output to its potential level at a horizon 
of twelve quarters.  Greenbook-consistent short-run r*, estimated using the FRB/US 
model, edged up 10 basis points from its October Bluebook value.  The estimate is 
now -1.9 percent, about 50 basis points belo w the actual real federal funds rate.  The 
Greenbook-consistent measure from the EDO model rose about 40 basis points, but 
at -3.3 percent remains well below the actual funds rate.  The increases in these 
measures largely reflect the modest upward revisions that the staff has made to its 
projection for GDP over the next two years.  
The other four measures of r* shown in the chart are based on models that 
condition on information only through last quarter.  Primarily as a result of the nearly 
1 percentage point downward revision to third-quarter real GDP growth since the 
October Bluebook, these models now genera lly indicate somewhat lower short-run 
values for r*.  In particular, the estimates of r* from the single-equation model and the 
small structural model are about 20 basis points lower than in October, and the

7  Even though the policy path is unconstrai ned in 2010Q1, it is conditioned on a federal 
funds rate in 2009Q4 that is at the effective lower bound rather than the lower value that 
was prescribed by the policy path in the October Bluebook.  With the interest rate 
smoothing embedded in the objective function, this initial condition influences the unconstrained optimal policy path for a time, leading to a somewhat higher level of the 
optimal funds rate through the middle of  2011 relative to the October path. Chart 7 shows the results of optimal control simulations of the FRB/US model.  
These simulations use the extended sta ff baseline projection—embodying liquidity 
and credit actions by the Federal Reserv e—as a starting point.  Policymakers are 
assumed to place equal weight  on keeping core PCE infl ation close to a 2 percent 
inflation goal, on keeping unemployment close to the NAIRU, and on minimizing 
changes in the federal funds rate.  As in  recent Bluebooks, optimal monetary policy 
under these simulations is constrained by the effective lower bound, and the nominal 
funds rate does not depart from this bound until the second half of 2012 (black solid 
lines).  Under this policy, the unemployment rate would be projected to remain well 
above the NAIRU, and core PCE inflation to stay appreciably below the 2 percent 
goal, until 2013.  
 Chart 7 also displays the optimal contro l results that are obtained if we assume 
that the nominal funds rate is not constr ained by the effective lower bound (blue 
dashed lines).  With the resulting more-acco mmodative stance of monetary policy, real 
activity exhibits a faster recovery, while th e trajectory for inflation is markedly closer 
to the assumed goal of 2 percent.  The unconstrained policy path has shifted up 
significantly since October.  This shift part ly reflects the staff’s assessment that the 
outlook for real activity has improved mo destly in recent weeks —an improvement 
mirrored in the upward revision to the Greenbook-consistent estimates of r*— as 
well as the earlier jumping-off point for adjusting the federal funds rate.7

8 While the staff projection roughly corresponds to the mode of the distribution, the 
financial-market forecast is probably closer to a mean.  Stochastic simulations of the 
FRB/US model suggest that the mean of the di stribution of the staff’s federal funds rate 
projection first rises above ¼ percent in the second half of 2010, in contrast to late 2011 in 
the staff’s modal baseline projection.  As depicted in Chart 8, the outcome-ba sed estimated policy rule prescribes a 
trajectory for the federal funds rate (upper- left panel) similar to the one in the 
previous Bluebook.  The funds rate starts rising above the effective lower bound in 
2011Q4, slightly earlier than in October.  According to stochastic simulations of the 
FRB/US model, the 90 percent confidence band for the funds rate in 2011Q4 spans 
an interval from the effective lower bound to about 2½ percent.8  Market participants’ 
expectations regarding the pa th of the funds rate have shifted noticeably lower over 
the intermeeting period (upper-right panel).  Staff models indicate, however, that term 
premiums may also have declined over th e period, suggesting that the drop in the 
expected trajectory of the federal funds rate could be smaller than that shown here.  Financial market quotes imply that the 90 pe rcent confidence interval for the federal 
funds rate in 2011Q4 spans a range from ab out ½ percent to about 4½ percent; the 
width of this interval is slightly smaller than in the previous Bluebook. 
The lower panel of Chart 8 provides near -term prescriptions from simple policy 
rules.  The two variants of the Ta
ylor rule , as well as the two es timated policy rules, 
leave the federal funds rate at its effectiv e lower bound over the next two quarters.  
When this bound is not imposed, all rules pr escribe funds rates that are higher (less 
negative) than in the previous Bluebook, reflecting the upward revision to the staff’s projection of the output gap.  The firs t-difference rule—because it responds to 
economic growth rather than to the estimat ed level of resource utilization—prescribes 
a slight upward trajectory for the policy rate , with the funds rate increasing to about 
65 basis points in 2010Q2.

POLICY ALTERNATIVES  
This Bluebook presents three policy alte rnatives—labeled A, B, and C—for the 
Committee’s consideration.  Table 1 provides an overview of the key elements of 
these alternatives.  Draft statements are pr ovided in subsequent  pages, followed by 
summaries of the cases for each alternative. 
The characterization of the economic ou tlook differs somewhat across the three 
alternatives.  Alternatives A and B note that  economic activity has continued to pick 
up, while Alternative C states that a recovery is under way.  All three acknowledge that the deterioration in labor markets is abating and that activity in the housing sector has 
increased.  Alternatives A and B, however, note that household spending continues to 
be constrained by a variety of factors.  Al ternatives B and C point to financial market 
conditions that have become more suppor tive of economic growth.  In contrast, 
Alternative A indicates that the recovery will be sluggish and slack in resource 
utilization will decline quite slowly absent further policy action.  As in the November 
statement, Alternatives A and B note that the Committee expects that inflation will 
remain subdued for some time because re source slack is likely to dampen cost 
pressures and because longer-term inflation expectations remain stable.  Alternative A 
mentions that inflation has fallen consider ably over the past year.  Alternative C 
indicates that the Committee expects inflation to remain stable, but in response to 
appropriate monetary policy adjustments ra ther than because of resource slack. 
Each of the three alternatives maintains th e target range for the federal funds rate 
at 0 to ¼ percent, but the alternatives di ffer in the specification of the size and 
completion dates of the Federal Reserve ’s purchase programs for agency MBS and 
agency debt, and also in their forward guidance regarding the path of the target federal

 funds rate.  Under Alternative A, the Co mmittee would increase its purchases of 
agency MBS to a total of $1.5 trillion (f rom the currently planned amount of $1.25 
trillion) and extend the timeframe for these purchases to the end of the second 
quarter of 2010.  The Committee also would complete its purchases of about $175 
billion of agency debt by the end of the first quarter of 2010.  The increase in 
purchases of MBS would provide additional macroeconomic stimulus, while the 
extension would permit the pace of transa ctions to be tapered to promote a smooth 
transition in markets as the purchases come  to an end.  Under Alternative B, the 
statement would be very similar to that for the November meeting.  The Committee 
would reiterate its intention to purchase $1.25 trillion of agency MBS and about $175 billion of agency debt and the plan to comple te these purchases by the end of the first 
quarter of 2010.  Alternatives A and B maintain the forward guidance from 
November that the Committee anticipates maint aining exceptionally low levels of the 
federal funds rate for an extended period, wi th this expectation explicitly conditioned 
on low rates of resource utilization, subdue d inflation trends, and stable inflation 
expectations.  Alternative A specifies that  the exceptionally low level of the federal 
funds rate anticipated is the curr ent 0 to ¼ percent target range. 
Under Alternative C, the amount of agen cy MBS purchases would be reduced to 
$1.1 trillion while agency debt purchases would be reduced to $160 billion.  The statement would also indicate that the Co mmittee anticipates that these purchases 
would be completed by the end of Januar y 2010.  Alternative C changes the forward 
guidance by indicating that the Committee anticipates “low” levels of the federal 
funds rate “for some time.” 
The alternatives also differ in their trea tment of the discussion of policy tools.  
Alternative A indicates that the Committee wi ll continue to employ a wide range of 
policy tools to promote economic recovery an d price stability.  Alternatives B and C

 November  FOMC  Statement  
Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in September suggests 
that economic activity has continued to pick up.  Conditions in financial markets were 
roughly unchanged, on balance, over the interm eeting period.  Activity in the housing sector 
has increased over recent months.  Househol d spending appears to be expanding but 
remains constrained by ongoing job losses, sl uggish income growth, lower housing wealth, 
and tight credit.  Businesses are still cutting back  on fixed investment an d staffing, though at 
a slower pace; they continue to make progress in bringing inventory stocks into better 
alignment with sales.  Although economic activity is likely to remain weak for a time, the Committee anticipates that policy actions to stabil ize financial markets and institutions, fiscal 
and monetary stimulus, and market forces w ill support a strengthening of economic growth 
and a gradual return to higher levels of resour ce utilization in a context of price stability.  
With substantial resource slack likely to continue  to dampen cost pressures and with longer-
term inflation expectations stable, the Committ ee expects that inflation will remain subdued 
for some time. 
In these circumstances, the Federal Reserve will continue to employ a wide range of tools to 
promote economic recovery and to preserve pr ice stability.  The Committee will maintain 
the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and continues to anticipate that 
economic conditions, including low rates of re source utilization, subdued inflation trends, 
and stable inflation expectations, are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal 
funds rate for an extended pe riod.  To provide support to mortgage lending and housing 
markets and to improve overall conditions in pr ivate credit markets, the Federal Reserve will 
purchase a total of $1.25 trillion of agency mo rtgage-backed securities and about $175 billion 
of agency debt.  The amount of agency debt  purchases, while somewhat less than the 
previously announced maximum of $200 billion,  is consistent with the recent path of 
purchases and reflects the limited availability of agency debt.  In order to promote a smooth 
transition in markets, the Co mmittee will gradually slow the pace of its purchases of both 
agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities and anticipates that these transactions will be executed by the end of the first quart er of 2010.  The Committee will continue to 
evaluate the timing and overall amounts of its purc hases of securities in light of the evolving 
economic outlook and conditions in  financial markets.  The Federal Reserve is monitoring 
the size and composition of its balance sheet and will make adjustments to its credit and liquidity programs as warranted.

1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in November suggests 
that economic
 activity has continued to pick up and that the deterioration in the labor 
market is abating .  The housing sector has shown some signs of improvement  over 
recent months, boosted in part by government incentives for first-time homebuyers .  
Household spending appears to be expanding but remains constrained by the weak labor 
market, modest  income growth, lower housing wealth, and tight credit.  Business 
spending is being dampened by firms’ e fforts to reduce inventories to bring them  
into better alignment with sales and by cutbacks in fixed investment .  Partly reflecting 
these factors, the Committee anticipates that  the economic recovery will be sluggish 
and that slack in resource utilization will diminish quite slowly absent further policy 
action.  
2.  Inflation has fallen consider ably over the past year.   With substantial resource slack 
likely to continue to dampen cost pressures  and with longer-term inflation expectations 
stable, the Committee expects that inflation will remain subdued for some time. 
3.  To promote a stronger economic recovery  and higher reso urce utilization, the 
Committee will provide additional monetary st imulus by increasing its purchases of 
agency mortgage-backed securities to a total of $1.5 trillion, up from the previously 
announced amount of $1.25 trillion; the Co mmittee anticipates th at these purchases 
will be executed by the end of the second qua rter of 2010.  The Committee is also in 
the process of purchasing  $175 billion of agency debt ; it anticipates that these purchases 
will be completed  by the end of the first quarter of 2010.  The Committee will continue to 
evaluate the timing and overall amounts of its purc hases of securities in light of the evolving 
economic outlook and conditions in financ ial markets.  The Committee will maintain the 
target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and continues to anticipate that low rates of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations are 
likely to warrant this exceptionally low range for  the federal funds rate for an extended 
period.  The Federal Reserve will continue to employ a wide range of tools to promote economic recovery and to preserve price stability.  The Federal Reserve is monitoring the size and composition of its balance sheet and w ill make adjustments to its credit and liquidity

 THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE  B 
If policymakers believe that completion of the Committee’s large-scale asset 
purchase programs as previously announced as well as the maintenance of 
exceptionally low levels of the funds rate for an extended period is a reasonable 
course of action given current economic circumstances, the Committee might adopt 
the policy actions and language of Alternative B.  Such a choice might be appealing if 
the Committee shares the staff’s assessment that incoming economic data and recent 
financial market developments are consistent  with sustained but moderate growth in 
output and subdued inflation over coming quarters.  In the staff forecast, output 
expands at a pace above trend over the forecast period, and the unemployment rate gradually declines.  Nevertheless, even by  the end of 2011, the unemployment rate 
remains above 8 percent, significantly higher  than the staff’s estimate of the NAIRU, 
suggesting that a very accommodative stance  of policy will remain appropriate for a 
considerable amount of time.  While the Greenbook-consistent measures of short-run 
r* have been revised up a bit since the No vember meeting, thes e measures are still 
negative and below the actual level of the re al federal funds rate.  Moreover, the funds 
rate path implied by the estimated outcome-based rule (Chart 8) seems consistent with the statement that economic conditions  are likely to warrant exceptionally low 
levels of the funds rate for an extended period. 
Even if participants believed that the economy might recover more quickly than 
in the staff forecast, they may nevertheless believe that they have considerable time 
before policy firming becomes appropriate.  For example, in the “Stronger Recovery” 
scenario in the Greenbook, inflation still re mains low over the fo recast period even 
though policy firming does not commence until the end of 2010.  Accordingly, 
policymakers may prefer to accumulate more  conclusive evidence that the economic 
recovery is firmly established before ti ghtening policy.  This preference may be

 reinforced by a view that some of the observed pickup in aggregate spending may 
reflect government policy actions whose influe nce is expected to wane in 2011.  More 
generally, participants may simply view the strength and sustainability of the recovery 
as still highly uncertain.   
While policymakers may view the current and projected slack in resource 
utilization, particularly the persistently hi gh unemployment rate, as unsatisfactory, an 
expansion of the LSAPs or other policy acti ons to provide more stimulus might be 
judged as likely to be relatively ineffectiv e and as entailing significant potential costs.  
Additional actions to stimulate the economy could boost inflation expectations, which 
may call for a reversal in the stance of policy before the r ecovery is sufficiently well 
established.  Moreover, a larger Federal Reserve balance sheet could also present 
challenges for the Committee’s exit strategy , either because the greater size could 
result in larger unrealized mark-to-market losses on the portfolio in the event of an abrupt upward movement in interest rate s or because of the potentially greater 
difficulty in controlling short-term interest rates that could result from even higher 
reserve balances. 
The Federal Reserve announced in June th at many of the liquidity facilities that 
have been supporting financia l markets would be extended until February 1, 2010.  
Because that date is approaching and fina ncial market functioning has improved to a 
great extent, policymakers may wish to c onfirm expectations that those liquidity 
facilities will in fact  be wound down early next year an d that the Federal Reserve is in 
the process of normalizing its support fo r markets.  The proposed statement in 
Alternative B provides language to describe that development. 
Market participants generally appear to  expect a statement along the lines of 
Alternative B, so the announcement of this action would likely elicit only modest

 reaction in financial markets.  To the extent  that some market participants may place 
some odds on a further extension of liquidity programs, the confirmation that these 
programs will likely be discontinued earl y in the new year could result in some 
pressures in money markets.  Moreover, th e announcement could be seen as another 
milestone in the normalization of monetary  policy implementation and—even with 
the language to the contrary in the statem ent—may be viewed as suggesting that the 
date at which policy firming would commen ce was drawing near.  On the other hand, 
market participants might view the statement as reassuring because it would reiterate the Committee’s and the Board’s assessment th at financial conditions have improved 
enough to allow the withdrawal of Federal Reserve support.   
THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE  C 
If policymakers viewed the inco ming data as indicating th at the recovery is gaining 
strength and that inflation pressures coul d begin to mount before long, they might 
wish to trim the size of the LSAPs and suggest in the policy statement that the 
Committee may need to raise the federal funds rate target in the not-too-distant future, as in Alternative C.  Under this  alternative, the Committee would reduce its 
total purchases of agency MBS and agency debt compared with the previously announced amounts and bring the LSAPs to  a more rapid close.  The statement 
would also suggest a somewhat earlier start to  policy firming by stating that the federal 
funds rate would remain at “low levels” for “some time” as opposed to the current 
characterization of “exceptionally low le vels” for “an extended period.”  The 
statement for Alternative C would use the s ame language as proposed for Alternative 
B regarding the likely expiration of  most of the liquidity facilities. 
Participants might be particularly attrac ted to Alternative C if they saw greater 
upside risks to inflation and inflation expe ctations than does the staff.  With a 
somewhat brighter labor market outlook, a falling foreign exchange value of the

 dollar, and readings on some measures of longer-term inflation expectations that are 
at the high end of their ranges over recent years, a significant further expansion of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet could be seen as risking a significant increase in 
inflation expectations that might prove costly  to reverse later.  The “Higher Inflation 
Expectations” scenario in the Greenbook presents such an outcome.  A change in the 
stance of monetary policy at this point in time could be vi ewed as appropriate in order 
to keep inflation expectations stable. 
Members’ inflation concerns could be  amplified if the recent spending, 
production, and labor market indicators we re seen as suggesting that aggregate 
demand going forward could be stronger than had been expected and that the softness in labor costs that had prevailed mi ght be coming to an end, along the lines 
of the “Stronger Recovery” scenario pres ented in the Greenbook.  Although bank 
lending continues to contract, large firms have ready access to capital markets, and 
broader financial market conditions became more supportive of growth, on balance, 
over the intermeeting period, with a lower foreign exchange value of the dollar, lower interest rates, and rising equity prices.  While business executives no doubt remain 
quite cautious, recent data on employment may  indicate that firms will become willing 
to hire and expand production sooner th an anecdotal information might suggest, 
pointing to a more rapid rise in  employment and investment than in the staff forecast.   
Members may also believe that measures of resource slack are subject to 
considerable error and, as a result, are not reliable guides for the conduct of monetary 
policy.  Consequently, they may  put less weight on the es timated level of output and 
unemployment gaps in forecasting inflat ion trends and more weight on inflation 
expectations and the change in output th an does the staff.  Misinterpreting the 
readings from the output gap could lead to  undesirable outcomes for inflation.  For 
this reason, participants may wish to signal  that they are prepared to raise the federal

 funds rate sooner than had been anticipate d, in addition to reducing the size of 
LSAPs. 
Finally, the Committee may be concerned that  even the present size of the Federal 
Reserve’s balance sheet could pose challenges  when it comes time to begin removing 
policy accommodation.  Some participants may believe that the current extremely 
high level of reserves could give significan t impetus to bank lending as banks become 
more confident about the outlook and their own capital positions.  A very sharp pickup in lending could be  unwelcome if it comes at  a time when the Committee 
wishes to remove policy accommodation.  The level of reserves  might also be of 
concern if participants are not confident that the tools at the Committee’s disposal will prove sufficient to allow it to rais e short-term rates when doing so becomes 
appropriate.  In either case, the Committee might choose to cap its purchases in order 
to limit the resulting risks.  As in Alternative B, the Committee may also view it as 
appropriate to affirm that the various li quidity facilities will be winding down.  
The adoption of Alternative C would greatl y surprise market participants and lead 
them to reevaluate, perhaps significantly, their beliefs regarding the Committee’s 
intentions.  The expected near-term path of  the federal funds rate could rise notably 
as investors inferred that a tightening in policy might be drawing near.  Longer-term 
rates presumably would also rise as the path for policy was shifted up, and equity 
prices might fall.  Importantly, MBS and primary mortgage rates could well move sharply higher; Federal Reserve MBS purc hases currently exceed the pace of new 
issues significantly, and the adoption of Alternative C would imply a dramatic scaling 
back of those purchases.  As a result, fu nctioning in the MBS market might become 
impaired for a time.  Forward measures of inflation compensation would probably 
decline if the Committee’s decision led inve stors to mark down their longer-term 
inflation expectations, and the exchange value of the dollar would likely rise.

 Given the strong reaction that curtailing the purchases of securities might 
provoke, the Committee might prefer to co nsider combining the forward guidance on 
the federal funds rate path in Alternativ e C with the LSAP purchases proposed in 
Alternative B.  By indicating that the Committee anticipated low interest rates for 
some time (instead of an extended period), such a combination would be less likely to 
generate disruptions in the functioning of  MBS and mortgage markets.  Nevertheless, 
the change in the forward guidance about the path of the federal funds rate would still 
prompt a strong revision to investors’ expe ctations, pushing up interest rates and 
likely causing equity prices to fall some what.  Another possible combination is to 
reduce the LSAPs as in Alternative C and maintain the forward guidance language 
from Alternative B.  Such a combination would have the possible advantage of exiting 
from unconventional policy earlier.  However,  this combination would also come as a 
considerable surprise to market participants and could well also disrupt MBS and 
mortgage markets to some degree and push up longer-term interest rates, although 
the rise in longer-term rates might be attenuated by the Committee’s continued 
expectation that economic conditions would warrant maintaining an exceptionally low 
rate for the federal funds rate for an extended period. 
THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE  A 
If the members’ views of the economic outl ook were similar to the staff forecast, 
with the unemployment rate remaining at very high levels for many quarters to come 
and inflation expected to fall further below a range consistent with price stability, then 
they might be inclined to put in place a dditional policy stimulus.  To do so, the 
Committee could increase the quantity of  agency MBS purchases and extend the 
timeframe for those purchases while continuing  to signal that the federal funds rate 
will remain at the effective zero lower bound for an extended period, as in Alternative 
A.  Even if they anticipate an outcome sim ilar to the staff forecast as most likely, 
December 10, 2009
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)

 participants may see a significant risk that  the economy could fall back into recession 
next year, perhaps after some of the suppo rt from government policies and liquidity 
facilities is removed.  Also, even withou t a relapse in the real economy, additional 
policy accommodation may be seen as appropr iate in view of the staff’s projection 
that, for many years, unemployment will remain very high and inflation below the 
majority of Committee participants’ long-run projections.   
The Committee may view some of the recent stronger readings on economic 
activity as reflecting temporary forces, such as fiscal policy, that may be overstating 
the underlying momentum of the ec onomy.  Moreover, the staff may be 
underestimating the restraint that weakness in the balance sheets of households and 
some firms will put on the expansion.  Indeed, the continued sharp contraction in bank credit and the sluggishness in M2 growth may point to slower economic 
expansion than is captured by the staff’ s forecast.  The “Weaker Aggregate Demand” 
scenario provided in the Greenbook illustrates these downside risks to the economy. 
The Committee’s previous decisions to maintain the size of LSAPs, rather than 
increase them, may have been based partly  on concerns about potential complications 
associated with the exit strategy.  Staff wo rk on the various tools to drain reserves may 
have provided greater confidence to pol icymakers that additional purchases of 
securities can be undertaken without signif icantly complicating the exit strategy.  In 
order to promote a smooth transition in fi nancial markets, given the greater quantity 
of purchases, the Committee may view it as de sirable to extend the time period over 
which the purchases are to be complete d to the end of the second quarter. 
An announcement such as that in Altern ative A would come as a surprise to 
market participants.  Most likely, short-te rm interest rates would fall as investors 
priced in a later liftoff of the federal fund s rate, and the resulting decline in mortgage

  and other longer-term rates would most likely be amplified by the increase in MBS 
purchases.  Equity prices might r
ise, whil e the foreign exchange value of the dollar 
would likely decline.  Infl ation compensation could increase to some degree if 
investors revised up their inflation expectat ions based on a larger size of the Federal 
Reserve’s balance sheet and greater policy accommodation.  Alternative A does not explicitly mention the expiration of the va rious liquidity facilities as do the other 
alternatives.  While this omission would in no way preclude policymakers from letting 
the facilities expire in February, participants  may prefer to explicitly signal that the 
Federal Reserve’s support for financial markets is winding down by including in 
Alternative A the paragraph proposed on the facilities’ expiration proposed for 
Alternatives B and C.

9 The Greenbook projection assumes that the federal funds rate begins to rise in the fourth quarter 
of 2011.  The balance sheet projections assume that the interest rate paid on excess balances 
becomes an effective floor for the federal funds ra te and that no draining of reserve balances is 
required to achieve the higher target federal funds rate. 
 LONG‐RUN PROJECTIONS  OF THE BALANCE  SHEET  AND MONETARY  BASE 
In this section, three scenarios for the balance sheet are presented that correspond 
to the different paths for large-scale asset purchases (LSAP) of agency debt securities 
and agency MBS proposed in the three polic y alternatives discussed in the “Policy 
Alternatives” section of the Bluebook.  The baseline scenario corresponds to 
Alternative B in which agency MBS purcha ses of $1.25 trillion and agency debt 
securities purchases of $175 billion are ex ecuted by the end of the first quarter of 
2010.  Under Alternative A, the agency MBS purchases are increased by $250 billion 
to a total $1.5 trillion and are completed by  the end of the second quarter of 2010; 
purchases of agency debt securities under this alternative remain at $175 billion and 
are executed by the end of the first quart er of 2010.  Under Alternative C, the 
quantities of agency MBS purchases and ag ency debt purchases are reduced to $1.1 
trillion and $160 billion, respectively; all purchases under this alternative are 
completed by January 2010. 
Projections for these scenarios are developed based on assumptions about each 
component of the balance sheet.9  Details of these assumptions are contained in 
Appendix C.  Substantive revisions to th ese assumptions, relative to the October 
Bluebook, are outlined below.  
In all three scenarios, total assets are lower over the majority of the projection 
period than in the October Bluebook, largel y due to a projected decrease in credit 
extended through the liquidity facilities that more than offsets an increase in the

10 The change in the path for prepayments larg ely reflects the incorporation of a more up-to-
date forecast from one of the MBS purchase program investment managers. 
11 The decrease in other deposits held at the Fe deral Reserve primarily reflects a decrease in 
deposits held at the Federal Reserve by Government Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs). forecasted level of agency MBS holdings.  The projected levels of credit extended 
through the primary credit program, Term  Auction Facility (TAF), and the Term 
Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF)  were revised down in response to lower 
use of these facilities over the intermeeting period.  Projections of these and other 
Federal Reserve liquidity programs and credit facilities implicitly incorporate a 
judgment about the potential interactions between their level and the level of reserve balances.  The upward revision to the leve l of agency MBS holdings reflects a lower 
assumed pace of prepayments.
10   
On the liability side of the balance sheet, the projected levels of reverse 
repurchase agreements with foreign official  and international accounts and of deposits 
held at the Federal Reserve other than by de pository institutions or the U.S. Treasury 
were revised down reflecting decreases over the intermeeting period.11  On net, the 
revisions in the asset and liability compone nts of the balance sheet imply an upward 
revision in the level of reserve ba lances over the projection period.

12 The composition of Federal Reserve assets in all three of these projections differs notably 
from historical patterns.  Prior to August 2007, U.S. Treasury securities were about 90 
percent of assets and the Federal Reserv e did not hold any agency mortgage-backed 
securities.  By contrast, under the baseline scen ario, Treasury securities are projected to 
account for only around 34 percent of total assets at the end of 2009 and rise to just 46 
percent of total assets at the end of the projection period.  The size and timing of the peak level of the balance sheet varies in each scenario, 
primarily because of the different path s for the LSAPs.  For the baseline and 
Alternative A scenarios, the balance sheet re aches a peak of $2.4 trillion and $2.5 
trillion, respectively, with the peak occu rring a quarter after the agency MBS LSAPs 
are assumed to be completed.  In Alternativ e C, the size of the balance sheet peaks at 
$2.2 trillion in December 2009.  By the en d of 2016, the size of the balance sheet 
under each scenario declines to roughly $1.5 trillion.12

  With respect to the level of reserve bala nces, the peak occurs at the end of 2009 
under the baseline and Alternative C scenar ios at $1.2 trillion and $1.1 trillion, 
respectively.  Although LSAPs continue into  2010 in each of these scenarios, reserve 
balances begin to decline at the beginning of  the year because of the decline in lending 
through liquidity and credit facilities and a return of the U.S. Treasury’s 
supplementary financing account to $200 bil lion following an assumed increase in the 
debt ceiling.  In contrast, under Alternative A, reserve balances do not peak until the 
third quarter of 2010 at $1 .3 trillion, reflecting the extension of asset purchases 
through the middle of next year.  Since the monetary base is derived from the balance sheet projections of Federal Reserve notes in circulation and reserve balances, the 
path of the monetary base in each scen ario largely mirrors the path of reserve 
balances.  Specifically, in ea ch scenario, the monetary base peaks at essentially the 
same time as reserve balances, and as rese rve balances decline, the monetary base 
contracts.  Towards the end of the project ion period, when reserve balances are 
assumed to stabilize at $25 billion, the growth rate of the monetary base roughly matches the growth rate of Federal Reserve notes in circulation.

 DEBT, BANK CREDIT , AND MONEY FORECASTS 
The staff projects that domestic nonfinancial sector debt will expand at an annual 
rate of about 1¾ percent in the fourth quarter of 2009 and then at about a 5½ 
percent pace, on average, over 2010 and 2011.  The forecast reflects rapid growth in 
federal government debt and a moderate increase in state and local government debt.  By contrast, increases in household and nonfin ancial business debt are projected to be 
sluggish.  Staff anticipates that household debt will not begin to expand noticeably until the second half of next year, and the pace of borrowing is expected to be 
subdued through 2011 because of roughly fl at home prices, a higher household saving 
rate, relatively tight lending standards, and loan charge-offs that remain elevated for 
some time.  The growth of nonfinancial busi ness debt is anticipated to be modest, as 
demand for external funds remains soft, banks’ terms and standards for business 
loans ease only gradually, and the commercial real estate market remains very weak. 
Commercial bank credit is expected to contra ct at an annual rate of 8½ percent in 
the fourth quarter, reflecting continued steep drops in loans—especially to 
businesses—and only a small increase in banks’ holdings of securities.  Bank credit is 
expected to increase about 1½ percent in 2010 as moderate growth in securities 
offsets a further decline in loans for much of  the year.  Loan growth resumes late in 
2010 as the economic recovery gains steam an d leads to a pickup in loan demand and 
a gradual easing of standards and terms, and in 2011 bank credit growth accelerates to 
about 5 percent.  C&I loans are projected to  continue to contract until late in 2010 
and to expand only sluggishly in 2011.  We ak fundamentals for commercial real estate 
and soft home prices hold down real estate loans through most of 2010, and that loan 
component is expected to expand only mode stly in 2011.  Consumer loans on banks’ 
books are expected to be about flat in 2010 be fore rising at a mode rate rate in 2011.

   M2 is projected to expand at an annual rate of only 2½ percent in the fourth 
quarter, as a reallocation of household wealth  toward higher-yielding assets continues 
to weigh on money demand to some degree.  Over the next two years, outflows from 
money market mutual funds and small time deposits are expected to diminish, while 
growth in liquid deposits is expected to  remain strong.  As a result, the staff 
anticipates that M2 will accelerate gradually over 2010 and will expand at a pace closer

DIRECTIVE   
 The November directive and draft lang uage for the December directive are 
provided below. 
NOVEMBER  FOMC MEETING 
The Federal Open Market Committee seek s monetary and financial conditions 
that will foster price stability and promote su stainable growth in output. To further its 
long-run objectives, the Committee seeks c onditions in reserve markets consistent 
with federal funds trading in a range from  0 to 1/4 percent. The Committee directs 
the Desk to purchase agency debt and agency MBS during the intermeeting period 
with the aim of providing support to private credit markets and economic activity. The timing and pace of these purchases shou ld depend on conditions in the markets 
for such securities and on a broader assessm ent of private credit market conditions. 
The Desk is expected to execute purchase s of about $175 billion in housing-related 
agency debt and about $1.25 trillion of agen cy MBS by the end of the first quarter of 
2010. The Desk is expected to gradually slow  the pace of these purchases as they near 
completion. The Committee anticipates that outr ight purchases of securities will cause 
the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet to expand sign ificantly in coming 
months. The System Open Market Account Manager and the Secretary will keep the 
Committee informed of ongoing developments  regarding the System's balance sheet 
that could affect the attainment over ti me of the Committee's objectives of maximum 
employment and price stability.

 Measure  Description  
Single-
equation 
Model The measure of the equilibrium real rate in the single-equation model is based on an 
estimated aggregate-demand relationship between the current value of the output gap and its lagged values as well as the lagged values of the real federal funds rate. 
Small 
Structural 
Model The small-scale model of the economy consists of equations for six variables: the output 
gap, the equity premium, the federal budget surplus, the trend growth rate of output, the real 
bond yield, and the real federal funds rate. 
EDO 
Model Estimates of the equilibrium real rate using EDO—an estimated dynamic-stochastic-
general-equilibrium (DSGE) model of th e U.S. economy—depend on data for major 
spending categories, price and wages, and the federal funds rate as well as the model’s structure and estimate of the output gap. 
FRB/US 
Model Estimates of the equilibrium real rate us ing FRB/US—the staff’s large-scale econometric 
model of the U.S. economy—depend on a very broad array of economic factors, some of 
which take the form of projected values of the model’s exogenous variables. 
Greenbook-
consistent Two measures are presented—based on the FRB/US and the EDO models.  Both models 
are matched to the extended Greenbook forecast .  Model simulations determine the value of 
the real federal funds rate that closes the output gap conditional on the extended baseline. 
TIPS-based 
Factor 
Model Yields on TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Secu rities) reflect investors’ expectations of 
the future path of real interest rates.  The TIPS-based measure of the equilibrium real rate is constructed using the seven-year-ahead instantaneous real forward rate derived from TIPS 
yields as of the Bluebook publication date.  This forward rate is adjusted to remove 
estimates of the term and liquidity premiums based on a three-factor arbitrage-free term-
structure model applied to TIPS yields, nominal yields, and inflation. APPENDIX A:  MEASURES OF THE EQUILIBRIUM  REAL RATE 
The equilibrium real rate is the real federal fund s rate that, if maintained, would be projected to 
return output to its potential level over time.  Th e short-run equilibrium rate is defined as the rate 
that would close the output gap in twelve quar ters given the corresponding model’s projection of 
the economy.  The medium-run concept is the value of the real federal funds rate projected to keep 
output at potential in seven years, under the assum ption that monetary policy acts to bring actual 
and potential output into line in the short run and then keeps them equal thereafter.  The TIPS-
based factor model measure provides an estimate of market expectations for the real federal funds 
rate seven years ahead.  
The actual real federal funds rate is constructed as the difference between the nominal rate and 
realized inflation, where the nominal rate is measured as the quarterly average of the observed federal funds rate, and realized inflation is given by the log difference between the core PCE price 
index and its lagged value four quarters earlier.  If the upcoming FOMC meeting falls early in the 
quarter, the lagged inflation measure ends in the la st quarter.  For the current quarter, the nominal 
rate is specified as the target federal funds rate on the Bluebook publication date.

 Estimates of the real federal funds rate depend on the proxies for expected inflation used.  The table 
below shows estimated real federal funds rates ba sed on lagged core PCE inflation, the definition 
used in the Equilibrium Real Federal Funds Rate ch art; lagged four-quarter headline PCE inflation; 
and projected four-quarter headline PCE inflation beginning with the next quarter.  For each 
estimate of the real rate, the table also provid es the Greenbook-consistent measure of the short-run 
equilibrium real rate and the average actual real federal funds rate over the next twelve quarters.

 APPENDIX B:  ANALYSIS  OF POLICY PATHS AND CONFIDENCE  INTERVALS 
RULE SPECIFICATIONS    
For the following rules,  it denotes the federal funds rate for quarter t, while the explanatory variables 
include the staff’s projection of trailing four-quarter core PCE inflation ( πt), inflation two and three 
quarters ahead ( πt+2|t and πt+3|t), the output gap in the current period and one quarter ahead (*
ttyy  
and *
1| 1|tt ttyy ), and the three-quarter-ahead forecast of annual average GDP growth relative to 
potential (44*
3| 3| tt ttyy  ), and * denotes an assumed value of pol icymakers’ long-run inflation 
objective.  The outcome-based and forecast-based ru les were es timated using
 real-time data over the 
sample 1988:1-2006:4; each specification was chosen  using the Bayesian information criterion. Each 
rule incorporates a 75 basis point shift in the intercept, specified as a se quence of 25 basis point 
increments during the first three quarters of 19 98.  The first two simple rules were proposed by 
Taylor (1993, 1999).  The prescriptions of the fi rst-difference rule do not depend on assumptions 
regarding r* or the level of the output gap; see Orphanides (2003). 
Outcome-based rule it =  1.20i t-1–0.39i t-2+0.19[1.17  + 1.73 πt  + 3.66(*

First-difference rule it = it-1 + 0.5(πt+3|t –*) + 0.5(44*
3| 3| tt ttyy    ) 
FRB/US  MODEL SIMULATIONS    
Prescriptions from the two empirical rules are computed using dynamic simulations of the FRB/US 
model, implemented as though the rule were followed starting at this FOMC meeting.  The dotted line labeled “Previous Bluebook” is based on the curre nt specification of the policy rule, applied to 
the previous Greenbook projection.  Confidence intervals  are based on stochastic simulations of the 
FRB/US model with shocks drawn from th e estimated residuals over 1969-2008.  
INFORMATION  FROM  FINANCIAL  MARKETS   
The expected funds rate path is based on Eurodollar quotes and implied three-month forward rates 
from swaps, and the confidence intervals for this path are constructed using prices of interest rate 
caps.  
NEAR‐TERM PRESCRIPTIONS  OF SIMPLE  POLICY  RULES   
These prescriptions are calculated using Greenbook projections for inflation and the output gap. 
Because the first-difference rule involves the lagged funds rate, the value labeled “Previous 
Bluebook” for the current quarter is computed using the actual value of the lagged funds rate, and 
the one-quarter-ahead prescriptions are based on th is rule’s prescription for the current quarter.

13 Prepayments include regular payments of principal and repayments of mortgages. APPENDIX C:  LONG‐RUN PROJECTIONS  OF THE  
BALANCE  SHEET AND MONETARY  BASE  
This appendix presents the assumptions underlying the projections provided in the section entitled 
“Long-Run Projections of the Bala nce Sheet and Monetary Base.” 
GENERAL ASSUMPTIONS  
The balance sheet projections ar e constructed on a monthly frequency from December 2009 to 
December 2016.  The few balance sheet items that  are not discussed below are assumed to be 
constant over the projection period at the leve l observed on November 30, 2009.  The projections 
for all major asset and liability categories are summarized in the charts and table that follow the 
bullet points.   
The Greenbook projection assumes that the federal funds rate begins to rise in the fourth quarter of 
2011.  The balance sheet projecti ons assume that the interest rate paid on excess balances becomes 
an effective floor for the federal funds rate and that no draining of reserve balances is required to achieve the higher target federal funds rate. 
ASSETS 
Asset Purchases  
 The baseline scenario incorporates large-scale asset purchases (LSAP) roughly in line with 
those that have been announced. 
o The Committee purchases $175 billion in agency debt securities and $1.25 trillion in 
agency MBS; both types of purchases are to be executed by the end of the first quarter of 2010. 
 Agency debt securities and agency MB S are held to maturity and are not 
replaced.  Prepayments of MBS are not reinvested. 
 Holdings of agency debt securities pe ak at $172 billion in March 2010, and 
decline slowly over the remainder of the forecast horizon as they mature.  The peak is slightly below the annou nced purchase amount, reflecting the 
maturity of agency debt securities al ready in the SOMA portfolio.    
 Due to expected settlement lags an d prepayments, agency MBS holdings 
peak at $1.1 trillion in June 2010, a somewhat lower level than the amount purchased.
13  For agency MBS, the rate of prepayment is based on estimates 
from one of the program’s investment  managers.  The historically low 
coupon on these securities implies a relatively slow prepayment rate.  As a result, at the end of 2016, $657 billi on of the $1.25 trillion of MBS purchased 
remain on the balance sheet.

 o The Committee’s purchases of $300 billion in U.S. Treasury securities related to the 
LSAP program were completed by the end of October 2009. 
 The maturity distribution of the Treasury securities purchased as a part of the 
LSAP program is based on data from  the Federal Reserve Bank of New 
York’s Markets Group.  The maturities  of most purchases are between two 
and ten years, with the weighted averag e maturity being a little over six years. 
 There are no sales of Treasury securiti es purchased as a part of the LSAP 
program, and maturing securities are not rolled over.  As a result, total 
holdings of Treasury securities decline as issues mature.  Treasury securities 
held in the SOMA portfolio prior to the initiation of the LSAP program are 
assumed to be reinvested as they mature.   
 In the scenario corresponding to Alternative A, the Committee increases its purchases of agency MBS by $250 billion to a total of $1.5 trillion and extends the timeframe for these purchases to the end of the second quarter of 2010.  The Committee completes its purchase of $175 billion in agency debt securities by the end of the first quarter of 2010. 
 In the scenario corresponding to Alternative  C, the Committee decreases its purchases of 
agency MBS by $150 billion to a total of $1.1 trillion and reduces its purchases of agency debt securities by $15 billion to a total of $160 billion.  The Committee completes these 
purchases by the end of January 2010. 
 A minimum level of $25 billion is set for rese rve balances.  By the end of the projection 
period in the baseline and Alternative C scenario s, the expansion of Federal Reserve notes in 
circulation and capital, combined with a runoff of assets, necessitates not only the reduction of the U.S. Treasury’s supplementary financing account to zero, but also the resumption of 
Treasury securities purchases to maintain rese rve balances at a level of $25 billion.   
Liquidity  Programs  and Credit Facilities 
 Projections of the liquidity programs and credit facilities implicitly incorporate a judgment 
about the potential interactions between their level and the level of reserve balances. 
 Primary credit declines gradually from its curre nt level to $1 billion by the end of 2011 and 
remains at that level thereafter.  Secondary cred it is assumed to be zero over the forecast 
period. 
 The Term Auction Facility (TAF) falls to zero by July 2010 and remains at zero thereafter.   
 The Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facili ty (TALF) peaks at $62 billion in March 2010.  
As these loans mature or are prepaid, credit extended through this facility reaches zero by the second quarter of 2015. 
o TALF loans are extended with either a three-year or a five-year term. 
 Until loans with a three-year term begin to mature in 2012, the decline in TALF is attributable to prepayments.   
 In 2012, TALF loans begin to decline mo re rapidly, reflecting the maturity of 
three-year loans.   
 After all three-year loans have matured in 2013, TALF declines at a less rapid pace as five-year loans mature, because the dollar amount of five-year loans is smaller than the dollar amount of three-year loans.

14 On March 2, 2009, the Federa l Reserve and Treasury jointly announced a re structuring of the government’s assistance 
to AIG.  As part of this restructuring, on December 1, 2009, the revolving cred it facility was reduced in exchange for 
preferred interests in two special purpose vehicles create d to hold common stock of two AIG subsidiaries.  The total 
size of the assistance to AIG is not directly affected by this restructuring.    o TALF loans backed by asset-backed securi ties other than newly issued commercial 
mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) reach $50 billion by March 2010.  A portion of 
these loans are expected to prepay, and the quantity outstanding reaches zero by the 
end of the first quarter of 2015. 
o TALF loans backed by newly issued CMBS  reach $12 billion by March 2010.  These 
loans are assumed to be held to maturity,  and the quantity outstanding reaches zero 
by the second quarter of 2015. 
 The Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF) and central bank liquidity swap lines are assumed to expire on February 1, 2010; funds extended through these facilities decline to zero in the second quarter of 2010 as their credit extensions mature. 
 No credit is extended through either the Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility (AMLF) or the Pr imary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF) before 
the facilities expire February 1, 2010. 
 Support to AIG, the sum of the Federal Reserv e Bank of New York’s extension of revolving 
credit and its preferred interests in AIA Aurora LLC and ALICO LLC, remains around $40 billion through midyear 2011 and then declines to zero by the end of 2013.
14   
 The assets held by Maiden Lane LLC, Maiden Lane II LLC, and Maiden Lane III LLC are sold over time and reach either zero or a nominal level by the end of 2016.   
 The assets held by TALF LLC increase to $2 billion by June 2012 and remain at that level 
through 2014.  Assets held by TALF LLC  comprise investments purchased with 
commitment fees collected by the LLC and from the U.S. Treasury’s initial funding.  The 
LLC does not purchase any ABS received by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in 
connection with a decision of a borro wer not to repay a TALF loan.  
Other  Assets 
 The Special Drawing Rights (SDR) certificate a ccount increases by $2 billion, to $7 billion, 
by the third quarter of 2011, as a result of an assumed monetization of the recent allocation 
of SDRs. 
LIABILITIES  AND  CAPITAL 
 All liabilities and capital assumptions are th e same across scenarios except where noted 
below. 
 Federal Reserve notes in circulation grow in line with the staff forecast for money stock 
currency through the end of 2011.  From 2011  to the end of the projection period, Federal 
Reserve notes in circulation grow at the same rate as nominal GDP, as projected in the extended Greenbook forecast. 
 Reverse repurchase agreements remain roughly at the current level of reverse repurchase agreements with foreign official and internationa l accounts.  Some minor fluctuations in the

15 The staff forecast for end-of-month U.S. Treasury’s operati ng cash balances includes forecasts of both the TGA and 
balances associated with the U.S. Treasury’s Tax and Loan program.  Because balances associated with the Tax and 
Loan program are $2 billion, for the time being, this fo recast is a good proxy for the level of TGA balances. near-term level of reverse repurchase agreemen ts reflect the tests by the Open Market Desk 
of triparty reverse repurchase agr eements with primary dealers.  

 The U.S. Treasury’s general account (TGA) follo ws the staff forecast for end-of-month U.S. 
Treasury’s operating cash balances through June 2010.15  Thereafter, the TGA drops back to 
its historical target level of $5 billion by the end of next year as it is assumed that the 
Treasury will have implemented a new cash management system that allows it to easily invest 
funds in excess of $5 billion.  The TGA remains constant at $5 billion over the remainder of the forecast period. 

 In the near term, movements in the U.S. Treasury’s supplementary financing account (SFA) reflect constraints the U.S. Treasury faces with regards to its debt limit.  In line with the Treasury’s announcement regarding the Supplemen tary Financing Program, the SFA has run 
down to $15 billion.  Subsequently, under th e assumption that the Congress raises the debt 
limit, the balances in the SFA gradually increase to $200 billion over the first quarter of 2010 and remain at this level in each of the scenarios until the SFA is reduced to ensure reserve balance levels do not fall below $25 billion.  The timing of when the SFA is reduced to maintain reserve balance levels of $25 billion varies across the three scenarios. 
 Federal Reserve capital grows 15 percent per year,  in line with the average rate of the past 
ten years. 
 In general, the level of assets of the Federal Reserve drives the level of reserve balances.  
Increases in the levels of other liability items,  such as Federal Reserve notes in circulation 
and the TGA, along with increases in the level of Reserve Bank capital drain reserve balances.  Reserve balances in the three scenar ios peak at different levels and at different 
times.  However, in all scenarios, reserve bala nces fall back to $25 billion by the end of the 
forecast horizon.
