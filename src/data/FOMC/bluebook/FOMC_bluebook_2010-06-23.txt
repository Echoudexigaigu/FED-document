Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook 
The information we have received on economic activity since the time of the 
April projection—information that largely pertai ns to a period too early to reflect the 
influence of the recent turmo il in Europe—suggests that the economic recovery has been 
proceeding at a moderate pace, about as we had anticipated.1  Businesses have been 
adding jobs and raising hours across a range of industries,  and manufacturing output has 
been registering solid and widespread gains.  Consumer spending continues to move 
higher, and business investment in equipment and software has been rising rapidly.  On 
the less-favorable side, commer cial construction continues to  decline, the underlying pace 
of economic activity in the housing sector remains anemic, and spending by state and 
local governments is still being weighed dow n by ongoing fiscal pressures.  On net, we 
are projecting that real GDP will rise at an  annual rate of 3½ percent in the current 
quarter after having risen at a 3 percent rate in the first quarter—rat es of growth just a 
touch faster than we projected in April. 
However, because of intensifying concerns  about the implications of the fiscal 
difficulties faced by some European countries, and the accompanying reaction in 
financial markets, some key factors influe ncing our forecast are now less expansionary 
than in our previous projection.  Most impor tantly, the appreciation of the dollar and the 
drop in equity prices imply noticeably less demand for domestic production.  These 
influences are only partially offset by the asso ciated drop in oil prices and the declines in 
some interest rates.  As a result, we now proj ect real GDP to increase at an annual rate of 
3 percent in the second half of this year and 3¾ percent in 2011, about ¾ percentage 
point slower during both periods than in the April forecast.  With this reduced pace of 
output growth, we project the unemployment rate to come down more slowly, only to 
9½ percent at the end of this year and to 8½ perc ent at the end of 2011. 
The additional economic slack in this pr ojection, as well as the stronger dollar and 
lower level of oil and other commodity prices , all work in the dire ction of lowering the 
inflation projection relative to the April fore cast.  However, with inflation expectations 
remaining well anchored, we have reduced our in flation forecast only slightly in response 
to these influences.  Thus, we now project that core PCE prices will rise about ¾ percent

  both this year and next, versus a projection of a bit below 1 percent in April.  Meanwhile, 
we expect oil prices to start to turn back up later this year  following their recent drop, and 
on net, energy prices are not e xpected to push headline inflation very far from core over 
the forecast period. 
KEY BACKGROUND FACTORS  
Monetary Policy 
We continue to assume that the FOMC w ill hold the target federal funds rate in 
the current range of 0 to ¼ percent through the end of next year.  Indeed, given the 
weaker economic outlook and lower inflation in  this projection, we have pushed back the 
date at which the FOMC begins  to raise the target for shor t-term interest rates until the 
summer of 2012, about one-half year later th an in the April forecast.  In terms of 
nontraditional policy actions, we now assume that the Federal Reserve will begin selling 
agency debt and MBS at a gradual pace at the beginning of 2013.  Thus, compared with 
the April forecast, the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet is projected to be somewhat 
smaller and more concentrated in holdings of  Treasury securities, w ith the most notable 
revisions occurring over the longer term.  This  change in nontraditional policy led us to 
make a small upward adjustment to the projecte d path of longer-term interest rates next 
year as market participants are assumed to an ticipate some of the effects of future sales.  
The 10-year Treasury yield has decreased about 45 ba sis points since the April 
projection was closed.  The decline likely refl ects both a flight to quality in response to 
the European situation and some downward re vision to market partic ipants’ expectations 
for short-term interest rates.  Going forward, we anticipate that the 10-year Treasury yield 
will increase about ¾ percentage point to  4¼ percent by the end of 2011.  While this 
projected path is noticeably lower than in the April forecast, it is also a bit steeper.  As 
before, the upward tilt reflects the gradual movement of the 10-year valuation window 
through the period of ne ar-zero short-term rates and th e expectation of further large 
increases in Treasury debt in coming years.   Moreover, as mentioned, the new balance 
sheet projections are expected to result in slightly more upward pressure on Treasury 
yields over the medium term. 
Financial Conditions 
In recent weeks, conforming 30-year mortgage rates have decreased to 
4¾ percent, well below our forecast in April.  We have lowered the path of mortgage

  rates over the projection peri od, but we expect them to ri se to about 5½ percent by the 
end of 2011.  By contrast, yields on BBB-rated corporate bonds have not changed much 
since mid-April, nor has our forecast for a slig ht increase through the end of next year.   
The Dow Jones Total U.S. Stock Market In dex is nearly 10 percent lower than we 
had expected in the April projection.  We estimate that the equity premium has moved 
even further above longer-run norms, and we ther efore project that stock prices will rise a 
bit faster than in the April forecast—at an  average annual rate of 17 percent—to help 
bring the equity premium toward a more typica l level.  Even with this steeper trajectory 
for stock prices, the market value of corporate equities averages about $2 trillion lower 
over the projection period than we assumed in April. 
The recent readings on house prices have b een about in line with our expectations 
that prices would soften th is spring.  We continue to assume that house prices, as 
measured by the LoanPerformance index, will re main relatively flat on balance, slipping 
2½ percent over the course of this year and edging up in 2011.  (See the box on house 
prices for further discu ssion of our projection.) 
Fiscal Policy 
Because recent congressional actions indi cate heightened concerns about the 
deficit and less appetite for additional stimulus measures, we have made two small 
changes to our fiscal policy assumptions.  We scaled back the package of additional 
grants-in-aid to state and local governments  from $35 billion to $25 billion, and we 
removed the $12 billion extension of health-insurance subsidies for recently unemployed individuals (COBRA) that we had assumed previously.  Our assumptions regarding other policies, such as the extension of emergenc y unemployment benefits, are the same as in 
the April forecast.  With these two changes, we estimate that federal fiscal policy will add about ¾ percentage point to real GDP grow th (on an annual-average basis) in 2010 and 
then will be essentially neutral for GDP growth in 2011.  These numbers show only a 
touch more restraint than in April. 
Our forecast for the unified budget deficit is roughly the same as in April, as the 
effect on revenues of the weaker GDP proj ection is largely offs et by small downward 
revisions to our path for expenditures.  Thus , the deficit still is expected to be about 
$1.4 trillion (9¼ percent of GD P) in fiscal 2010 and $1.3 trillion (8½ percent of GDP) in

Page 5 of 96Staff Forecast of Residential House Prices
House prices have declined somewhat in recent 
months, reversing some of the modest increases 
 that occurred in the spring of 2009.  These 
 declines have been widespread, with more than 
40 percent of metro areas reporting that prices in 
April were lower than a year earlier.  The recent 
weakness in house prices has been in line with 
our expectations. 
As can be seen in the lower left figure, we expect 
house prices to fall a bit further over the rest of the year, as the support to demand provided by 
improving economic conditions and housing 
market stimulus packages is outweighed by the 
effects of high unemployment, large inventories 
of foreclosed propertie s, tight credit, and 
expectations by prospective buyers of only modest capital gains over the longer run.  In all, we expect house prices to fall 2.6 percent during 
2010 before holding about flat during 2011 (see 
table).  These anticipated house price movements 
are small compared with the 30 percent drop seen 
from 2006:Q1 to 2009:Q1. 
An important factor affecting our outlook is 
whether housing is expensive or cheap relative to 
historical norms.  As a rough gauge of this 
relationship, we use the detrended ratio of prices to rents (see lower right fi gure).  As of the first 
quarter of 2010, prices were about in line with 
historical norms according to this measure, 
compared with an estimate of a greater than 
40 percent overvaluation in early 2006.  By this 
metric, house prices in our projection will be 
undervalued relative to rents by about 10 percent 
at the end of 2011, reflecting the factors 
mentioned previously that are weighing on house 
prices. 
Regarding foreclosures, we continue to expect 
that foreclosure mitigation efforts will have 
successfully prevented around 1 million 
foreclosures through the end of 2011.  In the 
absence of these programs, our forecast for the 
level of house prices at the end of the next year 
would be about 4 percent below our baseline 
projection.

  fiscal 2011.  The slight narrowing of the deficit next year reflects the budgetary effects of 
the economic recovery along with the winding do wn of some stimulus-related spending.   
The Foreign Outlook and the Dollar 
The incoming data on economic activity abro ad have generally surprised to the 
upside, prompting us to revise up our estimates of aggregate foreign economic growth for 
the first half of this year.  However, we are not carrying this st rength forward, as we 
anticipate that stresses in financial markets and associated negativ e confidence effects 
resulting from the troubles in Europe will wei gh on foreign activity.  In the euro area in 
particular, we have marked down domestic de mand substantially, although the effect of 
this markdown on euro-area GDP has been offset in part by an upward revision to net 
exports, which are boosted as a result of the weaker path of the euro.  We now have 
foreign growth stepping down from a 4½ percent pace in the first half of this year to a 
3¼ percent pace in the sec ond half and next year. 
The intensification of con cerns about Europe and the potential ramifications for 
the rest of the world prompted a widespread  retreat from risk that lifted the foreign 
exchange value of the dollar is against the euro and most other currencies.  Since the April forecast, the dollar is up about 3½ percen t on a trade-weighted basis against a broad 
set of currencies.  Our outlook is predicated on the working assumption that financial 
conditions in Europe and elsewhere will remain  strained through most of this year and 
will normalize only gradually starting early next y ear.  By then, we expect that vulnerable 
European countries will be making some progress implementi ng their fiscal consolidation 
plans and the financial stop-gap measures announced by European leaders will be put in 
place.  Given these assumptions, the dollar is now projected to remain around current 
levels through the end of this year.  We anticipate that, as more time passes without 
adverse market events, investors will beco me more comfortable taking on greater risk, 
and thus we project that the br oad real dollar will begin to give back some of its gains 
next year, depreciating at an a nnual rate of 6 percent.  This projection leaves the path for 
the dollar above that in the previous forecast by 4½ percent at the end of this year and by 
1½ percent at the end of next year. 
Oil and Other Commodity Prices 
Since the April forecast, oil prices have declined.  The spot price of West Texas 
Intermediate (WTI) crude oil closed on June 15 at about $77 per barrel, about 
$6.50 lower than at the time of the previous fore cast.  Prices of futures contracts dated for 
                                                 
2 The oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico is likely to have serious consequences for important industries (for 
example, fishing and tourism) in the affected localities.   However, on its current dimensions, the disaster 
does not appear likely to register sizab le effects at the national level.  
3 The hiring of 411,000 temporary workers in May for the decennial census brought the cumulative 
level of census hires to about 560,000—close to our previous assumption.  We expect the winding down of 
the census to subtract about 250,000 wo rkers from government payrolls in June, with the effect on the level 
of employment reaching essentially zero by September.

  delivery through the end of next year have de clined, on average, by a similar magnitude.  
In contrast, the far-dated futures price ha s moved down by less, settling at about $95 per 
barrel as of June 15 and down just $1.50 since the previous forecast.  Market commentary 
has largely attributed the recent decline in oi l prices to the sovereign debt problems in 
Europe and associated concerns  that the global recovery may lose some of its momentum.  
Consistent with futures prices, we now project  that the spot price of WTI will rise to 
nearly $83 per barrel by the end of 2011, about $7 lower than in the previous forecast. 
Likely for the same reasons that generated the fall in oil prices, prices for metals 
and agricultural raw materials, especially lu mber, have dropped sharply in recent weeks, 
leading us to revise down our forecast for nonfuel commodity prices in the third quarter.  
By contrast, food prices have registered only modest declines since the previous forecast.  
Consistent with quotes from futures market s, we project nonfuel commodity prices to 
increase at only a 2 percent pace, on averag e, for the remainder of the forecast period. 
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND THE NEAR-TERM OUTLOOK  
Much as we had expected in the April fo recast, economic activity appears to have 
continued to increase moderately and inflati on has remained low.  Real GDP rose at an 
annual rate of about 3 percent in the first qua rter, as final sales rose modestly and firms 
began to rebuild inventories.  In the current quarter, real GDP growth is projected to step 
up to a 3½ percent pace as final sales rise more sharply.2  The faster pace of growth this 
quarter reflects, in part, some factors that are likely to prove  transitory, mo st notably an 
expected rebound in federal defense spendi ng and a jump in residential investment 
associated with the expiration of the homebuyer tax credit.  
Labor Markets 
We have received both the April and May labor market reports since the time of 
the April forecast, and the news on labor de mand has been reasonably encouraging on the 
whole.  Although private nonfarm payroll employment rose only 41,000 in May, that 
disappointing reading followed sizab le increases in March and April.3  Moreover,

4 In reaction to the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, the Administration has announced a six-month 
moratorium on exploratory deepwater offshore drilling.   The reduction in drilling activity is expected to 
subtract 0.05 percentage point from the change in total IP in June, and we expect a similarly sized boost 
when the moratorium expires.  Looking ahead, moratorium-induced delays in bringing new wells online are 
expected to reduce crude oil production slightly in late 2010 and in 2011.

  employment gains in the priv ate sector have been increasingly widespread across 
industries over the past few months.  In addi tion, employers have continued to increase 
workweeks—particularly in manufacturi ng, where the workweek of production and 
nonsupervisory workers reached its highest level since July 2000, and where overtime 
hours per worker now stand at pre-recession levels.   
Relative to the April projection, the level of private employment in May was close 
to what we had expected.  However, we  did not anticipate th e expansion of the 
workweek, and thus aggregate hours appear on track to post a somewhat larger gain than 
we had projected.  In response to these de velopments, we have shifted some of our 
projected growth in total hours in the mont hs ahead from employment to the workweek 
on the expectation that the ongoing uncerta inty about the outlook will lead some 
employers to lengthen hours of their existing wo rkers rather than to hire new employees.  
Moreover, initial claims for unemployment insu rance are still elevated.  All told, we now 
expect private payrolls to rise 150,000 in J une, 75,000 less than in our April projection.   
The unemployment rate in both April and May was ¼ percentage point higher 
than we projected in the April forecast, stem ming in part from higher-than-expected labor 
force participation.  Given the downward revi sion we made to the projected pace of 
employment growth and the higher level of participation, we now expect the 
unemployment rate to hold at 9¾ percent in J une, the same as its fi rst-quarter average. 
The Industrial Sector 
Industrial production has continued to expand solidly, and we expect significant 
gains to continue in the near term.  With sizable increases in April and May, IP looks on 
track to rise at an annual ra te of 7½ percent in the second quarter—the fourth consecutive 
increase of about this si ze since its mid-2009 trough.4  In recent months, increases have 
been widespread across industr ies; indeed, the May readi ng of the diffusion index of 
three-month changes in IP reached its highest  level since 1987.  Th e available near-term 
production indicators, such as the diffusion i ndexes for new orders from the national ISM 
survey and the regional manufacturing surveys,  also point to furthe r gains for overall IP 
in the coming months.   
 
5 In order to qualify for the homebuyer tax credit, purchasers must have signed a sales agreement by 
the end of April and must close by the end of June.

  Household Spending 
                                                Growth in consumer spending appears to have moderated this quarter from the 
sizable gains posted earlier this year.  Real PCE was unchanged in April after having 
increased ½ percent in both February and March, and based on incoming data for retail 
sales and light motor vehicles, we project a gain of ¼ percent in May.  We expect real 
PCE to rise at an annual rate of a little less than 3 percen t this quarter following last 
quarter’s 3½ percen t rate of increase.  
The incoming information on various determinants of spending has been mixed.  
Disposable income has strengthened noticeabl y so far this year aided by the recovering 
labor market, and there have been indicati ons that credit conditions have become 
somewhat less restrictive in recent months.  However, the stock market has been falling, 
and consumer sentiment, though edging higher, still remains at rela tively low levels. 
Home sales in recent months surged in advance of the expiration of the scheduled 
homebuyer tax credit.  However, sales by la rge homebuilders fell back sharply in May, 
and the underlying pace of housing demand does not  appear to have firmed much since 
mid-2009. 5  And as for construction activity, si ngle-family starts trended up through 
April but fell off considerably in May; pe rmit issuance was low in May as well.  On 
balance, we still expect real residential investment to show a bounce in the current 
quarter, but we have scaled back our near -term assumptions for both starts and sales 
reflecting our view that the recent data have  indicated a stronger pull-forward from the 
tax credit than we had anticipated.  
Business Investment 
Real investment in equipment and software  (E&S) has continued to rise briskly.  
We expect real E&S spending to increase at an annual rate of 20 pe rcent this quarter, a 
little faster than the average pace seen over the previous two quarters.  Shipments of 
nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft rose at an aver age monthly rate of about 
1½ percent over the three months ending in Ap ril, with those increases broad based.  
Moreover, orders have outpaced shipments recently, suggesting that shipments will continue to move up in coming months.  In pa rticular, outlays for purchases of high-tech 
equipment appear to be rising rapidly th is quarter.  Finally, surveys of business

6 Offshore exploration represented only a small propor tion (3 percent) of total drilling rigs in operation 
prior to the moratorium on new deepwater energy exploration.  Thus, we expect the moratorium to have 
only a modest negative effect on drilling activity over the next six months—a reduction that is partially 
recovered over the remainder of the projection period after the moratorium expires.

  conditions and sentiment remained strong through May, and earnings forecasts for 
producers of capital goods have been upbeat.  
Meanwhile, there are hints that the dec line in business spending on nonresidential 
buildings may be ebbing.  Although spending on office and commerci al structures was 
still falling steeply through April, with the weakness likely related to high vacancy rates, 
falling property prices, and the light volume of  sales, outlays for new power plants and 
for manufacturing facilities have firmed in recent months.  In addition, forward-looking 
indicators such as the diffusion index for ar chitectural billings—w hich tends to lead 
spending growth by roughly two quarters—have improved to levels consistent with much 
smaller declines in spending than has occurred  in recent quarters.  In all, our projection 
now calls for only a small declin e in building construction this quarter.  At the same time, 
energy prices remain high enough to sustain so lid gains in real spending on drilling and 
mining, and data through early June show that  drilling activity has c ontinued to climb, on 
balance, in recent weeks.6
Incoming data indicate that firms have be gun to restock their i nventories.  Real 
nonfarm inventory investment turned positive in the first quarter, and data for April point 
to continued modest accumulations in the curr ent quarter.  None of this accumulation is 
expected to occur in the motor vehicles s ector, however, where pr oducers appear to be 
holding production steady despit e actual and expected increases in sales.  Excluding 
motor vehicles, we project that inventories wi ll increase at an annual rate of $28 billion in 
the second quarter, a bit more than as in the first quarter.  Consistent with a return to 
stockbuilding, both the Census book-value data  and the staff’s flow-of-goods system 
indicate that inventory-sales ratios for mo st industries appear to have moved into a 
comfortable range.  
Government 
In the government sector, we expect total real federal purchases to rise at an 
annual rate of 7 percent in the second quarter  after remaining about flat in the previous 
two quarters.  Information from releases of the Monthly Treasury Statement  through May 
suggests that defense spending is rebounding toward a level more consistent with 
appropriations; in addition, we estimate th at nondefense spending is being boosted by

  stimulus funds and by the surge in hiring for the decennial census.  Meanwhile, incoming 
data for state and local governments suggest th at real outlays will just edge lower this 
quarter after marked declines in the precedi ng two quarters, as the sector still faces 
considerable fiscal strains.  Employment in the state and local sector fell 11,000 per 
month, on average, in April and May, a slower  pace of job loss than the 20,000 per month 
declines reported for the first quarter.  And, after falling fairly steadily since mid-2009, state and local construction spending poste d small increases in March and April. 
Foreign Trade 
After subtracting almost 1 percentage point from real GDP growth in the first 
quarter, real net exports are expected to take ¼ percentage point off GDP growth in the 
second quarter.  We expect some moderation in the cyclical rebound of import and export 
growth this quarter, with imports expanding at about the same pace as exports but from a larger base.  We estimate that  real exports rose at an a nnual rate of 8¼ percent in the 
second quarter, driven by c ontinued robust GDP growth in foreign economies and the 
lagged effects of the dollar depreciation in 2009; this projection is a li ttle lower than in 
our April forecast, mainly reflecting weaker-t han-expected April trade data.  We estimate 
that real imports rose at an  annual rate of 8 percent in the second quarter, an upward 
revision from the April forecast.  Given th e downward revision to export growth and the 
upward revision to import growth, the projec ted contribution of net exports to GDP 
growth in the second quarter is  ¼ percentage point lower than  in our previous forecast. 
Prices and Wages 
Inflation has remained subdued.  Core PCE pr ices rose at an annual rate of about 
½ percent in the first quarter, and while we think that figure reflects a bit of transitory 
softness, our projection for the second quarter, at  a little less than 1 percent, remains quite 
low.  Indeed, core PCE prices posted anothe r small increase of 0.1 percent in April, in 
line with our expectations in the April project ion.  Core goods prices have been declining 
so far this year, with particularly large declin es in prices of apparel and of durable goods 
other than motor vehicles.  Core services pric es were also exceptionally soft in the first 
quarter, held down by declines in prices for housing services and by very low price 
increases for other market-based services ar ound the turn of the year ; in both cases, the 
data for April were a bit firmer.  
Headline PCE prices were unchanged in Ap ril as energy prices moved lower.  
Consumer energy prices are projected to fall further in May and June in response to the

  drop in crude oil prices since late April.  As  a result, on a quarterly  average basis, total 
PCE prices are now expected to edge down this quarter, whereas in April, we had 
expected them to increase at an annual rate of ¾ percent. 
The incoming data on labor compensation c ontinue to be quite weak.  Reflecting 
new estimates of wage and salary payments  from unemployment insurance tax records, 
the Productivity and Costs measure of compensation per hour now shows a decline of 
roughly 2 percent at an annual ra te in the fourth quarter of last year.  The increase in 
compensation per hour in the first quarter ha s also been revised down since the April 
projection, and this measure now appears to be increasing at only a 1 percent pace in the first half of this year.  By contrast, the ECI measure of hour ly compensation costs rose at 
an annual rate of 2½ percent in the first quarter, a bit more than we were expecting, reflecting outsized increases in health insurance costs and in empl oyer contributions to 
retirement and savings plans.  We do not expect  that jump in benefits costs to be repeated 
this quarter and thus expect th e change in the ECI to step do wn to about 1¾ percent.     
THE MEDIUM -TERM OUTLOOK  
Our forecast has the economy continuing to expand at a moderate pace, with real 
GDP growth projected to be 3 percent at an annual ra te in the second half of this year and 
3¾ percent in 2011.  This rate of growth is not iceably slower than we projected in April, 
reflecting the lower level of e quity prices and the stronger ex change value of the dollar.  
These forces are only partially offset by th e lower oil prices and the lower path of 
Treasury yields and mortgage interest rates.  Despite these downward revisions to real GDP growth, the basic story of our projecti on remains similar to that in previous 
forecasts.  The accommodative stance of mone tary policy, an attenuation of financial 
stress, the waning of adverse effects of earlier declines in wealth, and improving 
household and business confidence, all lead to a moderate recovery in economic activity 
over the projection period.  
The swing from sharp inventory drawdow ns in mid-2009 to modest stockbuilding 
in the first half of this year has contributed importantly to the upturn in real GDP thus far 
in the recovery.  And in the period ahead, we  expect some further modest impetus to 
production from a rising pace of inventory in vestment, as businesses attempt to keep 
stocks in line with the expansion of business sales.  But we expect the contribution to 
GDP growth from inventories to be consider ably smaller going forward than it has been

  over the past few quarters.  Rather, the expans ion in real GDP is projected to be more 
heavily dependent upon a further st rengthening of final demand.   
The financial repair process remains an im portant driver of the anticipated firming 
of demand; accompanied by accommodative moneta ry policy, this process supports the 
availability of credit and he lps set the stage for further improvements in household and 
business sentiment and spending.  Over the past year, a marked improvement in broad 
financial conditions is evident in higher equity  prices and lower interest rate spreads for 
corporate bonds and consumer loans.  Noneth eless, some sectors of the economy remain 
noticeably hampered by tight credit conditions.  This circumstance has been especially 
evident for bank-dependent borrowers such as  small businesses, and in the construction 
sector, where lending for development of nonresidential buildings and multifamily housing has been very tight; many builders of single-family homes have also reportedly 
faced difficulty in obtaining loans for land acquisition, development, and construction.  
The spillover of recent events in Europe to U.S. financial markets has presented a setback 
to the improvement in financial conditions th at we had anticipated, providing one reason 
why the rate of increase in real GDP in this projection, while still fast er than the rise in 
potential, is relatively tepid for an economic recovery.   
The housing sector also helps to explai n the relatively modest pace of overall 
economic recovery in our projection.  Lim ited credit availability to both homebuyers and 
builders, as discussed above, is  part of the reason for our expectation that the housing 
sector will improve only slowly from the recen t low levels of activity.  The substantial 
overhang of existing homes on the market, asso ciated with the high level of foreclosure 
activity, provides another reason for the slow  pace of improvement, as this overhang 
lessens the need for constr uction of new homes.  Neve rtheless, we look for housing 
demand to continue to firm gradually in response to favorable affordability, further 
confirmation that house pri ces are no longer declini ng appreciably, and the ongoing 
improvement in job prospects.   And, because the level of new home inventories is 
exceptionally low, and given the imperfect substitutability between new and existing 
homes stemming in part from location differe nces, stronger housing demand is likely to 
show through to new single-family construction to some extent.  In all, our forecast calls 
for single-family starts to step up from their recent pace of about 500,000 units at an 
annual rate to a pace of a little less than 900,000 units by the end of next year—a level of 
construction that is still very m odest by historical standards.

  Although the downward revisions to wealth  and income in this projection are 
expected to restrain the growth of consum er spending noticeably relative to the April 
forecast, we continue to expect that impr oving labor markets, increasing confidence in 
the durability of the recovery, greater access to credit, and a fading drag from earlier 
declines in household wealth  will support the growth of  consumer outlays over the 
forecast period.  Real PCE is projected to ri se at an annual rate of 2¼ percent in the 
second half of this year and to rise 3 per cent in 2011.  Given the downward revisions to 
wealth, the personal saving rate in this projection is almost ½ percentage point higher 
than we projected in April.  (The box on th e saving rate provides more detail about the 
rationale for our projection.)   
The outlook for business investment is also revised down in this projection, as the 
weaker pace of activity implies a reduced de mand for new capital.  Still, the overall 
outlook for business purchases of equipment and software remains favorable, supported 
by the replacement of aging capital, the re sumption of investment projects deferred 
during the financial crisis, and some expansi on of capacity along with rising sales.  The 
same cannot be said for investment in stru ctures, which, although expected to cease its 
sharp rate of decline, is projected to do no better than level off through next year.  The 
recovery of nonresidential c onstruction following a downturn te nds to lag the recoveries 
in other areas, likely because businesses requ ire a greater degree of confidence in the 
durability of recovery to commit to the purchas e of such large-scale, long-lived assets.  
Given the current weakness in demand fundame ntals and tight credit conditions for this 
sector, we do not expect a meaningful recovery for some time.  
The change in our assumptions for federal grants to state and local governments is 
small enough that it has only a slight effect on our projection for stat e and local spending.  
We now project these expenditu res to edge up ½ percent in 2011 after declining 1 percent 
this year.  Meanwhile, the rise  in real federal expenditures is expected to slow from 
3½ percent this year to 1½ percent in 2011, w ith a leveling off of defense purchases fully 
accounting for the slowdown.  
On average, net exports are expected to subtract ¼ percentage  point from real 
GDP growth in the second half of 2010 and in 2011, as imports increase at a slightly 
slower pace than exports but from a larger base.  The growth rates of both imports and 
exports are projected to m oderate from their robust recent pace as the cyclical 
bounceback in trade continues to fade.   Rela tive to the previous forecast, exports have 
                                                 
7 The 5¼ percent figure for the NAIRU does not include the effects of extended and emergency 
unemployment benefits (EEB).  EEB programs add to the unemployment rate by inducing individuals who 
would otherwise have dropped out of the labor force to report themselves as unemployed in order to receive these benefits, and by enabling jobseekers to be more deliberate in their search.  We estimate that these 
programs are currently boosting the unemployment rate by close to 1 percentage point, and we anticipate that this effect will only diminish a bit through next year.  As a re sult, the amount of unemployment not 
representative of slack in resource utilization—which could be thought of as an “effective” NAIRU—is currently around 6¼ percent and will edge down to about 5¾ percent by the end of next year.

  been revised down reflecting both the str onger dollar and the downward revision to 
foreign growth, whereas imports are little revised, as the influence of the stronger dollar 
and weaker U.S. activity are about offsetti ng.  Thus, our projected contribution of net 
exports to GDP growth in the medium term has been revised down, by about ¼ percentage point.  With this projection, th e current account deficit remains at about 
3¼ percent of GDP. 
AGGREGATE SUPPLY , THE LABOR MARKET , AND INFLATION  
Potential GDP and the NAIRU 
We have made no material change to our estimates of potential GDP in this 
projection.  We assume that potential GDP  will increase 2¼ percent this year and 
2½ percent in 2011, smaller than the 2¾ percen t gain in 2009.  Last  year, actual labor 
productivity rose 5½ percent, and we interp ret some of that imp ressive increase as 
reflecting one-time efficiency gains that firms were able to  achieve in a very difficult 
business environment.  We see such gains as persistent—and so have built them into the 
level of structural multifactor productivity—but  we do not believe them likely to be 
repeated going forward.  Partially offsetti ng the projected slowdown in structural 
multifactor productivity growth is our anticipa tion of a larger contribution from capital 
deepening:  We estimate that capital deepeni ng contributed little to structural productivity 
growth in 2009, reflecting the lagged effect of the contra ction in business investment 
since late 2007, but we expect  the contribution from capital d eepening to start to pick up 
this year and next as the projected rec overy in business investment strengthens. 
Also partially offsetting the projected slower pace of structural multifactor 
productivity growth is our assumption that the NAIRU will remain  at 5¼ percent through 
2011, rather than rising as we believe occurred during 2009.7  This assumption, in 
conjunction with anticipated population grow th and a small downward trend in labor 
force participation associated with the agi ng of the workforce, leads us to project

The Saving Rate in the Staff Projection 
 
 In our medium-term projection we expect the 
personal saving rate to edge up from 3½ percent 
 in the first quarter of this year to 4 percent by the 
 end of 2011.  Several factors contribute to this 
relatively flat contour fo r the personal saving rate. 
As shown in the figure below, the personal saving 
rate has been negatively correlated with the ratio 
of household wealth to disposable income over 
the past several decades.  Because wealth 
provides resources to fund household 
consumption, increases in wealth—holding 
income constant—tend to increase consumption 
and decrease the saving rate.  The recent financial 
crisis and recession have drastically reduced 
household wealth, pushing the wealth-income 
ratio down from a post– WW II peak in 2007 to a 
reading that is currently close to its post war 
average, a level that we expect to be maintained 
throughout the medium term.  All else being equal, the adjustment of household spending to  this lower wealth-income ratio would be consistent with a considerable rise in the saving 
rate from here forward.   
However, other important factors have also 
changed.  In particular, as shown in the bottom 
left figure on the following page, transfer income 
as a share of disposable income is now well 
above levels prevailing prior to the financial 
crisis, and the staff projects the transfer share to 
remain near this higher level throughout the 
medium term.  Because transfer income is often 
provided as a guaranteed annuity—such as 
Social Security benefits to retired or disabled 
persons—or is contingent on a household’s 
income being temporarily low—such as 
unemployment benefits—households are likely to consume a relatively high fraction of this type 
of income.  Indeed, historically, the ratio of

transfer income to total disposable income is 
negatively correlated with the saving rate after conditioning on the wealth-income ratio.  
Therefore, we expect the higher transfer share to 
restrain the rise in the saving rate over the medium term.   
Other factors are also likely to push down the 
saving rate over the projection period.  
Specifically, as the econom ic recovery proceeds, 
uncertainty about the economic outlook should diminish and reduce households’ desire to save 
for precautionary reasons.  Indeed, the 
stabilization in economic activity in the middle of 
last year led to a noticeable move up in consumer 
sentiment—shown in the figure in the bottom 
right—that coincided with a reduction in the saving rate.  As the recovery proceeds, we expect household confidence to increase further.  In 
addition, we expect co nsumer credit conditions 
to ease over the projection period, which should 
also put some downward pressure on household 
saving.   
Although there is considerable uncertainty about 
the magnitude of each of these influences on 
household saving, in our judgment the 
downward pull from larger transfer income, 
reduced precautionary saving and greater credit 
availability should largely offset the upward 
impetus from lower wealth.  As a result, the 
projected rise in the saving rate over the medium 
term is small and gradual.

  increases in trend hours of ¾ per cent this year and next, a litt le faster than last year’s 
growth.  
Productivity and the Labor Market 
As just noted, we interpret some of last year’s outsized rise in labor productivity 
as reflecting efficiency gains that will be pe rsistent even if not re peated.  But we also 
judge that firms have placed strains on worker s that will not prove sustainable.  Firms 
aggressively cut their staffing during the first half of last year and continued to reduce 
payrolls in the second half despit e a rise in real GDP of nearly  4 percent at an annual rate.  
As a result, we judge the level of productiv ity to have moved well above its structural 
level by the end of last year.  
As firms continue to become more confident about the durabili ty of the recovery, 
we anticipate that they will further expand hi ring to ease the strains on their existing 
workforces, holding productivity growth below its structural rate.  Indeed, we estimate 
that labor productivity rose at an  annual rate of about  1½ percent over the first half of this 
year—a little less than its stru ctural rate—and we project prod uctivity growth to slow to 
an average annual pace of less than 1 percent over the second half of this year and in 
2011.  Accordingly, we expect the pace of hours growth—and employment gains—to 
pick up in coming quarters.  However, given the weaker GDP path in this forecast, we 
now expect the pickup in job growth to come more slowly than in our April projection, 
with increases in private payroll employm ent projected to average about 200,000 per 
month over the remainder of this year and 275,000 per month in 2011.  This pace of job 
gains results in a gradual reduction in the unemployment rate from 9¾ percent in the 
second quarter to about 8½ percent by the e nd of next year; that end point is almost 
½ percentage point higher th an in the April projection.  
Resource Utilization 
The unemployment rate that we proj ect for the end of 2011 remains some 
2¾ percentage points above the level consis tent with the NAIRU adjusted for our 
estimate of the influence of extended and emergency unemployment benefits (EEB) on structural unemployment.  This considerab le degree of slack is expected to be 
accompanied by a number of other conditions cons istent with a still-weak labor market, 
including a below-trend level of labor force participati on and, in all likelihood, an 
unusually large concentration of workers experiencing unemployment spells of long 
duration.

  Our projection for the GDP gap also indi cates that the amount of slack in the 
economy is expected to diminish but re main substantial through 2011.  Given our 
downward revision for real GDP growth, we  project the GDP gap to shrink from 
7¼ percent at the end of 2009 to 5½ percent at the end of 2011; the gap at the end of next 
year is about 1 percentage point wider than in the April projection.  We expect slack in 
the industrial sector to be taken up more quick ly than in the economy as a whole, in part 
because manufacturing capacity is estimated to  have declined in 2009 and to fall further 
in 2010.  Even so, the factory operating rate at  the end of the projection period is about 
1¼ percentage points below its recent peak in the third quarter of 2007. 
Compensation and Prices 
We continue to project that  the wide margin of unused resources, along with the 
deceleration in price inflati on, will restrain labor costs over the medium term.  The 
Productivity and Cost measure of compensation per hour in the nonfarm business sector 
is projected to rise 1¾ percent this year and 2¼ percent next year; bo th figures are a little 
lower than in the April projection.  Similarly, we expect the employ ment cost index to 
rise at an annual rate of about 2 percent ove r the forecast period.  Th ese modest increases 
in hourly compensation, in conj unction with the moderate pr ojected increase in labor 
productivity, imply increases in unit labor costs of only about 1 percent, on average, this 
year and next.   
The higher path of the dollar in this projection, together with the downward 
revision to the path for non-oil commodity pr ices, has led us to re duce our projection for 
core goods import prices (that is , goods excluding fuels, computers, and semiconductors).  
We now expect core import pri ces to edge lower over the sec ond half of this year, down 
from a 2 percent projected rate of increase in  the April forecast.  We project that core 
import prices will increase a modest 1½ percent in 2011, as the dollar begins to 
depreciate and commodity prices remain flat.  In all, we now anticipate that import prices 
will be about a neutral influence on core PC E prices over the projection period, rather 
than a small positive influence as was the case in April.  
As noted earlier, the weaker paths of co re import prices and oil prices, and the 
increase in resource slack, all augment th e downward pressures on inflation in this 
forecast relative to those in the April projection; however, with inflation expectations 
anticipated to remain stable, we have made  only a small downward revision to our core 
inflation projection.  In particular, we project that core PCE prices will rise ¾ percent in

  both 2010 and 2011, just a touch below the Apri l projections.  The lower path of oil 
prices in this forecast has led us to revise down our projection for headline inflation this 
year by more than core, and we now look for headline inflation and core inflation to be 
about the same this year.  Next year, we projec t overall PCE prices to rise 1 percent, just 
a bit above core.   
THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK  
We have extended the staff forecast to  2014 using the FRB/US model and staff 
assessments of long-run suppl y-side conditions, fiscal policy, and other factors.  
The contour of the long-run outlook de pends on the following key assumptions: 
 Monetary policy aims to stabilize PCE inflation at 2 percent in the long run, 
consistent with the majority of longer-term inflation projections provided by 
FOMC participants at the April meeting. 
 Redemptions, prepayments, and sales of agency debt and MBS are assumed to 
significantly reduce holdings of longer-term securities in the Federal 
Reserve’s portfolio by the end of 2014.  Th is decrease in the Fed's holdings is 
assumed to contribute about 25 basis points to the rise in the 10-year Treasury 
yield from 2012 through 2014. 
 Risk premiums on corporate bonds and e quity, which have widened in this 
projection, decline gradually.  This assump tion is consistent with the view that 
the threat of systemic disruptions to global financial markets gradually abates.  Banks ease their lending standard s somewhat further beyond 2011.   
 Fiscal stimulus policies continue to boost the level of government spending 
through 2012.  The federal government budget deficit narrows to about 
5 percent of GDP by the end of 2014.  Th is improvement reflects the effects 
of the economic recovery on tax receipts  and transfer payments, as well as 
further policy actions after 2011 aimed at reducing the deficit. 
 From 2012 to 2014, the foreign exchange value of the dollar is assumed to 
depreciate 1¼ percent per year in real terms.  The price of  WTI crude oil rises 
gradually to nearly $90 per barrel by th e end of 2014, consistent with futures 
prices.  Under these assumptions, movements in the prices of energy and 
imports have only minor implications for domestic inflation in the extension.  
 
                                                 
8 In the long-run outlook, the federal funds rate (R) follows the prescriptions of a Taylor-type rule of 
the form R = 2.5 + π - 1.1(u-u*) + 0.5( π – 2), subject to the zero lower bound constraint.  In this 
expression, π denotes the four-quarter rate of core PCE inflation, u is the civilian unemployment rate, and 
u* is the staff estimate of the NAIRU (with an adju stment for the temporary effects on unemployment of 
the extended and emergency unemployment benefit progra ms).  In essence, this is just the traditional 
Taylor rule, rewritten in terms of the unemployment gap, with the coefficient on resource utilization 
appropriately rescaled.

  Foreign real GDP expands, on average,  about 3½ percent per year from 2012 
through 2014, with foreign output gaps continuing to narrow. 
 With emergency and extended unemployment benefit programs assumed to 
continue winding down over 2012, the “effective” NAIRU falls from 5¾ percent at the end of 2011 to 5¼ percent by the end of 2012 and then 
remains at that level through 2014.  Potential GDP is assumed to expand just 
above 2½ percent per year, on average, from 2012 to 2014.  
The unemployment rate enters 2012 at a ve ry high level, and inflation is well 
below the assumed long-run target.  Under the assumptions used to construct the 
extension, the federal funds rate remains at its effective lower bound through the middle 
of 2012.  From that point on, the federal funds  rate climbs steadily, reaching 2½ percent 
by the end of 2013 and 3½ percent in 2014.8  Real GDP continues to  increase faster than 
potential, decelerating gradually  after 2012 as pent-up demand is satisfied and interest 
rates rise.  The unemployment rate falls to the NAIRU by late 2014.  Core PCE inflation moves up modestly after 2011 as economic ac tivity recovers and long-run inflation 
expectations are assumed to remain well anchored.

International Economic Developments and Outlook 
Although incoming data on economic activity abroad have generally surprised on 
the upside, we expect the recent deepening of global financial stresses associated with the 
debt crisis in Europe to hold down activity in Europe and in much of the rest of the world 
as well.  Accordingly, we have marked down our forecast for growth abroad starting in 
the second half of this year.   
Growth in the first quarter turned out to  be significantly higher than we were 
anticipating at the time of the April forecast in Canada, Japan, Brazil, and a number of 
emerging Asian economies.  Although Mexi can GDP reportedly contracted, we are 
inclined to discount that outcome as othe r Mexican data were more upbeat.  Foreign 
indicators for the second quarter—such as  industrial productio n, retail sales, and 
exports—point to continued momentum for the global economy.  All told, we have 
marked up our estimate for aggregate foreign growth by ½ percentage point for the first 
half of this year, to 4½ percent.       
 Going forward, our outlook for activity abro ad is shaped by our sense of how the 
sovereign debt crisis in Europe is likely to evolve.  Obviously, the future trajectory of this 
crisis is clouded by considerable uncertain ty, but we believe the following working 
assumptions are plausible.  First, official support should prove sufficient for Greece to 
avoid restructuring of its sovereign debt  through 2011, although fis cal sustainability 
concerns will remain.  Second, some progress to ward fiscal consolidation will be made in 
Greece and other vulnerable European econom ies, although this progress may well fall 
short of announced plans.   Third, markets should increasingly di fferentiate countries

  such as Spain from Greece, thereby reducing the likelihood that heightened concerns 
about Greece will spill over onto its neighbors.   In addition, meaningful action taken to 
enhance confidence in European banks should allow markets, over time, to differentiate 
between stronger and weaker institutions, wh ich should increase the resiliency of the 
financial system.  Finally, we assume th at the European Central Bank (ECB) will 
maintain its stimulative stance.  
Given these assumptions, we expect that financial markets will remain agitated 
into the early part of next y ear, but tensions in these market s should then begin to recede 
as European countries make progress toward fiscal consolidation and strengthening their 
financial systems.  Even so, the extended peri od of financial strain is likely to lead to 
adverse effects on consumer and business conf idence and to tighter credit conditions, and 
these factors will weigh on foreign activity, both within and outside of Europe.  Accordingly, we expect that growth abroad  will move down to about 3¼ percent in the 
second half of this year and st ay at around that rate in 2011.   
This projection for global growth is ½ percentage point weaker over the forecast 
period than we anticipated in April.  We would have cut our foreign growth forecast further, were it not for the fact that the s ubstantial markdown to final domestic demand in 
the euro area is partly offset by a boost to net exports resulting from the much weaker 
euro.   By the same token, although many U.S. trading partners will be adversely affected 
by the markdown in U.S. activity, this is partia lly offset by the decline in their currencies 
against the dollar.  Finally, we continue to  see robust growth in the emerging market 
economies, which have the space for further mone tary and fiscal stim ulus, if necessary.  
Although in our outlook, Europe’s soverei gn debt problems lead to a material 
slowing of the global economic recovery, we  underscore that this baseline forecast 
assumes an eventual easing of financial stre sses.  Much worse outcomes are possible, as 
illustrated in the box in the Risks and Uncer tainty section titled “Consequences of a 
Severe European Sovereign Debt Crisis.”      
Consumer price inflation in  the foreign economies appears to have moderated to a 
greater extent in the second quarter than we were antic ipating at the time of the April 
forecast, partly reflecting the fall in oil and commodity prices.  Inflation abroad should 
remain subdued at about 2 percent over th e forecast period, given the presence of 
significant resource slack in a number of foreign economies.

  ADVANCED FOREIGN ECONOMIES  
We now estimate that real GDP in the advanced foreign economies (AFEs) grew 
3½ percent in the first quarte r, 1 percentage point higher than estimated in the last 
forecast, largely driven by upward surprises in Canadian private demand and Japanese 
exports.  Monthly indicators poi nt to still solid growth of  over 3 percent in the second 
quarter.  However, we project that growth will move down to 2¼ percent in the second 
half of this year and remain at that pace in 2011, as the fiscal cr isis in Europe and 
attendant global financial spi llovers weigh on these economies.   Core inflation rates in 
the AFEs are projected to remain subdued, as substantial economic sl ack persists over the 
forecast period.   
Euro Area 
   In spite of the ongoing stresses rela ted to Greece, indicators of euro-area 
economic activity have come in fairly strong in  recent months, and we estimate that real 
GDP growth in the second quarter picked up to  nearly 2 percent.  In April, industrial 
production expanded 0.8 percent, and German  manufacturing orders rose almost 
3 percent from the previous month.  Afte r reaching its highest level since August 2007, 
the composite PMI edged down in May but re mained solidly in the range indicating 
expansion.  Going forward, however, we expect that the financial stresses in Europe will finally show through to economic activity as consumer and business confidence decline, 
equity prices remain depressed, bank lending conditions tighten, and governments 
implement their fiscal consolidation plans.  (We expect fiscal policy to subtract about 
¼ percentage point from euro-area GDP growth in 2010 and a more substantial 
1¼ percentage points in 2011.)  In  consequence, real GDP growth  is projected to slow to 
Int’l Econ Devel & Outlook
Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR)
June 16, 2010
Page 38 of 96   
  only 1 percent in the second half of this year before edging up to 1¼ percent next year, as 
financial conditions begin to normalize and bus iness and consumer sentiment improves.   
All told, our projection for euro-area growth over the ne xt six quarters has been 
revised down ¾ percentage point since the April forecast.  The intensification of financial 
stresses since the April forecast led us to revi se down our forecast for the growth of final 
domestic demand 1 percentage point.  However,  because we are also penciling in higher 
net exports resulting from the recent depreciation of the euro, our forecast for total GDP 
growth is revised down less.   
We see the fiscal crisis as affecting different economies in the euro area to 
different degrees.  Our forecast for growth in Germany is down only ½ percentage point, as it greatly benefits from the weaker euro, but the peripheral countries will be hit hard as 
they attempt to slash their fiscal deficits in a fragile environment.  We do not anticipate a 
debt restructuring or other se verely adverse financial event in any peripheral euro-area 
economy during the forecast period, given the significant official support measures 
announced since the April forecast.  (S ee the box on “Recent Policy Announcements by 
European Authorities.”)         
Persistent resource slack in the euro area should continue  to restrain inflation, and 
we project headline consumer price inflation to  come in at 1 percen t this year and 1½ 
percent next year.  Core inflation is expected  to hold steady at rates below 1 percent until 
the end of 2011.  Amid weaker output growth  and subdued inflationary pressures, we 
expect the ECB to maintain easy monetary  and liquidity conditions and keep its 
benchmark policy rate unchanged at 1 percen t through the end of th e forecast period.   
United Kingdom 
After being held back in the first quarter by the January value-added tax hike, real 
GDP is set to expand 2 percent in the cu rrent quarter.  Although PMIs, business 
confidence, and manufacturing orders are consistent with more robust growth, measures 
of real spending and production have yet to confirm that the recovery has gained a solid footing.  Going forward, GDP growth should drift up, reaching 2½ percent by the end of 
the forecast period.  We project that fi nal domestic demand will strengthen, as 
households repair their balance sheets and fi nancial stresses ease.  Diminishing support 
from inventories and increasing drag from fiscal retrenchment will exert only a partial 
offset.

 Recent Policy Announcements by European Authorities 
In early May, European authorities announced a 
number of policy measures to contain the rapid 
intensification of market concerns about the 
fiscal sustainability of several euro-area 
countries.  To calm tens ions surrounding Greece, 
which had effectively lost access to market financing, the details of a €110 billion IMF and 
European Union (EU) assistance package were 
announced on May 2.  The package, which is contingent on the Greek government 
implementing drastic fiscal consolidation, 
provides full funding of government debt service 
for 18 months and the fiscal deficit for three 
years.  The package also  includes a €10 billion 
stabilization fund for the banking sector.  Under the plan, Greece is expected to reduce its 
headline deficit from almost 14 percent of GDP 
in 2009 to 2.6 percent in 2014.  At the same time, 
the ECB suspended the application of the 
minimum credit rating threshold on Greek 
government securities posted as collateral at its 
liquidity operations.   
Despite the announcement of the Greek package, 
investors’ concerns about European fiscal 
prospects continued to mount, and government 
bond spreads for Greece and other euro-area 
peripheral countries shot up further.   
In response, a broader set of stabilization 
measures were announce d on May 10.  The EU 
established a financial assistance program which provides up to €500 billion in funding, in 
addition to the funds already set aside for Greece.  If activated, funding would originate from two 
sources:  The European Commission (EC), which would provide up to €60 billion of lending by  
issuing debt guaranteed by all EU member states, and a special purpose vehicle, which 
would issue up to €440 billion in debt 
guaranteed by euro-area countries.  In addition, 
bilateral IMF programs could raise the total 
support to €750 billion.   
The ECB also announced further measures to 
improve liquidity conditions in impaired 
markets.  First, the ECB instituted a program to 
purchase European sovereign and private debt.  
So far, euro-area national central banks have 
purchased an estimated €47 billion of peripheral 
European sovereign debt over the past several 
weeks.  These debt purchases have been 
sterilized through variable-rate auctions of term 
deposits.  In addition, on May 12 the ECB 
conducted an unscheduled six-month operation 
at a rate indexed to its benchmark policy rate 
with full allotment.  The operation resulted in 
€36 billion being allotted, about twice market 
expectations.  Finally, the ECB reverted to a full 
allotment at a fixed-rate mechanism for its 
monthly long-term refinancing operations with 
three-month duration until the end of September.  
At the May 26 liquidity operation, the ECB 
allotted slightly more than €12 billion.  These 
euro liquidity measures were complemented by 
the temporary dollar swaps reinstated by the 
Federal Reserve with the ECB and several other 
major central banks.  (See the box in the 
Financial Developments section on “U.S. Dollar Funding Pressures and Dollar Liquidity Swap 
Lines.”)

  Relative to the April projection, our grow th forecast is down ½ percentage point 
over the forecast period.  This revision refl ects not only the lower confidence and tighter 
financial conditions spilling over from the sovereign debt crisis  in the euro area, but also 
faster fiscal consolidation than we assume d in the April forecast.  The coalition of 
Conservatives and Liberal Democrats, whic h recently gained control of the U.K. 
government, is moving quickly to ad opt ambitious fiscal targets. 
Headline 12-month inflation, at 3.4 percent in May, is expected to remain 
elevated this year, boosted by the hike in th e value-added tax and th e depreciation of the 
pound, before retreating rapidly to below the 2-pe rcent target in early 2011, as substantial 
slack in the economy becomes the predominant force on prices.  We have pushed back 
the Bank of England’s first policy rate hike to the middle of 2011 due to the weaker GDP 
outlook. 
Canada 
 We expect Canadian real GDP to grow  4 percent in the second quarter, a still-
solid rate of expansion but a step down from the blazing 6 percent pace recorded in the 
first quarter.  Indicators for the second qua rter remain quite strong, including robust job 
growth through May and ongoing expansion of real trade.  Beginning in  the third quarter, 
we expect the financial stresse s spilling over from Europe’s s overeign debt crisis and the 
associated substantial projected slowdown in U.S. GDP growth to weigh on the Canadian 
outlook, leading growth to decline further to 3¼ percent during the forecast period.  
Compared with our April forecast, this forecast is down slightly in the second half of this 
year and more substantially in 2011.    
In response to a closing output gap and w ith inflation squarely within its target 
band of 1 to 3 percent, the Bank of Canada (B OC) raised its target for the overnight rate 
to 50 basis points at its June meeting, a slightly earlier start to po licy tightening than we 
had anticipated.  We assume that the BOC w ill continue to raise rates 25 basis points per 
quarter over the forecast period.   
Japan 
Japanese real GDP continued to recover in the first quarter, rising at a robust 
5 percent pace, led by an ongoing surge in expor ts.  Export growth picked up further in 
April, and other indicators—including i ndustrial production, machinery orders, and 
consumer confidence—have continued to gradually improve.  As such, we project that 
 
Int’l Econ Devel & Outlook
Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR)
June 16, 2010
Page 41 of 96   
  real GDP will rise 3¾ percent in the second quart er, 2 percentage points faster than in the 
last forecast.  Going forward, we anticipate th at growth will decline to 1¾ percent for the 
remainder of the forecast period, as the fi scal impetus and the rebound in external 
demand begin to taper off, and as private domestic spending picks up only slowly.  This 
projection is only a bit slower than in the April forecast, as demand from emerging Asia 
continues to support exports.   
Notwithstanding the faster-than-expected recovery, considerable resource slack 
remains, and core prices (excluding food and energy) declined a record 1.7 percent in 
April from their year-earlier le vel, although part of the downt ick reflected a one-off cut in 
public school fees.  With the output gap con tinuing to narrow going forward, we project 
headline deflation to moderate to 1 percent in  the second half of 2010 and to ¾ percent in 
2011.  A new Bank of Japan facility will offe r one-year funds at the target for the 
overnight call rate, currently 10 basis points.  Th is facility is anticipated to have a very 
small impact on the Japanese economy since it s size is very limited (0.6 percent of GDP), 
and Japanese banks already have low-co st funding options available to them.  
EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES  
First-quarter GDP data for many emerging market economies (EMEs) surprised 
on the upside.  However, real GDP contracted  in Mexico and, give n its high weight, led 
to a markdown in aggregate growth in the EM Es, albeit to a still- solid 6½ percent.  
Incoming data point to only a small moderati on of growth in the second quarter.   We 
expect EME growth to fall to 4½ percent in the second half of this y ear and stay at that 
pace next year, as the double-digit rates re corded in several economies step down to 
more-sustainable rates.  This projection is about ½ percentage point  lower than in the 
April forecast, reflecting the tightening of financial market conditions and the markdown 
in U.S. and European growth.   
After climbing to 4½ percent at an annual ra te in the first quarter, consumer price 
inflation in the EMEs is estimated to have d eclined to 3 percent in the current quarter, in 
large part because of an unwinding of the effects of increases in food prices, administered 
prices, and taxes.  Consumer prices so far in the second quarter have generally surprised 
on the downside, and, going forward, our proj ection for EME inflation at 3 percent is 
slightly lower compared with the April forecast.

China 
In China, economic activity remained robus t in the second quarter.  China’s 
recovery has been broad based, with indus trial production, fixe d asset investment, 
exports, and domestic demand all posting sizab le gains.   In addition, with imports 
growing faster than exports, the trade surplu s narrowed significantly in the first quarter, 
but an especially strong export reading in Ma y points to a wider trade surplus in the 
current quarter.    
We expect Chinese real GDP growth to average around 9 percent through the 
remainder of the forecast period, down from  the double-digit pace of the past four 
quarters, as fiscal stimulus wanes and moneta ry tightening continues,  in part to address 
rising property prices.  We have marked dow n Chinese growth only a touch, as Chinese 
authorities have the scope to  reintroduce stimulus measur es should activity slow more 
than is consistent with their objectives. 
Chinese authorities raised banks’ rese rve requirement 50 basis points in May, 
bringing the cumulative increase for the year to  150 basis points.  Concerns about global 
growth stemming from the European fiscal crisis may restrain the extent of policy 
tightening going forward.  We continue to a ssume that the Chinese authorities will allow 
the renminbi to start appreciating against the U.S. dollar later this year.  However, the 
unsettled global outlook, along with the recent appreciation of the renminbi on a trade-
weighted basis as it has followed the dolla r upward, have led us to scale back the 
projected pace of renminbi appreciati on against the dolla r this year.   
Inflation pressures in China appear to be waning as food prices have retreated, 
although there was an uptick in monthly inflat ion in May.  Recent labor unrest at some

  factories in China, including a strike at Honda Motor Company, has resulted in some 
large wage increases, which poses a risk of more widespread increases and heightened 
inflationary pressures.   
Other Emerging Asia 
Real GDP in the emerging Asia region outside of China has grown at a double-
digit rate on average over the past year on th e back of Chinese growth, which has boosted 
the region’s exports, and policy stimulus.  Th is has pushed the level of GDP well above 
its pre-crisis peak.  Real GDP in emer ging Asia excluding China rose more than 
14 percent in the first quarter,  in part reflecting a nearly 40 percent rise (annual rate) in 
Singapore’s notoriously volatile  output.  A further hike in Singapore’s industrial 
production in April points to strong second-qua rter GDP as well, but we project a big 
payback in the third quarter.   In Sout h Korea, a reduced boost from government 
spending and inventories should push second-quarter growth down to a more sustainable 
4½ percent pace, from 8¾ percent in the first quarter, but consumer and business confidence has remained firm in the face of heightened tensions with North Korea.  
Indian growth is also expected to taper off,  to a still-robust 8 percen t pace in the current 
quarter, while growth in the ASEAN-4 region shou ld dip to about 3 percent, in part as the 
recent political turmoil in Thailand likely weighed on activity.   
All told, smoothing through th e third-quarter payback in Singapore, we project 
growth in emerging Asia excluding China to settle to a more-sustainable pace of 4½ percent in the fourth quarter and through ne xt year, as the crisis -related fiscal and 
monetary stimulus measures ar e withdrawn.  Nevertheless, the turmoil in Europe and 
greater uncertainty about the pace of global recovery may prompt policymakers in the 
region to delay their exits from stimulus.   
Latin America 
We project that real GDP in Latin America grew just ½ percent in the first quarter 
but bounced back to 5 percent in the second quarter.  The anemic growth in the first 
quarter is driven largely by a reported 1½ per cent contraction of real GDP in Mexico.  
However, we put little stock in that decline, as  it is inconsistent with monthly indicators:  
The Mexican activity indicator (a monthly pr oxy for GDP) rose 2 pe rcent in the first 
quarter at an annual rate; and recently Mexi can industrial production, exports, and retail 
sales have all been showing strength.  Brazili an GDP, which has a much lower weight in

Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR)

Page 44 of 96   
  our aggregate for Latin America, soared 11½ percent in the first quarter, although waning 
fiscal stimulus appears to be  restraining growth there in the current quarter.      
We expect that growth in Latin Ameri ca will slow over the second half of this 
year, largely reflecting a deceleration in activ ity in Mexico and Brazil, and come in at 
about 3½ percent next year.  Mexico’s step-dow n in growth is in line with the moderation 
in the expansion of U.S. manufacturing output .  A significant degree of resource slack in 
Mexico is likely to be unwound only slowl y, pushing inflation down to 3¾ percent by 
2011, within the Bank of Mexico’s (BOM) 2 to 4 percent target range.  Accordingly, we 
do not expect the BOM to start raising its policy rate until next year.  In Brazil, by 
contrast, the projected slowing of economic growth refl ects the unwinding of fiscal 
stimulus measures and a cumulative rise in th e policy rate since Apr il of 150 basis points.  
The passing of some special fact ors boosting prices earlier this year is expected to allow 
Brazilian inflation to decline to 4¼ percent in 2011, but with the economy continuing to 
overheat, we expect further monetary ti ghtening over the forecast period.

Over the intermeeting period,  investor demand for risky assets declined  in response 
to the evolving European fiscal crisis and concerns about the outlook for the global 
recovery.  In d omestic market s, investors  significantly tempere d their expectations for 
policy tightening, while broad equity price  indexes fell  about 6 percent, implied 
volatilities spiked, and corporate bond spreads widened  notably.  T he demand for safer 
securities contributed to a fall in nominal Treasury yields of as much as 35  basis points 
and a 2¾ pe rcent increase in  the broad trade -weighted foreign exchange value of the 
dollar.  Investors also priced in lower compensation for future inflation over the period.  
In most advanced foreign economies, benchmark sovereign yields declined substantially, 
and headline equity indexes dropped, with  bank shares in the euro ar ea losing almost  10 
percent  of their value.  In response to the reemergence of strains in U.S. dollar funding 
markets, the Federal Reserve and several  foreign central banks reestablished  dollar 
liquidity swap arrangements in early May . 
Overall borrowing by nonfinancial businesses was well maintained over the period, 
despite a slowdown  in speculative-grade bond issuance in May.  Indicators of credit 
quality in the business sector remained strong, and analysts’ revisions to corporate 
earnings forecasts were  positive this quarter.   In contrast, conditions in the commercial 
real estate market stayed  bleak.  In the household sector, mortgage debt fell further in the 
first quarter, and measures of refinancing activity remained subdued despite historically low mortgage interest rates.  Consumer credit was about unchanged in April, and 
measures of consumer delinquencies edged down further.  
Bank credit continued to decline in April and May, although the contraction in C&I 
and residential real estate loans slowed somewhat.   Bank profitability improved in the 
first quarter, boosted by higher net interest margins and a reduction in loan loss 
provisions .  M2 increased  moderately, on balance, over April and May, as sizable net 
declines in small time deposits and retail money market mutual funds were more than offset by strong net gains in liquid deposits.  
POLICY EXPECTATIONS AND TREASURY YIELDS

Financial Developmentsthe federal funds rate and the wording of the accompanying statement were largely in line 
with expectations and garnered  little market re action .  Upon the release of the minutes of 
the meeting , investors reportedly took note that a majority of participants favored asset 
sales at some point, although the release did not result in any notable change in market 
interest rates.   Economic data releases were mixed on balance over the intermeeting 
period, but market participants were especially attentive to incoming information  on the 
labor market—most notably, the private payroll figures in  the employment report for 
May, which were  considerably  weaker than investors had expected .  These data, 
combined with heightened concerns about the global economic outlook stemming from  
the European sovereign debt crisis, contributed to a downward revision in the expected 
path of policy.   
 Indeed, combined w ith the staff’s usual  assumption regarding term  premiums, 
futures quotes indicate that investors pushed back their expectation for  the first increase 
in the federal funds rate target to the first quarter of 2011 and scaled down the  expected  
subsequent pace of policy firming .  Quotes on interest rate caps suggest that investors’ 
perceived modal path of the federal funds rate also moved lower over the intermeeting 
period and that they now see late 2011 as the most likely time for the com mencement of 
tightening.  Results from the June survey of primary dealers also suggest  that market 
participants lowered their expectations for the path of the federal funds rate; respondents 
reported an average probability of just 14 percent that the first policy tightening would 
occur sometime this year, compared with  41 percent in the April survey.   
In the market for Treasury coupon securities, 2- and 10- year nominal yields fell 19 
and 33 basis points, respectively , over the intermeeting period.  M arket participants 
point ed to flight- to-quality flows as a factor boosting Treasury demand, and the drop in 
Treasury yields was accompanied by a widening of swap spreads and signs of increased 
demand for Treasury collateral in the repo market .  Implied volatility of longer- term 
Treasury yields  climbed to its highest level  in several months.  
TIPS- based inflation compensation decreased  about 25 basis points at the five -year 
horizon, pushed down by low readings for inflation  and falling  oil prices , while five -year 
inflation compensation five years ahead fell about 15 basis points.  Survey measures of 
both short- and long- term inflation expectations have changed little since April.

Financial DevelopmentsASSET MARKET DEVELOPMENTS  
Broad U.S. stock price indexes fell about 6 percent , on net, over the intermeeting 
period, reflecting t he deepening of concerns about the European fiscal crisis and the 
potential for adverse spillovers  to global economic growth.  Option- implied volatility on 
the S&P 500 index, as measured by the VIX,  spiked in mid -May to more than double its 
value at the time of the April FOMC meeting , reaching levels last recorded in early 2009; 
implied stock  market volatility fell back somewhat toward the end of the intermeeting 
period.  T he spread between the staff’s estimate of  the expected real return on equities 
over the next 10 years and an estimate of the expected real return on a 10 -year Treasury 
note—a measure of the equity risk premium—jumped  about 1½ percentage points from 
its already elevated level .  Equity mutual funds experienced sizable net outflows in May , 
contributing to the first monthly net redemption of long-term mutual funds since March 
2009. 
Investors’ attitude s toward financial institutions deteriorate d somewhat more than for 
the broader market this intermeeting period, with bank equity indexes f alling  10 percent 
and bank CDS spreads widen ing a bit more than those on investment-grade nonfinancial 
firms .  Allegations of past malfeasance at some large former investment banks and the 
resulting perception of higher legal risk continued to weigh on market sentiment.  M arket 
participants also remained  attuned to the potential effects of financial regulatory reform , 
and both S&P and Moody’s issued statements indicating that they would take more time 
than had been antic ipated  to analyze the implications of the pending legislation for the 
ratings of financial institutions.   
Yields on BBB-rated corporate bonds rose slightly over the intermeeting period , and 
yields on speculative-grade corporate bonds climbed  about 80 basis points amid 
substantial net outflows from high-yield bond mutual funds .  Given the declines in  yields 
on comparable- maturity Treasury securities, spreads on both speculative -grade and 
investment-grade corporate bonds widened significantly , although they remained within 
the range p revailing  since last summer .  Secondary- market b id prices on syndicated 
leveraged loans fell about 2 percentage points, while bid -asked spreads in that market 
climbed .

1 The effective federal funds rate averaged 20 basis points over the intermeeting period, with the 
intraday standard deviation averaging 4 basis points.  Trading volumes were about unchanged since the last 
intermeeting period.  
2 Gross fails to deliver in the agency MBS market moved to r ecord levels in recent weeks.  The fails 
were concentrated in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac 5.5 percent coupons and apparently reflected the lack of 
new issuance in that market and the relatively low cost of failing to deliver.  Nonetheless, traders report th at 
liquidity and market depth have not otherwise deteriorated of late.  Conditions in short -term f unding markets  deteriorated somewh at, particularly for 
European borrowers.  Spreads of term Libor over rates on overnight index swaps (OIS) 
widened notably, with trading volumes in maturities longer than one week reportedly quite thin.  Market participants also reduced holdings of commerci al paper sponsored by 
entities thought to have exposures to peripheral European financial institutions and 
governments.  (S ee the box on U.S. dollar funding pressures.)  Even so, s preads of high-
grade unsecured financial commercial paper to nonfinancial commercial paper  widened 
only about 5 basis points, on net, over the intermeeting period.  Thus far, quarter-end 
pressures in domestic bank funding markets appear to have been  relatively muted.
1
In
 secured funding markets, spreads on asset -backed commercial paper also widened 
modestly, while rates on repurchase agreements (repos) involving Treasury and agency 
collateral were  little changed.2  In the inaugural Senior Credit Officer Opinion Survey, 
which was conducted by the Federal Reserve at the end of May, dealers generally 
reported that the terms  at which they provided credit remained tight relative to 2006, 
although they noted some loosening of terms, on net, over the previous three months  for 
certain classes of clients —including hedge funds, institutional investors, and nonfinancial 
corporations—and intensified pressures by those clients to negotiate more-favorable terms.   At the same time, they reported a pick -up in demand for financing across several 
collateral types .  Over the intermeeting period, h aircuts and bid -asked spreads in the repo 
market  reported by primary dealers to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York held 
steady .   
HOUSEHOLD FINANCE

Financial Developmentsagency MBS widened somewhat relative to  Treasury securities.  Despite the low level of 
mortgage rates, r efinancin g volume has been relatively light because many homeowners 
refinanced when rates reached similar lows in 2009, while others may be unable to 
refinance due to  low credit scores or insufficient home equity.  Home mortgage debt 
declined at  an annual rate of about 4 percent  in the first quarter, as the volume of 
originations is estimated to have remained low and as elevated charge -offs pushed down 
existing loan balances ; the available data point to some additional decline in the current 
quarter.   Delinquency rates for prime, subprime, and FHA-backed mortgages edged down 
in March and April, although some of the decline likely reflected  seasonal patterns.   
House price indexes have changed little of late.   
The contraction in consumer credit is estimated to have mo derated in the first 
quarter, as an upturn in non revolving credit offset much of the continued steep decline in revolving credit.  Issuance of consumer credit ABS increased in May —though the level 
was still  well below that observed before the onset of the financial crisis —and spreads 
have ticked up in recent weeks.  Credit card ABS issuance remains subdued , as 
regulatory changes have made financing credit card receivables via securitization less desirable.  In primary markets, s preads o f credit  card interest rates over those on Treasur y 
securities remained extremely high in April, while  interest- rate spreads on auto loans 
remained near their average level over the past decade.  Consumer credit quality continued to improve, with delinquency rates on credit c ards and auto loans moving 
down a bit further in  April.   
BUSINESS FINANCE  
Overall, net debt financing by nonfinancial corporations has continued to expand in 
the second quarter.  Gross bond issuance by investment- grade nonfinancial corporations 
in the U.S. remained  solid, on average, in April and May, and nonfinancial commercial 
paper increased as well  over the two months .  High -yield  corporate bond issuance in the 
U.S. briefly paused in May  amid the market’s  pullback from risky assets, although 
speculativ e-grade U.S. firms continued to sell bonds abroad and a few placed issues 
domestically in the first half of June.  Meanwhile, the contraction in C&I loans 
outstanding slowed significantly in May from the pace registered over the past year and a 
half, with some indications that loan originations have begun to pick up.

U.S. Dollar Funding Pressures and Dollar Liquidity Swap Lines 
In March, dollar funding pressures reemerged in 
the euro area as ongoing uncertainties about the 
condition of euro-area financial institutions were 
amplified by concerns about their exposure to 
Greece and other peripheral euro-area economies. 
On net over the intermeeting period, U.S. dollar 
Libor has increased notably, with one-month and 
three-month tenors (see top left figure on the next 
page) up about 10 basis points and 20 basis 
points, respectively.  Moreover, anecdotal 
evidence suggests that trading activity is low 
beyond the one-week tenor and tiering has 
intensified in the bank funding market.  In 
particular, euro-area banks typically report 
paying higher rates than non-European banks, 
and peripheral euro-are a banks report paying 
higher rates than major core euro-area banks. 
That said, over the past couple of weeks, some measures of dollar funding conditions seem to 
have stabilized. 
Some euro-area financial institutions cannot 
readily access unsecured dollar funding in the 
wholesale market even in normal times and 
instead borrow euros and swap them into dollars 
via the private FX swap market.  The implied 
cost of dollar funding (see top right figure), under 
the assumption that euros are borrowed at euro 
Libor and swapped into dollars, has risen more 
than U.S. dollar Libor-based costs, with rates 
paid for one-month and three-month funds up 
30 basis points and 35 basis points, respectively.   
Data on commercial paper outstanding in the 
United States and on international capital flows 
provide further evidence of U.S. dollar funding 
pressures for euro-area institutions.  Since 
April 26, U.S. commercial paper outstanding issued by euro-area financial institutions fell $56 billion (see bottom left figure), while 
outstandings for ot her 
issuers were little  
changed.  The Treasury International Capital (TIC) data show that, in  March and April, U.S. 
branches of European banks increased their net lending to affiliates.  The most common 
explanation banks gave for this increase was that 
their affiliates faced U.S. dollar funding 
pressures.   
In response to the reemergence of these dollar 
funding strains, the FOMC reestablished dollar 
liquidity swap lines on May 9 and 10 with the 
European Central Bank (ECB), Bank of 
England, Bank of Canada, Bank of Japan, and 
Swiss National Bank.  So far, drawings on the 
lines have been limited, with only the ECB and 
the Bank of Japan attracting any bidders in their dollar tender operations.  The ECB’s first one-
week tender drew $9.2 billion in bids from seven 
participants (see bottom right figure); its most 
recent one-week auctions  drew no bids.  Only 
the ECB and the Bank of Japan have offered 
three-month dollar funding.  The ECB's first  
offering at this term drew only $1 billion in bids 
from six participants; the Bank of Japan’s 
offering elicited only $210 million in bids.  
Demand has been limited because the central 
banks are offering dollar liquidity in their 
markets at rates equal to the overnight index 
swap (OIS) rate plus 100 basis points—rates that 
have exceeded the cost of dollar funding 
available to most institutions through alternative 
sources.  However, these facilities were designed 
to provide a backstop, an d as such, even with 
very limited demand, they seem to be helping to forestall the severe dollar hoarding that drove 
funding costs so high in the previous crisis.

Financial DevelopmentsGross equity issuance fell  a bit , on net, in April and May, likely owing in part to 
recent equity price declines and market volatility.  Through the first quarter, equity 
retirements due to cash -financed M&A deals and share repurchases remained strong, 
leaving net equity issuance negative.  Announcements of both repurchases and M&A deals continued apace in April and May. 
Measures of the credit quality of nonfinancial firms have generally shown continued 
improvement.  Based on preliminary data, t he ratio of aggregate liquid assets to total 
assets for nonfinancial corporations remained in  record -high territory in the first quarter, 
and the aggregate debt -to-asset ratio declined a bit further.  Al though the expected default 
rate for nonfinancial firms from Moody’s KMV stayed  at a somewhat elevated  level, the 
dollar value of Moody’s upgrades of nonfinancial corporate bonds significantly outpaced 
that of downgrades during April and May, and t he six -month trailing default rate for 
bonds issued by nonfinancial firms fell further in May  to only a bit above zero.  F irst-
quarter profits for firms in the S&P 500 appear to have jumped about 20 percent at a quarterly rate.  This fourth consecutive quarter of solid earnings gains primarily reflected  
an upturn in financial sector profits from quite depressed  levels.   Revisions to year -ahead 
expected earnings jumped in mid -May to a record -high reading for the 30- year history of 
the series.   However, analysts generally have yet to react to recent weeks’ developments, 
such as the potential effects of dollar appreciation on earnings of domestic firms with 
substantial overseas sales.  
The overall picture in commercial real  estate markets remain ed grim .  Prices of 
comme rcial properties fell a bit further in the first quarter,  and the volume of commercial 
property sales has remained light in recent months.  The delinquency rate for securitized 
commercial mortg ages continued to climb in May, and indexes of commercial mortgage 
CDS prices declined, on net, over the intermeeting period.  With charge- offs mounting 
and new lending stalled, outstanding commercial mortgage debt decreased at an annual 
rate of 4½ percent in the first quarter.  
GOVERNMENT FINANCE  
During the intermeeting period, t he Treasury auctioned  about $335 billion of 
nominal coupon securities across the maturity spectrum.  As it had previously announced, 
the Treasury has reduced the sizes of its coupon auctions a bit in recent weeks, reflecting

Financial Developmentssome easing of its borrowing needs.  This period’s auctions were well received, with bid-
to-cover ratios generally above historical averages . 
The municipal bond market also remained receptive to issuers over the intermeeting 
period, despite continued concerns about the financial health of state and local governments.  In the first quarter, downgrades of municipal bonds outpaced upgrades, but 
gross issuance of long -term municipal bonds remained solid  in recent months , helped by 
continued strength in issuance for capital projec ts under the Build America Bond 
program.  Yields on long-term municipal bonds fell less than those on comparable-maturity Treasury securities, leaving their yield ratios significantly higher over the 
period.  Although some of this increase reflects the eff ect of investors’ safe -haven 
demand for Treasur y securities , the ratio of municipal bond yields to yields on 
comparable- maturity AAA -rated corporate bonds also moved noticeably higher. 
FOREIGN  DEVELOPMENTS  
The threat to global growth and European financial stability posed by the fiscal crisis 
in Greece and by the potential for similar troubles in some other European countries has sparked widespread flight -to-quality flows.  Concerns that Chinese policy tightening to 
damp  property speculation might derail Ch ina’s economic growth may also have 
contributed to the retreat from risky assets.  This retreat led to a broad appreciation of the dollar and declines in both equities and yields on benchmark sovereign bonds.  Investor sentiment has improved over the past week, leading to a partial reversal in these 
movements, despite Moody’s downgrade of Greece to junk status in mid-June.  On net, 
the dollar has appreciated more than 7 percent against the euro since April 27 and has 
risen 3  percent against sterling.  Of note, the dollar has increased 1 percent or more 
against the currencies of Canada, Australia, Brazil, and Malaysia even as the strong pace 
of growth in these economies led their central banks to tighten monetary policy.    
Headline equity indexes are down 4 to 12 percent in advanced foreign economies 
over the period and are also lower in most emerging market economies.  Consistent with 
flight- to-quality flows, emerging market equity inflows turned negative over the period.  
Bank shares in the euro  area have been particularly hard hit by the ongoing fiscal crisis 
and the reemergence of pressures on bank funding.  The strains in euro money markets led the ECB to reinstitute a six -month lending operation and switch its three-month

Financial Developmentslending operations from a fixed-quantity auction to a full- allotment offering at a fixed 
rate of 1 percent.  Strains also appeared in corporate debt markets as both nonfinancial 
and financial corporate debt issuance dropped substantially in the second quarter.  In addition, pressures in dollar funding markets reappeared for foreign financial institutions, 
especially those thought to have significant exposure to Greece and other peripheral euro-area countries.  To help contain these pressures and to prevent their spread to other institutio ns and regions, the Federal Reserve reestablished dollar liquidity swap 
arrangements with the ECB, the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan, the Bank of 
Canada, and the Swiss National Bank.   
Benchmark sovereign yields in the major advanced foreign economies, with the 
exception of Japan, have declined 20 to 45 basis points  on net.  The decreases were due 
in part to investors shift ing out of risky assets and into the safety of sovereign securities 
in the major economies.  In addition, concerns that Europe’s fi scal problems were 
clouding the outlook for global growth may have prompted sovereign yields to move 
lower.  Consistent with a flight into safe assets, f oreign private net purchases of U.S. 
Treasury securities remained elevated in April, the latest month f or which data are 
available, after increasing substantially in the first quarter of this year relative to the 
average rate recorded in 2009.  
Sovereign yields of peripheral European countries declined noticeably following the 
May 10 announcement of the EU framework for providing financial aid to euro- area 
governments and of the ECB’s intention to purchase euro-area sovereign debt.  However, 
yields remained high even after these announcements and have moved up since, 
notwithstanding the ECB’s purchases of government debt, which have total ed €47 billion  
so far .  In fact , spreads on 10- year Spanish sovereign debt are now higher than their May 
peak , reflecting Fitch’s one -notch downgrade of Spain’s credit rating  to AA+ and the 
country’s continuing problems with regional savings banks.   
Some si gns of strain have also been evident in emerging Europe.  Hungarian 
officials’ warnings that the previous government may have underestimated the extent of 
the country’s fiscal problems prompted a sharp selloff of the forint.  Market participants 
have come to believe that those comments exaggerated the difficulties for domestic 
political purposes, but substantial uncertainty remains.  Amid a weakening outlook for

Page 62 of 963 On January 21, 2010, Federal bank regulatory agencies announced that banks would be allowed to 
phase in the effects of FAS 166/167 on risk -weighted assets.  Fifty percent of affected assets must be 
included in risk-weighted assets at the end of the second quarter of this year and the remainder at the end of growth in the region, central banks in several emerging European economies—Russia, 
the Czech Rep ublic, Romania, and Hungary—have begun to decrease policy rates.   
Foreign official purchases of U.S. Treasury securities remained strong through April.  
More-timely data on custody holdings at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York show a decline in foreign  official holdings of U.S. Treasury securities in May, only partly offset 
by higher holdings of agency securities.  Official inflows from emerging market countries likely slowed, as emerging markets have had to purchase fewer dollars to resist their 
curren cies’ appreciation now that the dollar has been strengthening. 
COMMERCIAL BANKING  AND MONEY  
Bank credit fell in April and May at about the same pace as in the first quarter on 
average, and it has now declined for 15 consecutive months.  The contraction in core 
loans ( C&I, real estate, and consumer loans) continued to be the primary cause of the 
decline, on balance , but the runoff of core loans slowed somewhat relative to the past 
several quarters.  C&I loans, after falling at a 17 percent annual rate in Apr il, decreased at 
only an 8 percent pace in May, the smallest drop in 18 months.  While commercial real estate and home equity loans fell at a slightly faster rate than in recent quarters, the contraction in closed -end residential loans abated , part ly because of  a reduced pace of 
sales to the GSEs.  Consumer loans declined again, on average, in April and May.  Sales 
of Treasury securities at several large domestic banks and foreign -related institutions 
contributed to a sizable drop in banks’ securities holdings in May. 
According to the first-quarter Call Reports, bank profitability improved moderately, 
although it  remained  at the low end of its historical range.  The better earnings stemmed  
primarily  from  an increase in banks’ net interest margin s and a fairly widespread decline 
in loan loss provision s.  The consolidation of previously securitized loans under FAS 
166/167 contributed to some of the improvement in measured net interest margins, but 
the accounting rule changes also generated a decline in noninter est income from 
securitizations and an increase in  loan  loss provisioning at the affected banks.

weighted assets in advance of the implementation of FAS 166/167 because they had provided material 
support to the securitization structures.  Banks were not allowed to phase in the effects of FAS 166/167 on 
average tangible assets in calculating their leverage ratios.  adjusting for the effects of the accounting rule changes, outstanding loan balances fell 
further in the first quarter at b oth weak banks—those with CAM ELS ratings of 3, 4, or 
5—and strong banks—those with CAMELS ratings of 1 or 2.  In addition, unused 
commitments to fund loans declined again in the first quarter.  Meanwhile, a reduction in 
risk-weighted assets and capital infusions from parent holding companies further boosted 
risk-based capital ratios from already high levels.  
The Survey of Terms of Business Lending showed that the weighted- average interest  
rate spread on C&I loans of less than $25 million was about unchanged in May, after adjusting for non- price loan characteristics.  The share of originations by branches and 
agencies of foreign banks declined compared with that from three months ago, while the 
share of loans in riskier loan categories rose slightly.  The weighted- average adjusted 
spread  on loans made under commitment with a credit line of less than  $1 million —a 
proxy for lending to smaller firms—ticked down slightly but remained very elevated. 
On a seasonally adjusted basis, M2 contracted in April but surged in May.  A 
significant portio n of this swing wa s likely attributable to tax payments by households 
that were unusually low this year.  The l ower payments likely tempered both the usual 
buildup in liquid deposits in April in advance of the tax date and the runoff of those deposits in M ay.  Averaging across the two months, M2 grew at a 3½ percent annual rate 
after having been about unchanged in the first quarter, with liquid deposits increasing  at 
an average annual rate of 10 percent.  Currency growth continued to exceed its subdued pace of late 2009 and early 2010, probably due to a further expansion of foreign demand.  Retail money market mutual funds, which experienced rapid outflows in the first four 
months of this year, attracted inflows  in May, likely reflecting  in part investors’ p ullback 
from riskier asset classes  and the tax -related effect noted above.   Small time deposits 
continued to contract rapidly in April and May, as short- term interest rates remained 
extremely low.

Financial DevelopmentsOver April and May, the monetary base contracted at an average annual rate of 20 
percent, driven by a decline  in reserve balances that primarily resulted from a drop in 
usage of the Federal Reserve’s credit and lending facilities and an increase in the 
Treasury’s accounts with the Federal Reserve.   Over the inte rmeeting period, primary 
credit outstanding declined about $6 billion, but total reserves increased $ 45 billion, 
owing to the settlement of previously purchased MBS and a reduction in the Treasury’s 
general account  (see the box on the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet ).  In preparation  for 
possible future reserve draining  operations, the Federal Reserve conduct ed its first small-
scale auction  to test the Term Deposit Facility  in June (s ee the box on the Term Deposit 
Facility ). 
 
1 To avoid fails to deliver of relatively scarce securities , the Desk has used dollar rolls to effectively postpone 
the settlement of certain transactions.  These dollar rolls are projected to continue to settle through the fall.

 Balance Sheet Developments over the Intermeeting Period 
The Federal Reserve’s to tal assets edged up 
modestly over the intermeeting period to 
$2.4 trillion, as securities held outright 
increased a bit and lending through liquidity 
and credit facilities fell slightly.  
During the intermeeting period, securities held 
outright rose $31 billion, reflecting the net 
settlement of $33 billion of agency mortgage-
backed securities (MBS), which was partially 
offset by the maturing of $2 billion in agency 
debt securities.  Although the Desk completed 
purchases of agency MBS under the large-
scale asset purchase (LSAP) program in March, some agency MBS purchase 
transactions and dollar roll transactions 
conducted by the Desk continued to settle.
1 
Liquidity provided to financial institutions declined, on balance.  Primary credit outstanding dropped $6 billion to about 
$140 million, its lowest level since March 
2008.  Most of the decline represented a loan 
repayment by a single institution.  In response 
to the reemergence of strains in global U.S. 
dollar short-term funding markets, in early 
May the FOMC authorized a resumption of 
the temporary dollar liquidity swap lines with 
several major central banks, but use has been 
limited.
2  Swaps outstanding under the 
reestablished arrangements peaked at $9 billion in mid-May and now stand at 
$1.2 billi on.
  
Most of the assets that remained in the Commercial Paper Funding Facility LLC 
(CPFF) at the time of the April FOMC 
meeting—which represented investments of 
the fees paid by issuers that sold commercial 
paper to the facility—have been liquidated 
and the LLC is expected to be dissolved in the 
near future.
3 
Prepayments reduced lo ans extended through 
the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan 
Facility by about $2 billion.  No loans secured 
by newly issued commercial mortgage-backed 
securities were requested at the May 19 
subscription, and it is virtually certain that 
there will be no loan requests before the 
facility closes on June 30. 
On the liability side of the Federal Reserve’s 
balance sheet, the U.S. Treasury’s 
supplementary financing account remained 
steady at $200 billion, while the Treasury’s 
general account fell $56 billion over the 
period, on net.  This decline was roughly 
offset by an increase in Federal Reserve notes 
in circulation and a rise in reserve balances of 
depository institutions of $45 billion to about 
$1.1 trillion.

Financial Developments The First Small-Value Term Deposit Facility Auction 
On May 28, 2010, the Federal Reserve 
announced a series of small-value auctions of 
term deposits under the new Term Deposit 
Facility (TDF).  The small-value offerings are 
 designed to ensure the effectiveness of TDF operations and to provide eligible institutions  with an opportunity to gain familiarity with term deposit procedures.  The first auction, 
which offered $1 billion of 14-day term 
deposits, was conducted on June 14 and will 
settle on June 17.  This auction allowed 
relatively small noncompetitive bids that were 
awarded in full at the stop-out rate determined 
in the competitive auction.   
By the time of the first auction, 357 depository 
institutions (DIs) had registered to participate in 
the TDF.  As noted in table 1, these DIs 
recently held about $560  billion in reserve 
balances, representing about 52 percent of total 
reserve balances.  By number, most of the 
registered DIs are small institutions that, in 
aggregate, hold about $45 billion in reserve 
balances.  The 31 large and foreign DIs that 
have registered recently held about $520 billion 
in reserve balances. As shown in table 2, the first auction was well- 
subscribed, wi th c
ompetitive bids of a little 
above $6 billion and a bid-cover ratio of 6.14.    
Noncompetitive bids amounted to about 
$152 million, resulting in total awarded term 
deposits of $1.152 billion.  There were 
194 bids, including 156 competitive bids from 
71 DIs.  In general, the automated processes 
supporting the auction worked well, and DIs 
successfully placed their bids. 
In the competitive portion of the auction, bids were submitted by and awards made to a range 
of DIs including large banks, foreign 
institutions, small banks, and thrifts.  Bids 
ranged from 20 basis points to the allowed 
maximum of 75 basis points, with most bids at 
or below 40 basis points.  The stop-out rate was 27 basis points, 2 basis points above the interest 
rate on excess reserves.  In all, of 156 bids, 
18 bids from 13 DIs were accepted in this 
portion of the auction.
1
In the non
competitive portion of the auction, 
38 bids were submitted, nearly all from smaller 
DIs (small commercial banks and thrifts).  Each 
bid was accepted at its tendered amount, which 
was the $5 million maximum for about two-
thirds of the bids.

 Risks and Uncertainty 
ASSESSMENT OF FORECAST UNCERTAINTY  
We continue to see the risks around our projection for economic activity as 
elevated relative to the average experience of  the past 20 years (the benchmark used by 
the Committee).  On the domestic front, the depth and length of th e recession have been 
unmatched in recent history, and the fact th at the downturn originated in a severe 
financial crisis makes it qualitatively different  from other postwar contractions.  Because 
of these differences, gauging th e likely strength of recovery is  particularly difficult, and 
we see sizable risks on both si des of our projection.  In addi tion to these domestic risks, 
several European countries face considerable  fiscal and financial stress, leading to 
substantial uncertainties about the effects of  these strains on European economic activity, 
world financial markets, and real activity in the United States.  While outcomes in Europe 
could be more or less favorable than we ha ve assumed in the baseline, we place non-
negligible odds on an adverse tail event in which developments in Europe trigger a 
systemic financial and economic crisis that spills over to the United States; one possible 
scenario along these lines is  described in the box titled “Consequences of a Severe 
European Sovereign Debt Crisis.”  Taking acco unt of this possibility and other factors, 
we judge the risks to our pr ojection of real activity as  skewed to the downside. 
We also see the risks around our inflati on projection as elevated relative to the 
experience of the past 20 years.  In many dimensions relevant for the inflation outlook, 
we are in uncharted territory.  Recent readings on actual inflation have been exceptionally low.  The size and nature of the adverse shocks to activity were extraordinary, and 
identifying the supply and demand components of these shocks is particularly difficult, 
making estimation of the output gap especially difficult.  Moreover, a number of other 
factors are outside the range of historical experience.  The fede ral funds rate is effectively 
at the zero lower bound, the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet has expanded dramatically, 
and fiscal policy is deemed by many to be on an unsustainable path.  Weighing these 
risks to both the upside and downside, we c ontinue to see the risks around our inflation 
projection as roughly balanced.

1 More details of this scenario, along with alternative vers ions of the scenario, are discussed in the memo to the 
Committee, “Macroeconomic Consequences of a European Debt Crisis,” by Christopher Erceg, Jesper Linde, 
and David Reifschneider (June 11, 2009).
Risks & UncertaintyConsequences of a Severe Europe an Sovereign Debt Crisis  
A number of European countries are facing 
significant fiscal strains,  the outlook for European 
 economic activity has weakened, and many banks in the region are vulnerable to potential credit 
losses.  The baseli
ne projection does not envision 
the current situation escalating into a systemic problem.  But further adverse events could 
exacerbate the situation and intensify investor 
concerns, thereby triggering a severe financial and 
economic crisis.  In this box, we use a simulation 
of the staff’s multicountry DSGE model, SIGMA, 
to consider a severe “tail-risk” scenario in which 
concerns about the so lvency of European 
governments intensify sharply and generate adverse spillovers to the United States.
1
A European debt crisis could play out in many 
ways.  In this scenario, we assume that solvency concerns cause sovereign debt yields in Europe to 
jump 150 basis points on average this summer.  
To forestall further er osion in confidence, 
European governments cut spending by an average of 2 percent of GDP, restraining aggregate 
demand appreciably.  Higher interest rates and 
slower economic activity are in turn assumed to 
lead to large credit losses at European banks, with the result that financial stress increases markedly 
and prompts a flight to safety.  All told, European 
corporate bond yields jump 275 basis points, and 
corporate equity prices decline 35 percent relative 
to baseline—a deterioration in credit conditions 
somewhat less extreme than that experienced by 
the United States in the fall of 2008.  Moreover, 
the euro depreciates a further 30 percent against 
the dollar.  This constellation of financial shocks, 
coupled with fiscal restraint, pushes Europe back 
into a recession.  Real GDP contracts at an 
average annual rate of around 4 percent over the second half of this year and 2011, and inflation 
falls below zero for a time. 
A protracted European recession, coupled with a major depreciation of the euro and other 
currencies against the dollar, would restrict real 
activity noticeably in the United States through 
standard trade linkages.  But a bigger threat to 
the U.S. economy would be the financial 
spillovers that would likely accompany such a 
crisis.  To account for these effects, we assume 
that the European crisis triggers financial shocks 
in the United States and the rest of the world 
broadly similar to those that Europe experienced 
during the U.S.-centered financial crisis in late 
2008.  Specifically, we assume that risk 
premiums outside of Europe jump at the onset of 
the crisis; as a result, yields on U.S. BBB-rated 
corporate bonds increase more than 1 percentage 
point and equity prices fall about 20 percent 
relative to baseline.  In addition, U.S. banks 
tighten lending standards, and consumer and business confidence falls.  Finally, U.S. Treasury 
yields decline modestly relative to baseline, in 
part because of sa fe-haven effects. 
With financial conditions becoming significantly more restrictive, the U.S. economy falls back 
into recession in the second half of this year and 
real GDP does not star t expanding again until 
late 2011, as shown in the figures on the next page.  As a result, the unemployment rate peaks 
at just over 11 percent late next year.  Some of 
this rise in unemployment is associated with 
adverse supply-side effects that temporarily raise 
the effective NAIRU, and thus does not put 
downward pressure on prices.  Nevertheless, the

resource utilization, and the expectation of this 
greater slack, when coupl ed with the effects of 
dollar appreciation and lower import prices, temporarily leads to deflation.  Beyond 2011, the 
U.S. economy recovers as th e crisis abates and as 
the federal funds rate, following the prescriptions of a simple policy rule, remains at extremely low 
levels relative to baseline until the middle of the 
decade.  This sluggish, accommodative policy 
response implies that output will be above its 
potential over the second half of the decade.  As a 
result, near-term inflation expectations are 
temporarily elevated in the middle of the decade, 
pushing actual inflation above 2 percent for a 
time. Outside of Europe and the United States, the 
consequences of a debt crisis would likely be 
less severe due to greater scope for monetary 
policy action.  Thus, policy rates in the rest of 
the world are assumed to fall sharply on average 
for several years, making  the decline in real 
output in those countries only half as great as it is in the United States.  Much of this monetary 
buffering of real acti vity occurs through 
exchange rate effects—the currencies of these countries depreciate 10 percent against the 
dollar—that are partially at the expense of real 
activity in the United States and Europe.
 
  
                                                 
1In the SIGMA policy rule, the measure of slack is the difference between actual output and the 
model's estimate of the level of output that would occur in the absence of slow adjustment in wages and 
prices.  The interest rate paths implied by this rule are roughly similar to those implied by FRB/US in the 
simulations considered here.

  ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS  
To illustrate some of these risks, we c onsider a number of alternatives to the 
baseline projection using simulations of sta ff models.  In these scenarios, the federal 
funds rate is assumed to respond to movements in real activity and inflation as prescribed 
by a simple policy rule.  We generate most of the scenarios using the FRB/US model and 
the same policy rule for the federal funds ra te as that detailed in the long-run outlook 
section of the domestic outlook discussion, with nontraditional policy assumed to follow 
the baseline path.  The firs t scenario, however, is gene rated using the multicountry 
SIGMA model, which uses a somewhat different  policy rule that employs an alternative 
concept of resource utilization.1
Normalization in Europe 
 In our baseline forecast, Europe’s un settled financial conditions will persist 
through the remainder of this year before gradually improving.  In this scenario, we instead assume a more rapid normalization of European financial condi tions that restores 
confidence in global economic prospects and trig gers a decline of the dollar as safe haven 
flows unwind.  Specifically, the broad real  dollar depreciates immediately 8 percent 
relative to baseline, with the decline heavily concentrated against the euro, and European 
economic activity increases about 1 percentage point per year faster than in the baseline 
through the end of next year.  The effects on U.S. real GDP are amplified by an assumed 
10 percent rise in equity pr ices and a fall in BBB-rated co rporate bond spreads of 60 basis 
points.  All told, U.S. real GDP increases about 1 percentage point  faster, on average, 
through next year.  U.S. core PCE inflation rises about ½ percentage point above baseline 
through the first half of 2011 in response to higher im port prices and a narrower output 
gap.  The nominal trade balance as a percen t of GDP improves about 1 percentage point 
in 2011.   
Stronger Recovery 
In the baseline projection, we have marked down the outlook for real activity 
noticeably, putting important weight on negati ve signals coming from abroad and from 
financial markets.  However, incoming data  suggest that the economic recovery has 
become more firmly established, and in this  scenario we assume that the U.S. economy

Page 74 of 96has more underlying momentum than we have assumed in the baseline.  Accordingly, the 
recovery in spending on househol d durables and business equi pment, as well as outlays 
for construction—both residential and nonresid ential—occurs one to  two years sooner 
than in the baseline.  In addition, financia l conditions improve more quickly, with the 
result that corporate equity prices are 30 percent above baseline by the end of next year, 
further boosting aggregate spending.  All told, real GDP expands at an average annual 
rate of about 5¼ percent th rough the end of 2011, causing the unemployment rate to drop 
to 7½ percent by late next year and to th e NAIRU by the end of 2013.  With less slack, 
inflation is higher.  Under these conditions, th e federal funds rate begins to rise in mid-
2011 and remains above baseline thereafter. 
Weaker Consumption 
 Alternatively, the recent increases in consumer spending may reflect a bounce 
from unusually depressed levels.  In this scenario, consumer uncertainty and further 
household deleveraging push the hou sehold saving rate higher.  The slower recovery in 
spending, in turn, feeds back adversely on fi nancial markets, further restraining real 
activity.  All told, the personal saving ra te rises to 6 percen t by the end of 2011—
2 percentage points above base line; equity prices climb mo re modestly and, by late 2011, 
are nearly 15 percent below baseline.  As a consequence, the improvement in the labor 
market is delayed, and the unemployment rate only declines to 9¼ percent at the end of 
2011; the additional slack reduces inflation 1¼ percentage point below baseline by 2012.  Lower inflation and weaker real activ ity call for a longer period of accommodative 
monetary policy, and the federal funds rate re mains near zero until the first half of 2013.  
This additional monetary stimulus, together with an assumed gradua l return of spending 
to long-run fundamentals, causes real GDP to  expand more rapidly than in the baseline 
starting in mid-2012.  
Jobless Recovery 
As the economic recovery continues and c onfidence improves, we anticipate that 
firms will boost payroll employment noticeabl y, relieving some of the pressure on their 
existing workforces and causing labor productivity to increase for a time more slowly than its trend pace.  In this scenario, we instead assume that labor productivity expands 
through the end of next year at its tr end rate of about 2½ percent per year—
1½ percentage points faster than in the baseline.  These larger productivity gains are 
driven by a combination of permanent shoc ks to structural productivity and more 
transitory factors, where the latter reflect firm s’ reluctance to hire in  the face of continued 
   
  
Risks & Uncertainty

June 16, 2010
Page 75 of 96uncertainty about the outlook.  We assume that the same caution leads firms to rely more 
on increases in the workweek to boost labor input than in the baseline.  Finally, the 
slower pace of hiring is assumed to erode household confidence.  Under these 
assumptions, real GDP follows its baseline path through the end of next year and the unemployment rate remains close to 10 pe rcent during that period.  Over time, 
households and firms eventually become more confident about the future and recognize 
the more favorable long-run conditions implied by higher structural productivity.  As that 
occurs, aggregate demand picks up, and real  GDP accelerates noticeably relative to 
baseline after 2011.  Lower unit labor costs and lower levels of resource utilization 
combine to push inflation below ½ per cent from mid-2011 to mid-2013.  In this 
environment, the federal funds rate lifts off from the effective lower bound in mid-2013, 
a year later than in the baseline. 
Lower Potential 
The NAIRU and potential output are difficult to measure, and we could be 
misjudging the degree of slack in the economy.  In particular, the long-run implications 
for the labor market of the sharp increases in  unemployment in general, and in long-term 
unemployment in particular, could be more a dverse than in the baseline.  Moreover, the 
impairment of the financial system and its repercussions for the broader economy have been both larger in magnitude and different in  nature from what ha s typically occurred in 
previous downturns.  Reflecting these risks, in  this scenario we assume that the current 
level of potential output is lower than the staff assumes due to both a higher NAIRU and 
a lower level of structural productivity, so that output is currently 3¼ percent below 
potential, instead of 7 percent as in the baseline.  These mo re pessimistic assumptions for 
potential output imply lower long-run levels  of household income and corporate earnings, 
and thus less consumption and investment over time.  Accordingly, real GDP expands 
1¼ percentage point less per year on average through 2014 than  in the baseline, and the 
unemployment rate declines more slowly.  Pr ices accelerate more noticeably than in the 
baseline:  Core PCE inflation rises to 1¼ percent in 2011 and move s up to 1¾ percent in 
2014; this acceleration reflect s both the direct effects on marginal cost of lower 
productivity as well as a smaller margin of slack.  Policymakers gradually take on board 
the evidence of less-favorable  supply-side conditions, and in response to less slack and 
higher inflation, monetary policy begi ns tightening early next year.

Page 78 of 96Greater Disinflation 
In the baseline, inflation remains relativ ely stable through ne xt year and then 
begins to rise as unemployment declines in  an environment of well-anchored inflation 
expectations.  But inflation expectations coul d prove to be less stable than we expect 
given persistent weakness in labor and product markets.  In this scenario, both expected 
and actual inflation fall signi ficantly, by magnitudes that ar e roughly in line with the 
predictions of many reduced-form forecasting equations.  As a result, inflation runs 
below zero from 2012 on, causing the federal f unds rate to remain near zero until late 
2013.  The more accommodative monetary policy stimulates aggregate spending, and real 
GDP expands faster than in the baseline during 2013 and 2014. 
Higher Inflation 
Many outside forecasters anticipate highe r inflation than in the staff outlook 
despite similar or more pessimistic outlooks for the real economy.  The “Lower 
Potential” scenario described one set of factor s that could lead to hi gher inflation than in 
the staff’s projection; here we consider other possibilities.  One risk  is that we may be 
reading too much into the recent soft infla tion numbers, with the consequence that the 
deceleration in underlying inflation could be  more modest than we have implicitly 
assumed.  Another possibility is that the shift to above-trend growth will place more 
upward pressure on inflation than we expect through “speed effects,” with commodity 
and other prices reacting to the rate of cha nge of activity.  In this scenario, inflation 
follows a path consistent with outside forecasters’ consensus, which we read as 
anticipating core PCE inflation of  about 1½  percent next year.  In the face of this higher 
inflation, the policy rule prescribes raising the federal funds rate  starting in mid-2011, a 
year earlier than in the baseline and closer to the interest rate outlook of some outside 
forecasters.  The tighter monetary polic y tempers aggregate demand, so real GDP 
expands somewhat more slow ly than in the baseline. 
OUTSIDE FORECASTS  
Compared with the Blue Chip consensus forecast released in early June, the staff 
forecast of real GDP growth is about the same  this year but is higher next year; indeed, 
by the end of 2011, our forecast for real GDP gr owth is similar to that of the 10 Blue 
Chip respondents with the highest forecasts of  real activity.  Regarding inflation, private 
forecasters expect CPI inflation to move up to 1.9 percent in 2011, as compared with the 
staff forecast of 1.1 percent; by the end of 2011, our inflation outlook is similar to that

  held by the 10 respondents with the lowest fore casts for inflation.  The staff assumptions 
about interest rates are below those of the Blue  Chip consensus.  As for revisions to the 
consensus forecasts since early May, the re al activity outlook is  about the same, the 
inflation projection has revised down a bit, a nd the interest rate forecasts are somewhat 
lower.

    1. Budget receipts, outlays, and surplus/deficit include corresponding social security (OASDI) categories. The OASDI surplus and the Postal Service surplus are excluded from the on-budget
    surplus and shown separately as off-budget, as classified under current law.
    2. Other means of financing are checks issued less checks paid, accrued items, and changes in other financial assets and liabilities.    3. Gross saving is the current account surplus plus consumption of fixed capital of the general government as well as government enterprises.
    4. HEB is gross saving less gross investment (NIPA) of the federal government in current dollars, with cyclically sensitive receipts and outlays adjusted to the staff's measure of potential output and the
NAIRU. Quarterly figures for change in HEB and FI are not at annual rates.  The sign on Change in HEB, as a percent of nominal potential GDP, is reversed.  FI is the weighted difference of discretionarychanges in federal spending and taxes in chained (2005) dollars, scaled by real GDP.  The annual FI estimates are on a calendar year basis. Also, for FI and the change in HEB, positive values indicateaggregate demand stimulus.
