IN BROAD REVIEW
Information becoming available recently indicates that the
domestic economy has remained firmly on its expansion course without
stimulating any widespread advance in prices. Read literally, the
drop in unemployment from the February-April level of 5.4 per cent to
the May figure of 5.1 would suggest a breakthrough, but this improve-
ment resulted partly from lack of increase in the labor force and may
not be sustained. Industrial production, which rose a full point in
April, apparently showed little change in May, but this development
also may not be of great significance.
Improvement was shown by retail sales which rose in May
to a level above the February high, following some hesitation in March
and April. Similarly, the stepped-up rate of inventory accumulation
in April and manufacturers' plans for a higher rate of accumulation
in the second and third quarters were indications of strengthening demands.
The official June survey of business plans for new plant
and equipment outlays raised the estimate for the year to 12 per cent,
as an unofficial survey had reported in April; the survey reported a
higher first quarter level than indicated earlier, but the rise for
the remainder of the year was not so rapid.
In the financial area, bank credit expansion in May was
somewhat greater than in earlier months this year, perhaps reflecting
in part the rise noted in inventory buying. The private money supply
declined in May, but time deposit growth was a little larger than in
March and April. For the first five months of this year, the rate of

I- 2
monetary growth was barely half that in late 1963. Time deposit
expansion also has been less rapid than in late 1963. Free reserves
declined sharply in Hay to $85 million, as member bank borrowing
increased. The May average was slightly below that of February-
March. Interest rates have generally shown little change with the
key 3-month Treasury bill rate continuing below the discount rate.
The decline in stock market prices after mid-May may have
been a moderating influence on financial expectations, although most
analysts have interpreted the drop as a technical correction following
the sharp rise from late November to mid-May.
The U. S. balance of payments deficit for the year to date
has apparently been around $1-3/4 billion, seasonally adjusted annual
rate. The annual rate of trade surplus in April was $6 billion,
compared to $7 billion in the first quarter.
Capital outflows on new foreign security issues, including
some arranged a year ago, were larger in April and May than in earlier
months.
The leveling of U. S. exports in recent months has paralleled
a leveling--perhaps temporary--in total imports of leading foreign
countries. In March-April, imports of France and Italy were somewhat
reduced from the peaks they reached in January-February, in contrast
to continuing import expansion in Germany and the Netherlands, as well
as in the United States.

THE DOMESTIC ECONOMY
Industrial production. Calculation of the May index is not
yet complete but available data--including production worker manhours--
indicate little change from the record April level of 129 per cent of
the 1957-59 average.
Auto assemblies in May were at the record April level of
160 per cent of the 1957-59 average and production schedules for June
call for another month of high output. Truck production continued at
advanced levels in May. Steel ingot output was maintained and production
of paperboard and electric power remained at record rates.
Sales of new domestic autos in May were at a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 7.8 million compared with 7.7 million in April
and 7.2 million a year ago. Stocks declined slightly and on May 31
totaled 1.2 million, one-fourth above a year earlier. Sales of used
cars changed little and were 3 per cent above last year. Used car
prices, an indicator of the strength of demand for new cars, were at
advanced levels and in April were 5 per cent above a year earlier.
Labor market. The labor market strengthened somewhat
further in May but probably not as much as suggested by the decline
in the unemployment rate to 5.1 per cent from 5.4 per cent in the
three preceding months. Employment showed a moderate increase, of
which three-fifths was in agriculture and of little cyclical significance.
The labor force changed little. In contrast both employment and the
labor force rose sharply in April.

II -2
Major age-sex groups showed different patterns of change in
May. For adult men the unemployment rate declined to 3.6 per cent from
3.8 per cent in April as employment rose and the labor force was
relatively stable. Among women unemployment was reduced, to 5.0
per cent from 5.4 per cent, because of withdrawals from the labor force,
following a sharp increase in April. Unemployment for younger workers,
however, remained at 16 per cent and both employment and the labor
force increased somewhat. Growth in the number of youths in the labor
force was smaller than anticipated.
CHANGES IN LABOR FORCE, EMPLOYMENT AND UNEMPLOYMENT
(April-May, seasonally adjusted, in thousands of persons)
Labor Force Employment Unemployment
Men, 20 years and over 29 117 -88
Women, 20 years and over -145 -52 -93
Both sexes 14-19 128 130 -2
Total 12 195 -183
All of the May decline in unemployment was among the short-
term unemployed. Longer-term unemployment, 15 weeks and longer, totaled
935,000, about the same as in the preceding month, but 180,000 fewer
than a year ago. With the increased growth of younger workers in the
labor force over the past year, youths account for a larger proportion
of the long-term unemployed.
The civilian labor force in May was 1.6 million larger than
a year earlier, with most of the increase taking place since December.
The rise over the year compares with a projected growth of 1.2 million.
According to this Census household series, nonagricultural employment

II -3
increased 2.2 million from May of last year. This was a substantially
larger rise than shown by the establishment (payroll) series. A large
part of the difference is attributable to a rise in the number of youths
and women reported working part-time in self-employment and domestic
service activities not included in the establishment count.
Consumer spending. On the basis of sales data through May,
consumer purchases of goods and services are estimated to show a further
sizable advance in the second quarter. Expenditures for both durable
and nondurable goods, as well as for services, appear to be up. The
rise is unlikely, however, to equal the $8 billion annual rate of
increase in the first quarter, unless June spending is very strong.
The rise is also unlikely to match the sharp rise in consumer after-
tax incomes, and--as generally anticipated--the saving rate will increase.
On a monthly basis, retail sales in May renewed their
advance after some hesitation in March and April. After allowance for
seasonal influences, sales probably exceeded the February peak. Both
durable and nondurable goods sales in May were up from April. The
April-May average is more than 1 per cent higher than the first quarter,
with sales up at both durable and nondurable goods stores.
Revisions in sales data were negligible for March but the
original April estimate was raised by about 1 per cent. As a result,
April now shows an increase of 0.6 per cent from March rather than a
slight decline.

II -4
Consumer credit. Extensions of consumer instalment credit
in April, at an annual rate of $64-1/2 billion, were close to the
record highs of recent months. Extensions were a little lower relative
to sales in the principal lines concerned. An expected increase in
automotive credit extensions failed to materialize despite the rise
in automotive sales; dollar volume of nonautomotive sales financing
dipped although sales were generally well maintained at department,
furniture and appliance stores. It is not yet clear whether the marked
strength in autos and soft goods indicated for May was reflected in a
speed-up of new consumer borrowing.
Repayments on instalment debt continued in April at the
record annual rate of almost $60 billion and outstandings rose at an
annual rate of about $5 billion, somewhat less than the average
increase over the past year.
Business plans for fixed capital outlays. The new Commerce-SEC
quarterly survey, with most questionnaires returned in May, shows a
planned increase of 12 per cent in business spending on plant and
equipment in 1964. This compares with a rise of 10 per cent reported
by Commerce-SEC in March and is about the same as the McGraw-Hill
estimate reported in April. Total spending for the year is now
anticipated to be $43.9 billion, compared with the earlier figure of
$43.2 billion. (Confidential until release)
Much of the upping of plans for the year reflects larger
actual expenditures than had been anticipated earlier for the first
quarter, as may be seen in the table. The levels for the second quarter

II -5
and for the second half of the year are also raised, but by progressively
smaller amounts, and the increase from first to fourth quarters implied
by the new figures is smaller than that implied earlier.

Most notable is manufacturing, for which a rise of 16 per cent
is now indicated for the year, with increases planned in each quarter,
compared with 13 per cent in the preceding survey. Within manufacturing,
prospective spending in nondurable goods industries has been increased
considerably, mainly in chemicals and petroleum which now show
prospective increases of 14 and 20 per cent, respectively. The over-all
change in durable goods is small: motor vehicles now show a planned
rise of 32 per cent, above the March survey but still well below
McGraw-Hill. Nonelectrical machinery has also been revised up, with
a prospective increase of 14 per cent. So has electrical machinery,
but indicated spending here is still below the 1963 level.
The higher level of spending shown in the new Commerce-SEC
survey is generally in line with the Newsweek-National Industrial
Conference Board, May survey of new capital appropriations by manufacturers.
Appropriations in the first quarter of this year were only a little less
than the relatively large amounts in the third and fourth quarters of
last year. (The fourth quarter appropriations shown by the February
survey were revised up sharply.) Significantly, the greatest strength
in the first quarter appropriations was in nondurable goods industries,
particularly chemicals, rubber, and oil, whereas strength earlier had
been in durable goods industries.
Business inventories. Expansion in business inventories
stepped-up to nearly $450 million in April. The rise compares with an
average monthly increase of less than $200 million in the first quarter.
Business sales also increased more rapidly in April and the over-all
stock sales ratio remained at the unusually low first quarter level.

II -7
The rise of $200 million in factory stocks in April was about
the same as the average monthly increase during 1963, and it consisted
of moderate gains in work-in-process and finished goods, mainly in
durable goods industries. Stocks of materials and supplies declined
somewhat in both durable and nondurable goods industries. Steel
inventories held by steel consuming manufacturers edged down in April
to the December level and was otherwise the lowest since March 1963.
Mill stocks of finished steel were unchanged in April at an unusually
high level.
The April rise of $250 million in retail inventories followed
two months of little over-all change. From January to March stocks of
durable goods had increased, mainly because of autos, while nondurable
goods stocks had drifted off. In April, auto stocks showed little
further rise while nondurable goods stocks recovered the earlier decline
and were about the same as in January.
Inventory anticipations. According to the latest Commerce
quarterly survey conducted in May, manufacturers are still pursuing
conservative inventory policies. They anticipate a total inventory
increase of $400 million in the second quarter and $700 million in the
third quarter. Most of the expansion is planned for the durable goods
sector. These increases are well above the unusually low first
quarter rise of about $150 million and compare with the average quarterly
increase of $600 million in 1963.

II -8
Manufacturers expect sales to continue to increase. Durable
goods sales are estimated to rise at a rate of 2 per cent a quarter and
nondurable goods sales, at a rate of 1.3 per cent a quarter, from the
first to the third quarter. With such increases, manufacturers'
inventory-sales ratios would decline somewhat further from the low
first-quarter levels.
Construction activity. New construction put in place in May
continued unchanged from the record rate established in March. Over
this period, both private and public construction activity remained at
levels only moderately different from earlier highs reached toward the
end of last year.

Seasonally adjusted construction contracts, as measured by
F. U. Dodge Corporation, tended down further in April from the record
December rate. The April rate was a tenth above a year earlier, however,
and, based on the unusually large volume of contracts accumulated in
recent months, Dodge expects that the high spring rate of construction
expenditures will at least be maintained through this year.

II -9
Mortgage markets. Mortgage funds have continued ample in
recent months, but pressure to acquire mortgage holdings has been
less intense than a year earlier when the rate of savings inflows to
financial institutions was higher. As a result, purchases from FNMA
have continued far below last year's record level and some lenders
have become more restrictive, particularly on loans for marginal
types of apartments and other income properties.
Delinquency rates on home mortgages moved downward from the
fourth quarter of 1963 to the first quarter of this year, according
to the regular survey of the Mortgage Bankers Association. Delinquency
rates on conventional loans held or serviced by reporters in this
survey were slightly above a year earlier, however, as can be seen
in the table.

Based on a recent survey of real estate appraisers by the
Chase Manhattan Bank, 36 per cent of the respondents did not consider
the rate of foreclosures on residential property to be a problem;
54 per cent considered it only a minor problem, and 10 per cent ranked
it as a major problem. About 74 per cent of the appraisers considered
market values for real estate to be either basically sound or
undervalued.

II -10
Prices. In May and early June the wholesale commodity price
index and the broad components for industrial commodities and foodstuffs
continued essentially stable. The total index has shown little net change
this year and has remained within its narrow range of the past 6 years.
Prices of foodstuffs are slightly lower than at the end of 1963 and the
average for industrial commodities is unchanged. The current level for
industrial commodities--100.8 per cent of the 1957-59 average--is 1/2
per cent higher than in early 1963, about the same as in early 1961, when
activity was at a recession low, and 1/2 per cent lower than at the cyclical
peak in early 1960.
Prices of most basic or sensitive commodities also have changed
little in recent weeks. Although industrial demand for copper remains
strong, prices in the London market have declined moderately, following
a sharp rise, and the Chilean Government reportedly no longer is pressing
for an increase in the price quoted by producers. The expiration of many
labor contracts at midyear still is a source of major uncertainty in copper
markets. At the end of May list prices for a wide range of aluminum sheet
and plate were reduced to reflect actual transactions prices. Subsequently,
the aluminum ingot price was raised 1/2 per cent, or 2 per cent. There
were rumors that prices of sheets, plates, and other products were now
being raised to reflect the higher ingot price. In another metals area,
one producer of stainless steel has initiated a 5 per cent reduction in
published prices for standard grades of sheets and plates.
Among foodstuffs, winter wheat has declined in anticipation of
the lower Federal loan rate that takes effect July 1. Sugar has declined,

II -11
falling almost to the levels prior to the sharp rise a year ago, as supply
prospects have improved. Livestock prices, on the average, have been
unusually stable in recent months. Prices are about a tenth lower than
a year ago, reflecting a substantial expansion in market supplies.
The consumer price index increased .1 per cent in April, and
was up 1.5 per cent from a year earlier. Average prices of foods and of
nonfood commodities were unchanged in April, but the index for services
rose somewhat, reflecting increases for golf green fees, movie admissions,
auto insurance, and medical care.
From December to April, the CPI showed a net increase of .2
per cent--a little less than in the first four months of last year and
considerably less than two years ago. The difference reflects mainly the
behavior of food prices, which showed less than the usual seasonal rise
this year, after a less than the usual decline last autumn.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL SITUATION
Bank credit. On the basis of the new seasonal adjustment factors
total loans and investments at all commercial banks increased $1.7
billion in May, after declining somewhat in April. Growth in May was
above the average monthly increase earlier this year and brought the
annual rate so far this year to 6.6 per cent, somewhat below the 8
per cent expansion in 1963, as shown in the table below.
Total loans increased $1.8 billion in May, also above the
average earlier this year. While the loan growth rate of 12.7 per cent
through May was somewhat faster than in late 1963, this difference
largely reflected the temporary decline in seasonally adjusted security
loans in December.

Holdings of U. S. Government securities, after allowance for
seasonal changes, declined slightly further in May. So far this year,
liquidation of these holdings has been somewhat faster than in 1963.
Banks acquired about half of the $1 billion Treasury bill issue on
May 6, but at city banks bill sales over the month more than offset new

III -2
acquisitions. All holdings under 1 year increased, however, as the
volume of maturing securities exchanged for longdr-term issues was more
than offset by substantial passage-of-time portfolio shifts. Holdings
of municipal and Federal agency issues increased at about the same
moderate rate as earlier in the year but sharply below the reduced rate
of late 1963.
Business loans at all commercial banks, seasonally adjusted,
increased $400 million in May, slightly more than the average monthly
increase earlier in 1964 but much less than in late 1963. In recent
weeks, loan demand appears to have strengthened appreciably in the
metals, miscellaneous manufacturing and mining, and trade categories,
possibly reflecting in part some acceleration in inventory accumulation.
Also, borrowing by the construction industry has accelerated somewhat.
Seasonally adjusted real estate and consumer loans continued
to increase through May at about the same pace as in other recent months.
This was slightly less rapid, however, than the expansion over the
year 1963 and in the case of consumer loans considerably slower than
in the early months of that year. Loans to nonbank financial institutions
showed little further change in May and have increased only slightly
so far this year.
Money supply, deposit turnover and time deposits. The
seasonally adjusted money supply declined $200 million in May (based
on the new unpublished seasonals) following a $900 million expansion
in March and April. A reduction in the first half of the month was
offset in part by an increase in the second half, and a further rise

III -3
is expected for the first half of June, on the basis of preliminary data.
Through May the annual rate of growth was about 2 per cent, a little less
than half as much as the average rate in the last half of 1963. The
increase in U. S. Government deposits in May was about the same as
in May of other recent years.
Turnover of demand deposits at 343 centers outside New York
declined to 35.4 (preliminary) in May from the recent peak of 36.1
in April. The May rate, however, was higher than in any other month
preceding April; turnover had shown little net change between July 1963
and March 1964. Over the past two months turnover averaged 7-1/2
per cent higher than in the corresponding months last year.
Seasonally adjusted time deposits at all commercial banks, on
the basis of the new seasonals, increased $1 billion in May, somewhat
more than the increases in March and April but less than the $1.3
billion average over the previous six months. Through May, growth in
these deposits was at an annual rate of 10.9 per cent compared with
14.7 per cent over the year 1963.
At city banks over the four weeks ending May 27, growth in
both savings deposits and in other time deposits was comparable with
that in the corresponding four weeks last year. This contrasted with
earlier months this year when expansion in savings deposits had been
below the 1963 rate while growth in other time deposits had been faster.
Bank reserves. Free reserves averaged $85 million in May,
considerably below the $160 million level in April but only slightly
below the February and March averages. Excess reserves reached a

III -4
new postwar low of $340 million and borrowings averaged $255 million,
somewhat more than in April but less than the average of most other
recent months. The effective rate on Federal funds fell below 3-1/2
per cent on only one day during May and early June and transactions
below this level occurred on only three days.
Seasonally adjusted reserves against private demand deposits
after a sharp rise in the week ending May 6, declined substantially over
the succeeding three weeks. They rose again in the week ending June 3,
but still remained below their peak level in the week of April 22.
Reserves required against U. S. Government deposits rose substantially
over this entire period, as is usual.
Corporate and municipal bond markets. The recent rally in
corporate and municipal bond prices petered out near the end of May.
Since then prices and yields have stabilized, with yield series on
State and local government issues holding close to their yearly lows.
Yields on new corporate bonds, on the other hand--which had risen to
new highs for the year early in May under the stimulus of an expanded
calendar of public offerings--are currently well above their 1964
lows. Spreads between yields on long-term corporate, and State and
local and U. S. Government bonds have thus increased--the latter to
27 basis points, the widest margin of the year.

The average yield on new issues of corporate bonds turned up
slightly at the end of May, when a number of utility offerings that had
been aggressively priced by underwriters during the May rally failed to
attract much investor demand. Last week, syndicates on several of
these slow-moving issues were terminated, and unsold balances were
distributed at yields only slightly above those prevailing on more
recent offerings. Some overhang of unsold supply persists, however,
and the market is currently marking time, awaiting the results of
this week's $150 million GMAC offering. The total volume of new
corporate security offerings expected in June is substantially larger
than in May, but the increase is wholly attributable to private place-
ments and stock issues. Public offerings of bonds are likely to be in
smaller volume, and the calendar beyond June for all new corporate
securities so far promises to show its usual summer lull.
In the State and local government securities market, aggressive
pricing of recent offerings has also led to investor resistance, and
dealers' advertised inventories of unsold issues haveagain swelled to

III -6
more than $600 million. With new issue volume in June also scheduled
to be up from May, municipal dealers are suggesting that prices may
show a little near-term weakness.

Stock market. Common stock prices, as measured by Standard
and Poor's composite index of 500 stocks, have declined 2-1/2 per cent
on balance from the record high reached at mid-May to 79.14 on June 9.
Over the same period, trading activity has slackened, averaging about
4.5 million shares a day.
The bulk of the recent stock price decline has occurred since
May 22, the end of the six months capital gains holding period for
investors who bought stock during the market break following President
Kennedy's assassination. Many technicians had been anticipating a
technical market reaction in view of the 18 per cent stock price advance
from late November to mid-May, and the earlier tendency for the market
to over-discount the expected economic effects of the Federal tax cut.
Further selling was triggered late last week when the Dow-Jones
industrial average broke through the low end of the range within which
it had fluctuated for two months. Some analysts interpreted this

III -7
decline as a signal that the Dow-Jones average was likely to drop
below 800 before a new base would develop.
Many observers are assuming that the recent stock price
decline will be short-lived. This view seems to be based on the
recent performance of business, an expectation that tax-cut effects
will cumulate as the year progresses, and a resultant anticipation of
further increase in corporate profits.
U. S. Government finance. The Treasury's cash balance has
continued to run above projections, largely reflecting continued
moderation in expenditures. The balance could build up from a June
9 level of $5.6 billion to $9 billion or more at the end of the fiscal
year.
The indicated large balance will help the Treasury finance
in July a seasonal cash drain of around $5 billion and $2.0 billion
of 1-year bill maturities. Net cash borrowing for July may be in the
order of $3 to $3.5 billion, or even less if the balance builds up
beyond current expectations. Market observers generally expect the
Treasury to auction a March tax anticipation bill in early July to
meet the bulk of this need, although some observers have not ruled
out the possibility of some coupon financing. The Treasury is also
expected to continue its weekly bill auction of $2.1 billion during
July, thereby raising a total of $300 million in three successive
auctions when $2.0 billion weekly bills mature.

Going into the period of seasonal cash need, the Treasury note
and bond market has been quiet. Following its recent rally in the first
half of May, the market has continued to display a firm undertone, however,
reflecting a moderate amount of investment demand offset by relatively
limited retail selling. Some selling has appeared on investment switches
into the new 4-1/4's of May 1964, but this market supply has been
readily absorbed by dealers and other investors.
The key 3-month bill rate has fluctuated in a very narrow range
since early May, holding between 3.46 and 3.49 per cent bid. The yield
on 6-month bills has declined, however, reducing the spread between
3- and 6-month bill rates to about 10 basis points. The spread between
these issues was around 15 points in early May and about 20 points in
the first half of April. In part, the recent declines in 6-month bill
rates appear to reflect a conviction among market participants that
short-term rates may not rise very much--if at all--in the near future.
Thus these investors have been more willing to reach out for even
slightly higher yields on longer bill maturities.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
U.S. balance of payments. The U.S. deficit on regular
transactions for 1964 to date (through the first few days of June) is
estimated at around a $1-3/4 billion annual rate, seasonally adjusted.
Among factors contributing to the widening of the deficit since the
first quarter have been a decline in the monthly trade surplus, which had
reached a peak in January, and a pickup in capital outflow for new foreign
security issues in April and May. The estimate for the year to date is
based on unadjusted deficits of $475 million for April (revised) and
$65 million for May and early June (highly tentative), and it assumes a
$100 million upward seasonal adjustment for these two periods combined.
In April the trade surplus declined to a $6 billion annual rate,
which compares with about $7 billion in the first quarter. Exports de-
clined slightly in April, and were back to the average level of the
preceding four months. Imports, which had risen sharply in March, in-
creased a little further. In March-April, imports averaged about 5 per
cent above the plateau of the second half of last year; the rise reflects
primarily higher purchases of finished manufactures and semi-finished
materials.
U.S. private capital outflows continued large through April --
apart from direct investment, for which data are not available -- with
some shifts in composition of the outflow. The outflow on new foreign
issues, mainly Canadian, rose from $30 million per month in the first
quarter to more than $100 million in each of April and May. This
included takedowns on issues arranged a year earlier. But the outflow

IV -2
on long-term bank loans declined in April, from a first-quarter monthly
average of $70 million to $30 million.
The composition of outflows represented by short-term claims
on foreigners also altered. The outflow of bank loans and acceptance
credits has declined since January, and in March-April this outflow
was only about half the very high rate that persisted from October
through February. Net short-term bank credit outflow to Japan, which
had fallen substantially in March, dwindled further in April.
Offsetting the decline in bank credit outflows, there was a
pickup in outflow of liquid funds of U.S. banks and others. The net
outflow of this sort in April was almost entirely into U.S. dollar-
denominated deposits in Canada. (Only partial information is available on
the outflows reported by nonfinancial concerns.)
International trade. In contrast to the recent pickup in U.S.
imports, imports of other leading industrial countries appear to have
leveled off -- but perhaps only temporarily -- this spring. At a
1/seasonally adjusted annual rate of nearly $69 million- in March-April,
the total imports of the seven countries listed in table on p. IV-4, were
virtually unchanged from their first-quarter average, as increases in
Germany and the Netherlands were offset by decreases in France and Italy.
There was little change in imports of Britain, Canada, and Japan. How-
ever, British imports of manufactures and semimanufactures were continu-
ing to rise, the general trend of Canadian imports was probably still
upward, and a resumption of the rise in Japanese imports interrupted
since January may now be occurring.
1/ Includes freight and insurance for all but Canada.

IV -3
The divergent developments in trade in recent months can be
related to the French and Italian stabilization programs and to the
continuing growth of domestic demands in other countries, which in
some cases is at a more moderate pace than during 1963. In Germany, the
trend of domestic demand is clearly expansive. New orders received by
Germany industry made a new high in April, and the March-April average
was 2 per cent above January-February, with a rise especially in domestic
orders. Given the continuing expansion in demand, no great significance
attaches to the fact that industrial production in March-April averaged
1 per cent under the preceding pair of months. In the Netherlands, an
upward adjustment of wages and prices has been taking place, following
the breakdown of Dutch wage policy last October. By January prices of
manufactured goods had risen 5 per cent. In France and Italy, on the
other hand, current evidence continued to point to success of efforts
to restore economic balance. But for Italy, in particular, wage restraint
will be a key problem in the months ahead. Through the first quarter of
1964 there was still no slowing in the rise of wage rates, typified by
a 15 per cent rise of wage rates in industry from 1962 to 1963 (annual
averages).
In Britain, demand is continuing to expand. Industrial
production at 127 (1959 = 100) in March (preliminary) was equal to
February's which has been revised up and now shows a 1 point rise over
January. Auto production rose sharply in April, to a new high. Prices
and wage rates rose more rapidly in April than earlier this year;
compared to April 1963, wage rates were up 4 per cent, prices of

IV -4
manufactured products sold domestically 3 per cent, and retail prices
2 per cent. In Japan, industrial production picked up in April, after
its dip in March. Japanese imports, which had eased off from their
peak in January, increased in April.

Before the recent leveling, imports of the seven countries had
risen 6 per cent from the fourth quarter of last year to the January-March
quarter. Expansion of imports was particularly rapid at that time in
Germany, Britain, and the Netherlands. Also, among smaller industrial
countries not included in the table, Belgium, Sweden, and Denmark had
sharp import increases in the first quarter.
Over the interval of fifteen months from the final quarter of
1962, imports of the seven leading countries rose by 23 per cent. This
rise included an 19 per cent increase in imports of the five leading
European countries from outside Western Europe. While this rapid rise

IV- 5
in imports of other industrial countries facilitated the 13 per cent
rise in U.S. exports from late 1962 to the first quarter of 1964, even
more significant for the improvement of the U.S. balance of payments
has been the deterioration in the balance of trade of Western Europe
with the rest of the world in recent years.
A relevant comparison is with the first half of 1960, when the
European business cycle was in a phase similar to the present. As may
be seen in the bottom pair of charts following p. IV-6, Western Europe's
exports to countries outside the area declined slightly from the first
half of 1960 through the latter part of 1962 while imports increased,
and since then the increase in such exports has failed to match the
further increase in imports. Rough adjustment of the data to exclude
the freight and insurance element contained in the European import
statistics leads to the conclusion that the total worsening of Western
Europe's trade balance between the first half of 1960 and the first
quarter of 1964 was about $6 billion at a seasonally adjusted annual rate.
Worsening also occurred in Japan's balance of trade over this
period. With imports adjusted from the c.i.f. to f.o.b. basis, this
deterioration amounted to about $1 billion, all of which developed in
the past year and a half.
Within the complex structure of world trade, counterparts to
the worsening of European and Japanese trade balances can be found in
export gains exceeding import increases since early 1960 for Canada
and Australia (about $1-1/2 billion for the two combined), for petroleum
producing countries (somewhat less than $1 billion), for other primary

IV -6
producing countries (apparently less than $1 billion net, with a
deterioration through 1962 partly financed by increasing economic
aid, followed by improvement in 1963), and finally for the United
States (about $3-1/2 billion).
Further improvement in the U.S. trade balance in the year
ahead obviously depends either on a further worsening of net'European
and Japanese trade balances -- on the whole now looking rather unlikely --
or on successful competition by United States with the other industrial
countries for a share of whatever increases in import balances may occur
in the rest of the world.
Exchange market developments. Exchange market rumors of a
possible revaluation produced a substantial movement into German marks
in early June, and the Bundesbank took in about $125 million through
exchange market operations. Spot sterling dropped sharply in early June,
with some outflows from sterling into Euro-dollars on a covered basis
contributing to a decline in the discount on the forward pound; since
late May the sterling spot rate has fallen about 1/2 cent. The increase
in the Netherlands Bank discount rate last week produced only a very
temporary strengthening of the guilder, and by June 9 the guilder had
reached the lowest rate in more than a year.

APPENDIX A: A BRIEF REVIEW OF THE POSTWAR RECORD OF THE LEADING INDICATORS
The relationship of movements in the leading indicators to
aggregate economic activity is shown in this chart for the four most
recent cycles. The leading indicators are represented by the confidential
Census weighted composite index for 8 NBER leading series, and aggregate
economic activity is represented by the corresponding Census index for 6
NBER roughly coincident series.
In this chart these indexes have been segmented for each cycle
measured from peak to peak, starting from the initial peak as 100. Thus,
October 1948 is used as the base for the 1948-53 cycle; July 1953, for
the 1953-57 cycle; August 1957, for the 1957-60 cycle; and May 1960, for
the current cycle.
The leading indicators, in the words of Julius Shiskin, "fore-
shadow turning points in the business cycle.. .They are -in a manner
of speaking -signals of things to come." A quick look at the chart tends
broadly to confirm this characterization, but a closer look reveals that
the leading indicators have behaved with considerable ambiguity at critical
times and that, by and large, their "signal" --both for upturn and downturn--
has shown a very short lead.
During that phase of expansion periods when the leading indicators
first level off or decline there has been a fairly close coincidental slow-
down in the rate of increase in aggregate economic activity. Either devel-
opment--the behavior of the leading indicators or the behavior of the
coincident indicators--could be taken as the "signal of things to come."
However, these initial declines in the leading indicators, which show up
fairly conspicuously on the chart and which in the past were accepted as
the first signal of the subsequent recession, are now fairly generally
considered "false signals." The sharp break in 1951 and the moderate
1962 decline are cases in point. The declines in 1956 and 1959 are less
clear. These are appropriately regarded as false signals: In each expan-
sion period, after the initial decline in the leading indicators, aggregate
economic activity continued to move up and the leading indicators them-
selves began to rise again. Once the leading indicators stopped declining,
and started rising again, in effect their preceding signal was nullified
or, at least, held in abeyance until the scope of the rise under way was
revealed.
In the current expansion, the secondary rise in the leading
indicators has continued to the present, carrying them to new peaks.
In contrast, in each of the three preceding upswings the secondary rise
topped out at a level below the initial peak and was followed by some
decline; this development occurred quite late in the expansion period
and presumably constituted the recession "signal" by these indicators.
Unfortunately, this signal was obscured somewhat at the very end of
each expansion period when this set of leading indicators leveled off

A -2
or rose. The clearest and most unambiguous decline took place for the
leading indicators after the recession began.
A brief look at the details of the behavior of the leading
indicators in each expansion period is given below.
In the 1949-53 expansion the record of the leading
indicators was quite ambiguous, as the chart shows. The initial decline
(rated as a false signal) extended from early 1951 to the spring of
1952. This was followed by a brief rise and then stability from
September 1952 to March 1953. This leaves the brief but rather sharp
decline from March to June as the warning signal of the 1953-54
recession, and perhaps it can be accepted as such despite the fact
that it was temporarily reversed by an abrupt pick-up in the month
of the cyclical peak, July 1953.
In 1954-57, this index of leading indicators reached a peak
in September 1955 and again in April 1956. The decline from April
to July 1956 marked the "recession scare" of that period, during the
course of which industrial production first edged off and then, in
July with the help of the steel strike, dropped by a fair amount.
Industrial production rose to new highs in late 1956, and the leading
index recovered moderately, in effect cancelling the signal of the
earlier decline. The leading index then declined in early 1957 and
this would seem to be the signal of the 1957-58 recession, although
the signal was subsequently obscured when the leading index stabilized
in the last few months of the expansion. As Julius Shiskin commented
in his book, "Signals of Recession and Recovery," "Just before the
[1957-58] contraction did start, the signs of it [i.e., the evidence
of the indicators], were no more decisive than they had been about
a year earlier ...."
In the 1958-60 upswing, the leading--as well as the
coincident--indicators were considerably influenced by the anticipation,
actuality, and aftermath of the protracted 1959 steel strike. The
leading indicators reached a peak in late spring of 1959 at the height
of the anticipatory build-up and then declined, in effect, "signaling"
the steel strike. The end of the strike brought a secondary peak for
the leading indicators. Between January and March 1960, the index
declined, and this would presumably be the decline related to the
1960-61 recession. Here again, however, the record was somewhat
confused when the index leveled off in April and May just before the
recession began.
The leading indicators gave the current upswing a very poor
send-off, showing the smallest initial rise of the postwar period and
this modest rise turned unusually promptly into an appreciable decline
in the second quarter of 1962. This decline and the subsequent several
months of little change were associated with a slow-down in the rate
of increase in over-all economic activity, and a protracted leveling
off of industrial production, and this combination of events generated

A- 3
widespread expectations of a recession. Recession failed to materialize,
marking another false signal for the indicators. From late 1962 to
date the leading indicators have been rising.

APPENDIX B: NET BUDGET EXPENDITURE ON AGRICULTURE
It now appears that projected reductions in net budget expendi-
tures for agriculture in fiscal 1964 will not be realized. In the Budget
Document, spending on agriculture was expected to be held to $7.0 billion
in 1963-64 and to $5.8 billion in 1964-65 as compared with an actual
expenditure in 1962-63 of $7.7 billion. Most of the cuts were expected
to be in price stabilization activities of the CCC.
Net expenditures in 1963-64 are now expected to be about $8.0
billion,$1 billion higher than the earlier estimate, with most of the
difference accounted for by CCC expenditures. Gross outlays by CCC are
running close to expectations but receipts from sales of CCC stocks of
wheat and feed grains are lower than expected and bank investment in CCC
certificates of interest is about $450 million below the estimated figure.
It now looks as if CCC receipts from 1963-64 sales of wheat for
export will fall short of expectations by about $200 million. Sales of
feed grains in domestic markets from the pool of feed grains representing
emergency acreage retirement certificates will also be short about $300
million. In the case of feed grains the CCC is priced out of the domestic
market by a statute setting the minimum sale price at the loan rate plus
carrying charges. These and other smaller drains had reduced CCC borrow-
ing authority of $14.5 billion to $131 million by June 4, 1964. This means
that the CCC will be pinched for funds until the beginning of the next
fiscal year on July 1, 1964.
In fiscal 1964-65, it appears that estimates of net farm
expenditures will have to be raised above the budget estimates to take
into account larger expenditure on cotton and feed grain stabilization
programs, and possibly smaller bank investment in certificates of
interest.
