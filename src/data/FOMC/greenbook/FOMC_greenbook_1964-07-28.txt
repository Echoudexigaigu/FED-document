IN BROAD REVIEW
Steady expansion in economic activity with relative stability
in commodity prices have continued while monetary expansion has accelerated.
The Treasury has met with success in extending the maturity of the debt
through its recent large advance refunding.
Economic strength is reflected in a wide range of indicators
of demand, including the rise in industrial production, now estimated at
4 per cent for the six-month period since December; the apparent advance
in retail sales in July from the record May-June level; the further expansion
in backlog orders of durable goods producers; and the further marked rise
in GNP in the second quarter, a rise limited by continued quite modest
accumulation of business inventories.
These favorable indications of balanced strength are not, how-
ever, the full story. Unemployment is still high while the rate of ex-
pansion in employment has been tapering off. Available evidence suggests
some downward tendency in housing construction despite the moderate June
rise in starts. While backlogs rose again, new orders to producers of
durable goods declined slightly further in June.
Few marked changes in the factors underlying the U.S. balance
of international payments are evident, as the summer period of usual
seasonal strain unfolds. French and Italian imports have continued to
decline under the influence of anti-inflationary monetary and fiscal
policies. British imports, however, rose sharply in June. Revised
figures on the U.S. payments deficits in May and June are somewhat lower
than those previously reported.
Interest rates abroad have tended to rise in recent months.
To back up policies of domestic credit restraint, the Italian and

I- 2
Japanese authorities have issued instructions to hold down Euro-dollar
borrowings by their banks. Germany has raised bank reserve requirements,
and acted at the same time to restrain foreign borrowing by its banks.
Looking to more specific facts of interest, it may be noted
that:
-- Industrial production rose further in June to 131.8
per cent of the 1957-59 average, 5 per cent above
June 1963.
-- GNP was $618.5 billion in the second quarter as
compared with a revised $608.8 billion in the
first quarter. In real terms, growth over a year
earlier also was 5 per cent.
-- Inventory accumulation in the second quarter was
estimated at a modest $3 billion annual rate and
inventory-sales ratios were at new lows for this
expansion period.
-- Personal income rose a little further in June to
a level of 5.7 per cent above a year earlier.
-- Housing starts rose somewhat to nearly 1.6 million
units, annual rate, but continued appreciably below
their highs of last fall.
-- Nonfarm payroll employment rose 100,000 in June
and was 1.5 million above a year earlier.
-- Hourly earnings of factory workers were unchanged
in June and up less than 1 per cent since December.
The comprehensive wholesale price indexes showed no
change in June for both the total and for industrial
commodities. Industrial commodities continued stable
through mid-July.
-Repayments of business and finance company loans
in the 3 weeks following the mid-June tax period
were large, but the decline in total city bank
credit was moderate.
-- Money supply growth in the first half of July con-
tinued large, amounting to $900 million.

I -3
-- Free reserves averaged $105 million in the 3 weeks
ending mid-July, close to the average of most recent
months.
-- The Treasury advance refunding of $27 billion of
publicly held issues produced a record exchange of
over $9 billion with only a mild initial reaction
in U.S. Government securities market and with cor-
porate and municipal markets remaining relatively
steady.
-- The 3-month bill rate, after declining to a low of
3.42 in mid-July, returned to close to the discount
rate in the latest week.
-- Stock market prices rose to new highs on increased
volume but very recently have been below their peak.

THE DOMESTIC ECONOMY
Gross national product in the second quarter. Gross national
product increased to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $618.5 billion
in the second quarter from $608.8 billion in the first. (GNP has been
revised through the first quarter. See the appendix for an account of the
revision.) The increase of about $10 billion for the second quarter
was the same as in the first quarter and larger than in the corresponding
period a year earlier. In real terms, GNP in the second quarter was
5 per cent above a year earlier.
The second quarter gain was mostly attributable to a $6 billion
increase in consumption expenditures and a $4.5 billion rise in Government
purchases of goods and services. Gross private domestic investment was
up only $1 billion as further significant gains in business fixed
investment and only a small step-up in the pace of inventory accumulation
from the very low first quarter rate were in part offset by a moderate
decline in residential construction activity. Net exports of goods and
services declined over $1.5 billion from the exceptionally high first
quarter level.
The second quarter increase in consumption expenditures fell
short of the nearly $9 billion increase in the first quarter, although
disposable income increased 3 per cent as compared with 2 per cent in
the first quarter. One possible explanation is that the tax reduction
had been widely anticipated. Purchases of durable goods, which had
increased sharply at the beginning of the year, showed only a small
further gain in the second quarter. Nondurable goods were up about
1.5 per cent as compared with about 2.5 per cent in the first; these

II -2
increases combined represent the largest 6-month run-up in nondurable
goods expenditures since 1955.
The surprisingly large rise in Government outlays reflected
an abrupt pick-up in Federal purchases after four quarters of near
stability or decline, together with continued steady -expansion at the
State and local level. The spurt in Federal purchases presumably
reflected to an important extent an unusual bunching of defense purchases
at the end of the fiscal year.
Personal and disposable income. Personal income in June showed
about the same small rise as it had in May and reached a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of $489 billion, 5.7 per cent above a year earlier.
For the second quarter as a whole, owing in part to the sharp
spurt in April, personal income increased $7 billion, or 1.5 per cent,
slightly more than in the first quarter. Wage and salary disbursements
were up $5.5 billion for the quarter, the largest rise in 2 years.
The reduction in Federal income taxes, which had augmented
disposable personal income moderately in the first quarter, was fully
effective in the second quarter and disposable income increased $12
billion, or 3 per cent. This large rise was equally divided between
increased consumption expenditures and higher personal saving. Saving
as a per cent of disposable income which, at 7.0 per cent in the first
quarter, had held close to the rate prevailing in 1963, rose sharply
to 8.2 per cent in the second quarter.

II -3
Retail sales. Retail sales in July, on the basis of data
through July 11, appear to be up moderately from their record May-June
level, after allowance for seasonal influences. Both durable and
nondurable goods appear to be above June levels.
According to the advance report, total sales in June remained
unchanged from the record May level. Nondurable goods sales, reflecting
strength at food and apparel stores, were up 1.5 per cent but durable
goods sales, reflecting declines at automotive outlets, were down 3
per cent.

Consumer credit. Consumer instalment debt continued to rise
in the second quarter, although at a somewhat slower pace than earlier
in the year. June data on credit changes are still incomplete, but it
appears that auto credit was up somewhat less than in the preceding
month. This is consistent with the reduced volume of new car sales.
On the other hand, GAAF sales showed some improvement in June and credit
expansion in this area may have been larger than in May.--

II -4
In April and May, credit sales of new passenger cars accounted
for about three-fifths of the total number sold, about the same as last
year. The proportion almost always rises during the summer months
and by September--if the seasonal pattern of recent years prevails--
credit purchases are likely to account for three-fourths of all new car
contracts.
Employment. Gains in nonfarm employment have been smaller in
recent months than earlier this year. This tendency toward a slowing in
the rate of increase is particularly apparent when observed on a year-
over-year basis. In June nonfarm establishment employment was 1.5
million above a year ago, compared to a rise of over 1.7 million in
February. During the first half of 1963, year-over-year gains were
somewhat smaller but more stable.
YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE IN NONFARM ESTABLISHMENT EMPLOYMENT

March 1,621 1,338
April 1,629 1,170
Hay 1,491 1,238
June 1,471 1,286
In June nonfarm establishment employment rose about 130,000
while the household survey reported a substantial decline. Month-
to-month discrepancies between the establishment and household data
are not uncommon. When viewed over a longer period, however, the
employment increases in both series have been similar. Thus, if
domestic servants, the self-employed and unpaid family workers--which

II -5
are not included in the establishment data--are excluded from the
household survey, both series show employment gains of 1 million since
November 1963 and about 1.5 million from June of last year.
With the rate of gain in nonfarm employment apparently slowing
down, the number of additional workers hired each month has tended to
come more in line with growth in the labor force. In June, the civilian
labor force was 1.5 million above a year ago and for the first 6 months
the average increase was1.4 million. Since this rate of labor force
growth is likely to be maintained it will be necessary for employment
increases to accelerate if there is to be any appreciable reduction in
unemployment in coming months.
Most of the June rise in nonfarm employment was in State and
local government and in service industries. For the second consecutive
month construction and trade employment showed little change. Manu-
facturing employment continued torise slowly with most of the improvement
concentrated in metal-working industries. In transportation equipment
industries, employment declined for the second month reflecting some
slowing down in auto production and defense activity.
Unemployment of youths. Between April and June, 3.2 million
persons 14-24 years of age were added to the labor force, about the same
number as in 1902 and 1963. Most of this increase occurred between May
and June when students entered the labor force at the end of the school
year. The unemployment rate for teenagers, which rose markedly during
1963, has been fluctuating around the 15 per cent mark this year. Among
those 20-24 years of age, unemployment rose in June to 9.2 per cent

II -6
reflecting greater difficulty in finding jobs in the nonfarm sector
than in previous years. For nonwhite teenagers, the unemployment rate
in June was 33 per cent; for the 20-24 year group, the rate was 15 per cent.
Approximately one-third of the younger workers who entered the
labor force between April and June were unable to find jobs. For teenagers
the proportion was slightly less than last year, but substantially more
than in 1962. In contrast, among those 20-24 years of age an increasing
proportion has been unable to find jobs in the past two years. About
1 out of 3 of those who entered this summer were unemployed in June
compared to only 1 out of 5 in 1962.

Hours and earnings. Average hours of work in manufacturing
have remained relatively high and in June were 40.6 hours, down only .1
from May. The combination of relative stability in both hours and
employment has meant that manhours of production workers have not increased
since April. With output rising steadily, output per manhour for all

II -7
employees in manufacturing continued to increase in the second quarter
and was about 4 per cent above a year earlier.
Hourly earnings remained unchanged in June at $2.53 and were
up 7 cents or about 3 per cent from a year ago. Since December 1963,
hourly earnings have gone up only 2 cents or less than 1 per cent. This
was the smallest first half year rise in hourly earnings since the
recession year of 1954. In part, the slower rise reflects continued
emphasis of unions on pensions and other benefits rather than on wage
rate increases.
In the oil industry, a two-year agreement was recently
negotiated with one major producer providing for earlier retirement and
increased vacation benefits. There was no wage rate increase in the
new contract. This agreement is expected to set the pattern for other
companies in the industry. A similar agreement emphasizing improved
pension and insurance benefits was signed by the three major films in
the rubber industry. In both industries full retirement will be at
age 62 rather than at 65, with substantially higher pension payments
than before.
Production. Industrial production rose further in June to
131.8 per cent of the 1957-59 average--one-half per cent above May
and 4 per cent above December 1963. In June output of final products
and materials increased.
Among consumer goods, production of television sets recovered
from a strike and output of furniture and of consumer staples rose.
Auto assemblies remained at record levels, and production schedules

II -8
for July indicate little change. In the business equipment industries,
output of industrial machinery increased appreciably further in June.
Production of iron and steel changed little but small increases were
widespread among other materials.
Seasonal factors for the industry groupings of the production
index have been revised back to January 1961. The revision of the
seasonal factors has tended to raise the total index in the first
quarter of the year and to lower it in the third quarter as shown below
for 1963.

Dealer deliveries of new domestic autos in the first 10 days
of July, on a daily average basis, were 7 per cent below a month ago
and unchanged from a year earlier. Deliveries of new cars to some
Eastern auto dealers have been curtailed by a trucking strike. Stocks
increased and at 1,327,000 units were 29 per cent above last year.
Output has not been curtailed and the undelivered cars, stored on
manufacturers' lots, are credited to dealers' inventories.
Sales of used cars declined less than seasonally in early
July and were at about the year-ago level. Stocks declined somewhat
and were 3 per cent below a year earlier.

II -9
Prices. Comprehensive mid-month statistics show that from
May to June the wholesale price index was unchanged as both industrial
commodities and foodstuffs were essentially stable. Through mid-July,
according to the weekly estimates, industrial commodities remained
stable while prices of foodstuffs increased, chiefly because of
seasonal reductions in supplies of meats and eggs. Thus the total
index rose somewhat, but the mid-July level of 100.5 (1957-59=100)
was about the same as a year earlier.
Increases in prices of hogs and choice cattle since early
June reflect a variety of factors, some temporary and some likely to
persist for a time. Through the rest of 1964 hog prices are likely to
be above year earlier levels because of sharp reductions in pig crops
since the fall of 1963. The major factor in the upswing in fed cattle
prices has been a substantial decrease in supplies, a situation that
is not likely to be sustained beyond the summer period because of
the record numbers of beef cattle reaching marketing age.
The June price statistics show that the nonferrous metals
group has been stable since April, following a rise of 6 per cent in
the preceding year. For lead and zinc, the supply situation has been
improved by significant increases in domestic production this year and
by the recent legislation that permits the sale of specific quantities
of these metals from the U.S. stockpile. For copper, supplies apparently
were great enough to permit increases in stocks as a strike-hedge.
Since labor contracts expired at the end of June, production of copper
has been reduced by strikes affecting a third of the domestic industry.

II -10
Tin prices have increased very sharply again, despite the passage of
legislation to permit the sale of the remaining "surplus" tin in the
U.S. stockpile.
The latest monthly statistics also showed a further decline
in the cotton products group to a point 2-1/2 per cent below the first-
quarter level as markets responded to the lower cost of raw cotton
for domestic use. More recently, however, prices of some cotton textiles
have turned up.
Orders for durable goods. New orders received by manufacturers
of durable goods declined slightly further in June from the record April
level but for the second quarter as a whole were up 3 per cent from the
first quarter.
June was featured by two large and mostly offsetting changes:
a drop in the electrical machinery and aircraft industries, which
presumably reflected one of the typical large fluctuations in defense
orders; and a recovery in new orders for primary metals to about the
advanced April level. New orders for nonelectrical machinery edged off
but were up substantiallyfor the quarter as a whole.

New orders remained well above the level of shipments in
June and unfilled orders increased for the sixth successive month. At
the end of the month the order backlog was up 7 per cent from the end
of 1963.
Business inventories and sales. Seasonally adjusted book
value of inventories decreased about $250 million in May, with declines
reported by producers and distributors. The April inventory increase
has been revised substantially upward to $625 million. For the two
months accumulation averaged as low as in the first quarter when book
value increased $200 million a month. In the GNP accounts, inventory
accumulation was estimated at an annual rate of $3.0 billion in the
second quarter compared with $2.5 billion in the first.
In May, as in April, business sales rose substantially. The
April rise had been concentrated in manufacturing, whereas the bulk
of the May increase was at wholesale and retail distributors. In all
three sectors, stock-sales ratios in May were at lows for this expansion
period.
The table below compares changes in sales and inventories
in the first quarter and in April-May this year with corresponding changes
a year earlier. In the first 5 months of this year, sales increases
were larger than in 1963 (particularly at distributors), while the
over-all inventory increase was similar in both years.

Construction and real estate. New construction put in place
changed little in June following a downward revision in May. At $65.1
billion in June, the seasonally adjusted annual rate was only moderately
below the highs reached in March and April, and was 5 per cent above
a year earlier. For the first half year, the gain over a year earlier
was 8 per cent.
Private housing starts, which had declined appreciably in April
and May, returned to a 1.6 million seasonally adjusted annual rate in
June. The second quarter average of 1.5 million was 8 per cent below
the high first quarter rate and 4 per cent below the second quarter of
1963.i I

Building permits also recovered somewhat in June. Permits

Vacancy rates for rental properties in the second quarter edged

per cent in the second quarter of 1961. Inside metropolitan areas,
vacancy rates declined further to 7.2 per cent; outside such areas,
they rose sharply to 7.8 per cent after a decline of nearly two years.
Rates in the West turned up--in part seasonally--almost to their
advanced year-earlier level, while in the North Central states they
dropped to a 5-year low.
Mortgage markets. Secondary market yields on 30-year,
FHA-insured, 5-1/4 per cent mortgages on new homes remained at an average
of 5.45 per cent in June, for the fourteenth consecutive month.
Contract rates on conventional mortgages also continued unchanged in
June, according to the Federal Housing Administration, at an average
of 5.80 per cent for loans on new homes and 5.85 per cent for loans
on existing homes.

Other terms on conventional first mortgages on homes tended
to firm slightly in May, the latest month for which data from the

than a year earlier.

rate but below the record rate in the last two quarters of 1963.

rate of increase of debt on multifamily and commercial property continued

Crop prospects. The survey of crop conditions on July 1
indicated that another year of large production is in prospect. Total
acreage of crops harvested will probably be slightly above that of 1963,
and 2 per cent above the low for the century reached in 1962. Bay and
pasture conditions averaged somewhat better than a year ago.
Increased production is in prospect for food grains, soybeans
and sugar crops. Production of feed grains somewhat less than in 1963
is indicated by a reduction of 4 per cent in acreage planted.
Participation in the feed grain acreage retirement program is a record
high this year; diversion payments may run as much as $950 million.
No estimate of production of cotton was made, but planted
acreage was only 1 per cent less than in 1963. This suggests that
relatively few farmers elected to retire acreage under the new cotton
stabilization program enacted in April. The Act reduced the basic
price support on the 1964 crop by 10 per cent and gave farmers a
choice among three planting plans. They could (1) plant their full
allotment and receive the basic price support of 30 cents per pound;
(2) plant two-thirds of their allotment and receive 15 per cent
additional price support on their normal yield; (3) plant 5 per cent
in excess of their allotment, with the production on the additional
acreage tagged for export at the world price. Neither of the new
options, 2 or 3, has been chosen by many farmers, probably because
of the late date of enactment of the program,

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL SITUATION
Bank credit. In the three weeks following the June tax and
dividend period, total loans and investments at city banks declined
about $400 million. This was in line with the changes in the comparable
weeks of the previous two years, after allowance for the large Treasury
financing in late June of 1963. Credit expansion during the tax
and dividend periods of the three years also had been about the same.

The contraction in total loans since the tax period has been
quite moderate relative to the expansion during the tax period. Holdings
of investments also have shown a small decline, with a moderate rise
in holdings of other securities about equalling a reduction in holdings
of U.S. Government securities.
Recent repayments on loans extended directly or indirectly
to businesses during the tax period have been unusually large,
suggesting that the flow of internal funds relative to current outlays

III -2
of businesses continues highly favorable. In the latest three weeks,
the total decline in business loans and loans to finance companies
offset about three-fourths of the mid-June rise, compared with
offsets of less than one-third during the comparable weeks of the
two preceding years.
Business loan repayments have been particularly heavy in the
metals and trade groups, where outstandings already are considerably
below the pretax period level, which is unusual. On the other hand,
outstanding loans to public utilities and the miscellaneous manu-
facturing and mining group advanced further after the tax period, which
is also unusual.
Loans to U.S. Government securities dealers advanced contra-
seasonally in late June and early July, presumably associated with
payment for the 1-year bill on July 7 and acquisition of issues which
dealers expected might become rights in a possible advance refunding.
Real estate loans continued to rise steadily, but "other" loans,
which are mainly consumer loans, rose much more than usual.
Money supply and time deposits. Incomplete data suggest
that growth in the seasonally adjusted money supply in the first half
of July was about $900 million. This followed a $1.1 billion increase
from May to June and little increase in other recent months. Between
the first half of May and the first half of July, the annual rate of
growth was 9.3 per cent, but between December and the first half of
July, the rate was 4.2 per cent. U.S. Government deposits declined
slightly in early July as is usual for this period.

III -3
Seasonally adjusted time and savings deposits at all commercial
banks are estimated, also on the basis of preliminary data, to have
increased about $300 million in the first half of July. This is about
the same as in late June but well below that of early June and May.
In recent weeks, the increase in savings deposits at city banks continued
to be less than a year earlier; expansion in other time deposits was
also less, although through May, these deposits had increased slightly
more than in comparable months of 1963. Outstanding negotiable CD's
rose $240 million in the three weeks ending July 8 after declining
$320 million over the tax period. At New York City banks, the increase
has been larger than the tax-period decline, while at outside banks
it has been considerably less.
The seasonally adjusted annual rate of turnover of demand
deposits at banks in 343 centers outside New York averaged 35 in June,
down a little from May. In the second quarter, however, turnover
increased, averaging 3.3 per cent above the first quarter and 7.7
per cent above the second quarter of 1963.
Bank reserves. Free reserves averaged $105 million over the
three weeks ending July 15, close to the average of most recent months.
Both excess reserves at $420 million and member bank borrowings at $315
million, however, were higher than in earlier months. The effective
rate on Federal funds remained at 3-1/2 per cent during the 3 weeks
ending July 15 and transactions took place below that rate on only one
day.
Seasonally adjusted reserves against private demand deposits
increased somewhat further over the three weeks ending July 15;

III -4
sharp expansion in the week of July 8 was offset in part by earlier
and subsequent reductions. Reserves required against U.S. Government
deposits declined, as reductions in the two latter weeks of the period
more than offset an earlier rise associated with the build-up of
Treasury balances in late June.
U. S. Government finance. The U. S. Government securities
market has been dominated by the Treasury advance refunding announced
July 8. The refunding involved a record $26,6 billion of publicly-held
eligible issues and produced record exchanges of $9.3 billion. These
conversions amounted to about 35 per cent of public holdings, which
was higher than in the two previous advance refundings of September 1963
and January 1964, but about in line with earlier experience. Taken in
the exchange were $3.7 billion of the reopened 4's of 1969, $4.4 billion
of the new 4-1/8's of 1973, and $1.2 billion of the reopened 4-1/4's
of 1987-92.
The scope of the advance refunding and the subsequent size of
the exchanges were larger than had been anticipated. But the market
reaction remained generally mild throughout the exchange and in the
first trading sessions thereafter. From the time of the offering
announcement to July 20, when preliminary results were given, yields in
the intermediate- and long-term area rose from 3 to 6 basis points. At
the same time yields declined in the short coupon area.
It seems probable that some time will be required before
permanent investors absorb the new bonds issued in the advance refunding,
The dealers came out of the refunding with net holdings of nearly

III -5
$950 million of the new issues, and on July 16, total dealer positions
in bonds due in more than 5 years stood at a record $1,177 million.
The previous record of $951 million was set after last September's
advance refunding. Apart from dealer positions, speculative interest
in the two longer-term bonds is reported by a few market participants
to be slightly above normal.

The advance refunding put downward pressure on short-term rates
and in mid-July the key 3-month bill rate declined to a 1964 low of
3.42-3.39 per cent. A strong demand for bills developed from sellers of
rights to the advance refunding, and this demand was supplemented at
mid-month by reinvestment demand from holders of $2.0 billion maturing
1-year bills. Between July 7 and July 16, total dealer bill holdings
were reduced from a record $4.0 billion to less than $1.9 billion.
Their trading position fell to $825 million, the lowest level in nearly
a year. Dealers showed little concern over their comparatively small
positions, however, as most thought that the bill rate was only
temporarily low.

III -6
Since mid-July, bill rates have edged higher, reflecting
caution in the market over the increasing spread between U.S. and
U.K. bill rates, substantial sales of bills to the market by the System
and the Treasury, and the Treasury announcement of a $1.0 billion
bill strip auction on July 24.
The bill strip auction as well as the announced $1.0 billion
auction of 1-year bills in late July will anticipate most of the
Treasury's cash requirements for the third quarter. The Treasury
indicated that it would announce on July 29 plans for a short-term
financing to replace the $2.2 billion of maturing August issues which
were not exchanged by public holders in the advance refunding. After
this, the first large fall cash need will occur in October, when there
is a seasonally large monthly deficit.
Corporate and municipal bond markets. Markets for corporate
and municipal bonds showed little immediate response to the Treasury's
advance refunding. Although trading in recently offered corporate
issues tapered off while books were open on the Treasury operation,
demand for such issues picked up some thereafter, and their prices
edged higher. No recent quotation is available for the yield series
on new issues of corporate bonds--due to an absence of relevant
offerings; in the week of July 10, however, the series dropped to its
lowest level since February, and the yield spread between new and
seasoned issues turned negative.

III -7
In the State and local government bond market yields have
declined a little further recently despite the advance refunding,
reducing the average yield on high-grade issues to the 1964 low
reached in mid-May.

Recent strength in the corporate bond market has reflected
both the small current supply and the limited volume of prospective
offerings. Unsold syndicate balances are less than $50 million, and
present estimates indicate that public offerings of new issues are
likely to remain light at least until Labor Day. In addition, recent
comments by Treasury officials have created expectations among corporate
underwriters that there will be no further competition from long-term
Treasury debt offerings over the remainder of the year.
On the other hand, the immediate technical position of the
corporate market may be a little weak. The spread between yields on
corporate bonds and the longest-term Treasury obligations has been

III -8
narrowed by the advance refunding, and secondary distribution of the
unexpectedly large volume of new longer-term issues growing out of
that operation may exert some further upward pressure on Treasury
yields.

In contrast with the calendar for new corporate issues, the
immediate supply of municipal offerings is quite large for the summer
season, nearly as large as last year's record when volume was swelled
by a $200 million advance refunding. In August, however, new issue
supply is likely to be substantially smaller; moreover, a significant
share of the remaining July volume is relatively short-term and should
attract a good demand from banks.
While municipal offerings in some earlier weeks this month
were also quite sizable, dealers' inventories of unsold securities
have been cut back from the rather high end of June level. Commercial
banks have reportedly been more active buyers of municipals in recent
weeks, and very recently a stepped up demand from fire and casualty
companies has been reported.

III -9
During the first five months of 1964 net acquistions of
municipal securities by commercial banks apparently accounted for a
little over half of the net increase in outstanding municipals. While
this proportion was down substantially from both the nearly 90 per cent
net acquisition ratio for 1962, and the 75 per cent ratio for all of
1963, it was above the 30 per cent bank share taken in the final
quarter of 1963. Since bank purchases of municipals are reportedly
concentrated in issues of relatively short maturity, one would expect
a drop in the bank net acquisition ratio to be reflected in a narrowing
of spreads within the municipal yield curve. As the table shows, such
a narrowing did in fact occur, particularly after mid-1963.

Stock market. Stimulated by the further expansion of
economic activity and by favorable initial reports on second quarter
corporate earnings, common stock prices have continued to advance.
The further advance has been less rapid than in June, however, and has
been punctuated by occasionaldeclines, reflecting profit taking and
market consolidation. Standard and Poor's composite index of prices
on 500 stocks closed on July 21 at 83.54, up more than 6 per cent from
the early June low and up about 3 per cent above the earlier peak,

III -10
for this year, reached in mid-May. Trading volume averaged 4.9
million shares a day in the first three weeks of July, 0.5 million
shares greater than the daily average for June.
Stock market credit continued to edge lower during June,
dropping another $45 million to $7.2 billion at month-end. A decline
of $66 million in customers' net debt balances at brokerage firms
was only partly offset by a $21 million increase in weekly reporting
bank loans to others than brokers or dealers.

U.S. balance of payments. Revised data for May and pre-
liminary data for June show a payments deficit, after special trans-
actions, of about $150 million for the two months, down sharply from
previous indications. The deficit on this basis for the second quarter
is now estimated at about $630 million before seasonal adjustment, and at
something over $700 million after adjustment.
There are indications that military export cash receipts fell
short of deliveries during the quarter. Thus the results given above
probably reflect a run-down of military advance payments, and the seasonally
adjusted balance on regular transactions may have been less, perhaps well
under $700 million. This compares with a deficit of $180 million in the
first quarter.
In May, the outflow of short-term and long-term bank credit
continued at the moderate April rate. Outflows of liquid funds into short-
term investments (as reported by banks and by nonfinancial concerns) were
still large, at $70 million compared with $130 million in April. Exports
remained at the April level while imports inched up slightly, and the
trade balance was little changed. These elements do not explain much of
the sharp decline between April and May in the over-all deficit.
Although total exports were unchanged in May, there were some
notable changes in composition. Exports to Japan declined approximately
10 per cent from the March/April average. On the other hand, exports to
Latin America continued to recover, reaching a rate about 10 per cent

IV -2
above the low of last October; and exports to other nonindustrial countries,
which had fallen since December, were up sharply in May, reflecting in
part increased P.L. 480 shipments. Exports to Europe and Canada were
unchanged from April.
The slight May increase in imports was wholly in imports of
materials; imports of finished manufactures remained at the advanced
April level, while imports of foods declined a little. There was no
further advance in the unit value (price) of coffee imports in May.
Business and financial developments abroad. In major industrial
countries there has been little further expansion in industrial production
in recent months -- i.e. through April or May -- except in Germany and
Canada. French and Italian imports have continued to decline, and one
consequence has been an easing of export orders in Germany. Business
capital expenditures are now the major expansive force in Germany, as they
are also in Britain. In Germany, Britain, and Japan, imports were fairly
stable from February through May, but in June British imports jumped to
a new high.
The French budgetary deficit for the first five months of 1964
was only 200 million francs, much less than in the corresponding period
in 1963. Increasing effectiveness of the stabilization program is seen
in the import decline, and also in the easing of labor market pressures:
from March to May the ratio of unfilled job vacancies to unemployed fell
from .6 to .5. After a further seasonal rise in food prices in May, the-over-
all index of retail prices was up only 0.5 per cent from January, compared
to 1.5 per cent from January to May in 1963.

IV -3
The Bank of Italy has kept a very tight rein on the money supply.
In the three months through April the money supply declined 1.1 per cent,
as against a 3.6 per cent rise the year before. Consumer prices continued
to rise through May, but the four-month increase from January was only
1.4 per cent, compared with 2.3 per cent last year. Wholesale prices of
nonagricultural products declined a little in April and May.
A new labor contract recently signed in the chemical industry
extends over two years. A pattern of much reduced increases in hourly
earnings could develop if escalation of minimum rates is checked by
stabilization of the cost of living, and if differences between actual
earnings and minimum rates become narrower than in the past.
The Italian balance of payments showed a surplus of about $100
million in June. Though this surplus was more than accounted for by an
exceptional inflow of long-term private capital, there has been an under-
lying shift from large deficits in the first quarter to near balance in
recent months, due primarily to the sharp reduction in imports.
To back up restraint of domestic credit expansion, the Bank of
Italy has directed banks not to increase their net foreign liabilities
beyond the level of either June 15 or June 30, whichever was lower.
The German economic situation remains strong, with capital
outlays by industry expected to rise further. Industrial production
rose in May, and for April/May averaged one-half per cent higher than in
February/March; the advance was mainly in output of materials. Total new
orders also averaged slightly higher in April/May than in the preceding

IV- 4
two months, despite declines in export orders and in total orders received
by nondurable consumer goods industries.
For the first time since the boom years of 1959 and 1960, the
Bundesbank in early July raised reserve requirements against domestic
deposits. Requirements were raised by one-tenth -- from 13.0 to 14.3
per cent for demand deposits at the largest banks. It was announced at
the same time that rediscount quotas will be cut for banks that increase
their borrowings abroad above recent average levels. The Bank also lowered
the cost of forward cover for banks placing funds in U.S. Treasury bills.
Although the increase in reserve requirements is expected to result in
some increase in interest rates by August, the inflow of foreign capital
will continue to be restrained by the proposed tax on nonresident incomes
from fixed-interest-bearing securities, and by the ban on interest payments
on foreign-held time deposits, as well as by the new sanction against
foreign borrowing by the banks.
The $236 million rise in official gold and foreign exchange
reserves in June reflected speculative inflows of foreign funds, as well
as mid-year repatriation of funds by German banks for window dressing.
The current account surplus has been large, but fairly stable, in recent
months.
British imports, after holding steady at a high level from
January to May, jumped sharply in June -- by 5 per cent. Exports, which
have been fluctuating widely, averaged 2 per cent higher in May/June than
in the preceding two months; they declined from May to June.

IV -5
Official gold and foreign exchange reserves fell by $56 million
in June, following gains in April and May that were largely attributable
to a payments surplus of overseas sterling countries with the nonsterling
world. Sterling weakened steadily in June, under pressure of repatriation
of funds by Continental commercial banks, and it has declined further
this month, to 278.85 cents on July 21.
A rise in Japanese exports, together with the leveling off
of imports, resulted in a narrowing of the trade deficit from an annual
rate of $2.1 billion in the first quarter of this year to $1.5 billion
in the second quarter. Industrial production continued steady in May,
although both exports and new orders for machinery have been rising.
To back up its tight money policy, the Bank of Japan in early
July put a new curb on inflows of volatile funds, limiting each bank's
liabilities for Euro-dollar money and free yen deposits to a percentage
of its foreign exchange assets.
Canadian imports were extraordinarily large in April. After
rising 18 per cent from the first quarter of 1963 to the first quarter of
this year, seasonally adjusted imports jumped nearly one-fifth further in
April. Industrial production rose to a new high in April, 36 per cent
above the 1957-59 average. Unemployment in April and May was 4.7 per
cent, substantially below the 5.6 per cent average for these two months
a year earlier.

Money market rates. Increases since March in money market
rates in various countries are shown in the table. In most cases, any
effects on U.S.capital flows would be expected to occur via increased
demands for Euro-dollar funds, for U.S. bank loans, and for direct invest-
ment financing of U.S. subsidiary companies, rather than through attraction
of U.S. nonbank liquid funds to foreign currency money markets. The
recentcourse of Euro-dollar interest rates is shown in a chart on p. IV-C-1.

APPENDIX A: ANNUAL REVISION OF NATIONAL INCOME AND PRODUCT ACCOUNTS
New GNP and national and personal income figures for the period
1961 to early 1964 were released by the Commerce Department on July 15, as
part of their regular annual revision. (Complete details will be in the July
Survey of Current Business.) As usual, changes in the over-all totals were
small as revisions in components were for the most part moderate and largely
offsetting.
This annual revision, like earlier ones, is based primarily on
routine adjustment of the original quarterly estimates to annual benchmarks
which become available after a considerable lag. In addition, a change has
been made in the quarterly estimating basis for Federal purchases of goods
and services, which is discussed below. This revision does not incorporate
the benchmark results of the 1958 censuses or the comprehensive revisions of
postwar residential construction series of recent years. These and other
important revisions, of both a statistical and conceptual nature, will be
incorporated in a comprehensive revision of the income and product accounts
for the entire postwar period which is likely to be completed by the end of
this year.
Gross national product. GNP in the first quarter this year was
revised upward only slightly, from $608 billion to $608.8 billion, and the
total increase from the recession low in early 1961 remains unchanged. (The
first quarter 1961 also was revised moderately upward and this makes the
already mild 1960-61 recession even milder.)
From quarter to quarter within the expansion period, the magnitude
of the upward revisions (which predominated) varied and a number of revisions
were downward. The result has been some modification of the quarterly
increases shown earlier and of the pace of expansion over certain periods.
Thus, the new GNP estimates show: (1) a somewhat larger rise in the third
quarter 1962; (2) an appreciably slower increase from the fall of 1962 through
the first half of 1963; and (3) faster increase from mid-1963 to early 1964.
Changes in real GNP were generally similar to those in GNP before deflation,
but, on balance, the revised GNP in 1954 dollars now shows a fractionally
larger increase for the entire expansion to date.
The table below shows the amount of revision in GNP (first column)
and the quarterly changes in the new GNP estimates (second column) as com-
pared with the former quarterly changes (third column).

Some comments are in order on the revisions of GNP components
shown in the above table:
1) The progressive--though moderate--upward revision of personal
consumption expenditures reflects increases for all three major consumer
categories, durable and nondurable goods and services, with roughly half of
the total reflecting an upping of service expenditures.
2) Underlying the small revisions in gross private fixed domestic
investment were generally offsetting increases in producers' durable equip-
ment and decreases in construction. The first quarter 1964 revision was
dominated by a rather large boost in producers' durable equipment to take
account of the results of the latest Commerce-SEC survey of fixed investment
outlays.
3) On a quarterly basis revisions in the inventory component were
rather large in the 1961-63 period, but these changes tended to (nearly) balance
out on an annual basis. In both 1962 and 1963, the amount of accumulation was
considerably lowered in the first half and raised in the second half. These
revisions are apparently based primarily on the comprehensive Census revision
of manufacturers' inventories released last December.
4) The pronounced reduction in government purchases of goods and
services, particularly for 1963 and early 1964, reflects mainly revision of
Federal outlays but also a downward adjustment in State and local outlays as
a result of routine adjustment to benchmark levels. The lowering of Federal
outlays stems from a combination of a shift to a Treasury checks-issued, from
a checks-posted, basis for estimating defense expenditures and an apparent
rather large revision which developed in the routine adjustment, as fuller
information became available, of the basic quarterly defense estimates to
allow for changes in net receivables of defense contractors.
National and personal income. Revisions in major income series
are shown below annually, 1961-63, and for the first quarter 1964.

A- 4
In the July 1963 revision incorporation of the effects of the
new depreciation guidelines (and the investment tax credit) resulted in a
substantial downward revision in corporate profits for the year 1962. In
the current revision an important part of that reduction was rescinded.
The upward adjustment in personal income, particularly beginning in 1963,
stems from small upward revisions in most major components except wages and
salaries which were not changed. With upward revision in personal consumption
expenditures and generally little change in disposable personal income,
personal savings were reduced moderately throughout the period. The saving
rate (saving as a per cent of disposable income) now averages 7.2 per cent
for the period affected instead of 7.5 per cent, and the spending rate is
correspondingly higher.
Federal surplus or deficit. The large downward revision in Federal
purchases of goods and services in 1963 and early 1964 has led to a marked
reduction in the size of the indicated Federal deficit (on GNP account): from
$2.8 to $1.5 billion in calendar 1963 and from a seasonally adjusted annual
rate of $5.3 billion to $2.4 billion in the first quarter of 1964.

B -1
APPENDIX B: CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY IN MID-1964
The recent leveling off of construction activity has raised the
question of whether a "cyclical" peak has been passed and whether a
decline in this key sector of activity is likely. This question has
been raised at least twice before since early 1961--in the first quarter
of 1962 and again in the first quarter of 1963. In those instances,
extremely unfavorable weather proved to be the major inhibiting factor.
Interpretation of the current data is made difficult by the
inherent volatility of most of the underlying series and the possibility
of major revisions by the Census Bureau. Only part of the results of a
recent major revision in back data have so far been completed. Despite
these sources of uncertainty the evidence seems strong that there already
has been some downward readjustment in the residential sector. Not only
was there a downturn in residential construction outlays during the
second quarter, but the rate of housing starts held appreciably below
its autumn high. More significantly, permit rates have tended sharply
downward. The shift has been notable for multifamily units, which
accounted for virtually all of the expansion after early 1961, and was
centered in the West, where the expansion had been most pronounced.
Nonresidential construction. In contrast, available data
suggest that there has been no significant over-all shift in seasonally
adjusted rates of private nonresidential and public building this year.
(Each of these broad groups accounts for three-tenths of total expenditures,
while private residential activity accounts for four-tenths.) Contracts
reported by F. W. Dodge in May fell below a year earlier for total
nonresidential, as well as residential activity, but they were still
unusually high and the backlog was sufficiently great to assure a high
level of all types of building throughout the year. Also, the May
Commerce--SEC survey of business plant and equipment investment indicated
such outlays would be 12 per cent higher than a year earlier compared
with a previous estimate of 10 per cent. Reports on advance planning from
Engineering News-Record and other sources also have been favorable to
sustained high levels.
The possibility of some downward adjustments in the seasonally
adjusted rate of nonresidential construction expenditures still cannot
be ruled out. Outlays for most nonresidential activities have been at
unusually high rates this year, and in most cases these rates have been
appreciably above levels initially projected for 1964, as can be seen
in the table which compares the Commerce forecast of year-to-year changes
released last December with the June figures. Most types of construction
moved substantially upward in the latter part of 1963. Less favorable
year-to-year comparisons in the second half year, therefore, may not
represent any drop from first half of 1964 rates on a seasonally adjusted
basis.

1/ Seasonally adjusted annual rate
Within the total there is considerable possibility of
offsetting movements in the private and public nonresidential sectors.
Increased strength, for example, in industrial and public utility
building could offset any weakening in office and shopping center
construction. In the final analysis, the major determinant of aggregate
construction activity this year, as in the past, is likely to be
the movement of residential activity.
Residential activity. Housing starts in the first half of
this year, were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.6 million,
including farm units. This rate reflected a drop from a first quarter
of 1.7 million to a second quarter rate of 1.5 million. Although the
first half was still 5 per cent above a year earlier, it was very near
the average for all of 1963. In 1963, seasonally adjusted starts rose
7 per cent from the first half to the second half. In the light of
this, the year-to-year comparison this fall is not expected to rise.
But, considering the backlog of unused permits and other factors, a
decline in the average rate for the rest of the year much below the
second quarter seems unlikely. This judgment is broadly consistent
with the results of an experimental survey, based on forecasts of housing
starts in 24 metropolitan areas, recently conducted by the National
Association of Home Builders.
Regionally, the decline has been clearly concentrated in the
West and Northeast states, with the South and especially the North
Central states running well above a year earlier. Nor has all of the
recent decline occurred in multifamily starts.

2 or more + 6 -4
Over the first six months of this year, multifamily starts
(2 or more) accounted for 37 per cent of total starts, compared with
36 per cent over the same period in 1963 and in June the proportion
was estimated at 34 per cent, just below a year earlier.
The longer-term outlook. The recent downturn in housing
starts and permits is of interest not only because of its implications
for the rest of this year but also for the period beyond. This,
after all, is the first postwar adjustment in which basic demand
forces have been the overriding influence, rather than availability of
mortgage money. Moreover, considering demographic conditions alone,
there is no basis for expecting an unusually high level of residential
activity for some time ahead. This factor, as well as the large stock
of building accumulated over the postwar period has led some observers
(especially those who emphasize the influence of the "long cycle")
to the view that construction activity is now particularly vulnerable
to a decline in general economic activity. So long as there is no
significantly unfavorable shift in general economic conditions, however,
the following considerations would appear to be of countervailing
importance:
First, there is nothing in the demographic pattern--
especially in a period of high and rising incomes--that suggests any
fundamental diminution in potential demands over the next few years
from the recent trend. Household formation has continued to run at
a level close to 1 million and probably will not change much over the
next few years. In addition, disappearance of existing structures
owing to scrappage and related influences apparently has been running
well in excess of 500,000. Consequently, annual starts of at least
1.5 million units--the second quarter rate--may well be sustainable.
Second, except for the more recent period, the average rate
of starts had not exceeded a 1.5 million average since the expansion
began in 1961. And the composition of starts has been roughly
consistent with growth in household formation which has been, and
will for several years continue to be, concentrated among the youngsters
and oldsters primarily in the market for apartments. Single family
starts have been unusually stable at about 1 million a year and well
below earlier highs in spite of the availability of mortgage money

B- 4
on very attractive terms. While the upsurge in multifamily starts,
which reached nearly 600,000 last year, has in slome cases apparently
involved "overbuilding," it also has involved a significant upgrading
of housing standards. Nationally, rental vacancy rates in the first
and second quarters of this year have continued below earlier peaks,
at 7.3 and 7.4 per cent of total units available and fit for use,
compared with highs of 8 and 8.1 per cent in the first two quarters
of 1961 when the further rise in apartment starts was already underway.
Meanwhile, rents have tended higher.
While the long lead-time required to bring new construction
to the market and other factors make short-term adjustments of supply
to demands difficult, it is apparent that some adjustments already
are going on. In New York, for example, where a change in zoning
regulations effective in late1961 induced an unsustainable volume
of permit and building activity in 1962, the decline began last year;
and this year there have also been downward adjustments in other
important areas, particularly in the West which dominated the expansion
last year. Most important, these shifts are coming at a time when
increases are occurring in some other areas, and providing an offsetting
element within the multifamily totals.
Third, the unprecedented availability of mortgage money,
unique for such an advanced stage of economic expansion, has continued,
and while savings inflows to deposit-type institutions have moderated
further in recent months, competition among lenders has remained
intense. As a result, even though mortgage debt expansion has continued
near a record high, interest rates have not risen and terms have eased
somewhat further.

As has been the case throughout the recent expansion in
mortgage lending, lenders have continued to rely on loans on existing
as well as on new construction to meet their portfolio requirements.
This reliance has tended to moderate the direct stimulus of ample funds
on new construction. At the same time, it has also provided continuing
support to housing demands and real estate values generally. Thus,

B -5
while foreclosures have risen, the rate of rise has slowed and, nationally,
there has been no indication that lenders have not been able to absorb
them.
The volume of activity sofar has not been associated with a
general depreciation in capital values. Land prices have continued to
rise and transaction prices of both new and used homes have increased.
While the special depreciation allowances and other tax advantages
introduced for income properties in 1954 were moderated somewhat in
early 1964, they still provide a substantial support to real estate
values. In this context, an April survey of real estate appraisers by
the Chase-Manhattan Bank is worth mentioning. According to this survey,
60 per cent of those sampled felt overbuilding of apartments was a
problem in their areas and over a third said office structures and
motels were overbuilt, but 74 per cent thought property values were
basically sound.
