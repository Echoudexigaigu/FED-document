IN BROAD REVIEW
Markets for stocks, bonds, foreign exchange, and sensitive
commodities showed remarkable resilience to the uncertainties created
by the flare-up in military action in the Far East last week. Latest
information indicates only small net changes in most of these markets
since before the crisis, but the daily figures for some sensitive
industrial materials, such as nonferrous metals and steel scrap, have
continued advances already underway.
Economic activity has been maintained on its steadily expansive
course. Recent search for developments of cyclical significance has
been stimulated in part by hesitation among some of the series regarded
as "leaders." Their behavior, however, has been too diverse to
warrant a change in earlier general expectations of continued moderate
growth in over-all activity.
Among the statistics recently becoming available, several
are of special interest. The sharp decline in the rate of unemployment
to below 5 per cent was not quite so favorable as it may have appeared
because it was associated with a decline in the labor force. Employment
rose moderately, but only to the April level according to the household
survey. Long-duration unemployment declined only a little below the
1 million level and not much below a year earlier.
Industrial production rose further in July, probably by about
1 point, extending the rise since last December to 4-1/2 per cent and
bringing the gain over a year earlier to 5-1/2 per cent. Increases
in July were widespread among industries and market groupings.

I- 2
Retail sales continued strong, rising by 1 per cent in July
from a June total which, however, has been revised downward to show
a decline of .5 per cent.
Private construction activity was little changed in July
at a level about 5 per cent above a year earlier. A dip in public
construction brought the total down slightly.
Business inventories rose in June and the amount of
accumulation in the second quarter was larger than estimated earlier.
The higher rate of inventory accumulation in the second quarter was
centered at distributors where sales also rose. Stock-sales ratios
generall continued quite low.
In financial markets, yields on Treasury, State and local,
and corporate bonds were all essentially unchanged in the past few
weeks but there has been some recent firming in 3-month Treasury bill
rates to about the level of the discount rate.
Hortgage rates and terms also have changed little. Stock
market prices have lost on net about 2-1/2 per cent since the beginnin
cf the recent crisis but remain 3 per cent above the June lows.
The money supply, which had increased substantially in June,
continued to rise in early July but fell back slightly in the latter
half of July. For July as a whole, the rise averaged $1.1 billion
and brought the annual rate of growth this year to 3.9 per cent. Time
and savings deposits rose $900 million further in July, a little less
rapidly than in May and June. The annual rate of growth so far this
year has been 10.8 per cent, considerably less than for the year 1963.
Free reserves rose somewhat in recent weeks while borrowings continued
about as they have in recent months.g

THE DOMESTIC ECONOMY
Industrial production. Available data indicate a further
increase of about 1 point in industrial production in July from the
June level of 132 per cent of the 1957-59 average. Gains in output
were widespread among consumer goods, business equipment, and materials.
Steel ingot production, which usually falls off about 10
per cent in July, declined only 4 per cent this year and was 17 per cent
above a year earlier. Output of crude petroleum and activity at
petroleum refineries changed about seasonally and paperboard production
continued at record levels.
The Board's monthly output indexes for fabricated metal
products and electrical and nonelectrical machinery are largely based
on employment data. Production worker manhours in those industries
showed gains of 1 to 2 per cent from June to July and average overtime
hours were above a year earlier.
The cutbacks in auto assemblies in preparation for the model
changeover have started earlier this year indicating a rather sharp
shift in the production pattern for July through September. However,
after allowance for the model changeover, and assuming settlement of
labor negotiations without strikes, current schedules for the third
quarter suggest that the seasonally adjusted auto index will increase
somewhat from the June level.
A sharp pick-up in dealer deliveries of new autos in the
final 10-days of July, reflecting partly the end of the trucking strike,
increased the total for the month. On a seasonally adjusted basis,

II -2
however, the July rate was 7.2 million, slightly below the June rate
of 7.4 million units and the same as a year earlier. Dealers'
stocks were reduced moderately in July and at 1-1/4 million were about
200,000 larger than a year earlier.
Sales of used cars were up moderately in July and stocks
were about the same as last year. Used car prices in the consumer price
index for June rose 1 per cent and were 4 per cent above a year earlier.
Unemployment and labor force. The rate of unemployment
declined sharply to 4.9 per cent in July, the lowest for the month
since 1957. This rate compares with a 5.3 per cent rate in June and
5.6 per cent a year ago. The July reduction reflected both a rise in
employment, following a decline in June, and some additional with-
drawals from the labor force.
The civilian labor force in July, seasonally adjusted, was
down 100,000 from June and nearly 400,000 from the high of 74.6
million reached in April and May. The July labor force was only 1.0
million above July 1963 whereas in other recent months the year-to-year
gains in the labor force were substantially larger, averaging 1.6
million for the second quarter. In view of the rising trend in
employment and production, the reduction in the labor force in July
was unexpected and may have been due to some measurement problem.
Unemployment rates among teenagers most of whom had been
looking for summer jobs, declined sharply between June and July and
there were also declines indicated for adults, both men and women.

II -3
Unemployment rates for all three groups also were below year-ago levels.
Most of the recent reduction was among persons with short-term
unemployment; the number of workers who had been unemployed 15 weeks
or more declined only moderately from the previous month and from a
year earlier.

As indicated in the table, total employment in July, according
to the Household Survey, was the same as in April and the decline in
unemployment mainly reflected a reduction in the labor force. The
developments since April have been in contrast to experience earlier
1/ Part of the decline in the labor force and unemployment
in July may have reflected the lateness of the survey week. The
reference week in the household sample is the week including the 12th
of the month. This year the 12th was a Sunday and the survey week was
the latest possible in a month--the week of the 12th-18th. In the
three preceding years, the July survey week was earlier than this.
The labor force and unemployment tend to decline rapidly from
week to week in July. Host summer workers enter the labor force in June
or early July and as summer progresses they either find jobs or give up
looking for work and leave the labor force. If this were the reason
for part of the decline in seasonally adjusted unemployment this July,
then the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate might rise in August.

II -4
in the year when there were substantial increases in both employment
and the labor force and a small decline in unemployment. In the
corresponding period last year, the employment increase, although
smaller, was fairly steady and accompanied by an equivalent increase
in the labor force and no change in unemployment.
Retail sales. According to the advance report, retail sales
in July were up 1.2 per cent from June, after allowance for the normal
seasonal variation. The July level was 1.4 per cent above the second
quarter average, suggesting a further sizable increase for personal
consumption expenditures in the third quarter.
Durable goods sales in July were up 2 per cent from their
moderately reduced June level. Sales at nondurable goods stores were
up about 1 per cent from June, continuing their steady advance of
other recent months.
The June figures, which had been previously reported as
maintaining the May level, have been revised downward and now show a
decline of .5 per cent. Downward revisions were shown for both
durable and nondurable goods.

Consumer credit. The expansion of consumer instalment debt
slowed markedly in June, the latest figures show. Increases continued
in every major category but were uniformly the smallest for any month
this year. The expansion fell from a $6 billion seasonally adjusted
annual rate in the first quarter to $5 billion in the second. The
second quarter rise in personal loans outstanding was the least for
any quarter since early 1963; the rise in nonauto sales credit, the
smallest since 1962.
While seasonally adjusted credit extensions were generally
lower in June than in May, the total for the spring quarter as a whole
was slightly higher than the January-March volume and were at a record
level. The brake on debt growth during the quarter resulted from
the increase in repayments. Moving up in the wake of the heavy borrowing
of February and March--and perhaps fueled from March on by the tax
cut--repayments on instalment credit in the second quarter were at a
seasonally adjusted annual rate above $60 billion for the first time.
Construction activity. Seasonally adjusted new construction
put in place dipped in July, according to preliminary estimates, but
the decline followed a 2 per cent upward revision for June which
brought the level back to about the record high reached in the spring.
The upward revision for June was all in public activity and the preliminary
July decline was also in that sector. In the private sector, residential
construction outlays in July remained at their moderately reduced late
spring rate. Business construction and most other types of nonresidential
activity edged higher.

Mortgage markets. Competition for residential mortgages
has continued strong this summer, though with scattered reports of
greater selectivity among certain borrowers and types of properties
than was the case last year. Contract interest rates on loans for
both new and existing homes have remained under doxmward pressure.
Loan-to-value ratios appear to have about stabilized while purchase
prices, loan amounts, and average maturities have continued to increase.

Delinquency rates on home mortgages declined again in the
second quarter, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association survey.
Rates of delinquency on FHA, VA, and conventional loans were nearly
all somewhat below year-earlier levels. Foreclosure rates, however,
were generally higher.
Business inventories. Seasonally adjusted book value of
business inventories increased in June and there was a sizable upward
revision for May. For the entire second quarter, business inventories
now show an increase of $875 million, as compared with a $600 million
increase in the first quarter.
The June increase and the larger accumulation for the quarter
as a whole resulted mainly from expansion at distributors. The second
quarter increase at distributors totaled over $800 million, double the
first quarter rate and as high as in the fourth quarter of 1963. However,
a large increase in sales accompanied the rise in inventories and
distributors' stock-sales ratios generally remained low.
In contrast with distributors, manufacturers' inventories
were reduced in June and the second quarter increase amounted to only
$50 million, below the already sharply reduced first quarter rate.
Nondurable goods inventories were down over $300 million in June and
for the second quarter as a whole. This unexpected decline was
associated with a 3 per cent rise in sales for the quarter--twice
as large an increase as had been anticipated by nondurable goods
producers in May. For durable goods producers, shipments in the

II -8
second quarter rose half as much as anticipated in May (1 instead of
2 per cent) and inventories increased as much as expected (about $400
million).
While unexpectedly large increases in sales appear to have
been one factor limiting the rise in manufacturers' inventories this
year, other factors include a decline in inventories in defense
industries, where shipments were relatively stable in the first half
and cutbacks were in prospect, and a decline in stocks at textile
mills which may be related to uncertainties connected with the
"one-price" cotton law.
Uith increases in inventories small and gains in sales large,
manufacturers' stock-sales ratios declined substantially in the first
half of the year. During 1963 and 1962 these ratios had been relatively
stable, which in itself was an unusually favorable development for
a cyclical expansion period.

Commodity prices. Although the official price indexes have
generally continued to exhibit little change, there recently has been
some revival of news comments suggesting the possibility of inflationary

II -9
developments. These have reflected strikes and upward pressures in the
nonferrous metal and steel scrap markets, statements by two major steel
companies that higher prices are needed, price advances in some other
markets, a continuing larger volume of new orders for most materials
and equipment than is usual in the summer months, and the impact of
foreign developments particularly in the Far East.
However, except mainly for metal products and some nondurable
goods, commodity markets have not shown cumulative upward movements
this year. Domestic supplies of goods have generally continued ample
and processing costs have been held down by continued gains in productivity.
In the copper market dealer prices in New York and London
have reached new peaks about 40 per cent above the major producers'
quotation and prices of copper and brass products have been raised
in recent weeks to cover the premium prices being paid for copper and
zinc. Some of these advances in product prices will be reflected in
the official price indexes but not the increases in premiums. Also,
tin prices have risen again to reach $1.65 per pound as compared to
$1.35 two months ago and $1.15 last year. Lead and zinc markets have
been eased by the Congressional authorization to release a certain
volume of supplies from the national stockpile.
Steel scrap at Chicago rose up to $7 per ton in early August
and the Iron Age composite is up $5 or 15 per cent over the past month.
Over the preceding year the increase had only been $7. Steel mills
have reported heavy demands for their products and in the case of steel
plate, which is used for heavy construction and railroad car building,

II -10
sales are on an allocation basis. Purchasing agents report this item
and five other materials, all metals, as being in short supply in July.
The BLS daily index of industrial materials, which is of
limited coverage, has risen 4 per cent since June and 2.6 per cent
since the end of July. The crisis in the Far East presumably was a
factor in the recent rise. This index also had risen 4 per cent in
April but subsequently lost part of that increase because of a temporary
decline in copper scrap and a 25 per cent drop in raw,cotton costs to
domestic mills as a result of the new Federal subsidy program and the
reduction in cotton farm support levels. Hill prices of cotton goods
showed relatively small declines and mill margins increased substantially.
Recently prices of some cotton and synthetic fabrics have been rising.
This has reflected partly the reduced level of manufacturers' inventories
in the textile-apparel industries and the strength in retail apparel
purchases which during recent months have been 12 per cent larger than
last year.
The consumer price index rose .2 per cent in mid-June and
was 1.3 per cent higher than a year ago. The latest rise reflected
mainly increases in foods and housing.

DOiESTIC FINANCIAL SITUATION
Bank credit. Seasonally adjusted loans and investments at
all commercial banks declined in July following substantial increases
in the two previous months. Heavy liquidation of U. S. Government
securities was mainly responsible for the drop, but other investments
(municipal and agency issues) and total loans also rose much less than
in earlier months of the year. The smaller loan rise resulted in large
part from reductions in security loans and in loans to finance companies.

Through July the annual rate of commercial bank credit growth
was 5.4 per cent, well below growth in the last five months of 1963 and
somewhat below expansion earlier in that year. Loans rose at an annual
rate of nearly 12 per cent--slightly above the 1963 expansion--but
liquidation of U. S. Government securities accelerated and purchases
of other securities moderated sharply.

III -2
In the first week of August, credit expanded sharply at weekly
reporting banks in leading cities; an increase of $1,300 million compared
with declines in the $100 -$1,200 million range in the corresponding
week of most other recent years. Holdings of U. S. Government securities
increased contraseasonally reflecting in part bank allotments of the $1
billion Treasury bill on August 4. Security loans and loans to finance
companies, which often decline, also rose.
Holdings of U. S. Government securities at all commercial banks,
after allowance for seasonal changes, declined $1.6 billion in July, the
fourth and largest consecutive monthly reduction in these holdings. De-
clines at city banks were concentrated around the mid-month and were
associated with substantial sales of short and intermediate term coupon
issues eligible in the advance refunding. In addition, heavy sales of
bills were made at depressed yield levels and bill holdings also declined
as a result of the July 15 maturity. Bill sales and redemptions were
offset only in part by moderate bank allotments of the $1 billion Treasury
bill on July 7 and the $1 billion bill strip on July 29.

III -3
On July 24, all commercial banks shifted about $5.5 billion
of issues maturing within 3 years into those maturing in over 5 years
through participation in the Treasury advance refunding. This represented
a somewhat larger transfer of securities into the long-term category than
had occurred in either the January 1964 or September 1963 advance refund-
ings.
Business loans at all commercial banks, seasonally adjusted,
increased 4300 million in July, a little below the average monthly in-
crease over the first half of the year. So far in 1964, growth has been
faster than in the corresponding months of 1963 but slower than in the
latter months of that year. At city banks, repayments in recent weeks
by metals and petroleum concerns have been heavier than usual although
borrowing in June had been relatively light. On the other hand, loans
to miscellaneous manufacturing and mining groups and to public utilities,
which frequently decline in July, have increased. Borrowing by the con-
struction industry has continued high. Purchases of bankers acceptances
have also been larger than usual.
Real estate and consumer loans rose further in July at about
the same rate as in other recent months. Growth in real estate lending,
however, has been somewhat smaller than in the corresponding months of
1963. Loans to nonbank financial institutions declined more than
seasonally in July following heavier-than-usual borrowing by sales finance
companies over the June tax and dividend period. Security loans also
dropped in July following two months of increase. Substantial borrowing
by U. S. Government security dealers associated with the advance refunding
and other Treasury financing was paid down somewhat by month-end, while
other security loans declined more than usual for this period.

III -4
Money supply and time deposits. The seasonally adjusted money
supply increased $1.1 billion further in July; unusually rapid expansion
in the first half of the month was followed by a small decline in the
second half. This brought the annual rate of growth since December to
3.9 per cent, about the same as in the second half of 1963. Taking the
past two months combined, the rapid growth in privately-held money supply
does not appear to have been associated with unusual changes in U. S.
Government deposits at commercial banks. While these deposits declined
more than usual in July, they had also increased more than usual in June.
Seasonally adjusted time and savings deposits at all commercial
banks increased $900 million in July, a little less rapidly than in May
and June. Growth was small in the first half of July, as it had been in
late June, but subsequently accelerated markedly. So far this year, these
deposits have increased at an annual rate of 10.8 per cent, 4 percentage
points below the 1963 expansion.
Bank reserves. Free reserves averaged $135 million over the
four weeks ending August 5; this was a little higher than in most other
recent months, mainly because of the unusually high $200 million figure
in the week of July 29. Over the period excess reserves at $400 million
were also a little higher than earlier but borrowings at $265 million
were about the same as the average of most other recent months. The
effective rate on Federal funds fell below 3-1/2 per cent on only two
days in the four week period. Some transactions, however, took place
below that rate on 10 days.

III -5
Seasonally adjusted reserves against private demand deposits
increased substantially over the four weeks ending August 5 with most of
the expansion in the final week. Reserves requited against U. S. Govern-
ment deposits dropped sharply as Treasury balances were drawn down in
July. Total required reserves, not adjusted for seasonal, declined $335
million, somewhat more than in the corresponding week of the two past
years.
Corporate and municipal bond narkets. Yields on both new
and outstanding issues of corporate and municipal securities have
continued stable in recent weeks. The most recent yield quotation for
new corporate bonds--for the week ending July 31--was the same as in
early July and 4 basis points below yields on comparable seasoned bonds.
Reported yields on outstanding issues have been substantially unchanged
since May. In the municipal market, yields have moved within a narrow
range over recent weeks and are now slightly above the recent lows
reached in mid-July.

The relative stability of yields has not reflected strong
investor demand. In fact, initial reception of closely priced issues has
been slow. But the recent supply of publicly offered corporate bonds
has been small and the calendar of prospective offerings is very light
through August, and unsold syndicate balances remain under $50 million.
Although yields thus far do not appear subject to immediate upward
pressure, the substantially heavier volume of offerings in prospect
after Labor Day, when a number of utility issues will be offered to
underwriters at competitive bidding, could bring a change in the
situation.

In the market for State and local securities, some pressure
on current yield levels is already in evidence. Recent new issue volume
has been comparatively high. Dealers' advertised inventories of unsold
securities have risen sharply since mid-July. They reached a level
above $700 million for the first time in more than a year and are
still in excess of $650 million. Although the volume of prospective
offerings between now and Labor Day is light, underwriters of some

III -7
recent issues which met an unfavorable response are already reported
to be offering price concessions. Unsold balances of the large New York
and California issues apparently are concentrated at the long end of
the maturity range.
Stock market. Common stock prices, which reached a new peak
in mid-July, declined 2-1/2 per cent to 81,76 on August 11 as measured
by Standard and Poor's composite index of 500 stocks. International
developments, and particularly the Vietnam crisis, appear to have
exerted a dominant influence in this movement, although some market
analysts thought the decline was partly the result of technical factors.
Sharpest reactions during the Asian crisis took place on moderate
trading volume and trading averaged less than 4.5 million shares daily
in each of the past three weeks. At current levels, prices remain
about 3 per cent above their June low.
U. S. Government finance. Treasury bond yields have changed
little since late July while Treasury bill rates have edged higher.
The Treasury's cash refinancing of maturing August issues proved
highly successful as subscriptions exceeding $14.0 billion were
received for the $4 billion offering of 18-month notes.

The recent impressive performance of the Treasury bond market,
which is still digesting the mammoth July advance refunding as well as
the Treasury's August refinancing, has continued in the face of
uncertainties created by the military crises in Southeast Asia and the
Eastern editerranean. Moreover, the market has been subjected to
growing press discussion of potential inflation in the domestic economy
and worsening in the international balance of payments. Against this
background, retail selling in the market has remained limited and has
been offset by net investor buying. This buying was supplemented in
the first week of August by System Account purchases of coupon issues
totaling $130 million, including about $85 million of bonds due in over
5 years. Dealer positions in these longer-term bonds were still a
substantial $916 million on August 10, down from $1,177 million on
July 16. The dealers have also built up sizable positions in shorter-term
coupon issues during the August refinancing. The dealers were allotted
about $430 million of the new 3-7/8 per cent notes of February 1966
and on August 10 they held $684 million of notes and bonds due in 1-5
years.
Treasury bill rates came under some upward pressure in late
July and early August, as the market absorbed bills from a $1 billion
bill strip auction on July 24 and a $1 billion auction of 1-year bills
on July 30. The 18-month notes offered in the August refinancing also
tended to compete for short-term funds. At the same time, market demand
for bills slackened while the return of a firm money market atmosphere
in early August made it somewhat more difficult for dealers to finance

III -9
their positions. Working to maintain upward pressure on short-term
rates in the weeks ahead will be the liquidation of short-term assets
by automobile companies during the period of production build-up
following model changeovers. Treasury plans to auction $1 to $1-1/2
billion of March tax bills later this month should also exert some
firming influence on Treasury bill rates.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
U.S. balance of payments. Preliminary data show a U.S.
payments deficit in July of slightly less than $600 million, and almost
as large as that recorded for the second quarter as a whole. The July
outturn would be affected by the substantial seasonal deterioration that
occurs between the second and third quarters. Also, these figures swing
widely from month to month; for example, in April a payments deficit
of $485 million was recorded to be followed in May by a deficit of only
about $40 million.
In June, according to preliminary figures, the outflow of short-
term capital totaled about $300 million, bringing the total for the second
quarter ($600 million) back to the high first quarter rate. Two-thirds of
the June outflow represented movements of liquid funds -- into dollar-
denominated time deposits, foreign currency money market assets, and also
U.S. banks' sterling deposit balances. The outflow of short-term bank
credit was up somewhat from the moderate level that had prevailed since
February.
Long-term bank loans in June remained at the low April/May rate.
New foreign securities issues totaled $50 million, down sharply from the
April/May rate of more than $100 million a month.
Both total exports and imports declined somewhat in June,
leaving the trade surplus unchanged at nearly a $6 billion annual rate,
about $1 billion lower than in the first quarter.
Business and financial developments abroad. Continuation of
recent trends in foreign economic activity is indicated by the latest

IV -2
information. In France and Italy, there is evidence of further reactions
to government stabilization efforts. British and Japanese reserves de-
clined further in July.
French labor market pressures are continuing to ease. The
ratio of unfilled job vacancies to unemployed declined further during
June to 0.47 from 0.50 at the end of May. One automobile manufacturer
recently cut the average work week in its plants, and Renault -- the
largest producer -- has announced a substantial reduction in working hours
to take effect on 31st August. Automobile production in April-June was no
higher than a year earlier. Total industrial production fell back slightly
in May, -- perhaps reflecting an unusual incidence of holidays -- and was
equal to the January-April average. On the other hand, prices have con-
tinued to move upwards with a further moderate rise in retail prices and
a much less than seasonal decline in wholesale prices in June.
Official external reserves rose by $67 million in July follow-
ing accruals of $293 million in the second quarter. The trade deficit in
May-June was about the same as the average for the two preceding months.
Imports, though down from the peak reached early in the year, have shown
little net change recently.
Industrial production in Italy is reported to have declined in
May, bringing the reduction in output since last December to a little
more than 2 per cent. Wholesale prices were unchanged in June. The
balance of payments surplus in June has now been revised upwards to total
$154 million. Latest trade figures for May show imports remaining at the
reduced level of March-April.

IV -3
The new Italian Government has announced a program for tighter
control over Government expenditures. The rise in expenditures is to
be much smaller than in recent years, and together with selected tax
rate increases this is expected to reduce the budget deficit. On the
other hand, tax incentives and other measures are to be proposed to
mitigate some of the effects of the tight money policy on private investment.
Japanese reserves fell by $22 million in July. On August 1st,
the Bank of Japan raised the percentage of liquid foreign exchange assets
that banks must maintain as reserves against their short-term foreign
liabilities. This measure supplements the quantitative limits placed
early in July on short-term foreign liabilities in the form of Euro-dollars
and free yen deposits.
Japanese industrial production rose 2.5 per cent in June, after
having shown no net increase from February to May.
British reserves fell by $28 million in July following a decrease
of $56 million in June. Sterling has remained under intermittent pressure
over the last three weeks and the spot rate has remained at about 278.85
cents.
Some easing of British labor market pressures is indicated by a
small rise in unemployment and fall in job vacancies in July. Industrial
production in May remained unchanged from the level of the preceding
four months. But latest data on orders in engineering industries continue
to indicate expanding domestic investment demand. The sharp rise in imports
in June reflected a continuing rise in imports of semi-manufactures and
finished manufactures, together with a new pickup in imports of basic
materials.

IV -4
For Germany, recent information continues to indicate a strong
demand situation. The unemployment rate declined to 0.5 per cent in
June and the number of job vacancies rose further. Industrial production,
though down in June, averaged nearly 2 per cent higher in May-June than
in the preceding two months. Total new industrial orders in May-June
averaged 3 per cent below the very high levels of the preceding four months:
export orders declined further and total orders for basic materials and
nondurable consumer goods fell back; however, new orders are still rising
in the investment goods industries, and order backlogs in these industries
have lengthened further.
Canadian economic indicators for May were less buoyant than
in earlier months. Industrial production, employment, and building permits
showed declines. Employment fell further in June for the third consecutive
month, and the unemployment rate jumped to 5.2 per cent from the 4.7 per
cent rate of April/May.
However, exports rose further in May and very sharply in June.
Retail trade also picked up in May after falling off slightly in the two
preceding months. Capital spending intentions for 1964 have been
revised upwards by about 7 per cent, according to a recent survey; in the
business sector, anticipated capital expenditures were up 10 per cent
from six months ago, but for residential construction and government
capital outlays the revisions are smaller. The prospective volume of
investment expenditures may encounter supply shortages and other bottle-
necks, but, if realized, total capital spending would be 16 per cent
higher than in 1963.

APPENDIX A: SECOND QUARTER pORgR0P E PROFITS
Corporate profits before taxes, according to our present
estimates, were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $57 billion in
the second quarter of 1964. While this is a new peak, and 12 per cent
above the level in the second quarter of last year, it represents
very little further rise from the surprisingly high level now shown
for the first quarter of this year. Profits of companies in non-
manufacturing industries are estimated to have risen further, after
seasonal adjustment, from the first to the second quarter, but
manufacturing earnings appear to have increased no more than, and
probably less than, seasonally.
Second quarter earnings reports are now available for about
600 manufacturing companies that account for two-thirds of all manu-
facturing corporate profits. These reports indicate a year-to-year
increase of 14 per cent in profits after taxes of all manufacturing
corporations. Part of the rise reflects the cut in Federal income tax
rates this year. On a before-tax basis, manufacturing profits are
estimated to have increased 11 per cent from second quarter to second
quarter, with all major industries except iron and steel participating
in the rise.
In the first quarter of 1964 the year-to-year increase in
profits of manufacturing companies had been much larger: 27 per cent
for profits after taxes and 22 per cent for profits before taxes.
However, the second quarter shrinkage in the rate of year-to-year
gain, which occurred to some extent in almost all manufacturing
industries, reflected in part the sluggishness of profits in the
first quarter of last year and the subsequent marked rise in the
second quarter.
The fact that our present estimates indicate a decline in
seasonally adjusted manufacturing profits from the first to the second
quarter of this year, and almost no rise in total corporate profits,
does not necessarily mean that the peaking-out in profits that usually
occurs after a year or so of expansion in economic activity has at
last arrived. It may represent only another of the pauses which,
as may be seen from the table, have marked the generally upward course
of profits since 1961.
On the other hand, the failure of profits to rise much may
reflect lack of comparability between our estimates for the second
quarter and the official estimates for the first. We do not have
all the information we would need to estimate the corporate profits
series exactly as Commerce estimates it, but such information as
we have yields a significantly ($1 billion or so) lower figure for
the first quarter of this year than the official estimate for this

A -2
1/
period. We do not know at present whether this difference reflects
some special adjustment or, if so, whether it could be expected to
affect the second quarter as well. Using our estimates for both the
first and second quarters gives a relatively smooth upward movement
in profits before taxes since the fourth quarter of last year.

1/ In particular, as may be seen from the table, the official estimate
of profits for nondurable goods manufacturers shows a sharp increase
from the fourth quarter to a level 20 per cent above the first
quarter of 1963. The FTC-SEC series (the extrapolating series used
in deriving the manufacturing component) shows for nondurable goods
groups a year-to-year increase of 15 per cent, and of only 12 per
cent when the FTC-SEC data are converted to the National Income

APPENDIX B: EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY ACT OF 1964
The President's program to combat poverty through: educational
and vocational training of young persons in low income families; com-
munity action programs; job training for recipients of aid to dependent
children; adult education programs; assistance to families of migrant
workers; grants and loans to small farmers; and loans to small businesses
was passed August 11, substantially as proposed (see FOMC Notes of
3/20/64). The Act authorizes expenditure of $947.5 million for operation
of the program in fiscal 1965. An expenditure of $962.5 million was
included in the 1965 budget. The funds are divided as follows:
Authorizations
for Fiscal 1965
Programs (in millions)
Job Corps $190.0
Community Service 315.0
Work-training (high school students) 150.0
Work-study (college students) 72.5
Adult Education 25.0
Work-experience (public assistance
recipients) 150.0
Aid to Rural Areas 35.0
Administration and volunteer workers 10.0
Total $947.5
Of the $315 million authorized for community action programs,
the $189 million to be allotted to State projects will be divided into
three equal parts and a State's share of each third is based on its
relative position with respect to: (1) the number of public assistance
recipients, (2) average unemployment, and (3) the number of children
under 18 living in families with incomes of less than $1,000. A similar
method will be used to distribute the $72.5 million appropriation to
provide job opportunities for college students from low income families.
The criteria for a State's share are based on: (1) the number of full-
time college students, (2) the number of high school graduates, and (3) the
number of children in families with incomes under $3,000.
