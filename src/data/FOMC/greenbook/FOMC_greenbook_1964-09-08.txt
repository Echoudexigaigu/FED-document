IN BROAD REVIEU_
Limited preliminary reports for August, additional information
concerning July, and various reports on consumer and business plans
indicate that the e::pansion under way since the spring of 1961 is being
extended into the autumn of 1964. Except in residential building,
activity recently has been running higher than a year ago by amounts
such as 6 or 7 per cent for retail trade, 11 der cent in plant and
equipment outlays, and 7 per cent in gross national product, re-
flecting for the most part real gains. Industrial production has
risen every month since last November and is 5 or 6 per cent above a
year ago. Unemployment, slow to respond, in the east year has declined
from the 5-1/2 to 6 per cent level that prevailed so long to a level
of around 5 per cent, and there has been some increase in use of available
plant and equipment.
So far in this long expansion period, gains in activity and
employment have been achieved without stimulating much accumulation of
inventories or generating either widespread price advances for goods
or many advances in wage rates in e;:cess of continuing increases in
productivity. Prices for nonferrous metals have shown persistent
strength over the past year and a half and testing of markets has resulted
in higher quotations for some other commodities, but there have also
been some price declines and the broad index:es have continued to show
relatively little change.
In the bond markets, the recent tendency has been toward a
somewhat heavier tone, as both dealers and investors appear to have
turned more cautious. Yields on both longer-term Treasury bonds and new

I -2
corporate issues have risen several basis points since mid-August,
while municipal dealers are reported to have made frequent small price
concessions to move older inventories. The Treasury bill market, in
contrast, has continued firm vith the yield on 3-month bills continuing
at around the 3.50 per cent level.
The money supply rose further in August. For the first
8 months, the rise has been at an annual rate of about 4 per cent,
about the same as in the latter part of 1963.
Bank credit appears to have risen sharply in August,
following the moderate July decline. In part this reflected bank
absorption of Treasury cash financing, but loan expansion also was
vigorous.
The U.S. balance of payments deficit was again very large
in August, according to preliminary indications. Imports rose sharply
in July, fully offsetting the small June dip.
Abroad, sterling has weakened further in exchange markets
and British reserves showed a large decline in August. Payments
positions have continued to improve in Italy and Japan, and remained
strong in France.
Selected domestic economic developments:
-Retail sales continued to rise in August and
consumer buying plans reported for new autos and
household durable goods were substantially above
a year ago.
-- Expansion in consumer instalment credit accelerated
in July after slowing in June.
-- Housing starts and permits declined more than
seasonally in July.

I -3
-- New orders for durable goods rose sharply in July;
much of the rise reflected a temporary bulge in
defense orders.
-Inventory accumulation at factories continued at
a very slow pace in July and inventory-sales
ratios declined further.
-- In late August a farmers' strike curtailed marketings
of livestock temporarily, raising prices and
accounting in large part for a rise of 1/2 per cent
in the weekly wholesale price index. The index
for industrial products remained stable.

THE DOMESTIC ECONOMY
Prices. The wholesale commodity price index, as indicated
by weekly estimates, rose 1/2 per cent in late August when prices of
livestock and meats increased 5 to 10 per cent because of a farmers'
strike. The striking group's objective in curtailing market supplies
is to obtain packers' agreement to minimum prices for livestock. A
similar withholding movement in 1962 failed after about two weeks.
The index of industrial commodity prices in August was
unchanged from July and also unchanged from last December. Supplies.
of industrial materials, with the important exception of nonferrous
metals, appear to be readily available and average prices of materials
remain stable. While attention is drawn to the labor-contract
negotiations in the auto industry for indications of future develop-
ments, labor costs in manufacturing so far have continued to show
little change. With neither labor costs nor materials' costs
generally rising, average wholesale prices of finished industrial
products have been stable; they have not changed significantly
since business activity turned up in early 1961.
In the metal markets, copper demands continue strong and
supplies continue to be limited by strikes here and abroad. Major
producers raised prices (2 cents to 32-1/2 cents a pound) for foreign
delivery, and it is widely expected that domestic prices will be
raised after the strikes are settled. For lead and zinc, increases
in foreign prices generated pressures to raise domestic quotations
despite recent sales from the U.S. stockpile and expansion in world

II -2
production. A major domestic producer of lead raised prices (1 cent
to 14 cents per pound) in mid-August, and other iroducers followed at
the month's end. Most recently, prices of lead and zinc abroad have
eased somewhat. Tin prices have risen sharply further although weekly
sales from the stockpile have been large. Steel scrap prices increased
appreciably in late July as steel production showed less summer decline
than had been expected. Buying of scrap was curtailed as prices rose,
however, and in late August prices declined half way back to the July
level. These metals, included as 5 of the 13 materials in the BLS
daily index of raw industrials, largely accounted for the rise of
about 5 per cent in that index from mid-June to mid-August.
The consumer price index rose .3 per cent in July, mainly
because of an increase of nearly 1 per cent in foods. Retail prices
of meats, which often reach a seasonal peak in July, rose more than 2
per cent. Prices of nonfood commodities were unchanged and those of
services continued to rise at an annual rate of about 2 per cent.
The total index was 1.1 per cent higher than in July of last year.
Industrial production. Available output data for August,
while meager, indicate a continued high level of industrial production
with the possibility of a further rise. Auto and truck assemblies,
after allowance for the model changeover shutdowns, continued at
record rates. Output of crude petroleum and activity at petroleum
refineries changed about seasonally and paperboard production increased
to record levels. Steel ingot production, which showed much less

II -3
than the usual seasonal decline in July, rose less than usual in
August despite continuing heavy demand for a wide range of steel
products.
In July, industrial production increased for the eighth
consecutive month to a level 28 per cent above the low in early
1961 and 33 per cent above the 1957-59 average. In July, as shown
in the table, the broadest market groups--consumer goods, equipment
(business and defense), and materials--were all about the same
amount above the average for 1957-59, a period that included two
relatively prosperous years and one recession year. Business equip-
ment, however, was at a relatively higher rate reflecting chiefly
an advance of 9 per cent over the past year at a time when consumer
goods output was rising 5 per cent and materials output 6 per cent.
The broad industry divisions have shown more diverse changes
from 1957-59 levels, reflecting in the main long-time trends toward
sharply higher levels of output at electric and gas utilities and
relatively little higher levels at mines. In manufacturing, output of
durable goods is up about as much as output of nondurable goods.

Auto neotiations. The United Auto Workers Union turned down
offers made recently by the three major producerd but arranged to extend
existing contracts from August 31 to September 9. The union has also
offered to extend its contracts with Ford and General Motors beyond
September 9 on a day-to-day basis while negotiating with the Chrysler
Corporation, selected as the target company for concentrated negotiations
and possible strike.
The head of the union has estimated that the contracts proposed
by the companies were worth about 35 cents an hour over a three-year period,
excluding cost-of-living allowances. This would imply an annual increase
of about 3 per cent a year based on estimated hourly earnings including
fringes of $3.80 per hour. The auto companies have not made public any
estimate of the additional costs. The three-year package negotiated in
1961 was estimated at about 30 cents an hour.
The company offers included a continuation of the 2.5 per cent
annual improvement factor (this same rate of rise in hourly earnings has
been in the auto contracts since 1955) and substitution of an annual
cost-of-living allowance for the current quarterly adjustment. In addi-
tion, the offers included higher pension benefits, incentives to encourage
earlier retirement, fully paid life insurance, more vacations for some
workers and higher supplementary unemployment benefits. The companies
apparently have made no offer to increase relief time for assembly workers,
one of the major demands made by the union.

II -5
Construction activity. In July, private housing starts declined
more than seasonally, lowering the annual rate to slightly less than the
April-May level. Residential building permits also declined in July.
Based on three-month moving averages, both starts and permits in the May-
July period were running about 10 per cent below last fall's highs. On
the other hand, the F. U. Dodge index of construction contracts--covering
all types of work--held steady in July for the fourth consecutive month,
and was not far below earlier highs.

Home mortgage markets. In July, mortgage market conditions
continued to show little change, but there were additional reports of
somewhat less ease in certain areas. Secondary market yields on certain
FHA-insured 30-year home loans--at 5.46 per cent--were virtually unchanged
from levels prevailing for more than a year, and secondary market opera-
tions of the Federal National Mortgage Association remained small.
Several provisions of the Housing Act of 1964 now on the
President's desk would have a direct effect on home mortgage markets,
as noted in Appendix B. One other recent development which may also
affect mortgage markets is the August 19 action of the Federal Home Loan

II -6
Bank Board, approving a general policy statement on advances by the 12
regional Federal Home Loan Banks to member institutions. The statement
recommends that credit lines for expansion purposes be progressively re-
duced for institutions with unduly weak portfolios or lending practices.
Outstanding advances totaled $4.7 billion toward the end of August,
compared with $3.8 billion a year earlier.
Consumer spending. Another large increase in consumer spending
is indicated for the third quarter. Retail sales in August appear to be
up somewhat from the record July level, as sales at nondurable goods stores
have continued their steady upward pace of the past nine months and sales
at durable goods stores have risen slightly. For July and August total
sales appear to have been about 2 per cent above the second quarter monthly
average. Meanwhile, personal income in July rose only $1.5 billion, annual
rate. Thus there is some indication that the saving rate, which jumped in
the second quarter after the tax cut, is likely to show some decline in the
third quarter, as was projected in the GNP model underlying the Budget
message.
Sales of new domestic autos increased in the second ten days of
August, continuing to reflect the strengthening influence of the end of the
trucking strike. For the first twenty days, sales were at the month-ago
level although they usually decline from July to August. The seasonally
adjusted annual rate for the two months of July and August taken together
apparently was about 7.7 million, the same as for the whole 1964 model year.
Stocks continued to decline but at 925,000 units were 14 per cent above
last year. Sales of used cars also increased in mid-August and for the
first twenty days were 2 per cent above a year earlier.

II -7
Prospects for continued expansion in consumer spending appear
good. In particular, according to the most recent Census quarterly survey
of buying intentions, plans to buy new autos and household durable goods
are up considerably from a year ago.
New car buying plans this year appear co have continued the
upward trend that was evident last year. As shown in the table below,
plans to buy a new auto increased about as much from January to July as
they did last year and held a 7 to 10 per cent gain over last year's
level. Just as last year's rise in future buying plans may have been a
harbinger of this year's rise in auto sales, this year's rise in plans
may suggest some further increase in auto sales--or, at the least, a
sustained record volume of sales--over the coming 12 months. Twelve-
month used car buying plans in July, however, were somewhat below a year
earlier and the lowest for the month since 1960.

July survey 8.4 9.0 7

* October usually shows a large seasonal rise associated
with the introduction of new models.
Demands for household durable goods have also been signifi-
cantly above year-earlier levels: the proportion of households reporting
intentions to buy any of 7 major household durable items in the next six
months has averaged 17 per cent this year as compared with 16.3 per cent
in the first three surveys last year and in the July survey alone the
margin was wide, 17.1 per cent as against 16.0.

II -8
Plans to buy either a new or previously occupied house within
12 months, as reported in mid-July, were about unchanged from earlier
this year. They were somewhat less numerous, however, than in July
1963.
Consumer credit. Demands for consumer credit were strong
again in July, following a marked slowdown in June. The rise in
instalment debt--nearly $500 million--was about the same as the average
for the year to date. Noninstalment credit was up nearly $200 million
in July.
The tempo quickened for virtually all types of loans and
for most lender groups, with an especially sharp pickup in non-
automotive consumer goods paper. Automotive credit showed only a
modest increase. Among the major lender groups, the July gain was
greatest at retail establishments. At sales finance gompanies, by
contrast, the rise in instalment credit in July was a little less
than in June.
Manufacturers' capital appropriations. Capital appropriations
of the thousand largest U. S. manufacturing companies rose a fifth
from the first to the second quarter, according to the National
Industrial Conference Board survey, but preliminary estimates indicate
only a small further increase in the third quarter. (This is the
first survey in which the NICB asked respondents to include estimates
of appropriations for the current quarter.) The second quarter rise
followed two quarters of little change after a moderately large rise
in the third quarter of last year.

II -9
The advance in new capital appropriations since last winter
appears broadly consistent with the rise in outlays for plant and
equipment indicated for the balance of this year by the Commerce-
SEC i'iay survey. (Results of the August survey, to be available
shortly, will be included in the Supplement if possible.)
Business inventories. Despite continuing increases in sales
in retail and wholesale markets, businessmen have not displayed much
eagerness to add significantly to their stocks. Manufacturers' inventory
investment in July continued at the slack pace of other recent months.
Book value, seasonally adjusted, increased only $50 million, following
a rise of only $70 million for the entire second quarter. Manu-
facturers' sales, which had declined moderately in June, showed a
large gain in July to a new record level and stock-sales ratios for
both durable and nondurable goods declined appreciably to new lows
for this expansion period.
The small rise in inventories in July was at durable goods
producers and reflected a gain in work-in-process stocks which more
than offset declines in materials and finished goods. Nondurable
goods inventories were unchanged in July at a level below the end
of lay by more than $300 million.
In the first seven months of this year, the book value of
manufacturers' inventories increased only about $300 million, as
compared with a rise of $1.1 billion in the corresponding period of
1963. As indicated in the table below, defense products industries
accounted for a large part of the over-all difference between the two

II -10
periods. This year defense inventories have been declining, whereas
in 1963 they were rising. For the durable goods sector excluding
defense, total accumulation has been the same this year as last
athough this year's accumulation has not included a build-up in steel
stocks such as occurred in 1963. The decline in textile stocks this
year has apparently largely reflected the repercussions of the "one-price"
cotton law enacted in the spring. There is little reason to expect
much further decline in textile stocks, but--with defense cutbacks
in prospect--inventories in defense industries may well decline further.

With distributors' inventories rising more than they did in
the first half of 1963, accumulation of business inventories at all
levels was at about the same moderate rate prevailing in the first
half of last year. The rise in distributors' inventories this year
has been less r apid than the advance in sales and stock-sales ratios
have declined somewhat.

Orders for durable goods. New orders received by manufacturers
of durable goods, seasonally adjusted, increased 7 per cent to a new
peak in July reflecting in large part an unexpected rise in defense
orders. As is shown in the chart, new orders for civilian products
increased 2 per cent, recovering to about the April high. Machinery
and equipment orders in July were close to the record iay-June level
and 6.5 per cent above April; for all other civilian products
combined the July level was up from June but moderately below April.
The July increase brought the rise in new orders since
December to 19 per cent Shipments also increased substantially over
that period--7 per cent--but the new order level exceeded shipments
in each month, and the value of unfilled orders increased 10 per cent.
This increase in the order backlog in this seven-month period was about
as large as the net gain from the cyclical low in early 1961 to the
end of 1963.
The table below shows the gains in new orders, shipments,
and unfilled orders for key durable goods sectors since December. The
extraordinary rise in new orders shown for defense products is not
representative of trends in that sector: the level was unusually low
in December and exceptionally ( and temporarily) high in July. However,
throughout the period new defense orders generally exceeded shipments
and the order backlog rose percentagewise as much as unfilled orders
for civilian products. Uithin the civilian sector, the rise in
order backlogs was largely concentrated in producers' equipment and
primary metals.

While order backlogs for durable manufacturers have generally
shown impressive gains this year, the increases for the entire cyclical
upsuing to date remain well below dollar gains in the 1954-56
expansion when prices, as well as physical volume, were rising and
capacity limitations were operative. In real terms, the increase
this time may be nearly as large as in the earlier period. The table

Farm land values. The long-term uptrend in land values is
persisting. A rise of 6 per cent in the year ending Harch 1 this year,
following a rise of 4 per cent in the preceding year, brought the
national index of value per acre to 131 (1957-59=100). Preliminary
figures indicate a further rise of 3 per cent from Narch 1 to July 1,
the same as a year ago. Rising values were reported in all areas,
with the Southern tier of states continuing to outpace the rest of
the country: the increase there since 1957-59 is now more than 50
per cent. Among the factors contributing to the strong real estate
market were the continued demand for land for farm enlargement and
the current ready availability of mortgage money.
Agricultural income. Net income realized by farmers in the
first half of 1964, at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $12.3
billion, was don about iper cent from a year earlier as rising
production expenses narrowed margins. Gross income was somewhat
higher than a year earlier. Cash receipts from crops, poultry products,
and milk were up while receipts from cattle were down as price decreases
more than offset marked increased in the volume of marketings.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL SITUATION
Bank credit. Loans and investments atlcity banks rose nearly
$2 billion over the three weeks ending August 19 in contrast with much
smaller increases or moderate declines in the corresponding weeks of
other recent years. In addition, credit rose a little more than usual
at banks outside leading cities in the first half of August. Thus,
even after allowance for the large credit decline in the last week of
the month, seasonally adjusted loans and investments at all commercial
banks probably will show a large rise in August, possibly around $4
billion, folloving a moderate decline in July.

The contra-seasonal rise in holdings of U. S. Government
securities at city banks in August reflected in part the unusual pattern
of Treasury financing operations this summer. In the absence of the
usual large cash financing in July, banks were not in a position to make
secondary distribution sales of Governments in August as they did in

III -2
most other recent years. Rather, after reducing holdings of Governments
at the time of the July advance refunding, banks were active participants
in the two August financings. All commercial banks were allotted about
$600 million of the $1 billion Treasury bills on August 4--somewhat more
than in similar financings in past months--and about $1.2 billion of the
$4 billion 3-7/8 per cent 18-month notes on August 17, about $400
million more than their holdings of the maturing issues.
A major factor in the large loan expansion over the period
was the $420 million increase in business loans, more than half again
as much as in the comparable weeks of any of the past three years.
The seasonally adjusted rise for the month of August at all commercial
banks is estimated at $500 million, about the same as the accelerated rate
of the previous four months. For the year to date, the annual rate of
growth has been about 8 per cent compared with about 9 per cent over
the year 1963.
Loans to metals companies, the construction industry
and trade concerns increased more than usual in the first three weeks
of August and loans to public utilities, which usually decline in this
period, also rose. In addition, "unclassified" business loans,
representing principally loans made by the smaller weekly reporting
banks not reporting the industrial breakdowns, have been larger than
in corresponding weeks of other recent years. On the other hand, loans
to textile and apparel manufacturers, petroleum and chemical companies,
and to commodity dealers have been shouing less strength than usual.

III -3
Another major factor in the large loan rise in the first
three weeks of August was the unusually heavy borrowing by nonbank
financial institutions, particularly finance companies. Security loans,
which normally decline in this period, also rose, associated in part
with the early and mid-month Treasury financings. In the subsequent
week of August 26, however, both security loans and loans to finance
companies declined substantially at city banks. Real estate and
other loans continued to expand in August.
Money supply and time deposits. The seasonally adjusted
money supply (preliminary estimate) increased $600 million further in
August, somewhat less than the $1.1 billion increases in each of the
two previous months. Through August, growth this year was at an annual
rate of 4 per cent, about the same as in the last half of 1963. U. S.
Government deposits declined $700 million in August, somewhat more
than usual.
Seasonally adjusted time and savings deposits at all commercial
banks (preliminary estimate) increased $1.2 billion further in August,
somewhat more than in any other month since the late winter. Through
August, growth was at an annual rate of 11.1 per cent, considerably
below the 14.8 per cent expansion in 1963.
Over the three weeks ending August 19, savings deposits at
city banks increased $200 million, a third more than in the corresponding
weeks last year. Through July, such deposits had increased only
about three-fifths as much as in the first seven months of 1963. Other
time deposits, however, increased only slightly further over the first

III -4
three weeks of August. In the comparable period last year, these
deposits, particularly CD's, had increased sharply after interest rates
paid on time deposits had been raised in mid-July. At banks outside
leading cities, grouth in total time and savings deposits rose sub-
stantially in the first half of August, although somewhat less than
in the comparable period of 1963.
Bank reserves. Free reserves of member banks averaged $95
million over the four weeks ending August 26, a little below the $110
million average of the previous six months. Excess reserves averaged
$405 million and borrowings, $310 million, both a little higher than
earlier prevailing levels. The effective rate on Federal funds remained
at 3-1/2 per cent over the entire four-week period, though some
transactions took place slightly below that rate on four days.
Total required reserves, not seasonally adjusted, increased
$215 million between the weeks of July 29 and August 26; in the
corresponding weeks of most other recent years required reserves had
declined. Reserves required against private demand deposits declinec
less than usual and those against U. S. Government deposits rose more
than usual from temporarily low end-of-July levels.

Corporate and municipal bond markets. The tone of the market
for corporate bonds appears to have weakened a little recently. The
yield series on new issues has edged higher, and yields on several
recently offered utility bonds released from syndicate have advanced
in secondary trading.
The recent highlight of the municipal bond market was the
excellent reception accorded last week's large negotiated offerings of
$314 million Columbia Storage Power Exchange Bonds and $38 million
Massachusetts Turnpike Bonds. Reflecting theirrelatively high yields
joth of these issues sold out quickly and moved to attractive premiums
in secondary trading. Heavy over-subscriptions for the Columbia
Storage issue in particular--reportedly coming in part from investors
not generally active in the municipal market--necessitated a partial
allotment of requested orders. But there has been no evidence as yet
of a pickup in demand for other municipal bonds. In fact, dealers
have reportedly had to make small price concessions throughout the
month in order to distribute their advertised inventories, although
yields on seasoned bonds have remained unchanged.

The more cautious tone recently evident in the corporate bond
market is probably mainly a reflection of the larger calendar of new
offerings scheduled for September. To a limited extent, however, it
may also reflect the continuing overhang of Treasury coupon issues
involved in recent Treasury refinancing activities as well as the
more general reviewing of underlying conditions that has been evident
in the Treasury bond market during the past two weeks. While the volume
of corporate bonds currently slated for public offering in September
is no larger than the average monthly supply brought to market earlier
this year, it is substantially above the seasonally low July-August
volume and includes a larger than usual number of utility bonds to
be offered for competitive bidding.

Municipal dealers' began the month of August holding a near-
record inventory of $725 million. With August new issue volume seasonally
low (particularly if one excludes the Columbia Storage issue because of

III -7
its general appeal to other types of investors), dealers succeeded
in cutting their advertised inventories by about $100 million during
the month. The September calendar of municipal offerings has expanded
recently to an estimated $900 million, roughly twice the volume of
September a year ago.
Stock market. Common stock prices, as measured by Standard
and Poor's composite index of 500 stocks, have fluctuated within a
narrow range recently on only moderate volume. At the September 1
close of 82.18, the index was about 2 per cent below the all-time high
reached around mid-July.
Customer credit in the stock market eased $69 million further
during July to $7.2 billion at the month-end. Customers' net debit
balances with brokers (except on U. S. Government securities) dropped
$81 million further to $5.3 billion, their lowest level since August
1963. "Purpose" loans by banks to others than brokers and dealers
rose $12 million, however, and now total $1.9 billion, a new high.
Customers' net debit balances have declined significantly
from the $5.6 billion outstanding last November when initial margin
requirements were raised to 70 per cent, although stock prices increased
about 14 per cent over the same period. In fact, the magnitude of the
drop in customer credit is probably understated, due to technical
influences on the data stemming from the Ira Haupt liquidation last
fall and the AT&T "rights" offering in April. This downward trend,
contrasts sharply with the behavior of customer credit following other
recent increases in margin requirements. Earlier increases have

III -8
sharply reduced the rate at which credit was expanding, but the volume
outstanding did not decline until market developments dampened
enthusiasm for holding stock on margin.
Margin regulations now differ from those in force earlier,
primarily in the requirement imposed on undermargined accounts that
70 per cent of sales proceeds must be applied to reducing excess debt.
Although it applies only to net sales and not same-day substitutions,
this provision appears to have had considerable success in upgrading
margin account debt as stock prices have risen further on balance.
Financial intermediaries. July data on net savings flows to
mutual savings banks and savings and loan associations suggest that
these institutions are continuing to benefit from the tax cut. At
mutual savings banks the July gain was roughly double that for last
year, and at savings and loan associations--which typically experience
much larger gross withdrawals in July than in other months--there was
little change in total savings capital this July compared with a small
net loss a year ago. If rough allowance is made for seasonal influences,
savings and loan associations realized net savings inflows during
June and July that were nearly as large as the record gain experienced
in the early months of 1963.
U. S. Government finance. A note of hesitancy entered the
market for Treasury coupon issues toward the end of August. There
was a small rise in yields of most issues, but no strong evidence
of a basic shift in market psychology. The slight weakening of the

III -9
market was apparently related to a reduction of public demand and to
some increase in selling by investors, including commercial banks,
which appeared to be taking the opportunity to prepare for expected
fall loan demand or to realize capital gains. At the same time dealers
became somewhat less patient with their still sizable inventory of
notes and bonds.
The market was sustained in the latter part of August by
sizable official purchases of coupon issues, mainly by the System.
The Treasury trust accounts were also fairly persistent, though small,
buyers.
Under the circumstances, dealers gradually reduced their
positions, even though public demand tapered off. At month's end
dealer holdings of bonds due in more than five years were around $500
million, down from just under $800 million at mid-month and around $1
billion earlier in the month. The decline reflected official account
purchases of nearly $325 million of longer-term bonds during the month
of August, concentrated in the second half. After they took into
position about $430 million of 18-month notes in the August refinancing,
dealer holdings of 1-5 year issues were little changed during the
rest of the month despite official account purchases of around $225
million.

Treasury bill rates showed little net change during the second
half of August. For a brief period toward the end of the month, there
was a tendency for rates to decline even though the System was providing
reserves through purchases of coupon issues. This tendency reflected
sizable market demand, especially for December bills and for the Narch
ta:: bill that was auctioned Uednesday, August 20. But when this
demand faded, the bill market became more hesitant, and the 3-month
bill rate closed the month at 3.50 per cent. On iionday, August 31,
the Treasury announced that it would add $100 million to each of the
next four weekly auctions of 3-month bills. Dealer bidding in the
auction immediately following this announcement was cautious and
their awards were the lightest of the year.I l

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
U.S. balance of payments. Tentative data indicate a U.S. payments
deficit of almost $400 million in the four-week period ending 26th August.
The July deficit figure has now been revised upwards on the basis of more
complete information to total $687 million. Even after approximate allow-
ance for adverse seasonal influences, such a rate of deficit in these two
months would be well above the second quarter annual rate of $3 billion.
In July, short-term claims reported by banks declined $175
million, offsetting more than half of the extraordinary rise recorded in
June. The increase in these claims for the two months taken together
was below the rate of earlier this year.
The July drop in short-term claims reflected substantial re-
patriation of both dollar and foreign currency deposits which had been
placed abroad at mid-year when the Euro-dollar market and other foreign
money markets tightened temporarily. There was also some reflow from
foreign currency money market paper. On the other hand, there are pre-
liminary indications that,in contrast to movements in bank-reported claims,
nonfinancial concerns placed some funds abroad in July.
The July outflow on long-term bank loans totaled $55 million,
somewhat above the low net outflovwof the second quarter. The outflow
on new security issues was only about $30 million compared to $230 million
in the second quarter; however, the third quarter outflow is customarily
low and seasonally adjusted purchases of new issues in the second half
of the year are still expected to be about in line with those of the
first half.

IV -2
An important element in the deterioration in the payments posi-
tion since early this year has been the resumption of the cyclical rise
in imports. Total imports in the second quarter were $0.8 billion higher
on a payments basis than in the first quarter. In July imports picked up
sharply following a small dip recorded in June. The July import rise,
like that from the first to the second quarter, was concentrated in
materials and finished manufactures; imports of foods were unchanged.
Export figures for July are not yet available. In June exports
to Continental Western Europe declined further and were 10 per cent below
the first quarter average. Exports to Japan also decreased and there was a
fairly marked drop in shipments to Canada which up to then had been rising
very strongly. Exports to Latin America rose very sharply, however, con-
tinuing the rise of the previous eight months and there was also an increase
in exports to Britain.
Business and financial developments abroad. Trade and payments
positions have continued to strengthen in Italy and Japan. Britain's
trade deficit has increased, however, and the sterling exchange rate fell
further in August. Since midyear the French payments surplus has remained
large while the German surplus has diminished somewhat.
Britain's payments position has shown signs of further deterioration
and sterling has come under increasing pressure in the last three weeks.
On September 2, spot sterling was quoted at 278.44 cents,down nearly 0.5
cents from early in the month. Reserves fell by $92 million in August.
The trade deficit remained large in July. Exports declined again
and in June-July averaged nearly 5 per cent less than in the first quarter.

IV -3
About half of this reduction results from lower shipments to Common Market
countries. Imports, which had risen sharply in June, fell back again
in July and for the two months averaged the same as in the preceding five
months. The trade deficit in June-July was running at an annual rate of
$1.7 billion (on a balance of payments basis), $0.5 billion larger than
in the first quarter.
Indicators of domestic activity are mixed but point to some
moderation of demands. Industrial output was unchanged in June for the
sixth consecutive month. The volume of retail sales, excluding autos,
was also unchanged from May to June. In August, employment vacancies de-
clined further, after allowance for seasonal variation, and the unemploy-
ment rate rose to 1.6 per cent, partly because of a large influx of school
leavers into the labor force. Evidence of the continued strength of
domestic investment demand is afforded by a sharp increase in industrial
development certificates issued in the second quarter and by reports of
supply shortages in the construction sector.
German imports increased again in July while exports continued
to show little change from earlier months. The seasonally adjusted trade
surplus in July was less than half the average rate of surplus in the
first six months of this year. Official reserves had increased by $237
million in June because of an inflow of short-term capital funds, but
some reversal of these flows is indicated by a drop in official reserves
in July of $110 million and virtually no change in the first three weeks
of August. On the other hand, net foreign sales of German securities
which were very large in the second quarter following announcement of a

IV -4
proposed tax on foreign earnings from fixed interest securities, have
reportedly tapered off since midyear.
Following the rise in commercial bank reserve requirements on
August 1st, rates on 3-months money market paper increased by about 1/8
per cent.
French official reserves continued to show moderate increases
in the first three weeks of August. The trade deficit has diminished and
in July corresponded to a slight trade surplus on a payments basis: imports
in June-July were unchanged from the level of the three preceding months
whereas exports averaged somewhat higher.
June industrial production remained essentially unchanged from
earlier months. Construction activity has remained strong and demand for
building materials has reportedly been an important factor sustaining over-
all output in manufacturing and mining industries.
Hourly wage rates again increased in the second quarter by nearly
2 per cent and average hours worked have apparently remained high. So
far, however, retail sales remain below peaks of last year and have only
recently shown signs of some recovery. Seasonally adjusted Paris depart-
ment sales rose 1 per cent in July, following modest increases in the two
preceding months.
The National Credit Council has extended for another year the
existing directives on commercial bank credit. This action will limit
increases in bank credit to the private sector to 10 per cent during the
year beginning 1st October.
The Italian external position has continued to improve. A
further large payments surplus of about $120 millinn was recorded in July

IV -5
and large reserve accruals apparently continued in August. During August,
Italy paid $58 million in gold as its subscription to an enlarged quota
in the IMF and this month repaid $65 million of its drawing from the
Fund of last March, thus eliminating its net debtor position in the Fund.
The Italian Government has enacted new tax measures, including
increases in turnover and income tax rates. At the same time, social
security contributions are being reduced to lower labor costs and to
minimize the possibility of rising unemployment in the near future. There
has not yet been any significant rise in unemployment but industrial
production declined again in June and was 5.6 per cent below the first
quarter average.
Japanese balance of payments data for July indicated virtual
balance on current transactions for the first time since December 1962.
The $22 million fall in official reserves during the month resulted from
net repayments on short-term borrowings. In August, official reserves
increased by $12 million. Late in the month, advance import deposit
requirements covering approximately 20 per cent of total imports were
reduced from 5 to 1 per cent.

APPENDIX A: RECENT CHANGES IN BANK LIQUIDITY
The decline in bank liquidity which began in early 1962 has
continued this year under bank pressure to maximize earning assets.
From both a loan-deposit ratio and a liquid security holding point of
view, not only are banks less liquid than at the beginning of the
current economic expansion in 1961, they are also considerably less
liquid than in late 1959 and early 1960 when lending conditions were
the most restrictive of the postwar period.
These elements of the liquidity situation are shown in the
attached charts. Loan-deposit ratios have moved steadily upward since
the end of 1961, reaching about the previous postwar (1959-60) highs
in New York City and considerably surpassing those highs at other
classes of member banks. For all member banks, the current loan-deposit
ratio is around 62 per cent--4 percentage points higher than the
previous postwar high in mid-1960. (The present ratio for all member
banks was exceeded by only 4 percentage points in 1929, when broker
and dealer loans, which were used as liquidity instruments at the
time, are excluded.)
This rise in the loan-deposit ratio has been associated with
substantial growth in both deposits and loans, as contrasted with 1959,
when loans rose sharply but deposits were relatively constant. It may
be argued that the growth of time and savings deposits--with their much
lower turnover than demand deposits--has reduced the need for bank
liquidity relative to total deposits. But loan-deposit ratios are now
considerably higher than in 1959-60, and it should be remembered that
time and saving deposits totals currently include more than $12.5
billion of negotiable CD's that could contract rather quickly should
open market yields rise without a change in Regulation Q. In any event,
the decline in bank liquidity relative to total deposits tends to limit
the latitude that banks would have in meeting additional loan demands.
The counterpart of a rise in loan-deposit ratios over the
last 2-1/2 years has been the declining ratio of investments to deposits,
particularly Treasury securities. The relative decline in Treasury
holdings has been sharpest in maturities under one year, but the ratio
of these holdings to deposits is still above the 1959-60 low. However,
maturities in the one- to five-year range have also dropped markedly
relative to deposits, partly reflecting debt management emphasis on
advance refundings. As a result, the ratio of relatively liquid
Treasury securities (all those maturing within five years) to deposits
has been halved for the weekly reporting banks--dropping from 25
per cent in late 1961 to 12.5 per cent at the end of July--and is well
below the 19 per cent low point reached at the end of 1959. The
decline in this ratio for New York City banks (not shown separately)
is even sharper--dropping from 27.0 to 11.0 per cent over this period.
(Treasuries maturing in over five years at the weekly reporting banks
now amount to 5.5 per cent of deposits as compared with 6.0 per cent
in late 1959.)

A- 2
The loss of liquid Treasuries has been partly induced and
partly offset by expansions in bank holdings of tax exempt securities--
some of which would be readily marketable--and Federal agency bonds--
most of which are relatively short and have a ready market. As a
rough adjustment to conventional bank liquidity measures, allowance
was made for the growth in such holdings by calculating modified
liquidity ratios that include one-fourth of the tax exempt holdings
and all of the agency portfolios; the former allocation was used on
the grounds that about one-half of the total tax exempt portfolio is
indicated to mature within five years (according to surveys of the
Cleveland Federal Reserve Bank and reviews of recent bank examination
reports); but that only a portion of even these shorter maturities
would be readily marketable. When allowance is so made for the growth
in such holdings, the decline in the ratio of liquid investments to
deposits is modified, but the picture is not materially changed.
Modified liquidity ratios are still currently far below the end of
1961 and lower than at the time of maximum restraint in bank lending
conditions in 1959-60.
In the event of a surge in business loan demand, some funds
could be freed by curtailing other types of lending activity. However,
in certain areas where restraint has often occurred in the past--
lending to finance companies and Government security dealers--current
loan ratios are not especially high since funds from nonbank sources
have been readily available. Funds could also be diverted from real
estate lending, which has increased in recent years both absolutely
and relative to deposits. However, secondary markets for such loans
are limited and the existence of newly enlarged mortgage loan depart-
ments creates real incentives to maintain a substantial volume of such
lending activity. There could, however, be a reduction in the net
increases in bank mortgage loan portfolios, especially if there is a
slackening in aggregate mortgage demands. To be sure, some of these
and other assets could be sold and the funds shifted to business loan
demand, but the costs of such shifts--eapecially given the above
liquidity positions--could have a marked effect on loan rates.
The restricted liquidity and shiftability position of
commercial banks does not appear to have influenced lending attitudes
and, for that matter, has not attracted a great deal of attention
to date. The major reasons for this include the continued substantial
growth in total deposits and nonborrowed reserves, the fact that
business loan demand has to date not been characterized as unusually
strong, and the relative stability in interest rates which has
prevented depreciation in the market value of bond accounts.
Any substantial changes in any of these elements could
bring abrupt changes in the positions and attitudes of banks.
Current positions, therefore, appear to make the banking system
unusually responsive and sensitive to monetary policy and changes
in rates and rate structure. This does not mean that loan increases

are impossible. In particular, member banks, while less liquid now
than in 1959, are considerably less in debt to the System--$250
million as opposed to $1 billion in 1959. While each $100 million
of additional borrowing could support several hundred million dollars
of loans, increased borrowing--especially if unaccompanied by larger
increases in nonborrowed reserves and considering the current
liquidity level at the banks--would also tend to generate more
restrictive bank loan policies and upward pressures on lending rates.

APPENDIX B: PROPOSED HOUSING ACT OF 1964
The proposed Housing Act of 1964--the first major omnibus
housing legislation in three years--has been sent to the President.
Many provisions of this bill have implications for construction, includ-
ing the extension, liberalization, or initiation of a variety of
programs involving urban renewal, community facilities, public housing,
farm housing, and the FHA. Among other things, the bill provides a
$725 million additional authorization for urban renewal capital grants,
bringing the total to $4,275 million, and capital grant authority for
some 37,500 additional units of low-rent public housing. It also
authorizes the Federal Housing Commissioner, when necessary, to correct
structural defects for homeowners of new 1- to 4-family dwellings pur-
chased with FHA-insured loans--a change from the traditional view that
recourse by buyers could be only against builders.
Several provisions of the proposed Housing Act of 1964 would
have a direct effect on home mortgage markets. One authorizes FNMA to
guarantee and sell "participations" in first mortgages in which the
United States holds an interest. Buyers of such participations would
be assured of a guaranteed yield, with all servicing performed by FNMA.
According to the 1965 Budget document, this measure could involve the
sale of as much as $300 million in FHA and VA loans. The sale proceeds
would be treated as an administrative budget receipt.
Another provision of the Housing Act increases the statutory
limits on conventional real estate loans made by national banks to
80 per cent of appraised value (now 75 per cent) and to 25 years (now
20 years). In addition, savings and loan associations are granted
further leeway to compete with commercial banks and other lenders.
Associations insured by the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corpora-
tion are permitted to extend their present 50-mile basic lending area
to 100 miles, and the Federal Government and its corporations are
authorized for the first time to invest funds in share accounts of these
associations. Moreover, federally-chartered associations are authorized
among other things to make loans of up to $40,000 (now $35,000) on
1-family houses, to increase their holdings of loan participations, to
invest in general obligations of State and local government, and to make
loans for college education.
Larger loans per dwelling unit are authorized under several
FHA home and project programs, along with broadened FHA insurance cover-
ages (and smaller coinsurance risk) for private lenders. For example,
the maximum insurable amount of an FHA-insured 1-family home loan under
its regular program would be $30,000 (now $25,000).

B -2
In an effort to facilitate the conservation of older neighbor-
hoods, the Housing bill also authorizes the appropriation of $50 million
for a new, special revolving fund. Out of this fund the HHFA Administra-
tor can make rehabilitation loans to business or residential owners or
tenants in urban renewal areas, provided private financing is not avail-
able on reasonable terms. Such loans could not exceed 3 per cent in
interest, 20 years in maturity, and $10,000 per dwelling unit or
$50,000 per business property.
