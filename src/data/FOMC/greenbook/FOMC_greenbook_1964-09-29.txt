ioney markets have continued somewhat firmer in recent weeks
with the 3-month Treasury bill rate at or slightly below 3.55 per cent
and free reserves averaging around $60 million. The Government bond
market strengthened after mid-September, however, as dealers worked
down their positions and as investors became more confident about the
current level of long-term interest rates. Corporate and municipal
bond markets have reflected this change in investor sentiment only in
recent days in part because these markets were characterized by heavy
new financing by both businesses and State and local governments after
Labor Day.
Bank credit growth was substantial in September, reflecting
in part larger demands for funds by nonfinancial businesses over the
dividend and tax dates. Money supply growth in the first half of
September slackened further from the rapid rate in June and July,
although the increase since the first of the year continues at about a
4 per cent seasonally adjusted annual rate.
The third quarter balance of payments deficit now appears to
have been little different from that of the second quarter. Preliminary
figures show much smaller deficits in August and early September following
the very large July deficit.
Abroad, the sterling exchange rate has fallen further and
has had to be heavily supported. The British trade deficit, seasonally
adjusted, remained large in August.

THE DOMESTIC ECONONY
Industrial production, Continuing the uninterrupted advance
that began last December, industrial production expanded further in
August by .8 point to 133.5 per cent of the 1957-59 average, a level
about 6 per cent above that prevailing in the summer and autumn of
last year.
Consumer goods, business equipment, and materials all
continued to increase in August, seasonally adjusted. Output of
furniture and some other household goods rose further, and auto
production--subject to more uncertainties of seasonal adjustment than
usual in this model changeover month--increased slightly. Production of
industrial and freight and passenger equipment continued to advance.
August gains in output were widespread among both durable
and nondurable materials although in the steel industry production
changed little (rose only seasonally) from the advanced July level.
In early September, steel ingot production rose somewhat
more than seasonally. Although dealers held 30 per cent more new
cars in early September than a year ago, as strike protection, auto
production schedules indicate further increases in production for
September and the fourth quarter--with a fourth quarter average at
about 170 per cent of the 1957-59 average, about one-tenth above the
last quarter of 1963.
The uninterrupted expansion in total industrial production
in the last nine months has reflected widespread and substantial

II -2
increases among final products and materials, as shown in the following
table of seasonally adjusted data.

Output of iron and steel, low last autumn as inventories
were being reduced, rose the most--a fourth. Output of other durable
materials rose about 6 per cent, nondurable materials 5 per cent.
The increase for final products was 4.5 per cent, with changes in the
products shown ranging from a small decline for defense equipment
to a 10 per cent rise for industrial equipment. (On an annual rate
basis all these rates of change would be one-third larger--almost
8 per cent, for example, for the total index.)

II -3
Technical note: A recent review of seasonal factors for
75 series in the production index led to minor revisions for most
series from 1961 to date and to revisions of considerable importance
in a number of lines, such as electric power, textiles and equipment
parts. As a result, the course of the total index was modified
somewhat, with some dampening of the repetitive increases evident
from the end of the year to midyear and some upward revision of
changes shown from midyear to the end of the year. The major moves
during the 3-1/2-year expansion period since early 1961, however, are
similar to those shown before--a rapid initial recovery from early 1961
to late summer; a less rapid increase to mid-1962; little change in
the second half of 1962; a further marked advance in the first half
of 1963, accentuated by a steel strike threat; little change for a
few months as inventories of steel were reduced; and the renewed and
widespread advance since last autumn, already uninterrupted for nine
months.
Prices. While the index of industrial production has con-
tinued to rise lately, the index for prices of industrial commodities
has remained stable. The level prevailing in August and the first
half of September was the level reached last December, one-half per
cent above early 1963 but one-half per cent below the high in early
1960. Prices of foodstuffs in mid-September were up 1 per cent
from July-August, reflecting mainly somewhat higher prices for live-
stock, but they were unchanged from a year ago. The total wholesale
index remains within the narrow limits of its fluctuations during
the past 6-1/2 years.

II -4
The industrial average has remained stable as price changes
have continued to be selective, with a few decreases as well as
increases. Strong upward pressures have persisted in markets for
nonferrous metals, mainly tin and copper. Higher prices have been
announced recently for some tires and one type of woodpulp; in both
cases, prices had been down from levels in early 1960 and prices remain
lower than at that time. Meanwhile, prices of petroleum products have
continued to decline and those for lumber and plywood have edged down.
Reductions for some types of steel--now reflected in list prices
perhaps with some lag--have lowered the index for all finished steel
to 102.2 per cent of the 1957-59 average compared with 103.0 per cent
in the first half of this year; before last year's increases the
index was 101.2 per cent.
Tin prices have risen 30 per cent since early this year and
70 per cent since early last year and are up to about the peak reached
early in the Korean War. Free-world production in the 1960's has
been well below the mid-1950's and in most recent years has been
below consumption. The current deficit is being met by sales, at an
average annual rate of 20,000 tons, from the large surplus holdings
in the U.S. stockpile. U.S. consumption last year was 78,000 tons,
of which 22,500 tons came from scrap.
Short supplies and soaring prices for copper in the "free"
markets reflect--in addition to strong world demands and various
supply interruptions abroad--the loss of domestic output, equal to
about one-half a month's consumption in the U.S., caused by the strikes

II -5
that have just ended. In a similar situation prices soared to a peak
in April 1956 but then fell sharply as supplies caught up. The producers'
price for delivery in the U.S. has just been raised 2 cents to 34
cents a pound, and prices of mill products have been increased. The
producers' price was 33 cents at the high in 1960 and 46 cents at
the high in 1956.
Increases in prices of nonferrous metals are chiefly
responsible for the rise--6 per cent since June and 15 per cent from
a year ago--in the BLS daily index of 13 raw industrial commodities.
Over the past year, increases among the 5 metals in the index have
ranged from about 10 per cent (zinc) to more than 50 per cent (tin).
Hides have recovered moderately from a very depressed level while
rubber and textiles have changed little.
Prices of basic industrial commodities tend to rise with
eKpanding industrial activity, and the rise usually begins early in
business upswings. Thus a Seneral advance in industrial prices
invariably has been preceded by a rise in basic commodity prices. But
not every rise in basic commodity prices has been followed by a
general advance in industrial commodity prices. For example, the
index of 13 raw industrial materials rose 12 per cent from April to
November 1958, and increased somewhat further in 1959, but this rise
was not the forerunner of a general advance. On the other hand,
the rise of 15 per cent for raw industrials from early 1954 to early
1955 was followed by a widespread advance in industrial prices--and
a further 10 per cent rise in raw industrials.

II -6
The more comprehensive monthly index of sensitive industrial
materials--which includes lumber, plywood, fuell oil, and a long list
of textiles and nonferrous mill products as well as the usual list of
basic commodities--has changed little since April after rising 3
per cent from last autumn. This index has continued to show less
increase than in earlier periods of business expansion because, in
contrast with other times, upward price pressures have been limited
mainly to the nonferrous metals.
Discussion of the possibility of a widespread advance in
industrial prices has followed agreement on new labor contracts in the
auto industry, discussed in Appendix A. The settlements, estimated
at 4.3 to 4.5 per cent per year.-more than two-thirds in pensions
and other fringe benefits--were somewhat larger than generally expected.
That the industry has characterized the new contract as noninflationary
may be taken to mean that prices will not be raised for the 1965
models. But should similar settlements be negotiated in other
industries, specifically in steel, they might not be fully offset by
reductions in other costs--as through continuing increases in pro-
ductivity--or by lower profit margins. The steel contract can be
reopened as of January 1 with no strike permitted before May 1. A
similar settlement there would be above increases of recent years
but not much more than half those of the mid-1950's. Meanwhile, at
some point inventory demands for steel may be further expanded, a
possibility already being discussed in trade papers.

II -7
Labor market. Accompanying continued expansion in economic
activity, labor market trends continued favorable in Augustd In
trade and service-type industries, employment advanced and in manu-
facturing the average workweek returned to its high spring level.
The number of major labor market areas with substantial unemployment
declined to the lowest level since early 1960.
Total nonfarm payroll employment, seasonally adjusted,
increased only slightly in August. A similar hesitation in the upward
trend was experienced last year, however, and in both years was
accounted for by a decline in manufacturing employment. This decline
largely reflected the timing of the auto model changeover, not
adequately allowed for in the seasonal adjustment. Scattered, small
employment declines in some other durable goods industries in August
were offset by further increases in fabricated metals and machinery.
In soft goods industries, employment declined slightly. Employment
gains continued strong in trade, service, transportation and public
utilities. In contract construction, employment has remained relatively
stable since early this year.
Over the past year, total nonfa-m employment has increased
by 1.6 million. The services, trade, and State and local government
accounted for 1.1 million of the rise and manufacturing for 330,000.
Moving against the general trend, employment in major defense-type
manufacturing industries declined about 80,000 over the year.
Hours and earnings in manufacturing. Average hours, seasonally
adjusted, rose 0.2 of an hour in August, regaining the high level of

II -0
40.7 hours maintained from March through iay, The August increase
reflected substantial lengthening of the workweek (half an hour) in
both primary metals and transportation equipment. Very long hours of
work have also been maintained in machinery industries since the end
of 1963. In contrast, the average workweek was little changed from
the month before or the year before in nondurable goods industries.
Average hourly earnings of manufacturing production workers
declined 1 cent to $2,52. Ueekly earnings increased a little, reflecting
the longer workweek, and were $103. Weekly earnings so far this year
have averaged 3.7 per cent and hourly earnings 3.2 per cent more than
in the comparable period of 1963. The auto settlement, as noted in
Appendix A, provides for no increase in wage rates as such until next
September.
Major labor market areas. The number of major labor market
areas classified as having a substantial labor surplus--6 per cent or
more--declined by 3 in August, to 32 out of a total of 150 areas.
The number was the lowest since January 1960 and five fewer than a
year ago. Pittsburgh, Chattanooga, and San Juan, Puerto Rico moved
out of the Group D classification (6-9 per cent unemployment rate)
into the moderate labor surplus category, Group C (3-6 per cent). For
Pittsburgh, its reclassification meant the first reduction in unemploy-
ment below the 6 per cent level since November 1957. Improvement in
the steel industry was the major factor in Pittsburgh's reclassification.

II -9
Residential building. Since last autumn, despite a generally
strong advance in the economy, housing starts have been declining
irregularly. In August, according to preliminary indications,
seasonally adjusted private housing starts were at the lowest rate
since early 1963. On a three-month moving average basis, to allow
for the inherent volatility of the series, the rate for the most
recent period was 12 per cent below the peak reached in September-
November of last year,
Seasonally adjusted residential building permits are also
well below the levels prevailing in the latter part of last year,
for both single- and multi-family units. In recent months, however,
they have shown relatively little change.

Iortgage markets. Competition for mortgages has continued in
recent months, and, in August, the FHA yield series still remained
at the reduced level of 5.46 per cent established in the spring of
1963. Net inflows of loanable funds have generally remained above
year earlier levels and mortgage demands associated with new residential

II -10
construction activity apparently have been declining. Financing of
existing properties has continued to increase.
Indications based on data through July continue to point to
only a moderate further rise this year--perhaps $2 billion--in the
amount of mortgage debt expansion from the record of $29 billion last
year. That total reflected a rise of $4 billion from the $85 billion
expansion in 1962, which in turn was $6 billion greater than the
expansion of a little under $20 billion in 1961.
Among the major financial institutions, mutual savings
banks and life insurance companies so far this year have substantially
exceeded their year-earlier expansion rates for mortgage holdings.
Savings and loan associations have remained below last year's highs,
despite improved inflows in share accounts recently. At commercial
banks, increases have about matched the rise in the first three
quarters of 1963. Meanwhile, total holdings by government agencies
have edged upward somewhat. Last year, when net sales of mortgages
by the Federal National Mortgage Association were at an unusually
advanced rate, such holdings were still declining.
Consumers. Available data continue to indicate a large rise
in consumer spending in the third quarter, in the vicinity of $7 to $8
billion annual rate, or nearly 2 per cent. Purchases of nondurable
goods are showing another large gain; purchases of durable goods appear
to be up only a little.
The increase in disposable income in the third quarter is
probably about $5 billion, or 1-1/4 per cent. If these estimates are

II -11
approximately realized, the saving rate for the third quarter will be
7.5 per cent or possibly less. This would compare with the unusually
high rate of 8.2 in the previous quarter--the first following the tax
cut--and with an average of about 7 per cent over the past decade. The
sharp initial rise in the saving rate and the subsequent marked decline
have been in line with general expectations concerning developments most
likely to be associated with the tax cut. As consumers work their way
closer to the 7 per cent saving rate, the chances increase that consumer
spending will about keep pace with after-tax incomes rather than
rising faster.
In the first two weeks of September, seasonally adjusted retail
sales apparently were maintained at the record August level, with changes
small for both durable and undurable goods. August sales had topped July
by nearly 1 per cent. Retail sales this quarter are running about
2 per cent above the second quarter. Nondurable goods sales are up about
2.5 per cent, although the change since July is small. Durable goods
sales are up about 1 per cent, with automobile outlets showing some further
rise and sales at furniture and appliance stores little changed.
On a unit basis, sales of new automobiles in the first ten days
of September were a fifth below a month earlier--about the usual seasonal
decline--and a sixth above a year earlier.
Personal income advanced $2.5 billion in August to a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of $494 billion. Most of the increase ($2.2 billion)
was in wages and salaries. Wages in private industry rose at about the
rate prevailing since late 1963. A rise of $1 billion in government

II -12
payrolls was mainly attributable to the Federal civilian employee pay
raise; close to half of the $700 million rise in Federal payrolls, however,
represented a retroactive payment for July. Most other types of income
were up slightly in August.
Consumer credit. Reflecting a variety of influences, including
the tax cut last March, instalment credit in the first seven months of
this year expanded at an average annual rate of 10 per cent. This was
somewhat below the 12 per cent in last year's corresponding period and
well below the advanced rates of 1959 and 1955.
As in most other years, the pace of expansion has been quite
uneven from one month to another. After a rather moderate increase in
January, February saw the largest rise in almost five years and March
was not far behind. The rate of expansion promptly fell in April and
since then has followed a see-saw pattern.
In July, a rising volume of personal and nonauto consumer goods
loans carried net new borrowings to a $5.8 billion seasonally adjusted
annual rate, a pace a little above the average for the year to date.
It seems doubtful that this rate was maintained in August, from the
sketchy information so far available.
Repayments on instalment debt moved up to new highs in March
and again in May; changes in June and July were not significant. Exten-
sions have shown considerable variability throughout the period, reflect-
ing changes in sales of durable goods and varying intensity in the use of
credit to purchase these goods.

II -13
Orders for durable goods. New orders for durable manufacturers,
which tend to move ahead of production and sales but at times fluctuate
sharply from month to month, advanced 7 per cent in July and then
declined 9 per cent in August. While most of these large moves reflected
sharp changes for defense products, new orders for civilian products in
August were down moderately after rising in July.
Averaging of the July and August figures reveals that the level
of new orders for those two months was slightly above the second quarter
average. As shown in the table below the small increase over this period
reflected a rise in defense orders, which may prove temporary; new brders
for most types of civilian products showed little change from the advanced
second quarter rate.

Civilian products 0

Metals -1
Other durables 0
Shipments of durable goods also declined in August from the
pronounced July peak, and new orders, despite their precipitous drop,
remained above shipments. Thus the value of unfilled orders expanded
somewhat further. The August increase in the order backlog was mainly
in producers' equipment industries; those industries showed a gain of
13 per cent from the end of 1963 to August 31 while the total durable
order backlog was rising 10 per cent. The level of unfilled orders in
relation to new orders and sales continues well below the levels of the
mid-1950's.

II -14
Business inventories. The seasonally adjusted book value of
business inventories, which had shown very small increases in May and
June, was about unchanged in July at a level of $106.6 billion. Over
the period from April to July--particularly in July--business sales
increased substantially and stock-sales ratios declined generally.
Stability in inventories in July stemmed from a slight
decline at retail which about offset very small increases in stocks
at manufacturers and wholesalers, The decline in retail stocks
occurred at durable goods stores; inventories of nondurable goods
edged up further.
The increase in business inventories for the first 7 months
of the year totaled $1.5 billion, which was considerably less than
had been indicated by surveys of anticipations and one-third less
than the $2.2 billion reported in the corresponding period of 1963.
According to the latest Commerce Department quarterly
survey of inventory and sales anticipations, factory stocks are
expected to show increases of $400 million in the third quarter and
$700 million in the fourth, as compared with reported increases of
only $200 million in the first quarter and $100 million in the second.
Manufacturers expect a sales increase of a little over 2 per cent from
the second to the fourth quarter, which would be about in line with
the expected rise in inventories. Stock-sales ratios would therefore
show little change from the low second quarter level.
Agriculture. Dry weather during most of August lowered
crop prospects and reduced grazing capacity of pastures over most of

II -15
the Corn Belt and the North Atlantic States. Weather was more
favorable in the Southeast and the Uestern States and crop and
pasture conditions in these areas ranged from good to excellent.
Since late August, rains have revived pastures in some areas,
particularly in the Western Corn Belt, but probably have had little
effect on crop yields.
On September 1 the index of crop production was estimated
to be 2 per cent below the August forecast and 3 per cent below the
record output of 1963. The corn and soybean crops were among those
hardest hit by drought and yields of both were estimated to be 6
per cent below August 1 expectations. The corn crop of 3.64 billion
bushels now in prospect is 11 per cent below that of 1963 but the
soybean crop of 704 million bushels is only slightly below that
of 1963.
Nationally, farmers' cash receipts from sales of crops
will probably be reduced only moderately by the drought. Net income
may not be changed at all from earlier estimates because of lower
outlays than estimated for hired labor and some other major items
of production expense such as feeder cattle.
Farm debt. Debts of farmers amounted to $36.4 billion in
mid-1964, 11 per cent more than a year earlier. Farm real estate
debt, about half of the total, rose 12 per cent, continuing the
accelerated rate of increase of the previous two years. Demand for
land for farm enlargement continues to be strong and loanable funds
are apparently available to finance sales.

II -16
All the principal lenders expanded holdings of farm mortgages
in the year ending on June 30. Member bank loans were up 15 per cent,
insurance companies 14 per cent, and Federal land banks 10 per cent.
Some of the increase in member bank loans probably reflects expanded
investment in insured farm mortgages of the Farmerb Home Administration.
Ratios of size of loan to purchase price of farm are increasing. In
1963, the ratio averaged 70 per cent for the principal lenders as
compared to 64 per cent in 1959. However, repayments are holding up
well and delinquency rates are low.
Non-real-estate debt reported by the principal lending
institutions has tended so far in 1964 to rise at a slackening pace,
particularly in the Corn Belt. Less investment in hog production and
cattle feeding, because of low prices, is probably a factor.
Technical note: Non-real-estate debt owed by farmers to
nonreporting creditors probably amounted to about $7.5 billion at
mid-year on the basis of the new USDA benchmark data, as compared
with $10.8 billion for reporting credit groups. These recently
published data indicate that older estimates for nonreporting
creditors understated the amount of this credit by a third.

-. DOMESTIC FINANCIAL SITUATION
U. S. Government finance. Yields on Treasury notes and bonds
rose further from the last week of August to mid-September, but more
recently those rate advances have been in large part erased. Heavy dealer
inventories of Treasury notes and bonds and relatively light investor
demand contributed to the earlier yield increases, as did a growing
conviction among active market participants that the System was moving
to a less easy monetary policy. The market improved around mid-month,
as press stories noted that only a slight shift probably had occurred in
System policy, one aimed primarily at bolstering short-term rates.
The earlier rise in yields was also contained by the improving
technical condition in the market. Dealers made substantial further
progress in distributing the issues they acquired in the July advance
refunding and the August refinancing. On September 21 the dealers held
about $300 million of 1-5 year issues and $235 million of over 5 year
bonds, down from holdings of $550 million and $525 million respectively
on August 31.
Official account purchases, which were sizable in the first
two weeks of the month, contributed substantially to this progress.
Some public demand for longer-term Government securities was also stimu-
lated in the first half of September as their prices declined. The
market improvement after mid-September was not accompanied by any signifi-
cant expansion in public demand, but reflected mainly a change in dealer
sentiment.
Another factor tending to limit the rise in bond yields was the
outlook for Treasury financing--with no financing outside the short-term
area anticipated for the remainder of the year. A small routine refinanc-
ing is scheduled for November, and it is unlikely that new securities will
be offered much beyond the 18-month to 2-year area.

III -2
The Treasury is in a fairly strong cash position, with its
cash balance expected to rise to about $9 billion by the end of
September. Thus, most of the seasonal October cash deficit of around
$6 billion could be financed with only relatively small additional
borrowing. These funds, together with additional cash needed to meet
the much smaller November deficit, will probably be raised in the
bill area.

Treasury bill rates have edged higher since early September,
reflecting in part seasonal pressures associated with the fall dividend
and tax dates. The key 3-month bill, which was most recently auctioned
at an average rate of 3.54 per cant, is currently at its highest level
since early spring. Additions by the Treasury of $100 million to four
weekly bill auctions have contributed to the advance. In addition, the
System has not made any outright purchases of bills from dealers since
August 21, a period in which free reserves have also declined somewhat.
In this period System purchases of coupon issues have totaled $378
million.

III -3
Corporate and municipal bond markets. With the September
calendar of new corporate and municipal bonds up substantially from
the seasonally lou August volume, yields in both markets have advanced.
The average yield on new corporate bonds adjusted to anAaa basis
rose 15 basis points from late August through the third week of
September, and the various yield series on seasoned municipal bonds
advanced 2-7 basis points in the two weeks after Labor Day. Very
recently, however, demand for corporate bonds has strengthened, and
new issues are being offered this week at yields 3-5 basis points
below those set on comparably rated issues a week ago.

The yield advance on new corporate bonds over the four weeks
ended September 18 reflected, in addition to larger current offerings,
the increased uncertainty about near-term interest rate changes which
crept into all bond markets at the end of the summer. In response to
this uncertainty corporate underwriters raised reofferipg yields on
new issues and quickly terminated restrictions on earlier offerings
still in syndicate. These tactics undoubtedly exaggerated the

III -4
abruptness of the yield advance but they also kept underwriters'
inventories from rising appreciably. With the more recent general
improvement of bond markets, dealers have bid a little more aggressively
for new issues, and investors have quickly absorbed bonds offered
at slightly higher yields.
Responding to the larger calendar of September offerings,
dealers in municipal securities also raised yields on new offerings,
and offered concessions on unsold balances of old. However, these
adjustments were smaller and slower to develop than those made by
corporate underwriters, and dealers' advertised inventories of unsold
municipal issues rose from about $600 million at the end of August
to around $700 million currently.

Looking beyond September, offerings of new corporate bonds
definitely scheduled for October are relatively light, but the recent
addition of a $100 million State of California bond to the early
October calendar suggests that the supply of municipal bond offerings
may be maintained in the period immediately ahead at close to the
September volume.

III -5
Question has been raised whether presently anticipated
increases in plant and equipment expenditures are likely to require
a larger future volume of external corporate financing--if not in
October, at least before the end of the fourth quarter.
Present estimates for all of 1964 indicate that on an accrual
basis corporate internal funds are likely to run about one-eighth
above the 1963 level, the same increase as presently anticipated for
plant and equipment expenditures. Such a development would mean
that the unusually favorable spread between internal funds and capital
outlays, which has persisted since 1961, would be maintained for
the year as a whole.
A large part of the expected year-to-year growth in internal
funds, however, occurred in the first quarter, with the step-up in
undistributed profits because of the tax cut. Undistributed profits
increased only slightly in the second quarter and seem unlikely to
rise any further over the remainder of the year, as a continued rise in
dividend payments is expected to offset moderate further increases in
after-tax profits.
While the depreciation component of internal funds will
uaintain its long-term upward trend, the spread between total internal
funds and capital outlays is likely to have narrowed significantly by
the fourth quarter. The fact that this prospective development does
not as yet seem to have been reflected in corporate plans for increased
capital market financing may be due in part to the second reduction
of 2 percentage points in corporate Federal income tax rates, scheduled
for the start of 1965. This will undoubtedly result in another step-up
of undistributed profits.

III -6
Stock prices. The further general advance of stock prices
since late summer has carried the popular Dow-Jones industrial average
to a new record high above 872, nearly 2-1/2 per cent higher than the
previous peak reached in mid-July. Standard and Poor's composite index
of 500 stocks, while also up on balance in recent weeks, has simply
returned to the record mid-July high of 84. To some extent, this less
spectacular recent performance of Standard and Poor's index reflects
the fact that it rose more sharply than the Dov average during the
earlier summer advance. More generally, different rates of change
in the two series are attributable to the broader representation of'
industry groups in the Standard and Poor's index and to the fact that
prices of individual issues are weighted by the number of shares
outstanding, rather than by price alone as in the Dow average.
During September the further advance of stock prices has
occurred on average trading of 5 million shares a day. This rate of
activity is nearly 30 per cent higher than the seasonally low volume
prevailing in August.
Bank credit. Total credit at New York City and Chicago
weekly reporting banks increased $1.1 billion during the two weeks
encompassing the September tax and dividend period, somewhat less
than in the comparable 1963 period.

Credit extended by banks directly to nonfinancial businesses
over this two-week period was much greater than in the corresponding
weeks of the two preceding years. Borrowing by metals companies and
public utilities, which usually account for the bulk of the tax-
period rise, was only moderately heaviar than usual, but that by
retail and wholesale trade concerns was much larger than in other
recent years.
Funds provided to business indirectly--through the acquisition
of Treasury bills, loans to U.S. Government securities dealers, and
loans to finance companies--over these two weeks were about $600
million less than in 1963 and $50 million less than in 1962. In

III -8
both earlier periods Treasury advance refundings had occurred. Although
the corporate liquidation of P's with Government securities dealers
was about the same this year as in the comparable period of other
recent years, dealer needs for bank financing remained moderate as
they were able to cover a substantial part of these run-offs through
liquidation of their large trading positions in longer-term coupon
issues.
As reported earlier, the August 19 survey of CD maturities
suggested that corporations were planning to meet a larger share of
their tax and dividend period needs for funds this September through
run-offs of CD's. At banks in New York and Chicago, the decline in
outstanding CD's over the two weeks ending September 16 was $311
million, compared with scheduled maturities at these banks of $300
million on the tax and dividend dates. Last year, when these
scheduled maturities were $345 million, outstandings at New York
and Chicago banks declined only $181 million.
Combined data for all weekly reporting banks through
September 9, and for New York and Chicago banks for the week ending
September 16 indicate that credit expansion this September is running
below that of 1963 but above that of 1962. Loan expansion has been
somewhat less than in the previous two years, but holdings of U.S.
Government and other securities are up more.
Money supply and time deposits. Preliminary data for the first
half of September show an increase of $200 million in the seasonally
adjusted money supply indicating some further slackening from the
rapid growth in June and July. The annual rate of growth for 1964

III -9
remains at 4.0 per cent, the rate prevailing through August. U.S.
Government deposits declined somewhat more than ulsual over the first
half of September, but the projected rise for the second half is larger
than usual.
Seasonally adjusted time and savings deposits at commercial
banks grew $700 million in the first half of September according to
preliminary estimates. This expansion was slightly above the average
semi-monthly increase in other recent months. The annual rate of
growth for 1964 through mid-September was 11.4 per cent, 3.3 per cent
below that of 1963.
The moderate acceleration of inflow to savings deposits at
city banks which developed in August appears to have continued in
early September. A substantial rise in other time deposits also
occurred in the first two reporting weeks of September but was more
than offset by a large decline in the week of the 16th, mainly
reflecting the run-off of CD's on the tax date. Over the three
weeks ending September 16, total time and savings deposits at city
banks declined much more than in the comparable weeks last year.
The seasonally adjusted annual rate of turnover of demand
deposits at banks outside New York City declined to 35.0 in August,
the same as the June rate and close to the average so far this year.
Over the past three months, turnover has averaged about 5.4 per cent
above the level of a year earlier.
Bank reserves. Over the three weeks ending September 16,
free reserves at all member banks averaged $60 million, substantially

III -10
below the $119 million average of July and August./ Excess reserves
at $399 million remained at the same level, but borrowings at
$339 million were well above the level of the previous two months.
Over the three-week period from August 27 through September 16, the
effective rate on Federal funds dropped below 3-1/2 per cent on
two days and some transactions took place at a lower rate on three
other days.
Total required reserves, unadjusted for seasonal variation,
rose much less than usual between August 27 and September 16, largely
reflecting a more than seasonal decline in reserves required against
U.S. Government deposits. On the other hand, reserves required
against private demand and time deposits increased more than seasonally.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
U. S. balance of payments. The over-all payments deficit
on "regular transactions" in the third quarter may now be estimated,
from preliminary data through mid-September, at about $1-1/4 million
before seasonal adjustment. A large deficit in July was followed by
much smaller deficits in August and in early September. Transactions in
September included inflows of funds which presumably reflected as in 1962
and 1963 some temporary repatriation of short-term investments from abroad
to meet tax payments, and one transaction involving a large outflow of
capital to Canada.
After seasonal adjustment, the third quarter deficit at an
annual rate was probably not substantially different from the $2.7 billion
second quarter deficit.
In September, a $254 million payment was made by a group of
U.S. public utilities to the Government of British Columbia for water
control on the Columbia river. Of this amount, about $50 million is to
be used to repay outstanding short-term debts in New York, while the
Canadian dollar proceeds received by the Government of British Columbia
have been lent pending later use to other Canadian provincial authorities
and financial institutions who otherwise might have sought to borrow
funds in the United States. However, the $200 million in U.S. dollars
which was sold to the Canadian Treasury has been invested in nonmarketable,
nonconvertible U.S. Government securities with maturities ranging from
14 months to 7 years; these securities will not be included in Canada's
official reserves. The Department of Commerce is currently planning to

IV -2
treat this Canadian purchase of special U.S. government securities as
a foreign long-term investment in the U.S.; with this treatment, the
deficit balance on regular transactions would be $200 million less than
indicated above.
Business and financial developments abroad. Sterling has been
under further heavy pressure in the last three weeks in foreign exchange
markets and has received substantial support from the British authorities.
In Europe generally, industrial output appears to have been level into the
early summer. Recent data on Canada confirm a pause in the rise in
activity in the spring and early summer but also include indications of
renewed expansion getting underway.
Britain's continued large payments deficit led to a further
weakening in the spot exchange rate this month and to some widening of the
discount on forward sterling. On September 22, spot sterling was quoted
at 278.36 cents, down .07 cents from early in the month. British authori-
ties have provided heavy support to the rate.
Through August, British reserve losses this year had totaled only
about $70 million despite the large over-all payments deficit. This was
due mainly to the fact that, through June, there was a rise of $360 million
in sterling liabilities, principally as a result of improved payments
positions in the overseas sterling area.
In August the seasonally adjusted'trade deficit remained at the high
rate of the previous seven months; both exports and imports were up from
the levels of earlier months. Retail prices increased further and were
about 3 per cent above the first quarter average.

IV -3
The level of domestic activity continues to show little change.
In July, industrial production and the volume of retail sales were the
same as in June and as in the early months of the year. Employment rose
somewhat more slowly in August than in earlier months. Recently released
data show that, through the second quarter, domestic private capital
expenditures were still rising strongly, both in manufacturing and in the
distributive and service industries. Also additions to manufacturers'
inventories, particularly of finished goods, were agaib very large in the
second quarter.
In France, there are additional indications of a leveling off
of demand. In recent weeks there have been further cuts in working hours
among automobile manufacturers and auto sales in the last half of the year
are now expected to be 6 per cent below 1963 levels. According to recent
surveys of business expectations, manufacturers were generally less
optimistic about production prospects in June and July than in earlier
months. Survey respondents noted that order backogs in consumer goods
industries had continued to drop while those in the equipment industries
had failed to increase further.
The budget for the current year is now expected to be in
approximate balance compared to a deficit of over 8 billion francs in
1963. The draft budget for 1965, which was released last week, is also
balanced. It provides for a much smaller increase in expenditures than
in other recent years and for a slight reduction in personal income tax
rates. The budget also includes provisions for reducing taxation on
income from stocks and bonds in an effort to encourage the development of
the domestic capital market.

IV -4
The German industrial production index rose in July but for
June and July together averaged the same as in A ril-May. Increases in
output over this period were noticeable only in consumer goods industries.
New orders in June-July, however, were up 7 per cent from the two preced-
ing months; the largest gains were again in the consumer goods sector
but substantial additions were also made to the ilready heavy backlog
of domestic orders for capital goods.
Official reserves fell by $26 million n August and there was
reportedly no appreciable net movement of short-t irm capital funds.
Official reserves had declined by $109 million in July when the trade
surplus diminished sharply, and when high seasona outpayments for services
and some net outflow of short-term capital occurred. Both in July and
August, there were reported inflows of foreign funds into German equities.
Japanese industrial production was unchanged in July after ris-
ing 4 per cent in June. The trade deficit in August remained close to
the reduced July level, less than half the average monthly deficit of the
second quarter; imports continued to fall. In the first two weeks of
September, the yen appreciated against the dollar by 1/4 per cent, the
first significant change in the rate in five months.
Canadian economic indicators for June show somewhat lower levels
of activity compared to early spring. Manufacturing output and retail
sales were down 3 and 2 per cent respectively.
Renewed increases in activity in the second half of the year are
still anticipated, mainly because of the large planned expansion of capital
expenditures for the year. Recent indicators lend support to this view.

IV -5
In June, unfilled orders in manufacturing were up nearly 5 per cent
from March. Seasonally adjusted exports showed a further increase in
July, despite the completion in June of wheat shipments to the Soviet
Union, and were 6 per cent above the second quarter average. The un-
employment rate declined in July and in August after rising in the
late spring.

APPENDIX A: THE CHRYSLER -UAW SETTLEMENT
The Chrysler and the United Automobile Workers agreement of
September 9, 1964, has been accepted by Ford,and General Motors is
expected to approve generally similar terms. The new 3-year Chrysler
contract grants fairly sizable gains to its employees and reflects a
concerted and successful effort by the union to vastly improve benefits
to older and retired workers, reduce working time and provide pro-
duction workers with more of the prerequisites and security generally
associated with white collar or salary employment. To obtain these
large nonwage benefits the union gave up a 2.5 per cent or 7.5 cents
improvement factor which would have been effective September 1, 1964,
and a 2-cent cost-of-living adjustment accruing to employees in early
September under the cost-of-living formula. Both wage increases have
been included in the companies original offer to the union in mid-
August. As an additional concession the union also agreed to reduce
the number of company paid union representatives (stewards and commit-
teemen) in each bargaining unit.
Published estimates of the value of the new contract have
varied widely, in part, because the company and unions differ in
their estimates of the cost of some provisions and also use a
different base of total wage costs to determine the average annual
rate of increase over the three-year contract period. The calculations
in the attached table, for each of the major items, are based on
information obtained from various sources--neither the union nor the
companies have issued any official breakdown of the package.
Staff estimates of the major provisions of the contract
add up to between 52.3-55.4 cents per hour over the three-year period
(see Table 1 following). Chrysler reported average hourly wages,
including fringes, of production workers prior to the new contract
were $4.05 per hour. The union estimate of the total hourly wage
is somewhat lower, about $3.80 per hour, but they exclude employer
contributions to social security funds, relief time and other items
from their calculation of the wage base. Using the company estimate
of $4.05 per hour, the average annual rise in wages and fringe
benefits amounts to 4.3-4.5 per cent per year. This is larger than
the more than 3 per cent per year increase estimated in the 1961 and
1958 settlements but below the almost 6 per cent annual rise agreed
to in the 1955 contract. The 1955 contract was valued at about
45 cents for three years but the wage base was substantially lower
then.
A major feature of the settlement is the relatively high
proportion of added costs for nonwage items. Increased pensions
and early retirement provisions alone account for almost two-fifths
of the total. Reductions in work time, including increased relief

time, one added week of vacation and the two extra holidays are
estimated as an additional one-fifth and accident insurance and
medical benefits as another one-tenth.
New supplementary unemployment benefits are not included
as an additional cost since employer contributions into SUB funds
were not increased but will continue at 5 cents an hour. Estimates
of pension improvements are based on probable number of retirees,
future employment levels, mortality of current pension recipients,
etc. However, the amount of employer contributions into the pen-
sion fund is determined by the trustees and is not part of the
collective bargaining agreement. In the past, employer contributions
have often differed from estimated costs in respect to amount and
timing, reflecting the size or change in asset value of the funds,
accuracy of the estimates, etc. In recent years, for instance,
General Motors has been able to increase benefits considerably
without significantly increasing contributions.
Direct wage rate increases, which total 16 cents, are
less both in relative and absolute terms than in the three earlier
contracts. Because there is no wage increase in the first year,
additions to workers'money income are limited to the elimination
of a 3-cent per hour employee contribution for insurance and
possible quarterly cost-of-living adjustments starting December 1,
1964.
The strong emphasis on nonwage items can be largely
explained by recent trends in employment and age structure in the
automobile industry and the union's firm conviction that automation
will continue to erode job opportunities in the future. Production
worker employment in the industry has been rising since 1961, but
the number now employed is only slightly higher than in 1960 and
well below the 1953, 1956 peaks. The average age of production
workers in the automobile industry has been rising rapidly and
the older workers have increasingly been able to influence union
policy. Their distaste for the assembly line and desire for increased
leisure, adequately compensated, is well known to union leaders and
sociologists. The younger worker, who traditionally gave high
priority to gains in current income, now also gives greater emphasis to
efforts to reduce work time and the age of retirement as a way of
protecting his job and his long-term income potential.
Some Implications of the Chrysler Settlement
Total labor compensation in the auto industry, including
nonwage items, can be reasonably estimated to rise at a rate of from
4.3 to 4.5 per cent per year under the new contract, which establishes
the increase as above the noninflationary 3.2 per cent guidepost figure
used by the Council of Economic Advisers. However, evaluation of the
impact of this particular contract on the industry or the economy is
complex and deserves more sophisticated analysis than merely sub-
tracting the estimated cost of the contract from the guidepost
calculation.

A- 4
There are at least three aspects of the Chrysler settlement
which require some critical attention: a) the direct impact on the
automobile company's prices and on workers' income; b) pattern get-
ting implication for other unions; and c) increased expectations of
price inflation by business, investors and those concerned with
economic policy.
The direct impact of the settlement appears to be very
limited. The general expectation is that the automobile companies
will not raise prices. The prospective increase in' labor compensation
is believed to be below productivity gains in recent years in the
industry.
With no rage increases to be paid in the first year of the
contract, additions to the income stream will be relatively minor, and
the settlement can not be thought of as contributing in the year ahead
to any significant increases in consumption expenditures by auto workers.
For comparative purposes it might be worth noting that a year ago Septem-
ber the auto workers received an increase of 8-9 cents in hourly earnings,
mostly because of the improvement factor and a small rise in the cost-of-
living adjustment. Also, many of the new fringe benefits are phased
over th- three-year period and add little immediately to income. Retired
workers will not receive added income until the beginning of next year
while earlier retirement benefits do not become available until Septem-
ber 1, 1965. Additional holiday time cannot be taken until May 1965
and most improvements in insurance become effective in 1966.
The auto agreement set two major targets for other unions to
shoot at: the size of the package, and the very favorable pension and
retirement provisions. However, the contract offers no support to other
unions for large direct wage increases. This will undoubtedly tend to
firm up demands of other unions, but the size and nature of their
settlements will depend on prevailing economic conditions in the country
and in the industries when the new contracts are negotiated.
Since the mid-fifties a number of developments in collective
bargaining have tended to reduce the pattern effect of a major settle-
ment. There has been a steady increase in the number of long-term
contracts and as a consequence any major advance in wages and fringes
takes a relatively long time to diffuse through the wage structure.
There also has been a growing tendency over the years for unions and
management to establish closer and continuing relationships and to pro-
vide important institutional arrangements which gear collective bargain-
ing much more closely to specific conditions in individual companies or
industries than to "a pattern setter". Substantial differences have
occurred among industries with respect to length of contract, cost of
contract, and other terms. It is very difficult to determine from
individual collective bargaining agreements what the wage pattern is
these days, except, in very broad and not always meaningful terms.

A- 5
The automobile workers are at or close to the top of the
range among factory workers in the amount of their weekly earnings and
the value of their fringe benefits. Their settlements have generally
been well above the average for manufacturing industries and closer
to those of the teamster and building trades. Many other unions may
have wished to duplicate the automobile contracts, but they generally
have settled for less and it has taken them much longer to obtain the
fringe benefits received by the auto workers. Most unions, for
example, do not have cost-of-living escalators or have been forced to
eliminate them in recent years. Supplementary unemployment benefits,
the big breakthrough for the automobile workers in 1955, have-not yet
been adopted by most industries. The copper mining companies have just
set up, in negotiations concluded this month, a fund for supplementary
unemployment benefits--9 years after the automobile industry.
Recent negotiations in other industries have not so far re-
flected any special upward wage pressure. The copper settlement pro-
vided for wage and fringe gains estimated at 30 cents per hour over
3 years, relatively less than in autos and within the guideposts. The
Michigan Bell agreement, which tends to set a pattern for the entire
Bell System, provided for a wage increase averaging 10 to 11 cents per
hour this year but no changes were negotiated in fringes. Percentage-
wise, this increase in wages of a little more than 3 per cent is in
line with settlements for other recent years in the telephone industry.
In rubber and meat packing, settlements were also "noninflationary."
Another factor limiting the spread of the auto contract terms
is the relatively small number of major negotiations scheduled for this
year or early next year. Negotiations will begin shortly in the agri-
cultural implements industry. The UAW represents the workers here and
is expected to obtain an automobile-type agreement, but the package is
not expected to be as large. Contracts will also expire for most auto-
mobile parts companies in the next few months. The union has practiced
a good deal of wage differentiation among the auto suppliers depending on
size, profitability, and employment prospects in each company. It is
highly unlikely that average wage and fringe gains in these companies will
come up to those achieved in the auto settlement; they never have in the
past. Prices for most of the products are very competitive in these
companies since a large part of this output is purchased by the major
automobile companies. Demands by the union have been kept relatively
low to prevent plant shut-downs and loss of jobs. The major issues
in the current railroad and longshoremen negotiations involve special
problems and relate to automation and job security.

A-6
The wage reopening scheduled in the steel industry early
next year is the most important labor negotiation in prospect. The
steel workers are likely to gain larger wage and fringe increases than
in other recent years but well below the very high settlements of the
mid-1950's. The union is sure to point to rising output and profits
and to a consumer price advance of almost 5 per cent since the last
wage increase in 1961. But there is real union concern with the
generally declining trend in steel employment and union fear of
further inroads in steel output from international competition.
These factors may have a restraining influence on union demands.
In 1962 and 1963, unfavorable conditions in the steel
industry led to relatively low settlements of 2.5 and 2.0 per cent
per year, significantly below the average for manufacturing industries.
The last wage increase was in October 1961. At that time the cost-
of-living clause was also eliminated. Rumors that the Human Relations
Committee has been meeting and hopes to work out a settlement before
the end of the year have not been verified. However, in 1963, an
agreement was reached well before the strike deadline, without a
formal reopening and with the help of the Human Relations Committee.
In 1962, the announcement of an agreement also occurred before the
contract expired. An early settlement in steel would tend to limit
the amount of potential inventory accumulation and subsequent
liquidation. Glass, paper, and rubber are other industries which
will be engaged in collective bargaining in the first half of next
year.
Expectation of any immediate and widespread general rise
in prices directly traceable to a general rise in unit labor costs
seems to be unwarranted. Average increases in labor compensation in
other industries are likely to be below those in the automotive
industry and more in line with the guideposts. The very nature of
current collective bargaining assures that impact of labor cost
increases will be diffused and spread over a long period. Pro-
ductivity increases have been high and if continued at current rates
would tend to offset a large part or the whole of the higher labor
compensation. There still are excess supplies of available labor
which have and will continue to limit union demands, especially for
direct wage increases. However, firming of union demands is likely
to lead to selective price increases in some industries, either
because the wage gain is higher than gains in productivity or demand
is strong enough to support a higher price level for some products.
