IN BROAD REVIEU
Information becoming available in the past three weeks
suggests that the rise in industrial production this autumn has been
at least seasonal, despite a strike affecting half the automobile
industry, and that gross national product has continued to rise,
although not in all respects in accordance with expectations. In
particular, business inventory holdings, seasonally adjusted, at the
end of August were reported no higher than at the end of July--or
June. Retail sales figures for August were revised upward and the
preliminary figure for September, though down 1 per cent from August,
remained slightly above the July level. Employment in mid-September
showed some further increases and as in earlier months this year was
about 1.6 million higher than a year ago. Uage settlements similar
to those in the auto industry have been reached in the agricultural
equipment industry, but it may be noted that here the same union was
involved and that recent settlements with other unions--as in meat-
packing--have involved less increases in wage costs. Industrial prices
continue to be reported--through mid-October--as showing little
change; the daily index of basic industrial materials has risen
further reflecting additional increases for copper and tin.
Aggregate demands for funds, though still large, probably
declined a little recently. Business needs for outside financing have
tapered off, after a more than seasonal build-upover the September
tax and dividend payment period. The autumn financing needs of the
Treasury are also down a little from what had been expected earlier

I- 2
due to a somewhat better cash position. Financing demands of consumers
and State and local governments continue large, though they do not
appear to be rising.
Despite this recent apparent slackening in the demands
for financing, the privately held money supply probably increased
further in the first half of October, due in part to a larger than
usual decline in Government balances with the commercial banks. Time
and savings deposits continue to show substantial growth. Outstanding
CD's have recovered part of their mid-September decline, but are
still below their late sumer high.
Interest rates on U.S. Government securities have recently
been influenced by a cautious market attitude concerning the future
course of the economy and of monetary policy. There were technical
pressures in the Treasury bill market stemming mainly from large
dealer positions and high financing costs for a time, and the 3-month
bill was quoted briefly at 3.60 per cent bid. A small amount of
Federal funds was purchased at 3-5/8 per cent--above the discount rate--
but this reflected more an effort by one large bank to accustom
the market to more flexibility in the rate rather than general money
market tightness. Free reserves averaged a little lower, and member
bank borrowings a little higher, in September and early October
than in August.
In the capital markets, U.S. Government bond yields have
risen a little since mid-September, while those on other bonds have
remained generally stable. Stock prices have risen to new highs,
reflecting the favorable business and profits outlook.

I -3
The balance of payments deficit now appears to have been
somewhat lover in the third quarter than in the second. (Subject
to revision on basis of later statistics to be available for Supplement.)
The trade surplus in July-August was at about the second quarter rate,
and outflows of U.S. capital were reduced.
In Continental Europe and Japan the trend towards more
moderate domestic expansion and greater balance in e::ternal accounts
continued. The pound sterling remained under pressure.

THE DOIESTIC ECONOY
Industrial production. Industrial production changed little
in September as the General lotors' strike late in the month sharply
curtailed auto production. In August and September, industrial
production, at 134 per cent of the 1957-59 average, was 6 per cent
higher than in the autumn of 1963, 30 per cent above the recession
low of early 1961, and 22 per cent above the pre-recession high of
1960. (August revised to 133.7; September 133.9)
Auto assemblies in September were 572,000 units compared with
a scheduled 675,000 units. The seasonally adjusted auto index declined
to 146 per cent from 165 per cent in August. This decline along
with the drop in truck production amounted to a loss of .4 of one
point in the total index. Even if work is resumed at General Motors
on iMonday, October 19, output in October will total no more than
about 600,000, compared with an original schedule of 875,000, and
the seasonally adjusted auto index will decline to about 120--another
.4 of one point loss in the total index.
In September, production of household furniture declined
and output of television sets changed little while output of some
other consumer goods increased further. In business equipment
industries, industrial machinery rose further and output of commercial
machinery remained at a high level. Steel ingot production rose
and shipments of steel mill shapes and forms probably increased;
heavy demands for steel for current use are being supplemented by
inventory demands on the part of steel-users preparing for a possible
strike next May.

II -2
Construction activity. Seasonally adjusted new construction
put in place in September remained within 1 per cent of the peak reached
in March and April and again in the carly summer mbnths of this year.
Private residential activity edged downward further in September and
was slightly below a year ago, but private nonresidential activity--
already at a record rate--moved higher and public activity was unchanged
after a two-month decline.
A conspicuous feature of developments since March, when
residential activity passed its high, has been the continued upward
movement in business and other private nonresidential construction
generally. This has appreciably moderated the decline for the private
sector as a whole and has been the main factor limiting the reduction
in total construction activity. Meanwhile projections recently
published by a number of trade sources suggest levels of construction
expenditures in 1965 higher than those shown here for September,
including, in the case of F. W. Dodge, a rise even for residential
building.

II -3
Prices. In the past three weeks, the wholesale price index
for industrial commodities has remained stable, although prices for some
nonferrous metals have increased further. Wholesale prices of food-
stuffs have declined somewhat as the end of the farmers' strike and
seasonal forces have combined to expand marketings of livestock.
Industrial price changes have continued to be selective, with
strong upward pressures confined to a few nonferrous metals. Some steel
producers have formally increased prices on reinforcing bars nearly
17 per cent, restoring prices to the level of early 1961. U.S. Steel
reports that it is continuing to sell on a negotiated basis, but that
prices have been higher recently. Since mid-September prices of tin
have increased about 15 per cent further and prices of copper in the
"free" markets about 20 per ctnt further. Chilean producers have raised
prices 2-1/2 cents, to 35 cents a pound; other foreign producers have
not followed. The domestic price for primary refined copper, now 34 cents,
typically has been 1-1/2 cents above foreign prices because of the import
duty.
The increases in tin and copper since mid-September account
for a further rise of 3 per cent in the BLS daily index of 13 raw
industrial commodities. Since September 1963, when the sustained rise
began, this index has increased 18 per cent, reflecting chiefly increases
in nonferrous metals.
The consumer price index declined .1 per cent in August. Prices
of foods, apparel, autos, and some other goods showed small, seasonal
declines while prices of services continued to rise slowly. Compared with
a year ago, the total index was up 1.0 per cent.

II -4
Labor market. The employment situation continued relatively
firm in September. Nonfarm employment (establishment series) advanced
somewhat further and was 1.6 million larger than a year ago; this
year-over-year differential has been maintained since early this year.
For average hourly earnings, the increase in September was about the
same as last year and the increase since the start of 1964 was about
the same as in the first 9 months of 1963. The unemployment rate at
5.2 per cent in September was little changed from August and somewhat
below the 5.5 per cent of September 1963.
Perhaps most noteworthy in September was the selective nature
of the employment increase; gains in the metal-working and metal-using
industries accounted for all the 60,000 rise in manufacturing. In
nonmanufacturing industries almost all the rise was in State and local
government employment, mainly reflecting the addition of new teachers
as schools reopened with larger enrollments. Construction employment
declined somewhat.
The volatile metals industries showed substantial increases
between the second and third quarters of 1964, in contrast to little
change a year earlier. Most other groups had somewhat slower employment
increases in the third quarter this year than last year. Total nonfarm
employment increased by about the same number as last year in the
third quarter and also earlier in the year.

equipment.
Since May the unemployment rate appears to have leveled off
at slightly above 5 per cent. The rates for most groups in the labor
force have not changed significantly in recent months. Compared
to a year ago, however, some groups have fared better than others.
At 14.2 per cent in September, the unemployment rate of teenagers
was only moderately lower than a year ago; expansion in the labor
force of young workers has about kept pace with increases in employ-
ment. Unemployment rates of experienced wage and salary workers
and of adult women have shown greater improvement. The jobless rate
for married men has remained at about 3 per cent.
Hours and earnings. The average factory workweek in
September, at 40.6 hours seasonally adjusted, continued at the high
level maintained over the past year. A sharp lengthening of the

II -6
workweek in primary metals industries to more than 43 hours and a
further rise in transportation equipment to 42.6 hours offset declines
in most other industries.
Average hourly earnings rose 4 cents to $2.56 in September;
the rise was largely seasonal and a similar increase occurred last year.
Over the past year hourly earnings have increased by 9 cents, or
3.6 per cent. Part of the advance has been due to the recent shift
in employment towards the higher-paying, longer-workweek metal goods
industries. If an adjustment is made for these inter-industry shifts,
the advance in hourly earnings has been 3 per cent over the past year,
about the same as in the previous 12 months. Weekly earnings advanced
to about $104 in September, 3.4 per cent more than a year ago.
Increased overtime in the metal industries contributed to the rise in
weekly wages.
Business inventories. In August the book value of business
inventories was unchanged for the second month, as accumulation at a
stepped-up pace by manufacturers was offset by decumulation at
distributors.
Factory stocks increased over $200 million in August and
for July and August accumulation totaled $320 million. This rise
compares with an increase of only $250 million for the entire first
half of the year but nevertheless is not large and appears about in
line with manufacturers' expectations. (According to the latest Commerce
quarterly survey, a $400 million increase was anticipated for the third
quarter--to be followed by a $700 million increase in the fourth
quarter.)

II -7
Stocks held by durable goods manufacturers which had been
rising in the second quarter, continued on up in the summer months;
and inventories of nondurable goods, which had declined appreciably
in June, stabilized in July and August.
Distributors' stocks declined $320 million in July and
August after increasing $1.2 billion in the first half of the year.
Autos accounted for an important part of the earlier run-up and for
nearly half the July-August decline. Ample stocks permitted unusually
large auto sales during the model change-over period. Some of the
remainder of thesummer decline in stocks--concentrated at retail
outlets for other durable goods--may also have reflected unusually
strong sales. A further decline in retail auto stocks appears in
prospect for September, with sales up sharply further and General
Motors out of production late in the month.
Retail sales. According to the advance report, seasonally
adjusted retail sales in September were off 1 per cent from the record
August level, but sales for the third quarter as a whole were 2 per
cent above the second quarter. A revision raised the August figure by
,7 per cent.
The September decline stemmed from a 2.5 per cent drop in
nondurable goods sales, which had advanced steadily and by a sub-
stantial amount over the preceding seven months. The nondurable
decline was centered in apparel and general merchandise stores and
restaurants. In September a year ago, these same categories had
declined, causing a similar decrease in total nondurable goods sales;

II -8
seasonal factors may need to be revised. As compared with last
September, sales of nondurable goods were up about 6 per cent and for
the third quarter as a whole the increase was also 6 per cent.
Total durable goods sales rose 2 per cent, bringing the
two-month increase from July to September to 5.5 per cent. Owing
mainly to sharply higher auto sales, durable goods sales in August
and September were 12 per cent above a year earlier; nonauto durable
goods sales were up 6 per cent.
In September, after revision of the month's adjustment
factor to reflect earlier and more clustered new model introductions
this year, seasonally adjusted new car sales showed a rise to an
annual rate of 8.5 million units. This, the highest figure for any
month of record is 6 per cent above August and 18 per cent above
September a year ago. The General Motors' strike does not appear to
have appreciably retarded sales by that company's distributors in
September.
Consumer credit. Consumer instalment credit increased $435
million in August, or $5.2 billion seasonally adjusted annual rate.
This rate, as shown in the table, was somewhat less than in July,
about the same as in the second quarter. Increases for personal,
nonauto, and repair and modernization paper were smaller than in July;
auto credit moved up more than in July in response to the sharp rise
in auto sales.

Commercial banks and credit unions obtained a somewhat
larger-than-usual share of the auto loan business in August, mainly
at the expense of the sales finance companies. These companies held
their share in the over-all totals, however, by increasing their lending
on other goods.
Agriculture. Near-record farm output in 1964 is indicated
by the October 1 crop report and the latest reports on livestock
production. The October 1 index of crop output, although 3 per cent
belou 1963 is 9 per cent above the 1957-59 average. Production of
livestock and products is estimated to be at a new high, 13 per cent
above the 1957-59 average, reflecting large output of beef and poultry.
Except for some damage from tropical storms, September
weather was favorable for crops in the South. The cotton crop improved
2 per cent and the current estimate nearly equals the 15.3 million
bales of 1963. Rains in the East North Central and North and Middle
Atlantic states were too little and too late to improve yields of
corn and soybeans.

II -10
The 137 million ton production of feed grains now in prospect
is considerably under utilization expected in 1964-65--close to the
149 million tons used last year--and stocks of feed grains are thus
likely to be reduced substantially. With the increase in the cotton
crop estimate, however, there is no longer the prospect of a reduction
in the large cotton stocks on hand.
Pasture feed conditions continued short through September
in many areas. Nationally, the October 1 condition was 69 per cent
of normal for that date, 11 points below the 1958-62 average. September
rains improved pasture feed prospects from Texas northward through most
of the Corn Belt, but in the North and Middle Atlantic States,
pastures deteriorated and many dairy herds were on supplemental
roughage. Temporary emergency increases in milk prices of about 1/2
cent per quart have been granted in some areas, mostly in the South
Central States and the lower Midwest.
The three government emergency assistance programs are
being widely used by farmers in drought and storm damaged areas this
year. Haying and grazing privileges on diverted cropland have been
granted in 1,046 counties and parishes, twice as many as last year.
CCC feed grain stocks are available to farmers in 336 counties (about
the same as in 1963) at 75 per cent of the prevailing support price
for feeding to dairy cattle and at the support price for other uses.
Feed grains have been donated to the five Florida counties almost
inundated by tropical storms and special funds have been allocated to
Louisiana. Emergency operating credit is available to farmers in the
drought and storm disaster areas at a 3 per cent interest rate for purposes

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL SITUATION
U. S. Government finance. Although remaining in a narrow
range, interest rates on U. S. Government securities edged slightly
higher in the first half of October following their downdrift after
mid-September. The more recent rate movements have reflected market
caution over the possible course of monetary policy and continuing
pressures on the money market. On October 6 the 3-month bill was
briefly quoted at 3.60 per cent bid, equalling a 4-year high previously
reached in late February of this year.

Recent activity in
by trading among dealers and
have tended to remain on thethe Treasury bond market has been dominated
other market professionals, as investors
sidelines while waiting for the interest
rate outlook to clear. The market has searched speeches and statements
by System and Treasury officials for policy hints, and the seemingly
diverse hints they have found have triggered only minor price
adjustments in both directions.

III -2
Dealers have continued to reduce their holdings of coupon issues.
In a period of a little more than two weeks, ending October 9, holdings
of issues maturing in over one year declined $235 million to a level of
$355 million. About 75 per cent of this decline was accounted for on a
net basis by System and Treasury purchases.
The most recent uptick in Treasury bill rates reflected dealer
efforts to reduce heavy bill positions, on which financing costs were high.
In the latter part of September and in early October dealers had to finance
sizable residual needs at the New York City banks where borrowing costs
often exceeded 4 per cent. By the second week of October dealers hadmade
good progress in reducing their bill holdings, as a sizable market demand
from public funds and other investors was supplemented by seasonally large
System purchases of about $540 million. On the other hand, outright demand
for bills by large corporations apparently has failed to pick up as much
as expected following the mid-September tax and dividend dates. Most
recently, dealers have rebuilt their declining inventories somewhat as
a result of very aggressive bidding in the October 9 weekly auction.
Dealer awards in this auction were a record $1.1 billion.
The recent advance in bill rates has extended to most other
short-term debt instruments as may be seen in the accompanying table:

In addition, quotations on day-to-day money have also risen on
some recent days to 4-year highs, with some Federal funds trading at
3-5/8 per cent and dealer loan rates posted by New York City banks as
high as 4-1/4 per cent. It was reported that the bulk of Federal funds
transactions at 3-5/8 per cent involved one major New York bank. This
bank reportedly was not motivated by either an unusually tight money
position or inability to borrow from the Federal Reserve. It apparently
hopes to introduce greater rate flexibility into the Federal funds
market, so that there would be a wider range within which funds could be
both bought and sold to accommodate such temporary borrowers as dealers
and correspondent banks.
The Treasury is expected to be in the market after mid-October
to raise additional cash to meet seasonal drains. These cash requirements
are likely to be somewhat smaller than projected earlier--by perhaps
$1 billion--due to a continuing favorable cash position. Total cash
financings of $4 to $4.5 billion are currently projected for the balance--

III -4
of 1964. The Treasury has indicated that it will raise this money in
the short-term, probably the bill, area.
The Treasury's next regular refinancing of November 15 maturi-
ties will involve a relatively small $2-1/4 billion of publicly-held
securities. It will announce the terms of this operation late this
month. The market generally anticipates an 18-month issue to be offered
in the refinancing, probably for cash.
Corporate and municipal bond markets. Yields on seasoned
municipal bonds have remained generally stable since the third week in
September. While the average yield on seasoned Aaa-rated corporate
bonds has edged a little higher over the same period, that on newly
issued corporate bonds has declined--virtually eliminating the 10 basis
point spread which developed between seasoned and new issues in September.
In general, current yields in both markets are appreciably above those
prevailing at the end of the summer.

The recent mark-down of yields on new corporate bonds has
reflected changes in the volume of public offerings being brought to
market. From late August through much of September, an expanded calendar
of public offerings had induced cautious bidding on the part of underwriters

III -5
and led to a sharp run-up in new issue yields. Since then, with only
a light supply of public offerings scheduled for October, underwriters
have attempted to market new issues at lower yields. Investors have
resisted these efforts, and most recent offerings of new corporate
issues have received a slow reception. Underwriters' unsold syndicate
balances have consequently grown, reportedly to around $100 million.

While public offerings of new corporate bonds definitely
scheduled for October and beyond are at an unusually low level, press
reports and insurance company commitment data both suggest that the
volume of corporate financing being arranged through private placements
has accelerated. Among the large private placements listed by the
financial press in recent months have been offerings from several
well-known manufacturing companies which on other occasions have
borrowed in the public market. Similarly, several large placements
have been listed recently for utility companies, although in the past
such companies have been encouraged by regulatory agencies to
place new bonds through competitive bidding.

IlI -6
Takedowns of corporate private placements in the first
seven months of 1964 fell $250 million behind those for the like period
of 1963, but preliminary data for August--a month in which public
offerings were unusually low--show private placements of close to $500
million, $150 million more than a year ago. This change thus tends
to confirm the general impression created by press reports, that the
recent year-to-year short-fall in public offerings of corporate bonds
is being at least partly offset by expanded private placements.
Yields on seasoned State and local government bonds have
remained generally stable in recent weeks, notwithstanding further
substantial new offerings, the continuing high level of dealer
inventories at close to $700 million, and some further discussion of
a possible shift to a less stimulative monetary policy. Good receptions
accorded large new offerings of public housing and State of California
bonds have helped to maintain this yield stability.
Stock market. Common stock prices, as measured by Standard
and Poor's composite index of 500 stocks, have recently moved into
new high ground on average daily trading of a little over 5 million
shares. Closing at 84.96 on October 13, the index was nearly 1-1/2
per cent above the previous peak reached in mid-July. While the average
of Dow-Jones industrial stock prices has shown only a slight further
rise since late September, the broader Standard and Poor's index
has moved steadilyhigher over most of the same period,
Strength in stock prices continues to reflect favorable profit
expectations and the persistent buying of institutional investors.
Discussion of inflationary possibilities in the period ahead has

III -7
undoubtedly also stimulated some demand for stock recently, but
little evidence of accelerated speculative intetest has been reported,
particularly on the part of small investors,
Mortgage market developments. Contract rates on conventional
first mortgages were little changed in August, at 5.77 per cent for new
home loans and 5.90 per cent for loans on existing houses, according
to data from the Home Loan Bank Board. Naturities and loan-to-value
ratios also remained at or near the more liberal levels reached earlier
this year as active competition by lenders for mortgages has continued.
Average prices paid for houses continued to move appreciably higher,
however, and largely because of this, loan amounts in August averaged
6 per cent more than a year earlier--for loans on used as well as
new houses.
Foreclosures on nonfarm real estate (mainly homes) increased
further in the second quarter of the year and were appreciably higher
than a year earlier, although not up so much as in other recent years.
Increases in foreclosures were reported both for Government-underwritten
and conventional mortgages.

The September expansion, like that in August, was spread
through all major loan and investment categories. Investments in U. S.
Government and other securities, essentially municipal and agency issues,
accounted for one-half of the expansion, although the increases in8.4
the year.

III -9
both investment groups were smaller than in August. At city banks,
holdings of Treasury bills rose more than total holdings of Governments.
Holdings of short-term notes and bonds also rose while those with
maturities of more than one year declined. A substantial unwinding
of the September rise occurred in the first week of October, when
holdings of Governments at New York and Chicago banks declined more
than they had increased in all of September.
The $1.5 billion increase in total loans in September was
smaller than the increase in August, but exclusive of security loans the
increase was substantially larger. For the third quarter as a whole,
the annual rate of grouth in both cases was less than in the first half.
The strong surge of business loan demand that developed during
the mid-September tax and dividend period did not carry through the
month. The seasonally adjusted increase of $700 million in September
was about the same as in August, although higher than in other recent
months.
In September, demands for commercial and industrial loans
were quite strong in a number of major categories, particularly trade,
metals, petroleum and chemicals, and public utilities. However,
there was a large offset to the September rise in loans to public
utilities and retail trade at New York City banks in the first week
of October. The decline in loans to utilities may have been in large
part in response to the large volume of capital market financing in
September. In construction and textiles, loan demand weakened in Sep-
temb,-r and bank holdings of acccp':anccs also declined.

III -10
Since last spring, there has been a marked difference
between business loan and business inventory developments. Prior to
that time, the basic trends in business loans outstanding and in total
business inventories had been quite parallel. This relationship was
generally true over the preceding decade, and was strikingly close
over the preceding two years. Since April, however, business loans have
gone up much faster than total business inventories. From April through
August, business loans rose $1.7 billion, compared with a rise of only
$250 million in inventories. This development would seem to give
further support to the view that general corporate needs for funds--
for plant and equipment, inventories, and receivables--may have
advanced more rapidly relative to internal cash flows than earlier,
thereby generating a growing need for outside financing. With no
immediate prospect for a slackening need for plant and equipment or
receivables financing, and with some lielihood of a pick-up in
inventory accumulation, a further acceleration in business loan
expansion is possible in the months ahead.
Money supply, deposit turnover and time deposits. The
seasonally adjusted money supply expanded $800 million in September
to a level of $158.0 billion. Over the third quarter, the annual
rate of growth was 6.2 per cent, double the 3.1 per cent rate
prevailing in the first half of the year.
The annual rate of growth in the currency component of money
supply slackened to 4.8 per cent in the third quarter, appreciably
below the growth rates of 6.1-6.3 per cent in the preceding three
quarters. New seasonally adjusted data on currency in circulation

III -11
indicate that growth in the larger denomination currencies, particularly
$50 and $100 bills, has slowed considerably this year from the 1963
rate. However, growth rates for $1 bills and coin have risen, possibly
in:part in response to hoarding of silver certificates and coin in
view of the changed outlook for silver.
Seasonally adjusted time and savings deposits at commercial
banks expanded $1.1 billion in September. This increase, comparable
to that in August, brought the annual rate of growth for the third
quarter to 10.8 per cent, slightly less than the 11.0 per cent rate
prevailing in the first half of the year.
At city banks, savings deposits'increased less in September
than in the corresponding month of 1963 and 1962, and other time
deposits, largely because of the decline in CD's over the tax period,
fell more. Since mid-September, CD's have been regaining their pre-
tax date level rapidly at New York City banks, but slowly elsewhere.
Turnover of demand deposits at 343 centers outside New York
City rose to 35.5 (preliminary) in September, the same as in July
but above the 35.0 average prevailing in August as well as in the first
half of the year.
Bank reserves. Free reserves at all member banks averaged
$82 million in September, below the $111 million average in August.
Excess reserves averaged $423 million, about the same as in August,
but borrowings, at $341 million, were $30 million higher.
During September the effective rate on Federal funds fell below
3.50 per cent on three days, with some transactions at a lower rate on
seven days. In the first week of October, the effective rate fell
1/ Based on the average of daily figures for all of the reserve weeks
ending in the month as used in the reserve memorandum to the FOMC,
rather than an average of all days in the calendar month.

III -12
below 3.50 per cent on one day, but on two other days some purchases
and sales took place at 3-5/8 per cent.
After rapid expansion in the first three weeks of September,
seasonally adjusted reserves against private demand deposits declined
substantially in the last two weeks, but the average for the month
rose by over $100 million. Preliminary data for the first week of
October again show a large expansion.

FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS * UNITED STATES

IV -1
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
U. S. Balance of Payments Preliminary weekly indicators
show a large US payments deficit in early October, apparently repeating
the pattern of recent quarters, when the deficit has occurred mainly in
the first month of the quarter. Moreover, October often shows an in-
crease in the payments deficit because of window-dressing by Canadian
banks; most of them end their fiscal years this month.
The deficit on regular transactions for the third quarter
(unadjusted) is now estimated at either $1100 million or $900 million,
equivalent to seasonally adjusted annual rates near either $2-1/2 billion
or $1-3/4 billion. The difference between the two estimates depends on
whether a purchase by the Canadian Government of $204 million of non-
marketable, nonconvertible U.S. securities is to be regarded as a
"special transaction" or as a "regular" foreign long-term investment
in the United States. If the lower rate of deficit is used, it will be
important to recognize that the payment by U.S. power companies that
produced the addition to Canadian Government holdings enabled British
Columbia to relend in Canada the Canadian dollar proceeds. Some, at
least, of this financing took the place of Canadian issues that might
otherwise have been made in the United States. On the other hand, if
the higher rate of deficit is used, it will have been temporarily
swollen by the lumpiness of the Canadian transaction. Hence, the
underlying rate of deficit in the third quarter is probably best
thought of as lying between the two alternative figures.
U.S. capital outflows, so far as present data go, remained
small in August. Long-term bank loans continued on the high plateau

IV -2
that has persisted since early 1963, but in August the principal
borrowers were Mexico and the Philippines, whereas earlier Europe
accounted for most of the outflow. Net short-term bank credits to
foreigners were again negligible, as net repayments by Canada and
Europe offset new credits to Latin America and Japan. U.S. banks
reported small outflows of liquid funds in August, while there was a
small inflow on securities transactions -reflecting continued US sales
of foreign stocks, with no significant net flows on new issues or US
corporate securities.
U.S. exports declined slightly in August from the July peak,
while imports remained at advanced levels; the July/August trade surplus
was about $6 billion at an annual rate, unchanged from the second quarter.
Business and financial developments abroad. On the Conti-
net and in Japan the trend toward more moderate domestic expansion and
greater balance in external accounts continued. The pound sterling
remained under pressure and was supported by the Bank of England with
the help of international credit facilities.
The British pound was under more or less continuous selling
pressure during the latter part of September and the first part of
October. Since September 14 support by the Bank of England has kept the
spot rate from falling below 278.30, and more recently the rate has
fluctuated around 278.34. Publication of September reserve losses of
$45 million equivalent was accompanied by a Treasury statement dis-
closing that some use had been made during the month of the credit
facilities made available by foreign central banks. These include the

IV -3
$500 million swap arrangement with the Federal Reserve and newly entered
into credit arrangements with the central banks of Belgium, Canada, France,
Italy, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Germany.
The German industrial production index for August stayed at
the high level attained in July so that the index for the two months
combined rose 1.6 per cent from May-June. Some slackening in the pace
of expansion may be indicated by downward fluctuation in incoming
domestic orders in August together with a moderate rise of 3 per cent in
foreign orders. For July and August combined the total orders index was
1 per cent below the March-April peak and only 1 per cent above the Janu-
ary-February level. Producer prices of industrial goods rose 0.3 per cent
in August, the hrgest monthly increase in nearly a year, to a level 1.5
per cent above the year earlier. Productivity increases in the past year
have been such as to prevent serious inflationary strains on the economy.
The German trade surplus was sharply reduced in July-August
to an average of $63 million, as a result of declining exports and
sharply rising imports, especially industrial imports. Since foreign
aid and reparations outflows were largely unchanged the reduced trade
surplus, together with greater-than-seasonal outflows on account of
tourism and over-all balance on capital account, combined to produce
balance-of-payments deficits averaging over '$30 million in the two months.
In France, despite the stabilization program, the rate of
growth of real GNP from 1963 to 1964 is now officially forecast at 5.2
per cent, greater than the 4.2 per cent increase forecast a year ago;
greater also than the actual rate of increase of 4.8 per cent from 1962

IV -4
to 1963, Much of the 1964 rise had already occurred by the first half
of the year. The forecast for 1965 shows a slackening of the years-over-
year rate of growth to U.3 per cent. Price indexes continue to rise at
a slower rate than last year, due partly to price freezes and partly to
tighter monetary and fiscal policy.
Official French reserve gains (adjusted for special trans-
actions) came to $94 million in the third quarter, down sharply from the
rise of over $300 million in the second quarter,
The Italian balance of payments continues to show favorable
results: the over-all surplus was $151 million in July, and $160 million
in August; and the rise in official reserves was $150 million in September.
Though in 1963 there was a $112 million deficit, this quarter is normally
a seasoanlly favorable period for Italy. Unadjusted for seasonality,
the third quarter surplus may prove to be double that of the second
quarter, despite reversal of the net flow of capital, which was heavily
inward in the previous period. In addition to seasonally high inflows
for tourism, the improvement in the third quarter was due to continuing
reductions in payments for imports and further increases in receipts for
exports, each by about 10 per cent compared with the second quarter.
Italian industry is, however, operating considerably below
capacity; reportedly about half of all business enterprises are working
at less than 30 hours a week, and the rest between 30 and 40 hours.
Unemployment rose 18 per cent from April to July. The emphasis of
monetary policy is therefore being shifted to greater ease; it is not
yet certain what the direction of fiscal policy will be in 1965.

Iv -5
In Canada over-all industrial production did not change
such in July; however a revival of economic activity is suggested by
modest increases in July as compared with June in new orders, inventories,
motor vehicle sales, retail trade, and housing starts. Price increases
were quite moderate.
Japanese official reserve rose $12 million in both August
and September, perhaps reversing a trend that has been generally down-
ward for almost a year. These reserve gains probably reflect mainly a
greatly reduced third quarter trade deficit, which, on an unadjusted
basis, was less than one-third that of the second quarter. The capital
account appears to have been in approximate balance in July and August.
The industrial production index leveled off in July and
August after an upward surge in June. From the first of the year
through August, industrial production rose 9 per cent, compared with a
13 per cent rise in the comparable period of 1963.

APPENDIX A: OUTPUT AND CAPACITY IN THE CURRENT EXPANSION
Over the expansion period so far--from early 1961 to the third
quarter this year--output in manufacturing has risen 30 per cent while
capacity has increased 15 per cent, resulting in an increase in the rate
of capacity utilization from about 78 to about 88 per cent. During the
same period, estimated capacity utilization for 17 major industrial
materials has risen from around 69 to 88 per cent.
The significance of these figures for analysis of economic
prospects is widely regarded as great, but there is wide disagreement
as to what the significance is. In one view, for example, 88 per cent
is far short of 100 per cent, and leaves plenty of room for further
advance, even though 100 per cent is recognized to be unattainable
by a considerable margin in an economy characterized by continually
changing demands and production processes and by marked fluctuations
in activity differently timed in different industries. In another
view, an over-all rate of 88 per cent may be accompanied by enough
evidence of extensions of delivery dates and upward price pressures
to seriously threaten price stability. A third view is that 88 per
cent is a moderate rate because it is below the 92 per cent average
of rates "preferred" by businessmen the last time they were asked.
Uncertainties of interpretation are increased by the rough
nature of the basic concept of capacity and of the measures that can
be constructed to represent it. In the steel industry, for example,
current operations are said by some industry people to be close to
maximum because numerous finishing facilities are being fully used--
even though output of ingots could be greatly increased from the
current rate of 80 per cent or less. In aluminum, the situation is
the other way around, with ingots being produced at full tilt while
finishing capacity is more than ample to process all ingots available.
The rate of capacity use is important not only as it relates
to price prospects but also as it relates to plans for capacity
expansion; it was, in fact, primarily in connection with this subject
that the index of capacity use for all manufacturing was developed
at the Board. Earlier, the materials index had been developed at
the Board chiefly as an aid to price analysis.
The purpose of this account of recent developments in
capacity use is to provide background information that will be of some
assistance in interpreting a broad range of developments relating
to prices, capacity expansion, plant and equipment expenditures,
production and employment.

Advance in capacity utilization since early 1961
The rise in the over-all utilization rate in manufacturing
during this expansion has occurred in three periods, as is shown in
Chart 1. In the initial advance from the recession low in early 1961
production increased much more rapidly than capacity--see Chart 4--
and the utilization rate rose 7 percentage points in three quarters--
to 85 per cent in the final quarter of 1961. In the next two years,
except for the period of steel inventory accumulation in the second
quarter of 1963, output rose less rapidly than in the initial stage
and, with capacity expanding more rapidly, the utilization rate
increased further by only one point--to 86 per cent in the fourth
quarter of 1963.
From late last autumn to the third quarter of this year,
manufacturing output expanded at an annual rate of nearly 8 per cent,
outrunning the estimated 5.3 per cent annual rate of increase for
capacity; as a result the utilization rate rose from 86 to 88 per cent.
As indicated in Table 1, increases in utilization rates have occurred
in two-thirds of the group of manufacturing industries, with the
greatest rise, by far, in iron and steel. The run-up in the
utilization rate for 17 major industrial materials--see Charts 1 and
3--was much more pronounced during this period--from 81 per cent to
88 per cent--largely due to the sharp rise in steel ingot production,
which is much more important in the materials index than in the all-
manufacturing index.
The 88 per cent level
In the light of past experience an 88 per cent rate of
capacity utilization in manufacturing is not an extreme. During the
Korean War period from mid-1950 to mid-1953, the rate was continuously
above 88 per cent, and in the first half of 1953 it rose to a post-
war peak of 96 per cent. In the next expansion period it peaked
at 92 per cent, in the fourth quarter of 1955. Relative to rates
in most recent periods, however, the current rate is relatively high;
except for a single quarter in 1959, affected by an inventory build-up
in anticipation of a steel strike, it is the highest since 1956.
Comparisons with the 1950's
The current situation differs from earlier postwar periods
of high utilization rates in important respects. It is unlike the
1950-53 Korean period, because of differences both in the intensity
and sources of demand and because of the controls on prices and
materials use that were then in effect. It differs significantly
from the 1955-56 period in respect to such features as the speed
of expansion in production, the composition of demand and production
and the nature of available resources of plant and equipment. A
less rapid advance in production this time and greater reserves of
capacity appear to have been important elements contributing not only

to a long period of stability in industrial prices, shown in the lower
panel of Chart 1, but also to the longer-sustained expansion in plant
and equipment outlays shown on Chart 4.
Operating rates in durable and nondurable goods industries
One of the differences between the current situation and
that in the mid-1950's is that this time production in industries
producing durable manufactures has not been so high relative to
capacity. The third quarter rate this year was 86 per cent as con-
trasted with 93 per cent in the second half of 1955. The figures are
plotted in Chart 2.
Production of nondurable manufactures approached 90 per
cent as early as mid-1961 and then showed little further change until
the third quarter of this year when it moved up to 92 per cent, a
level as high as was reached at any time in the mid-1950's. While
some nondurable goods industries such as textiles show wide cyclical
fluctuations, many--such as food products, petroleum products and
paper and pulp--do not experience wide shifts in demand, and non-
durable goods industries as a group characteristically have operated
nearer to capacity over long periods than durables.
Among durable goods, as may be seen in the first and fifth
columns of Table 1, estimated operating rates in August were below
those in December 1955 for all groups except transportation equipment
and nonelectrical machinery. The significance of differences in
some groups such as iron and steel and nonferrous metals, however, may
not be so great as the figures might suggest. Although the August
rate shown for the iron and steel group is 85 per cent,many steel
fabricating facilities were operating close to full capacity.
Within the group of nonferrous metals and products, output
of copper refineries would have been higher except for strikes. With
copper production in various other countries curtailed and world
demands unusually strong, prices in free markets have skyrocketed
and producer prices have advanced to 34 cents in the United States
and 35 cents in Chile. Aluminum ingot production has been at capacity
since February; prices, which had declined substantially between
mid-1960 and mid-1963, have been raised moderately. Fabricating
capacity has been ample, however, so that fabricating margins have
narrowed. For lead and zinc, refining capacity has not limited
supplies; it has been mining of ores that has not kept up with
expanding demands, leading to repeated increases in prices from
earlier reduced levels.
Advanced operating rates prevailing in various nondurable
goods industries have not led to any general advance in prices in
this area, although there has been considerable testing of markets

A- 5
and some price advances have held. Despite the high operating rate
indicated for petroleum products, markets for these products have
been weak most of the time and current prices are considerably below
those of a year ago.
Demand, production, capacity, plant and equipment outlays and prices
From study of the behavior of capacity utilization rates
for particular industries it is clear that the same utilization rate
has different implications in different industries. Beyond that,
considering the record for broad aggregates, it is clear that there
is no "magic" capacity utilization number that automatically triggers
price advances and that historical analogies with respect to capacity
utilization should be drawn only with great care.
One reason that upward price pressures have not been greater
and more widespread in this long expansion period since early 1961
is that increases in output--and particularly in new orders--have
at no time been so sharp as in some other periods such as that from
mid-1954 to the end of 1955. The increase in the rate of capacity
expansion from 1961 to 1962 was less marked than that from 1954 to
1955 but capacity expansions in 1963 and 1964 have been fully as
large as those in 1956 and 1957, taking account of the difference in
levels of capacity. For the most part a balance between output and
capacity has been maintained, almost as though "the importance of being
on time" had been recognized and plans for capacity expansion fitted
to realistic appraisals of prospects; one question now is how well
additions to capacity already under way will take care of any further
increases in demands for goods. So far demands have not been
inflated by any inventory build-up of great significance and selective
upward pressures on prices have reflected the strength of final
demands, in some instances in combination with curtailment of supplies.
In the period ahead the cumulative sources of expansion
could lead to further strengthening of final demands and also to an
inventory build-up--as in steel, with a strike threat--which together
would put additional pressure on capacity and set in motion the long-
threatened general advance in prices--but such developments are not
ordained. For example, growing conviction that the steel wage
settlement will come relatively early and be relatively moderate
could cause significant reappraisal of recently announced inventory
policies of major steel consumers. Further increases in demand
could then be of an orderly sort and be fairly readily accommodated
by additional supplies coming from continuing increases in capacity.
The extent of such capacity increases planned at the end of last
year in various industries is indicated in Table 1. Actual supply-
demand relationships and price developments will depend, additionally,
on a variety of domestic and international influences affecting costs
and competitive conditions--not discussed here. In this connection,

A -6
one of the important questions is how far any increases in costs
stemming from increases in wage rates will be offset by the lowering
of costs through installation of new, more efficient equipment,
either in capacity expansion or in modernization of existing facilities.
Description of capacity statistics cited
Statistics on capacity and its utilization are in a
developmental stage, as their counterpart, the labor force and
unemployment statistics were some thirty years ago. So necessarily
the estimates used in this analysis are at best crude approximations
with varying standards and definitions.
Federal Reserve Board major materials indexes
The Board's staff has developed indexes showing monthly pro-
duction series and annual capacity levels for 17 major manufactured
materials. These indexes are on a 1947-49 base period and use trade asso-
ciation and government data on physical volume capability as a capacity
measure. The weights used for combining the various output and capacity
indexes are based on value added data. The commodities included in this
index account for slightly more than 10 per cent of total industrial
production and for a somewhat greater share of its fluctuation. They
may be regarded as of strategic importance during a period of near
capacity operations, since their availability limits the potential out-
put of a large share of the remaining production. They include, in
addition to the textile, paper and primary metals series shown in
Chart 3, series on petroleum and coal products, cement and a few chemi-
cals.
In constructing these indexes, the definition of capacity is
arbitrary to some extent, but full capacity usually refers to "normal"
operations. The element of judgment involved in making these estimates
relates principally to determining the level of capacity rather than
the magnitude of change.
McGraw-Hill utilization rates
One of the questions included on the annual McGraw-Hill plant
and equipment survey is: "How much of your capacity were you operating
at the end of 19_?" These questionnaires are sent to a large number of
manufacturing companies. The responses are grouped on a weighted basis
into 15 (SIC 2-digit classification) industries and again weighted by
FRB value added weights to estimate a total manufacturing operating rate.
Summaries of these responses are available by industry since
1954 and show reasonable patterns over the cycle. The lack of any
definitition of capacity operation for respondents is a drawback, but
the survey does indicate businessmen's impressions as to their oper-
ating rates.

A -7
Changes in the operating rates for iron and steel for the past
three years are calculated on the basis of estimated net additions to
ingot capacity since 1960. No evaluation of over-all rolling mill
capacity has been made.
The combined FRB manufacturing measure
Capacity indexes (1957-59 output = 100) for total manufacturing
and for the durable and nondurable goods components were designed for
comparison with the manufacturing components of the FRB industrial produc-
tion index. Each is based on three sets of data: (1) the McGraw-Hill
capacity index (another question on the survey mentioned above asks for
per cent increases in "capacity" for the year); (2) the U.S. Department
of Commerce estimates of capital stock in manufacturing; and (3) the
FRB output index divided by the McGraw-Hill utilization rate discussed
above.
The course of each index is determined largely by (3) which is
assumed to fluctuate without any pronounced bias over time. Both series
(1) and (2) were assumed to have biases over time but, with allowance for
these biases, were used mainly after 1953, to smooth out irregularities
in (3). These measures are at best crude approximations of capacity and
are subject to wider margins of error than most aggregate time-series
commonly used in economic analysis.
