IN BROAD REVIEW
From this point forward, consideration of the course of
economic events in the near future can proceed without quite the
same attention to some of the earlier uncertainties associated with
the elections in the United Kingdom and the United States. Another
set of uncertainties--associated with labor contract negotiations in
the auto industry--is still in process of final resolution and any
current analysis of the significance of recent developments in the
economy must take account of the effect of the strike in many areas.
Industrial production, for example, will show a sharp decline in
October even though output in industries not affected has probably
continued to expand. Retail sales have been affected to a lesser
extent, with a slight decline in the total despite strength in markets
for many products. The household employment data, which do not
reflect the strike, show little change in October.
Private demands for cash balances and bank credit slackened
in October, no doubt reflecting in part the temporary slowing down
in the pace of economic expansion. Thus, the money supply after
increasing $800 million in the first half of the month, due largely
to a shift from government to private balances, decreased about half
a billion dollars in the last half. Total loans and investments at all
commercial banks probably declined a little over the month as a
whole. Public offerings of corporate bonds have also continued light,
though municipal offerings in the public market and corporate private
placements remain high.

I- 2
While reducing their rate of accumulation of demand deposits
and currency, individuals and businesses stepped up their accumulation
of savings in financial intermediaries. Thus time and savings deposit
growth at commercial banks was very high in October, as was growth in
savings and loan shareholdings in September, the latest month for
which data are available. This combination of somewhat reduced demands
for outside financing and availability for investment of an increased
volume of savings, together with more confident expectations as to
interest rate developments, has resulted in somewhat easier money
market conditions and stronger bond markets.
A large deficit in the balance of payments is indicated by
early and tentative data for October. The deficit for the month was
swollen by increased purchases of new foreign bond issues.
The British Government imposed late last month a 15 per cent
surcharge on imports as part of an effort to reduce Britain's large
balance of payments deficit. Since then, pressure on the pound in
foreign exchange markets has eased considerably.

General Motors, which consumes about 50 per cent of the steel
mill products shipped to the automotive industry, apparently has not
cancelled orders for steel originally scheduled for shipment in
October, but has extended shipping dates. Trade reports indicate
that supplying steel mills have continued to produce and inventory
these orders for General Motors. Steel ingot production has not
been adversely affected by the strike and has increased seasonally.
The chances for a full rebound of production in November
are clouded. General Motors' output will still be relatively low in
the first week of November as settlements at the plant-level are
not yet complete. Also, there is the possibility of a strike at
Ford if local settlements are not completed by the end of this week.
Prices. The daily index of raw industrial commodities has
risen further in recent weeks, reflecting chiefly additional increases
among nonferrous metals. However, the broader measures of prices--
for industrial commodities and for all commodities--have remained
relatively stable and the consumer price index has continued to rise
at the slow pace of recent years.
According to the latest monthly figures for mid-September,
the total wholesale price index and the major groupings for foodstuffs
and industrial commodities were stable from mid-August to mid-September.
The mid-September monthly indexes showed that of the 70 subgroups of
industrial commodities, 32 were unchanged from the month before, while
22 were up and 16 were down. Compared with last December, only 3
subgroups were unchanged, while 44 were up and 23 were down, but the
weighted average of all subgroups of industrial commodities was
unchanged.

II -3
Since mid-September, according to the weekly estimates,
the total index has continued to change little but stability in the
total has resulted from a moderate decrease in foodstuffs and a small
increase in industrial commodities. The rise shown for industrial
commodities--weekly estimates for which are based on a very small
sample of prices--reflects mainly recent further increases for lead,
zinc, and scrap metals and some seasonal recovery for petroleum
products.
Some of the price increases announced during the summer
had not been reflected in the BLS indexes by mid-September and
presumably did not actually go into effect. Specifically, the increases
announced by producers in July and August for paper bags, passenger
car tires, upholstered furniture, and some aluminum and stainless
steel products do not show up in the indexes. Since mid-September,
there have been announcements of price increases for other commodities,
including woodpulp, printing papers, and a few steel products,
but there is little evidence available yet to indicate the extent
to which recent announced increases are holding.
The monthly figures through mid-September show that prices
of machinery and equipment, on the average, have been stable since
July following a rise of about 1 per cent over the preceding year.
Compared with early 1963, prices are up about 4 per cent for metal-
working and construction equipment and 2 per cent for agricultural
equipment; transportation equipment is unchanged and the heavily
weighted electrical machinery group is down 1 per cent.

II -4
Much attention has been focussed in recent months on the
BLS daily index of raw industrial commodities, which is examined
closely for its predictive value with respect to the over-all stability
of the price level. This daily index is now up about 10 per cent from
mid-year and 20 per cent from the summer of last year. In this index,
which is an unweighted average of 13 commodities, the 5 metals have
risen an average of about a fourth since mid-year and nearly a half
since the summer of last year.
The rise in the daily index since last summer nearly
equals the rise that occurred in the two years after early 1954,
and the current level is almost as high as in early 1956. In the
1954-56 period, the broader Federal Reserve index of sensitive
industrial materials rose 15 per cent, compared with somewhat more
than 20 per cent for the daily index. Since early last year,
however, the Federal Reserve index has increased only 3 per cent
as against a 20 per cent rise in the daily index, reflecting the
selectivity of price increases in this period. While tin has
soared and all other nonferrous metals have increased substantially,
prices of lumber and plywood have been declining since spring, after
only a modest rise from a year earlier. Hides and rubber recently
have recovered moderately, but from very low levels. And in textile
markets, although demands are very strong and prices have increased
somewhat lately, average prices are no higher than in the spring
and summer of last year, in large part because of the decrease in
the cost of raw cotton through Federal payments to domestic users
and a reduction in the Federal support level.

II -5
On November 3, when the United States tin market was closed for
Election Day, tin prices on the London Metal Exchange dropped
sharply, following some earlier decline from the high reached October
30. In the United States also, tin prices had reached a record
high in late October--over $2.10 a pound compared with $1.16 in the
summer of 1963--despite the recent announcement by GSA that it will
increase the quantity of the metal available from the stockpile.
During the past 7 months, GSA has sold about 14,000 tons from an
original allocation of 23,300 for the year ending in March 1965.
To the 6,000 tons remaining to be sold over the next 5 months,
GSA has now added 18,000 tons. Thus, over the 12 months ending in
March 1965, GSA will have sold or made available a total of 38,000
tons, which may be appraised against estimated domestic consumption
in the first three quarters of 1964 at an annual rate of 75,603
tons. Of this amount, 53,330 was new tin and the remainder was from
scrap.
The consumer price index increased .2 per cent in
September to 108.4 per cent of the 1957-59 average and was 1.2
per cent above a year earlier. Rent was unchanged in September
and was less than 1 per cent above a year earlier. Average prices
of other services continued to rise at about a 2 per cent annual
rate, while price changes for commodities for the most part were
associated with seasonal developments. Thus, prices of apparel
increased as wool items returned to the market at higher levels
than last winter's end-of-season prices and new car prices declined

II -6
as dealers offered larger concessions in the closing month of the
1964 model year. Among foods, seasonal forces were outweighed by
the effect of the organized movement in late August and early September
to withhold livestock from markets. Retail prices of meats rose
nearly 3 per cent. Since early September wholesale prices of
livestock and meats have declined appreciably.
Labor market. The latest household survey--to be released
by the Department of Labor on Thursday, November 5--shows that the
labor force, employment and unemployment all showed little change
from September to October. These employment and unemployment figures
are not affected by the General Motors' strike.
Beginning in May the over-all unemployment rate has
fluctuated narrowly around a level of 5.1 per cent, following some
decline from the 5.7 level prevailing in 1963 and 1962.
In September and October, the unemployment rate for married
men, which had declined to a low of 2.6 per cent this summer, increased
to about 3.0 per cent--the same rate as a year earlier. Unemployment
rates for married men, while still relatively low in comparison with
rates for either group, have been consistently higher than the average
rate of 2.3 per cent in 1956. The increase of about one-fourth for
this group is almost the same as the increase in the total unemployment
rate. Among teenage youths unemployment continued at about 14 per cent
in September and October, about two-fifths above the 1956 rate.
Labor force and total employment have been relatively
stable since mid-year. While monthly changes may often be suspect,

II -7
for sampling and other statistical reasons, the relatively long
period with little change in employment lends support to other
evidence suggestive of a possible slow-down in employment gains in
industries other than the volatile metal manufacturing industries.
Industrial relations. Although General Motors reached a
national agreement with the auto workers union more than a week ago,
production and employment have been limited because 8 of the 133
local unions, including some at important assembly and body plants,
have not settled local issues and remain on strike. The company has
expressed hopes that settlements will be reached soon and that output--
now at 75 per cent of normal--will be resumed in full next week.
Meanwhile, 20 of Ford's 90 units have not signed local
contracts but continue to work. The union has set this Friday as
a deadline, and those units that have not concluded agreements by
then will be free to go on strike.
While both sides in the steel industry have stressed a
desire for an early settlement, there is little evidence that steps
have been taken to begin negotiations. Union demands remain rather
vague. Earlier it was thought that the union would stress money wage
increases this time because wage rates have not changed since 1961.
IIore recently, however, there have been reports that union members
seem more interested in an early retirement program similar to the
one in the auto industry than in large increases in pay scales.

II -8
Retail sales. Although the strike at General Motors sharply
limited production and sales of new model cars, 7eekly data through
October 24 indicate only a slight decline in total retail sales for
the month. Revised data for September show a decline of 0.4 per cent
from the August peak rather than the original 1.1 per cent.
Furniture and appliance sales, following a decline in
September, returned to the level prevailing since last spring. At
nondurable goods outlets, sales may have exceeded their August high,
with gains widespread among most types of business.
Auto sales. In September, before the effects of the General
Hotors' strike were evident, auto sales exceeded their level a year
earlier by about one-fifth, taking into account the earlier model
introductions this year. In the first 20 days of October, reflecting
strike effects, sales were down about one-fifth from last year.
The combined sales by Ford and Chrysler in the first 20
days of October were 9 per cent above their level last year. The
significance of this for interpreting the underlying strength of
demand, however, is limited. Aside from the effects of the strike
on households' current and expected incomes, some buyers may have
shifted their intended purchases to non-General Motors' cars while
others may have been holding off new car purchases until they could
compare all makes.
The 1964 model year, which closed just prior to the strike,
realized record sales of 8.1 million new autos--7.7 million domestically
produced, .4 million imported. This was the third model year in a
raw of marked increases in sales.

II -9
Accompanying rising sales there has been an increase in
estimated annual scrappage. The accompanying table shows total sales,
estimated acrappage, sales less scrappage, registered car stocks at
the beginning of the year, and the per cent increase during the model
year in cars on the road.

adjustments to model year basis--for cars on road. Extrapolations through
1963 and 1964 by actuarial analysis of survivor curves for all postwar
models.
These figures indicate that the number of autos on the road
has been increasing over the expansion period since 1961 at a rising
rate. The rate for the 1964 model year, however, was still well below
the exceptional rate of 1955. In the recent expansion period the number
of licensed drivers has grown at about 3.5 per cent a year, a higher
rate than in the mid-1950's.
Continued strength in auto sales is forecast by the Sindlinger
Survey sampling of six-month new car buying plans by telephone owning
households. Since mid-year buying plans have jumped to unprecedented
levels. Beginning in July, plans jumped from 8.0 to 8.5 per cent of
responding households, where they were in the first half of the year,

II -10
to 10 per cent in late September and early October. In early autumn
of 1963 the proportion was a little less than 9 per cent, which was
about the record up to that time.
Consumer credit. Demands for consumer credit were strong
in September according to a preliminary tabulation of commercial bank
data and scattered reports for other holder groups. At commercial banks,
instalment debt outstanding increased by about $235 million, compared
with a rise of just under $200 million in August.
The seasonally adjusted increase in instalment debt for all
holder groups probably amounted to about $500 million, up from $435
million in August. Such a pace for September would result in a third
quarter rate of rise about in line with the first half of the year:
higher than the second quarter but still below the record first quarter.
Delinquencies at commercial banks continue to be less than
1-1/2 per cent of all consumer loans made. The rate rose a little in the
third quarter, but was below the third quarter rate the year before,

The trend in delinquencies reported by GMAC has more or less
paralleled that shown by the commercial bank data, despite some tendency
toward slow pay-off on used car contracts. At CIT, on the other hand, the
delinquency rate has shown a slight but persistent increase throughout most
of this year.
Orders for durable goods. As is usual in a period of expanding
activity, new orders for durable goods have continued to exceed shipments and
order backlogs for durable goods increased appreciably further, to a level
at the end of September 12 per cent higher than at the end of 1963. The
September increase in unfilled orders reflected mainly gains in the steel
and machinery industries.
Beginning with April, new orders for durable goods have been
fluctuating around an average monthly level of about $20 billion, 10 per cent
above the corresponding period in 1963. In September, at $19.9 billion new
orders were close to this average and up 3 per cent from August.
As usual, defense orders have accounted for an important part
of recent fluctuations in new orders; thus they were up sharply in July,
taking total new orders to a peak of $21.3 billion, and in August and
September they were down sharply, to a level well below last spring.
New orders for primary metals have also fluctuated considerably
over this period but around a rising trend; a large increase in September--
presumably reflecting in part steel stocking by consumers fearful of a
strike--brought them to a new high for the year which equaled the peak
monthly level reached in the early 1963 steel inventory build-up.
New orders for machinery and equipment have been showing little
change in recent months at a level moderately below the highs reached in
May and June. These recent new order levels have been high enough, however,

so that despite a fairly steady advance in shipments, unfilled orders have
continued to increase--by 3.5 per cent from June to September as compared
with 8 per cent in the second quarter and 2.3 per cent in the first quarter.
Business inventories. For business as a whole, inventory changes
probably continued small in September and October, and total inventory
holdings continued at a low level in comparison with sales.
The pace of inventory accumulation has been stepped up at
manufacturers since midyear, owing in part to the beginning of a build-up
of steel stocks, but there has been a decline in distributors' stocks, which
in July and August about equaled the rise at manufacturers. A large part
of the distributor stock reduction reported for July and August came from
a decline in auto stocks as sales rose sharply; since then auto stocks have
been reduced further as a result of the General Motors'strike. On October 20
dealer stocks of new cars totaled 690,000 as compared with 785,000 a year
earlier.
The current reduced level of dealer auto stocks is clearly
involuntary. How far relatively low current levels of stocks in the hands
of other distributors reflect sales greater than anticipated and how far
they reflect other influences--cautious inventory policies and inventory
economies--is uncertain..
Manufacturers' inventories. Manufacturers' inventory
investment in September continued at about the stepped-up pace of
July and August, and the book value increase for the entie third quarter
totaled $550 million. This was moderately above manufacturers'
anticipations reported in the Commerce Department August survey and
about equal to the average quarterly rate for the year 1963.

II -13
The marked step-up in manufacturers' total inventory
accumulation from only $70 million in the second quarter to $550
million in the third reflected mainly a shift from moderate decline
to small rise in book value in the nondurable goods sector. Except
for foods, which showed another appreciable decline, most nondurable
industries were showing moderate inventory gains in the third quarter
following little change or small declines in the second. Perhaps
in part explaining these quarter-to-quarter differences in inventory
behavior, actual nondurable goods shipments in the third quarter turned
out about as anticipated (shipments were up 1 per cent from the
second quarter) while second quarter shipments--up 3 per cent from
the first--were well in excess of anticipation.
Durable goods inventories in September continued the steady--
though relatively moderate--gain that began last April after a few
months of little change at the beginning of the year. The book value
increase totaled $465 million in the third quarter and $415 million
in the second. (The average quarterly gain in 1963 was $425 million.)
Third quarter inventory investment was moderately above anticipations,
partly because third quarter shipments were moderately below those
expected. While inventories have increased in most durable industries
over recent months, the most pronounced gain in September--and the
third quarter--was in the machinery industries. Part of the recent
inventory increase reported for the machinery industry and other durable
industries as well has reflected some pick-up in stocks of steel and
other materials which had shown little change through the first half
of the year despite expanding production.

II -14
Construction activity. Construction expenditures edged down
in October to a seasonally adjusted rate of $65.5 billion. This was
slightly above the advanced rate a year ago and within 2 per cent of
the high reached earlier this year. Industrial and commercial building
continued to rise in October, but residential activity dropped further
and public construction also declined.
Residential building continues to be the one major area where
demand is clearly down from earlier highs of this expansion period.
Seasonally adjusted private housing starts did turn up in September,
but the rise was moderate and followed two months of decline. As a'
result, the average annual rate in the third quarter--l.47 million,
including farm--was down 6 per cent from the reduced second quarter
rate and 12 per cent from the high in the first quarter. In the first
nine months as a whole, starts were at an annual rate of 1.57 million,
just below the average for all of 1963, and a fifth above averages
for the (housing) recession year of 1960.
In contrast to starts, seasonally adjusted building permits
in permit-issuing areas declined in September but like starts they
were appreciably below a year earlier when both permits and starts
were near their recent peaks. Permits for multifamily units, which
had changed little in recent months, accounted for most of the decline
in September.

Rental vacancy rates rose somewhat in the third quarter to
an average of 7.7 per cent of units available and fit for use. As
in the second quarter, however, the average was little changed from
a year earlier and still moderately under the postwar peak (8.1
per cent) in the first half of 1961. Within metropolitan areas,
rates moved higher from the second to the third quarter, but this
appeared to be partly seasonal, and outside such areas, the average--
which had tended downward for more than two years--changed very little.
All regions except the South showed some rise; the increase in the
North Central States, however, was from a particularly low level.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL SITUATION
U. S. Government finance. The market for Treasury notes and
bonds strengthened during the last two weeks of October, and at month's
end average yields on long-term U. S. bonds were at their lowest levels
since early August. There were indications of some improvement in invest-
ment demand for Treasury coupon issues, notably for the longest maturi-
ties, and dealer positions in longer bonds declined about $15 million to
a level of $112 million between October 16 and October 30. However, the
market rally also reflected an expansion in the dealers own buying of
short- and intermediate-term issues, and their net holdings of notes and
bonds due in less than 10 years rose by $236 million in the last half of
October to a level of $664 million. In this period market participants
apparently came to feel that a change in System policy was not imminent,
particularly in view of the decision by the new U. K. Labor Government
to alleviate Britain's balance of payments problem through measures
other than an increase in interest rates and in view of continued evi-
dences of the moderate nature of developments in the domestic economy.

Treasury bill rates also edged lower in the latter part of
October. Market demand for bills was strong throughout most of October,
but tended to taper off late in the month. This late slackness was
made up by System purchases of nearly $540 million from dealers. In
addition, the new supply of bills from the October 20 auction of $1.5
billion March tax bills was largely absorbed by the commercial banks
because of the 50 per cent tax and loan credit allowed by the Treasury.
And in the last part of October dealers were able to finance their hold-
ings of bills and other securities at more attractive rates than earlier
in the month.
The Treasury announced a cash financing on October 28 involv-
ing about $9-1/4 billion of new 4 per cent notes due in 18 months. This
cash offering will refund about $8.7 billion of securities maturing
November 15 ($2.3 billion publicly held). As a result of the financing,
the Treasury cash position is likely to rise by almost $1 billion after
taking into account the saving on attrition and possible over-allotments
of the issue. The market reacted favorably to the 4 per cent rate,
and sizable interest on the part of banks has been reported. The
Treasury is expected to raise additional cash later in November through
an offering of perhaps $1.5 billion in June tax bills. With these new
funds, and with continued strong tax receipts, the Treasury may have
the flexibility to go through the balance of this year without further
cash borrowing, but the January cash drain will require additional funds.
Projections of cash receipts for all fiscal 1965 contained in
the Administration's recent budget review were substantially unchanged
from earlier estimates, after allowance for delay in enactment of the

III -3
tax cut. But the new projections lower expenditures by about $500 million
and leave the cash deficit for fiscal 1965, at $3.5 billion, some $1.2
billion below the fiscal 1964 deficit.

Within fiscal 1965, the staff still anticipates a larger than
usual swing from a deficit of almost $11 billion in July-December to a
surplus of about $7.5 billion in January-June. About two-thirds of the
swing is estimated as seasonal, so that the nonseasonal shift from
deficit to surplus would be around $5 billion this year, compared with
$1.2 billion last fiscal year. Thus, the new figures, while they contain
no great surprises, would if anything make it less likely that Federal
financing requirements will be exerting upward pressure on interest
rates over the next few quarters.

III -4
Corporate and municipal bond markets. Like the market for
U. S. Treasury securities, markets for corporate and municipal bondshave
developed a stronger tone recently, as investors have begun to view
the chance of a near-term rise in interest rates as less probable.
Although yields on high-quality seasoned issues in both markets have
remained stable, those on recently offered (unseasoned) issues have turned
down in secondary market trading. Yields on seasoned municipal bonds
of mixed quality have also declined several basis points. No current
reading of the series on new corporate bonds is available due to an
absence of offerings.

In the corporate bond market, the in~nediate technical position
of underwriters' changed quickly in the week following the British
election. At the time of the election five new issues were still in
syndicate, with unsold balances aggregating about $100 million. After
the Labor victory, four of these issues were released from syndicate,
apparently as a precautionary step against the possibility of a rise

III -5
in U.K. and U.S. interest rates stemming from expected action by
the new British government to defend the pound. Initially, yields
on these issues rose 2 to 7 basis points in secondary trading, but
when the specifics of the British program became evident, the bulk
of the yield advance was erased. The extremely light volume of
corporate bonds scheduled for public offering in November and December
was undoubtedly a factor also in this decline.
In the municipal market, new issue volume is expected to
decline over the remainder of the year, although the drop should be
no more than seasonal. Investor demand for current offerings of
municipal bonds has been good, and interest in older issues has picked
up. In consequence, dealers' advertised inventories have declined over
$100 million to about $575 million, the lowest level since late July.

at 85.18, only nominally below the peak. The generally favorable
reports of third quarter corporate earnings now becoming available
appear to have been largely discounted in the previous price rise.
Savings and loan associations. Preliminary data for September
indicate an expansion in savings capital at savings and loan associations
of more than $1 billion, almost one-sixth larger than in September a
year ago. This recent experience continues the general pick-up in
net savings flows that has been evident at all of the major depositary-
type institutions in recent months.
During the May-September period this year, savings capital
at savings and loan associations expanded $4.6 billion, $430 million
more than in the like period of 1963. This year-over-year expansion
offset about half of the short-fall that developed in the January-
April period, when net inflows of savings to savings and loan associations
were $861 million below the record growth of early 1963. Allowing
roughly for seasonal influences, the September and third quarter net
inflows seem to have regained the record proportions of early 1963.

1iortgage market developments. While competition for
mortgages has remained cuite intense this autumn, the FHA-yield series,
at 5.46 per cent in September, was virtually unchanged for the
eighteenth consecutive month. Contract interest rates for conventional
first mortgages also continued at earlier reduced levels--5.80 per
cent for loans on new homes and 5.85 per cent for loans on existing
houses, according to the Federal Housing Administration.
Reliance by private lenders on the secondary market facilities
of the Federal National 1lortgage Association has continued at low ebb
this year, in sharp contrast with developments in the spring of 1963
when, in response to private demands, sales by FNIA reached a monthly
rate of more than $165 million. The low level of activity since then
has reflected, in part, the ability of private investors to meet
portfolio requirements directly from the private market and, in part,
the higher prices to purchasers which FNIA established early in 1963.
A public offering of $300 million FNMA participation certificates--
backed by a pool of mortgages held by FNEA and the Veterans'
Administration--was successfully marketed by underwriters in October
under authority of the recently passed Housing Act of 1964. Hovever,
these certificates are designed to attract funds not usually directly
involved in FNMA's regular secondary market operations.

III -8
Bank credit. Loans and investments at city banks declined over
$2 billion in the three weeks ending October 21, somewhat more than in
the corresponding weeks last year, and much more than in 1962. A sub-
stantial rise is expected for the week of October 28, however, reflect-
ing initial allotments to banks of nearly all the $1.5 billion of March
tax bills, for which 50 per cent of the payment was permitted through
credit to tax and loan accounts.
For the month as a whole, seasonally adjusted total credit at
all commercial banks may show a small decline. This includes an estimated
large rise at nonweekly reporting banks, data on which are available' for
only the first half of the month. A reduction in holdings of U. S. Gov-
ernment securities, following large increases in the previous two months,
may more than offset moderate increases in loans and holdings of murnci-
pal and agency issues. From midyear through October, total commercial
bank credit is estimated to have increased at an annual rate of about
6 per cent compared with 8 per cent over the first half of the year.

About half the city bank credit decline over the first three
weeks of October was in holdings of U. S. Government securities. Banks
made large reductions in holdings of bills following heavy acquisitions
in September, and they continued to reduce their holdings of notes and
bonds maturing in over 5 years. Purchases of municipal and agency issues,
which had picked up in August and September, moderated in October.
Business loans at city banks declined somewhat over the first
three weeks of October compared with increases in the corresponding
period of most other recent years. This followed record expansion at
these banks in September, however. At all commercial banks, based on
recently revised seasonal factors, business loans increased $600 million
in September, somewhat more than the substantial increases of the late
spring and summer months. In October, however, growth probably was
considerably smaller.
Since the September tax period, continuing strong loan demand
has been confined mainly to the petroleum and checmicals group. In addi-
tion, loans to metals companies have not shown the usual post-tax period
decline, presumably reflecting in part accumulation of steel inventory.
But in several other major categories, particularly public utilities,
trade, and miscellaneous manufacturing, where loans earlier had been
expanding, loan demand appears to have moderated recently, after allowance
is made for usual seasonal movements. In public utilities, a substantial
volume of bank debt has been refinanced in the capital markets and in
trade, some liquidation of auto-floor plan loans probably resulted from
the General Motors' strike. Outstanding loans to the textiles-apparel

III -10
group have been declining more than seasonally, possibly reflecting to
some extent improved cash flow from the 6-1/2 cents per pound reduction
in the cost of raw cotton which was authorized earlier this year.
In October, real estate and consumer loans appear to have
increased at about the same relatively rapid rate as in other recent
months. Security loans, both to U. S. Government security dealers and
to others, declined substantially.
Money supply and time deposits. The seasonally adjusted money
supply increased $500 million further in October (preliminary) with sub-
stantial growth early in the month offset in part by a subsequent decline.
Since May, when money growth began to accelerate, the money supply has
increased at an annual rate of 6.2 per cent compared with 2.0 per cent
earlier in the year. During the last 3 months, however, the rise has
fallen to 4.6 per cent, and for the year to date it has been 4.2 per cent.
U. S. Government deposits at commercial banks showed a sizable seasonally
adjusted decline in October.
Seasonally adjusted time and savings deposits at all commercial
banks increased $1.3 billion in October (preliminary) or at a little
faster pace than in other recent months. The annual rate of expansion
in these deposits since June--11.4 per cent--has been slightly higher
than that in the first six months of the year, 11 per cent.
The rate of growth in savings deposits at banks in leading
cities has accelerated in the last couple of months relative to last
year's expansion. Since July, growth in these deposits has been some-
what larger than that in the corresponding weeks of 1963 whereas in
earlier months of 1964, it had been only three-fifths as much. Time

III -11
deposits, which had declined somewhat in both September 1964 and 1963,
associated principally with maturing CD's over the tax period, increased
substantially in early October of both years. By October 21, CD's at
banks in New York and Chicago were above their pre-tax period levels
but at other city banks they were still somewhat below.
Bank reserves. Free reserves at all member banks averaged $84
million in October, about the same as in September, but below the $120
1/million level prevailing earlier in the year.- Excess reserves at
$389 million were below the September average but about the same as in
previous months, while member bank borrowings at $305 million were higher
than the average of other recent months. During October (through the 28th)
the effective rate on Federal funds fell below 3-1/2 per cent on five
days, with some transactions at lower rates on 10 days and some at
higher rates on 7 days.
Seasonally adjusted required reserves against private demand
deposits increased moderately further during October as a sharp rise
early in the month was offset only in part by a subsequent decline.
Required reserves against U. S. Government deposits declined consider-
ably more than usual.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
U.S. Balance of Payments. The tentative data presently avail-
able show an over-all payments deficit for October of about $600 million.
This figure, if confirmed by later data, is about as large as the
deficit figure for October 1963, As then, one element in the increased
deficit for the month as compared with September, appears to have been
outflows of short-term capital into U.S. dollar deposits with Canadian
banks seeking to build up published balance sheet totals.
The other major element in the larger deficit in October this
year is that the outflow of long-term capital on new foreign bond issues
has picked up in the fourth quarter, after having been small in the
third. For the period July through November, this outflow now appears
likely to exceed $500 million, compared with about $400 million in the
first half of the year. Most of the borrowing since midyear has been
for Canadian account, but one-fifth of the outflow reflects an issue
by the Inter-American Development Bank, The IDB will place most of
the proceeds in long-term bank deposits; such deposit holdings are
regarded as long-term capital inflows in the U.S. balance of payments
accounts, and the IDB issue will thus add little to the over-all
payments deficit for the time being.
Long-term bank loans to foreigners rose substantially in
September, bringing the third quarter outflow to almost $250 million,
as compared to an exceptionally low $80 million in the second quarter.
For the second and third quarters together, the outflow of these
loans this year was up 10 per cent from 1963, There was a small net
inflow of U.S. short-term capital reported by banks in September.

IV -2
U.S. exports in September increased by more than $2 billion
at a seasonally adjusted annual rate. However, much of this sharp
increase was probably due to an acceleration of export shipments in
anticipation of a port strike in October. There were reports in the
last week of September indicating unusually high levels of port
activity. In 1962, when a similar development occurred, it appeared
in retrospect that about 10 per cent of total shipments were shifted
from October to September. If the same proportion of total exports
were affected this year, the adjusted rate of exports in September
would not be greatly different from that of preceding months -- that
is, around 24-1/2 billion at an annual rate.
Imports in September were slightly lower than in August,
but remained above the advanced second quarter levels. Anticipations
of a port strike presumably did not affect September imports, as in
1962.
Shifts in the timing of physical movement of exports and
imports as a result of the threatened port strike are unlikely to have
had any appreciable effect on the flows of payments associated with
the movement of these goods. Statistics on the over-all payments
balance in September and October would not have been significantly
affected.
The new British surcharges on imports can be expected to
have a noticeable effect on U.S. exports. Since early this year,
U.S. exports to the United Kingdom have averaged $1.5 billion at a

IV -3
seasonally adjusted annual rate. Almost half of the total -- about
$700 million annually -- will be subject to the surcharge; these
exports -- mainly capital equipment and other manufactures -- have
increased by about 50 per cent in the last four years, as shown in the
accompanying chart, in contrast to the declines in foodstuffs, tobacco,
and other raw materials.
Business and financial developments abroad, The new Labor
Government's short-run proposals for dealing with Britain's payments
problems have, at least temporarily, lessened the pressure on the pound,
Before the announcement of the British measures, uncertainty about
intermediate-run business prospects was increasing in France; whereas
in Germany, growth of domestic demand and capacity was continuing.
In Britain the new Labor Government announced on October 26
its program for dealing with the continuing large deficits in the
British balance of payments. Just prior to the announcement, and after
a widely anticipated increase in the Bank Rate failed to materialize,
the pound came under heavy selling pressure in London. Following the
announcement of the Government program, speculation against sterling
came to a halt, and sterling has risen over the past week. On
November 4, the spot pound was quoted at $2.7847, up22 points from
its low of $2.7825 on October 23.
The Government's short-run measures for lessening the trade
deficit included (1) a 15 per cent surcharge on all imports except food,
unmanufactured tobacco and raw materials, and (2) partial rebates of

IV -4
indirect taxes paid by exporters, averaging about 1-1/2 per cent of the
value of the exports. The import surcharge would affect imports which
in 1963 were valued at about $4 billion out of total imports of $13-1/2
billion. Most heavily affected by the import surtax will be exporters
of manufactures in Europe and North America; only a small proportion
of exports to the U.K. from Commonwealth and other nonindustrial
countries are involved.
The immediate impact of the import surcharge may be quite
large inasmuch as considerable uncertainty exists as to the duration
of its application. Pressure from other European governments for the
early removal of the surcharge has already begun to mount, but no
retaliatory measures appear so far to be in prospect. A crude estimate
would be that declines in imports as a result of the surcharge would
not reduce the annual rate of the payments deficit -currently 1700-800
million -- by more than 25-35 per cent at the maximum.
Most recent figures on the British economy indicate continued
sluggishness of output gains and poor export performance. The index of
industrial production for August, seasonally adjusted, was again un-
changed at 127 per cent of the 1958 average. New orders in engineering
industries in July and August declined from record second quarter levels
and were about the same as in the second half of 1963. The labor market
remains tight, with unemployment continuing through October to
fluctuate around 1-1/2 per cent of the labor force.
The third quarter seasonally adjusted trade deficit on a
balance of payments basis was 1150 million, compared with a deficit for

IV -5
the second quarter of L113 million. Imports increased further, while
there was virtually no change in exports.
There are increasing signs of a slowing or cessation of the
expansion of French economic activity. Slowdowns in production in the
auto and allied industries have continued. Although analysts believe
that industrial output will at least be maintained at present levels
through the end of this year, increasing concern has been reported about
the possibility of a downturn in 1965. Increases in new orders have
apparently continued to slacken and the squeeze on profits is continuing.
The seasonally adjusted index of industrial production for
July-August combined was down about 6 per cent from June, reportedly
because the seasonal adjustment does not yet take into account the
longer paid vacations granted by more and more industries over the last
two years. Output in September is thought to have returned to the June
level, but in that month it was no higher than in early spring.
Seasonally adjusted trade data for Germany show both imports
and exports in September returning to about their July levels. For
the third quarter as a whole, the trade surplus fell to $188 million
from $525 million in the second quarter, mainly because of a higher
level of imports.
In Canada, the index of industrial production rose nearly 2
per cent in August, returning to the record level reached last April.
Although total retail sales in August, seasonally adjusted, were
unchanged from the July level, new automobile sales rose about 3

IV -6
per cent. Seasonally adjusted unemployment continue to decline
through mid-September, and at 4.5 per cent of the labor force was 0.7
percentage points below the mid-June rate.
While construction activity continued to fall in August, new
construction may be expected to pick up soon: new building permits rose
15 per cent from May to August, and the winter building bonus of $500 per
house again came into effect on November 4, providing added building
incentives for the next several months.
There has been a good deal of demand for the Canadian dollar
in the foreign exchange market, primarily as the result of the conversion
of the proceeds of Canadian security issues in the New York market.
Official reserves have increased over the last month as a result of
intervention by the Bank of Canada to moderate the rise in the Canadian
exchange rate.
The seasonally adjusted Japanese trade deficit widened to $94
million in September as compared to an average monthly deficit of $50
million in July-August. Imports rose by 8 per cent while exports remained
at approximately the same level as in the previous three months.
Wholesale prices continued to move upward for the third
consecutive month in September, rising 0.4 per cent. Previously, the
index had fallen 1.4 per cent, from a peak in November of 1963 to a low
in June of this year,
