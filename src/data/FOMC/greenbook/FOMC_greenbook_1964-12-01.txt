of Governors of the Federal Reserve Syst em.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization proce ss which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain.

I- 1
IN BROAD REVIE7T
Attention of economic and financial observers is naturally cen-
tered on the abrupt British bank rate increase and the upward adjustment
of Federal Reserve discount rates. Federal Reserve actions, in raising
the discount rate and also in raising interest ceilings member banks are
permitted to pay on time and savings deposits, were accepted by most market
and other observers as a reasonable response to the situation and immediate
price reactions in bond, stock, and commodity markets were generally mild.
Three-month Treasury bill rates responded promptly and more posi-
tively to the rate actions. On Tuesday, the 3-month bill closed at 3.80 per
cent, but prior to that had remained in the 3.44-3.60 per cent range for
several weeks. Longer-term Treasury yields reached new lows for the year
around mid-November and have risen only moderately since the British and
U.S. actions.
Meanwhile, the domestic economic and financial situation appar-
ently has continued strong, although the underlying situation has been
obscured by strikes, particularly in the auto industry, and by hedging
against a possible steel strike next year. Industrial production in Novem-
ber will apparently recover from the effects of the GM strike and slightly
exceed the September level. New housing starts in October rose from the
reduced rate of other recent months. Retail sales in early November were
still limited by reduced auto stocks and, also, by unseasonably warm
weather.
Industrial prices in mid-November appeared to have changed little
from the mid-October level, which, however, had risen slightly above the

I -2
narrow range prevailing from December through September. Price increases
were still selective and largely centered in nonferrous and other metals;
price decreases were reported for a few industrial products as well as for
certain foodstuffs.
In government, corporate and municipal securities markets, yields
had declined from late October to mid-November. Stock market prices,
already at an advanced level, held within a narrow range from mid-October
to mid-November when they rose again to a new high just before the bank
and discount rate actions. Since then they have declined slightly.
The volume of long-term financing continued moderate for munici-
pal issues and light for corporate issues in November and the calendar for
December does not suggest significant upward pressure on bond yields.
Mortgage credit has continued inample supply with terms about unchanged
from those in other recent months.
Bank credit expansion in the first half of November was large
at city banks following a sizable decline at all commercial banks in
October. During the first 10 months of this year, bank credit expansion
was at an annual rate of 7 per cent as compared with 8 per cent for the
whole year 1963.
The seasonally adjusted money supply increased substantially
in the first half of November following a decline in the second half of
October. The annual rate of money supply growth so far this year is
4.2 per cent, with expansion since the June-July bulge at 4.7 per cent
annual rate. Seasonally adjusted time and savings deposits also increased
substantially in early November and the annual rate so far this year has
been close to 12 per cent.

I -3
Free reserves, which had been averaging close to $90 million for
some time, became slightly negative in the first three weeks of November.
The deficit in the balance of payments has been large so far in
the fourth quarter. In addition to the increase in new foreign security
issues, the large deficit figures have reflected heavy movements of other
funds to Canada, some of which may be reversed in December. Large deficits
have usually been recorded in October and November followed by a surplus in
December.
The Group of Ten countries plus Austria and the BIS moved on
November 25 to provide $3 billion in assistance to Britain for defense of
the pound sterling, after the November 23 increase in British Bank Rate
from 5 to 7 per cent failed to halt massive speculative pressures. As part
of this assistance, which is in addition to the $1 billion standby with the
IMF, the System swap arrangement has been increased to $750 million and the
Export-Import Bank has made available a $250 million line of credit.
Because of the Holiday, the Supplement to the
Green Book will be included in the regular
Monday distribution of FOMC materials.

THE DOMESTIC ECONOMY
Industrial production. The industrial production index in
November is now estimated to have increased about 2-1/2 points from
the reduced October level, probably reaching somewhat above the
September figure of 134.0. The increase, mainly due to the return of
General Motors to full scale operations, was somewhat dampened by the
strike at Ford. Net production gains in autos, trucks, and parts
amounted to about 2 points in the total index. While data are not yet
available, it is anticipated that output of consumer goods, business
equipment, and materials other than automotive, continued to increase
in November.
In September and October, production losses in the motor
vehicle and related industries amounted to 3-1/2 points in the total
index. However, output of final products and materials other than
automotive continued to rise and the total index declined only 2 points.
Despite the effects of the auto strike, over-all output so
far this year is estimated to have increased 6 per cent as compared with
a rise of 5 per cent from 1962 to 1963 and a rise of nearly 8 per cent
from 1961 to 1962. As the following table shows, the estimated
increases for the major market groupings so far this year have been
more varied than they were from 1962 to 1963. For consumer goods, the
indicated rise is about the same as last year while for business
equipment the rise is considerably larger,

Prices. As foreshadowed by the weekly estimates of wholesale
prices, the industrial commodity index rose between mid-September and
mid-October. The industrial index was 101.1 per cent of the 1957-59,
average in October compared with 100.7 in September and a range of 100.7
to 100.9 in the whole period from last December through September.
The weekly estimates suggest little further change since mid-October.
A reversal in prices of petroleum products accounted for
a fourth of the October rise in the industrial average; refined products
rose 2-1/2 per cent from a September level that was down more than
5 per cent from last autumn. Another fourth of the rise was accounted
for by a further rise in prices of nonferrous metals. Increases in
primary refined copper and in copper products were reflected in a rise
of 3 per cent in the nonferrous group to a level 12-1/2 per cent higher
than early last year. The balance of the October rise in the industrial
index was accounted for by previously announced increases for woodpulp
and some paper products and by scattered increases among chemicals
and general purpose machinery. Few decreases were recorded other than
slight further declines for lumber and plywood.

II -3
Although the weekly estimates indicate a further rise of only
.1 per cent in the industrial average since mid-October, increases have
been announced for batteries, following earlier advances in lead,
and for primary aluminum and aluminum mill products. Tin prices have
dropped about 10 per cent from the extraordinary high reached at the
end of October, and one Canadian and two American producers of newsprint
have cut prices 7-1/2 per cent for delivery in the western part of the
U.S. Substantial reductions have been announced for some plastic materials.
Wholesale prices of foodstuffs declined 1 per cent in October,
reflecting decreases for livestock and products in response to expansion
in supplies that was mainly seasonal, and they have declined somewhat
further since then. The wholesale price index for all commodities,
therefore, remained relatively stable through October and the first
half of November.
Gross national product. Gross national product in the third
quarter is now estimated by the Department of Commerce at an annual rate
of $628.4 billion, nearly $10 billion higher than in the second quarter.
A feature of this expansion was a very large increase in consumer spending.
Business spending for fixed capital, net exports, and State and local
government purchases were also strongly expansive. Inventory investment,
Federal purchases, and residential construction were lower than in the
preceding quarter.
The GNP estimate for the third quarter is $1 billion higher
than the preliminary one published last month. Inventory investment,

II -4
with book value data available for the entire quarter, is now indicated
to be at an annual rate of $2.8 billion instead of $1.7 billion; net
exports, with September data in, are estimated at $7.0 billion rather
than $6.5; and Federal defense expenditures are reported to have been
$.5 billion below the earlier estimates.
Present estimates indicate that there has been no significant
change in the rate of increase in GNP, in either current or constant
dollars since late 1963. In current dollars, the third quarter level
was 7.0 per cent above a year earlier and in constant dollars the
increase was 5.0 per cent. The relative gains for the full year 1964
over the year 1963 are likely to be similar to those for the third
quarter.

1964 -I 608.8 508.0
II 618.6 513.5
III 628.4 519.6
Data on Federal tax receipts only recently available indicate
that earlier Commerce estimates of personal Federal tax payments for
the second and third quarters were too low. (See Appendix A)
Accordingly, the estimate for the second quarter has been revised up
by $1.2 billion (annual rate) to $47.3 billion and the estimate for
the third quarter has been revised up by $1.3 billion to $48.2 billion.

II -5
These new Commerce estimates are virtually the same as those contained
in the GNP projection presented to the Federal Open Market Committee
about six weeks ago.
Reflecting these revisions in tax payments, personal saving
has been lowered. The personal saving rate is now reported at 7.9
per cent for the second quarter and 7.1 per cent in the third quarter,
and compares with the previously published figures of 8.2 per cent
and 7.4 per cent. The revision in tax payments also was reflected in
larger estimates of Federal Government receipts on a GNP basis and a
reduction in the deficit. The deficit is now estimated to have been
at an annual rate of $7.8 billion in the second quarter, instead of
$9.0 billion, and $5.2 billion in the third quarter, instead of $6.2
billion.
Residential building. Seasonally adjusted private housing
starts, which had been at a reduced rate in recent months, recovered
sharply in October, advancing to the highest rate since June. The
rate was still well below October 1963, when starts also rose
appreciably to their recent peak. On a three-month moving average
basis, starts in the August-October period were at an annual rate of
1.5 million, moderately above the July-September average.
Seasonally adjusted residential building permits in
permit-issuing areas showed a slight rise in October, reflecting
mainly some recovery in permits for multifamily structures which had
declined nearly a tenth in September.

Orders for durable goods. New orders received by manufacturers
of durable goods declined 4.5 per cent in October because of the General
Motors' strike, which lowered the order level for the auto industry
nearly 30 per cent. Outside the auto industry, total new orders were
maintained at about the September rate.
Despite a decline for machine tools, total new orders for
machinery and equipment were moderately larger in October; however,
they were still 3 per cent below the May-June peak. Defense orders
were up somewhat but remained well below earlier highs. October orders
for primary metals were close to the advanced September level and,
except for September, were the highest since April 1963, the peak of
that steel stock-building episode.
Shipments also were sharply curtailed in the auto industry
in October and generally maintained for other durable goods. Unfilled
orders rose considerably further--as in September the rise was con-
centrated in metals and nonelectrical machinery and equipment--and at
the end of the month the durable order backlog was 13 per cent larger
than at the end of last year,

II -7
Retail sales. Seasonally adjusted retail sales in October
declined 3 per cent as a result of a reduction of 25 per cent for the
automotive group, because of the General Motors' strike. Excluding
auto sales in both months, retail sales advanced 2.7 per cent from
September to October.
In October, furniture and appliance sales recovered from
their reduced September level and reached a new high; sales in October
were some 5 per cent above the third quarter monthly average.
Nondurable goods sales attained a new high in October, up 2.4 per cent
after a slight hesitation in September, and exceeded their third quarter
average by nearly 2 per cent.
Total sales in early November (based on data through November
14), were off from their reduced October level, with declines indicated
at both durable and nondurable goods outlets. Among durables, lower
auto sales reflected the continued short supply caused by the recent
strikes; sales at furniture and appliance stores were down from their
record October level. Nondurable goods were off moderately in the
first half of November with declines registered among most categories.
Continued unseasonally warm weather across most of the nation probably
limited sales at apparel and general merchandise outlets.
On a unit basis, total sales of new domestic autos in the
first ten days of November were a fourth less than a year earlier,
although sales by Ford and Chrysler alone were a fifth higher and
up more than seasonally. In October Ford and Chrysler sales had been
nine per cent above last year. As a result of the General Motors'

II -8
strike, stocks of new domestic cars in early November were ten pet cent
below a year earlier.
Foreign cars have participated in the record auto sales
this year. Seasonally adjusted sales of imported cars in the third
quarter were at an annual rate of 486,000 cars, 29 per cent above a
year earlier and the highest in six years.
Consumer credit. Demands for consumer credit were strong in
September but weakened in October when auto sales were down sharply.
In September, instalment debt rose $513 million after seasonal adjustment,
one of the largest monthly increases this year. Data available for
October are incomplete but they suggest a substantial decline from
the September rate of expansion, to around the $430 million level.
As the table below indicates, this would make October one of the
slackest months of the year in the use of credit by consumers.

While much of the slowdown in October was due to the strike-
reduced level of auto sales, it seems likely that personal loan volume
in October was off from September's high level. The net increase in
personal loans in September was the largest in almost a year and
apparently reflected an upsurge in borrowing for educational and
travel purposes.
Borrowing to finance the purchase of consumer goods other
than autos and for home repair and modernization apparently continued to
increase in October. The net change in such borrowing was probably
little different than in September.
Third quarter figures are now available showing the proportion
of consumer after-tax income committed to payments on instalment debt.
This ratio was 14 per cent, unchanged from the first and second quarters.
The ratio had been trending up in 1962 and 1963, however, so it probably
would have edged up further had it not been for the sharp rise in
disposable income following the tax cut.
Personal income. Personal income rose $700 million in October
to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $499 billion. The rise was
limited by strikes in the automotive industry and was the smallest
in more than eighteen months. The level of personal income in October
was 5.5 per cent higher than a year earlier, as compared with year-over-
year increases averaging 6.0 per cent from March to September.
The October loss of wages and salaries because of the strikes,
estimated at about $1-1/2 billion (annual rate), was only a little more

II -10
than offset by widespread payroll gains in other industries. Government
payrolls were up $600 million, with half of that amount consisting of
retroactive payments under the Federal civilian pay increase enacted
earlier. Small gains occurred in business proprietors' income, rental
income, interest, and transfer payments.
Labor market. Total nonfarm payroll employment was little
changed at 59.0 million in October, as gains in nonmanufacturing
activities largely offset a decline of about 250,000 in the strike-
affected manufacturing sector. Within manufacturing, the sharpest drop
occurred in transportation equipment, but the effects of the automobile
strike were also felt in the fabricated metals industries. Employment
in most other durable and nondurable goods industries showed little
change.
Nonmanufacturing employment rose by 185,000, somewhat more
than 150 in October 1963. In both periods strong gains in State and
local governments, reflecting the hiring of teachers for the new
school term, accounted for most of the rise. Employment in the trade
and service industries rose moderately.
Full- and part-time labor force. The relatively more rapid
growth of part-time than full-time jobs has been an outstanding
feature of postuar labor market developments and the past year has
been no exception. Part-time positions accounted for more than 1
in 4 of the 1.5 million new jobs added on the average from the first
10 months of 1963 to the corresponding period of 1964. In contrast,
only 1 in 8 workers are employed part-time.

II -11
Growth in part-time jobs reflects an increasing number of
women and younger workers in the labor force. Teenagers alone
accounted for more than half the increase in part-time employment
in 1964 and these jobs provided almost all the employment gain reported
among younger workers.

A very high proportion--almost two-thirds--of the young
workers has been looking for full-time jobs. The unemployment rate for
these was substantially higher than for part-time job seekers. Lack
of experience and limited skills are apparently much greater handicaps
for young workers looking for full-time jobs than for those seeking
part-time work. In the period ahead, growth in the number of young
workers in the labor force will continue to be mostly among those
seeking full-time jobs.

Hours and earnings. The seasonally adjusted factory workweek
in October remained unchanged at 43.6 hours, continuing at the level
prevailing since early this year. A slight decline in the durable goods
sector was offset by a recovery in nondurable goods industries from a
dip in September when some workers took unpaid vacations over the Labor
Day holiday.
Hourly and weekly factory earnings were down in October mainly
because of the curtailment in the high-wage transportation equipment and
metalworking industries. At $2.53, hourly earnings were down 3 cents
from September, and were only slightly more than 2 per cent higher than
a year ago. Weekly earnings declined by about $1 to $103, and were also
2 per cent above a year earlier.
About 2.3 million workers were affected by collective bargaining
settlements in the first 9 months of 1964. Of these about half were in
manufacturing, and for these workers the straight-time hourly wage
increase averaged 2.5 per cent. Included were more than 200,000 workers
at Ford and Chrysler wh6 received no immediate money wage increases.
Also included were the meat packing and petroleum workers whose contracts
were negotiated in the third quarter. In nonmanufacturing industries,
collectively bargained wage rate increases were somewhat larger--
averaging 3.1 per cent. Miost of these workers were in trucking but
some were in the telephone, coal mining and railroad industries. These
data refer only to changes in wage rates and exclude the value of
supplementary benefits. These benefits have been rising relatively
more rapidly than straight-time earnings.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL SITUATION
Bank credit. The $650 million increasd in total credit at
city banks over the two weeks ending November 11 was relatively large
even allowing for the Treasury bill refinancing that took place during
the period, but was smaller than last year when a new one-year bill
was issued. This was followed by a larger-than-usual rise at banks in
New York and Chicago in the subsequent week, when banks acquired new
18-month Treasury notes. All commercial banks were allotted an
estimated $1.5 billion of this issue whereas they held about $1
billinn of the maturing issues. Bank acquisitions of governments,
net, in the mid-November financings were generally similar to those
of earlier years.

Nonbank financial
The substantial early November rise in bank credit was due
mainly to a larger-than-usual increase in loans, totaling over $1.1
billion, associated principally with borrowing by Government security
dealers and also with a pickup in business loan demand following the

III -2
October lull and somewhat larger than usual borrowing by nonbank financial
institutions. Bank holdings of both U.S. Government and other securities
declined, but less than in the corresponding weeks of most other recent
years. Most of the reduction in governments was in Treasury bills but
holdings of bonds maturing in more than five years also continued to
decline.
The substantial credit expansion at city banks in early
November followed a $900 million seasonally adjusted decline in total
credit at all commercial banks in October. Over the first ten months of
the year, credit increased at an annual rate of 7 per cent, slightly'
below the 8 per cent rise in the full year 1963. Loan expansion was
similar in the two years as was the reduction in holdings of U.S.
Government securities, but growth in holdings of municipal and agency
issues has slackened materially this year.
Loans to U.S. Government security dealers increased sharply
over the first two weeks of November, reflecting principally dealers'
needs to carry increased trading positions and to refinance maturing
repurchase agreements with nonfinancial corporations which needed funds
over the November 1 excise tax date. This was followed by moderate loan
repayments by security dealers to New York City banks in the week of
November 18. Loans to finance companies also increased in early
November, by a little more than in the comparable weeks of past years.
In October, these loans had not shown the usual tax period decline.
Business loans at city banks increased $430 million over the
two weeks ending November 11, reflecting in part borrowing in connection

III -3
with large excise tax payments on November 1. This increase was
considerably more than in the corresponding weeks of other recent years,
except for the unusually sharp rise in 1963, and was followed by a
large further rise at New York City banks in the week of November 18.
In October, growth in business loans had slackened; the seasonally
adjusted rise of $200 million at all commercial banks was one of the
smallest of the year, but followed a period of accelerated growth
beginning in the spring. Smaller borrowing in October may have reflected,
in part, a reaction from earlier anticipatory borrowing, as well as the
effects of the GM strike.
In early November, borrowing by food processors and commodity
dealers was larger than usual, presumably reflecting almost complete
reliance on direct bank financing instead of the customary partial use
of acceptance financing which is now more costly than direct financing.
Loans to petroleum and chemicals companies continued relatively strong
and those to the metals and trade groups increased after a sharp post-
September tax period decline. Repayments by public utilities continued
heavy and those by textile and apparel concerns were larger than seasonal.
Deposits and turnover. The seasonally adjusted money supply
increased $800 million (preliminary) in the first half of November
following a $650 million decline in the last half of October. The annual
rate of growth since the June-July bulge has been 4.7 per cent, not much
above the 4.2 per cent rate so far this year. Relatively slow growth
early in the year was offset by the unusually sharv June-July expansion.
U.S. Government deposits at commercial banks rose slightly in the first
half of November, although in most past years they had declined.

III -4
Demand deposit turnover at 343 centers outside New York increased
to 35.5 in October from 35.1 in September. Since the April high of 36.0,
turnover has fluctuated between 35 and 36. Over the first ten months
of 1964, turnover averaged 5.4 per cent above the corresponding months
last year; early in the year it was 6.7 per cent higher but since April
only 4.5 per cent.
Seasonally adjusted time and savings deposits at all commercial
banks increased $900 million (preliminary) in the first half of Noveiber,
or at a little faster pace than the accelerated October expansion.
For the year through mid-November, these deposits have increased at an
annual rate close to 12 per cent. At banks in leading cities,
expansion in savings deposits in the first two weeks of November continued
to exceed that of the corresponding weeks last year, as had been the
case over the August-October period. Earlier in 1964, growth in savings
deposits had been much smaller than in 1963. In addition, the reduction
in other time deposits was smaller this year than last.
Pay-out of Christmas Club funds was offset in part by further
increases in CD's. At banks in New York and Chicago, where comparable
data are available, CD's increased much more than in the corresponding
two weeks last year. At banks in other leading cities, however, CD's
declined in early November.
Accompanying the increase in the discount rate, and also
effective November 24, the Board of Governors set the maximum rate
on savings deposits at 4 per cent regardless of the time the funds are
on deposit and raised the maximum rates on time deposits and certificates

III -5
of deposit to 4 per cent for maturities of less than 90 days from the
previous 1 per cent, and to 4-1/2 per cent for all longer maturities
from the previous 4 per cent.
Bank reserves. Free reserves averaged $20 million in the
week of November 18 following two weeks in which the free reserves
figures initially reported were revised to net borrowed reserves. Over
the three weeks as a whole, net borrowed reserves averaged about $23
million compared with free reserves close to $90 million in each of the
1/previous months.- Borrowings at all member banks rose sharply to an
average of $500 million during the three weeks ending November 18
compared with $325 million over September and October. Excess reserves
also rose somewhat to a $475 million average.
The effective rate on Federal funds was 3-5/8 per cent on
three days during the October 29-November 18 period and was never below
3-1/2 per cent. Transactions took place generally in the 3-1/2-3-5/8
per cent range although on one day there was some trading at 2-1/2
per cent.
Seasonally adjusted required reserves against private demand
deposits increased moderately further over the first three reporting
weeks of November as a substantial increase early in the period was
offset only in part by subsequent declines.

U.S. Government finance. The U.S. Government securities
market reacted rather sharply but in an orderly fashion to the announce-
ment on Monday, November 23, of an increase in the British bank rate
from 5 to 7 per cent. Further reaction on Tuesday following the
announcement late Monday of the rise in the Federal Reserve discount
rate from 3-1/2 to 4 per cent was mild in the bond market but more
pronounced in the bill market. This pattern of reaction may have been
influenced by newspaper reports of Chairman Martin's press conference
in which the international reasons for the rise in rate and the Federal
Reserve's desire not to restrain the domestic economy were stressed.

Prior to the U.K. and U.S. bank rate actions, the Treasury
bond market had staged a rally lasting from about mid-October to almost
mid-November, when long-term bond yields touched their lows for the year.
The market showed signs of some hesitation around mid-November on the
appearance of profit taking by market professionals and in reaction to
the publication of net borrowed reserve figures. But these short-run

III -7
developments did not seem to effect any basic change in market
attitudes about the generally favorable long-run loutlook for bond
prices--which were conditioned by reports that many economic analysts
anticipated the pace of economic expansion would moderate in 1965 and
by the expectation of continued large savings flows into the capital
markets.
The market adjustment on Monday mainly reflected protective
dealer price markdowns of as much as a 1/2 point on some long-term
bonds, raising long-term yields 3 to 5 basis points. Prices declined
somewhat further after announcement of the Federal Reserve discount
rate increase. But bond yields on Tuesday were still several basis
points below their highs for the year.
Bill rates, as would be expected, adjusted more sharply than
yields on coupon issues. The bill market was already under seasonal
pressure prior to the central bank rate increases, as market demand
tapered off, dealer bill positions remained heavy, and dealer financing
became more costly (reflecting the general money market tightness
during the first three statement weeks in November).
Bills in the 3- and 6-month area rose around 10 basis points
on ionday, and there were also rate advances on other sensitive short-
term paper, such as bankers' acceptances and secondary market CD's.
In Monday's bill auction, the average issuing rate for 3-month bills
rose to 3.76 per cent, up 16 basis points from the previous week and
the highest since May 1960. On Tuesday, the new 3-month bill closed
at 3.80 per cent. Upward yield adjustments for bills were generally

III -8
more moderate on that day as dealer inventories were relieved by
System bill purchases amounting to $325 million.
The immediate yield adjustments in both the bill and bond
markets were substantially larger than those experienced in recent
years following increases in the U.K. bank rate. But the circumstances
were, of course, quite different. For example, the 5 to 7 per cent rise
in the British bank rate in September 1957 followed the August rise
from 3 to 3.5 per cent in the Federal Reserve discount rate, and the
market response to the British action was negligible. A similar rise
in the bank rate in July of 1961 occurred when the U.S. economy was
still in the early stage of economic recovery and short-term rates here
were well below the Federal Reserve discount rate (then 3 per cent).
The bank rate rise in late February of this year took place under
more comparable circumstances. But it was only a 1 percentage point
rise to 5 per cent; it elicited only a short-lived 5 basis point
increase in bill yields; and market expectations of generally rising
rates (also influenced by the tax cut at that time) tended to evaporate
as the Federal Reserve discount rate remained unchanged. In the
present circumstances, however, the fact that the British rate increase
was followed by a rise in the U.S. discount rate would tend to confirm
market expectations of higher rates in the United States, at least
in the short-term market.

III -9
Corporate and municipal bond markets. As in the government
securities market, the tone of markets for corporate; and State and
local government securities strengthened from late October through the
first two weeks in November, and yields on many issues slipped to new lows
for the year. The drop for seasoned municipal issues was particularly
sharp, with yields on Aaa-rated issues falling to 3.05 per cent, their
lowest level since May 1963.

Since the U.K. and U.S. bank rate action, yields on recently-
offered corporate bonds have moved up as much as 5 basis points.
While yields on municipal bonds rose Monday, most of this advance
was offset Tuesday, possibly reflecting market expectations of
increased commercial bank purchases of tax-exempts resulting from
the changes in Regulation Q.
Little upward pressure on bond yields can be expected from
borrowers' demands for funds in the near future. The unusually light
November volume of publicly-offered corporate bonds was an important
factor in recent market strength; and although offerings next month

III -13
are expected to increase substantially, they are estimeted at less
than one-half of last December's volume, and underwriters currently
have no unsold syndicate balances.
In the municipal market, the volume of new issues in December
should be roughly the same as the moderate November supply which met
good retail demand. Dealers' advertised inventories of recently offered
municipal issues, which fell more than $200 million during the past
month to less than $500 million in mid-November, have since risen to
nearly $600 million. It is difficult to gauge actual progress in
distributing older issues from data on advertised inventories, however,
since the sharp drop in yields over the past few weeks apparently had
encouraged dealers to hold offerings off the market in anticipation
of price increases.

Stock market. The British and Federal Reserve rate actions
had limited impact on the U.S. stock market. The Standard and Poor's
composite index closed at 85.73 on Tuesday, a drop of about one-half

III -11
of one per cent for the two days, In the preceding week, the index
had risen about 1 per cent to a new record high, after fluctuating
narrowly ghrough the first half of November. Last week's advance was
accompanied by a sharp increase in trading volume which averaged 5.6
million shares a day, up O.C million from the October average. Much
of the increased trading activity was reportedly in lower priced issues.
These developments apparently reflected a combination of factors
including favorable corporate profits and increasing dividends, and
renewed talk of inflation sparked in part by scattered announcements of
commodity price increases.
Stock market credit eased $41 million further during October.
Most of this decline took place in customers' debit balances, but
customers' credit extended by banks also dropped $5 million, the fiLst
month-to-month decline since January.
Home mortgage market. Home mortgage funds have generally
continued ample and mortgage terms have remained unusually favorable
for qualified borrowers this autumn. In October, the FHA-yield series
declined one basis point but at 5.45 per cent, was virtually unchanged
from its earlier low for the nineteenth consecutive month. Contract
interest rates on conventional first mortgages for new homes were also
little changed at 5.00 per cent for new home loans and 5.85 per cent
for loans on existing houses.
Average maturities and loan-to-price ratios for conventional
first mortgages on homes, continued below earlier peaks, but were
moderately higher in September than a year earlier, according to the

III -12
Federal Home Loan Bank Board. Loan amounts remained appreciably greater
than a year earlier, moreover, reflecting, in pabt, higher average
prices paid for homes and further upgrading by purchasers this year.

i'iortgage delinquencies generally have continued below the
advanced rates a year earlier, according to the regular survey conducted
by the Mortgage Bankers Association. This survey covers home mortgages
held or serviced by Association members and distinguishes mortgages
delinquent for 30 days or more from those "in foreclosure" as well as
those actually foreclosed. In the third quarter, delinquencies accounted
for 3.04 per hundred mortgages surveyed, compared with 3.17 per hundred
a year earlier and 2.08 in the third quarter of 1962. While the further
general rise in after-tax incomes of mortgagors was a factor in the
recent improvement, more rigorous collection policies by lenders were
probably also important. Partly reflecting this shift in collection
policies, mortgages in process of foreclosure, have showed a net rise

ILl -13
this year though they have remained relatively low. In the third cuarter,
"in foreclosure" rates averaged ,38 per hundred, as against .33 per
hundred a year earlier and .30 two years earlier.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
U.S. balance of payments, Tentative data for October and
the first half of November show an over-all payments deficit of over
$900 million. A net surplus in the remaining weeks of the year of
some $300-$400 million will be required if the fourth quarter deficit
is to remain close to the $2.3 billion annual rate of deficit recorded
in the third quarter.
The over-all balance in the fourth quarter as a whole is not
greatly affected by seasonal influences. Within the quarter, however,
thrge deficits have usually been recorded in October and November with
a surplus in December; in 1963, a surplus of nearly $400 million in
December followed an $800 million deficit in October-November. This
pattern is associated with a developing habit of movements of corporate
funds to Canada early in each quarter and reflows late in the same
quarter, large movements of funds into Canada as a result of window-
dressing operations of Canadian banks in October and November, and
the normal year-end repayments on U.S. Government loans and inflows
of private investment income. This year, movements of funds to Canada,
as indicated by changes in liabilities of Canadian agency banks to
their head offices, have been exceptionally large; these liabilities
rose by some $450 million through mid-November. If these outflows
of U.S. funds to Canada are reversed, a sizeable payments surplus in
December is quite possible.

-2-
The major known element that would raise the deficit is the
substantial increase in new foreign security issues in the fourth
quarter. These issues are now estimated to be higher than in the third
quarter by about $400 million, seasonally adjusted. Long-term bank
loans to foreigners increased by $110 million in October, continuing
the high rate of outflow of these loans that has occurred since midyear;
however, this higher rate of outflow has not been reflected in an in-
crease in commitments for these loans. Short-term claims on foreigners
reported by banks rose by $95 million in October; part of this rise
may have reflected the movements of funds to Canada mentioned above.
Business and financial developments abroad. The rise in
Britain's Bank rate from 5 to 7 per cent, which was quickly followed
by the rise in U.S. discount rates and an increase in the Canadian
discount rate from 4 to 4-1/4 per cent, afforded no relief to pressures
on the pount sterling in foreign exchange markets in the first two
days following the action. The effectiveness of the Bank rate increase
and of the British budgetary measures in bringing about the necessary
adjustments in the British economy are still to be determined; and until
signs appear that such adjustments are being effected, uncertainties
about the pound could be expected to keep conditions unsettled in
international financial markets. To meet heavy speculation on a
devaluation of the pound and to provide some time for the needed adjust-
ment in Britain's balance of payments, a $3 billion package of inter-
national financial assistance for sterling was arranged.

-3-
The impact of the measures so far taken by Britain on
economic conditions in the rest of Europe is inlikely to be large.
Although these actions occurred at a time when recovery from recession
in Italy was just beginning and when signs of some weakening were
appearing in the French economy, demands in other European countries
were continuing very strong and growth in output was being contained
by capacity limitations.
In Britain, the Bank rate was increased from 5 to 7 per cent
on November 23 in an effort to stem speculation against the pound
in foreign exchange markets. In the preceding ten days following the
Labor Government's Autumn Budget, sterling had come under heavy and
almost continuous pressure. The spot exchange rate dropped to
278.27 cents (November 20), close to the mandatory lower support
limit, and very substantial reserve losses led to large drawings on
short-term borrowing arrangements with European central banks and
with the U.S.
Following the rise in Bank rate speculation against sterling
was resumed on a large scale after one day's respite. To defend the
pound, the Group of Ten countries, Austria and the BIS announced on
November 25 their willingness to provide $3 billion in financial
assistance. This amount would supplement a $1 billion drawing from
the IMF already arranged.
The Autumn Budget, introduced on November 11 included,
only one measure in addition to the import surcharges that is
immediately effective and that will tend to dampen domestic demand
pressures. This was a 7 cent increase in taxes on gasoline and oil

used by road vehicles. The other measures announced are to take
effect at the beginning of next April and these included: (1) a
large rise in pensions and other welfare benefits about half of
which is to be offset by an increase in statutory pension contri-
butions; (2) a rise in income taxes affecting primarily those in
the higher income groups; (3) a revision of corporate income taxes
shifting a greater part of the burden from retained onto distributed
profits; and (4) a comprehensive capital gains tax. On the whole,
the new taxes will tend to fall more heavily on the higher income
groups while the rise in social welfare expenditures will tend to
provide net benefits to the lower income groups.
The budgetary measures would not seem to afford in them-
selves much relief to the pressures on the domestic economy and
hence not to assist correction of the large current account deficit
in the balance of payments.
The rise in government revenues from the new taxes is
expected only to match the increase in government expenditures.
Moreo the shift in demand from imports onto domestic production
induced by the import surcharges and the fact that the measures
tend to favor consumption at the expense of saving may well heighten
internal pressures. A major aim of these measures appears to be to
obtain a moderation of union pressures for higher wage rates.
Prior to the above measures, the latest British statistics

confirmed the picture of growing or at least continuing pressures
of demand:(1) the October trade deficit totaled $260 million, lower
than in September but about equal to the average monthly deficit
since last spring; (2) prices continued to inch up in October, abetted
by rising world commodity prices; (3) the most recent Federation of
British Industries survey showed skilled labor shortages to be an
increasingly important factor in limiting output and showed a further
increase in the proportion of respondents reporting full plant
utilization. On the other hand, the preliminary index of industrial
production for October declined one point after showing no change
for nine months.
An apparent rise in industrial production in Italy in
September, coupled with reports of improved business sentiment and
a pickup in imports in September, suggests that the Italian recession
may have "bottomed out" in August.
The Italian authorities are now actively promoting a
revival of economic activity and have taken three major steps in
this direction. First, beginning in August the Bank of Italy has
increased its lines of credit to the commercial banks, although
through September the banks did not use any of this additional availa-
ble credit. Second, the Bank of Italy will finance purchases by the
savings banks of a substantial volume of bonds to be issued by a
number of State-owned enterprises. Third, the government has re-
pealed the special purchase taxes on automobiles imposed last
February.

There was another large balance of payments surplus in
October, provisionally placed at $165 million, bringing the cumulative
surplus for the year to $U58 million.
Upward price movements have continued in France, despite
the use of price controls and other measures over the past year.
In September, indexes of wholesale and consumer prices were 1.3
and 2.5 per cent higher, respectively, than a year earlier. Con-
sumer prices in September alone rose by 0.5 per cent and because
the October index is expected also to show a large rise, the
government has introduced the following additional controls: (1) it
has frozen the prices of restaurant meals at late October levels;
(2) it has placed price controls on pork and will take measures to
ease upward pressures on beef, bread, fish, and butter; and (3) it
will postpone for 6 months the increase in controlled rents
scheduled for January.
Other developments suggest that recent price increases
relate more to earlier than to current demand pressures. The index
of industrial production in September was, as expected, little
changed from last springts level* A September survey of the French
business situation found little change since July in order backlogs
or in industrialistst outlook for production in the following 3 or
4 months. Industrialists continued to be about evenly divided as to
whether output would rise or fall, and these results are being
interpreted as further evidence that any increase in production over
the remainder of 1964 will be very small*

Early in October, the liquid asset reserve requirement
of the commercial banks was reduced from 36 to 34 per cent of
deposits. This redudtion was desigied to avoid an expected tighten-
ing of money market conditiols &Ad to permit the bank credit to
expand in line with the 10 per cent a year ceiling previously Set.
The pace of economic expansion in Germany has in recent
months become more moderate. This somewhat slower growth is
attributed in part to the slowing down of foreign demand, but to a
greater degree to output limitations. Current utilization of
capacity, according to a recent survey, is at about the peak rate
reached in the last cycle in spring of 1962. Also, the continuing
labor tightness is becoming an increasingly limiting factor to out-
put expansion with 6.7 vacancies for each person unemployed in
September as compared with 6.0 a year earlier.
With supply availabilities becoming increasingly limited,
pressures on costs and prices are becoming more pronounced. Thus in
August and September, domestic prices for industrial goods rose by
0.3 per cent and 0.5 per cent, respectively, much faster than in
preceding months.
The passage of the DM 3.2 billion tax cut early this
month to take effect in Janaury and higher wage rates likely to
result from wage negotiations within the next few months are
expected to raise disposable incomes significantly early next year.
In addition, investment plans continue to show a rising trend.

Canada's expansion continues to be aided by strong
external demand for Canadian exports. Seasonally adjusted exports
throughout the third quarter were running 2 per cent above the level
of the spring. Unemployment rose in mid-October but this apparently
reflected the impact of U.S. auto strikes. Wholesale prices
continued to fall through September while consumer prices, which
rose 1 per cent earlier in the year, leveled off in September and
October.
Japanese industrial production rose 2.5 per cent in
September, following a pause in the upswing in June-August. Raw
materials inventories rose 2 per cent in September, but were still
slightly below the peak reached last January. New orders for
machinery picked up in August after remaining relatively stable
from May through July.
Seasonally adjusted imports rose by 8 per cent in October
for the second month in succession; exports also rose sharply.
Taking September and October together, the trade deficit averaged
$77 million as compared to a monthly average of $50 million in
July-August.

APPENDIX A: FEDERAL BUDGET IN FISCAL 1965*
The likely budgetary position of the Federal Government in fiscal
1965 has become somewhat clearer with the publication of the Midyear Budget
Review and with more recent additional information on the current rate at
which individual taxes are being withheldd The Midyear Budget Review, as
noted in the previous green book, showed a cash deficit of $3.5 billion
for fiscal 1965 and a deficit of $3.2 billion on a national income accounts
basis, both smaller deficits than in fiscal 1964.
Meanwhile, the recent evidence on tax withholdings has led the
Department of Commerce to increase personal tax payments in the second
quarter of calendar 1964 by $1.2 billion (at an annual rate). This upward
revision reflects the voluntary adjustment in withheld tax payments appar-
ently made by individuals to compensate partially for the under-withholding
implicit in the new 14 per cent withholding rate effective in March of
this year.
This development was not apparent earlier in the year because of
the manner in which withheld taxes are paid into the Treasury. Employers
pay such taxes together with withheld Old Age and Survivors Insurance taxes
in one check. The Treasury then uses formulas to distribute these receipts
for administrative purposes between individual income and OASDI taxes.
During the second quarter and after, the amount of revenue coming into the
combined account was higher than anticipated; on the basis of the allocation
formula for that period, the increased revenue was credited to the OASDI
account. But second quarter data furnished to the Department of Commerce
by the Social Security Administration (taken from the forms accompanying
the tax payments) suggested that the increased revenue did not represent
social security payments. Therefore, it would appear that the additional
revenue represented higher withheld income taxes.
This increased revenue indicates that at least some taxpayers
voluntarily adjusted their withholding rate, either by dropping exemptions
or by specifying a higher rate of payment. Our current estimate would be
that the average withholding rate which applies after exemptions has been
in the neighborhood of 14.5 per cent rather than the 14 per cent specified
in the new tax law. This still represents substantial underwithholding,
however, given the new tax structure and given the timing of the drop in
withholding rates.
The apparent voluntary upward adjustment of the withholding rate
changes the quarterly pattern of Federal receipts somewhat from what was
previously expected. We nou anticipate that about $500 million is coming
in during July-December 1964 which was originally expected to be paid in
the spring of 1965 as final settlement of the 1964 individual income tax

liability. This increased withholding reduces the autumn deficit by $500
millionland also reduces the expected spring surplus by about the same
amount.- The autumn-t6-spking swing in the cash budget from deficit to
surplus is thetefore cut by about $1 billion as compared with earlier
anticipations.
This woild now mean a swing from a cash deficit of nearly
$10.5 billion in July-December 1964 td a tash surplus df about $7 billioh
in January-June 1965. A substantial part of such a swihg 16 df coursei
seasonal. But even after allowance for seasonal movements the cash budget
is still expected to show an approximately $4 billion swing from a July-
December deficit of $3.7 billion to a small surplus of $200 million in
January-June 1965, as the accompanying table shows. This contrasts with
a swing of only $1.3 billion in the comparable period of fiscal 1964.
The quarterly pattern expected for fiscal 1965 shows gradually diminish-
ing deficits as the year progresses, and a turn to a seasonally adjusted
surplus in the April-June quarter of 1965, when unpaid individual and
corporate tax liabilities for 1964 become due.
Roughly the same quarterly pattern is shown by the projections
of Federal receipts and expenditures in the national income accounts--
the deficits become smaller as the year progresses, falling from a
seasonally adjusted quarterly deficit of $1.3 billion in the third quar-
ter of 1964 to a deficit of only $300 million in the second quarter of
1965. But, the movement toward a less: expansionary budget is not as sharp
as in the cash budget. The national ipcome budget shows a decrease in the
deficit from July-December to January-June of only $1.5 billion, mainly
because more smoothing is introduced ito this budget by recording corpor-
ate tax receipts on an accrual basis. -The movement to a smaller deficit,
during the course of fiscal 1965 contrasts with the movement toward a
larger deficit in the comparable period of fiscal 1964 in the national
income accounts budget.
These quarterly patterns are within the constraint of fiscal
year totals presented in the Midyear Budget Review. If expenditures should
turn out to be somewhat higher than anticipated in the Review, this would
be reflected mainly in a reduction in the size of the spring surplus; such
a possibility would raise the fiscal 1965 deficit, perhaps by $500 million
or so, and would reduce the swing between the two halves of the year com-
mensurately. The expected January-July cash surplus would also be reduced
1/ Technically, there would be a larger reduction of the spring surplus--
perhaps $300 million larger--because of tax payments that we now believe
were already made in the last four months of fiscal 1964. This would
have the effect of increasing the fiscal 1965 cash deficit from $3.5
to $3.8 billion. But the analysis here has been kept generally within
the constraint of the midyear review fiscal year totals.

if the apparent voluntary increase in the withholding rate is reversed
when the second stage of the current tax reduction program becomes effec-
tive next January; if this occurs, revenues in the spring would be lower
than current projections. Spring revenues could also be lower if an excise
tax reduction were passed quickly. However, it appears that a July 1
effective date is the earliest likely for any excise tax reduction. As to
the amount of such a reduction, no official proposal has been made yet,
but it would seem that excise tax cuts larger than $2 -$2.5 billion per
year are unlikely.
On the other hand, there is the possibility that receipts could
be buttressed in January-June 1965 by larger than expected capital gains
tax payments, although new provisions in the tax law add to the uncertainty
of predicting such receipts. Moreover, it is likely that there will be an
increase, in some form, of social security taxes and benefits in connection
with medicare early in the new session of Congress. It would require rapid
passage, however, to have much effect on receipts and expenditures in the
last half of fiscal 1965.
Setting aside the above mentioned possibilities, the projected
reduction in Federal budgetary deficits in the course of fiscal 1965
reflects in part the effect on tax receipts of the expected continued
grbwth in the economy. But it also reflects a less expansive fiscal policy
on the part of the Government in the first half of calendar year 1965.
This is seen not only from the timing of tax payments implicit in the new
tax lau but also in the continued restraint on expenditures especially as
recorded in the cash budget. Federal expenditures in the national income
accounts are projected to continue to rise moderately for the rest of the
fiscal year, but not by enough to offset the swing in tax receipts.
