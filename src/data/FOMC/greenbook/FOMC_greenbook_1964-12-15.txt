IN BROAD REVIEW
Changes in the economic and financial situation have continued
orderly and not greatly different from those taking place before the
international financial crisis and the steps taken to deal with it. In
sensitive commodity markets, prices have changed little; in credit and
capital markets, initial responses were relatively moderate and have
been generally followed by a return toward earlier yield levels. Short-
term market rates have held significantly above their levels before the
increase in the discount rate, although Treasury bill rates have declined
a little from the peaks reached at the time of the December 1 meeting.
Stock market prices have receded but the volume of trading has been moder-
ate and the net decline in prices from the record level of November 20
is less than 3 per cent.
Business confidence remains high, according to recently reported
surveys of business plans for plant and equipment outlays, of actual
capital appropriations by manufacturers, and of manufacturers' antici-
pated inventories and sales. The official plant and equipment survey
indicates a further rise in fixed capital outlays through mid-1965, but
at a lower rate than this year.
The Board's production index still appears likely to rise to
a new high in November and probably will advance again in December, unless
transportation strikes disrupt activity on a wide scale. The labor market,
aside from the increased unrest now coming to the surface in many places,
shows some strengthening of demand. The over-all unemployment rate
declined in November but remained within the range prevailing since May.

I -2
Commodity prices recently have been slightly above the level of
the past year. Since mid-October the industrial component apparently has
risen a little further while farm and food prices have declined. Consumer
prices have continued about 1-1/4 per cent above a year earlier.
GNP in the fourth quarter will probably show a much smaller
increase than earlier this year when each quarter showed a gain of $10
billion. The shortfall largely reflects a slower rate of expansion in
consumer spending because of sharply curtailed auto supplies. In the
first quarter of next year, however, the increase in GNP may be unusually
large--and considerably larger than can be sustained--as strike curtail-
ments are made up and as protective ordering against future strikes
continues.
In the financial area, bank credit expansion was large in
November, reflecting in the main the heavy volume of Treasury financing.
Long-term credit demands on the capital markets have been moderate while
supplies of funds have remained quite adequate.
Growth in time deposits was unusually large in November, but
the increase in the money supply was a little less than the average of
the previous three months. Free reserves averaged only $10 million over
the five weeks ending December 2, compared with $90 million in October.
The balance of payments deficit in the fourth quarter will tend
to be reduced by inflows of U.S. private capital as a result of the
sterling crisis, although no magnitude can be given to the amounts involved.
Such funds are volatile and these inflows are likely to be reversed if the
outlook for the British balance of payments and sterling improves. Sterling
has remained weak in foreign exchange markets, however, necessitating
official support of both the spot and the forward rates.

1-3
Short-term interest rates in Britain and Canada have moved up
by about as much as the increases in discount rates, but movements in
bond yields in these markets have been small. Aside from the Euro-dollar
market, reactions in other financial markets abroad have been negligible.
Movements in forward exchange rates have offset changes in relative
interest rates, and covered interest rate differentials have shown
little change.

THE DOMESTIC ECONOMY
Industrial production. Industrial production in November
still appears to have increased about 2-1/2 points from the reduced
October level of 131,7 per cent to somewhat above the September figure
of 134.0. A firmer figure for November will be available for the
Supplement.
The direct effects of the auto strike on the index can be
seen in the table below. From August to October, output of autos,
trucks, and motor vehicle parts dropped 65 points and the total
production index declined 2 points to 132 per cent of the 1957-59
average. Output of final products and materials other than automotive
increased further.

Total 134 134 132
Automotive 161 150 96
Exclusive of automotive
Final products 131 131 133
Materials 132 134 134
Passenger car assemblies in November slightly exceeded earlier
schedules and the seasonally adjusted index rose to 145 per cent of the
1957-59 average from an October low of 83 per cent--an increase amounting
to more than one point in the total industrial production index.
Additional gains in trucks and motor vehicle parts will bring the

II -2
increase fot the automotiVe industry to over 2 points in the total
index.
With all firms back in full production at the start of
December, domestic automobile producers have scheduled a record butput
of 866,000 units for the month. If these schedules are met, the auto
assembly index will rise to 170 per cent of the 1957-59 average--a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 8.8 million cars. Such an advance
by itself would contribute half a point to the over-all production
index. Part of this flood of new cars is to boost inventories, which
at the end of November were 10 per cent below a year earlier.
Output of iron and steel changed little from July to
October, at a level of around 130 per cent of the 1957-59 average.
During most of this period output was about 30 per cent above the
level a year earlier when inventories were being liquidated. In
November, steel ingot output increased and available weekly data on
coal, crude oil, petroleum refinery runs, and miscellaneous freight car-
loadings, indicate a continued high level of output in those industries.
Paper and paperboard production declined due to a 12-day strike on the
West Coast.
Consumer spending. On the basis of current information, it
appears that the increase in consumer purchases of goods and services
in the fourth quarter will be one of the smallest quarterly increases
of this expansion period. Consumer after-tax income will show a sizable
gain, however, and the personal saving rate is likely to rise
significantly.

II -3
The smallness of the increase in consumer spending is mainly
attributable to the limited availability of new autos. Even if auto
sales in December are as large as indicated, fourth quarter sales will
show a considerable reduction from the preceding quarter.
In November, total retail sales apparently declined moderately
further from their already reduced October level. The November decline
is attributable to sales of nondurable goods, with unusually warm
weather an adverse influence on apparel sales. The October-November
average for nondurable goods stores is estimated to be up less than
one per cent from the third quarter average. The two-month average
for furniture and appliance stores is little changed from the third
quarter level, while the automotive group is, of course, down sharply.
As compared with a year earlier, October-November sales were up 7
per cent for both nondurable goods and furniture and appliances.
If the strength shown in auto markets toward the end of
November continues, December sales of domestic cars will total at
least 650,000 units, or 4 per cent more than a year ago. The
indicated annual rate for the fourth quarter is 7.0 million and for
the year nearly 7.6 million.
Sharing the expansion, sales of imported automobiles have
increased considerably this year and will come close to half a million.
Thus total new car sales are likely to reach a historic high of 8.0
million units or more.

Consumer credit. Instalment debt rose $410 million in
October, considerably less than in September ($513 million) and one of
the smallest increases this year. The reduction in auto sales was
largely responsible for the slowdown. However, the proportion of cars
sold on credit increased somewhat, reversing the September-October
pattern of recent years. The earlier introduction of new models this
year contributed to this shift, since cash buyers tend to be more
numerous early in the model year than later on.
Extensions of auto credit in October fell to their lowest
level since last January. Repayments on auto contracts also turned
down, but not as sharply. The net result was a seasonally adjusted
increase of only $136 million in auto debt, well under the average of
$217 million for the first nine months and the $234 million increase
of October 1963.
Excluding the auto category, the rise in instalment debt in
October was almost equal to the September advance and considerably larger
than in other recent months.

II -5
Demands for personal loans continued strong although, with
repayments accelerating sharply, the net increase in such debt was less
than in September. Obligations incurred for the purchase of GAF-type
goods, on the other hand, accumulated more rapidly in October than in
any month since last March.
New construction. Seasonally adjusted new construction
activity changed little from October to November when it was at a rate
just below the high in July. Private residential activity, which had
already declined 9 per cent from its peak in March, was about unchanged
in November. Private nonresidential construction continued at a record
high.
The value of total activity in the first eleven months of
this year averaged 6 per cent above a year earlier, and followed full
year gains of 5 per cent in 1963 and 7 per cent in 1962. The Commerce
Department recently forecast a more moderate rise for 1965, 3 per cent,
with a further decline assumed for apartment building.

The survey also found that actual outlays in the third quarter
were substantially larger than those anticipated last August, thereby
continuing the pattern of upward revision that has prevailed since
the beginning of the year. Expenditures for this year are now
estimated at $44.7 billion, $5.5 billion or 13.9 per cent higher than
in 1963. This compares with a 10 per cent gain for the year indicated
by the February survey.
Implications of the latest survey for spending for the full
year 1965 are uncertain. Fixed capital spending now planned for the
first two quarters of next year averages 8 per cent above the average
for the full year 1964. If outlays in the second half of next year
were to increase by the $1 billion a quarter now indicated for the

II -7
first half, expenditures for the year as a whole would be 10 per cent
above 1964. This bit of arithmetic may be compared with the McGraw-Hill
survey taken in October which indicated a rise of 5 per cent for the
year, or 8 per cent after allowance for probable understatement as
indicated by previous surveys.
Manufacturers' outlays for plant and equipment this year are
now expected to total $18.5 billion, up 18.0 per cent from last year,
and by nonmanufacturing industries, $26.2 billion, up 11 per cent.
Most manufacturing industries now plan to increase spending further
in the first half of next year with motor vehicles, nonelectrical
machinery, stone-clay-glass, and other durable goods industries
anticipating substantial advances. Among nonmanufacturing industries,
public utilities and commercial firms, mainly trade, account for most
of the increase.
Manufacturers reported that expenditures yet to be made on
projects already under way rose further from the end of June to the
end of September, when they were nearly one-third larger than a year
earlier.
Continued strength in manufacturers' outlays for fixed
capital is also indicated by the just released results of the Newsweek-
NICB survey of capital appropriations of manufacturers. Appropriations
in the third quarter rose to $5.4 billion, seasonally adjusted, $500
million more than in the second quarter. Appropriations were
substantially larger than expenditures and the backlog of unspent
appropriations rose further.

II -8
Business inventories. The book value of business inventories
declined moderately in October, as a drop of $770 million at distributors
more than offset a rise of $565 million at manufacturers. Virtually
the entire decline at distributors was in dealers' stocks of autos.
Apart from auto dealers, distributors' stocks were about unchanged for
the month.
Despite the decline in October, an increase in inventory
investment probably occurred in the fourth quarter. Auto stocks
recently have been rising more than seasonally. As noted, inventory
accumulation was stepped up sharply at manufacturers in October and
manufacturers anticipate a continued high rate of accumulation for
the quarter as a whole.
According to the latest Commerce quarterly survey conducted
in November, manufacturers anticipate an inventory build-up totaling
$1.2 billion in the fourth quarter. A book value increase of this size
would be double the third quarter rise, which in turn was sharply above
the low rates in the first half of the year. In looking ahead to the
first quarter next year, manufacturers anticipate a drop back to an
increase of $600 million. Accompanying these inventory anticipations,
manufacturers expect no change in sales from the third to the fourth
quarter of this year but a rise of nearly 3 per cent in the first
quarter of 1965.
Of the $1.2 billion inventory increase expected in the
current quarter, $700 million would be in durable goods industries
and $500 million in the nondurable sector. The latter increase

II -9
represents a pronounced step-up, but at the end of the third quarter,
the level of nondurable goods inventories was about the same as at the
end of 1963. In the first quarter of next year, nondurable goods
producers expect to revert to a very small inventory gain and durable
goods producers anticipate an increase of about $500 million, about
the same as occurred in the third quarter of this year.
Labor market. Employment strengthened in November largely
because favorable weather conditions permitted more workers than usual
to engage in construction and other outdoor work. Total employment
(household survey) increased by nearly 400,000 with most of the gain
among adult men. The increase from November 1963 amounted to 1.5
million, about the same as in other months this year.
Unemployment declined slightly to 5.0 per cent in November
from 5.2 per cent in October, a rate within the 4.9-5.3 per cent range
which has prevailed since May. The November decline in unemployment
was mainly among adult men and those with short-term joblessness.
The unemployment rate for adult men declined to 3.5 per cent and for
married men to 2.5 per cent. For these groups the rates are now close
to those in 1956 and 1957 when over-all unemployment was 4 per cent.
There was no improvement among youths or in the total number of long-term
job seekers.
Unemployment among teenagers continued at 15 per cent, about
one-half greater than seven years ago. The imbalance between supply
and demand for important groups may widen further as sharply increased
numbers of high school graduates enter the labor market in 1965.

II -10
The civilian labor force rose by 200,000 in November and,
at 74.4 million, was only 900,000 above a year ago. This contrasts
with an average increase of 1.3 million so far this year. Most of the
increase in the labor force so far this year has occurred among
teenagers and adult women, For these groups, employment gains have
about offset their labor force growth. Among adult men, there has been
little labor force growth and continued strength in demand has resulted
in a decline in unemployment.
Industrial relations. Major transportation strikes are
threatened within the next two weeks. Mediation between the railroads
and three shopcraft unions has reached a stalemate. The unions have
set December 15 as the strike deadline but the companies are expected
to seek an injunction to halt the strike. Although all other
nonoperating unions have agreed to a three-year contract providing
for a 9 cents an hour wage increase and additional fringes as
recommended by an emergency board, the three skilled unions are asking
for a larger wage increase so as to maintain wage differentials for
skilled workers in the railroad shops.
A strike of the East and Gulf Coast longshoremen was averted
September 30 by the President's invoking of the Taft-Hartley Act,
thereby exhausting established emergency procedures. The strike can
be resumed December 21 and would affect all East Coast and Gulf shipping.
The dispute centers on automation, size of work crews and job security
guarantees. Wages are not an issue. Some progress has been made in
settling the dispute but differences still exist.

The steel union's wage policy committee met during the past
week and called for a formal reopening of the contract on January 1,
which in effect establishes a strike deadline on May 1. New contract
demands promulgated by the Committee were extremely broad including
substantial wage increases, earlier retirement, reinstatement of the
cost of living escalator clause and other fringe improvements. In
addition, demands were made for changes in local contracts relating to
size of crews, contracting out, seniority, overtime, etc.
Prices. Daily indexes of commodity prices have changed little
over the past two weeks, in the wake of the British and U.S. monetary
actions, The BLS daily index of 13 raw industrials has declined
slightly further to a point 1 per cent below the high reached at the
end of October; the decline reflects a sharp drop in tin prices after
announcement by GSA of a large increase in the amount of the metal it
will make available from the stockpile. In the London metal market
tin prices also have declined appreciably; spot and futures prices for
other nonferrous metals have continued to show fairly large day-to-day
fluctuations but early this week they were little changed from levels
just prior to the increase in the bank rate.
Weekly estimates of the wholesale price index through
November indicate continued stability in the total. However, stability
since mid-October has reflected further declines in farm products
and foods and a slight further rise in industrial commodities. At an
estimated 101.3 per cent of the 1957-59 average, the industrial index

II -12
at the end of November was up about 1/2 per cent from the level which
prevailed in the first 9 months of the year. The rise since September
has reflected mainly some recovery in fuel oils and further increases
in nonferrous metals and scrap. In late November, major producers of
aluminum raised prices of ingot one-half cent to 24-1/2 cents per
pound and prices of most semi-fabricated products 2 to 3 per cent.
The consumer price index increased by .1 per cent in October
to 108.5 per cent of its 1957-59 average and remained 1.2 per cent
above a year earlier. Prices of new cars, apparel, and fuels showed
increases that were related to seasonal developments, and nonfood
commodities averaged only .4 per cent higher than in October 1963.
Services continued to rise at an annual rate of about 2 per cent. Food
prices declined slightly in October due primarily to decreases in meats,
eggs, and fruits and vegetables. Since October 1963, however, food
prices have risen about 2 per cent, mainly because of a 5 per cent
rise in fruits and vegetables as a result of unfavorable weather in
some areas.
Agricultural outlook for 1965. Department of Agriculture
analysts at the Outlook Conference on November 16-19 predicted little
change for the agricultural sector in 1965. For the economy as a
whole they forecast that the current expansion, aided by the tax cut,
would continue in 1965 but at a somewhat lesser rate than in 1964.
They noted that the business expansion thus far has been associated
with little over-all change in wholesale prices,

II -13
Rising incomes have stimulated spending for food, now running
5 per cent above a year earlier. Further gains are forecast for 1965
with the physical volume matching the increase in population and with
retail prices increasing only slightly. On a per capita basis, the
volume of food consumed is up 1 per cent in 1964 with most of the
increase in beef and fresh fruits. Further small gains in consumption
of these products in 1965 will probably offset declines in pork, lamb,
and dairy products.
Mill consumption of cotton is expected to rise sharply in
1965, largely in response to the rebate provided by recent legislation.
Farm exports for the year beginning last July probably will
not equal the record $6.1 billion of 1963-64, largely because of more
nearly normal wheat shipments. Cotton and tobacco experts may be
down moderately because of stronger competition from foreign suppliers.
Larger shipments of feed grains, soybeans, vegetable oils, dry nonfat
mild, and hides are expected to partly offset these declines.
Little change is expected in realized net incomes of farm
operators in 1965 from the $12.5 billion level prevailing since 1960,
but realized returns per farm will probably be higher, assuming
continuation of the trend towards fewer and larger farms. Gross
realized income may be much the same as in 1964 with slightly lower
cash receipts offset by higher direct payments. The smaller than usual
increase in production expenses in 1964 may extend into 1965 reflecting
continued stability in prices paid for items used in production and
declining amounts of labor used.

II -14
Production of both livestock and crops is likely to increase
somewhat in 1965. Livestock output will prbbably rise less than the
3 per cent increase of 1964, when beef production rose 10 per cent. With
normal weather, crop production which was reduced by drought in 1964 should
regain this loss. Little change in average farm prices of livestock and
products is foreseen for 1965. Meat animal prices may be strengthened
by the lower hog production indicated by the pig crop estimates and by
further government purchases of beef which proved effective in 1964.
Not much change is in prospect for crop prices either. Substantially
lower 1964 loan rates on cotton and wheat will continue in 1965. How-
ever, feed grain loan rates are up a little. Prices of potatoes and
some other vegetables will be lower, if average growing conditions prevail.
Farm real estate values are expected to continue upward during
1965. Demand for land continued to outpace offerings during 1964. Half
of the sales were for farm enlargement.
Debts of farmers will probably continue to rise in 1965 too,
but not as much as the value of farmers' assets, and some further in-
crease in farmers' equities is expected. Aggregate debt of farmers at
the end of 1964 is estimated at $36 billion, up 10 per cent from a year
earlier. Some refinancing of short-term debt into longer-term loans
secured by real estate has been reported in cattle feeding and producing
areas and in some other areas. Repayment rates remain high and the
supply of loanable funds large. Competition among lenders for sound
loans was keen throughout 1964.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL SITUATION
U.S. Government finance. In early December yields in all
maturity sectors of the U.S. Government securities market receded from
their recent highs reached after the Bank of England and Federal Reserve
rate actions.
On December 8, Treasury bond yields were only a few basis
points above their 1964 lows reached around mid-November. The initial
adjustment in the Treasury bond market to the official rate actions

was relatively mild and only modest selling of coupon issues mainly by
commercial banks, appeared. Retail selling pressure in the market
tapered off following System purchases of notes and bonds totaling
about $105 million in the first two days of December, and an improved
market atmosphere developed with the return of some investment and
professional demand. The market was also buoyed by President Johnson's
speech to the Business Advisory Council urging banks not to raise their

III -2
interest rates to borrowers and by the subsequent rescinding by a
large Boston bank of its previously announced increase in the prime
rate.
Dealer positions in securities maturing in more than a year,
at just under $600 million, showed virtually no change on balance
over the week ending December 7, despite the System's purchases.
Thus, dealers absorbed about $100 million in securities from banks
and other investors, mainly in the 5-10 year maturity area. Reportedly,
many of these investors were shortening up and switching into bills.
The demand for Treasury bills in the market picked up in late
November and early December and was augmented by System purchases
totaling $1.3 billion between November 24 and December 4 to supply
seasonal reserve needs. In this period dealers were willing sellers
of bills and worked down bill positions to their lowest levels in
almost 3 years. As the trading supply of bills was reduced, bill
rates backed away from their peaks. But following unexpectedly large
awards of $1.1 billion of new bills to dealers in the December 7
weekly auction, bill rates adjusted higher. The 3-month bill closed
at 3.84 per cent on December 8, as compared with the recent peak of
3.88 per cent on December 1.
The rise in other short-term rates since November 20 is
shown in the following table:

Treasury financing outlook. The Treasury is currently
expected to end the calendar year with a cash balance of perhaps
$7.3 billion, which would be $700 million more than the balance at
the end of 1963. Still, seasonal drains during January and early
February will require the Treasury to raise new cash early next year.
The market anticipates that a portion of this cash will be raised
through an addition of perhaps $1.5 billion to the June tax bill.
The Treasury could also add $100 million to weekly auctions of bills
during January and February.
The next regularly scheduled financing in the coupon area
will be the refinancing of about $4.0 billion bonds ($3.4 billion
publicly-held) maturing February 15. In recent years, the Treasury
has also undertaken advance refundings early in the year when market
conditions were favorable.

Corporate and municipal bond markets. Reaction in the capital
markets to the sterling crisis and subsequent increase in Federal Reserve
discount rates had apparently run its course by last week, when three
new corporate bond issues--the first large public offerings since late
October--came to market. Reoffering yields on these issues--adjusted to
a Aaa basis--averaged 4.47 per cent, only 1 basis point above the adjusted
yield on the last comparable new corporate bond which had been offered in
the third week of October.
Initially, yields on corporate and municipal bonds had risen as
much as 7 basis points in the wake of the U.K. and U.S. discount rate
actions. But last week when it became apparent that no general increase
in the prime rate at city banks was likely to follow these actions, the
three new corporate offerings sold out quickly, encouraging further yield
declines in the secondary market. Currently, yields on recently offered
corporate issues have erased more than half of their late November rise.
They are also slightly below the levels prevailing in mid-October at the
start of the earlier bond market rally, but, as is often the case, the more
sluggish yield series on seasoned corporate bonds have not fully re-
flected either the general rise or subsequent decline of other bond yields.
In the market for State and local bonds, yields have also retraced much of
their recent advance, carrying the average on Moody's high grade issues back
down to the yearly low reached in mid-November.

The recent readjustment of corporate bond yields toward the
levels reached before the British discount rate action has reflected in
large measure the continuing ample supply of long-term funds relative
to the limited volume of recent and prospective new offerings. Market
reports indicate that pension funds in particular were active buyers
of last week's new issues--once the immediate uncertainties on the prime
rate dissipated.
In contrast to the corporate calendar, December offerings of
municipal issues are expected to be unseasonably large, with the
prospective volume more than $250 million above a year earlier. Recent
market strength in the face of this year-end test may reflect an
expectation that the changes in Regulation Q will operate to sustain,
and possibly to increase, commercial bank participation in municipal
issues. In any event, demand for new issues has remained favorable,
and dealers' advertised inventories have declined further.__

Stock prices. Stock prices as measured by Standard and Poor's
composite index of 500 common stocks reacted to the uncertainties of
late November with 6 consecutive daily declines from the record level
of 86.28 which had been reached on November 20. The declines however
were orderly and trading volume shrank from 5.6 million shares on
November 20 to an average of 4.7 million shares per day over the past
two weeks. More recently, the index has fluctuated uncertainly;
after erasing about a third of the earlier declines last week, it
has since edged down again and on December 8 closed at 84.00.
Mortgage markets. 1iortgage funds have remained ample and
trade expectations are that the Federal Reserve discount and Regulation
Q actions by themselves will have little immediate effect on either
mortgage rates or lending activity. Total mortgage debt in the third
quarter expanded at a rate slightly below that a year earlier. This
reflected the recent slowing in residential construction activity as
well as indications of increased selectivity by some lenders--notably
savings and loan associations--in making some types of loans. Nevertheless,

III -7
in October, prices of houses and loan amounts on conventional first
mortgages continued to average appreciably higher than a year earlier,
according to the Federal Home Loan Bank Board. Except for a decline
in average fees and charges, most other terms were also at or near
their year-earlier levels.

Bank credit. Total credit at all commercial banks, seasonally
adjusted, rose $4.1 billion in November following a sizable reduction in
October. Expansion was rapid at both weekly reporting and outside banks,
with the rise at outside banks being particularly large in the last
half of the month. Major factors in the rise were (1) a large increase
in holdings of U.S. Government securities associated with the large volume
and unusual timing of Treasury financing and (2) a controversial rise
in loans to nonbank dealers to finance increased trading positione and

refinance maturing repurchase agreements with nonfinancial corporations.
Over the past five months, credit growth has been at an annual rate
of 8.1 per cent, the same as over the first half of this year and
the full year 1963.

The $1.4 billion increase in holdings of U.S. Government securities
reflected not only the larger than usual volume of Treasury financing
in November but also the delivery of the June tax bills only one day
prior to the end-of-month bank condition statement date. Banks were
allotted about $1.5 billion of the new 18-month Treasury notes, issued
November 15, whereas they held only about $1 billion of the maturing
issues; they were allotted practically all of the $1.5 billion June
tax bills, issued November 24, for which 50 per cent of the payment was

III -9
permitted through credit to tax and loan accounts. At weekly reporting
banks, these bill acquisitions slightly more than offset heavy sales
earlier in the month, but sales were large again in the week ending
December 2. Banks continued to reduce their holdings of long-term
U.S. Government bonds,
Banks added to their holdings of municipal and agency issues
in November at about the same rapid pace as in August and September. Since
midyear, the growth rate has been almost twice that for the first half of 1964
but substantially below that for the year 1963.
Total loans increased substantially in November, reflecting
not only the heavy borrowing by Government security dealers in
connection with the Treasury financings but also relatively strong
growth in most other major loan categories. Excluding security loans,
the November increase was somewhat larger than in most other recent
months, but the annual rate of growth since midyear is somewhat below
that for the first half of this year and for the full year 1963.
Business loans at all commercial banks, seasonally adjusted,
increased $500 million in November following a $200 million rise in
October. Expansion at city banks was quite rapid over the first three
weeks of the month, but this was followed by an appreciable decline
in the last reporting week. There was a large rise again in the first
week of December. Over the past five months, the growth rate has been
a little slower than earlier in the year and a little faster than
over the full year 1963.

III -10
The substantial November rise was attributable mainly to heavy
borrowing by food processors and commodity dealers and to a large rise
in total business loans at the smaller banks in the weekly series which
do not report an industrial breakdown. Over the past couple of months,
borrowing by food processors and commodity dealers has been running
close to the accelerated pace that developed in late 1963, when these
borrowers curtailed use of acceptances for meeting part of their
seasonal financing needs. On the other hand, expansion in loans to
petroleum and chemicals companies, which had been rapid in September
and October, slackened in November, and outstanding loans to the metals
group showed only about the usual seasonal rise.
Money supply and time deposits. The seasonally adjusted money
supply increased $500 million in November, a little below the average
monthly expansion of $600 million in the three previous months which
followed the June-July bulge, A large rise in the first half of the
month was followed by a slight decline in the second half when U.S.
Government deposits rose much more than usual. Over the August-
November period, money supply increased at an annual rate of 4.6 per cent,
a little faster than the 3,9 per cent over the first 7 months of 1964.
Seasonally adjusted time and savings deposits at all commercial
banks increased $1.8 billion in November, considerably more than in
other recent months but the same as in November last year. The annual
rate of growth in these deposits through November was 12.2 per cent
compared with 14.7 per cent over the year 1963.

III -11
Growth in savings deposits appears to have been the major
contributor to the large recent rise, presumably reflecting in part
reduced drains on savings for the purchase of new automobiles. These
deposits at city banks continued to rise faster in November than in
the corresponding weeks a year ago. Moreover, total time and savings
deposits at banks outside leading cities, 70 per cent of which are
savings, showed an appreciable rise this November in contrast with
declines in earlier years. Other time deposits at city banks, however,
declined somewhat in November whereas last year they had increased.
A further moderate expansion in foreign time deposits and in CD's
at banks in New York and Chicago offset only in part the redemption
of Christmas Club funds and a decline in outstanding CD's at outside
banks.
Bank reserves, Free reserves averaged $10 million over the
five weeks ending December 2 compared with $90 million in October.1/
In the last two weeks of the period, however, free reserves averaged
$55 million, compared with small average net borrowed reserves (revised)
in the three previous weeks. In the two most recent weeks, borrowings
averaged $265 million, following much higher levels in early November,
and excess reserves also dropped to an average of $320 million.
Prior to the increase in the discount rate, the effective
rate on Federal funds in November was never below 3-1/2 per cent and on

ending in the month as used in the reserve memorandum to the FGMC,

several days was 3-5/8 per cent. From then through December 8, it
fluctuated between 2-1/2 and 4 per cent, being at 4 per cent on four
days and at lower rates on six days.
Seasonally adjusted reserves required against private demand
deposits rose at an annual rate of less than one per cent in November
following an increase at an annual rate of 5 per cent in October.
Reserves required against U.S. Government deposits rose in November
compared with declines in most other recent years.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
U.S. balance of payments. The U.S. payments deficit in the
fourth quarter now appears likely to be held down as a result of the
sterling crisis. Data available through mid-November provided little
in the way of conclusive evidence of movements of U.S. capital from
Britain to the U.S. as a result of growing uncertainties about the
pound. In the week of the most acute pressure on sterling, however,
a substantial U.S. payments surplus was recorded,
The speculation against sterling engaged in by U.S. residents
-may have taken several forms: movements out of sterling into other
currencies or more probably into Euro-Dollars (some advance hedging
of this sort is suggested by the data on dollar claims on foreigners
in October, reported below); delays in payments for imports, direct
investments, etc., or short-term borrowing in sterling to make
such payments; and repatriation of funds and short-term investments,
Movements into Euro-dollars would not affect the U.S. payments deficit
whereas leads and lags and repatriation of funds would tend to reduce
the deficit. The unwinding of such speculation may well take some
time, given the continued uncertainties about sterling. Some
allowance will need to be made for such inflows of U.S. capital in
interpreting the fourth quarter balance of payments figures.
Another factor tending to hold down the fourth quarter
deficit may be a higher level of merchandise exports than earlier
expected. Exports remained high in October, after allowance for the

IV -2
distortions of the figures introduced by acceleration of shipments in
September in the face of a threatened port strike. Exports in
September-October averaged nearly $26 billion at a seasonally adjusted
annual rate, and were 7 per cent higher than the average for the first
half of the year. A small part of thid increase resulted from some
concentration of deliveries of new jet aircraft in October, Imports
in October were unchanged from September after seasonal adjustment.
The trade surplus in these two months accordingly averaged $7.$
billion at an annual rate, about $1 billion higher than in the first
half of the year.
The $220 million increase in bank-reported claims on foreigners
in October mainly reflected outflows of bank credits to Europe and to
Latin America, Out of the $120 million increase in long-term bank
credits, nearly half was to a wide range of countries in Europe and
represented a continuation of the pattern of earlier this year.
Outflows of short-term bank credit to Europe, principally Germany and
Italy, totaled $0 million. In addition, there appears to have been
some shifting of liquid claims on the U.K. reported by banks: claims
in sterling (mainly deposits) fell $13 million while dollar claims
(probably Euro-dollars) rose $21 million.
Developments in international financial markets.
Announcement of the $3 billion international assistance
package to Britain stopped the massive run on sterling, but uncertainty
about the position of the pound has persisted in foreign exchange
markets.

IV -3
The spot rate for the pound has remained fairly stable at
slightly above $2.79, but the forward discount is still above 2-1/2
per cent per annum, thus shutting off movements of arbitrage funds
to London. While the extreme uncertainty about sterling, which
obtained at the end of November and pushed the discount on one-day
forward sterling as high as 13 per cent, has disappeared, the Bank
of England has still found substantial intervention necessary in
both the spot and the forward markets for sterling. Despite these
actions, the forward discounts have failed to narrow significantly;
and the market continues to be threatened by potential large offers
of sterling.
Reactions in financial markets abroad to the increase in
Britian's Bank rate and the ensuing discount rate changes in the U.S.
and Canada have for the most part been limited to the markets directly
affected,
In Britain, short-term market rates have risen by amounts
approximately equal to the increase in Bank rate, or almost 2
percentage points. The increased gross interest advantage of British
short-term investments over comparable U.S. investments was, initially,
swamped by the increase in the discount on forward sterling; for 3-
months contracts the discount rose from nearly 1 per cent per annum
on November 19 to more than 2-3/4 per cent per annum on November 25.
This widening of the forward discount apparently prevented any signifi
cant movement of short-term funds into sterling from U.S.
dollar assets. Since December 1, the Bank of England has intervened

in the exchange markets to effect a narrowing of the forward sterling
discount, but this narrowing has not fully eliminated the covered
spread on Treasury bills in favor of New York. However, rates on U.K,~

IV -5
hire purchase paper and on local authority deposits were subsequently
marked up sharply with the result that the covered yields on these
investments are now higher than before the rise in Bank rate.
The attractiveness of covered short-term investments in
Canadian dollar paper seems not to have been altered by the changes
in discount rates. Both before and after the discount rate changes,
Canadian finance company paper has held about a 35 to 40 basis point
covered advantage over similar US. instruments.
Direct reactions of other short-term rates abroad were
negligible except in the Euro-dollar market. Rates on 90- and 180-day
Euro-dollar deposits in London rose by 1/2 per cent to 5 per cent
immediately after the increase in ceilings payable under Regulation Q.
By early December, however, these rates had eased somewhat. Movements
out of sterling into Euro-dollars may have prevented a larger rise in
these rates such as might have occurred in sympathy with the rate
advances in the London money market and in anticipation of the
year-end tightness in the Euro-dollar market,
In Japan, action was taken late in November to forestall a
possible withdrawal loss of Euro-dollar deposits from Japan as a
result of the increase in Euro-dollar rates in London. The rates that
Japanese foreign exchange banks are allowed to pay on these deposits
were raised by from 25 to 88 basis points, with the largest increase
applying to one-month deposits.
Long-term interest rates in Britain have shown only modest
net increases over the past two weeks. There has, however, been a

IV -6
good deal of fluctuation in bond yields and in stock prices as well,
stemming from uncertainty about the application of the Government s
proposed capital gains tax to government securities and the extent
and amount of the proposed corporate profits tax. Changing expectations
regarding these measures have been largely responsible for a shifting
back and forth by investors between government securities and equities
and for the resultant fluctuations in prices of both. On balance,
yields on long-term Government bonds have risen by a little less than
20 basis points. Share prices, except for an initial fillip,
continued to fall and on December 8 were nearly 9 per cent below the
high reached on October 1.
Prices of long-term government bonds in Canada fell immediately
after the discount rate increase, but regained most of the decline in
the following week. During this period fairly large shifts in holdings
of these securities also took place. Large sales by the public were
probably connected with seasonal purchases of Canadian Savings Bonds,
but may also have represented bearish expectations about future bond
prices in Canada. These sales were met by purchases by commercial banks
and by the Bank of Canada.
In other major markets, the crisis in sterling and the
resultant policy actions have had very little effect on long-term rates.
Yields on long-term bonds in several Continental markets changed by
'only about one basis point.

APPENDIX A: INTERNATIONAL INTEREST RATES, MID-1963 TO NOVEMBER 1964
I. Even with the rise in Federal Reserve discount rates in July 1963, differ-
entials in market yields between European financial centers and the United
States did not narrow on short-term maturities--and actually widened on
long-term--from mid-1963 to October 1964.
1. Early in 1963, credit markets in most European centers had been comfort-
able but, after mid-year, one by one, European monetary authorities
moved toward policies of active restraint.
a, A rapid recovery in European output in the second and third quarters
of 1963, accompanied by accelerated rises in both wholesale and
consumer prices, were responsible for these policy shifts,
b. Credit conditions continued to tighten in Europe during 1964 except
in Italy where, as a calculated risk, a shift to monetary expansion
was initiated in August and in France where a slight relaxation in
the degree of stringency was allowed.
2. In this period, changes in market yields do not fully mirror the changes
which actually took place in credit conditions in several countries; for
attempts were made to cushion the impact of credit curbs on domestic mar-
kets to minimize unwanted inflows of funds from abroad.
a. In Germany, for example, where the banks have had to reduce their
liquid asset holdings and increase their rediscounts at the central
bank, the rediscount rate was kept at 3 per cent despite a rise in
day-to-day money to nearly 4 per cent in late September and most of
October; all market rates would undoubtedly have risen more had the
rediscount rate been increased.
b. In France, there was a large inflow of funds from abroad during
much of May 1964 when day-to-day money rates in the Paris market
rose above 6 per cent; as a result, the French authorities have
not allowed the 6 per cent level to return.
3. On international short-term obligations, European rates moved up about
as much as did yields in the United States but finance paper in Canada
moved up somewhat more (after allowance for covering in the forward market,
a. The 3-month Euro-dollar deposit rate exceeded the yield on U.S.
CD's by 57 basis points at the end of June 1963 end by 55 basis
points on October 30, 1964. (See Table 1.)
b. But the Canadian finance paper rate (covered) was above yields on
U.S. paper by 24 basis points in mid-1963 and 32 basis points in
October 1964; U.S. short-term investment funds moved into Canada
during this period,
c. At the same time, the covered yields on Treasury bills rose as
follows: United States, by 56 basis points; United Kingdom, 76;
and Canada, 26.

A -2
4. By contrast, long-term rates rose by 33 to 92 basis points in
European centers compared with a 15 point rise in the United States.
(See Table 2.)
a. In addition, European long-term rates moved closer together:
Switzerland and the Netherlands--in historic shifts in policy--
abandoned their attempts to maintain levels of rates much below
those in neighboring countries.
b, As a result, the stability and the lower absolute level of U.S.
long-term rates contrasted conspicuously with developments in
Europe during this period.
II. Discount rate and associated changes during November 1964 have thus far
(on December 5) had the effect of increasing the gaps between U.S. and
European market rates.
1. The initial movements of short-term rates have been varied:
a. The spread of Euro-dollar deposit rates over CD's rates had widened
about 27 basis points (to 82 points) on December 4. (See Table 1);
b. The covered spread on Canadian finance paper had risen by 8 basis
points (to 40 points)on December 4; and
c. Covered yields on U.S., U.K., and Canadian Treasury bills have
come close together, in part because of a wide discount on forward
sterling.
2, On long-term bonds, up to November 27 U.K. yields had risen about 17
basis points but only fractional changes had been reported in other
major markets. (See Table 2.)
a. Uncertainties about the outlook for sterling prevented the emergence
of the kinds of heavy flows into British bonds which occurred in
late 1960 and 1961,
II. Interest rate developments abroad up to October and during November have
been in the direction of encouraging a shift in financing from European
to U.S. centers.
1. For short-term borrowings, the recent rises in Euro-dollar rates (and
reduced European domestic credit availabilities since late 1963) have
made borrowing in the United States less unattractive to European
residents.
2. On the long-term side, there have been substantial marketings of long-
term U.S. dollar bonds in European centers since the IET proposal,
absorbing an important part of the flow of funds in Europe for this
type of investment.

A -3
a. The Japanese Government has shut off further Japanese private
flotations in Europe to make room for issues of Japanese govern-
mental bodies, and it is reported that Japanese borrowers have
been asking the Japanese Government for permission to make new
issues in this country, despite the IET.
b. No significant volume of European issues has yet been sold to
investors subject to the tax. One issue, privately placed, had
a 35-month maturity. Only two issues this year will have been
listed on the New York Stock Exchange. One, already issued,
carried a yield attractive only to European investors, who are
not subject to the tax, and the other will not be offered at all
to U.S. investors.
3. European residents are borrowing (or refinancing) with U.S. bank
loans, exempted from the IET.
IV. Thus far, despite the advances in yields there, we have no evidence of
pick-up in the flow of U.S. funds into European financial markets. Bank-
reported statistics of course do not yet go beyond October nor corporation-
reported data beyond the month of September,
1. Because of the clouded sterling outlook, uncovered yields in London
are not now drawing U.S. funds. At present, foreign funds are also
not entering the London gilt-edged market in the hopes of capital
gains from a turn-around in yield trends (such as occurred in 1961).
2. Rates on Euro-dollar deposits are quite attractive at the moment,
although this may prove to be in part a year-end phenomenon. We have
as yet no evidence that additional U.S. funds are being placed directly
with European banks or indirectly moving to European markets through
Canadian banks.
V. The impact of recent discount rate changes in flows of U.S. funds into
Canada is not yet clear.
1. Movements of U.S. funds which occurred in October and November (prior
to the central bank rate actions) are believed to have been mainly
into U.S. dollar deposits with Canadian banks which aimed to build
up balance sheet totals at yearly publication dates (end-October for
most and end-November for two banks).
2. The incentive to hold Canadian over U.S. finance paper was slightly
larger on December 4 than on October 30. (See Table 1.)
3. On the long-term side, Canadian borrowers have ended their wait-and-
see on U.S. flotations and have recently entered our markets in volume.
Since the discount rate changes, the spreads of Canadian over comparable
U.S. bond yields have widened fractionally, suggesting a continuing
Canadian interest in the U.S. market.

SAPPENDIX B: FEDERAL EXCISE TAXES*
At the present time, both the Treasury Department and the
staff of the House Ways and Means Committee are making extensive studies
of Federal Excise taxes. Earlier this year, there was an unsuccessful
Congressional attempt to attach excise tax reduction as a rider to the
Administration tax reduction program. President Johnson has recently
stated that he will recommend at least removal of the retail excises,
and probably other excise cuts will be added to the list. Thus it may
be useful to review briefly the role that excise taxes play in the
Federal revenue system.
Uses of Excise Taxation. The Federal excise taxes are an
unbelievable hodge-podge. The Federal government has never used either
a general manufacturer's excise tax or a general retail sales tax, as
many European countries and many of our State governments do, but has
niposed taxes on a wide variety of individual items. They range from
the time-honored sumptuary taxes on alcoholic beverages and tobacco,
through the financing of the highway trust fund, to a three cent per
pound tax on the processing of coconut oil.
Many of the present excise taxes were passed during World War
II, primarily to restrain consumption, and retained in the post-War
years for revenue reasons. Although the individual excise taxes by
themselves are not large revenue producers, total receipts of such taxes
are a substantial source of revenue, averaging around 12 per cent of
total Federal revenue in recent years.
Leaving aside for the moment the revenue potential of the excise
taxes, there are several other functions that selective excise taxes can
perform. There has been traditionally a sumptuary use -- that is to
discourage the consumption of certain items which are considered socially
undesirable -- such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco -or which are
in scarce supply -- such as electrical goods and transportation and
communication services during World War II. Specific excise taxes have
also been used as a means of regulating certain types of activities.
The documentary stamp tax on the transfer of corporate securities, deeds,
etc., and the tax on the transfer of ownership of fire-arms are of this
sort.
Selective excise taxes also can be used as a generalized substi-
tute for user-charges. The taxes on gasoline, diesel fuel, and other
highway trust fund taxes are the outstanding examples of this type of

taxation. But there are others -- the Federal excise taxes on sporting
goods are ear.marked for grants-in-aid to the States for the development
of fish and wildlife and the tax on sugar is earmarked to pay subsidies
to domestic producers, supposedly to equalize the domestic and interna-
tional cost of production. I/
There havebeen major changes in Federal excise tax laws in
recent years. Federal taxes on entertainment services have been lowered
several times. The taxes on the transportation of oil by pipeline and
property (tax on the cost of shipping by railroad or truck) were repealed
in August 1958. The tax on transportation of persons by railroad and
bus was removed and the tax on air travel reduced from 10 to 5 per cent
in 1962. The tax on air transportation is now more nearly in the category
of being a user fee because the justification for keeping it was the
Federal aid program for airport construction and the air traffic control
system run by the C.A.B., although the funds are not ear-marked for such
services.
The decline in tax rates on some goods has been offset by
increases in taxes on other items. With the inauguration of the Federal
inter-State highway building program in 1956, the tax rates on trucks
and other highway related products were increased and a few new ones added.
The tax on gasoline and diesel fuel was again increased in 1959 and on
some of the other highway trust fund taxes in 1961. The changing pattern
of excise tax collections is shown in appended Table 1, where taxes have
been grouped as to whether they are primarily sumptuary, user fees, or
regulatory. 2/
Responsiveness of Excise Taxes to Economic Activity. Offsetting
changes in the tax laws have contributed to the comparatively stable
behavior of excise tax receipts which, in the past nine years, have grown
along with GNP, but at a slightly slower rate. But the question raised
by many observers has been whether or not the excise tax structure is
stabilizing in relation to the business cycle. One of the major criti-
cisms of the Federal excise tax structure in economic literature is:
1/ The Sugar Act receipts are scheduled for reclassification. In the
future, they will be included with custom receipts.
2/ This classification differs from that of the Treasury Bulletin which
is the source of the data. The Treasury classifies the taxes as
alcohol taxes; tobacco taxes; documentary and stamp taxes; manufactu-
rers excise taxes, retailers excise taxes and miscellaneouw excise
taxes.

B- 3
"... the relative insensitivity of the yields of present
excises to changes in national income...."
"According to some estimates, the change in the yield
of excise taxes is less than proportional to changes in
income. It is argued, therefore, that the excises fail
to meet what is now regarded as one important criterion
applied to elements of the Federal revenue system; namely,
that a tax should make a substantial contribution toward
automatic stabilization of the economy."3/
In an attempt to measure the responsiveness of the excise taxes
to changes in GNP, excise tax collections as a per cent of the GNP were
calculated by type of tax. As is shown in appended Table 2, total
Federal excises have been a remarkably stable proportion of GNP. 4/
This is partially the result of offsetting secular trends for some of the
excises and partially the result of changes in tax rates. However, revenue
from any one excise or even a group of excises is small compared to GNP.
Consequently, all the individual percentages are below 1.0 per cent, which
brings the importance for the economy of the variations into question.
The individual excise tax collections exhibit varying secular
and cyclical trends. It is interesting to note that among those excises
whose rates have been unchanged in the past nine years only the taxes on
alcoholic beverages and tobacco products have shown a relatively steady
tendency to decline a. a percentage of GNP, the trend which many observers
have attributed to all Federal excises. The tax on telephone service as
a per cent of GNP on the other hand, showed a fairly steady upward trend
until 1961, undoubtedly reflecting increased use of the service.
A good many of the excises -- the retail excise taxes, the
regulatory taxes, and the user fees for sports and sugar -- have been
fairly stable proportions of GNP, which indicates that they are responsive
to changes in general business conditions on a proportional basis.
3/ The Federal Tax System: Facts-and Problems 1964, materials assembled
by the committee staff for the Joint Economic Committee, 88th Congress,
2nd Session p. 153.
4/ Excise tax collections reflect the preceding quarters liability.
Rather than shift the collections to a liability basis, the annual
totals for GNP were calculated on a fourth to third quarter basis,
in order to relate the collections to the appropriate GNP. Quarterly
percentages were also calculated. The trends exhibited in the annual
data were also apparent in the quarterly series.

B -4
But the strongest cyclical pattern is displayed by the Federal tax on
motor vehicles, purchases of which are themselves strongly related to
the business cycle. In this case, tax collections have been a rising
percentage of GNP during expansions and a declining percentage during
contractions.
This.brief summary indicates how the economic impact of the
Federal excise tax structure depends on the changing demands for the
items subject to tax. Some of the tax collections have an evident cycli-
cal responsiveness. While it is difficult to evaluate the contribution
of the excise tax structure as a whole to economic stability, it seems
clear that the current excise tax structure at least does not have pro-
cyclical effects.
Excise Taxes in Relation to Other Sources of Revenue. Although
the Federal excises were originally enacted mostly for reasons other
than revenue, these taxes in total are a major source of Federal receipts.
Table 3 shows Federal cash receipts by type of tax, both in dollar amounts
and also as a per cent of total revenue for the fiscal years 1955, 1959
through 1964 and the current estimates for fiscal 1965. Total excise tax
collections, as mentioned earlier, have averaged around 12 per cent of
total cash receipts in recent years as well as being a fairly stable
proportion of GNP.
The three major forms of revenue -- individual, corporate,
and employment taxes -- as d proportion of total revenue and as a propor-
tion of GNP have been shifting in recent years and are scheduled to shift
more at the beginning of calendar 1965. The recent reduction in individual
income tax rates is apparent from the declining percentages in the last
two years as shown in the table. The reduced reliance on the corporate
profits tax is less apparent because the recent cyclical expansion is
corporate profits has caused the ratio of corporate tax receipts to GNP
to rise, even with the tax rate reduction. But looking back over a decade,
corporate tax receipts have shown a declining secular trend both as a
proportion of total Federal receipts and of GNP. In contrast, employment
taxes have been becoming relatively more important as a source of revenue.
Their share of total revenue has been rising since the mid 1950's and
is scheduled to increase even more in the next five years.
Possible Excise Tax Reduction. Should it prove desirable from
a fiscal policy point of view to reduce taxes further, reduction in Federal
excises are a frequently mentioned candidate for reduction. It seems a
reasonable assumption that any excise tax reduction would aim primarily
at removing the left-over World War II sumptuary taxes, since there is
no longer any economic reason for limiting the consumption of these items.

B -5
The ones most likely to be removed would be the retail excises and the
manufacturers' excise taxes (other than those earmarked for the
highway trust fund and sporting goods). In calendar 1963, total
collections of these taxes were nearly $3.1 billion--$444 million from
retail excises, $512 million from manufacturers' excises (other than
from highway taxes and automobiles) and $2,038 million from the taxes
on automobiles, parts and accessories. It seems doubtful that the
Federal taxes on alcoholic beverages, tobacco products and gambling
would be removed.5/
The argument usually made for removing the diverse retail and
manufacturers' excises is that they are frequently arbitrary and no
longer serve any national purpose except as a source of revenue.
However, an argument might be made that the taxes on automobiles, parts,
and accessoriesare something of a user fee although the receipts are
not specifically ear-marked for the Highway Trust fund.6 But if
the argument can be made that the other manufacturers' excises are
arbitrary and no longer functional, it can also be appled in urging
the removal of the Federal excise taxes on telephone service and the
remaining taxation of entertainment. It is difficult to detect any
large amount of special services provided by the Federal government
to the telephone companies or much of the entertainment world. Repeal
of the tax on telephone service and entertainment would result in an
additional revenue loss of approximately $1.0 billion.
Thus, the total amount of tax reduction available in the
present excise tax structure appears to be in the neighborhood of
$4.0 billion at the outside, assuming that the Federal taxes on alcohol,
tobacco products gambling, the regulatory taxes or the user fees--especially
the Highway Trust Funds taxes--are not reduced. However, there is
litte indication that the Administration will seek a tax reduction of
that size. It seems as if it is more likely to be in the neighborhood
of $2.0 to $2.5 billion, with the ultimate size dependent not only on
economic circumstances, but also on the various political and other
pressures that are brought to bear on the selection of individual excises
to be reduced.
2/ Some of the minor miscellaneous taxes may also be candidates for repeal--
such as the tax on the use of safety deposit boxes and playing cards. The
tax on sales and transfers of silver bullion was repealed in 1963 and the
tax on processed coconut oil has been suspended.
6/ As mentioned above, the Federal tax on air transportation has become more
nearly a user fee than a sumptuary tax.

B-6
Economic Impact. How much economic stimulus a reduction in
excise taxes would provide depends primarily on what would happen to
the prices of the items to which the tax now applies. If removal of
the excise taxes results in lower prices, the economic impact would
come from increased demand both for the previously taxed goods and for
all other goods and services, since the same monetary amount of personal
disposable income would enable consumers to purchase a larger volume
of real goods and services. This expansion in real income would
thereby lead to an expansion in the nation's output--with the magnitude
of the expansion depending in part on the degree to which consumers
allocated their increased real income between spending and saving.
If the tax reduction results in no reduction in prices of
previously taxed items, the entire amount of the reduction would be
absorbed as increased returns to the factors of production, but presumably
reflected primarily in increased corporate profits. Some of the higher
profits would be immediately returned to the government in the form of
increased corporate profit taxes, thus partially offsetting the immediate
economic impact of the tax reduction. Of the higher after-tax profits,
probably the largest part would go into corporate saving but it is
likely that some of it would be paid out as dividends and thus might
lead to some direct increase in consumption, but the amount undoubtedly
would be small. These assumptions woud probably lead to less of an
immediate increase in economic activity from the tax cut than would
occur if prices were reduced since consumers as a group are likely to
spend more of new accretions to income than are dividend recipients
and corporations. Corporations may be less likely to increase spending
and more likely simply to alter their means of financing by taking the
opportunity to reduce external borrowing.
Whether or not excise tax reductions would be accompanied by
immediate price declines depends partly on the particular excises which
are cut. The retail excises, the excises on entertainment, and the
excises on telephone services are explicitly added on at the retail
level. Removal of the telephone tax would probably result in an
immediate reduction in price, since it is a regulated industry. It is
less certain that the removal of the retail excises and the entertain-
ment taxes would result in price reductions, unless there was a good
deal of public discussion about the significance of the tax reduction
in relation to prices.
It is even more difficult to predict what the price effect
would be on the good subject to manufacturers' excise taxes. These
taxes are not explicitly added on at the retail level; consequently,
consumers, and possibly many retalers, are much less conscious of them.
Price decreases comparable to the tax reduction would depend, therefore,

B -7
on the state of competition in the industries currently subject to
tax. In the last fifteen years--with the breakdown of the Fair Trade
Laws and the development of discount houses--there has been considerable
competition and prices have been reduced on many of the items currently
subject to Federal manufacturers' excises. It seems reasonable to
assume that there would be some price reduction. However, because of
the small number of producers in the industries now subject to tax, the
price reduction might not be equal to the full amount of the tax
reduction unless, again, the relationship between tax reduction and
price reduction is publicly emphasized.
In comparing the economic impact of excise tax reductions
with the recent reduction in individual and corporate profits taxes, the
second stage of which is scheduled for next year, two points should be
kept innind. First, even if all the available excise taxes were repealed,
and this it unlikely, the total size of the reduction would be smaller
than the reduction in liability in either stage of the 1964 Revenue Act.
And second, uncertainties about the incidence of the excise tax cut--i.e.,
the extent to which it would be passed on to consumers in the form of
lower prices or absorbed into profits--make it more difficult to evaluate
its economic impact.
