IN BROAD REVIEW
As the new year begins, the U.S. economy is continuing to
move forward with each monthly step carrying it further into uncharted
areas beyond the guides of earlier peacetime cyclical comparisons.
Although the economy is now in the 46th month of this expansion period,
there are few signs of imbalance--except for the precautionary buildup
of steel stocks--of the sort that in the past preceded cyclical down-
turn. "Sustained moderation" still seems to be an accurate description
of the mood and the performance of the domestic economy.
Industrial production and employment expanded further at
year-end and unemployment apparently was little changed around its
reduced November level. Capacity utilization was higher than earlier
in the year, but new capacity was coming on stream in large volume
and was serving, along with competition from at home and abroad, to
maintain general price stability, with some increases but largely
of a selective nature. After advancing in October and November, prices
of industrial commodities at wholesale showed only a little further
increase in December. Consumer prices have given no indication of
accelerating their slow upward pace. Stock market prices were below
peak levels reached last autumn.
Meanwhile, the statistical information now available for
the fourth quarter as a whole underscores the effects of strikes and
strike threats. GNP, despite substantial increase in the rate of
inventory investment, was up much less than in preceding quarters.
Retail sales were somewhat disappointing and the personal saving rate

I- 2
rose to about the high second quarter rate reached immediately
following the tax cut. Industrial production for the quarter was
probably only half a per cent above the third quarter level, although
in December the index rose to a new high, 7 per cent above a year
earlier.
The labor market strengthened further in late 1964 but
hourly earnings in manufacturing did not show signs of accelerating
their earlier moderate rate of increase. Fringe benefits rose more
than cash wages, but unit labor costs in manufacturing were still
within the narrow range of the past year as productivity continued
to increase rapidly.
In the financial area, markets for corporate, municipal and
U.S. Government bonds withstood with minimum effects the sterling
crisis, the consequent disoount rate and Regulation Q actions and
the very large Treasury advance refunding announced at the end of
December. Initial market reception of the Treasury refunding was
favorable, and yields on Treasury bonds in early January were only
a little above a year earlier. Bill and other short-term yields
remained below the level reached immediately after the change in
the discount rate, but were considerably above a year earlier.
Bank credit and monetary growth moderated in December.
Total bank credit growth in 1964 was about 8 per cent, the same as
in 1963. The money supply was estimated to be up $400 million in
December, somewhat less than in other recent months, while growth
for the year was placed at 4.1 per cent as compared with 3.8 per cent

I-3
in 1963. Time and savings deposits rose substantially in December,
but the increase for the year was less than in 1963.
The U.S. balance of payments deficit totalled about $2.5
billion in 1964. The rate of deficit increased during the year from
a low $1 billion in the first quarter to about $4 billion in the
final quarter when the deficit was swollen by a bunching of
foreign security issues and by the British waiver of its service
payments on the 1947 sterling loan. These somewhat exceptional factors
nearly doubled the rate of deficit in the fourth quarter.
Abroad, the pound has remained under heavy pressure pending
the impact of the import surcharges and other recent measures to
improve Britain's payments position. In general, the economies of
the other industrial countries of Europe entered 1965 with aggregate
demand still strong and rising, although less buoyant than a year
earlier. Restrictive economic policies were being continued except
in Italy and Japan. Canadian economic activity by late autumn had begun
to advance again.

Most recently prospects have improved for a lessening of
upward pressures on prices in nonferrous metal markets. Tin prices
fell back more than half way from the October high after announcement
of an increase in the amount of the metal available from the stockpile.
More importantly, copper production has recovered from the strikes
and other disturbances of last summer, and recently prices in the
"free" markets have fallen sharply.
As the pressures lessen in some nonferrous metal markets, steel
producers have increased prices of galvanized products 2 to 3 per cent.
The effect on the index for steel mill products is likely to be less
than .3 per cent. Steel mill products account for about 5 per cent of
all industrial commodities. The important question is whether this
increase signals the beginning of a series of increases for steel. There
is no doubt that temporarily the market is strong enough to support
higher prices, owing partly to inventory demand arising from the threat
of a strike. The extent to which price increases effected now will
hold after the strike threat is over is uncertain. It will depend
importantly on market demand conditions but also on the amount of
increase in wages and fringe benefits provided in the new contract,
the extent of cost reduction being effected gradually by introduction
of new equipment, and the nature of foreign competition.
In 1963, prices were raised for most steel products, in two
stages, with an impact on the index for steel products of 2 per cent,
Prices of some products eased last summer, however, and even with the
latest rise, the index now is little more than 1 per cent higher than

II -4
early in 1963. In the three years 1955 through 1957, steel prices rose
at a rate of 8 per cent per year.
The consumer price index rose .2 per cent in November and for
the third consecutive month was 1.2 per cent higher than a year earlier.
According to BLS, easily figures indicate no change in Decemoer. If the
final figure is unchanged from November, the 1964 rise in the index
will be 1.0 per cent--the smallest increase since 1961.
Much of the November rise was attributable to autos. Prices
after discounts were seasonally higher for the new models; prices of
used cars increased contraseasonally because of fewer trade-ins during
the period when sales of new cars were limited by strikes; insurance
premiums for the new autos were up substantially. Apparel and fuel
increased about seasonally and foods changed little.

Labor maRket. Strength in trade and manufacturing apparently
pushed nonfarm employment up to new record levels in December. With

II -5
the labor force continuing to rise, however, unemployment probably
showed little change from the November rate of 5.0 per cent; the rate
in December 1963 was 5.5 per cent.
For 1964, as a whole, employment rose somewhat more than the
labor force and unemployment declined from 5.7 per cent to an average
of 5.2 per cent, the lowest for any year since 1957, when it was 4.3
per cent. Much of the decline this year was among adult male workers,
reflecting substantial increases in industrial employment during the
year, with demands for labor buttressed at year-end oy inventory
accumulation in the metal producing and using industries. For adult
males the unemployment rate averaged about 3.8 per cent in 1964,
compared with 4.5 per cent in 1963. At year-end, the rate was below
the average for the year. Rising activity and higher employment,
however, had little impact on the unemployment rate of younger workers.
Teenage employment was up some 300,000 in 1964, but about 15 per cent
of the teenagers in the labor force was unemployed, the same percentage
as in 1963, and a rate sharply higher than the 10.8 per cent in 1957.

In contrast to labor force increases of 1.1 million in 1963
and 1.2 million in 1964, the projected rise for 1965 is about 1.5
million. If this projection is realized, an increase in employment
this year comparable to the large gain of 1964 would not result in a
further reduction in unemployment, assuming continuation of current
productivity trends and hours of work. The expected sharper rise in
the labor force in 1965 mainly reflects an extremely large increase
in high school graduates entering the labor force.
Earnings and unit labor costs. The rise in hourly earnings
in manufacturing has shown no tendency to accelerate. In November,
at $2.56 an hour, earnings were about the same as in September; over
the 12 months from November 1963, hourly earnings increased 7 cents
or 2.8 per cent, about the same percentage as over the previous 12-month
period. Fringe benefits in manufacturing, represented by employer
contributions to social security, pension and other funds, have
continued to rise somewhat more rapidly than hourly earnings. Such
benefits increased 4.3 per cent per employee over the year.
Combining wages and salaries and fringes, total compensation
per employee increased about 3.3 per cent, close to the guidepost
target and somewhat less than the rise in productivity in manufacturing.
Output per manhour in manufacturing continued to rise in 1964 at
about a 4 per cent rate.
Labor costs per unit of output in manufacturing, which
reflect changes in both productivity and total compensation, declined
in November following a rise during the strike-affected months of
September and October. In December, with automobile output increasing

II -7
further, another decline in unit labor costs seems likely, to a level
not much different than that in late summer. On the whole, unit
labor costs remained relatively stable in 1964, showing no significant
trend.
Industrial relations. Although the New York Shipping
Association and the Longshoremen's union reached agreement on a new
4-year contract, there is uncertainty as to whether the contract
will be ratified by the union membership this weekend. In New York
and other East Coast ports questions of interpretation of various
contract clauses, especially those dealing with crew size have delayed
ratification. In Galveston and Houston negotiations over the size of
crews have not yet been completed. Members of the union in New York
are to vote on the proposed agreement January Q, and ratification in
other ports must oe completed by January 11. If the union members
fail to accept the contract, they would be free to strike.
The agreement over cargo gang size allows a reduction in
the size of crews from 23 to 17 men by October 1967. In exchange,
the contract provides for wage rate increases of 10 cents in both
October 1964 and 1965; and of 8 cents in both October 1966 and 1967--
the basic wage rate currently is $3.26 per hour. In addition, certain
union members with seniority are guaranteed 1,600 hours of work or pay
and an annual salary of $5,792. Cost of this provision will depend
on future employment conditions in the industry. Employers also
agreed to increase payments into the pension, health, and welfare
funds from 32 cents to 46-1/2 cents per hour. Paid holidays are
increased to 12 from 9, and workers with more than 12 years of service
receive a fourth week of vacation.

II -8
Consumers. Seasonally adjusted retail sales in December
(based on data for four weeks) rose sharply from the reduced October-
November level and may have exceeded the high reached last summer.
The sharp December increase in retail sales, like the preceding decline
was mainly attributable to autos, as supplies increased substantially.
Furniture and appliance sales apparently were up from November and
were near their June-July peak. Nondurable goods sales were up moderately
from the reduced November level, mainly reflecting gains at gasoline
and general merchandise outlets, and they were about at the high
of last summer.
Preliminary reports of sales for December by the three
largest producers of domestic autos were 13 per cent above a year
earlier, setting a record seasonally adjusted annual rate of over
9.0 million units. Despite the autumn strike, a record 7.6 million
domestic cars were sold in 1964, and at year-end dealer stocks were
not far from a year earlier. Adding the half-million imported
vehicles total sales will set a historic mark of 8.1 million new cars
for 1964.
For the fourth quarter as a whole, the increase in consumer
spending was quite small, the smallest of this long expansion period.
Purchases of goods apparently were down somewhat on balance, while
outlays for services continued their steady rise.
The failure of consumer spending to expand more last quarter
was primarily--but notentirely--attributable to limited availability
of autos for which expenditures were down substantially. Thus,

II -9
furniture and appliance sales were little changed from the preceding
quarter. Sales of nondurable goods were up only a little, in contrast
to sharp increases in the preceding quarters of 1964.
Meanwhile, personal income showed another substantial increase
in the fourth quarter notwithstanding loss of income because of the
auto strikes, and exceeded an annual rate of $500 billion.
With consumer after-tax income up $6 billion or so and
spending up only a little, the personal saving rate rose sharply from
7.1 per cent in the third quarter to around 8 per cent. This was
about the same as the high second quarter rate when the tax cut was
first effective for an entire quarter.
Orders for durable goods. New orders for durable goods
declined 1 per cent in November, as orders for defense products declined
sharply. New orders for civilian products showed a substantial rise
but remained below earlier highs because strikes continued to limit
activity in the auto industry. New orders for machinery and equipment
(a special Census classification of producers' equipment industries)
rose further in November recovering to about the record May-June
level. New orders for primary metals remained at advanced levels.
The level of new orders remained somewhat above shipments
in November and the backlog of unfilled orders continued the expansion
that began last January.

II -10
Business inventories. Changes in inventory investment are of
key cyclical significance and for this reason the recent acceleration
in accumulation of stocks is of special interest. Inventory accumulation
has accelerated at manufacturers since mid-1964--owing in part to the
emerging steel stock build-up--but distributors' inventories were
about unchanged from June to September and then dropped sharply in
October because of the General Motors' strike. The October decline at
distributors was enough to offset an extraordinarily large rise at
manufacturers. Thus, total business inventory accumulation was quite
small in the summer and early fall,
In November, the pace of over-all inventory accumulation was
stepped up sharply, as manufacturers' stocks continued to rise rapidly
and as auto stock rebuilding at dealers began. Present indications
suggest continuation of a high rate of accumulation in December and in
early 1965 as the build-up of steel and auto stocks proceeds. Moreover,
recent inventory data suggest that manufacturers generally have stepped
up accumulation--at least through the fourth quarter--in part as
a make-up for the very low rates in the first half of 1964, when
stock-sales ratios declined.
The book value increase at manufacturers in November totaled
$500 million. This amount, on top of a $750 million increase in October
(revised upward $200 million from the preliminary figure) resulted in
an exceptionally large two-month increase. Manufacturers in the
November survey had reported expectations of only a $1.2 billion
accumulation for the fourth quarter as a whole and this has now been
exceeded in October and November alone.

The auto strikes contributed significantly to the unusually
large October increase at manufacturers; in that month inventories in
the auto industry increased abruptly by about $200 million as parts
accumulated and auto plants took delivery of steel even when auto
assemblies were shut down. Some reversal of this rise may have occurred
in December and the rate of total accumulation by manufacturers may
have slowed somewhat. Nevertheless, it now appears likely that the
fourth quarter increase appreciably exceeded manufacturers' anticipations.
Over two-thiids of the rise in manufacturers' inventories
during October and November occurred in durable goods industries, and
within these industries, materials, work-in-process, and finished
goods shared about equally. However, the increase in stocks of materials
represented a pronounced step-up from earlier rates of gain and
reflected in part a speed-up in accumulation of steel.
Stocks held by nondurable goods producers increased $350
million from the end of September to the end of November. This increase
was about in line with producers' anticipations and brought the book

II -12
value of such inventories from a level slightly below, to a level
still only moderately higher than at the end of 1963.
Manufacturers' sales rose in November, following a decline
in October, and were somewhat above September. The rise in inventories
considerably exceeded the sales increase from September to November,
however, and the over-all stock-sales ratio rose from 1.64 to 1.66.
At 1.66 the ratio was back close to last winter's levels before the
decline last spring and summer, but the November ratio was still
below the average levels in 1963 and 1962.
Residential building. Seasonally adjusted housing starts,
which had advanced sharply in the two preceding months, dropped in
November to a new low for 1964. On a three-month moving average,
however, the annual rate in September-November, at nearly 1.5 million
was unchanged from the preceding period, but appreciably below the
recent high reached in the autumn of 1963.
In contrast to starts, seasonally adjusted residential permits
rose in November with permits for l-to-4 family buildings accounting
for all of the rise. Permits for 5-or-more-family structures, which
had been moving toward a record peak at this time in 1963, declined
further.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL SITUATION
U. S. Government securities market. Prior to the Treasury
advance refunding announcement on December 30, yields were edging
higher in the Treasury bond market, as the market reflected discussion
of Treasury financing possibilities involving longer-term issues and
also continuing concern over the international position of sterling.
By December 30, yields on issues with 5 years or more to maturity had
returned close to the levels reached shortly after the November discount
rate action, but yields on shorter-term coupon issues remained below
such levels. This rate pattern resulted in part from dealer efforts
to work down their holdings of Treasury bonds due in more than 5 years,
which declined from $225 million on December 15 to $135 million on
December 30, and to increase their holdings of shorter-term coupon
obligations. By the end of 1964 yields on Treasury securities were
generally above year-earlier levels; the yield curve had flattened fur-
ther, however, as yield increases over the year varied from 31 basis points
for the 3-month bill to just one basis point on 20-year bonds.

The demand for intermediate- and long-term Treasury securities
that kept longer-term yields relatively stable in 1964 has continued in
evidence in the first trading days of 1965, contributing to the favorable
initial market reception accorded the Treasury's advance refunding. In
that offering, a total of $33.1 billion of securities due from February
1965 to November 1967, including $22.1 billion held by private investors,
was made eligible for exchange into new 4's of February 1970, new 4-1/8's
of February 1974, or the reopened 4-1/4's of August 1987-92. Downward
price adjustments on the outstanding bonds surrounding the new issues
were relatively small following the announcement, partly because the
financing had been anticipated and largely discounted.
One question raised by an advance refunding of this magnitude
is the likely downward impact on short-term interest rates stemming from
reinvestment demand by sellers of the "rights." After the announcement,
it became more attractive to sell the "rights" as they generally rose in
price by around 4/32 or 5/32 by Tuesday. As a result, an associated
demand for bills began to appear, but it was seemingly of moderate pro-
portions.
The usual seasonal demand for bills also began to develop
following the mid-December tax date, contributing to the subsequent
reduction in yields on Treasury bills. Bill rates declined despite a
tighter Federal funds market and higher dealer borrowing costs at money
market banks; the latter were partly offset, however, by the large
volume of repurchase agreements made by the System during the second half
of December and in early January at 3-7/8 per cent. In the January 4
auction the average issuing rate on 3- and 6-month bills fell to 3.83 and

III -3
3.92 per cent respectively, after having been around 3.87 and 3.96
per cent in the previous three auctions.
The Treasury's announcement that it would shortly be offer-
ing $1.5 to $2.0 billion of June tax anticipation bills should help to
maintain upward pressure on bill rates in coming weeks. The Treasury
may also raise additional cash by adding to the regular weekly auc-
tions of bills. In total, the Treasury may need to raise around $2.5
billion in cash by mid-February, but thereafter it should be in a posi-
tion to retire debt out of the first half year seasonal surplus.
The next regularly scheduled Treasury financing will involve
the balance of the February maturities that are not exchanged in the
advance refunding. This refinancing will probably be announced in late
January and will no doubt involve a short-term coupon offering so as
not to interfere with market absorption of the advance refunding issues.
Corporate and municipal bond markets. Corporate and municipal
bond markets have remained steady since mid-December. Forces tending to
increase yields--such as the anticipation and subsequent announcement of
the Treasury advance refunding, the unusually heavy volume of municipal
offerings in December, and the unexpected addition of $200 million World
Bank bonds to the January calendar--have apparently been fairly well
balanced by offsetting forces--such as the continued paucity of corpor-
ate bond offerings, the usual turn-of-the-year pickup in flows of
investment funds, and some lessening of the crisis atmosphere regard-
ing the British financial situation.
At the start of the new year, yields on high grade municipal
bonds are at the lowest level since May 1963, 10 basis points below the

II -4
sterling crisis high of late November and some 12 basis points below a
year ago. With yields on U. S. Treasury and high grade corporate bonds
at levels close to or above a year ago, spreads within the structure of
long-term yields have widened, particularly the one between high grade
municipals and U. S. Governments. This latter differential has grown to
more than 1-1/8 percentage points; in absolute size this is slightly
larger than the previous peak spread that prevailed between these two
series in early 1951, shortly after the Korean War excess profits tax
was introduced. At that time, however, all bond yields were at con-
siderably lower levels.
The further decline of yields on municipals relative to other
types of bonds since the sterling crisis apparently reflects market
expectations that bank interest in municipal issues will be stronger--as
a result of the late November change in Regulation Q. Recent increases
of rates paid on commercial bank time and savings deposits have improved
the competitive position of many banks vis a vis other savings institu-
tions and are expected to encourage bank investment in assets that pro-
vide more favorable returns.

Firmness persisted in municipal bond prices du:ing December,
even though the supply of new offerings totaled over $1 billion, a record
for any December and the second largest monthly total in 1964. New
supply is expected to drop back to about $850 million in January, with
the bulk of offerings concentrated in the latter half of the month. Antici-
pation of this January financing pattern, in combination with turn-of-the-
year reinvestment demands, apparently encouraged dealers to take on
December offerings. Although the blue list of dealers' advertised inven-
to ies swelled to nearly $730 million late in December, it has since
fallen below $700 million.

Continued stability in the corporate bond market has reflected
chiefly the scarcity of new publicly-offered issues. In the final quar-
ter of 1964 the monthly volume of such offerings averaged only $170 mil-
lion, roughly half the monthly average for the preceding 9 months; and the
January supply is expected to remain quite light. While the volume of
private placements appears to have been at record levels recently--and
for the year may have accounted for more than five-eights of total new
corporate bond offerings--the supply of publicly-offered issues seems
to exert the major impact on published bond market yields.
Stock market. Common stock prices, after approaching their
lows for the month, staged an active two-day rally at the very end of
1964, as investors sought to reinvest funds accumulated from earlier
"year-end" selling. On the first trading day of 1965, prices turned
down again on low volume, but after the President's State of the Union
message most of this first day decline was recovered.
Standard and Poor's composite index of 500 stocks closed at
84.63 on January 5, up from the December low of 83.22, but 2 per cent
below the record November 20 high of 86.28. In addition to concern
about the future prospects of sterling, the general hesitancy of stock
prices in recent weeks has apparently reflected continued uncertainty
about the likely course of wage costs and corporate profit margins in
1965.
During 1964 the Standard and Poor's index rose 13 per cent,
which compares with gains of 19 per cent in 1963 and 24 per cent in 1961.
Roughly nine-tenths of the 1964 advance occurred in the first 6-1/2 months.
The limited further rise in the latter half of the year was accompanied
by more erratic swings in prices.

III -7
Mortgage markets. Mortgage markets continued little changed
in the latter part of 1964 and, with mortgage funds remaining ample, trade
expectations are for maintenance of this trend into 1965. In November,
secondary market yields on FHA-insured mortgages remained at 5.45 per
cent, an average which--with slight exception--has prevailed for nearly
two years. Contract interest rates for conventional home mortgages also
held at earlier reduced levels--5.80 per cent for loans on new homes and
5.85 per cent for loans on existing houses.
Foreclosures on nonfarm real estate--mainly homes--dipped
slightly from the second to the third quarter of 1964, reflecting a drop
in foreclosures of government-underwritten mortgages and a moderate
further rise in foreclosures on conventional mortgages. These shifts
appeared to be largely seasonal, however. On a year-to-year basis,
third-quarter foreclosures on government-underwritten and conventional
mortgages combined were 13 per cent higher than in 1963 when they were
also 13 per cent higher than in 1962. But in the preceding years, rates
of increase had been higher, as the table shows.

Bank credit. Growth in city bank credit over the four weeks
ending December 23 was somewhat smaller than in the corresponding weeks
of most other recent years, as a larger-than-usual loan rise was offset
in part by a contra-seasonal reduction in holdings of U.S. Government
securities. These holdings declined substantially in early December,
reflecting in part secondary distribution of Treasury issues acquired
in the late November financings, but they subsequently rose somewhat
as is usual.

While the credit rise reported through December 23 was
relatively moderate and the usual temporary year-end credit bulge
was probably similar to other years, there may have been an additional
short-lived increase on December 31, when $3.2 billion maturing
Treasury bills were exchanged for new bills. Net bank acquisitions of
these bills along with associated borrowing by security dealers may

III -9
have resulted in a larger year-end credit rise than in other years
when bill financing was not concentrated on the year-end date. Based
on these assumptions, the December increase in seasonally adjusted total
credit at all commercial banks is tentatively estimated at $1,5-2.0
billion, bringing the total growth for the year to about 8 per cent, the
same as in 1963.
Business loans at city banks over the four weeks ending
December 23 increased $1.1 billion, almost twice as much as the
substantial rise in the corresponding weeks last year. Borrowing was
unusually heavy in the week of December 2, presumably in part to cover
anticipated tax and dividend period needs in advance of a possible
increase in the prime rate, and again in the week of the 16th, which
included both the dividend and tax payment dates. Both corporate tax
and dividend payments were larger this year than a year ago, and there
were no maturing tax securities in either year.
Borrowing over the four weeks by public utilities, metals
companies, and petroleum and chemicals companies was larger than in
the comparable weeks of any other year following some slackening
during the autumn. Bank purchases of bankers' acceptances and loans
to the service industries also were unusually large. On the other
hand, borrowing by food processors and repayments by commodity dealers
and trade concerns appeared to be about seasonal proportions.
Security loans, which had been high at the time of the Treasury
financing in late November, rose less in the four weeks ending December 23
than in the corresponding weeks of other recent years. Dealer loans on

III -10
U.S. Government securities showed a small contra-seasonal decline while
other security loans rose somewhat less than usual. Loans to nonbank
financial institutions rose about in line with the large December increases
of other recent years. An unusually large increase in "other loans"
reflected city bank purchases of practically the entire $450 million
Export-Import Bank participation certificates sold in late November.
Money supply, turnover, and time deposits. The seasonally
adjusted money supply increased $400 million in December, or at a some-
what slower rate than in the August-November period. Expansion was
substantial in early December, but slackened in the second half of the
month. U.S.. Government deposits at commercial banks showed little
change on a seasonally adjusted basis. Over the year, the money
supply rose 4.1 per cent compared with 3.8 per cent in 1963.
Turnover of demand deposits at 343 centers outside New York
averaged 35.5 in November, the same as in October but 5.7 per cent
above a year earlier. Since the April peak, turnover has fluctuated
within a relatively narrow range and has shown no discernible trend.
Seasonally adjusted time and savings deposits at all
commercial banks increased $1.4 billion in December, well below the
sharp $2 billion November rise but somewhat above the substantial rates
of gain in the August-October period. Most of the increase occurred
in the first half of the month, reflecting in part an unusually large
inflow of State and local government funds in the New York and San
Francisco Districts; growth moderated in the second half. Since July,
expansion has been at an annual rate of 14.3 per cent, considerably

III -11
faster than earlier in the year. Over the entire year, time and savings
deposits increased 12.6 per cent compared with 14.7 per cent in 1963.
At weekly reporting banks growth in savings deposits in
December exceeded last year's expansion by a wider margin than in the
three preceding months. Time deposits, contrary to the recent trend,
also rose more than in the corresponding weeks last year, but this
reflected the sharp rise in deposits of State and local governments
referred to above. Outstanding CD's have been showing divergent movements
since early November--declining rather steadily at New York City banks and,
except for a temporary tax-period decline, expanding at banks outside.
Outstanding unsecured notes of banks have declined in recent weeks to
a total of $92 million on December 30 from a high of $123 million on
November 25, just after the Regulation Q ceilings were revised.
Bank reserves. Free reserves averaged $139 million in December
compared with a nominal level in November and an $86 million average
in September and October. Member bank borrowings at $278 million
in December were down substantially from their temporarily high $413
million average in November and were also somewhat below levels of
the two previous months. Meanwhile, excess reserves at $417 million
in December were close to the average of other recent months. In
the last statement week of the month, both borrowings and excess reserves
were temporarily high as is usual at this time of year.

III -12
Except for five days in early December, the effective rate
on Federal funds was consistently at 4 per cent in the December reserve
period. Some transactions took place below the 4 per cent rate on
11 days of that period, all prior to December 17.
Seasonally adjusted reserves required against private demand
deposits rose at an annual rate of over 5 per cent in December, about
the same as in October and in contrast with a small decline in November.

U.S. balance of payments. The over-all deficit on regular
transaction in the balance of payments in 1964 now appears to have
totaled $2.5 billion. Preliminary estimates of the major elements in
this outcome, which compares with a $3.3 billion deficit in 1963, are
shown in the following tabulation together with the corresponding
figures for 1963 (in billions of dollars):
1964 1963
Exports 24.8 22.0
Imports 18.6 17.0
Trade Surplus +6.2 +5.0
Net services, etc. +0.8 -0.1
Balance on above +7.0 +4.9
Government grants & loans (net) -3.7 -3.9
U.S. private capital (net) -5.8 -4.3
Foreign non-liquid capital +0.4 +0.4
Errors & omissions -0.4 -0.3
Balance on regular transactions -2.5 -3.3
As is shown in the table, there was a marked expansion of net receipts
from goods and services transactions to a record total of $7 billion but
also a very large rise in the outflow of U.S. private capital. The
resulting deficit was financed to a much greater extent than in 1963 by
a rise in liabilities to foreign commercial banks and other non-official
holders: the rise in these liabilities totaled approximately $1.5
billion and was perhaps in considerable part directly related to the

IV -2
increase in capital outflows. The balance financed by changes in reserves
and in liabilities to foreign official holders and by special transactions
was about $1 billion, compared to $2.7 billion in 1963. The gold stock
declined $125 million in 1964.
The further expansion of the trade surplus in 1964 reflected a
continuation during the year of the high rate of exports to Europe and
Canada attained at the end of 1963, a rise for the first time in several
years in exports to Latin America and a continued increase in shipments
to other nonindustrial countries. These gains outpaced a rise in
imports of about 10 per cent for the year as a whole. These trends
appeared to be continuing throughout 1964 with perhaps some renewed
advance in exports to Europe and Canada towards the end of the year.
There was also in 1964 a very large increase ($600 million) in net
income from foreign investments, which accounted for most of the im-
provement on service transactions.
The outflow of private capital was at record or near-record
levels throughout the year. The increased outflows of the first half
of the year were mainly of short-term capital -- bank credit and liquid
funds. Outflows of short-term capital diminished in the second half of
the year, while out-flows of long-term bank loans and on foreign
security issues increased. The higher level of new foreign security
issues was concentrated in the fourth quarter and consisted mainly of
Canadian issues; many of these issues had apparently been postponed
until uncertainties about the passage and application of the interest
equalization tax were resolved. The outflow of long-term bank loans to

IV -3
foreigners totaled over $800 million in 1964, up nearly $300 million from
1963; available information indicates a significant step-up in commitments
on these loans after mid-year.
Data on the fourth quarter are still incomplete, but on the
basis of the information available, the over-all deficit is estimated at
roughly $1 billion for the quarter, or $4 billion at an annual rate.
This annual rate would represent an increase of nearly $2 billion from
the $2.3 billion deficit in the third quarter. About $1-1/2 billion of
this increase (in annual rate terms) results from the bulge in new
foreign security issues and another $1/2 billion from Britain's failure
to make its usual end-of-year payments (the amount actually involved is
$138 million). Excluding these exceptional factors, the deficit would
have been of the order of $2-1/2 billion in the fourth quarter, or about
the same rate as for the year as a whole.
The British position. The Bank of England gave substantial
support to both the spot and the forward exchange rates throughout
December. The rate for spot sterling was maintained slightly above
$2.79 and the discount on 3-months forward sterling was prevented
from widening beyond 2.7 per cent per annum except on 2 or 3 days. To
provide a measure of relief to the reserve position, the British
Government exercized its right to waive its end-of-year payments of
$174 million of interest and principal on the U.S. and Canadian loans.
This together with substantial utilization of the facilities made
available under the $3 billion international assistance package allowed
official reserve losses in December to be limited to only $28 million.

IV -4
British financial markets during December were affected by the
continued movements out of sterling, further adjustments to the rise in
Bank rate, continued uncertainties about prospective taxation of capital
gains and company profits, and indications of a credit squeeze by the
Bank of England. On December 9, the Bank of England addressed a letter
to the commercial banks which requested the banks to exercise more
selectivity in granting advances; lending for real estate development
and for consumer finance were singled out for curtailment. Moral suasion
of this sort has worked with indifferent success on previous occasions,
except when coupled with measures to reduce over-all bank liquidity. In
the December 9th letter, it was suggested that the Bank of England would
not provide much relief to the banks' liquidity positions during the
period of seasonal strain in February and March. As of mid-December,
the liquid asset ratio of the banks was 30.6 per cent, a relatively low
ratio for that time of year. During the preceding month the banks had
been net sellers of long-term government securities and of Treasury bills
to improve their cash position and to increase their loans; clearing
bank advances as of mid-December were up nearly 15 per cent from a year
earlier.
In mid-December, prices of long-term government securities
began to fall sharply, after showing fairly modest declines in the two
weeks following the rise in Bank rate. Markets became disorderly and
on December 17 the Government broker announced that all maturities of
government bonds would be supported at the then existing prices; this
policy is apparently still largely in effect as bond prices have

IV -5
changed little since then. Over the two-week period ending December 18,
yields on long-term government bonds rose by 10 to 35 basis points, the
largest increases being for the shorter maturities. In part, the fall
in bond prices resulted from bank selling and from movements of funds
out of sterling, but also purchases by institutional investors have
reportedly been restrained by uncertainty about the application of the
proposed capital gains tax to government securities. Other interest
rates also moved up in December: rates on automobile loans by finance
houses from 8 to 9 per cent, and building society rates on home loans by
1/4 per cent. On the other hand, the Treasury bill rate remained at
6.41 per cent throughout December and has since moved up only 3 basis
points. In view of the recent Bank of England support of the government
securities market, it is not clear how severe the credit squeeze has
been so far.
The Government is evidently pinning much of its hopes of
solving Britain's economic problems on its "incomes" policy. On
December 16, representatives of labor and management agreed to a
government-sponsored "declaration of intent" to keep increases in wages
and other money incomes in line with productivity gains, to keep prices
stable, and to increase industrial efficiency. However, wage settlements
in the last two months have generally exceeded the expected guideline
of 3 to 3-1/2 per cent per annum; the most important of these has been
the settlement with the 3 million workers in engineering industries
which provides for a 4 per cent per annum increase in wages over the
next three years. This was the lowest such settlement since the war but

IV -6
is still likely to raise costs; however, the agreement does provide for
the first time the possibility of reducing restrictive labor practices
in these industries.
Economic indicators released during the past month confirm the
earlier picture of an economy operating at high levels of resource
utilization with upward pressures on prices accompanied by severe balance
of payments difficulties. In October, the index of industrial production
(preliminary) moved up 2 percentage points after showing no change for
ten months. In November, the unemployment rate remained at 1.5 per cent;
imports and the trade deficit continued at record rates; and prices
increased further to levels around 4 per cent higher than a year earlier,
The balance of payments deficit in the third quarter on current and
long-term capital transactions totaled nearly $800 million bringing the
deficit for the first nine-months to $1.7 billion.
Selected developments elsewhere. The German economic situation
continues to be characterized by gradually increasing production, heavy
pressures on resources and prices, and a declining trade surplus.
Industrial production in September-October was up 2 per cent from the
second quarter and up 6 per cent from a year earlier. In the same two
months, new industrial orders remained on the average at the same high
level as in the previous six months, Despite the easing of order back-
logs, heavy pressures on productive facilities persist: in November,
job vacancies fell less than seasonally and were still 4.5 times the
number of unemployed; producer prices of industrial products rose a
further 0.3 per cent and were 2.4 per cent above a year earlier. The

IV -7
seasonally adjusted trade surplus disappeared in November as imports
rose further whereas exports were no higher than last spring; compared
with a year earlier, imports were up by 25 per cent while exports were
up by only 5 per cent.
French industrial production in October was again unchanged
from the levels attained in the spring. Among the elements in the
leveling of output has been a decline in automobile production; demand
for automobiles has been limited by the consumer credit restrictions
adopted in the fall of 1963 and an apparent increase in the saving rate
of the consumer sector. Another element in the slackening of activity
has been the sluggishness of exports: in September-October, exports
were no higher than the rate reached very early in the year. The labor
market also continued to ease in October, with unemployment rising and
job vacancies declining.
In Canada, seasonally adjusted indicators of employment,
construction activity, and retail sales point to a continued rise in
economic activity in October and November. Employment in mid-October
slightly exceeded the previous peak reached in April and was 2 per cent
above year-earlier levels while unemployment declined in November to 4.3
per cent of the labor force, the lowest rate since mid-1957. Residential
construction starts in October were 40 per cent above March-April levels
and the number of dwellings under construction was up 9 per cent.
Retail sales in September, spurred by heavy demands for automobiles,
reached a new record and were 6 per cent higher than a year earlier.

APPENDIX A: REVISION IN NONFARM PAYROLL DATA*
The Bureau of Labor Statistics has revised its nonfarm
payroll estimates for employment, hours, earnings, and labor turnover.
The revision reflects: (1) the adjustment to March 1963 employment
benchmarks provided by employer reports to the State Unemployment
Compensation Insurance programs, supplemented by data for small firms
and nonprofit organizations from the Old Age and Survivors Insurance
program; and (2) the adjustment to the October 1962 Census of
Governments for State and local government employment; and (3)
revision of seasonal factors.
The new benchmark lowered the estimated level of nonfarm
employment by 530,000 (Table 1), or 1 per cent,for March 1963.
The major change was in State and local government where the 1962
benchmark data were the first available since 1957. The level of
employment in this sector was decreased by nearly 5 per cent. A
reduction of 1-1/2 per cent occurred in construction. In manufacturing
the revision was negligible--less than 0.1 per cent. For all industries,
except for State and local government, revisions were carried back to
1962. Figures for State and local government and, therefore, for
total nonfarm employment were revised back to 1957. In the new series
the gain in nonfarm employment between 1957 and 1963 was reduced to
3.7 million from the earlier published 4.3 million, or to an annual
rise of about 600,000 rather than 700,000.
Nonfarm employment in October 1964 in the new series was
59.2 million (unadjusted) or 630,000 lower than in the old series
(Table 1). Manufacturing and construction accounted for 150,000
of the reduction, trade and service for 140,000 and State and local
government for 360,000. The benchmark revisions had very little
effect on the level of average weekly hours, average hourly and weekly
earnings.
The revision of the seasonal factors had relatively little
effect on monthly changes in total nonfarm employment, as may be
seen in the chart.1/ The new seasonal factors mainly affected the
pattern of increase in manufacturing employment. In the new series,
manufacturing employment increased only 1.2 per cent from January to
July 1964 compared with a 1.7 per cent rise reported in the old series.
*--Prepared by Jane Moore, Economist in National Income, Labor and
Trade Section.
1/ The revisions for the seasonally adjusted employment series have
been carried back to 1953. Revised back data will appear in the
December Employment and Earnings publication of the Bureau of
Labor Statistics. The November 1964 data released in December
were on the revised basis.

A-2
In contrast a larger increase occurred between July 1963 and January
1964 in the new series, reflecting a revision in the seasonal factors
for this period (Table 2). As a result the revised series shows a
somewhat stronger upward trend in the last half of 1963 than previously,
and not quite as sharp a rise earlier in the year.
