IN BROAD REVIEW
The domestic economy in late January still appeared to be
heading upuard on its broadly noninflationary course, but in the
international area fourth quarter retrogression in the U. S. balance
of payments has raised doubts about the adequacy of measures taken
so far to reduce the payments deficit.
Some signs of domestic imbalance seemed more prominent
than 3 weeks ago. The current pace of new auto sales to consumers--
around a 10 million annual rate in January--is hardly sustainable
for long. Similarly, the continuing rate of steel production--now
close to 140 million tons a year and well above current advanced
rates of use--cannot be maintained for many months. Possibly, an
industrial stock average around the 900 level on the Dow-Jones scale
is another indication of potential imbalance, although the recent
stability, and more recently decline, in stock market credit points
towards large cash demands for equities.
The official economic messages again reflect the stamp of
modern-day fiscal theory which gained new support from the apparent
success of the tax cut in 1964. Particularly noteworthy is the
sharply stimulative fiscal policy indicated for the second half of
this calendar year, when steel and auto output may well be consider-
ably lower.
Information newly available since early January indicates
a rise in the Board's production index although not nearly so sharp
as in December. A further increase in retail sales from the record
December level seems likely for January. Industrial commodity prices

I- 2
were inching upward in mid-January at the very slow pace of the
preceding month, and in free markets for copper earlier speculative
enthusiasm was being dampened by increases in supplies.
In December, new housing starts rose considerably above
their reduced November level to an annual rate of about 1.5 million
units. New orders for durable goods and order backlogs rose further
despite a decline in defense orders. Personal income increased
appreciably further to well above $500 billion, annual rate. Employ-
ment gains were large in December. Unemployment held at the
5 per cent level, but this represented considerable improvement
from a year earlier. Unit labor costs in manufacturing, aided by
rising productivity, were lower than in December 1963.
In financial markets, the large Treasury refunding was a
notable success and so far appears to have had little-effect on
interest rates. Both U. S. Government and other long-term rates
continued generally stable or moved a little lower, while the
3-month Treasury bill rate continued to fluctuate around the 3.80
per cent level.
City bank credit, after allowance for usual seasonal
changes, has increased substantially thus far in January. Loans
have declined much less than usual and banks participated heavily
in the Government's recent financing operations.
The money supply increased $800 million further in the
first half of January following a rise of only $300 million in the
month of December and an average expansion of about $500 million a
month, or a 4 per cent annual rate, since August. Time and savings

I-3
deposits showed an unusually sharp increase in the first half of
January, following very large increases in the final quarter of
1964.
The U. S. balance of payments deficit in 1964 now appears
to have totaled $3 billion. Very large outflows of short-term capital
occurred in December, totaling $500 million; these appear to have
included some temporary loans and movements of funds to meet year-end
pressures in the Euro-dollar market. Fragmentary data showing U. S.
payments surpluses so far in January suggests a reversal of some of
the December outflows.
In the past two weeks, foreign exchange markets have been
relatively quiet. Early in the month, the announcement of the large
gold purchase by France from the U. S. had produced some speculative
activity and the London gold market was confronted with heavy demands.
Pressures on sterling have eased since the publication of the foreign
trade figures for December, which showed a smaller deficit than
earlier.

THE DOMESTIC ECONOMY
Industrial production. Industrial production in December
rose to 137 per cent of the 1957-59 average from 134.8 per cent in
November. Much of the increase was accounted for by a sharp rise in
output of autos, trucks, and automotive parts, Output of most other
consumer goods, as well as of business equipment and materials also
increased in December,
While some further increase in industrial production is
anticipated in January it will not be nearly so large as the December
rise. Auto output, which rose from a seasonally adjusted annual rate
of 7.4 million units in November to a record 9.4 million rate in December,
has changed little in January. Steel ingot production, which increased
steadily in the previous three months, declined on a seasonally adjusted
basis in January. Trade reports indicate that rolling mills are
operating near capacity. Among other goods, there may be some cutbacks
in production for export as railroads have embargoed transit of goods
to East coast ports,
The increase in industrial production in 1964 for the third
successive year was above the average rate of growth for the postwar
period, 1947 to 1961, which included four recessions. As shown in
the table, all three major market groupings showed above average
increases in the latest three years, with the exception of equipment
in 1963. The increases were especially large in 1962, following the
1961 recession.

Materials 3.7 7.9 5.7 7.0
Retail sales. Retail sales in January, based on data for
the first two weeks, appear to be up slightly from their record
December level. Sales at both durable and nondurable goods outlets
are showing gains. Among nondurable goods stores brisk sales are
being reported at apparel, drug, and general merchandise outlets.
Among durables, furniture and appliance sales are up slightly.
On a unit basis, sales of new autos for the first 20 days
of January shattered earlier records. If maintained at this pace for
the remainder of the month, seasonally adjusted sales in January will
be around a 10 million annual rate, including imports. This rate is
moderately above the advanced December level and sharply higher than
a year earlier. Dealer stocks of new autos continue moderately
below a year earlier and are unusually low in relation to sales.
Orders for durable goods. New orders for durable goods rose
5 per cent in December to the highest level in five months. The rise
reflected mainly a sharp gain in the auto industry as it fully
recovered from the effects of the autumn strikes and reached record

II -3
levels. New orders for primary metals and fabricated metal products
also increased in December after being reduced somewhat in October and
November. In the strategic producers' equipment sector, new orders were
maintained at the record rate first reached last May. Defense orders
declined further.
A large rise in shipments--particularly in the auto and primary
and fabricated metal industries--accompanied the new order increase,
and the backlog of unfilled orders for durable goods showed only a
small further gain in December.
Over the year 1964, however, unfilled orders increased 15
per cent, as compared with a 6 per cent rise in 1963. As the table
shows, stepped-up increase in unfilled orders came mainly in primary
and fabricated metals and machinery and equipment. Sales were also
up substantially last year (11 per cent) and the ratio of unfilled
orders to sales of durable goods showed only a slight increase.

Residential building. Seasonally adjusted housing starts
increased in December from the reduced November level, and the fourth
quarter average was moderately above the third quarter. The annual
rate was 1.5 million in December, the same as the total for the year.
Building permits, which tend to lead starts, declined during the fourth
quarter, thus raising some question about the sustainability of the
rise in starts.
For the year 1964, starts were down only moderately and,
except for 1963, were the highest since 1955. For the year, both
single-family and multi-family units showed similar relative declines.
The decline in multi-family units, however, was especially significant
in part because such units had accounted for most of the expansion
in total starts during the preceding three years and in part because
their attrition continued throughout the year. In December permits
for multi-family units were the lowest since mid-1962.
Among regions, the decline in starts in 1964 was concentrated
in the West which had led the expansion in 1963. Starts in the
Northeast and South changed little in 1964 from 1963, while in the
North Central states they rose sharply.

I/ Data for regions include 10,000 public starts; all data are preliminary.
Gross national products Gross national product in the final
quarter of 1964 was at an annual rate of $633.5 billion, up $5 billion
from the preceding quarter, according to the preliminary Department of
Commerce estimate. The increase in total outlays was only half as
large as the $10 billion gain in each of the preceding three quarters,
with the shortfall largely attributable to sharply reduced auto output.
Final purchases of goods and services increased less than
$2 billion; this compares with increases averaging $11 billion in the
three earlier quarters. On the other hand, inventory accumulation
increased sharply to an annual rate of $6.0 billion, notwithstanding
curtailments resulting from the auto strikes in October and November.
In the first three quarters inventory accumulation had averaged $3.0
billion.
Personal consumption expenditures in the fourth quarter increased
on balance by only $1.6 billion; spending for autos decreased nearly
$3 billion from the third quarter and spending for nondurable goods

11 -6
increased only $1.3 billion. At the same time, consumer after-tax
incomes rose $6.4 billion. Consequently, the ratio of personal saving
to disposable income increased sharply to 8.1 per cent from 7.1 per cent
in the third quarter, which was about the average for the past decade.
For 1964 as a whole, gross national product is now estimated
at $622 billion, $38.5 billion or 6.6 per cent more than in 1963.
In constant prices, gross national product was up 4.7 per cent as
compared with gains of 3.4 per cent in 1963 and 6.4 per cent in 1962,
the first full year of expansion after the 1960-61 recession.
Personal income. Personal income showed an unusually large
increase in December--$3-1/2 billion--to an annual rate of $506
billion. Wages and salaries were up $2 billion from November,
reflecting further increases in employment, particularly in construction
and durable goods manufacturing. Corporate dividends were up $700
million, reflecting larger than usual year-end extra payments.
Other types of personal income were little changed.
For the year 1964, personal income totaled $491 billion,
$27 billion or 5.9 per cent more than in 1963. Wages and salaries
were up 6.2 per cent,
Employment. At year-end, the labor market was strong. In
nonfarm activities over 200,000 persons were added to payrolls in
December with gains fairly widespread among industries.
Most significant has been the rapid rise in both employment
and the workweek in durable goods industries. December employment in

11 -7
hard goods industries was 100,000 above September; the workweek, at
almost 42.0 hours, was up more than one-half hour and was one of the
longest in recent years. Extensive overtime at automobile plants
was a major factor in this lengthening.
In contrast, employment advances in nondurable goods
industries have been moderate and the average workweek has remained
relatively stable; it was close to 40 hours a week in December, the
same as a year ago,
Further gains in construction employment were also reported
in December, reflecting mainly continued good weather. In trade and
private and public service activities, increases in employment
continued strong.
Over 1.8 million workers were added to nonfarm employment
over the past year. This compares with gains of 1.4 million during
1963 and 1,2 million during 1962. The increase in manufacturing
employment last year was much sharper than in earlier years,
especially for production workers. Employment increases in non-
manufacturing industries last year were about in line with their trends.

Unemployment. Unemployment in December was 5.0 per cent of
the civilian labor force compared with 4.9 in November and 5.5 per cent
a year ago,- The current rate, although below that of recent years,
is about the same as in the spring and early summer of 1959, when
steel inventories also were being built up rapidly. The unemployment
rate again fell to about 5 per cent in early 1960, when industrial
activity expanded following the steel settlement.
Unemployment of married men is relatively low; the December
rate of 2.6 per cent compares with 3,3 per cent a year earlier. While
fluctuating from month-to-month, unemployment for teenagers has
shown little net change at around the 15 per cent level. Teenage
employment, however, increased almost 300,000 in 1964, about the same
amount as their labor force growth,
Labor costs. Unit labor costs in manufacturing declined to
97.0 (1957-59=100) in December as output expanded sharply. The cost
index in December was lower than in any other month in 1964. For the
year as a whole, unit labor costs averaged somewhat below 1963. Taken
together, wage and fringe benefits per employee in manufacturing
advanced about 3.4 per cent from 1963 to 1964. This was below the
rise in output per manhour in manufacturing of 4.2 per cent, as implied
by the Board's production index, and about in line with the guideposts
based on trend productivity in the private economy of 3.2 per cent
a year.

data.

Industrial relations. Although New York longshoremen last
week voted to accept a new contract, ports along the East and Gulf
coasts remained on strike for a third week. The union rule is that
no port returns to work until all have settled. In some instances,
the local unions are demanding more favorable terms than provided in
the New York contract while in others employers have refused to accept
the guaranteed wage or the minimum crew size provisions of the
contract. There are 60,000 men on strike.
With bargaining in the basic steel industry recessed until
February 15, the steel union leadership shifted its primary efforts to
the major can companies in hope that an early settlement could be
obtained prior to the union election on February 9. The companies,
however, requested that negotiations be postponed until after the
election. The contracts in the can industry expire on March 1. The
union proposals include higher wages and increased job security but
no indication has been given as to the size of the package. An early
settlement with the can companies might provide a contract pattern
that could be adapted to the basic steel industry. The acceptance by
the can companies of an extended vacation plan in 1962 was followed by
adoption of a similar plan by the steel industry the next year.
Wage rate increases specified in contracts negotiated in
previous years will be received by 3.7 million workers during 1965,
or 1.3 million more than last year. Negotiation of long-term contracts
in the automobile, farm equipment, and trucking industries in 1964
account for most of the additional workers receiving such increases.
In the first quarter of 1965 deferred increases affect 1 million

II -10
nonmanufacturing workers. Soft coal miners and nonoperating railroad
workers have already received increases and in February 300,000
truckers will receive wage gains averaging 8 to 10 cents an hour,
Almost 1.7 million manufacturing workers will receive automatic raises
this year, including increases for most employees in the electrical
equipment industry in April and for workers in the automobile and farm
equipment industries in September or October.
About the same number of workers as last year will be
involved in new wage negotiations this year as a result of contract
expirations or wage reopenings. In addition to the steel and can
industries, major contract negotiations are scheduled in rubber,
shipbuilding and aircraft.
Two million workers are covered by agreements providing
for cost-of-living adjustments in 1965, about the same number as in
1964 and 1963, but only half the peak 4 million at the end of 1958.
The decline reflects the greater stability in the consumer price
index in recent years and increasing worker interest in job security.
Cost-of-living adjustments for workers covered in 1964 were 3 to 4
cents an hour. Most of the covered workers are concentrated in the
auto, aircraft and meat packing industries, although a few are in
chemicals, retail trade and public transit. Escalator clauses were
eliminated from the steel workers' contracts in 1962 and from the
railroad contracts in 1960.
Prices. The comprehensive wholesale price statistics for
mid-December confirm a rise of .1 per cent in industrial commodities

II -11
from a month earlier, following increases of .2 per cent in November
and .4 per cent in October. The weekly estimates indicate an additional
.1 per cent rise to mid-January. At 101.5 per cent of the 1957-59
average, the industrial price level in mid-January was a half of 1
per cent above a year ago, 1 per cent above 2 years ago, and equal to
the high reached in the first quarter of 1960.
Wholesale prices of foodstuffs were unchanged in December
and then showed a slight seasonal rise to mid-January. The current
level is about 1 per cent lower than in this season of the preceding
4 years. The combined index for foodstuffs and industrial commodities
in mid-January, at 101.0 per cent of the 1957-59 average, was unchanged
from a year ago and at the upper end of the narrow range through which
it has fluctuated during the past 7 years.
Recovery in prices of petroleum products, which accounted
for a large part of the rise in the industrial average in the early
autumn, has continued. In mid-January, prices for these products were
up more than 5 per cent from September and were back to the level of
January 1964.
Prices of nonferrous metal products also rose further in
December, and the whole nonferrous group was then up 15 per cent from
its level in the first quarter of 1963, before the rise began. Since
mid-December, copper prices have fallen sharply on the London and
New York exchanges, as a result of progressive improvement in supplies,
although they are still above prices maintained by primary producers.
Speculative enthusiasm in nonferrous metal markets generally appears

II -12
to have been dampened by proposed legislation to release large
quantities of surplus metals from the U.S. stockpile.
No further price increases have been announced for steel
products. There have been reports, however, that list prices have
been discontinued for some products, and on a negotiated basis, prices
are said to be higher than formerly. The BLS price index for finished
steel products in the week ended January 19, at 102.9 per cent of the
1957-59 average, was unchanged from late December. The index was
102.2 at the low in September and was 103.1 in January 1964.
By mid-December, prices of lumber and plywood averaged about
4 per cent lower than last spring before residential construction
activity weakened. At the year-end, prices were reported to be going
up because of the threat to supplies posed by the floods in the North-
west.
In markets for textile mill products, prices have been edging
up in response to strong demands for inventory as well as current
consumption. Early last year, prior to enactment of "one price
cotton" legislation, buyers of cotton yarns and fabrics had sharply
reduced their purchases and their inventories in anticipation of lower
prices. Since mid-1964, they have been rebuilding inventories and
order backlogs have increased appreciably. Prices of cotton textiles
have increased about 1 per cent since summer. Moreover, they are
less than 1 per cent lower than a year ago although the effective
cost of raw cotton is down about a fourth as a result of the one-price
cotton legislation and a reduction in Federal support levels. Prices

II -13
of fabrics made with synthetic fibers also have edged up while prices
for some of the fibers have been reduced.
Land values. Farm real estate values rose 1.5 per cent during
the 4-month period ending on November 1, 1964 (confidential) bringing
the total advance for the year (November to November) to 7 per cent.
Land values increased 6 per cent in 1963 and 5 per cent in 1962.
Values rose in every region with the sharpest advances in the Southern
areas and the smallest in the Corn Belt.
The rising trend in land values is in contrast to net farm
incomes from farming which have held stable for four years. Cash
receipts from the sale of farm products, the only 1964 income figures
available as yet on a regional basis, averaged slightly less than 1963.
In some regions, changes in land values were somewhat related to income
changes. Thus, in New England, a profitable year for potato growers
may have sparked the 5 per cent rise in land values following a year
of stability. Similarly, in the Corn Belt reduced cash receipts for
corn and grain sorghums and for cattle and calves may have moderated
the rise in land values. The 30 per cent higher direct payments to
farmers during the year may have had a stimulating effect even though
legislative authority for these payments is temporary.
Easier credit for farm mortgages also may have contributed
to the rise in land values. Farm mortgage debt expanded more rapidly
in 1964 than in the preceding year. Keen competition among commercial
lenders with ample funds to invest apparently resulted in some
lengthening of maturities on farm real estate loans and in smaller

II -14
down payments. Easier credit policies of commercial lenders may have
caused the first interruption since 1946 in the uptrend in the proportion
of credit sales seller-financed by land contracts.
Periodic surveys indicate that the market continues to be
dominated by demand for land for farm enlargement. In 1963, two-
thirds of farm transfers were to active farmers, 15 per cent to tenants
and 51 per cent to owner-operators. The owner-operators are generally
progressive farmers buying land for farm enlargement. They are often
willing to pay a relatively high price for additional tracts of land
in order to spread overhead costs. Nonfarm uses also have affected
land prices. Extension of urban areas and building of highways have
boosted prices in adjacent areas of land used for agricultural purposes.
The actual supply of land in farms has been reduced only 2 per cent
in the five years since 1959, while the number of farms has decreased
18 per cent,

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL SITUATION
Federal budget. While Federal expenditures projected for
fiscal year 1966 as recorded in the administrative budget are just
under $100 billion, the President's budget message outlines a program
which by many conventional measures is somewhat more expansionary than
in the preceding two fiscal years. Most of the expansionary thrust
comes, however, in the first half of fiscal 1966--that is, in the
July-December 1965 period,

Receipts 114,7 116.0 121.0
Expenditures 113.5 121.0 127.0
The proposed Federal fiscal program as reflected in various
measures of the budget is summarized in the table above. There, it
can be seen that while a somewhat smaller deficit is anticipated in
fiscal year 1966 for the administrative budget, the cash budget
contains a deficit--at $3.9 billion--virtually unchanged from the
1/
year before.- This unchanged deficit is accompanied, however, by
1/ The fiscal 1965 cash deficit of $4 billion is somewhat higher than
the $3.5 billion figure reported in the appendix to the November
25 green book, which was the official estimate at the time.

II -- 2
a $6 billion rise in cash payments proposed for the coming fiscal
year, in contrast to a $1 billion rise in the current fiscal year.
A similar rise in expenditures is also scheduled for the Federal
sector of the national income accounts, but with a somewhat enlarged
deficit at the same time.
Larger Federal spending is projected mainly for trust funds
and for health, labor, welfare, and education programs; a virtually
constant level of spending is expected for defense and space taken
together. As to credit programs reflected in the cash budget,
higher projected loan disbursements are just about offset by in-
creased asset sales and loan repayments.
Receipts in the cash budget are projected to rise about in
line with expenditures, reflecting in large part continued growth in
GNP. A proposed cut in excise taxes, effective July 1, is expected
to result in a net loss of $1.1 billion in revenue in fiscal 1966,/
but this would be more than offset for the fiscal year as a whole by
a projected $2 billion rise in revenue expected in January-June 1966
through already scheduled and newly proposed increases in social
security taxes (including funds for medicare) effective January 1,
1966.
The pattern of expenditures and receipts implied by the
budget leads to a larger than usual swing within calendar year 1965--
from a first half surplus in the cash budget that is close to earlier
1/ The proposed cut reduces excise taxes by $1-3/4 billion annually,
but of this amount only $1.5 billion will be reflected in fiscal 1966
due to timing of collections. This amount will be partially offset
by a proposed $420 million increase in excises that are considered
to be user charges.

III -3
projections at $6.6 billion (seasonally unadjusted) to a July-
December deficit of $13 billion, as shown in the table below.
While the distribution of the budget by half-years is still prelim-
inary and conjectural, these figures suggest a second half deficit
larger than in July-December 1964 and in the order of magnitude of
that obtaining in 1958, when, of course, GNP was considerably smaller.
The projected deficit assumes that Congress passes the Presidential
program as requested, including particularly increased social
security benefits payable in the second half of calendar 1965 retro-
active to January 1, 1965 and increased social security receipts that
do not begin until January 1, 1966.

III -4
A similar pattern is indicated for the budget program as
it is reflected in the national income accounts and in measures of
the full employment surplus. In the former case, a deficit of $4.5
billion (seasonally adjusted annual rate) in January-June 1965 is
followed by an $8.2 billion deficit in the second half of the
calendar year, as expenditures rise fairly sharply and receipts,
affected by the proposed excise tax cut, grow more slowly.
The fiscal stimulus provided the economy as measured by the
full employment surplus also increases in the second half of the year,
when the surplus falls to only $300 million from a relatively low
$3 billion in January-June 1965. It should be kept in mind, however,
that there is a sharp snapback in the full-employment surplus to around
$6 billion in the first half of 1966 in reflection of higher social
security taxes. Such a movement would represent a greater swing
toward surplus than is likely to occur between July-December 1964 and
January-June 1965, when the surplus is projected to rise by just
over $1 billion.
U. S. Government securities market. Treasury bond yields
have declined since the Treasury closed the books on its highly suc-
cessful advance refunding. Yields on most issues currently are close
to their levels of mid-December when they began to adjust upward in
anticipation of a possible advance refunding in January. The unex-
pectedly large exchanges by public holders in the advance refunding,
1/ Between $600 and $700 million of the decline in the full employment surplus
is due to the lump-sum payment for increased social security bene-
fits that retroactively covers the first six months of the year.

III -5
notably for the 4-1/4's of 1987-92, have generally been interpreted
as an indication of the strength of investment demand and confidence
in current interest rate levels rather than as overspeculation by
dealers and other temporary underwriters.
Since the completion of the advance refunding, dealers
have reported good investment demand for the new bonds. Some selling
by speculative holders has also been in evidence, but it has been
readily absorbed so far. There have been no purchases by official
accounts in the coupon market since the books were closed, except for
some relatively small and routine transactions for Treasury investment
accounts.

Public and dealer participation in the two most recent Treasury
advance refundings resulted in record exchanges, which are shown in the
tables. While dealers have made better initial progress in distribut-
ing their acquisitions in the current refunding, they came out of the
advance refunding with much larger holdings of the 4-1/4's of 1987-92
and remain relatively more exposed in the over-20-year maturity area.

Treasury bill rates have fluctuated irregularly so far in
January. Rates on the shortest maturities, in particular, moved
higher during the period and 30-day bills rose from around 3-1/2 per
cent in late December to 3-3/4 per cent on January 26. On the other
hand, seasonal demands for bills in the 3-month area and re-investment
demand for longer bills from sellers of rights to the advance refunding-- II 1 l

III -7
created market scarcities of these bills and some attendant down-
ward rate pressures. These pressures were moderated and then reversed
however, by the auction of $1-3/4 billion June tax bills on January
12 and $100 million additions to the weekly auctions starting
January 18. Also, a generally taut atmosphere in the money market
and associated relatively high dealer financing costs at money
market banks tended to maintain upward pressure on the bill market.
The Treasury's February refinancing will be a small oper-
ation, which is expected to involve an offering of a short-term
coupon issue to refund $2.2 billion of maturing bonds, including
$1.7 billion held by the public. Given the recent reduction of
short-term coupon issues because of exchanges in the advance refund-
ing and the current low dealer holdings of such issues, as may be
seen in Table B above, the February refunding is likely to be quite
routine.
Corporate and municipal bond markets. Markets for both
corporate and municipal bonds have continued to strengthen in recent
weeks. Yields on seasoned municipal obligations--which had started
to decline from their sterling crisis highs early in December--have
since eased further; currently, the series on high grade issues is
only 8 basis points above its six-year low reached in November 1962.
The first investment grade corporate issue brought to market since
early December was offered competitively last week at a reoffering
yield of 4.39 per cent (adjusted to a composite triple-A basis).

III -3
This was 8 basis points below the adjusted yield on the early December
offering, and close to the recent low reached in the new issue series
last July.

In the corporate bond market, the visible supply of new issues
continues to be relatively light for the near-term and inventories of
unsold bonds remain negligible. This supply situation, coupled with the
success of the Treasury's advance refunding, encouraged investors to
snap up the recent $200 million offering of World Bank bonds and to
bid prices of recently offered corporate bonds higher in the secondary
market.
The supply of municipal offerings in January is expected to
be substantial, but still about one-fifth below the unusually large
December volume. The largest offering of the month, the $124 million
issue of the City of New York, attracted substantial bank interest and
was about four-fifths sold on the day of offering. Generally aggressive

III -9
pricing of other January offerings, however, has resulted in slow retail
demand for some issues. Dealers' advertised inventories of unsold
securities, which had dropped to about $550 million early in the month,
have expanded to about $650 million.
The unusually large volume of State and local government
bonds sold in December raised the gross volume for 1964 to a new record,
3 per cent above the previous high set in 1963. Gross offerings of
corporate bonds, on the other hand, totaled about 5 per cent less than
in 1963--a year which included a substantial volume of publicly offered
refunding issues. While public offerings of corporate bonds dropped,
nearly 1/4 below 1963, private placements rose to a new record, one-
tenth larger than the previous high set in 1963. The bulk of this
year-over-year growth was attributable to an estimated record monthly
volume of private placements taken down in December.

Stock market. Common stock prices have recently reached a
new record high in above average trading activity. At its January 26

III -10
closing, Standard and Poor's composite index registered 86.9G, nearly
one per cent above its previous high of November 20 and 4-1/2 per cent
above its December low. Trading averaged 5.5 million shares a day
during the last two weeks, up 0.8 million shares from the daily average
in December.
Total customer credit in the stock market fell $55 million
during December as a further decline of $81 million in customer net
debit balances at brokerage houses more than offset a $26 million increase
in "purpose loans" at banks. In the thirteen months that have elapsed
since the raising of margin and retention requirements to 70 per cent,
customers' net debit balances with brokers have declined $507 million.
While this attrition has been partly offset by further growth in bank
"purpose loans," total stock market credit has contracted $245 million
over the period.
Shrinkage of stock market credit in a year of general stock
price advance is unique in the postwar period. In the past when margin
requirements were increased under similar circumstances growth in
stock market credit tended to slow or level off. But it never actually
contracted, so long as stock prices continued to rise. Undoubtedly,
the contraction in credit this time has reflected the simultaneous
increase in both margin and retention requirements.
Mortgage markets. Competition for mortgages by lenders has
continued active. In the secondary market, yields on FHA-insured,
30-year mortgages held at 5.45 per cent in December, marking the
twenty-second month of virtual stability. Contract interest rates for

III -11
conventional home mortgages also remained unchanged at the end of
1964, according to the Federal Housing Administration; the average
was 5.80 per cent for new home loans and 5.85 per cent for loans on
existing homes. Partly reflecting this stability, the spread between
yields on mortgages and yields on new Aaa corporate bonds has remained
unusually narrow.
In November, the latest month for which data are available,
average loan amounts for conventional mortgages were continuing well
above a year earlier, reflecting mainly increased buyer preferences
for upgraded new homes and higher-priced existing homes. While loan-
to-price ratios changed little, maturity terms for existing homes
also rose in November and were near a record high for the series.

Bank credit. Loans and investments at city banks declined
less than usual over the three weeks ending January 13 following a
relatively moderate rise over the earlier part of December. Loan
liquidation was considerably smaller than in most other recent years,
reflecting mainly contraseasonal expansion in security and business
loans. On the other hand, in the absence of the usual Treasury cash
financing in early January, holdings of U.S. Government securities
showed an unusually large decline. This was offset in part by a
contraseasonal rise in holdings of other securitiess presumably
reflecting delivery on the large volume of December offerings of
municipals. Holdings of municipal and agency issues had shown only
usual seasonal movements in December.

On January 18, not reflected in the above figures, commercial
banks acquired virtually all of the $1-3/4 billion June tax anticipation
bills,for which commercial banks could make payment up to 50 per cent
by credit to Tax apd Loan Accounts. On January 19, commercial banks
shifted $5.6 billion of issues maturing in 5 years or less into those
maturing in over 5 years through participation in the Treasury's advance
refunding 6 Banks acquired $2.8 billion of the 4 per cent bond of 1970, $1.8
billion of the 4-1/8 per cent bond of 1974, and $1,0 billion of the 4-1/4
per cent bond of 1937-92. The total exchanged was nominally greater than
the large volume exchanged in the July refunding; exchanges into the
longest bonds were almost twice as large.
Following a larger than usual rise in early and mid-December
business loans at city banks rose contraseasonally in the three weeks
ending January 13. Several major loan categories showed contraseasonal
increases or smaller than usual declines, including loans to metals
companies, public utilities, petroleum and chemicals companies,
service concerns, and all the seasonally oriented industries (food
processors, commodity dealers, and trade concerns). In addition, loans
to mining and crude petroleum companies rose more than usual. While
inventory accumulation may have contributed to these demands in some
categories, particularly metals, expanding investment outlays and
declining liquidity may have figures in others.
The contraseasonal rise in security loans was due mainly to
borrowing by Government security dealers in connection with the advance
refunding. Other security loans declined more than usual.

III -14
Money supply, turnover, and time deposits, The seasonally
adjusted money supply increased $800 million in the first half of January
following a moderate $300 million rise in December. The substantial
early-January rise was associated in part with a larger-than-usual
decline in U.S. Government deposits and the strong uptrend in business
borrowing. Since part of the money supply increase was in currency and
reserves against net interbank deposits declined, the growth in total
money supply was larger than the small rise in average seasonally adjusted
reserves against private demand deposits (which include those against
net interbank) would imply, Over the last five months of 1964,
following the June-July bulge, money supply growth averaged $500
million per month, an annual rate of 4.1 per cent.
Seasonally adjusted turnover of demand deposits at 343 centers
outside New York declined to 35.2 in December, continuing to move within
the narrow range which has prevailed since spring. Over the year,
turnover averaged 5.2 per cent higher than in 1963, but in the last
quarter of 1964, it averaged only 3.7 per cent above the rate in the
October-December 1963 period.
Seasonally adjusted time and savings deposits at all commercial
banks showed an unusually sharp advance of $1.3 billion in the first half
of January. This followed a record monthly rise of $2 billion in November
and a relatively large increase of $1.4 billion in December. Over the
last quarter of 1964, growth in these deposits was at an annual rate of
16 per cent compared with 11 per cent earlier in the year.
Expansion in savings deposits at weekly reporting banks in
the three weeks ending January 13 was much larger than in the

III -15
corresponding weeks of any other recent year, over twice as much as a
year ago, Growth was up sharply in nearly all Federal Reserve districts
and presumably reflected rate increases following the November revision
of Regulation Q. Expansion in other time deposits, as in early December,
continued larger than a year earlier although in other recent months
it had been smaller. Negotiable CD's at banks in New York and Chicago,
where comparable data are available, increased in similar volume in
the two years. In the week of January 13, when the large city banks were
facing a large volume of mid-month CD maturities, and also were under
unusual reserve pressure from heavy dealer financing and a sharp reduction
in U.S. Government deposits, outstanding CD's at all city banks rose
by a record $500 million,
Bank reserves. Free reserves averaged $90 million over the
three weeks ending January 20, somewhat below the $128 million average in
1/December.- Member bank borrowings at $337 million were above the
December level but about the same as the September-December average.
Excess reserves increased slightly in January to $427 million. Over
the December 31-January 26 period, the effective rate on Federal funds
remainedat 4 per cent through January 18 and then dropped to 3 per cent
on the 19th and 2 per cent on the 20th. Subsequently, it rose to 4
per cent again. Some transactions took place at 4-1/0 per cent on one
day in early January and on several days recently.

INTEPNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
U.S. balance of payments. Fairly complete information now
indicates a balance of payments deficit in 1964 of $3 billion. The upward
revision (from the $2-1/2 billion estimated earlier) stems largely from
the incurrence of a deficit in December instead of the surplus that had
been anticipated. In addition to the failure of Britain to make its usual
year-end payments, the December deficit reflected unexpectedly large out-
flows of U.S. short-term capital.
The revised fourth quarter deficit totals $1.5 billion, or nearly
$1 billion higher after seasonal adjustment than in the third quarter. Of
this seasonally adjusted increase, some $400 million resulted from the
bulge in new Canadian security issues, $140 million from Britain's failure
to make its debt servicing payments, and more than $500 million from in-
creased outflows of long- and short-term loans and other funds reported
by banks. About half of this deficit was financed by unusually large in-
creases in U.S. liquid liabilities to foreign commercial banks and other
private holders, a development which had begun in the third quarter.
Outflows of short-term bank credit and other short-term capital
reported by banks were exceptionally large in December, totaling $500
million (seasonally unadjusted). This is the largest monthly increase so
far recorded in these claims, and compares with outflows of $215 million
in December 1963. Some preliminary information indicates that this out-
flow included a large volume of acceptance credits, some outflows of liquid
funds into U.S. dollar deposits abroad and a substantial outflow of short-
term bank loans, including loans to foreign branches for the presumable

IV -2
purpose of tiding them over year-end pressures in the Euro-dollar market.
A good deal of this outflow may well have been temporary, and support
for this argument might be adduced from the payments surplus indicated
so far in January by fragmentary data, which would be consistent with
the unwinding of such positions. The January surplus might also reflect
receipt by U.S. corporations of dividends that had been deferred until
the farther cut in corporate tax rates became effective at the beginning
of the year.
In November merchandise exports and imports appear again to have
been heavily influenced by the threat of a port strike, There was a
particularly sharp increase in imports. Until labor conditions at ports
are settled and normal work schedules resumed, recent trends in exports
and imports will remain difficult to judge. An interim assessment might
be based on the October-November returns: on a seasonally adjusted basis,
exports in these two months averaged about $25-1/2 billion at an annual
rate and imports averaged about $19-1/2 billion; compared with the third
quarter, these rates represent only a slight improvement for exports and
a rise of almost 3 per cent for imports. The indicated trade surplus,at
a $6 billion rate, was a little less than the 1964 average.
Production developments abroad. In industrial countries abroad,
though levels of activity were well above those of the pending year, 1964
was generally a period of slower growth in industrial output within the
year. Aggregate industrial production in Europe rose 4-5 per cent during
the year as compared to 7 per cent during 1963. Capacity limitations and
labor shortages were a major hindrance to more rapid expansion of economic

IV -3
activity in several countries. In others, restrictive fiscal and monetary
policies adopted to curb inflationary pressures, tended to restrain in-
creases in output. Among the latter, Italy underwent a recession during
a large part of the year though the decline in activity appears to have
bottomed out in the autumn, while in France, as the year went on, increas-
ing signs appeared of a slackening of demand. Outside Europe, industrial
production continued to expand rapidly throughout the year in Japan, while
in Canada, production moved irregularly upward during the year.

Capacity limitations impeded growth of German industrial output
in 1964, perhaps more than in any other European country. In November,
the index of industrial production was 5 per cent higher than in the fourth
quarter of 1963, as compared with a rise of 5-1/2 per cent in the preceding
12-month period; but after the first quarter the rise was only 2 per cent.

IV -4
The slowing of expansion was most marked in the machinery and equipment
sector, where order backogs are very large. Demands for automobiles and
other consumer goods (especially appliances) were strong throughout the
year, and further growth in production of consumer goods may be expected
in 1965 because of additions to consumers' disposable incomes as a result
of the January tax cut.
Output in Italy fell by 6 per cent from the first quarter to the
third quarter. This decline in production was precipitated by the restric-
tive monetary policy and other measures adopted by the Italian government
to correct a serious balance of payments deficit and to reduce consumer
demand at home. Although output declines were widespread throughout in-
dustry, they were especially severe in the cases of investment goods and
automobiles, the latter being most strongly hit by the government's policies
to restrain consumer spending, In the months September-November, the
seasonally adjusted index of industrial production appears to have picked
up a little. Moreover, the most recent monthly business survey showed a
relatively smaller percentage of firms with "low" production than in
earlier months, and order backlogs were not as low as had been reported
in previous surveys.
In France, industrial production rose by only 0.4 per cent
between the second quarter and September-October last year. Consumer
goods and equipment industries have been the weakest areas of production.
In textiles, output fell in that period by 4 per cent; and production
of automobiles in November was reported to be 10 per cent below November
1963. The decline in machinery and equipment production was related to

IV -9
the fact that fixed investment by private industry in 1964 is estimated
to have been about 2 per cent less than in 1963. Even in those industries
in which production had been increasing -- chemicals, petroleum products
and building materials -- signs of weakness have appeared in recent months.
In October and November the British index of industrial production
moved upward by 3 per cent, the first changes in the index since January.
Through September, there had been some falling off in production in the
engineering and allied industries (which account for about half of the
total index of industrial production) and in textiles and paper production.
Canadian industrial production in October was only about 1.5 per
cent higher than in January. The slower rate of growth last year followed
an exceptionally rapid rise in production in the last half of 1963. Out-
put picked up a bit after a pause in the spring but appears to have leveled
out again from August through October. The automobile strike in the U.S.
appears to have affected Canadian production in October. The continuing
strength of new and unfilled orders, together with rising employment,
suggest, however, that output has moved up again since October.
Japanese industrial production last year continued the upward
trend evident since the beginning of 1963. However, because of the
restrictive policies pursued by the Japanese monetary authorities in 1964,
the seasonally adjusted increase in industrial production from January
to November was held down to 10 per cent compared to an increase of 20
per cent for the same period in 1963. Production of capital goods
registered the sharpest advance in 1964, showing an increase of 27 per
cent in October over the level of a year earlier. Consumer goods showed

IV -6
rather divergent trends, with the output of non-durable goods rising 13
per cent against a rise of only 3 per cent for durables.
Other Selected Developments Abroad. Britain's trade deficit
for December, seasonally adjusted, declined to $171 million from the
November deficit of $288 million. A 4 per cent decline in imports
probably included some impact of the import surcharges imposed in October,
but these are likely to have most of their effect in subsequent months.
A 7 per cent increase in exports was reported in December which may
represent the beginning of some renewed expansion of exports.
On January 22, the German Federal Bank raised its discount rate
from 3 per cent to 3.5 per cent, the first change since May 5, 1961 when
the rate was reduced from 3.5 per cent to 3 per cent. The increase in
the German rate followed similar actions taken by eight major countries
during 1964. In past weeks, the German authorities have become increasingly
concerned about the quickening rate of domestic price increases and other
signs of inflationary pressures. The likely immediate impact of the
discount rate action on financial markets, however, is believed to be
small because of the relatively easy money market conditions at this
time of year.

APPENDIX A: STATISTICAL NOTE ON LABOR FORCE STATISTICS
The annual revision of seasonal adjustment factors for the
labor force series has been completed and has resulted in relatively
minor changes in the data. The unemployment rate was revised by 0.1
percentage point in 13 of the months since April 1948; 6 of these
revisions occurred in 1964 including both November and December. The
revised rate for December is 5,0 per cent and for November 4.9 per
cent--a reversal of the unrevised rates. The revision also reduced
somewhat the sharp rise in nonfarm employment earlier this year but
increased the year-end rise. Data for January 1965 will be released
on the revised basis February 4. Complete monthly data for all
seasonally adjusted series will be included in the January 1965 Monthly
Report on the Labor Force to be released February 17.

APPENDIX B: U.S. PRIVATE CAPITAL MOVEMENTS, 1964*
An upsurge in U.S. private capital outflow in the fourth
quarter brought the total for the year to about $6 billion, including
estimates for data still missing. The fourth quarter outflow reflected
a marked increase in long-term capital outflow from the rate for the
first three quarters, and a return of short-term outflows to the very
high rate of the first half of the year. The increased long-term outflow
reflected primarily a jump in U.S. purchases of newly issued foreign
securities from a quarterly average of $160 million in the first three
quarters to about $550 million in the fourth quarter, while the outflow
of long-term bank loans rose further to a level of $300 million for the
quarter, apart from take-overs of Ex-Im Bank loans, up more than 50 per
cent from the first half rate. Direct investment is thought to have
remained high; data are not yet available.
Outstanding short-term claims reported by U.S. banks rose
about $500 million seasonally adjusted, after having changed negligibly
in the third quarter. Details are not available on the composition of
the large December change in bank-reported claims, and there are no data
past October on claims by nonfinancial concerns, who customarily have
reported short-term outflows early in the quarter and reflows in December.
In a longer perspective, comparison of total outflows of U.S.
private capital in 1964, known and estimated, with those of the preceding
two years indicates that a major part of the increase -- from $3.4 billion
and $4.2 billion in 1962 and 1963 respectively -- resulted from higher
recorded short-term outflow. Within this broad category there were
increases in the outflows of both bank credit and corporate liquid funds.
Long-term capital outflows, which had already risen sharply in 1963,
increased somewhat further in 1964.
Short-term Capital. For the first ten months of the year, the
short-term outflow was roughly in line with the peak rates reached in late
1960 and early 1961. The recorded short-term outflow through October was
approximately equally divided between bank loans and acceptance credits,
on the one hand, and deposits and money market investments on the other,
with a smaller part representing commercial credits. As shown in Table 1,
outflow of bank credits was mainly concentrated early in the year, and
in the autumn. The bulge in the first four months reflected large
Japanese borrowing demands (involving substantial amounts of credits
from the Euro-dollar market as well as from U.S. banks) and also more
moderate amounts of credits to Europe and to less developed countries
* Prepared by Robert Gemmill, Special Studies Section.

B- 2
(particularly in Asia). After midyear, borrowing by Latin America
accounted for a major share of the outflow. Much of the second half
outflow to Latin America may be accounted for by the usual seasonal
pattern, but the outflow may also reflect improved U.S. exports to that
area, as appears to have been the case with the more-than-seasonal growth
of credits to Latin America in the first half.
The concentration of the outflow of short-term bank credits to
Japan and to less-developed countries in 1964 represented a continuation
of the pattern of recent years. (In part the credits to Japan reflected
a routing through banks in the United States of Japanese borrowing in
the Euro-dollar market1l/ Short-term credits to Europe (and to Canada)
were not substantial, and the reason appears to be that any European
borrower of sufficient standing to obtain credits from U.S. banks can
also obtain short-term funds through the Euro-dollar market, probably
at lower cost.2/
The large outflows of liquid funds in the first half of 1964
probably included some flows routed to Europe by way of Canada as well
as the amounts shown in Table 2 as having moved directly. Most of the
October outflows to Canada were seasonal movements by nonfinancial
concerns, associated with window-dressing by Canadian banks. Although
no data are available for November and December, the usual seasonal
pattern leads us to expect some considerable reflux of U.S. corporate
liquid funds from Canada in December, and the large decline which
occurred in December in the dollar liabilities to Canada reported by
U.S. agencies of Canadian banks would be consistent with such a reflux.
1/ In the first three quarters of last year, Japanese banks transferred
about $100 million from affiliates in the U.K., France and Germany to
their U.S. agencies, which in turn provided credits to affiliates in
Japan. This particular type of transaction has the effect of "grossing-
up" both U.S. liabilities to foreigners and U.S. claims on foreigners,
compared to the situation in which the European branch advanced the funds
to Tokyo directly, and in assessing the U.S. capital outflow to Japan in
Table 2 one must keep in mind that $100 million of the credits to Japan
represent a flow-through of Euro-dollar funds rather than a direct pro-
vision of U.S. credits. Equally important, if various affiliates of
banks with branches, agencies or head offices in the United States
develop the practice of channeling large amounts of funds through the
United States, the measure of our payments deficit may be adversely
affected by these intra-bank transactions.
2/ At the end of November, outstanding short-term bank credits to Europe
totaled $0.6 billion, and credits to Canada $0.2 billion, out of total
U.S. bank credits to foreigners of $4.9 billion.

B -3
Two-thirds of the outflow of U.S. liquid funds through October
took the form of U.S.-dollar-denominateddeposits in foreign banks, and
after the first quarter there was no net outflow into foreign-currency
money market instruments.
The evidence for the belief that some U.S. funds were trans-
ferred to Europe via the actions of Canadian banks is found in confiden-
tial data on the U.S. dollar position of the latter. These banks
increased their Euro-dollar assets by $250 million in the first three
quarters of last year and also sold some U.S. dollars for Canadian
dollars or other currencies, while making little change in their dollar
assets in the United States. But the entire $250 million cannot be
regarded as "on-lending" of dollars obtained from the United States,
since the Canadian banks also obtained large amounts of U.S. dollars
from Canadian residents.3/
But even allowing for some flow to Europe via Canada, the facts
remain (as may be seen in Table 3) that the short-term flows to Europe
have not accounted for a large part of the total U.S. private short-term
outflow, and that short-term outflows have been a relatively modest part
of total U.S. capital outflows to Europe. Moreover, during 1964 and
especially after midyear, these short-term outflows to Europe were more
than matched by inflows of foreign private funds. These inflows (not
included in Table 3) came in part directly from European nonbanks and
also, on a large scale, through banking channels. American bank branches
in Europe were obtaining U.S. dollars from various sources, and in the
third quarter alone they increased their balances with their U.S. head
offices by $235 million.
Long-term Capital. The largest component of U.S. long-term
capital outflow in 1964, as in earlier years was, direct investment.
This outflow, plus U.S. purchases of foreign stocks (which together
represent the outflows responsive to the factors that influence equity
investments), have accounted for the bulk of total long-term outflows,
and prior to 1963 also accounted for the bulk of the outflows to Europe.4/
While direct investment flows to Europe have continued to rise -- and
these increased particularly sharply in 1964 -- perhaps the most striking
feature of U.S. outflows to Europe beginning 1963 has been step-up of
long-term lending, in particular by banks.
Although the outflow on bank loans had attained a high level
in the second quarter of 1963 -- before proposal of the Interest Equaliza-
tion Tax -- the continuation of the outflow at this rate in the year to
3/ These data are based on an analysis by Mr. Karlik, Balance of Payments
Division of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
4/ Flows to Canada have included large U.S. purchases of new security
issues, and the heavy outflow on new issues in the fourth quarter of last
year primarily reflected Canadian issues.

mid-1964, and the subsequent further increase in long-term lending since
that time, both strongly suggest that European and other demands for
capital that might otherwise have been provided through foreign bond
issues have been met (at least in part) through U.S. bank term loans.
But the over-all expansion of long-term lending shown in the table is
emphasized by the fact that the outflow on long-term loans in the past
two years has much exceeded the levels attained by U.S. acquisitions of
new European securities.
The large supplies of U.S. bank funds for these term loans
reflect the interest of a relatively few large U.S. banks in developing
their foreign term loan business. The special survey of bank lending
to foreigners last spring showed that 90 per cent of the net outflows
on long-term loans in the 9 months ended April 30, 1964 were accounted
for by a dozen banks, and the confidential data on commitments on term
loans (collected under the Interest Equalization Tax law) show no
evidence of a significantly wider dispersion in the past eight months.
Since early 1963 term loans to foreigners (reported by all banks, but
reflecting almost entirely the loans of the large lenders) have accounted
for virtually the entire net increase in total term loans outstanding
(to nonbanks) reported by New York City banks.
The returns on these loans (interest rates generally around
5-1/2 per cent for prime European borrowers and, with a compensating
balance, a gross return of 6 per cent or more) make them attractive
assets to hold against time deposits -- probably more attractive than
prime municipal bonds. Thus, it is not surprising that the recent
confidential commitment data covering the second half of last year
show an acceleration in rate of commitments from that for the first half
of 1964.
