IN BROAD REVIEW
In recent weeks the seriousness of the U.S. balance of payments
problem and the risks involved in the U.S. commitment in Southeast Asia
have become somewhat clearer. Increased recognition of the problems
has contributed to some economic and financial uncertainty but the
positive actions taken to deal with these problems have provided some
reassurance.
In the stock market prices are down somewhat from earlier highs,
a lthough most recently prices have been rising. In markets for fixed
return securities yields have increased generally, but the main impact
has been on short-term yields. Sensitive commodity markets have shown
surprisingly little response to these domestic and foreign developments.
Economic activity has continued to reflect strength of demands.
The degree of strength was still being obscured by the dock strike--
not yet fully settled, the aftermath of the auto strike, and uncertainty
in the steel industry relating to the union election and contract
negotiations and, hence, for inventory accumulation.
The money supply showed little change in early February,
following a relatively slow rate of increase in December and January.
Time and savings deposits rose sharply further in early February, however,
following a record increase in January. Bank credit expansion has
accelerated, reflecting both the large inflow of time and savings
deposits and a record demand for business loans. Free reserves
have been reduced in recent weeks.

I- 2
Among changes shown by nonfinancial indicators, the further
rise in industrial production in January was notable because it occurred
even though auto and steel output showed little change from their capacity-
pressing levels in December. Production schedules for autos call for sus-
tained record rates in February and March. For steel, delays in labor
negotiations will prevent for some time yet any cutback in production for
inventory.
Retail sales in early February appeared to have remained at
their slightly reduced January level. Sales so far this quarter, includ-
ing the sharp rise in auto sales, are consistent with a very substantial
increase in total consumption expenditures and also in total GNP in this
quarter.
Continued strength in final takings, including further growth
in business fixed investment outlays, is also being signalled by new
orders for durable goods. These orders recently have broken out above
the high level prevailing most of last year. Unfilled orders also continue
large. Business inventory accumulation was large in the fourth quarter
and apparently also in the first quarter. Steel and autos, where special
situations prevail,,are currently important parts of the inventory build-up;
elsewhere inventory buying apparently has remained orderly.
The labor market has shown significant signs of strength in recent
months. In January, nonfarm employment rose appreciably further, the work
week was further raised in manufacturing, and the unemployment rate
declined to 4.8 per cent.

I-3
Commodity prices have continued roughly stable so far this
year. While most announced price changes have been on the upside, not
all of these increases have become effective and the industrial price
index is only fractionally higher than a year ago and no higher than
5 years ago.
The U.S. balance of payments deficit in the first month and a
half of 1965 appears to have continued very large, as in the fourth
quarter. This seems to confirm numerous reports of heavy bank lending
in anticipation of application of the IET to banks' term loans. Very
large commitments on term loans were entered into by banks in the
fourth quarter and again in January.
Private buying of gold on the London market has continued
heavy, having been stimulated by the Viet Nam crisis and by President
de Gaulle's remarks on February 4 calling for a return to the gold
standard.
Though U.S. foreign trade statistics for the month of
December showed an unusually large export surplus, the underlying
trend remains obscure because of effects of the anticipated port
strike, which became a reality on January 11. Activity at Atlantic
ports was resumed on February 15.
Prospects for further expansion of U.S. exports in 1965
remain moderately encouraging, in the light of a review of the demand
and production outlook in Europe and Japan.

THE DOMESTIC ECONOMY
Gross national product. A very large increase in gross national
product is indicated for the current quarter. Rebound in auto sales from
reduced fourth quarter levels is contributing heavily to this expansion.
Inventory investment is apparently continuing at around the high
November-December rate which was above the fourth quarter as a whole.
A major uncertainty relates to the effects of the dock strike on net
exports.
Gross national product in the final quarter of 1964 is now
estimated by Commerce Department to have increased $6 billion to an
annual rate of $634.6 billion. This rate vas 5.9 per cent ($35-1/2
billion) higher than a year earlier in current prices and 4.1 per cent
higher in constant prices. For the year as a whole, GNP is now
estimated at $622.6 billion, 6.6 per cent more than in 1963; in
constant prices the gain amounted to 4.8 per cent.
The present estimate for the fourth quarter is $1 billion
higher than the advance Commerce figure, due to higher net exports
which vere at an annual rate of $7.7 billion instead of the $6.5
billion estimated previously. Anticipation of the dock strike was
probably a factor in the rise in net exports from the $7.0 billion
rate in the third quarter.
Inventory accumulation is now estimated at $5.7 billion in
the fourth quarter--double the $2.8 billion rate in the third quarter.
The rise in final purchases was quite small--$3.1 billion--compared
with increases of around $10 billion in each of the first three

II -2
quarters of the year. Consumer expenditures for autos declined nearly
$3 billion and residential construction activity showed a small further
decline. Federal Government purchases of goods and services showed
little change. Increases were somewhat smaller than earlier in the
year for business outlays for fixed capital, consumer spending for
nondurable goods, and State and local government purchases of goods
and services.
Retail sales. In the first half of February, retail
sales appeared to be at about the slightly reduced January level, after
allowance for seasonal influences. Nondurable goods sales, reflecting
gains for most categories, have about returned to the record December
level following a decline in January. On the other hand, sales at
durable goods stores were apparently off slightly further as a result
of declines at lumber, hardware, and furniture and appliance outlets.
Sales of automobiles are still shattering records. In
January they reached a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 9.7 million
domestic vehicles (10.2 million, including imports). The domestic
rate was 8 per cent above December, which also had set a record, and
a fourth higher than the 7.8 million rate of January last year. In
early February, sales continued a fourth higher than a year earlier.
Current extraordinary sales volume is at least partly due to purchases
postponed by the autumn auto strikes.
Dealer stocks of new domestic autos in mid-February were
up appreciably from a month earlier, but were still slightly less than
a year earlier.

II -3
Consumer credit. The pace of expansion in consumer instalment
credit picked up in December and January folloving a decided sloudown
in October and November. The turnaround largely reflected stepped-up
demands for auto credit which accompanied the sharp recovery in sales;
consumers also have been increasing their credit purchases of furniture,
appliances, and other homegoods at a somewhat faster rate than earlier.
By the end of 1964, instalment debt was up more than $5.5
billion from a year earlier, and noninstalment debt was up about $1.3
billion. The quarterly pattern was uneven, however, as may be seen
below.

(Millions of dollars, seasonally adjusted)
Period Amount
1964--Quarter 1 1,531
" 2 1,275
" 3 1,431
S 4 1,271
The first quarter was distinguished by a heavy volume of
auto credit but an even heavier volume, relatively, of non-auto goods
credit. A subsequent slowing in non-auto goods credit expansion was
mainly responsible for the slackened pace in the total in the second
quarter. In the third quarter demand for personal loans was
particularly strong--especially for vacations and educational purposes.
In the final quarter, expansion in auto credit fell far behind the
pace it set earlier in the year despite strong demands for non-auto
goods credit, the rise in the total was the smallest for any quarter
in more than two years.

II -4
Personal income. Personal income in January rose sharply
to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $509-1/2 billion and was $30
billion or 6.3 per cent higher than in January 1964. More than half
of the net rise of $3.7 billion from December was due to the payment,
as in the preceding two years, of all the year's annual dividends on
veterans insurance in January rather than in the actual policy
anniversary months.
Residential building. Seasonally adjusted housing starts
declined to slightly below the 1.5 million rate in January, but
continued above the recent low of August 1964. In contrast, seasonally
adjusted permits turned up in January by more than a tenth and were
nearly at the advanced year-earlier rate. Single-family permits
moved to the highest rate in almost a year. Multi-family permits,
which also showed a striking advance in January, still remained
substantially below their peak at the end of 1963.

Orders for durable goods. New orders for durable goods
increased slightly in January because of higher defense ordering. For
other durable goods, new orders remained close to their record
December level. Unfilled orders showed a small decline in January
but the total was 14 per cent higher than a year earlier and, if
defense orders are excluded, the rise was 21 per cent. The recent
course of new and unfilled orders suggests continued strength in
industrial production in the months immediately ahead.
As a result of the December and January increases, new orders
may have broken out of the pattern which characterized most of 1964.
January 1965 exceeded every month in 1964 except July, when there was
a pronounced peak in defense orders, as shown in the table. In other
months too, gyrations in defense orders had much to do with the ups
and downs of total new orders.

For durable goods excluding defense, new orde'rs showed a
sizable rise last April and then fluctuated within a narrow range
through November. In December and January these orders rose sub-
stantially to a level about 10 per cent above early 1964. Most of the
large increase in new orders for nondefense durables since November
has come from the auto industry, in which November levels weie
depressed by strikes. In this industry, new orders are about equal
to current sales. The electrical machinery group and a collection
of "miscellaneous" durable goods industries have also shown sizable
gains. New orders for nonelectrical machinery rose only slightly from
November to January, and orders for primary metals were about unchanged,
at a level a sixth above early 1964.
Business inventories. With December data now available,
business inventory accumulation for the entire fourth quarter totaled
about $1,450 million and was about double the average rate in the
first three quarters of the year.
In December, book value of all business inventories rose
about $650 million, or .6 per cent, while business sales increased
$2.7 billion, or 4 per cent, from the depressed November level. As
a result, the stock-sales ratio declined to the lowest level yet for
this expansion period.
Manufacturers' inventories increased considerably less in
December than in November and October. Durable goods industries
accounted for three-fourths of the total increase for the quarter
and steel inventory accumulation was the major factor in the expansion,

II -7
Distributors accounted for about $250 million of the accumulation
in December but their stocks were still $300 million below the pre-auto
strike level in September. The rise in distributors' inventories in
December--as in November--was mainly at nondurable retail stores
and at wholesalers of durable goods, including steel. Auto dealer
stocks showed very little recovery in December as record sales absorbed
the bulk of record output.
Industrial production. Industrial production in January
increased further to 137.7 per cent from 137.0 in December and continued
10 points or 8 per cent above a year earlier. Output of steel and
autos was maintained at the very high December levels while production
of nondurable materials and consumer goods other than autos rose.
Business equipment was unchanged in January as a rise in commercial
equipment was about offset by slight declines in industrial and farm
machinery.
The very high rates of output of steel and autos have naturally
attracted the attention of economic analysts. It has therefore been
easy to overlook the continued widespread nature of increases in
output, as is evident in the table. In fact, production of steel
and motor vehicles have shown only moderate increases since last July.
It should be noted, however, that some of the rise in output of
materials has been associated with increased output of steel and
autos.

It may be helpful to put into perspective direct effects of
possible declines in steel and autos on the total index. Auto assemblies
in December and January were at record levels, at seasonally adjusted
annual rates of about 9.5 million units, and production schedules for
February and March are set at the same rate. It is unlikely that the
present pace of output can be sustained. The current high level of
sales is in part a makeup of earlier strike losses and at some point
dealers' stocks will build up to an adequate level. For illustrative
purposes, if auto output should decline from present levels to an 8-1/2
million rate, a decrease of about 10 per cent, this would amount to
a direct loss of 0.4 of a point in the total index.
Production of iron and steel has been at or near record rates
since last July and, beginning in October, inventories of steel have
been rising rather sharply. In December, receipts of steel by manu-
facturers were reported to have been about 10 per cent above their
consumption; it is expected that the rapid rate of inventory accumulation
will continue at least through the first quarter.

II -9
In both 1962 and 1963, following inventory build-up and
subsequent peaceful settlements of labor contracts, steel production
declined 25 per cent in four months. If the contract negotiations,
which are currently postponed due to union election uncertainties,
lead to a peaceful settlement, steel production will likely again be
curtailed. Steel consumption rates are presently above those prevailing
in 1962 and 1963 but steel output is now higher and the period of
accumulation is lasting longer. A decline of 25 per cent in steel
production from current levels, as in 1962 and 1963, would amount
to a direct loss of about 2 points in the total index.
Labor market. Nonfarm payroll employment in January rose
100,000 further to 59.3 million--a level nearly 2 million above a year
earlier. The January increase was smaller than in December partly
because of a decline of 85,000 workers in the transportation industry
resulting from the dock strike. There was little evidence elsewhere
of layoffs attributable to the strike.
Total manufacturing employment in January rose by 80,000
to 17.7 million, the highest level since July 1953, but production
worker employment was still considerably below the 1956-57 levels.
Most of the January increase continued to be concentrated in the durable
sector, reflecting the catch-up in auto production and the steel
build-up. In the nondurable sector, employment increases were small
and centered in the food and apparel industries.
Employment in trade and services increased further, continuing
to account for a sizable share of the rise in total nonfarm employment.

II -10
Government employment remained relatively stable as continued expansion
in State and local governments about offset a drop in Federal employment.
Employment rose slightly faster than the labor force in
January and the unemployment rate declined to 4.8 per cent from 5.0
per cent in December. Although unemployment rates for adult men and
women were little changed over the month, they have declined significantly
over the past year. The rate for teenagers continued at 15 per cent
in January, the same as in most months last year, and almost half
again as high as in August 1957.

The civilian labor force in January was 1.2 million higher
than a year earlier. Total employment rose by 1.7 million with
nonfarm activities up 2 million and farm down 300,000.
Hours and earnings. The average workweek of production
workers in manufacturing rose in January to 41.4 hours, seasonally
adjusted, the longest since Uorld War II. All of the rise was in the
durable sector and most of it was the result of record rates of auto
production. Thus, the workweek in the transportation equipment
industry, which increased 1.3 hours in December, rose again by 1.0
hour to 43.8 hours.

II -11
Average hourly earningsseasonally adjusted, in manufacturing,
edged off 1 cent to $2.56 in January, reflecting relative stability in
both durable and nondurable goods industries. Compared with a year
earlier, these earnings were up 6 cents or 2.4 per cent. Weekly earnings,
however, were up $5.26 or 5.2 per cent from a year earlier, with about
half the rise being due to the longer workweek.
Industrial relations. Uncertainty as to the winner of the
election for the presidency of the steel workers union has continued
to hamper contract bargaining. With control of major offices in doubt,
firm contract decisions by the current officers are unlikely. These
internal difficulties may lead to an extension of the contract beyond
May 1.
Unofficial returns gave the challenger, Mr. Abel, a very
slight lead in the over 600,000 votes cast. Official tabulation of the
vote is expected to be lengthy since a large number of complaints and
challenges by local unions must be investigated before the final
tally can be given to the Executive Board.
Meanwhile, negotiations with the major can companies have
been resumed, but the steel union is expected to ask for an extension
beyond the March 1 deadline. These contracts already have gone well
beyond their original September termination date with both sides
having agreed earlier that the final settlement would be retroactive
to October 1, 1964.

II -12
It is hoped that negotiations with the steel industry vill
get underway next week but serious bargaining is doubtful until the
election of officers is resolved. Union sources have indicated that
an extension of the contract would be acceptable to them in view of
the limited time available for negotiations, but would probably agree
only if the final settlement were made retroactive to May 1. It is not
now known if the steel industry would agree to extension on these terms.
Traditionally, steel management has refused contract extensions providing
for retroactivity. Support for an extension of the contract came from
George Meany, President of the AFL-CIO, this week.
About 85-90 per cent of the striking longshoremen are back
at work. Local disputes continue to tie up ports at Galveston, Houston,
and Miami, but negotiators believe a settlement is imminent. The
strike lasted 33 days before the union issued the back-to-work order
shortly before a Presidential panel reported. It was the first time
the longshoremen's union has varied from its policy of keeping all
workers out until all ports had settled.
The preceding longshoremen's strike--in December 1962 and
January 1963--was in effect about the same length of time, 34 days.
The impact on foreign trade statistics showed up in both the final
quarter 1962 and first quarter of 1963. In the current strike all
ports were closed down 20 days in January and 13 days in February.
Thus, the primary effect will be on the first quarter data, although
the sharp rise in U.S. exports in December may have been partly in
anticipation of a strike.

II -13
Prices. Commodity markets have not reacted strongly to
military developments in the Far East. The standard daily indexes of
spot and future prices have changed little. Copper prices on the
New York and London exchanges have increased appreciably in recent
weeks, after having declined sharply from highs in December, but the
increases do not appear to have been provoked by the international
tensions.
Comprehensive wholesale price statistics for mid-January
show a rise ofl per cent in industrial commodities from mid-December,
and weekly estimates through mid-February show no further change. Thus,
after rising last autumn to a December level .6 above that prevailing
in the first nine months of 1964, the industrial average has increased
only .1 per cent further in the past two months. The mid-February
level is .5 per cent above that of early 1961 and equal to the high
reached in early 1960.
The price index for foodstuffs rose nearly i per cent between
mid-December and mid-January, and it has increased somewhat further
since then. The rise is attributable chiefly to reductions in
marketings of livestock that were in part seasonal. In mid-February,
average prices of foodstuffs were close to the levels for this season
of the past three years. The index for industrial commodities and
foodstuffs combined, at 101.2 per cent of the 1957-59 average in
early February, was up about .5 per cent both from December and
from February 1964.

II -14
Markets for nonferrous metals have been subject to cross-
currents this year; the BLS index of prices, after rising nearly 10
per cent in the second half of 1964, has changed little since December.
World consumption of metals has remained high, and prospects are for a
further increase this year. On the other hand, production of copper
is at a record high and it is likely that inventories are being
rebuilt following the depletion caused by strikes last summer. Further
increases in output of lead and zinc are in prospect for this year.
And proposals to authorize release of metals from the U.S. stockpile
are under consideration in the Congress. Reflecting assessments of the
prospects for improved market supplies, prices for scrap metals have
declined slightly this year.
In mid-February, list prices of aluminum sheets were raised
by what appears to be an average of 1 per cent. These products
account for about 25 per cent of all fabricated aluminum products.
Press reports of the increase noted that actual prices have been
below the published lists, that the price increases announced last
June and November generally did not stick, and that some industry
sources expressed doubt that the increases this time would stick.
No additional changes in steel prices have been reported in
recent weeks. The unsettled issue of union leadership no doubt will
prolong uncertainties about a strike and will cause production to be
maintained for some time at maximum rates, However, the prospects
for eventual sharp decreases in production are already being reflected
in some easing of prices in markets for steel scrap.

II -15
The BLS statistics show that prices of lumber and plywood,
as reported in the press, increased appreciably between mid-December
and mid-January. Production, which had been curtailed by floods in
the Northwest, has recovered more rapidly than anticipated, however,
and prices have now turned down.
In recent months, price averages for most groups of non-
electrical machinery and equipment have increased by one-half to 2
per cent while electrical machinery has declined slightly further.
The whole machinery and equipment group has risen by one-half per
cent, and at 104.3 per cent of the 1957-59 average, it is 1-1/2 per
cent above the level in 1962 and the first half of 1963.
Population. On January 1, 1965 the'U.S. population totaled
193.5 million, 2.65 million more than a year ago. The annual gain was
about the same as in 1963 but much less than in the late 1950's.
Slower population growth in recent years--1.4 per cent in 1964 compared
with 1.8 per cent in 1955--has resulted mainly from a significant
drop in the birth rate. The death rate has tended to show little
change in recent years,

A further decline in the birth rate occurred during 1964; in
the fourth quarter a low of 20.7 per 1,000 was reached. hile it is
thought that the downward trend will soon be reversed because of a
rising number of marriages and a more favorable age distribution, there
is no evidence yet of such a reversal. Many reasons have been
advanced to explain the decline, The number of women in the most
fertile age groups has been declining until recently, the age of
marriage has stopped declining and there has been a slowing in the rise
in the number of children per family. Recent surveys have indicated
that young married couples plan smaller families and are concerned with
costs of raising a family, especially educational expenditures.

Marriages rose again in 1964 and were almost up to the
higher rates of 1954-56. Economic factors were favorable with lower
unemployment rates for men 20-24 years of age an important influence.
Further, the age composition of the population continues to favor a
growing number of marriages. The draft law revision in November 1963
exempting married men, however, caused a temporary bunching of
marriages late in 1963 and in the first half of 1964; by the fourth
quarter of 1964 marriage rates had dropped below those earlier in the
year and in the fourth quarter of 1963.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL SITUATION
Bank credit. In early February, as in January, the rate of
growth of bank credit as well as its composition continued to be
influenced mainly by strong demand for business loans and a large inflow
of time and savings deposits. With expanding time deposits providing
a larger than usual offset to the seasonal decline in demand deposits,
total credit has declined considerably less than usual. After allowance
for seasonal influences, credit growth this year has been somewhat
faster than the average for other recent months.
After declining less than usual in January, total loans rose
more than usual in early February. Banks also added substantially to
their holdings of municipal and agency issues, as they tend to do when
inflows of time and savings deposits are large.
A factor moderating the rate of credit expansion this year
has been a larger than usual decline in holdings of U.S. Government
securities, mainly Treasury bills. This decline appears to have been
largely in response to strong loan demand and the altered structure of
relative costs among alternative reserve-adjustment procedures since
the November increase in the discount rate. Immediately prior to that
increase, the bill yield had been appreciably higher than the discount
rate, and banks added substantially to their bill holdings. Since
then, with bill yields lower than the discount rate and Federal funds
and CD rates as well, banks have reduced their bill holdings.

III -2
As a result of these reductions in short Governments, together
with heavy participation in the January advance refunding, bank liquidity
has declined substantially. On February 10, city bank holdings of
short-term Governments were at about the same level as in early
September, and, except for one week last April, holdings at New York
City banks on February 17 were at the lowest level since the summer
of 1960, amounting to only 3.6 per cent of total deposits.
Business loans, seasonally adjusted, have been expanding at
a record rate so far this year. The January rise of $1.7 billion at
all commercial banks is about twice the previous record monthly increase
which occurred in March 1956 and over three times the average monthly
rise in 1964. In the first two weeks of February, business loans at
city banks rose nearly $500 million, about $3J0 million more than the
largest increase in any other recent year. All major industry
categories except construction and the textiles-apparel groups have
been important contrihutors to the expansion.
This sharp business loan expansion has stemmed mainly from
three unusual and presumably temporary developments, but some step-up
in loan demand probably has also been associated with the accelerated
pace of over-all domestic economic activity. First, the dock strike,
which resulted in tieing up both incoming and outgoing merchandise
shipments, has been mainly responsible for the contra-seasonal rise
in commodity dealer loans, and it may also have contributed to the
stronger loan trend for food processors and possibly trade concerns
as well. Although changes in dealer inventories of new automobiles

III -3
frequently have accounted for unusual fluctuations in trade borrowings
in the past, such changes have not been important recently. Second,
inventory accumulation to hedge against a possible steel strike
probably accounts for most of the contra-seasonal rise in the metals
group since December. The contribution of steel inventory borrowing
to the total business loan rise during this period, however, has been
moderate, probably not exceeding $250 million on a seasonally adjusted
basis. Finally, the pace of foreign business lending rose sharply
in early 1965, presumably in anticipation of possible implementation
of the Gore amendment. Some increase may also have occurred in borrowing
by domestic corporations for use abroad. While figures are not
available on the January increase in business loans attributable to
foreign lending, it is likely that most of the large rise in total
bank loans abroad during that month were in this category.
Money supply and time deposits. The seasonally adjusted money
supply sho-ed little change in the first half of February after
increasing at a relatively slow rate in December and January. Large
transfers of funds into time and savings deposits from other assets,
including demand deposits, continue to dampen the rise in the money
supply. A larger-than-usual rise in U.S. Government deposits also
operated in this direction in the first half of February. Between
October and the first half of February, a period of continuous rapid
growth in time deposits, the money supply increased at an annual rate
of less than 2 per cent.

III -4
Turnover of demand deposits at banks outside New York City
declined substantially in January to 32.1 from 33.6 in December (based
on revised series). The January level is the lowest in over a year and
is slightly below that in January 1964.
Seasonally adjusted time and savings deposits at all commercial
banks increased $1 billion further in the first half of February following
a record $2.4 billion rise over January. The January annual growth
rate of 23 per cent had been exceeded only by that in February 1962,
Since October, growth in time and savings deposits has been at an
annual rate of 20 per cent.
The recent sharp growth in these deposits is attributable to
several factors. Rate increases following the November revision of
Regulation Q have mainly accounted for the surge in savings deposit
inflows so far this year. These deposits at city banks have been
expanding over three times as fast as a year ago and at about the same
pace as in early 1962 following a previous round of rate increases.
Higher rate ceilings also have enabled banks to attract a
large further inflow of other time deposits, but policy decisions by
bank management influenced the behavior of these deposits as well.
For example, the new nonnegotiable savings and investment certificates
that some banks have introduced appear to be attracting substantial
amounts of funds, particularly from small businesses and other
investors having insufficient funds to acquire negotiable CD's.
Outstanding negotiable CD's have also expanded rapidly
further, with the composition of the issuing banks shifting in response

III -5
to changing policies. In January, banks outside New York and Chicago,
where outstandings had shorn little change since last May, accounted
for most of the record increase. At that time, New York City banks
were reported to consider CD funds relatively expensive and only
brought outstandings back to the level prevailing at the time of the
discount rate increase. So far in February, banks in New York City,
which have experienced unusually strong loan demand, have continued to
increase their outstanding CD's, while at outside banks, they have declined.
The further advance in the 90-day Treasury bill yield this year
to a level approaching the 4 per cent ceiling on 30-90 day CD's
undoubtedly has curtailed the available supply of CD funds in this
maturity range, except for the shortest maturities at prime banks.
This may account in part for the renewed expansion in unsecured notes
outstanding. On February 10, these totaled nearly $150 million compared
with about $80 million at the end of the year.
Bank reserves. Free reserves averaged $25 million over the
three weeks ending February 17, considerably below the $120 million
1/average in December and January.- The February average included net
borrowed reserves of $59 million in the week of February 17--the first
week member bank borrowings have exceeded excess reserves on the
initial published estimate since the week ending June 1, 1960. Member
bank borrowings averaged $268 million over the three February weeks,
somewhat above other recent months except for the temporarily high
$417 million level in November. In addition, excess reserves declined
1/ Based on the average of daily figures for all of the reserve weeks

slightly. From January 27 through February 23, the effective rate on
Federal funds rose above 4 per cent on two days in early February and
fell below on one day later in the month. Some transactions took
place above the discount rate on nine days and below it on five days.

III -7
U. S. Government securities market. Yields on U. S. Government
securities have risen since the latter part of January reflecting the
situation in Vietnam, growing expectations of some firming of monetary
policy, and an actual decline of marginal reserve availability. These
conditions have affected mainly the bill and short-term coupon area,
but there has been some associated upward pressure on longer-term rates.
Reaction in the bond market was tempered, however, first by press reports
of the President's opposition to higher bond yields and more recently by
System and Treasury purchases of coupon issues.

Dealers have continued to make good progress in distributing
bonds acquired in the January advance refunding. Even so, their holdings
in mid-February of bonds maturing in more than 20 years remained sub-
stantial, as shown in the table on the next page. Investment demand for
bonds has come from a variety of institutional investors, notably pension
funds, while selling by speculative holders and by some commercial banks
has only partly offset this demand. Nevertheless, yields have been pushed
higher as individual dealers intensified efforts to work down their holdings.

Upward pressure on bill rates has stemmed recently from the
large supply of bills coming into the market. Commercial banks have.
become heavy net sellers of bills in order to finance exceptionally
large loan demands for this time of year, while the Treasury has con-
tinued to add $100 million to each weekly bill auction. The recent ad-
vance in bill rates has been accompanied by a rise in most other short-
term rates, including rates on finance company paper, bankers' accept-
ances, and certificates of deposit, as shown in the following table.
Most short-term rates are currently at their highest levels in about
five years.

Corporate and municipal bond markets. Yields on corporate and
municipal bonds have turned up recently in response to the same expecta-
tional influences that have been at work in the Government securities
market. In addition, the immediate and prospective supplies of new
offerings have expanded somewhat in both markets. The yield series on
new corporate issues--which late last month reached its lowest level in
nearly a year--has since erased about 2/3 of the decline from its sterling
criais high. While yields on high grade municipal bonds continued to decline
through early February to a level only 6 basis points above the six-year
low of November 1962, this downward trend was reversed last week when
yields rose 5 basis points back to their year-end level.

Recent uncertainties about the near-term course of bond yields
have created considerable investor reluctance to buy the four new corporate
bonds marketed competitively since early January. Underwriters had bid
aggressively for these issues apparently in recognition of the unusually
small supply of public offerings that had come to market in recent months.
As sales lagged, syndicates on two of the issues were broken with the
bulk of the securities involved still undistributed. Subsequently their
yields rose 5-14 basis points in secondary market trading. The two issues
remaining in syndicate are still less than half sold. Although the over-
all supply of new corporate debt over the next several months is expected
to be substantially larger than last year, a large part of this increase
will reflect private placements already announced in the financial press.
Also, of the $400 million in public offerings scheduled for March, close
to one-half of the total will consist of convertible issues offered for
stockholder subscription.
In the municipal market, despite the good retail demand for the
recent $100 million State of California bond--much of it nonbank demand
because of the long average term of the issue--retail distribution of a
large number of other recent offerings has been disappointing. This,
together with the continuing substantial supply of new issues, has swelled
dealers' advertised inventories of unsold securities to nearly $750 million,
only $20 million under the record mid-May 1962 level. Since most recent
offerings of large bonds have moved well, dealer inventories consist
mainly of bits and pieces of many offerings rather than large chunks of
a few. With the supply of new issues expected to remain sizable in March,
some further upward pressure on yields may develop.

Common stock prices, as measured by Standard and Poor's composite
index of 500 stocks, are now about 1.1 per cent below the 87.58 record level
reached on February 1. This represents a recovery of approximately one
half of the decline which took place between February 1 and 11, most of
which had been accounted for by sharp drops on several days following
unsettling developments in Vietnam. Trading volume has been large, averaging
about 5.8 million shares a day during the last three weeks.
Total customer credit in the stock market dropped $113 million
further during January to $5.9 billion at the month-end. Most of this
decline was attributable to a $93 million reduction in customers' net
debit balances at brokerage houses. Bank loans to others than brokers
and dealers for purchasing and carrying non-Government securities also
fell $20 million, one of only two months since the November 1963 change
in margin regulations in which such credit has declined.

30-year mortgages sold in the secondary market again averaged 5.45 per
cent, as they have almost without change for nearly two years. Contract
interest rates for conventional first mortgages on homes also continued
unusually stable, at 5.80 per cent for new home loans and 5.85 per cent
for loans on existing houses.
In December, loan-to-price ratios on conventional first mortgages
on homes stayed at or below earlier advanced levels, according to the Home
Loan Bank Board. But prices of new homes purchased by borrowers rose
slightly further and loan amounts generally were higher. Maturities also
continued moderately longer than a year earlier, as shown in the table.

per cent, the average for mortgages delinquent 30 days or more remained
below a year earlier. The rate of mortgages in foreclosure in the fourth
quarter averaged 0.38 per cent, unchanged from the third quarter, though
somewhat higher than a year earlier.
Corporate profits in Manufacturing. Data now available for 600
large companies suggest that total profits of manufacturing corporations
held up surprisingly well in the fourth quarter of last year despite the
sharp drop in earnings of some auto producers. Total manufacturing profits
appear to have shown almost as large a year-to-year gain in the fourth quarter
as in the second and third quarters and, on a seasonally adjusted basis, to
have remained at about their third quarter level.
The 600 companies thus far reporting accounted for over 60 per
cent of after-tax earnings for all manufacturing companies in the fourth
quarter of 1963. However, representation of the various industries is quite
uneven, ranging from less than 30 per cent coverage in foods, textiles and
publishing to 85 per cent or nore in motor vehicles, steel and basic chemicals.
Thus the year-to-year rise of only 9 per cent in aggregate earnings of the
600 companies becomes--when each industry is assigned its usual weight in
the total--a rise of 15 per cent for all manufacturing.
As had been the case through the first three quarters of 1964, a
significant part of the year-to-year rise in fourth quarter after-tax peofits
reflects the cut in Federal income tax rates and the larger benefits from
the investment tax credit which accompanied the sharp rise in capital outlays.
A 15 per cent rise in profits after taxes is estimated to be consistent with
a 10 per cent rise in profits before taxes.

U.S. balance of payments. A continued substantial payments deficit
in January and the first half of February is indicated by available
fragmentary data. The deficit for this period may be estimated roughly
at around $700 million. In early January, there may have been some un-
winding of the large capital outflows that appear to have occurred at the
end of December. But large deficits in the four weeks through February 17
would seem to confirm numerous reports of heavy bank lending to foreigners
prior to the President's Balance of Payments Message on February 10.
Such lending is likely to have consisted heavily of new long-term loans
(including take-downs of earlier commitments) as a result of widespread
anticipation of the extension of the Interest Equalization Tax to these
loans. New commitments on these loans in January were at a rate as high
as, or possibly higher than, in the fourth quarter.
Purchases of new foreign security issues in January and February,
aside from the World Bank issue, were down sharply from the record fourth
quarter rate to a rate close to the $85 million monthly average of such
purchases last year. The nearly $200 million of proceeds from the World
Bank issue issue were invested in time deposits with a maturity of more
than 1-year, which as non-liquid claims are counted as reducing the
over-all payments deficit.
Estimates for the fourth quarter, released by Commerce Department
on February 11, now set the deficit for the quarter at a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of $5.8 billion, slightly less than indicated earlier. The

IV -2
deficit on regular transactions for the year 1964 remains at $3.0 billion.
The latest Commerce data incorporate revisions of seasonal factors for
several capital account items which have the result of altering the
quarterly pattern of the over-all deficit last year. The changes affect
mainly the second and third quarters. The quarterly deficits obtained by
the use of the old and the new seasonals are as follows:

In December, private capital outflows reported by banks totaled
more than $600 million. This brought the total of these outflows for the
year to $2.4 billion and raised the amount of bank-reported claims out-
standing to $11.4 billion at the end of the year, of which it is estimated
that approximately $10 billion represents bank-owned assets. It is the
increase in this last figure that the banks have been asked to limit to 5
per cent in 1965 under the voluntary program to reduce capital outflows.
Short-term claims on foreigners reported by banks rose by nearly
$500 million in December, of which increases in bank loans and acceptance
credits accounted for nearly three-fourths, A $180 million increase in
acceptance credits, mainly to Japan, was about as large as the year

IV -3
before and included a large seasonal element. But in contrast to December
1963, there was also a substantial rise in bank loans to foreign commercial
banks and others. Year-end liquidity needs of European banks and tightness
in the Euro-dollar market may have prompted these loans. The same forces
may also have induced large outflows reported by banks into liquid invest-
ments abroad, mainly to Canada and the U.K. (Data for December on outflows
of liquid funds from U.S. nonfinancial corporations are not yet available.)
Long-term bank claims on foreigners increased by $120 million in
December. One-half of this amount represented further Italian borrowings
and another $45 million the refinancing of an existing Export-Import Bank
loan to Venezuels.
The upsurge in new commitments on long-term bank loans to
foreigners after the middle of last year is shown in the following table
together with data on net disbursements on long-term loans, by quarters:

Out of total commitments entered into during 1964, only about one-sixth
were for the direct purpose of financing U.S. exports. More than one-
third of the commitments were for loans to finance plant expansion and
for working capital purposes. As noted earlier, commitments on long-
term loans in January remained at least as high as the advanced fourth
quarter rate.
Foreign trade data for December are again difficult to interpret
owing to the apparent rescheduling of export and import shipments in
anticipation of the dock strike at East Coast and Gulf ports which
eventually began on January 11. Recorded export shipments rose by more
than 10 per cent in December to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
$29.2 billion (Census basis). (This increase was statistically swollen
to the extent of $80 million -- $1.0 billion annual rate -- by the inclu-
sion of shipments which ordinarily would have appeared in the January
total.) Imports, which had increased sharply in November, fell back
somewhat in December; however, they remained at the advanced annual rate
of $19.7 billion, perhaps still because of accelerated arrivals and
clearance through ports.
For the fourth quarter as a whole, on the balance of payments
basis and after adjustment for the statistical overstatement mentioned
above, exports totaled $26.5 billion at a seasonally adjusted annual
rate and imports totaled $19.6 billion. The resultant trade surplus of
$6.9 billion was $0.4 billion higher than in the third quarter. It is
doubtful, however, that the balance of payments benefitted to the full

IV -5
extent of this increase since the acceleration of shipments was unlikely
to have been accompanied by a fully corresponding acceleration of payments.
The London gold market. Unsettled conditions in Viet Nam and the
continuing French advocacy of a return to the gold standard (see Appendix
B) have produced heavy demands for gold in the London market since
early February. The fixing price has risen to about $35.16 (February 23),
nearly 4 cents higher than at the beginning of the month. This price was
only about 2-1/2 cents below that reached during the 1962 Cuban crisis.
Turnover in the London market has typically been characterized as heavy
or very heavy.

IV- 6
European business developments in 1964 and outlook for 1965.
There was a noticeable quickening in the rate of increase in European
economic activity toward the end of 1964. Follpwing the rapid upswing
during 1963, the rise in output had flattened after the first quarter.
For the year as a whole, real GNP of the European OECD countries was
probably about 5 per cent above the 1963 total.
The pickup in late 1964 was particularly notable in Britain,
Germany, and the Netherlands. Furthermore, Italy's recession seemed
to have been halted. French industrial output, however, was little
if any higher in the fourth quarter than in the spring of 1964.
For 1965, the outlook is for further expansion in both demand
and output of the European OECD countries taken as a whole, Our expec-
tation is that 1965 combined real GNP should be 3 to 3-1/2 per cent
above 1964, about the same as the increase from second half of 1963 to
second half of 1964. The greatest uncertainties arise with respect to
Britain and France. In Britain the impact of recent restrictive measures
was not yet felt at yearend, and additional measures may have to be
taken. In France evidence is accumulating of an easing of expansionary
forces, and even of an incipient downturn.
Factors effecting slowdown during 1964. The failure of British
industrial production to rise from January to September was attributable
in large part to lack of export expansion and to displacement of home
production by rising imports of manufactures. On the Continent, internal
demand leveled off in Italy and increased very little in France. Else-
where, scarcities of labor and other supply limitations were major
factors in the slowdown.

IV- 7
Some restrictive measures were taken by practically all
European countries during the course of the year. Discount rates were
raised in the Netherlands, Sweden, the United Kingdom (each twice); in
Denmark, Switzerland, and Belgium; and--in January 1965--in Germany.
Measures aimed directly at restricting credit expansion were also taken
in most countries. These were particularly effective in Italy and France;
in other countries, except in Sweden, private investment demand continued
to be a major expansionary factor despite credit restraints.
Prices. In 1964, most European countries were less successful
than they had been in 1963 in restraining the trend toward larger price
increases. Wholesale prices rose somewhat faster than in the preceding
year and the pace seems to have speeded up during the second half of the
year. For the first time since 1960, export prices (as measured by
unit-value indexes of export goods) of major European countries began
to rise appreciably after mid-1963, and except in France and Italy this
rise continued throughout 1964.
Foreign trade. Trends in export trade followed much the same
patterns as trends in total output, generally flattening out during the
second and third quarters of 1964, and then turning up again. Intra-
European trade, which had risen sharply during 1963 and into the early
months of 1964, was cut back by both the Italian and French stabili-
zation programs. Offsetting this development, exports to North and
South America, Australia, and the Soviet countries rose throughout
1964. Toward the end of the year, the upturn--or acceleration--was
widespread, affecting intra-European trade and also all segments of

IV -8
Europe's external exports, including those to Asia and Africa. Gains
in Europe's exports to the primary producing countries, somewhat like
the corresponding gains in U.S. exports, reflected with some lag the
big increase in foreign exchange earnings of those countries during
1963 and early 1964,
During 1964, most European countries managed to halt the
deterioration in their trade balances which had been taking place, in
most cases, during the preceding two-and-a-half years. (See the table
on page IV -9.) Even the British trade deficit, though still of
critically large proportions, decreased a little toward yearend.
Although the German trade surplus also increased somewhat in the last
quarter of 1964, German trends generally have been the exception to
the rule since mid-1963; with government policies aimed at decreasing
the embarrassingly large current account surplus that developed in the
second half of 1963, and with business activity rising, German imports
rose strongly during 1964 while exports leveled off, resulting in a
much reduced trade surplus.
The United Kingdom. By mid-1964 it was fairly clear that
earlier prospects for continued growth in U.K. output were not materi-
alizing, despite generally ample plant capacity, Unemployment was
already down to 1.4 per cent, and output appeared to be stable at a
high level. This stability of output is generally attributed to the
failure of exports to expand and to the increase in imports of manu-
factures, which in part displaced home production. The trade deficit
(seasonally adjusted) rose from $171 million (monthly rate) at the

end of 1963 to $278 million in mid-1964. Only private investment grew
at about the rate predicted earlier, and may have compounded the trade
problem by encouraging purchases of capital goods from abroad.
When the Labor Government took over in mid-October, it was
faced with a serious balance of payments problem. Desiring to maintain
economic growth, and having little room to maneuver in shifting resources
because of the tight labor situation, the Government imposed a 15 per
cent surcharge on a wide range of imports; granted certain rebates of
indirect taxes on export sales; raised some indirect taxes; announced
increases in direct taxation and social insurance benefits to become
effective April, 1965, and finally, raised Bank rate to 7 per cent.
Toward the end of the year, there were some signs that
economic activity was expanding again: industrial production began
to rise, after having been stable for about nine months, exports
appeared to be turning up, and imports stopped rising (a development
which seemed rather more an'autonomous one than a response to the 15
per cent import surcharge). However, uncertainties about the general
outlook, prospects of further government restrictive measures, the 7
per cent Bank rate, the net effect of the Government's fiscal measures--
all should have some restraining effect on demand. It therefore is
expected that demand will grow at perhaps a somewhat slower rate than
capacity. For the longer run, the Government appears to be pinning
its hopes on putting into effect an incomes and price stabilization
policy in order to keep British goods competitive and expand exports.

IV -11
France. The French stabilization program, begun in September,
1963, had a strong impact on developments during 1964. In addition,
the expansionary impulses from the external sector diminished during
the year; exports actually declined in the third quarter. A major
factor in this development was the cutback in Italian imports, since
Italy is one of France's major customers. In the fourth quarter, how-
ever, there again appeared to be a revival of exports.
Growth in all major sectors of domestic demand slowed during
the year. The weak demand situation contributed to the flattening of
the trend of industrial output and the appearance of considerable un-
used capacity, which in turn are expected to discourage growth in pri-
vate investment in 1965. Under the Government's policy of price con-
trols, prices of manufactured goods remained relatively stable: in the
fourth quarter, wholesale prices were about 1 per cent above the preced-
ing yearend level and consumer prices were up about 3 per cent. These
advances were much smaller than those in 1963 (5 and 6 per cent, re-
spectively). Greater price stability is thought to have had some effect
on consumers' purchasing behavior and to have played a role in the slow-
down in the growth of consumption expenditures.
Unless the Government acts to stimulate demand, observers are
questioning the feasibility of achieving the officially projected in-
crease of 5 per cent in real GNP from 1964 to 1965. However, the French
authorities are somewhat hesitant about such a shift in policy, because
wages continued to rise substantially during 1964 despite the slowdown
in economic growth.

IV -12
Italy. Italy's economic developments in 1964 were dominated
by the effects of a stringent stabilitzation program. As a result of
the severely restrictive credit policies of the Bank of Italy and
deflationary fiscal measures, there was a distinct slowing down in the
rise of internal demand and output. Industrial production, reflecting
a cutback in inventory investment, fell 5 per cent from the first quarter
to October. Fixed private investment demand fell sharply, private con-
sumption demand expanded much more slowly than in previous years, and
public demand was curtailed. Exports, however, rose by 14 per cent
from late 1963 to late 1964.
Because of the rise in exports and the slowdown in the growth
of internal demand (as well as an inflow of capital), there was a large
improvement in Italy's payments position during the year, which allowed
the authorities to shift their policy goals from deflation to reflation
in late summer.
However, the effects of the new policy trend are not yet dis-
cernible. Although there now is ample credit availability, uncertainties
about the development of demand and reduced profit margins apparently
are impeding the revival of investment demand. Continued price and
wage increases, despite the slack in output, may limit the Government's
possibilities for reflationary measures.
During 1965, the Government has hopes that it may persuade
unions to accept some link between increases in wages and productivity
and work out an effective incomes policy. However, with important
labor contracts expiring this year, the Government may have little

IV -13
time to obtain acceptance of its views; in addition, as long as wages
are tied to the cost-of-living index, an effective incomes policy will
depend on a stabilization of prices that has notl yet been achieved.
Germany. The performance of the German economy in 1964
surpassed earlier growth expectations. At the beginning of the year,
it had been thought that real GNP would rise by about 4.5 per cent
over 1963; by yearend it was clear that the increase had been about 7 per
cent. Furthermore, this faster growth was achieved without the
emergence during the year of acute inflationary pressures, which had
been widely feared by German officials evenat the lower rate of growth.
However, wholesale prices did rise by 2 per cent from mid-year to year-
end.
During the year there was a shift in the demand factors
supporting the business expansion: exports had earlier been the dominant
factor but, after the spring, private investment became the main expan-
sionary factor; then, toward the end of the year, private consumption
demand appeared to move up faster.
For 1965, the labor shortage and the rising degree of capacity
utilization (estimated by an autumn survey as equal to its peak in the
preceding cycle) suggest that output limitations will be a dominant
factor limiting growth.
During 1964, there was a continuing build-up of inflationary
pressures within the German economy, relieved somewhat by rising imports.
With the help of a shift in the external payments balance from surplus
to deficit, the authorities were able to tighten domestic liquidity
considerably by taking a number of moderate monetary measures.

IV -14
For 1965, further intensification of demand pressures is
expected. Consumption demand is likely to be stimulated by the personal
income tax cut (effective on January 1) and export demand appears to be
picking up again. The decision in early January (1965) to raise dis-
count rate was probably intended to serve notice that the German authori-
ties intend to control the emerging inflationary dangers.
Outlook for Japanese GNP and Trade. Growth in Japan's GNP is
likely to be influenced by the relaxation in monetary policy since mid-
December, After the very rapid expansion of output during 1963, which
was accompanied by a sharp increase in imports, monetary policy was
tightened about a year ago. In the course of 1964, the increase in
industrial production slackened, especially after July. Imports,
seasonally adjusted, tended to decline after January 1964 and through
last summer, but moved up sharply in the fourth quarter.
Official economic projections for the fiscal year beginning
this April are now based on expectations of a gradual acceleration in
economic growth during 1965. The published projections and estimates
in the table below relate to the Japanese fiscal year extending from
April through March.

APPENDIX A: RECENT SHIFTS IN COMPOSITION OF NEW CONSTRUCTION*
A feature of the growth in new construction expenditures in the
1960's has been the relatively balanced rate of advance among the major
construction categories. As a result, the importance of private resi-
dential activity in the construction mix has changed only slightly, at
an average of about 40 per cent of the total, as shown in Table 1.
This proportion contrasts with ratios as high as 54 per cent in the
Korean War year of 1950, 47 per cent in the boom year 1955 and 44 per
cent as recently as 1959. Changes in the importance of the private non-
residential and public sectors have also been limited so far in the
1960's. Within residential construction activity, changes have taken
place with respect to the relative importance of single-family and multi-
family housing and among regions and types of financing.

1/ Based on Department of Commerce projections.
This year moderate expansion in residential outlays is expected,
according to Department of Commerce and most other estimates, and resi-
dential construction activity may again account for 40 per cent of the
total. Year-to-year advances in outlays for public and other types of
private construction are also expected to be more moderate than in 1964,

including expenditures for industrial construction, which rose most last
year--13 per cent as compared with 6 per cent for total construction.
And there is a possibility of scattered declines, notably for office and
related construction as well as for farm building and military facilities.
Housing starts. Last year, housing starts totaled 1.5 million,
except for 1963 the highest in nearly a decade. This year, the Department
of Commerce outlook is for no change in total starts, although, as was
the case last year, continued upgrading and some further increase in
building costs are expected to account for an over-all increase in dollar
outlays. Although stability in the annual starts total may be realized
in 1965, there are likely to be further shifts in the composition of
starts as summarized separately in the following sections.
Shifts by type of financing. Government-underwritten mortgages
dwindled further in 1964 as a proportion of total starts, as shown in
Table 2. The decline in their relative share of new starts was much less
marked in 1964 than in other recent years, however, and, for a few months
toward the year end and in January of this year, their share actually
exceeded a year earlier, for the first time since mid-1959.

l/ Preliminary.

A- 3
Thd continued shift away from Government-underwritten mortgages
in financing new housing was associated with the further liberalization
of conventional mortgage terms, particularly for savings and loan associ-
ations since 1961, and with the rapid expansion of new apartment building
in recent years. Apartment construction is usually financed with conven-
tional mortgages to a greater extent than are new single-family houses.
Other factors contributing to the shift from Government-underwritten
financing have included the executive order on open occupancy in Govern-
ment-assisted housing, which became effective in late 1962; more rigorous
screening of marginal borrowers by FPA officers; the improved income and
equity positions of potential home purchasers; and increased reliarce by
some lenders on private types of mortgage insurance.
These and other influences, on balance, probably will not pro-
duce much further change in relative shares of conventional and Govern-
ment-underwritten financing of new starts in 1965. In the case of
VA-guaranteed starts, however, some further decline in importance may
be expected, as the number of persons with rights to VA-guaranteed
mortgages will decline further. VA-guaranteed mortgages have accounted
for less than 5 per cent of total starts in recent years, in contrast
with a high of nearly 25 per cent in 1955.
Regional shifts. Among the geographic shifts that occurred last
year, the decline of one-seventh in the share of total starts from the
West was most striking. While changes in the shares for the South and
Northeast states were nominal, the North Central states registered an
appreciable gain--one tenth. The West's share dropped to less than a
fourth for the first year since 1961. In the fourth quarter alone the
share was actually less than a fifth.
The decline in the West, which involved single as well as
multi-family structures, reflected a number of factors including the
unusual expansion in that region through 1963; lender and builder hesi-
tancy in the face of actual or potential reductions in defense activity;
and an unusually high rate of rental vacancies by the third quarter of
last year. Within the region, the decline appeared to be most marked
in the Los Angeles area.
Shifts by type of structure. In 1964, single-family starts
declined on the average about as much as multi-family starts and the
multi-family share of total starts--37 per cent--changed little after
having risen since 1955. For 1965, some decline from the high 1963-64
avereze multi-family share seems indicated. In the fourth quarter of
1964, multi-family starts were running 16 per cent below a year earlier--
as compared with 4 per cent for single-family starts--and building permits
for multi-family starts were down even more sharply. While an upturn in
multi-family permits occurred this January, the rate remained well under
earlier highs.
The pre-1964 spurt in new apartment starts was to a level more
than double the annual total as recently as 1960. Such an expansion,
by itself, has inevitably involved a reduction in the number of sites

A- 4
most suitable for development and has been associated with further ad-
vances in land and other costs. Also, lender assistance to apartment
builders appears to have become somewhat more selective during the
past year.
Nevertheless most observers do not expect a decline of more
than 50,000 in multi-family starts at the outside limit in 1965 from
the near record 575,000 last year. This is because the decline in
multi-family starts has come at a time when general economic conditions
remain favorable and mortgage money for qualified borrowers continues
ample. Moreover, underlying demographic factors continue to point to
potential further increments in apartment demands over the years ahead.
Taking one example, the number of individuals reaching 18 years of age
this year will rise a million above the average number in this group in
recent years. And, the number of young marrieds and older individuals
usually in the market for apartments meanwhile is still growing. Also,
scrappage of existing structures has apparently continued high or has
been rising. While difficulties have continued to appear in some local-
ities and some regions, vacancy rates in 1964 for the nation as a whole
have also remained below earlier peaks.
In addition, with urbanization continuing at a rapid pace, the
base of multi-family building has broadened significantly further in
terms of types of structures, builders and geographic areas involved. In
some key apartment-building areas, moreover, such as New York--where
earlier changes in zoning regulations induced substantial acceleration
in building schedules through 1963--a shift to more sustainable levels
may already have been accomplished.
So far in the 1960's, annual levels of single-family starts
have changed relatively little at an average of less than 1 million units,
in contrast with earlier peaks of about 1.7 million in 1950, 1.5 million
in 1955, and 1.2 million in 1959. By the fourth quarter of 1964 single-
family starts were still only moderately below a year earlier and building
permits for such structures were holding close to recent highs.
For 1965, upgrading by home owners in a situation of rising
incomes and favorable mortgage terms will continue to act as a factor
sustaining the demand for single-family homes. This may also lead to
a further increase in the value of homes actually purchased. But, as in
other recent years, the level of single-family starts in 1965 will proba-
bly continue to be limited by a lack of growth in the 25-45-year old
segment of the population, which typically forms the major part of the
single-home market.

APPENDIX B: THE GOLD-EXCHANGE STANDARD: BACKGROUND INFORMATION
ON FRENCH VIEWS, 1965 AND 1926-28
During the month of February, the European financial press has
been filled with material related to three major French statements about
the gold-exchange standard and about the U.S. dollar made during the
month. These statements have had the effect of introducing an added
element of uncertainty into the gold and foreign exchange markets. They
have also initiated public discussion of current international financial
policies in the countries of Western Europe which might culminate in
shifts in policies in some European countries with respect to gold and
the dollar.
For these reasons, these three French statements constitute a
dramatic new development in the international financial community during
the past month. Familiarity with the main lines of this discussion be-
comes important background information for interpreting current trends in
international financial thinking, especially in Western European centers.
As a convenience, this material is reproduced in this Appendix. Because
of its importance, the statement of President de Gaulle--toough ambigious
and Delphic in character-is reproduced in full. (Pages B-2 to B-6). The
other two statements-a 1-1/2 hour speech by Finance Minister Giscard
d'Estaing on February 11 and a four-page "Argument With Jacques Rueff" in
the February 13 Economist-are only briefly summarized. (Pages B-6 to
B-8).
It is clear, especially from specific references in the Rueff
interview and from the long historical survey which comprised the early
part of the Giscard d'Estaing speech, that current French thinking is much
influenced not only by post-World War II international payments developments
but by events during the 1920's and 1930's. To throw light upon this basis
of current rench thinking, selected references to French attitudes during
the critical years 1926-28 are reproduced in Part II of this Appendix.
These references, selected from Lester V. Chandlerts biography of
Benjamin Strong, are solely for background information; they are not
intended to suggest any close parallel between conditions in 1926-28 and
in 19659nort' bea reandedanalysis of French thinking in the earlier
period. (Pages B-8 to B-9).
Part I. 1965
A. Statement by President de Gaulle at Press Conference on February 4.
Question: Mr. President, in exchanging a portion of its dollar
holdings for goad, France caused reactions which, in themselves, brought
out certain defects in the present international monetary system. Are you
in favor of reforming this system and, if so, how?
Can you state precisely your policy regarding foreign investments
in France, and particularly American investments?

B -2
Reply: Very well, I shall try to explain my thinking on thispoint,
As the countries of Western Europe that were ruined and deci-
mated by the wars recover their wealth, the relative situation in which
they were placed tends to appear inadequate and often even unrealistic
and dangerous. However, this observation contains nothing which implies
that they, and especially France, are in any way unfriendly toward any
country, and toward America in particular. But the fact that thosecountries desire more and more every day to act on their own in the field
of international relations results from the natural course of events. This
is true of the monetary system that has been in effect, of the monetaryrelations, if you will, that have been in effect in the world since the
ordeals suffered by Europe caused it to lose its balance.
I wish, of course, to speak of the international monetary system,
which came into being right after-the First World War and which was
established following the Second A/orld War7. We know that this system,
after the Genoa Conference in 1922, gave two currencies, the pound and the
dollar, the privilege of being considered the equivalent of gold in foreign
trade. It is true that the pound was devaluated in 1931 and the dollar in
1933 and one might have believed at that time that the privilege, this
signal privilege, this signal advantage of those two currencies was
compromised*
But America recovered from its great depression and then,
afterwards, the Second World War ruined the currencies of Western Europe,
unleashing inflation there. As, after that, nearly all the worldts gold
reserves were then held by the United States and it was the worldts
supplier and consequently it had been able to maintain the value of its
currency, it may have seemed natural for the countries to place, indis-
criminately, either dollars or gold in their foreign exchange reserves and
for the differences in the payments balances to be settled by transferringcredits or American monetary units, as well as precious metal, and,
consequently, this international monetary system, this gold exchange
standard, has been accepted in practice since that time.
But it so happens that it no longer corresponds in the same way
to present-day realities and that, consequently, it has drawbacks which
are becoming more and more serious, As this question--of interest to
everyone-must be considered calmly and objectively, which is made possible
by the fact that the present situation does not appear to contain any very
pressing or alarming elements, this is the time to do so.
Let us note that the conditions that gave rise to the gold
exchange standard have changed very greatly. The currencies of the Western
European States have been restored to such an extent that the total of the
gold reserves held by those States, let us say those six States, the Six,
equals that of the Americans and would even exceed it if those States
decided to convert into gold all their dollar holdings. Hence, the sort of
transcendental value attributed to the dollar has lost its initial basis,
which was the possession by America of most of the worldts gold.

B -3
But, in addition, the fact that many States accept, in principle,
dollars on the same basis as gold in the settlement of differences in their
favor in the American balance of payments, this fact is causing the Americans
to run into debt to foreign countries, at no cost to themselves.
For, what they owe foreign countries, they pay, at least in part,
with dollars that they have only to issue, and not with gold, which has a
real value, which one has only by having earned it, and which cannot be
transferred to others without risks and sacrifices. But also, in so doing,
this sort of unilateral facility that is attributed to the United States
helps imprint the idea that the dollar is an impartial and international
trade medium, whereas it is a credit medium appropriate to one State.
Obviously, there are other consequences of this situation. There
is, in particular, the fact that the United States, not having to pay in
gold, at least not in full, their balance of payments deficits--contrary to
the practice formerly adopted whereby the States f/.e., NationsJ were in-
duced and, if necessary, compelled to adopt the proper measures to bring
their balance of payments into equilibrium-the United States, I repeat, has
deficit balances year after year. Not, to be sure, that all their trade is
unfavorable. Their exports of goods exceed their imports
But this is also true of dollars, whose outflows always exceed
receipts. And so, there is being created in the United States, by means of
what must indeed be called inflation, capital which, in the form of dollar
loans granted to States or private individuals, is exported. And, of course,
this increase in American papei currency renders investments within the
United States less remunerative. Hence, there is a growing tendency in the
United States to invest abroad. The result of this, for certain countries,
is a kind of expropriation of certain of their enterprises.
It is true that this practice has long favored, and continues to
favor, to a certain extent, the manifold and considerqble assistance that
America furnishes to many countries and from which we ourselves, in other
times, greatly benefited. However, circumstances have changed, and that is
why France advocates that the system also be changed, that this kind of
fundamental disequilibrium, which is now a fact, cease. France advocated
this change, as you know, at the Monetary Conference in Tokyo. In view of
the consequences that a crisis occurring in this field would have, we consider
that steps to avert it must be taken in time. We believe that international
trade must be established-as it was before the great world misfortunes-on an
unquestionable monetary basis that does not bear the stamp of any one country
in particular.
On what basis? Indeed, there can really be no other criterion, no
other standard than gold-yes, gold, which never changes, which can be shaped
just as well into ingots, bars, or coins, which has no nationality, and which
has, eternally and universally, been regarded as the unalterable monetary
basis par excellence.
Moreover, regardless of what was imagined or said, or written, or
done during the tremendous ordeals through which we have all lived, the fact
is that even today no currency has any value except by virtue of its relation-
ship, direct or indirect, real or supposed, with gold. Naturally, no State

B -4
can be compelled to do what it should do within its own borders. But ininternational trade the supreme law, the golden rule--there is no mistakeabout it--which must be restored to a place of honor and put back intoforce, is the obligation to bring into equilibrium between one monetaryarea and another, by actual receipts and outflows of the precious metal,the payments balances resulting from their trade.
Of course, the smooth termination of the gold exchange standardand the restoration of the gold standard, as well as the supplementary andtransitional measures that will be essential, particularly the organisingofinternational credit on this new basis-all that must be examined calmly
among the States and particularly among those States which have a special
responsibility because of their economic and financial power.
Moreover the appropriate frameworks for these studies andnegotiations already eist , The International Monetary Fund, which wasinstituted in order to ensure the stability of the currencies--to ensure
it in so far as it is possible to do so-the International Monetary bnd
is certainly a very suitable framework for such negotiations. The Com-
mittee of Ten--which, as you know, is composed, in addition to the United
States and Great Britain, of France, Germany, Italy, Belgium, and the
Netherlands, on the one hand, and of Japan, Sweden, and Canada, on the
other band-Lthe Committee of Ten would prepare the necessary proposals and
then it would devolve upon the Six States--which appear to be in the process
of achieving an Economic Comunity of Western Europe-it would devolve upon
them to work out among themselves, and to win outside acceptance for, the
sound system which would be in conformity with common sense and correspond
to the reviving economic and financial power of our old continent,
France for its part, is ready to contribute actively to thisgreat reform that is essential in the interest of the entire world.
B. Speech by Finance Minister Giscard drEstaing to 2,000 students in the
auditorium at University of Paris Law School on February 11. The
climax of this 1-1/2 hour speech was his announcement of four basis
French proposals:
1. A solemn and unequivocal undertaking on the part of principal
countries henceforth to settle their deficits by direct movementsof gold and no longer by cr ation of additional reserve currencybalances, the amount of which has already been universally judged
adequate.
The speaker went on to mention January 1, 1965 as a starting datebut it was not clear whether he was suggesting that all countries
agree to full gold settlements as from that date or whether he was
simply saying that France would follow this principle.
2. For the financing of "fundamental" balance of payments disequilibria,
use should be made only of forms of assistance provided for by
existing agreements--that is, I.M.F. and the General Arrangements
to Borrow. /That is, no more bilateral assistance, swaps, etc., to
finance "fundamental" disequilibria.e

B -5
3. Reform of the international payments system must be carried out
prior to the creation of "any new resources."
4. Guiding principles for such a reform should be as follows:
a. Internatioial settlements among central banks should be made
only in gold, as General de Gaulle has proposed (See point 1
above).
b. Reserves of central banks of major countries would include
only (i) gold and (ii) "owned reserves linked to gold."_/
Foreign-exchange holdings would be limited to those necessary
to finance normal current transactions,
c. Elimination of excess reserve currency balances should be
effectuated under mutually agreed conditions. Starting
immediately, there would be prohibition on paying any interest
on such balances. At the same time these excess reserve balances
are extinguished, there could be a progressive repayment of
debts which were created as a result of financial assistance,
E.g., Roosa bonds.J_
d. Once this extinction is completed, currencies with international
responsibilities should normally all become convertible into
gold for transactions among central banks, according to
procedures to be worked out.
e. In case of an objectively determined inadequacy in the world's
supply of owned reserves (particularly during the period when
excess reserve currency balances are being reabsorbed), con-
certed mechanisms for the creation of reserves "linked to gold"
could be put into operation on a joint decision of the coun-
tries whose currencies were convertible into gold. f.g. a
"C.R.U." as recommendedby French representatives in international
discusssions.7
He concluded that, until this reform becomes effective, France will follow
these principles in its policies with regard to the international monetary
system,
C. "Argument with Jacques Rueff," The Economist, February 13, 1965, pp. 662-5.
The quotations are of M. Rueff.
a. Defect of gold exchange standard: "The debtor country does not
lose what the creditor country has gained. So the key currency
"Owned reserves" are usually defined as those whose use is at the un-
conditional option of their owner and which are subject to no formal repayment
obligations.

country never feels the effect of a deficit in its balance of
payments. The aim is ...to ensure that the debtor country
loses what the creditor country gains,"
b. The price of gold: "I consider the price of gold as only a side
issue.* * .in 19 'President Roosevelt did not destroy the gold
standard, he restored it ...he definitely restored the gold
standard through an increase in the price of gold. Well, what
will happen if we try to do the same thing today?"
c. Role of gold in adjustment mechanism: "Let me tell you that I
have not at all any religious belief in gold. Gold is not at
all the aim, it is only a means for a certain policy ....
If I want the gold standard it is not because,it will impose on
central banks a certain policy. It is because it will exert its
own influence by the transfer of purchasing power which is the
result of the transfer of gold ....If you want to replace
it by something better, platinam or any other metal ....I
think there are very few people who consider it realistic in the
present condition that gold should be abandoned."
"But surely if any country in the world would have been in the
position to do that it would be the United States. They have
in the public employment more economists ...than any other
country in the world. And they have had for five years an
enormous deficit in the balance of payments. If they have not
done by credit policy what the gold standard would have done by
automatically restricting purchasing power, it is proof that it
is not possible."
d. Experience during the 1920's: "The evolution of the balance
sheets of the central banks is exactly the same, exactly in the
years of t27 and '28 and t29 to what they are now, and it is the
collapse of this system in 1931 which was responsible for the
depth of the depression."
"In 1930, I was responsible for the deposits of the French
Treasury Zn London_7. I had in my hands 10 per cent of the
deposits of the London banks. They were the direct result of
eight years of the gold exchange standard because we had keptthis sterling, as my colleague in New York had kept the dollars,
which had been pouring into the French Treasury from 1927
onwards."
"I would be in full aggreement with you if I could believe ...
that we could maintain indefinitely for instance what we have
done in 1928, 1929, not asking gold in London. But don't you
see in full light that the dollar is very near the limit of its

B -7
payment abroad? Look at the figures. The dollar stock
in the U.S. is diminishing one billion dollars every year
and the claim on gold increasing two billion dollars
every year."
Part II, French Views, 1926-28
In a diary entry of February 6, 1928, Governor Moreau of the Bank
of France spelled out the kind of international payments arrangements which,
in his view, the Bank of England had in mind:
"The currencies will be divided into two classes.
Those of the first class, the dollar and the pound sterling,
based on the pound ad the dollar- with a part of their gold
reserves being held by the Bank of England and the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York. The latter moneys will have lost
their independence. Our political influence in countries
where we have a vital interest will be seriously compro-
mised ..."
'We now have the means of exerting powerful
pressure on the Bank of England." (p. 380.)
Pressure on the pound from France (as described by Professor
Chandler). "London was also under pressure from developments in France.
Stabilized at 3.92 cents, the franc proved to be undervalued in exchange
markets, which helped France realize a strongly favorable balance of trade.
The Bank of France increased its already large holdings of gold and foreign
exchange. Moreau's power over the London market grew ....Norman wanted
the Bank of France to abstain from converting its sterling balances into
gold. This was acceptable to neither Moreau nor his government. After the
stabilization legislation of June, 1928, the Bank of France was not permitted
to purchase foreign exchange, so it had to convert further French gains of
foreign exchange into gold ..."
"In general, this situation persisted until Britain departed from
the gold standard in September, 1931. Norman thought it only reasonable that
the Bank of France should cooperate by continuing to hold large balances in
London rather than converting them into gold. Moreau, wanting a 'real' gold
standard, disagreed .., .He thought the British were trying to reap the
advantage of being an international banking center without meeting the obli-
gations involved in that function." (pp. 378-79.)
The weakness of the British position (as described by Professor
Chandler). "Britain did succeed in achieving a surplus on current inter-
national account during this period. Its receipts for exports of goods and
1/ References in this Part II are to Lester V. Chandler, Benjamin Strong,

B -8
services and its earning on foreign investments exceeded its payments abroad
for imports of goods and services, leaving a surplus for foreign investment,
But its rate of foreign investment tended to exceed its current surplus and
to weaken its balance of payments position."
"In such circumstances the monetary conditions required to equili-
brate Britain's international receipts and ayments were inconsistent with
those necessary to promote prosperity at home. To equilibrate its inter-
national payments and receipts and to retain sufficient gold to ensure the
maintenance of gold payments, it had to keep interest rates in London above
those in New York and other important financial centers ... At the same
time, Britain's international financial position was becoming potentially
dangerous. Its relatively restrictive monetary policy did not prevent its
long-term foreign lending from tending to exceed its net receipts on cur-
rent account. But the high rates in London ...did attract a large
volume of short-term foreign balances subject to withdrawal on demand or
short notice. Norman was tollearn by bitter experience the disadvantages
of relying so heavily on such volatile short-term foreign balances." (p, 331.)
