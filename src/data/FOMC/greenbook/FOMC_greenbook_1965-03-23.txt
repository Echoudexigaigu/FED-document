IN BROAD REVIE
The domestic economy has now entered the fifth year of sus-
tained expansion and there is as yet little indication that the expan-
sion is coming to an end. Despite continuing concern about labor
negotiations and inventory imbalance in steel and related industries,
economic activity has continued to rise and commodity prices have
remained stable.
While activity has been spurred by demands for steel and
autos, both at unsustainably high levels, gains have not been limited
to these industries. The industrial production index rose from 137.5
in December to 138.8 in February without any further increase in com-
bined output of autos and steel from the advanced December level.
Although the rate of unemployment rose slightly in February, signs
of strength in the labor market predominated, including a substantial
increase in the number employed on nonfarm jobs.
Commodity prices have shown little response to the sustained
expansion in demands. The broad industrial average has been stable
this year at a level only 1.2 per cent higher than two years ago.
The rise has been confined mainly to metals and machinery where
demands have been exceptionally strong. An index of all other
industrial prices now is no higher than two years ago and below
the high level reached in the spring of 1959. At retail, prices
of goods continued generally stable in January while prices of
services rose further.
New information of notable importance since the last meet-
ing of the Committee is the announcement of the results of two

I- 2
official surveys conducted in February. A Commerce-SEC survey
reported business plans to spend 12 per cent more on plant and
equipment this year than last. A year ago a rise of 10 per cent
had been signaled for 1964, but, aided, in part, by the large tax
cut stimulus, the actual rise was 14.5 per cent.
The second survey, on manufacturers' inventory and sales
expectations, indicated a sharp decline in the rate of inventory
accumulation in the first and second quarters from the very high
rate in late 1964. A sizable increase was indicated for sales in,
the first quarter and a small decline in the second quarter.
In financial markets, yields on Treasury bills have inched
downward recently despite the tauter reserve position of banks and
the continuing firmness of general money market conditions. For
the last four weeks, banks have shown net borrowed reserves averag-
ing $25 million. In bond markets, there has also been a recent
improvement in tone, with Treasury yields declining slightly and
yields on corporate and municipal issues stabilizing following
substantial increases in February and early March. In general,
bond yields currently are at about the highs reached late last
fall. Stock prices have continued to fluctuate in a narrow range
below earlier highs. Trading has been quite active.
Seasonally adjusted bank credit expanded sharply again
in February, with business loan demand continuing to show excep-
tional strength. Only a part of the rise can be attributed to
special factors such as the surge in foreign lending and increased

I- 3
borrowing associated with the dock strike and steel inventory
accumulation. In New York City, term lending has risen sharply
so far this year, compared with a decline in early 1964.
Time and'savings deposits at commercial banks rose by
a near-record amount in February, but the money supply declined
to the level of last November. In early March, the money supply
apparently was rising again and time and savirgsdeposits expansion
was tapering off.
The initial reactions to the President's balance of pay-
ments program have been favorable. Data on the payments position
show a surplus for the last three weeks in contrast to earlier
large deficits; the Euro dollar market has tightened more than
seasonally; the dollar has strengthened in foreign exchange mar-
kets; and the price of gold in London has fallen sharply.
Abroad, demand pressures on the British economy do not
appear to have slackened since the beginning of the year, despite
a sharp drop in bank advances. However, effects of the 7 per cent
bank rate and of other restraints are undoubtedly working through
the economy. Financial markets are waiting to see what further
reinforcement of restraint policies the April 6 budget will bring.
In France, business activity has slowed. But because
wage rates are continuing to rise, the Finance Minister's opposi-
tion to reflationary measures seems likely to prevail.

THE DOMESTIC ECONOMY
Industrial production. Industrial production in February rose
to 138.8 per cent of the 1957-59 average from 138.1 per cent in January
and remained 8 per cent above a year earlier. Output of consumer goods
increased, despite a small decline in auto assemblies, and production
of business equipment also rose. Materials production continued to
expand although operations in the primary metals industries changed
little at near-capacity rates.
Auto assemblies declined 2 per cent in February from the
record December-January level as severe storms briefly closed many
plants. March production schedules indicate a rise to a new high.
Output of furniture, television sets, and many other consumer goods
rose further in February and over-all output of home goods and apparel
was 8-1/2 per cent above a year earlier.
Production of industrial and commercial equipment increased
in February but output of trucks declined substantially from an extra-
ordinary high in January. Total business equipment production in
January and February was 12 per cent above the year ago level.
Output of iron and steel changed little and was 2 per cent
below the record rate reached just before the 1959 steel strike. In
early March, steel ingot production edged up slightly. Output of
parts for business equipment and consumer durable goods and of chemicals
and textiles rose further in February while output of coal and crude
oil declined. Over-all production of materials was 9 per cent above
a year earlier; output of iron and steel was up 20 per cent and all other
materials were up 8 per cent or about as much as final products.

II -2
Retail sales. Retail sales in February rose 0.6 per cent
from their record January level, according to the Commerce advance report.
January total sales figures have been revised substantially upward to
a rate slightly above the December level. Nondurable goods sales in
February were up 1.5 per cent from their slightly reduced January level,
reflecting widespread gains among most categories. Sales at durable
goods stores, mirroring declines at lumber and hardware and "other
durable goods" outlets, were down 1.2 per cent. Sales at automotive
and furniture and appliance outlets, however, were up slightly.
For January and February combined, total sales were up
almost 5 per cent from their reduced fourth quarter monthly average.
Durable goods were up 12 per cent from the fourth quarter and non-
durables 1 per cent.

In units, deliveries of new domestic automobiles in February
were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 9.6 million vehicles, down
1 per cent from January but a fifth higher than a year earlier. Storms
in the last week of February had no immediate effect on deliveries,
although they may have reduced orders for later delivery. In early
March dealer deliveries declined 1 per cent from a month earlier in
contrast with expectations of a sizable seasonal rise. Deliveries may
have been limited by storms in late February, but a rise of seasonal
proportions this month might not be possible in view of capacity
limitations on production.
Dealers' new car inventories rose seasonally in February and
early March. Iith sales at exceptionally high rates, stocks continued
below a year earlier and in terms of days' supply, below the average
of other recent years.
Consumer credit. Demands for instalment credit have been
strong this year, with much of the strength stemming from the fast
pace of auto sales; activity and credit demands in other consumer
areas also have continued to expand. Final figures for January showed
instalment credit rising at an annual rate of close to $8 billion,
compared with $6.7 billion in December. Early reports for February
suggest a slower pace, more like that in December.
Automobile terms continue on the easy side. The bulk of all
new car contracts continue to be written for a 36-month maximum, while
almost one-third of used car contracts fall in the over 24 months
category. And the latest data show that one-fifth of all new car

II -4
contracts are being written at a figure above 100 per cent of dealer
cost. Three years ago, this proportion was one-sixth.
Delinquency rates on auto contracts, as reported by a sample
of commercial banks to the ABA, have been edging up but only toward
the levels of a year ago. The increase is most apparent in purchased
auto paper. For direct auto loans, delinquency experience has shoun
gradual improvement since early 1961.
Construction activity. Seasonally adjusted new construction
expenditures, which had dipped in January, increased in February to a
new high annual rate of nearly $68 billion. Residential construction
rose further and--including upward revisions in each of the previous
two months--was 6 per cent above its recent low in November and only
4 per cent below the record rate reported in March of last year. Led
by industrial construction, private nonresidential and public activity
also rose in February and were at or near theii recent highs.

Business inventories. Business inventory accumulation in
January was not far below the very high rate in the two preceding
months, as a pronounced step-down in accumulation reported for
manufacturers was in part offset by a step-up in distributors' stocks.
According to preliminary figures, which in recent months have been
subject to large subsequent upward revisions, the January book value
increase totaled $679 million. This compares with a November-December
average of $830 million and with a fourth quarter average of $568 million.
In the first three quarters of 1964, inventory accumulation was at
the rate of only $245 million per month.
Manufacturers' inventory accumulation totaled only $225
million in January as contrasted to around $600 million in November
and in December and $750 million in October. This January slackening
stemmed primarily from a near leveling off in durable goods inventories
after a series of sharp increases.
In view of a continuing high rate of accumulation of steel
inventories the recently reported slow-down is difficult to explain.
The book value of stocks of materials did continue to rise at durable
goods manufacturers, but the rise was only half as large as the
preceding 3-month average. On the other hand, according to a separate
Census report on steel inventories in tonnage terms (and without
seasonal adjustment), accumulation by steel consumers was proceeding
at least as rapidly in January as in the fourth quarter.
Inventories held by nondurable goods manufacturers
increased $167 million in January, about the rate of increase in the

II -6
preceding three months. Increases from October to January followed
nine months of little change, and the rise over the entire twelve-
month period was quite moderate.
Distributors' inventories increased $452 million in January,
and at the end of the month were slightly above the September level.
Auto dealers accounted for half the January rise. Retail stocks of
other durable goods also rose further in January, while nondurable
goods inventories were about unchanged at a level that was low in
relation to sales. Wholesale stocks continued the moderate but steady
rise of otherrecent months.

Plant and equipment expenditure plans. Business spending
for new plant and equipment is expected to increase throughout 1965
and to total $50.2 billion, exceeding capital outlays in 1964 by
$5.3 billion or-12 per cent, according to the latest Commerce-SEC

quarterly survey taken in February, The anticipated increase this year
compares with an actual increase of 14.5 per cent in 1964.

*--Estimated from the February survey totals for the last half of tk
year and the indicated trend for the first two quarters of the year.
Most major industries expect a higher rate of outlays in the
second half of the year than in the first half, but spending plans
suggest outlays in the final quarter of 1965 may be only 7.5 per cent
higher than in the fourth quarter of 1964, as compared with a rise
of 16 per cent from late 1963 to late 1964.
A year ago, the Commerce-SEC survey taken in February
indicated a gain in fixed capital spending for 1964 of 10 per cent
whereas actual spending increased 14.5 per cent. Upward revisions
in plans occurred throughout last year, with the largest revision in
the fourth quarter. Last year's upward adjustment was exceptionally
large and can be explained by special factors, including the reduction
in Federal income taxes.

II -8
Manufacturers' expenditures for new plant and equipment this
year are expected to increase 16 per cent, with advances widespread
among industries. The gain from recent levels to the end of this year,
however, may be no more than half the rise indicated for the year as
a whole. Outlays now planned for the second half of this year by
electrical machinery, motor vehicles, and food and beverage industries
are less than indicated for the first half.
The survey also indicates that manufacturers expect an
increase in sales of 6 per cent in 1965. A year ago manufacturers had
expected a 6 per cent increase in sales for 1964; the actual increase
turned out to be 7 per cent.
A recent survey by the National Industrial Conference Board
of the 1,000 largest companies indicates that new capital appropriations
of manufacturers in the final quarter of 1964 were down 20 per cent
from the third quarter. This decline followed substantial increases
in the two preceding quarters. Significantly, the backlog of unspent
appropriations at the end of the year was as large as at the end of
the third quarter. This survey, according to the Conference Board
interpretation, suggests that the expansion in manufacturers' capital
spending "may tend to slow down a bit toward the end of this year."
Manufacturers' inventory and sales expectations. Manufacturers
now expect their inventories to increase much more slowly in the first
and second quarters of 1965 than in late 1964, According to the
Commerce quarterly survey, conducted in February, manufacturers
anticipate book value increases of only $700 million in the first

quarter and of $900 million in the second quarter, as compared with
actual accumulation totaling $1.9 billion in the fourth quarter. The
shift in pace is expected to come primarily in durable goods industries;
nondurable goods producers look for accumulation to continue near their
moderate fourth quarter rate. The February survey represents the second
reading on first quarter prospects and the change now anticipated is
almost identical with the first "anticipation" obtained in last
November's survey.
Assuming the fourth quarter data are correct, manufacturers
had seriously underestimated their accumulation in the two successive
anticipatory surveys of last August and November. There is thus a
possibility that the first quarter rate is also being underestimated.
An important factor in the high rate of inventory investment in the
fourth quarter was the stepped-up rate of steel stock building at
mills and by steel users; in the first quarter, inventory accumulation
at the steel mills may have tapered off but accumulption by steel
consumers must have continued substantial.
The survey indicated a large rise in manufacturers' sales
expectations from the fourth to the first quarter, but most of this
rise had occurred by December after the auto strikes. Manufacturers'
expectations for the first quarter as a whole can be achieved by only
a small further gain .from the advanced December level. Actual
manufacturers' sales in January were reported slightly below the
record December level.
More interesting is an expected small sales decline in the
second quarter as a result of a 3 per cent decline anticipated by

II -10
durable goods producers as a group. Nondurable goods sales are
expected to continue upward. Cutbacks in auto and steel shipments
from the very high first quarter levels are expected in the second
quarter, according to the survey.
Labor market. Employment in nonfarm establishments continued
to rise in February and the length of the workweek in manufacturing
was maintained at a high level. Employment increased 230,000 last
month; about one-fourth of the rise was due to the return of longshoremen
to work at most ports. "At 59.6 million in February, nonfarm employment
was 1.8 million higher than a year earlier.
The gain in manufacturing employment was somewhat smaller
than in January as transportation equipment and machinery industries
reported smaller increases and primary metals showed little change.
In nondurable goods industries, employment was unchanged; declines
in foods and apparel offset small advances in most other industries,
Durable goods have accounted for 460,000 of the nearly 600,000 rise
in total manufacturing employment over the past year.
The employment gain in nonfarm industries as a whole so
far this year has been about the same as in the comparable period
of 1964, if allowance is made for the dock strike. Construction
employment has increased less but durable goods manufacturing has
increased much more than last year. Other industries have experienced
about the same changes as in early 1964.

1/ Decline in 1965 due to the dock strike.
Unemployment in February was 5 per cent of the civilian
labor force and the rate has shown relatively little change since
July 1964. During this period, employment has increased significantly,
but job gains have been largely matched by growth in the labor force.
A year ago, the unemployment rate was 5.4 per cent.
The teenage unemployment rate declined slightly in February
but it was still not much below the 15 per cent level which has
persisted for more than 2 years. The gain of about 200,000 in teenage
employment over the past year is about as large as the net addition
to the teenage work force. In recent months, fewer young people have
been entering the labor force than expected and their participation
rate has been declining. However, the situation may change in the
spring and summer when youths are expected to enter the labor force

II -12
in exceptionally large numbers. It probably will not be possible
until then to judge the impact on the labor market of the sharply
increased numbers of young people graduating from high school this year.
The jobless rates for adult men and for married men changed
little last month and, at 3.6 and 2.6 respectively, were close to
the low levels of early 1957 when the total unemployment rate was 4
per cent. Long-term unemployment (15 weeks or longer) rose in February
but was 100,000 below a year ago.
Hours and earnings. The average workweek in manufacturing
continued in February at the postwar high level of 41.4 hours. In
durable goods industries as a whole, hours declined somewhat although
they continued to edge up in transportation equipment (to 43.8)
and in primary metals (to 42.5). In nondurable industries, the workweek
reached an average of 40,0 hours at the end of 1964 and has since
increased slightly to 40.2 in February. A level this high has not
been sustained so long since the winter of 1955-56.
Average hourly earnings in manufacturing, seasonally adjusted,
rose 2 cents in February to $2.59 and were 1 cent above the September
1964 high. Hourly earnings were 3.2 per cent higher than in February
a year ago--about in line with the increase in the preceding year.
Average weekly pay has increased 5 per cent reflecting, in addition
to the higher hourly earnings, the rise in overtime hours at premium
pay, principally in the high wage metals industries.
Labor negotiations. Since March 1, over 30,000 members of
the steelworkers union have been on strike against the two major can

II -13
companies. Negotiations are continuing. The general outline of a
settlement which is now developing appears to be for a 3-1/2 year
contract retroactive to last October 1, with a 12 cent an hour, or
nearly 4 per cent money wage increase the first year and a concentration
on fringe benefit improvements in the second year. For the third
year there would be a small wage boost and further fringe improvements.
Major disagreements seem to be over the extent of supplementary
unemployment benefits and pension increases.
A settlement with the can companies is expected to have
considerable influence on steel negotiations. An expanded union
bargaining team, including members of McDonald's opposition, is being
established and it is expected that there is sufficient unity on
the union side to carry on serious talks with the steel companies.
Prices. The industrial commodity price index, according to
weekly estimates, has been stable since mid-January at a level less
than 1 per cent above that prevailing during the first nine months
of 1964. Wholesale prices of foodstuffs have increased slightly from
mid-January, mainly as a consequence of reduced supplies of livestock
and fruits and vegetables. Reflecting the rise in foodstuffs, the
combined wholesale index has edged up further in recent weeks, and at
101.3 per cent of the 1957-59 average, is about 1 per cent higher
than in the first quarter of last year.
In early March, list prices of certain types of tool steels
were increased for the first time sinee 1958. Producers cited rising
costs, particularly for alloying materials. While tool steels are of

II -14
great importance to the machine tool industry, they account for less
than one per cent of the total value of finished steel, Major producers
also posted increases for some grades of electrical sheet and a
reduction in one other grade. Mainly because of the strike possibility,
demand currently is strong enough to support these increases. More
generally, prospects for steel prices still appear to depend on the
outcome of labor contract negotiations--whether or not supplies are
reduced by a strike as well as by the terms of the contract eventually
agreed on.
Meanwhile, steel scrap prices have weakened in recent weeks,
Supplies, from automobile stamping plants, have increased at the same
time that mills have curtailed their buying because of adequate
inventories and the prospects of a decrease in steel production.
Export demands for scrap also are reported to have declined.
Nonferrous metals are still generally in short supply.
However, both the Senate and the House have now passed bills to
authorize sales of copper, lead, and zinc from the stockpile, and
such sales should help to lessen shortages until supplies from com-
mercial sources increase sufficiently. The GSA is prepared to act
promptly upon final passage of the authorizations. Tin continues to
be released by the GSA in quantities such that all reasonable domestic
demands are being met at prices around $1.60 per pound.
Apart from the metal markets, the past several weeks have
been a relatively quiet period for prices. Increases have once again
been announced for a variety of paper and packaging products, and perhaps

II -15
some of the increases will stick this time. Among chemicals, there
have been decreases as well as increases. Fuel oils apparently have
turned down again. A price index of all industrial commodities other
than metals and machinery has been nearly stable over the past 2
years at a level a little more than 1 per cent below the high reached
in the spring of 1959. The combined index for metals and machinery
has risen nearly 3 per cent over the past 2 years; it is 1.3 per cent
above the high reached in 1960, but it is likely that at least some
portion of that rise reflects inadequate allowance in the indexes for
improvement in the quality of machinery.
The consumer price index rose 0.1 per cent in January and
remained 1.1 per cent above a year earlier. While prices of services
continued to rise, prices of foods declined. The average for nonfood
commodities was stable.
Fuels rose further, to about the year-ago level, but apparel
declined by about the usual seasonal amountb New car prices declined,
but by less than the usual seasonal amount because of strong demand
and the lingering effects of the strike last autumn; nevertheless,
retail prices of new cars were slightly lower than a year earlier.
Household durables continued their slow but steady downward trend,
and textile housefurnishings declined.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL SITUATION
U. S. Government securities market. Yields on U. S. Govern-
ment securities have declined from recent peaks reached in late
February or early March. The Treasury bond market has been streng-
thened by a growing conviction that the Administration's current
program to improve the balance of payments will prove effec-
tive, thereby lessening the need for a more restrictive monetary
policy. Meanwhile, the technical position of the long-term market
has improved, as dealers have continued to make progress in reducing
their holdings of Treasury bonds. Small but steady investment demand
for notes and bonds has been reported over the past three weeks, a
period when purchases of coupon issues by the System and the Treasury
trust accounts have been minor in amount. Toward the end of this
period, bond prices were run up further on the appearance of some
demand from dealers and other temporary holders.

A more surprising feature of the government securities market
has been the recent declines in Treasury bill yields. Selling asso-

II -2
ciated with the March dividend and tax dates has been relatively
light, while sizable market demand has been evident from a wide
range of investors, notably public funds but also including banks
and nonfinancial corporations. Market participants have reported
that the demand for bills may have been augmented recently by a
return flow of funds from the Euro dollar and other money markets
abroad, but direct evidence is lacking.
With demand strong, dealer bill positions have tended to
decline, and dealers have had to bid rather aggressively at weekly
auctions to restock inventories. In auctions held March 8 and
March 15, the average issuing rate for the 3-month bill declined to
3.95 per cent and 3.92 per cent respectively.
The downdrift in bill rates has occurred despite continued
pressure on bank reserve positions and a generally taut atmosphere in
the Federal funds market. Reflecting this tautness, dealer financing
costs have remained relatively high at money market banks, but
dealer financing needs have declined along uith their lower positions
in bills and bonds. With a lower need, dealers have not had to rely
heavily on high cost New York City bank financing. At the same time,
a large amount of financing (through repurchase agreements) has been
available from corporations and banks outside New York at relatively
attractive rates, reflecting in part the temporary build-up of
corporate cash prior to the March tax date. Thus, in the recent
period, pressures on central money market banks have not been
transmitted to the bill market.

III -3
Corporate and municipal bond markets. Yields on corporate and
municipal bonds, after advancing by as much as 15 basis points from
late January to early March, have recently stabilized at about the
levels prevailing last fall. An enlarged volume of new issues is
currently meeting favorable reception at these levels. The improved
tone of the market probably reflects both the more realistic pricing
of new issues and some lessening of investor concern that the balance
of payments situation might require further near-term yield adjust-
ments.
Earlier this year, a light calendar had led underwriters to
bid aggressively for publicly offered issues but retail distribution
proved slow, and when syndicates were broken, yields rose sharply.
In contrast the latest offerings have sold out quickly, and some of
the increased investor interest has spilled over to issues remaining
in syndicate. At the same time, the market in early March readily
absorbed the $343 million secondary offering of U.S. Government
holdings of General Aniline and Film Corporation common stock.
In the municipal market, yields on Aaa-rated issues also
have stabilized after rising sharply from mid-February to early
March, At these higher levels, the distribution of new offerings
quickened considerably. While the average yield on seasoned, Aaa-rated
State and local government bonds is the highest since early last
November, it is still 7 basis points below the 1964 high reached in
May. The record $831 million inventory of unsold securities,
advertised by dealers early this month, has declined to about $740

III -4
million as investor reception of new issues has improved and price
cutting on older tax-exempts has resulted in sales from inventory.

While the total volume of new corporate bonds scheduled to
be publicly offered this month is the largest since December 1963,
this should not be overemphasized as a measure of either present or
future corporate financing needs. Public offerings in January and
February were small and, even with the exceptionally large March total,
public offerings for the first quarter will still be below a year ago.
The volume of private placements is expected to continue heavy in the
current month, and during the first quarter directly placed bonds will
exceed those publicly offered by two-thirds. As a result, total
corporate bond offerings in the first quarter of 1965 are likely to
exceed a year earlier by about 10 per cent.
Gross new issues of corporate stock in the first quarter.
also appear to have been somewhat larger than a year earlier, but

III -5
this comparison is misleading as a measure of the change in neC new
equity funds flowing to corporations. First, the statistics on gross
offerings for the first quarter of 1964 include none of the $1.2
billion AT&T issue, though over half of the proceeds were delivered
to the company in March. Second, data on gross offerings are before
allowance for retirements of outstanding stock. Retirements have been un-
usually large this year and, as a result, corporations have obtained
almost no net new funds from equity financing.
In the case of State and local government financing, while
the estimated volume of bond issues for this month is 10 per cent
above that of March 1964, total offerings for the first three months
of 1965 are estimated to be slightly below the first quarter last
year. For the second quarter, the projected volume should be about
the same as the first quarter, after rough allowance for the usual
seasonal change. The timing of new issues over the period is apt to
have considerable influence on market developments.

Stock market. Common stock prices, as measured by Standard
and Poor's index of 500 stocks, have fluctuated within a narrow range
during the past several weeks. Trading has been very active averaging
6.1 million shares daily. At the close Tuesday, the index registered
87.13,-not significantly below the all-time high of 87.58 reached on
February 1. The total amount of customer credit in the stock market
declined slightly further in February to a little less than $6.9
billion, but customers' net debit balances carried with member firms
of the New York Stock Exchange rose by $19 million to slightly more than
$5 billion, reversing an extended downtrend.
Mortgage markets. Mortgage funds have generally remained
ample this year. In February, secondary market yields on FHA-insured,
30-year mortgages again held at 5.45 per cent, as in most of the past
two years. Contract interest rates for conventional first mortgages
on homes also remained at the reduced rates reached in early 1963--
5.80 per cent for new loans and 5.85 per cent for loans on previously
occupied homes according to the Federal Housing Administration.
Indications are, however, that downward pressure on origination fees
and associated charges have persisted this year.
Nonrate terms on conventional first mortgages on existing
property loans generally remained slightly more liberal than a year
earlier. For new home loans, larger average loan amounts were being
allowed on higher priced homes, but loan-to-price ratios and maturities
were the same or somewhat lower than a year earlier.

Bank credit. Seasonally adjusted total credit at all commercial
banks increased substantially further in February. The annual rate of
growth for January and February averaged 11-1/2 per cent, considerably
above the 8 per cent rise in 1964. At city banks, credit growth con-
tinued at a more-than-seasonal pace in the week of March 3, but this
was followed by a contraseasonal decline at New York City banks in
the week of March 10.
The credit rise in February, as in January, reflected a
continued strong loan demand and large inflow of time and savings
deposits, but both have moderated recently. Uhile business loans have
accounted for most of the surge in loan demand, growth in real estate
and consumer loans also has accelerated this year. After showing
little net change since last summer, the loan-deposit ratio rose to
a new postwar high at the end of February.

Holdings of U.S. Government securities declined less than
usual in the second half of February after rapid liquidation earlier in
the year. A large part of the decline has been in Treasury bills which,
together with heavy participation in the January advance refunding, has
reselted in a substantial decline in bank liquidity. Nevertheless, the
ratio of short-term Governments to total deposits at all commercial
banks remains well within the range of fluctuation over the past year.
In late February and early Narch, some city banks added to their bill
holdings, particularly in New York City, where holdings of short
Governments previously had fallen to unusually low levels.
Seasonally adjusted business loans at all commercial banks
increased $1.1 billion in February, more than in any previous month
except for the unusually sharp $1.7 billion rise in January. The
average rate of growth over the two months was almost three times
the monthly average in 1964. Loan demand at city banks continued strong
in the week of March 3, but this was followed by a contraseasonal
decline in outstanding loans at New York City banks in the week of
March 10.
The less rapid expansion since January presumably reflected
in part some tapering off in the pace of lending to foreign businesses
following the President's balance-of-payments message and the launching
of the voluntary credit restraint program. Also, borrowing stemming
from the dock strike has terminated. For example, outstanding loans
to commodity dealers, after rising contraseasonally at a rapid rate
in January and at a reduced rate in February, turned down in March.

III -10
On the other hand, inventory borrowing in anticipation of a possible
steel strike has continued at a moderate pace. Moreover, a strong
undercurrent of loan demand, presumably related to the rapid pace of
domestic economic expansion, has persisted in the trade, public
utilities, petroleum and chemicals and miscellaneous manufacturing
groups.
Term lending at New York City banks has increased sharply
this year, also presumably reflecting the accelerated pace of foreign
lending and increased domestic plant and equipment expenditures.
Through March 10, these loans had increased over $600 million compared
with a $220 million decline in the comparable period last year. As
a result, the ratio of term to total business loans outstanding at
these banks rose substantially after showing only a small net increase
over the preceding two years.
Money supply and time deposits. The seasonally adjusted
money supply declined $700 million in February to a level of $159.1
billion, the same as in November. This decline was associated with
a larger-than-usual build-up in U.S. Government deposits at commercial
banks and with a continued large growth in time and savings deposits.
In the first half of March, however, preliminary data indicate a
substantial money supply increase.
Seasonally adjusted time and savings deposits at all commercial
banks increased $2.2 billion in February following the record rise of
$2.4 billion in January, Over the two months growth was at an annual
rate of almost 22 per cent, close to the highs of early 1962.

III -11
Preliminary data suggest, however, that the rate of growth tapered
off somewhat in the first half of March.
At city banks, the dollar amount of savings deposit growth
so far this year has been about the same as in early 1962, although
the percentage rise has been about one-fourth less. Other time deposits
(IPC) have increased more so far this year than in the comparable
period of any other recent year. A major contributor to this year's
more rapid rise is the large growth in nennegotiable savings and
investment certificates.
Negotiable CD's also are up more this year than in prior
years. But after rising rapidly in January, they rose only moderately
in February and early March. Most of the January growth was at banks
outside New York City, but since then, outstandings at these banks
have shown little net change. In the week of March 10, New York City
banks increased their outstandings by $227 million, presumably in
anticipation of large maturities on the March 15 tax date, which
exceeded $450 million or nearly twice as much as a year earlier.
Negotiable CD's maturing in March, according to the February 17
survey, amounted to nearly 24 per cent of total outstandings on that
date, the highest ratio reported for any tax month thus far.
To obtain new CD funds, some New York City banks raised
their rates on maturities of 6 months or more to 4-3/8 per cent. At
these rates, it is possible that some nonprime banks may again be
encountering difficulties in rolling over their outstandings under
the existing ceiling rates. On March 3, unsecured notes outstanding

III -12
reached a new high of $183 million, an increase of more than $100
million since the beginning of the year.
Bank reserves. Net borrowed reserves averaged $25 million
over the four weeks ending lMarch 10, with borrowings exceeding excess
reserves in three of the four weeks. Borrowings rose to an average of
$380 million between mid-February and mid-lMarch compared with about
$300 million over the previous four weeks. In addition, excess
reserves declined to $360 million from the previous $400 million
average. The effective rate on Federal funds was consistently at
the discount rate between February 10 and Mlarch 15 except for four
days. Some transactions took place at higher than 4 per cent on 16
days and at lover rates on 6 days.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
U.S. balance of payments. The over-all payments position has
shown a marked improvement since the middle of February, according to
the fragmentary information presently available. The large deficit of
the first month and a half of the year has seemingly been replaced, at
least temporarily, by a modest surplus. Despite the recent improvement,
the over-all deficit in January and February totalled over $600 million
(as measured by changes in U.S. monetary reserves, increases in liquid
liabilities to foreigners and estimated advance payments on military
sales).
In part, the improvement of the last few weeks reflected the
intra-quarterly pattern of movements of U.S. corporate funds into
foreign liquid investments early in the quarter and a return flow late
in the quarter to meet the tax date. The behavior of the over-all
deficit indicators taken together with developments in the Euro-dollar
market may mean, however, that this year the shift in these flows was
greater than in the corresponding periods of 1963 and 1964. Another
element in the improvement was a probable cut back, from the reportedly
very heavy rates early in the month, in outflows of long-term bank
loans to developed countries following the imposition of the Interest
Equalization Tax on these loans beginning February 11. No information
is available for this most recent period on short-term bank credit and
other capital outflows, and the possible impact of the balance of
payments program on these flows.

IV -2
Details on bank-reported capital movements in January show
that of net long-term bank loans to foreigners totaling $261 million, the
major portion went to countries outside Europe, and especially to Latin
America. This contrasts with the fourth quarter when about two-thirds of
the net outflow of these loans went to European countries.
The decline in short-term bank-reported claims of $134 million
in January consisted principally of a fall in acceptance credits and some
reflow out of dollar deposits and other liquid investments abroad. The
latter reflow followed the large December outflows into these investments
in response to year-end liquidity demands abroad.
Merchandise exports and imports were cut sharply in January, as
a result of the port strikes beginning in the middle of the month. As
in comparable circumstances two years earlier, exports were reduced by
one-half and by a much larger absolute amount than imports. Imports de-
clined by about one-fourth. The trade figures for February, when they
appear, are not likely to show a big rebound, since most ports did not
reopen until mid-February. Strenuous efforts have reportedly been made
since the end of the strike to clear backlogs of goods at ports but trade
estimates of the time needed to accomplish this have ranged from 6 to
8 weeks.
Euro-dollar and foreign exchange markets. Posted rates for
U.S. dollar deposits in London increased sharply in the first two weeks
of March. Tightness in the Euro-dollar market was particularly acute
around March 8-10, when increases of from 1/4 to nearly 1/2 per cent
occurred for most maturities and when no sellers appeared on one or two
days and only bid quotations were available.

IV -3
As Euro-dollar rates in London moved up, rates for prime
3-month British hire-purchase paper and local authority deposits also
increased sharply from 7-1/2 and 7-1/4 per cent, respectively, on March 1
to 8 and 8-1/8 per cent in the week ending March 12. Movements in Euro-
dollar and other rates are shown in the following table:

The rise in Euro-dollar rates in the first two weeks of March
was partly seasonal. Usually, these rates fall in January after the
period of year-end tightness has passed; in March some recovery in rates
occurs partly because U.S. corporate funds are withdrawn to meet the
mid-March tax date. The rise this year, however, was much sharper than
usual, bringing rates back up to the peak seasonal level of last
December. This may have reflected larger than usual withdrawals of
U.S. corporate funds, possibly in response to the balance of payments
program. In addition, the initial seasonal rise in rates may have helped

IV -4
to trigger some speculative demands for Euro-dollars in anticipation of
large withdrawals of U.S. funds from the market. The absence of sellers
and the availability on one or two days of bid quotations only,may have
been indicative of such a development.
At the end of the second week of March, rates began to ease
off as lenders reappeared in the market.
The rise in Euro-dollar rates has had some repercussions in
foreign exchange markets. Many borrowers in the Euro-dollar market
have apparently been seeking funds elsewhere rather than renew
existing credits at the higher rates. In Britain, Switzerland and the
Netherlands demands for dollars to repay maturing contracts have added
to existing pressures on the exchange rates. In Switzerland, for
example, where a very liquid money market had already produced some
decline in the Swiss franc rate, these added pressures pushed the rate
vis-a-vis the dollar to its lowest point in several years.
Demands for gold in the London gold market reached excep-
tionally heavy proportions in the first week of March. The continuing
debate in Europe about the future of gold and continuing uncertainties
about Viet Nam were among the factors behind a further marked rise in
the gold price. A peak price of $35.178 was reached on Friday,
March 5. Since then, demands have eased off, and the price has fallen
sharply to $35.134 on March 17.

IV -3
Western Europe, The near-term business outlook in several
European countries will be vitally affected by important policy decisions
that governments must now make, In the United Kingdom, the Budget to be
presented on April 6 will indicate how much restraint the Labor Govern-
ment is prepared to impose to strengthen the external position of the
pound, In France, the authorities must make a judgment of whether or
not the current decline in economic activity will develop into a full-
fledged recession if they take no reflationary measures. In Switzerland,
where a surprisingly large popular vote has extended for two years the
Government's powers to continue its anti-inflationary program, the Swiss
authorities now have to decide what part of their restrictive measures
to keep in force. Their problems have been aggravated by the decision--
made for domestic political reasons--to reduce the supply of foreib
labor in Switzerland, despite the prevailing labor scarcity.
United Kingdom. In the United Kingdom, a judgment about how
restrictive the budget for the year beginning April 1 should be depends
chiefly on an assessment of how effective the measures already taken in
the past six months have been, and are going to be, in restraining
aggregate domestic demand this year. In the "little budget" of November 11,
announcement was made of increases in the basic income tax rate and in
social insurance contributions,and unspecified changes in the corporation
and capital gains taxes, all to take effect with the regular April budget.
Since the turn of the year bank credit has been in short supply primarily
because of the heavy first quarter flow of tax funds to the Treasury and
in some measure because of the selective squeeze on bank loans requested
by the Bank of England last December. Bank advances, seasonally adjusted,
fell sharply in January, and continued to fall in February,

IV- 6
Thus far there is little evidence of any slackening of demand
pressures in the economy. Consumer demand appears to be growing steadily;
from late 1963 to late 1964 the real volume of consumption expenditures
rose by 3,3 per cent, slightly more than real disposable income. And
since October retail sales have increased somewhat faster than earlier
in 1964. This year consumer expenditures are expected to continue rising,
in part because the increase in social insurance payments to take effect
in April will tend to increase the spending power of lower income groups.
Data on private investment as yet show no signs of being
affected by recent restrictive measures. Between October 1964 and January
1965 there was little change in investment plans as shown by surveys of
investment intentions undertaken by the Board of Trade Both surveys
suggested a rise of 10 per cent in capital expenditures by manufacturing
industries for 1965 as compared with 1964. However, because of the steep
rise of these expenditures during 1964--a 15 per cent rise was recorded
between the end of 1963 and the end of 1964--the change from the rate
in the fourth quarter 1964 to fourth quarter 1965 would be substantially
less than 10 per cent.
There have been some indications of slackening of inventory
investment, but this may have affected mainly imported materials. The
industrial production index is not available beyond December.
Exports appear to be trending up: the fourth quarter (1964)
showed a good increase from previous months, and February exports (after
a decline in January) were again on the uptrend. Imports, on the other
hand, have been declining since December 1964, in part probably because
of the import surcharge but in February also because of the U.S. dock
strike,

IV -7
Thus, the composite picture in Britain appears to be one of
further expansion of aggregate demand. This has been accompanied by a
rising rate of capacity utilization and a continuing tightening of the
labor market. Accordingly, some observers have been urging the Govern-
ment to put forward a budget restrictive enough to hold down final demand
and to help bring the U.K. balance of payments into equilibrium by 1966.
For example, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research has
estimated that an improvement of about £300 million in the United Kingdom
balance of payments will be required from 1965 to 1966: £100 million
might be obtained by measures to cut overseas Government expenditure
and private investment flows, but £200 million would have to be found
through an adjustment in home demand.
A second school suggests that the tax increases announced in
November 1964, the 7 per cent Bank rate, and the credit squeeze are
likely to have an appreciable effect on output later in the year. These
observers fear that a budget with additional tax increases or heavy cuts
in Government expenditure, coming on top of these earlier measures, would
generate the "stop" phase of another "stop-go" cycle.
Within the Government, opinions are divided. The Minister of
Economic Affairs, George Brown, has gone on record that the restrictive
actions taken or announced so far will provide sufficient domestic
resources for the needed growth in exports (or displacement of imports);
on the other hand, Chancellor of the Exchequer Callaghan is known to
lean more in the direction of some additional restraint on home con-
sumption.

IV -8
France. The de Gaulle Government is being pressed to reverse
its anti-inflationary program. There is definitely a slowdown in business
activity. Private demand slackened during 1964, and industrial output
(seasonally adjusted) in December 1964 was at the same level as in
December 1963, and 2 per cent below September 1964. Private industrial
investment in plant and equipment may have been 5 per cent smaller in
real terms in 1964 than in 1963; it is expected to decline further in
1965, by 2 to 7 per cent.
The latest industry surveys conducted by the Institut National
de la Statistique et des Etudes Economiques in December and January
showed a widespread deterioration in business confidence: increasingly
larger numbers of respondents judged their inventory levels too high,
their order books unsatisfactory, and the expected trend for production
in the next three months as downwards,
Unemployment (after seasonal adjustment) has risen steadily
since mid-1964, and in January was 30 per cent above the preceding
year's level. Job vacancies also declined fairly steadily, and in
January were nearly 50 per cent below their year-earlier level.
Despite the slowdown in business activity, however, hourly wage rates
have continued to rise rapidly, and in the latter part of 1964 were
increasing at an annual rate of about 6 per cent.
Partly because of the continued increase in wage rates,
France's Finance Minister Giscard d'Estaing is strongly opposing any
relaxation of the restrictive policies at this time.
Some measures to stimulate investment are in the offing,
however, according to a speech last week by Prime Minister Pompidou.

IV -9
It is not clear whether these will be long-term measures aimed at
stimulating investment and encouraging business concentration (sought
by the Finance Minister) or whether they will be designed for short-
term expansion. Most observers think that a cut in the corporate tax
will be the most likely measure to be taken. So far, the Government
has continued to hold to its basic goal of price stability, and it has
made only small moves towards relaxing the price freeze instituted in
September 1963; manufacturers may raise the selling prices of some
of their products provided they reduce prices for others.
France's external position has continued to improve in recent
months. In January-February official reserves increased by $155 million,
as compared with a rise of $46 million in the corresponding period of
1964. Exports rose during the latter part of 1964 and this uptrend may
have carried into early 1965. Imports, on the other hand, are no longer
growing as rapidly as in October-November, 1964, if at all. Consequently,
the trade deficit with the non-franc area in January-February was some
30 per cent less than a year earlier.
Switzerland. In last month's referendum, the Swiss Federal
Government received the votes it required to continue in effect for
two years the anti-inflationary measures taken last year under emergency
authorization, which had been due to expire in March.
An unexpectedly large number of voters--60 per cent of the
registered voting population--approved by comfortable majorities the
Government's anti-inflation program. The authorities now have the
option to keep in force the measures designed to keep out foreign funds,

IV -10
to limit credit expansion, and to control the expansion of private and
public construction.
Even after ten months of efforts to restrain inflationary
pressures, however, the pressures remain relatively strong. Investment
in plant and equipment continues at a high rate, partly stimulated by
the increasingly tight labor situation, While direct controls have
cut into building demand since May 1964, pressures on construction
capacity are continuing.
But the authorities' restrictive efforts are beginning to
show some effect: consumer demand is no longer expanding as fast as
in previous months and a downturn in exports has become apparent
recently. In this situation, the authorities have decided to reduce
the number of foreign workers in Switzerland, despite current pressures
on resources. The 770,000 foreign workers constitute approximately
25 per cent of the Swiss labor force. In two executive orders, the
authorities have closed the border to foreign labor entering without
a signed labor contract, and are requiring all Swiss companies to
reduce their foreign work force by 5 per cent by June 30, 1965, and
by another 5 per cent in the following twelve months,

APPENDIX A; PROPOSED MAJOR HOUSING LEGISLATION
The proposed "Housing and Urban Development Act of 1965" was
presented to the Congress on March 4 and will soon be followed by a bill
for a cabinet-level Department of Housing and Urban Development, mentioned
March 2 in the President's message on cities.
The President's message outlined some of the problems associated
with the anticipated growth of urban areas and many of the provisions in
the housing bill intended to alleviate these problems. As in the Housing
Act of 1964, numerous features of the present proposal, if enacted, would
have an impact, albeit often delayed, on new construction, capital
markets, and existing real estate facilities, through the extension,
liberalization, or initiation of a variety of urban and rural programs.
Unlike last year's legislation, there are no provisions this time for
further broad liberalization in the investment powers of either national
banks or savings and loan associations.
For major existing programs, the bill includes authorizations
over a 4-year period totaling: (a) $2.9 billion additional for urban
renewal; (b) $188 million additional in annual grants for the con-
struction of some 140,000 new units of low-rent public housing and for
the purchase or leasing of 100,000 existing dwellings; (c) over $2.3
billion additional for special-assistance purchase by the Federal National
Mortgage Association with Treasury-borrowed funds of certain FHA and VA
mortgages, including proposed FHA-insured land development loans; and
(d) $955 million additional for low-cost college housing loans.
Some major new programs would include: (a) $200 million
yearly by fiscal 1969 for annual grants payable by the Federal Housing
Administration to certain private landlords to subsidize the rents of
qualified lower-income tenants in up to 500,000 new dwellings; (b) FHA
insurance of first mortgages of up to $25 million each to help finance
larger-scale private land development primarily for residential sites,
related uses, or public facilities; and (c) matching grants to certain
public agencies for designated public works, neighborhood facilities,
advance land acquisition, and urban beautification and improvement.
The precise cost of this year's bill is more difficult to
estimate than usual, in part because existing statutory ceilings on
some programs would be eliminated. Through the fiscal year 1969 only,
the bill would provide new obligational authority for major programs of
nearly $3.3 billion in grants and $3.3 billion in loans. Most new
authorizations as well as disbursements would come one or more years
after enactment. Through the fiscal year 1966, for example, the bill
would provide grant authorizations of $772 million and loan authorizations
of $260 million. Full payments, of course, could be delayed for some
time beyond this date, pending the writing of new regulations, develop-
ment of local plans, or Federal approval of local grant or loan
applications.

APPENDIX B: LABOR FORCE PROJECTIONS TO 1960
The Bureau of Labor Statistics recently has issued a new set
of labor force projections which supersede the projections published
in 1962. For 1970, the new projection is 300,000 higher than previ-
ously estimated, mainly because of upward revisions in participation
rates of females. Lower revised population projections, however,
partly offset the upuard revisions in participation rates. The new
estimates call for an 83.3 million civilian labor force in 1970, or
9 million more than in 1964. The average annual growth in the labor
force between 1964 and 1970 is projected at 1.5 million, or 1.8 per
cent, per year, which compares with actual annual increases averaging
less than 1 million since 1960. The faster growth anticipated in the
labor force in part reflects the first influx of postwar babies who
are now reaching working ages.
Employment will thus need to expand by 9 million in the six-
year period just to keep pace with labor force growth and to prevent
unemployment from rising above the 1964 level. To bring the unemploy-
ment rate down to 4 per cent by 1970, employment would have to grow
by 1.6 million per year. By comparison, employment increases since
1960 have averaged about 1 million per year, although in 1964 employ-
ment expanded by 1.5 million.
The output requirements to attain relative full-employment
are quite large. Assuming a continuation of the postwar rate of
increase in productivity, and further assuming that the workweek will
remain relatively stable, BLS estimates that real GNP will have to
expand by 4-3/4 per cent annually in order to employ 96 per cent of
the projected civilian labor force by 1970. A 4-3/4 per cent rate
of increase in real GNP was achieved in 1964 but the postwar average
was 3-1/2 per cent.
The projected composition of the labor force in 1970 suggests
that demands for labor will also have to depart from past trends in
order to minimize unemployment. Nearly half of the anticipated growth
in the labor force will be among young persons age 14 to 24. Provided
enough jobs become available, there may be 1.5 million more teenagers
and 2.75 million more 20-24 year-olds in 1970 than in 1964. The
number of workers under 25 years of age would total over 20 million
in 1970 and would amount to 23.6 per cent of the labor force compared
to 20.7 per cent in 1964. To absorb the rising tide of young males
in the labor force, a continued strong expansion in the goods sector
and in blue-collar occupations, which normally employ a substantial
share of these young workers, would presumably be needed. Official
projections of job opportunities, however, indicate that employment
growth in these areas may continue to expand at a slower than average
rate in the years ahead.

Growth in the labor force of women workers 25 and over is
also expected to be slightly faster than in recent years. This would
presume continued job gains in the service, sales, and clerical occu-
pations where women are traditionally employed. With more women and
youths coming into the labor force, competition for jobs may be more
intense both among youths and older women. Many of these workers
will be seeking part-time employment.
The labor force of men 25 years and over will also rise more
rapidly between 1964 and 1970 than in recent years. Their labor force
is expected to grow by 2 million by 1970, accounting for nearly one-
fourth of the increase in the total labor force. The labor force of
older workers, age 65 and over is expected to grow little as their
participation rate continues its long-term down-trend. The partici-
pation rate of 60-64 year-old men is also expected to decline further
as the result of a sharp increase in early retirement plans and the
lowering of the retirement age in the social security law.
