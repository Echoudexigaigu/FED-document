through a comprehensive digitization proce ss which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain.

IN BROAD REVIEW
Performance of the domestic economy in the first quarter
appears in some respects to have exceeded even the unusually favor-
able earlier expectations. In terms of aggregate demand, a GNP level
of $650 billion seems to have been reached, up about $15 billion from
the fourth quarter. Significantly, the rise in final demands was
especially strong and broadly distributed, while inventory accumula-
tion, judging by January and February data, continued large but not
much higher than in the preceding quarter. The build-up of steel inven-
tores continued, but rates of accumulation apparently have been re-
strained somewhat by the very large final takings of steel products,
including new autos. Unfilled orders for durable goods rose further
in February as new orders continued to exceed sales. Construction
activity continued to edge higher. Industrial production rose further
in March--now tentatively indexed at around 140.
The labor market strengthened materially in the first quar-
ter, with employment registering marked improvement, and unemployment,
both in number and in composition, reflecting more strength than
anticipated. The unemployment rate dropped in March to 4.7 per cent,
the lowest since 1957. Nevertheless, productivity gains have contin-
ued to equal or exceed wage increases, and unit labor costs in manu-
facturing have been essentially stable.
In commodity markets, industrial prices have shown little
change this year, following a rise of 3/4 of 1 per cent last fall.
Among sensitive prices, however, some upward pressures have been in

I-2
evidence recently. Consumer prices were unchanged in February at a
level 1.2 per cent above a year earlier. Stock market prices have
held within a narrow range below their February highs.
Bank credit expanded substantially further in March, with
the increase for the month probably amounting to around $3.5 billion.
For the first quarter as a whole, the annual rate of growth approxi-
mated 13 per cent as compared with 7 per cent in the fourth quarter.
Loan expansion was very large in March with business borrowing heavy
in most categories and especially so for metal and metal-using firms.
The money supply increased $700 million in March. This rise,
however, merely offset a corresponding decline in February and for the
first quarter, the annual rate of growth was only 1 per cent as com-
pared with 3.5 per cent in the preceding quarter. Growth in time and
savingsdeposits slackened markedly in March to about the average monthly
increase in the second half of 1964. For the quarter expansion in the
money supply and time and savings deposits combined was at an annual
rate of 8.8 per cent, about the same as in the fourth quarter. The
increase in public holdings of total liquid assets also was at a rate
about equal to that of late 1964.
Bank reserve availability has come under somewhat more pres-
sure recently and in the two weeks ending April 7 net borrowed re-
serves averaged around $115 million and member bank borrowings from
the Reserve Banks, $540 million.
In corporate, municipal, and U. S. Government security mar-
kets, somewhat greater uncertainty has developed in recent weeks.

I-3
The British budget announcement imparted a somewhat firmer tone to
markets, but a residue of caution apparently remains as investors
await further clarification of sterling's position and attempt to
reappraise prospects for U. S. monetary action. Bond yields gener-
ally have moved up a little but remained below earlier highs for
this year and below the highs reached in the sterling crisis period
in late 1964. The yield on the 3-month Treasury bill increased
somewhat in late March and early April to 3.94 per cent.
The balance of payments showed a substantial but partly
seasonal surplus in March according to very preliminary indications.
The result was a first-quarter deficit at a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of roughly $2-1/2 billion. The March surplus may have
reflected a bigger than usual reflux of U. S. corporate funds, and
perhaps also a catching up of exports in the wake of the port strike.
The March surplus was reflected in a decline in balances held here
by commercial banks located abroad, rather than in net official
settlements.
In Europe, financial policies have remained generally re-
strictive, except in Italy where fiscal policy measures were announced
in March to supplement last summer's easing of credit policy. A
marked turn toward easier monetary policy took place in Japan at
the beginning of April.

THE DOMESTIC ECONOMY
Industrial production. Industrial production in March is
estimated to have risen further to about 140 per cent of the 1957-59
average--at least one point above the preliminary February index of
138.8. The indicated gains in production appear to have been wide-
spread, judging by incomplete data. The indexes of final products and
materials both apparently showed further increases.
In March, as in February, industrial production was 8 per cent
above a year earlier with the rise in the total index in the six months
ending February not so large as in the preceding six months. However,
excluding steel and autos, growth was about the same in the two periods.
An increase in output of household durable goods as rapid as 8 per cent,
shown below for the latest six-month period, often occurs in recovery
from recession but is unusual after a long period of expansion.

Among final products, auto assemblies in March were at a
record seasonally adjusted annual rate of 9.9 million units compared
with 9.1 million in February. Output in the first seven months of the
1965 model year, including the two strike months, was at an annual
rate of 8.1 million units as compared with 7.9 million during the
comparable 1964 model year period--up 3 per cent. Production schedules
for the second quarter of this year are set at about a 9.5 million
rate--the same as in the first quarter. The March rise in auto output
along with a rebound in truck production and an estimated increase in
output of automotive parts is equivalent to a rise of close to half
a point in the total index.
Available weekly data on output of television sets indicate
a further increase in March. Output of color television sets has been
increasing rapidly and currently is about 35 per cent greater than
that of black and white console sets and is 20 per cent of total
television production.
Further increases in output of business equipment and some
other metal products are indicated by the preliminary information on
March manhours of work.
Among materials, output of steel ingots increased slightly
further and production of crude oil, refined oil products, and paper-
board continued at advanced levels. Some further increases in other
materials-producing industries, including paper and chemicals, also
may have occurred.

II -3
Retail sales. Retail sales in March (based on four full
weeks) appear to have declined moderately from their advanced February
level, after allowances for the usual seasonal influences and the
changing date of Easter. Owing to less than seasonal increases at
automotive and furniture and appliance outlets, sales at durable goods
stores appear to have declined appreciably from their February high.
Sales at nondurable goods outlets, which also reached a new high in
February, may have declined fractionally.
Total retail sales in the first quarter sparked by large
increases at automotive outlets, appear to have advanced 4.5 per cent
from the reduced fourth quarter, about 3.5 per cent from the preceding
high reached in the third quarter 1964, and 8 per cent from the first
quarter of last year.
The current figures for January and February are considerably
higher than those first reported. The advance February total has
been revised upward almost 2 per cent, reflecting significant upward
revisions for both durable and nondurable goods. A month ago the
advance January figures were also revised upward about 2 per cent,
Autos. Sales of new domestic autos, already at a very high
rate in February, rose further in March, setting a monthly record of
30,000 units per trading day. Dealers, moreover, reported that sales
were limited by supply bottlenecks for the newly popular sports and
luxury models. Total inventories of new cars increased further but
were still low relative to sales. Strong as the market for cars was,
sales showed less than usual large seasonal rise in March and seasonally

II -4
adjusted rates declined 8 per cent to an annual rate of 8.8 million.
This may be compared with the 7.7 million new domestic cars sold during
the 1964 model year.
Consumer credit. Credit buying continued at a fast pace in
February, reflecting in part unusually strong demands for autos,
color television sets, and selected appliances. Instalment credit
rose $641 million after seasonal adjustment, second only to the $670
million rise reported for January. The pace apparently slowed a little
in March, but in dollar amount the expansion indicated for the first
quarter should establish a record. In percentage terms, however, the
first quarter is expected to rank well behind gains in the peak
quarters of 1955 and 1959.
The recent rise in instalment debt has been distinguished
by very sizable increases in the auto component, which averaged more
than $300 million a month in January and February as compared with
$170 million a month in the second half of 1964.
At least part of the rise in auto debt (and for that matter,
total instalment debt) in January was due to a temporary dip in repayments.
The upward trend was resumed in February with seasonally adjusted
repayments up $168 million.
Construction activity. Seasonally adjusted new construction
expenditures edged up further in March to a new high. Residential
activity declined through most of last year but has tended upward in
recent months and rose again in March. Most other types of private
and public activity also advanced last month, with expansion in
industrial construction expenditures continuing marked.

II -5
In the first quarter as a whole, construction activity
reached an annual rate of $67.2 billion, up 1 per cent from the previous
peak in the third quarter of last year.
Business inventories. The seasonally adjusted book value of
business inventories increased only $325 million in February, according
to preliminary figures. But, following the experience of other recent
months, the preliminary January figures have been revised substantially
upward. The increase for January is now estimated to total almost
$1 billion, as compared with less than $700 million reported a month
ago. Thus, accumulation now shown for the first two months of the
quarter totaled $1.3 billion, or an annual rate of $7.8 billion. The
November-December rate was $10 billion.
Inventory holding of manufacturers increased only $135
million in February, This was the smallest increase since last July.
With an increase of $400 million now reported for the first two months
of the year, accumulation by manufacturers in the first quarter may
turn out to be close to the $700 million indicated by the February
quarterly survey of manufacturers' expectations. The actual increase
in the fourth quarter was $1.9 billion.
The February increase in factory stocks was concentrated in
durable goods. At steel mills, inventories declined somewhat following
a sharp run-up in the fourth quarter, while outside of the steel
industry accumulation of steel continued at about the rapid pace of
other recent months.

II -6
Three-fifths of the February increase in total business
inventories, and an even larger proportion of the January increase,
occurred at distributors. (The bulk of the upward revision in January
was at distributors.) This is in marked contrast with the fourth
quarter when manufacturers accounted for the entire rise and distributors'
inventories declined somewhat. For January-February combined,
distributors' inventories increased $900 million while manufacturers'
stocks rose only less than half that amount.
On the basis of these new figures, stocks of wholesalers
have shown a sharp spurt, rising nearly $400 million in the first two
months of the year. Retail stocks rose about $500 million over the
recent two-month period, and virtually all the rise was at durable
goods stores, with nearly two-thirds of that increase at auto dealers.
Labor market. Widespread improvement in the labor market
continued in March. The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate declined
to 4.7 per cent from 5 per cent in February, the lowest monthly rate
in more than seven years. The unemployment rate averaged 4.8 per cent
for the first quarter, down from 5 per cent in the fourth quarter.
This was the fifth consecutive quarter to show a decline.
Nearly all of the March decline in unemployment was among
adult men and women, with employment unchanged whilA the adult labor
force declined. Teenagers experienced a rise in employment but their
labor force also increased and there was little significant change in
their unemployment rate. Long-term unemployment (15 weeks or more)
declined significantly further in March to a level 300,000 below

II -7
a year earlier and was the lowest for the month in eight years.
Moreover, the decline was greater for the very long-term unemployed
(27 weeks or more) than for those out of work for shorter periods.
The labor force in March was only 1.1 million larger than
a year earlier; this was less than the projected increase. Total
employment (household data) was more than 1.6 million higher and the
number unemployed was about one-half million less than a year earlier.
More than half the decline in unemployment over the past year
occurred among adult men. The jobless rate for this group was 3.3
per cent in March, compared to 4.0 per cent a year earlier. The rate
for adult women was one percentage point below a year earlier and,
except for January, the lowest in five years. The teenage unemployment
rate showed little significant change over the year.
Steel negotiations. The steel workers presented their economic
demands to the steel industry at the end of March leaving only one
month for negotiating a contract before strike deadline. The list of
demands, as expected, is extensive and the cost is higher than the
3-1/2 per cent package increase negotiated in the can company settle-
ment. The demands include 25 cents--in two annual increases of 12-1/2
cents--in basic wage rates. For nonincentive employees a 10 per cent
increase is called for over a 3-year period. In addition, the union
is asking the steel companies for increases in premiums for overtime,
holidays, and night-shift work; a cost-of-living escalator clause is
also included in the package, but this demand was dropped in the can

II -8
company negotiations. A supplemental monthly payment of $100 for
early retirement is the same as in the can contracts, but substantially
less than received in autos. The steel union is placing greater emphasis
on higher regular pension payment than on earlier retirement. The
demand for an increase in the duration of supplementary unemployment
benefits is not yet specific, although the demand for an increase in
the percentage of normal pay covered by the benefits is less than in
the can contract.
Prices. While the industrial commodity price index has
continued stable this year following its rise of three-fourths of a
per cent last autumn, prices of some sensitive commodities have resumed
their advance and there have been increases reported for some other
industrial products. The current index level is equal to the peak
reached about 5 years ago.
Wholesale prices of foodstuffs have increased this year
reflecting mainly a greater-than-seasonal decrease in marketings of
hogs--as a result of relatively low prices last year--and sustained
expansion in demand for meats. Prices of foodstuffs remain within
their range of fluctuation through the past five years, and they are
more than 5 per cent below the level reached in early 1958 when
livestock marketings fell to one of their cyclical lows.
While the over-all industrial index has been stable, the
daily index for 13 raw industrial commodities has regained its high
of last autumn. Prices of copper (in the 'free' markets), tin, and

11 -9
rubber have increased appreciably. The increases may reflect primarily
speculative reactions to events in Vietnam and Indonesia and to
renewed attacks on sterling. All the hard news, as one journal put
it, has been bearish: legislation has been enacted to release
substantial amounts of copper, lead, and zinc from the stockpile;
the strike against copper facilities in Zambia has ended; and the
strike in Australia appears close to a settlement. Most recently,
copper strikes have threatened again in South America. Domestic users
of tin continue to be adequately supplied by releases from the stock-
pile.
Producers of aluminum sheet for use in cans have announced
price increases of up to 3 per cent, and can companies announced
that prices will be raised following negotiation of a new labor
contract estimated to increase hourly labor costs at an annual rate
of 3-1/2 per cent. Earlier, price increases had been announced for
some glass and paper containers. Packaging markets, nevertheless,
continue to be characterized by innovations and intense competition.
The consumer price index was unchanged in February. Foods
were stable while nonfood commodities declined and services continued
their steady upward trend. New car prices declined about seasonally
and used car prices also went down. Increases in prices were noted
for such items as property taxes, holme and auto insurance premiums,
auto repairs, local transit fares, and medical care services.

Agriculture. The March survey of farmers' planting plans
for 1965 indicates that the total acreage will be only a little larger
than the 306 million acres planted last year but that there will be
substantial shifts among crops. Expanded acreages are planned for
soybeans, grain sorghums, hay, potatoes, and dry beans and reduced
plantings for oats, barley, corn, cotton, tobacco, spring wheat,
and sugar beets.
The Crop Reporting Board estimates that the 1 per cent
smaller acreage of corn, the major feed grain, may produce a crop
equal to the record of 1963. Such a crop combined with the planned
increase in grain sorghum acreage would result in a build-up in
feed grain stocks, reversing the downtrend of the past two seasons.
A 1.3 billion bushel wheat crop is now in prospect, 1 per cent
above last year's outturn. Cotton acreage is expected to be down
4 per cent and tobacco 15 per cent, reflecting for the most part
changes in allotment programs.
The original sign-up period for the 1965 Feed Grain, Spring
Uheat, and Cotton Acreage Diversion Programs ended on March 26.
Through March 25, farmers had signed contracts retiring 42 million
acres from production. Sign-ups under the Wheat and Feed Grain
Programs are somewhat larger than last year. Only 800,000 acres
have been signed up for retirement in the Cotton Program out of a total
allotment of 16 million acres. As a result the sign-up period has
been extended for tuo weeks. Apparently, many large cotton producers
prefer to grow full allotments at 29.0 cents per pound rather than

II -11
to cut plantings 35 per cent in return for price support loans at
29.0 cents per pound on their actual production and price support
payments of 4.35 cents per pound on normal yield of their acreage
planted for harvest. Producers with allotments of 15 acres or less
are eligible for price support loans and payments without signing up.
Reports on livestock inventories and producers' plans
indicate that throughout 1965 pork supplies will be substantially
below 1964 levels and that beef supplies may be somewhat larger than
the record supplies of 1964. Less of the beef will be from fed cattle.
Per capita consumption of red meat in 1965 has been estimated by
the Department of Agriculture at 170 pounds, 2 per cent below the
unusually large volume of 1964, with pork dowm 8 per cent and beef up
2 per cent. If these estimates should be realized, per capita red
meat consumption for this year would be 5 per cent higher than in
1960-62, reflecting chiefly a rise of 16 per cent for beef, a decline
of 5 per cent for pork.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL SITUATION
U.S. Government securities market. Yields on U.S. Government
securities turned up in late March and the first few days of April
after drifting down during most of the preceding month. The more
cautious tone in the Treasury bond market was related mainly to
renewed concern over the course of sterling, but the market firmed in
early reaction to the British budget presented on April 6. While the
market was primarily looking to international developments, the domeptic
situation, including publication of net borrowed reserves above $100
million, a lower unemployment rate, and continued strength in bank
loans did impart a minor note of caution.
Trading in longer-term issues was generally light in the
late March-early April period. Still, some selling by dealers and
other temporary holders was more than offset by small net demand from
investors and the System, and dealer holdings of bonds due in more
than 5 years declined from $300 million on March 24 to about $210
million on April 5; these holdings were concentrated in the over 20-
year maturity area. System purchases of over 5-year bonds totaled
$42 million in this period, while purchases of 1-5 year issues amounted
to $25 million.
Treasury bill rates--which had earlier moved down in contrast
to the firmness of other money market rates--edged up in late March
and early April. Pressure on bill rates was maintained from the supply
side. One source of bill supplies recently has been various foreign
and international accounts, which reduced their holdings of bills in

III -2
the custody of the New York Reserve Bank by nearly $500 million between
March 10 and March 31. In addition, the Treasury maintained recent
weekly auctions at $2.2 billion while only $2.0 billion or $2.1 billion
of bills were maturing. Dealers have generally been cautious bidders
in these auctions, receiving smaller awards than earlier this year.
Net market demand,as indicated by dealers' net sales to the
public, had tapered off in the last two statement weeks in March,
although it improvedin early April. Meanwhile, dealers continued to
have to finance bill inventories at relatively high rates, reflecting
in part continued pressure on bank reserve positions, but most recently
financing has been available at the discount rate through System
repurchase agreements.

Treasury financing outlook. The small amounts of new cash
obtained by the Treasury in recent weeks have further enhanced its
relatively comfortable cash position. At the end of March the cash
operating balance had risen to $8.2 billion, as compared with

III -3
$7.9 billion last year at the same time. The cash balance has been
built up during the first quarter with tax collections coming in a
bit higher than patterns implicit in the January budget document,
particularly withheld income and social security taxes. On the
expenditure side, cash payments appear to be running about in track
with, or perhaps somewhat lower than, budget document projections;
military expenditures are coming in below projections, but other cash
outlays, especially agricultural programs and Federal Home Loan Bank
lending, might well turn out above anticipations.
With a cash surplus of about $4.5 billion anticipated for
the second quarter, the Treasury can retire the $3,3 billion of June
tax bills and add further to its cash balance without raising any
new cash in the market until summer, when it has to begin financing
the July-December deficit. The second half deficit is expected to be
in the $11.5-$12 billion range. Net cash borrowing of around $8
billion may be required,compared with $7.3 billion in July-December
1964, with the mid-year cash balance being utilized to finance perhaps
about one-third of the deficit.
The next regularly scheduled financing will be in May, when
the Treasury refunds $4.1 billion of publicly held securities. Terms
will be announced toward the end of April.
Corporate and municipal bond markets. Corporate and municipal
markets have recently reflected increased investor uncertainty about
the course of bond yields over the near-term future. This more
cautious tone, like that in the Government market, has been attributable

III -4
largely to the situation in sterling, to furthe signs of strength
in the domestic economy, and to evidence of tautness in the money
market.
In the corporate bond market, investors have resisted
acceptance of new offerings at yields about 5 basis points below the
year's high reached in early March. As a result, underwriters have
accumulated a sizable unsold inventory of new issues. Yields on
municipal bonds also reached a high for the year in early March, and
have since stabilized at or slightly below that level. However, retail
demand has been relatively weak for many recent offerings.

The over-all volume of new corporate bonds reaching the
public during the past several weeks has been considerably smaller
than the volume early in March. For all of April, the calendar of
public offerings scheduled thus far is about one-third below March.
Almost all of the decline is accounted for by convertible bonds,
however, so that the effects of the smaller over-all volume on bond

III -5
yields may be relatively small. Also, the April volume is about the
same as a year earlier, close to the experience for the year to date.

In the municipal bond market too, the recent supply of new
offerings has declined substantially from early March and the volume
of new offerings estimated for April is the smallest monthly total
since November. But investor enthusiasm for new municipal issues has
not risen so far in anticipation of this cut-back in current and
prospective offerings. Commercial banks in particular appear to have
been less active buyers of municipals, presumably because of a continued
strong loan demand, some slackening of savings inflow, and somewhat more
restrictive reserve availability. As a result, dealers have found it
difficult to reduce their advertised inventories of unsold securities
much below $750 million for any sustained period of time.
Stock market. Common stock prices, as measured by Standard
and Poor's index of 500 stocks, have continued to fluctuate within a
narrow range below the record high of 87.58 reached in early February.
Since late February, this sideways price movement has been accompanied

III -6
by a sharply lower trading volume. In the week ending April 2 trading
averaged 4.7 million shares per day, substantially below the unusually
high 6.4 million daily average reached in the last week of February,
and the smallest average daily volume for any week since December.
The recent lack of direction in the popular stock price
averages seems to reflect a number of cross currents. On the one hand
news reports directly related to the current state of the economy have
continued good. At the same time, however, uncertainties arising
from the Vietnam situation, the approaching deadline of steel labor
negotiations, and the state of the British pound have acted as market
depressants. Furthermore, funds available for stock market purchases
on the Exchanges have recently been reduced by the Federal Government's
public sale of $343 million in General Aniline stock and by an unusually
heavy volume of new convertible debentures, which have more appeal
for stock investors than nonconvertible bond offerings. Finally,
secondary stock offerings--led by the sizable liquidation of DuPont
holdings in General Motors--have been unusually large recently; and
selling pressure has been reported on the Exchanges stemming from
investors' needs for funds to meet April income tax liabilities.
Mortgage markets. Lender competition for mortgages has
continued through the first quarter of the year as mortgage funds
generally have remained ample. While still not particularly high,
purchasing activity in the secondary market by the Federal National
Mortgage Association has been at a more advanced level in recent months
than in most of the past two years. According to FNMA, this, however,

III -7
has reflected broadened activity in mortgages owed by rural and
moderate income families rather than a general shift in private
investor demands.
In the market for conventional mortgages on homes, interest
rates remained stable in February according to the Federal Home Loan
Bank Board. While loan amounts and other nonrate terms were generally
more liberal than a year ago, they continued somewhat less liberal
than more recently. A similar pattern prevailed for loans on existing
homes, except in the case of loan-to-price ratios which moved to a
new high in February.
Savings and loan dividend rates. At the end of March, a
number of savings and loan associations in the Los Angeles area raised
dividend rates about 10 basis points to levels that provide effective
annual returns of slightly more than 5 per cent. For the most part
the increases were initiated by relatively small State-chartered stock
companies. Since real estate markets in the Los Angeles area have
weakened in recent months, the rate advances were probably largely
defensive. During January and February net inflows of savings to all
associations in California were only half as large as in the same
period of 1964, and there is some concern that the short-fall will be
even greater in April as tax payers attempt to adjust for earlier
underwithholding on Federal income tax liabilities.
In an effort to head off a possible general advance in
savings and loan dividend rates, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board
recently requested Home Loan Banks to refuse expansion credit (advances

III -8
for purposes other than coverage of withdrawals) to member associations
that have raised dividend rates since the end of last year. This
prohibition is not applicable, however, to associations where the
increased rate is no higher than 4-1/4 per cent or the prevailing rate
for the region at the end of 1964. The Bank Board also disclosed that
it recently ordered 35 insured associations to cut dividend rates
unless their reserves against risk assets were brought up to Board
requirements by the end of March.
Bank credit. Reflecting continued strong loan demand, bank
credit rose substantially further in March. Early estimates for seasonally
adjusted credit at all commercial banks indicate that growth may have
been somewhat larger than in either January or February--probably around
$3,5 billion. Over the first quarter as a whole the annual rate of
growth may approximate 13 per cent compared with about 7 per cent in
the fourth quarter of 1964.
Loans probably will show a record postwar seasonally adjusted
rise of more than $3.5 billion in March, reflecting heavy borrowing in
most major loan categories. Holdings of municipal and agency issues,
however, showed little change after a sharp decline in the rate of
acquisitions in February. Holdings in March, however, were influenced
by a large temporary run-off of New York State tax anticipation notes
at the month-end. To meet loan demand in the context of reduced
reserve availability and reduced time deposit inflows, banks not only
curtailed the rate of acquisition of municipal and agency issues, but
also made large reductions in their holdings of U.S. Government securities,
mainly in Treasury bills.

III -9
Following some slackening in late February and early March,
business loan demand at city banks strengthened again beginning around
the mid-March tax date. Borrowing was unusually heavy during the tax
week and again in the week of March 31. At all commercial banks the
seasonally adjusted rise was probably close to the February increase
of $1.1 billion, more than twice the monthly average rise over the
year 1964.
A substantial part of the business loan rise continued to
reflect borrowing by metals companies, for which the increase in March
was about the same as in March 1960 but less than in March 1956--two
earlier periods of substantial steel inventory accumulation. But strong
loan demand was evident in most other major loan categories as well,
including food processors, trade, textiles, petroleum and chemicals,
and miscellaneous manufacturing and mining. On the other hand, loans
to commodity dealers, which had been increasing contraseasonally during
the dock strike, dropped off more than usual in March and loans to
construction firms rose less than usual.
"Other" loans (including those to consumers) rose by an
unusually large amount in March. Most of the increase occurred late
in the month and presumably was associated in part with the continued
high level of auto-sales but there have also been reports of more
borrowing than usual by individuals to meet April 15 income taxes.
Security loans rose contraseasonally reflecting substantial borrowing
for purchasing and carrying non-Government issues. Loans to nonbank
financial institutions are also expected to show a seasonally adjusted

III -10
increase in March due in part to temporary end-of-month borrowing.
City bank acquisitions of real estate mortgages continued in March
about one-third below the year earlier pace, as they have since the
beginning of the year.
Money supply and time deposits. The seasonally adjusted money
supply increased $700 million in March following a decline of similar
amount in February. Substantial growth in the first half of March,
when U.S. Government deposits declined much more than usual, was followed
by a small reduction in the second half associated in part with a
subsequent sharp build-up in Treasury balances. Over the first quarter,
growth in the money supply was at an annual rate of 1 per cent compared
with 3.5 per cent in the fourth quarter of 1964.
Growth in time and savings deposits slackened markedly in
March to a seasonally adjusted rate of $1.3 billion, over $1 billion
below the unusually sharp January-February expansion but the same as
the average monthly rise in the second half of 1964. At city banks,
savings deposits growth has continued large, while other time deposits,
excluding negotiable CD's, rose by less than half the January-February
rate. Outstanding CD's increased somewhat further over the four weeks
ending March 24 as heavy sales early in the month and again in the
post-tax week more than offset record tax and dividend period maturities.
By March 31, CD's at banks in New York City had more than regained
their peak March 10 level, while at Chicago banks they were still a
little below and at other banks considerably below earlier highs.
Following the rate increases in early 1957 and 1962, the initial
surge of time and savings deposit inflows continued through the first

III -11
quarter. This was followed by a sharp temporary drop in the growth
rate for a month or two, after which it rose and leveled off about
one-third below the first quarter level. This year, the reaction to
the initial surge appears to have occurred somewhat sooner than in 1957
and 1962. Factors accounting for this earlier slowdown were: (1) the
concentration of rate increases on January 1 this year in contrast
with a more extended transition to higher rates in these earlier periods,
(2) heavy needs for funds this year to participate in large secondary
distributions of General Aniline and General Motors stock, and (3) the
marked slackening after January in the inflow of time deposits from
corporations, which were less important levelers of such deposits in
these earlier periods.
Over the first quarter, growth in money supply plus tine and
savings deposits at commercial banks combined grew at an annual rate
of 8.8 per cent, about the same as in the fourth quarter. Moreover,
a more comprehensive figure for total liquid asset holdings by the
public continued to rise in January and February at about the $3
billion per month rate which has prevailed over the past three years.
Bank reserves. Net borrowed reserves rose in late March
and early April after averaging about $30 million over the first four
weeks of March. The increase largely reflected a higher level of
borrowings, although this rise was associated in part with seasonal
borrowing by Chicago banks in connection with the April 1 personal
property tax assessment date. The effective rate on Federal funds was
above 4 per cent on 11 days between February 25 and April 6 and never

III -12
below that level. Transactions took place generally in the 4-4-1/8
per cent range and at lower rates on only 6 days.

U.S. balance of payments. An over-all payments deficit in the first
quarter of about $300 million is tentatively indicated by the incomplete
data now available. This quarterly total includes an estimated surplus
for March of around $500 million, which may require substantial revision
when fuller figures become available around the middle of the month. Seasonal
factors are favorable in the first quarter by an amount greater than $300
million. Thus after adjustment for seasonal influences, the first quarter
deficit would appear to have been something over $600 million or, roughly,
$2-1/2 billion at an annual rate. This would be about the same as in the
second and third quarters of 1964, and less than half the rate in the fourth
quarter.
The deficit in the first quarter appears to have been very largely
financed by "official settlements" -- changes in U.S. reserve assets and
in liabilities to foreign official institutions together with receipts from
special transactions. In the past, the first quarter has usually seena aeasoaal
reconstitution of foreign commercial bank balances here tending to reduce
dollar accruals to foreign monetary authorities. Making a crude allowance
for this seasonal behavior, the adjusted deficit in the first quarter calcu-
lated on the "official settlements" basis would appear to have been very
large, and about as large as in the last three months of 1964.
Comparing the development of the payments deficit during the
first quarter of this year with that of a year earlier, there was a very
large deficit in February as compared with a negligible deficit in
February 1964, and a surplus in March perhaps about twice as large as
that recorded a year earlier. Statistics helping to explain these

differential movements are almost wholly lacking. However, the large
February deficit presumably reflected among other things the reportedly
heavy outflows of long-term bank loans early in the month prior to the
President's balance of payments message. Part of the surplus registered
in March was the result of the pattern observable last year of U.S.
corporations investing funds at short-term abroad and repatriating
them prior to the quarterly tax date. But the larger size of the
March surplus than a year ago may indicate a bigger than usual reflux
of such funds, possibly influenced by the balance of payments program.
The March surplus was reflected principally in a decline in balances
held here by commercial banks abroad (including U.S. bank branches)._ __ _II_ _ __
: I [

IV -3
One uncertainty in any appraisal of recent developments in the
payments position has been the impact of the dock strike on the flow of
external payments and receipts, Recorded movements of both exports and
imports were cut sharply in January. While imports in February rebounded
to about the fourth quarter average rate, exports recovered much less to
a rate still about 30 per cent below the fourth quarter average. The
better recovery of imports may have been due to priority being assigned
to the unloading of inbound ships and to the clearance of their cargo
from the docks before export shipments were handled. Despite the delays
in shipments, it may be presumed that most payments for exports and
imports were effected on schedule; to the extent, however, that payments
were disrupted as well, the result would have been to enlarge the
deficit in January and February with a possible compensatory diminution
of the deficit in March.
Substantial progress has reportedly been made in the past month
in clearing the docks but partial embargoes on rail shipments to ports
apparently are continuing. Until normal schedules are restored, current
trends in exports and imports will be obscured.
One indicator of demands for U.S. exports is provided by
monthly data on new export orders for durable goods excluding autos,
covering about one-third of total exports. These orders increased
sharply at the end of 1963 and remained at an advanced level (above
sales) throughout 1964 and in January this year. Unfilled export orders
increased from $2.6 billion in December 1963 to $3.2 billion a year
later. Half of this increase was for aircraft. Order books for other
durables appear not to have lengthened since the middle of last year.

IV -4
Credit conditions abroad. Monetary and credit policies in
Europe remained generally restrictive during the first quarter of 1965,
except in Italy. Between December and March, long-term bond yields rose
considerably in Germany, eased slightly in Belgium, the Netherlands
Switzerland and -- at least through January -- declined further in Italy.
In the short-term area, money rates eased more than seasonally in Switzerland,
and tightened in the Euro-dollar market.

The initial impact of the U.S. balance of payments program on
financial markets abroad was most clearly evident in the Euro-dollar
market, where rates moved up abruptly from February 10 to new highs on
March 10. In addition, it was clear that the U.S. program would produce
further demands on domestic credit supplies in European countries as U.S.

IV -5
subsidiaries and other European residents turned to local sources for
financing in place of U.S. bank loans and parent company funds.
A particularly large influx of loan applications from U.S. sub-
sidiaries was reported in Belgium. As part of the anti-inflationary
program, credit guidelines (in terms of recommended maximum annual increases
in outstanding bank loans) are still in effect in Belgium, but the central
bank has reportedly advised Belgian banks that borrowing by U.S. subsidiaries
from local sources occasioned by our program may be exempted from the credit
guidelines. Reportedly, more than half the financing of the new General
Motors plant in Antwerp -- the cost of which is currently estimated at
over $80 million -- will be provided by local banks, with the remainder
coming from undistributed profits. From Stockholm, it is reported that
some Swedish banks, which normally finance in New York a considerable
amount of Swedish trade with Latin America, may have to resort to inter-
bank borrowing within Sweden at an added cost of 1 per cent.
Such pressures as these could eventually be reflected in higher
interest rates in many European national markets unless offset by modifi-
cations in central bank policies. Also, high rates in the Euro-dollar
market may tend to attract liquid funds from national markets; linkage of
rates with those in the Euro-dollar market has been particularly noticeable
in the U.K. local authority deposit market. But evidence thus far of
tendencies for rates to harden in Continental centers is limited.
Ease in the Swiss money market since the turn of the year has
probably been a consequence of the heavy movements out of sterling that
occurred in late 1964. With inflows to Switzerland apparently reduced,

IV -6
especially since the U.S. program was announced, the decline in the Swiss
franc exchange rate during the first quarter has reflected the continuing
current account deficit and possibly also outflows of Swiss bank funds
attracted by high Euro-dollar interest rates.
Euro-dollar interest rates have eased off somewhat since March 10,
but early this week remained about 1/2 of 1 per cent above year-ago levels.
The spread of the 90-day Euro-dollar rate over U.S. CD's is wider by about
1/8 of 1 per cent than a year ago.

United Kingdom. The generally restrictive tone of British
financial markets was not significantly altered during the first quarter.
In the money market, tight conditions continued unabated. In January, it
appeared that effects of the 7 per cent Bank rate and the general shortage
of funds might spread beyond the bank loan market; building societies
raised mortgage rates generally by 1/2 to 3/4 of 1 per cent. Following

IV -7
a temporary pause in early February, markets tightened again as a reduced
supply of loan funds forced local authorities to compete actively in the
deposit market. After the U.S. balance of payments program was announced
on February 10, local authority deposit rates -- then about 7.2 per cent --
rose dramatically further along with Euro-dollar rates,
In contrast, U.K. Treasury bill yields moved down a little during
the first quarter. A much reduced supply of bills at the weekly tenders
reflecting the customary seasonal revenue surplus, together with recurrent
rumors of a Bank rate decrease, led the discount houses to raise bid prices.
In order to discourage rumors regarding Bank rate action and to moderate
the decline in the bill yield, the Bank of England forced the discount
houses to borrow at Bank rate intermittently in February and March. On
March 19, after a few days of heavy borrowing, the discount houses lowered
their bid to such an extent that the market yield rose 15 basis points to
6.35 per cent, marginally above the average February level. On April 2
the bill yield was unchanged at 6.35 per cent.
France. The Paris money market was easy during most of the
first quarter, in part because of the balance of payments surplus. The
authorities raised the banks' required liquid assets ratio to 36 per cent
in January, following temporary reductions toward the end of 1964, but
this was clearly a technical adjustment to seasonal requirements. Except
for customary end-of month tightness, the rate for day-to-day money has
been close to the Bank of France's basic discount rate of 4 per cent,
which tends to act as a floor to market rates.
Despite the recession in economic activity that set in last
autumn, the authorities have maintained the 10 per cent per annum ceiling

IV -8
on bank credit expansion. It is not clear whether credit expansion is
still continuing to press against the ceiling. The ease in the money
market -- which is exclusively an interbank market -- gives no adequate
clue, since restraint may be imposed by the ceiling regulation consistently
with quite a wide range of conditions in the money market. Government
bond yields have registered only negligible changes during the quarter,
while yields on corporate fixed interest securities have shown a flat trend.
Virtually the only notable financial development occurred in
the Paris gold market, where gold coins have held at greatly av nces
prices throughout the quarter because French purchases of gold, together
with President de Gaulle's pronouncements on the gold standard, created
new doubts about maintenance of the U.S. official price for gold. For
example, the price of the "Napoleon" 20-franc piece, which averaged 41.28
francs last December, climbed to 42.80 francs on January 8 and to 44.30
francs -- its highest level since 1952 -- on March 10. The price receded
to 43.70 francs on March 26.
Germany. German financial markets last month were dominated
by the approach of the important March 15 tax date. Cessation of an
abnormal pre-February 10 inflow of U.S. capital and credit to Germany,
noted in market reports, may have contributed to the seasonal rise in rates.
Day-to-day money rates moved up by a rather significant margin, from about
3 per cent in mid-February to roughly 4 per cent in the first half of March.
To help meet seasonal requirements, German commercial banks let
their holdings of U.S. Treasury bills under the preferential swap arr egement
with the Bundesbank decline by about $90 million from March 10 to March 24.

IV -9
However, the substantial rise in the premium on the three-month forward
DM in the second week of March, reversing the February decline, may
suggest that German banks were placing funds in the Euro-dollar market,
where they can earn more than by holding U.S. Treasury bills under the
preferential arrangement.
Since the turn of the year German bond prices have been weakening.
This tendency, apparent even before the German discount rate increase of
January 22, was reinforced by this indication of the authorities'
determination to maintain a restrictive policy. Yields on a representative
long-term bond moved up from 6.42 per cent at year-end to 6.63 per cent in
mid-March.
Italy. Italy provides the single important exception to the
generally restrictive posture of monetary and credit policy in Europe.
A shift in monetary policy occurred last August, and since then bank
loans and investments have increased significantly.
The cutback in economic activity caused by the 1964-64 stabiliza-
tion program apparently came to an end by late 1964 but, in the absence
of clear evidence of a definite upturn, the Italian authorities have
recently moved to spur lagging output, especially in the building sector.
A decree law approved by the Cabinet on March 13 provides a program of
loans for various public works (agriculture, schools, housing, roads
and ports) to be financed from the proceeds of bond issues by the Credit
Consortium for Public Works, which will be authorized to borrow $400
million equivalent in Italy and abroad. In addition, the Postal Savings
Fund will lend $600 million equivalent, over an unspecified period of time,

IV -10
to local authorities; some of the funds for these loans will amost
certainly be obtained indirectly from the Bank of Italy. These stepped-
up financing programs indicate that the Italian authorities have decided
that the time has come to use fiscal as well as monetary measures to
stimulate demand.
Japan. The Bank of Japan's basic discount rate was reduced
effective April 3 to 5.84 per cent, the level at which it stood before
the tightening of monetary policy in December 1963. Quarterly credit
expansion quotas for the large city banks have been sharply liberalized.
While the authorities do not want to encourage a new over-
expansion of investment based on bank credit, they wish to reduce the
pressures that have contributed to numerous recent bankruptcies and
financial reorganizations of business companies. Industrial ptoduction
has stabilized at a high level since last autumn. The trade balance in
January-February was sharply improved from November-December, with exports
up and imports down. However, wholesale and consumer prices continued to
rise through February; the wholesale index in that month was 1.2 per cent
above last year's low in June.

APPENDIX A: MARCH LENDING PRACTICES SURVEY
The results of the third quarterly survey of changes in bank
lending practices conducted as of March 15, 1965 are summarized in the
following paragraphs and accompanying table. Reports were received
from the 81 banks that report in the quarterly interest rate survey.
Most of the banks experienced continued strength in loan
demand. Well over half of the banks (45 out of 81) reported that de-
mand for commercial and industrial loans had strengthened in the first
quarter, and half of these had also indicated increased loan demand in
the December survey. Another 14 per cent (11 banks) reported stronger
loan demand in December with no change in March, making a total of
seven-tenths of the banks where loan demand had strengthened in one of
the two quarters. Factors reported to account for the increased demand
included the dock strike, steel stockpiling and tax payments. One bank
stated that the demand was principally for future commitments, mainly
for capital expenditures.
The most striking changes reported in lending practices were
in interest rates and compensating balance requirements for business
borrowers. Forty-six banks (nearly three-fifths of the total) indicated
that they had firmed policy in the first quarter with respect to interest
rates charged and over half of these (25 banks) had also tightened
policies on size of compensating balances. Another four banks showed
firmer policies on compensating balances but no change in interest rates.
Looking at both the December and March surveys, two-thirds of the banks
had firmer policies on interest rates and about half on compensating
balances in one or both of the surveys. Firmer policies in both surveys
were reported by one-third of the banks for interest rates, and by more
than one-fourth for compensating balances.
The reason most often given for firmer policies on interest
rates and compensating balances was the need to improve gross income
to offset higher rates paid on time deposits. Another reason for the
firming of lending practices often was the individual bank's high loan-
deposit ratio.
The proportions of banks reporting firmer policies in March
on other terms and conditions of loans to business borrowers were
considerably smaller than in the case of interest rates and compensating
balances. About one-fifth of the banks had firmer policies on standards
of credit worthiness of the borrower, about 12 per cent with respect
to type and amount of collateral required and 11 per cent with respect
to maturity of loan. Most of the banks with firmer policies in these
areas had reported increased loan demand in December or March or in both
surveys. Only rarely did a bank that indicated no change in loan demand'
on both surveys report any change in these terms and conditions of credit.

Aggressiveness in seeking new business loans appeared to be
inversely related to strength of loan demand. Fifteen banks reported
greater aggressiveness in seeking new business loans in the first
quarter and most of these were banks that reported no change or weaker
loan demand in this period, By contrast, nine banks in the March sur-
vey reported less aggressiveness in seeking new loans and all but one
of these indicated increased loan demand in the first quarter.
With respect to term loans, nine banks indicated less willing-
ness to make such loans while only three were more willing. Also, only
three banks in the March survey indicated willingness to make term loans
with longer maximum maturities than before. However, all of these were
banks which reported increased loan demand. Competition both from other
banks and nonbank financial institutions coupled with substantial growth
in time deposits were given as reasons for this change.
In extending credit to new business borrowers as well as to
nonlocal service area customers, less than three-tenths of the banks
reported firmer policies in the March survey, a slightly lower proportion
than in December. As in earlier surveys, very few banks reported firmer
policies for established and for local service area customers.
Banks stating that the applicant's value as a depositor was
more important than three months earlier represented three-tenths of the
total, also a smaller proportion than in earlier surveys. The use of
the proceeds of the loan was considered more important at about one-
fourth of the banks, a slightly higher proportion than in December.
Practices in lending to finance companies also firmed in
March but to a lesser extent than for nonfinancial businesses. Thirteen
banks (16 per cent of the total) reported firmer policies on interest
rates charged and 9 banks (11 per cent of the total) on compensating
balance requirements. Five of the 13 reporting firmer interest rates
also had firmed policies on compensating balances, with the remaining
banks firming interest rates only. The proportion of banks reporting
firmer policies in these areas has increased in each of the last three
surveys and in March for the first time, two large Nel York City banks
reported firmer policies. With respect to enforcement of balance re-
quirements and establishing new or larger credit lines for finance
companies, somewhat more than one-fifth of the banks reported firmer
policies in March, about the same as in other surveys.
The firming of interest rate policies on loans to nonfinancial
businesses indicated in the March lending practices survey contrasts
with a slight decline in the average rate reported on short-term business
loans by the same banks in the quarterly interest rate survey. Only
loans in the smallest size class--less than $10,000 in amount--showed
an increase from December to March, with rates on loans of larger size

-3-
remaining the same or declining slightly. A major factor contributing
to the decline was the increased dollar volume of loans made at the
prime rate, which reached the unusually high proportion of 58 per cent
in the March Survey.
While a further explanation for the apparent disparity be-
tween the two surveys must await further investigation, one contribut-
ing factor may have been a change in loan mix between December and
March, probably in part of a seasonal nature. In four out of the past
five years, average rates on short-term business loans declined in the
first quarter. Moreover, the increased proportion of loans made at
the prime rate in March, at a time when banks indicate that they have
been trying to reduce the number of customers eligible for that rate,
suggests that the composition of demand had shifted toward prime
customers. Changes in the average size of loan did not appear to be
an important factor affecting the change in rates from December to
March.
