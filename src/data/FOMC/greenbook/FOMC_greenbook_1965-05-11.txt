through a comprehensive digitization proce ss which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain.

IN BROAD REVIEW
Changes reported in the domestic economic scene since early
March have been of a kind generally conducive to further expansion in
activity over the near-term without widespread price advances. Tempor-
ary extension of the steel labor contract on a noninflationary basis
has allayed concern that a wage-price spiral might develop from that
source. And at the same time it has given steel users time to reappraise
their inventory needs in a less hectic atmosphere. Another major
development was the McGraw-Hill plant and equipment survey which raised
the projected outlays for this year well above those reported earlier.
Other indications of continued economic expansion include the
materially improved performance of the labor market in March, with the
gains apparently holding in April. Industrial production rose 1 point
further in March to an index of 140 and a further but more modest rise
seems likely for April.
Retail sales, although at very high levels, apparently were
off a little in March and probably also in April, as auto sales did
not show the usual large seasonal rise from the advanced January-
February levels. Late spring in some parts of the country and storms
and floods in the Midwest also may have contributed to the easing in
reported retail sales.
Business inventory accumulation generally appears to be con-
tinuing under control with accumulation in the first quarter initially
estimated only moderately above the fourth quarter rate. Steel stocks
have increased further to levels above those reached in comparable
periods in 1962 and 1963 and some protective build-ups have also appar-
ently developed in related industries.

1- 2
Pressure on commodity prices increased somewhat, particularly
in the metals and machinery areas, but in the latest week the index
for industrial prices as a whole was only .1 per cent above the stable
first quarter level and about at the early 1960 high. Consumer prices
rose .1 per cent further in March.
Bank credit expansion, which was unusually large in March,
dropped back in April to about the average monthly rise in 1964.
Business loan expansion was vigorous on balance in April, although less
than the very rapid rise during the first quarter when a number of
unusual factors, including the steel inventory build-up, the dock
strike, and phenomenal auto sales affected demands for credit.
Time deposit growth slackened further to less than $1 bil-
lion in April. The stimulative effect of the increase late last year
in Regulation Q ceiling rates seemed to be wearing off more quickly
than in earlier periods of Regulation Q change. The money supply,
meanwhile, increased rapidly in April for the second month in succes-
sion, following three months of little net change.
Bank reserve positions tightened further in April, Net bor-
rowed reserves averaged $140 million during the April reserve weeks,
as compared with $50 million in March. Federal funds traded at an
effective rate of 4-1/8 per cent on two-thirds of the business days
in April.
Despite tighter reserve positions, Treasury bill rates re-
ceded 4 or 5 basis points from mid-April to early May when the 90-day
bill was 3.90. Bond yields moved up a little for most Treasury and
corporate issues and municipal securities held close to their highs

I- 3
for the year. Stock market prices, impelled by favorable business and
labor news and sharply higher profits in the first quarter, rose to a
new high in early May, when the Standard and Poor's index was more than
2 per cent above its former peak in early February.
The May Treasury refunding operation, announced April 28,
apparently has met with a favorable market response. The Treasury
cash balance is unusually large and is likely to continue so at least
through June.
A further surplus in the U. S. balance of payments is indi-
cated for April by partial data, but the surplus will probably be
sharply reduced from the $500 million record in March (not seasonally
adjusted). The over-all payments deficit in the first quarter is nou
estimated at a $3 billion seasonally adjusted annual rate, about half
the size of the deficit in the fourth quarter of 1964. The reduction
in the deficit resulted principally from lower net outflows of private
capital, particularly purchases of new foreign security issues and
short-term capital outflows. Effects of the interest equalization tax
and the voluntary program to restrain outflows of long-term bank loans
after February 10 were offset by the very large outflows in the first
six weeks of the quarter.
The exchange market for sterling has been somewhat stronger
in the past three weeks. Relaxation of uncertainties about the two
reserve currencies has been reflected in the London gold market. The
gold price has declined by more than 6 cents per ounce from the point
reached on April 15 to $35.108 on May 5. Current demands are being met
out of new gold production.

I-4
Abroad, there is further evidence of a gradual recovery in
Italian economic activity and some indications that the decline in
French industrial production since last fall did not go further in the
early months of 1965. In Germany, industrial order backlogs have begun
to lengthen again.
In Britain, where advances in wages and prices are continuing,
further action was taken at the end of April to restrain bank lending.

THE DOMESTIC ECONOMY
Industrial production. Industrial production in April is
estimated to have increased somewhat further from the March level of
140 per cent. Available production data are too sketchy to indicate
the size of the April change but it will probably be smaller than the
March rise of one point. Output of business equipment and materials
is expected to increase further while production of consumer goods is
expected to change little.
Auto assemblies in April declined 5 per cent from the record
March level, but at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 9.4 million
units, they were still 15 per cent above a year earlier. Production
schedules for May and June indicate that assemblies will be maintained
at about the recent rate. Output of home goods and apparel is expected
to change little in April. Television production rose early in the
month, however, as output of color sets increased further.
In April, truck production rose and was at a record rate.
Output of steel ingots increased further as consumption of steel
apparently continued upward and demands for stockpiling continued
strong. In early April, output of coal increased and paperboard
production continued high. Output of crude oil and refined petroleum
products was maintained in large volume.
In March, inventories of finished steel mill products held
by steel consumers (manufacturers) rose by 1.1 million tons to a
total of 13.6 million tons, according to the special Census report
which shows data without seasonal adjustment. In the preceding

II -2
five months such accumulation had averaged 600,000 tons per month.
Steel consumption rose in March and steel mills in order to meet
consumer demands reduced their own stocks of semi-finished steel.
Steel consumption and inventories of steel users were well above the
highs in 1962 and 1963, as shown in the table.

March 1965 13.6 6,2 2.2
1/ Consumption data are for May in 1962 and 1963, the peak rate in
the first half of each year.
In the first four months following the labor contract settle-
ments in 1962 and 1963, steel production dropped 25 per cent and 29
per cent respectively. In both cases, the loss amounted to about
1.5 points in the total index, The extension of the present contract
seems to present at least two alternatives regarding the course of
steel production in the near future. An early settlement--which most
observers think is unlikely--would probably lead to sharp production
curtailment comparable to those experienced in 1962 and 1963. If
contract negotiations appear likely to continue through the summer,
however, inventory accumulation may taper off and production might
decline only moderately. Actual inventory liquidation and sharp
production curtailment might then be deferred until either a settle-
ment is reached or a strike is called,

II -3
Retail sales. Retail sales in March and April were moderately
below their record February level, after allowances for the usual
seasonal variation and the changing date of Easter. The March total
(according to revised data) was down nearly 2 per cent from February
and preliminary data for April suggest a fractional further decline.
Meanwhile, personal income has continued to rise.
Sales of both durable and nondurable goods were off from their
highs, but the decline was more pronounced for durable goods. Auto
sales failed to show all the usual large seasonal rise from the sharply
advanced February level, and seasonally adjusted sales declined
considerably between February and April. Other durable goods showed
only a slight decline.
Sales of nondurable goods were reduced about 1 per cent in
March, with the largest decline at apparel stores. In April, sales at
nondurable goods outlets appear to have held at the March level.

Unit sales of domestic automobiles were at an annual rate
of 8.2 million vehicles in April, as compared with 8.8 in March.
Sales during the last 10 days of the month dipped below their level
a year earlier for the first time since the autumn strike. Floods
and the special income tax situation this year may have been partly
responsible, but it appears likely that the strike backlog of orders
which sustained record sales earlier this year has been largely used
up. The average rate of sales over the first seven months of the
current model year was 8.3 million vehicles, compared with a rate of
7.7 million in the same period of the 1964 model year.
Consumer credit. Consumers added $637 million to their
instalment debt in March, about the same as in February. For the first
quarter as a whole, instalment credit rose at a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of $7.8 billion, in dollar amount the highest on record.
In percentage terms, however, the net addition to debt was less than
in some of the peak quarters in 1955 and 1959.
Auto credit continued to increase at a rapid pace despite
some slowing in auto sales. This type of credit accounted for 48
per cent of the expansion in total instalment debt in the January-
March period as compared with 41 per cent for all of 1964. Other
types of credit have also continued to expand, although at a less
rapid rate than auto paper. Personal loans advanced at a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of $2,1 billion in the first quarter while other
consumer goods paper increased at a rate of $1.8 billion. Both
rates were somewhat above those for 1964.

II -5
Construction and real estate. Outlays for new construction
edged down in April, according to preliminary estimates, from the
record March total. The slight decline occurred mainly in public
activity, with other major categories showing little change.
With completions of new dwellings and other net additions
to the housing supply exceeding net new household formation, residential
vacancy rates in the first quarter averaged a little higher than in
the same period of the preceding two years. Inside metropolitan
areas--where nearly all new high-rise apartment building has been
taking place--rental vacancy rates reached a postwar high for the
quarter. Outside these areas, rental vacancy rates were also up but
appreciably below earlier highs. By region, year-over-year changes
in average rental vacancy rates were mixed. Increases were reported
in the Northeast and West, a decline in the North Central states
and no change in the South.
Plant and equipment expenditures. Business expenditures for
new plant and equipment this year will be 15 per cent larger than
last year, according to the McGraw-Hill survey conducted in March
and early April. This increase compares with an anticipated rise of
12 per cent reported in February in the Commerce-SEC survey. The
larger rise indicated by the McGraw-Hill survey comes from stepped-up
spending plans for manufacturing, mining, and public utilities.
Only for railroads have earlier spending plans been reduced. Every
major industry except shipbuilding and railroad equipment manufacturers
now plans larger outlays this year than last, and outlays by these
two industries will equal last year's.

II -6
New plant and equipment expenditures of $51.7 billion now
planned by business would account for 7.8 per cent of a projected
gross national product of $661 billion this year. The proportion
last year was 7.2 per cent and in 1956, when capital outlays soared
22 per cent, the proportion was 8.4 per cent and was followed by a
recession.
Business also now plans fixed capital outlays over the next
three years to continue at a very high level. The nonferrous metals,
rubber, and electric and gas utilities industries even have tentative
spending plans for the next three years which average more than their
planned outlays this year, and expenditures planned for next year
by iron and steel producers and by the railroads exceed their plans
for this year.
Manufacturers as a group reported they were operating at
88 per cent of capacity at the end of 1964, up from 85 per cent a year
earlier. Manufacturers' preferred operating rate is 92 per cent.
Several industries were operating at or above their preferred rates,
notably nonferrous metals, rubber, textiles, and food and beverages.
Producers of motor vehicles and parts and apparently also iron and
steel producers were operating very close to their desired rates.
All of these industries, as well as some others, have relatively
large increases in capital outlays planned for this year.
Manufacturers now plan to increase their capacity by nearly
6 per cent this year as compared with 4 per cent last year. All
industries except the petroleum and coal products group plan larger

II -7
increases in capacity this year than last. The motor vehicles group
and chemical producers indicate plans for 8 per cent increases in
capacity,
Manufacturers' plans to accelerate capacity growth are
also evident in greater emphasis on expansion of facilities in
contrast to modernization. They now plan to devote 45 per cent of
this year's capital outlays to expansion, and a slightly larger
proportion during the 1966-68 period. In the period from 1959-1964,
spending for expansion was only about one-third of total fixed
investment.
The need for additional capacity stems, along with the
pressure of higher operating rates, from expectations of substantial
increases in sales. A 7 per cent increase in physical volume of
sales this year and a 19 per cent further increase by 1968 is anticipated.
Expenditures for research and development are being increased con-
siderably more this year than last, and substantial further increases
are planned for the next three years.
Businesses will continue to rely heavily on their own
resources to finance their capital spending programs this year. But
they also anticipate increasing their external financing for all
purposes by 5 per cent. In 1964, according to the survey, the
reduction in corporate income tax rates, liberalized depreciation
rates, and investment tax credits combined to boost capital investment
by nearly $1 billion. These inducements are expected to continue to
stimulate fixed capital spending in 1965.

Orders for durable goods. New orders for durable goods,
which were about unchanged in February, rose 2-1/2 per cent in March
to a new high. With sales up by a larger percentage, the backlog of
unfilled orders stabilized after a steady advance over the preceding
14 months. Unfilled orders represented 2.6 months' shipments at the
advanced March rate as compared with 2.5 months in late 1963.
New orders for machinery and equipment rose in March, after
declining moderately in February, and were at a new high, slightly

II -9
above the advanced levels reached last spring. New orders--and
shipments--rose sharply in the auto industry in March. On the other
hand, in the steel industry new orders showed a large decline and,
with shipments up sharply, the order backlog declined appreciably
after months of steady advance. However, the steel order backlog
at the and of March was about double the year-earlier level. Outside
the steel industry unfilled orders for durable goods were up 11
per cent.
Manufacturers' inventories. Seasonally adjusted book value
of manufacturers' inventories increased only $280 million in March,
bringing the increase for the first quarter to $700 million. This
increase was the same amount manufacturers had anticipated in February
and was sharply below the extraordinary $1.9 billion increase in the
fourth quarter. Inventory accumulation by durable goods manufacturers
totaled about $500 million and was down from almost $1.4 billion in
the fourth quarter. In nondurable goods industries, the increase was
$200 million in the first quarter as compared with $550 million in
the fourth quarter.
In March as in February, the bulk of the stock increase
was in steel-fabricating lines in the durable goods sector. Sales
of both durable and nondurable goods rose sharply in March, and
stock-sales ratios remained low.

II -10
Labor costs.- Unit labor costs for all employees in
manufacturing in March continued below levels of a year ago although
they have risen somewhat since December. Premium pay for increased
overtime hours worked has been mainly responsible for the recent
rise, as basic wage rates apparently have been advancing at about
the same pace as earlier. Fringe cost increases, however, have
slowed up somewhat and the rise from a year earlier was somewhat
less than in similar periods in other recent years. The effect of
the change in fringe costs on total unit labor costs, however, has
been small.
Contract settlements. Increases in hourly compensation in
recent major labor contracts have continued close to the guideposts.
The relatively moderate and long-term nature of the settlements
provides some support to the hope that unit labor costs will remain
relatively stable.
The interim agreement reached in the steel industry postponed
the threat of a possible steel strike at least until September 1.
The companies will put 11.5 cents into escrow to be used for wages
or other benefits to be determined in the final settlement. The
increase amounts to about 2.6 per cent based on average hourly
compensation of $4.40 an hour in the steel industry.
The extension agreement seems to set a lid on retroactivity
but does not commit either side as to the size of the final settlement.
Negotiations prior to the extension, however, considerably narrowed
the original wide differences between the company and the union.

II -11
Union leaders have indicated that they believe the 11.5 cents or 2.6
per cent an hour rise is a "floor" and they are demanding a package
worth 3.2 per cent plus cost of living adjustments. While it is
widely expected that the cost of the final settlement will be higher
than the interim agreement, it is not, at this time, thought that
it will be high in relation to the Administration guidepost.
Negotiations for the new steel contract are scheduled to
be resumed on May 18. On June 1, the new president of the steel union
will take over complete responsibility for reaching an agreement
with the companies. Subcommittees have been set up to settle specific
differences and are scheduled to have final reports ready for the top
bargaining group on July 1. These subcommittees will carry on, in
effect, the same functions as the Human Relations Committee did in
previous negotiations. The reported strike deadline of September 1
is not automatic and requires a formal reopening of the contract. The
parties have the option of continuing negotiations without a reopening.
However, any time after July 30 either side can ask for a reopening
with a 30-day waiting period before a strike can be called.
The rubber settlement provided for increases in wages and
fringes, excluding pensions and insurance, estimated at 28 cents per
hour over the 2-year contract period. The new contract provides for
a 6-1/2 cent an hour wage increase for nontire workers on May 10,
1965, and for a 7-1/2 cent increase for tire workers on June 7. A
year later both groups will receive a 9-cent an hour increase. A
pay inequity correction of 7 cents an hour for skilled or maintenance

II -12
workers, a ninth paid holiday, longer vacations and liberalized
supplementary unemployment benefits are estimated to cost 10 cents
the first year and 1.5 cents an hour additional in the second year
of the contract. Since the above estimates do not include pension
costs of 14 cents for a 3-year period negotiated last year, the
rise in hourly employment costs in the rubber industry is understated
relative to package costs being announced in other industries.
Contracts between the aluminum companies and the steel
workers union expire June 1. In the past, aluminum contracts usually
have been signed after settlements in the steel industry. With
minor exceptions, aluminum settlements have been within the same
framework as the steel agreements. There is a possibility that
aluminum contracts may be extended until after new union officers take
over on June 1.
Steel productivity and labor costs. The Council of Economic
Advisers, in a special report on the steel industry, calculated the
productivity trend in the industry as 3 per cent per year from
1947-1964--when adjusted for changes in steel operating rates. This
rate is close to the guidepost figure of 3.2 per cent for the over-all
private economy. The Council concluded, that if wage increases in
steel this year approximate the economy-wide productivity trend,
labor costs per ton of steel will remain approximately stable. Thus
by implication the report suggests that the steel industry can
increase its final wage settlement somewhat above the 11.5 cents,
or 2.6 per cent, granted in the interim agreement, presumably to

II -13
slightly over 13 cents per hour, or 3 per cent, without raising steel
prices.
What is mainly new in the Council report is the method used
in calculating the industry productivity trend. The current official
BLS output per manhour figures for the steel industry show an average
rise of 2.2 per cent from 1957-1964 (the industry has been using
2 per cent based on the BLS data published late last year for
1957-1963). Because of the wide fluctuations in steel operating
rates, the Council smoothed short-term variations in output per
manhour by introducing the capacity operating rate as a variable into
the trend equation for productivity. A further correction was made
by eliminating the strike-affected third and fourth quarters of 1959
from the analysis. The net result is that the Council calculated
the trend increase in productivity to be 3.0 per cent.
Increases in wage plus fringe costs per manhour have averaged
3,8 per cent per year for the 1957-1964 period for the steel industry.
But the average conceals a rather sharp decline in the rate of
increase during the period. The 1956 contract provided wage and
fringe benefits of 8 per cent per year; the 1960 contract,3.7 per cent;
and the 1962 and 1963 contracts, only 2.5 per cent. Unit labor costs,
therefore, rose between 1957 and 1960-1961 and have declined each
year since then. In 1964, they were slightly below the average for
1958-1959.

The summer of the 18-year olds. During the year ending
July 1, 3.7 million young persons will have celebrated their 18th
birthday, one million more than one year or two years earlier. High
schools are expected to graduate 600,000 more this June than in 1963,
while colleges will enroll 300,000 more freshmen this fall than they
did two years earlier.

The influx of teenage students in search of summer work
and graduates looking for permanent jobs usually begins in May and
reaches its peak in June. Additions to the teenage labor force totaled
close to 2.8 million from April to June last year, and 35 per cent of
the increase was reflected in the unemployment series. Assuming no
change in the rate of teenage labor force participation from last
year, total teenage additions to the labor market would be 200,000
more than last year, or about 3.0 million in total.
The labor force participation rate of teenagers has declined
significantly from a year earlier, with much of the drop among young
men since last fall. As a result, the teenage labor force was only
120,000 higher in the first quarter this year than a year earlier.

II -15
This was far short of the annual increase of roughly 400,000 to 500,000
projected for this age group for the period. Nevertheless, teenage
employment rose no faster than the labor force, and the teenage
unemployment rate at 14.5 per cent in the first quarter was the
same as last year.
If there should be a catch-up in their labor force participation
rate in coming months, the number of young people in the labor force
could rise sharply between the first and second quarters of this year,
The unemployment rate for youth in the second quarter is almost
certain to rise because of the large labor force increase expected
this summer in relation to available job opportunities,
Prices. The industrial commodity price index, according to
the weekly estimates, has edged up about .1 per cent from itsstable
first quarter level, and is equal to the peak reached early in 1960.
Most of the rise in the index since last summer has been in the metals
and machinery groups, and an index of industrial commodities excluding
metals and machinery continues to show little change. While trade
reports suggest that price concessions and discounts are no longer
widespread, numerous announced increases in list prices during the
last few months have been quietly rescinded.
Wholesale prices of foodstuffs, continuing the rise that
began early this year, have increased sharply in recent weeks; reduced
marketings of hogs and steers, increasing beef demand, and reduced
supplies of fresh vegetables as a result of unfavorable weather
conditions have been mainly responsible. The total wholesale price

II -16
index in March at 101.6 per cent of the 1957-59 base period, was
marginally above the top of the narrow range within which it has
fluctuated for the last seven years.
In recent weeks the FRB sensitive index and the BLS daily
index, reflecting price increases in nonferrous and steel scrap,
tin, rubber, and some paper products, have risen further. Shortages
of tin, copper, and zinc persist as a result of a continuing rise in
world consumption, and in the case of copper and zinc, also because
of chronic supply disruptions. At the beginning of this week, the
Chilean Government announced a one cent increase in the export price
of copper to 36 cents. Major U.S. and foreign producers followed,
raising prices 2 cents and 3-1/2 cents respectively to match the
new Chilean price, and domestic fabricators have raised prices for
copper products. Prices of copper in the free markets and tin,
although still below earlier peaks, have returned to the high levels
of early December. A zinc release by the GSA was oversubscribed by
three times, while a lead release was undersubscribed.- List prices
have been raised recently for a number of stainless steel products
by up to seven per cent; however, these products account for less
than one per cent of all steel shipments.
The consumer price index rose .1 per cent in March to 109.0
per cent of the 1957-59 average. Services and commodities each rose
.1 per cent to 117.0 and 105.6 per cent, respectively. Prices of
new cars fell about seasonally, and food prices rose mainly because
supplies of fresh vegetables were curtailed by abnormally cold weather.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL SITUATION
Bank credit. Following an unusually large increase in March,
growth in total bank credit receded to $1.6 billion (seasonally adjusted)
in April according to preliminary estimates--the same as the average
monthly rise in 1964. The two months together, however, recorded an
expansion in total bank credit substantially larger than in the same
period a year ago, reflecting mainly the greater increase in business
loans during Nlarch-April 1965. The average monthly increase in total
bank credit in the two months--$2.5 billion--was about the same as
the January-February rate of expansion.
Loan growth in April was much less than in any month so far
in 1965. Thus, the frantic pace of loan expansion earlier in the year,
buoyed by a variety of special factors--the sharp rise in loans to
foreign borrowers in the opening weeks of 1965, the dock strike, the
accumulation of steel inventories, and an exceptionally high level of
auto sales--may now be subsiding, Apart from the miscellaneous "other"
loans category, all types of loans appear to have increased by about
the same amount in April 1965 as they did in the same period a year ago.
There are, nevertheless, signs of continued underlying strength
in credit demands faced by the banking system, especially from business
borrowers. City bank reports for the first 3 weeks of the month
indicate small but contraseasonal increases in loans to producers of
metals and metal products and to textile firms, and larger than seasonal
increases in loans to miscellaneous manufacturing and mining companies.
Loans to construction companies also rose more than seasonally,

III -2
following a relatively weak performance in March. Business loan growth
at these banks, furthermore, continues to be tempered by greater-than-
usual declines in loans to commodity dealers, which had risen contra-
seasonally during the dock strike.

The abrupt decline in the growth of total loans during
April was the main factor in the slower growth of total bank credit.
Bank holdings of Treasury issues fell moderately further, but secur-
ities other than Treasury issues rose sharply in April after showing
little change in March. A significant part of the April increase in
bank holdings of other securities may have come from purchases of two
Federal agency issues, and from delivery of New York State tax antici-
pation notes replacing issues maturing in March.
The March-April increase of $0.8 billion in bank holdings
of non-Treasury securities was about one-half the January-February

III -3
increment, mirroring the slower growth of time deposits in the last
two months. Real estate loans at banks, however; have shown little
discernible relation to the growth of time deposits this year. Bank
acquisitions since December have been slightly smaller than in the
same period of 1964.
Money supply and time deposits. While the April increase in
bank credit was much smaller than in March, on a daily average basis
earning assets rose substantially in April, reflecting the carryover of
the large increase that took place late in March. On the liability
side of the balance sheet, a significant portion of the March to April
increase in average levels took the form of increased Treasury deposits.
The privately-held money stock rose sharply again in April,
however, increasing at an annual rate of 7.5 per cent--with most of the
increase occurring in the first half of the month.. The April data
seem to confirm the view, suggested by the March figures, that the
impact of time deposit rate changes on the demand for money balances
persisted over a shorter time span than had been the case in earlier
periods when ceiling rates under Regulation Q were raised. Increased
transactions demand for money accompanying the brisk rise in GNP ap-
parently has registered its effect in the March and April statistics
on money holdings.
Nevertheless, growth in money holdings since November has not
been large--the annual rates for the period having been 3.5 per cent
for currency, 2.5 per cent for demand balances, and 2.6 per cent for
the total money stock. Turnover of demand balances from November through

III -4
March increased sharply, and a further rise may well have occurred
in April.
Growth in time deposit holdings slackened further to less than
$1 billion in April--below the average monthly increase for 1964 and
substantially lower than the average gains of January and February.
The abatement of total time deposit growth reflects a slower expansion
of both savings accounts and other time deposits, suggesting that the
initial sharp upsurge in bank time deposits which follows a marked
change in time deposit rates is behind us.
Withdrawals of time deposits for payment of individual in-
come tax liabilities may have been larger than seasonal this year,
contributing to the slower growth of time deposits, but this factor
alone could not have accounted for the abrupt slowdown in time deposit
expansion in the past two months. Reports from the city banks, in fact,
indicate that savings deposits declined less in April than they did in
the comparable weeks of last year.
Growth in other time deposits at city banks during April was
about $50 million larger this year than last, due mainly to a greater
increase in CD's. The growth in outstanding CD's in April was prin-
cipally at New York City banks, but Chicago banks and other weekly
reporting members also increased their outstanding moderately. Never-
theless, CD's outstanding at banks outside New York City remained below
the peaks attained earlier this year, when rates quoted on prime CD's
were far enough below regulatory ceilings to give smaller banks elbow
room to price their liabilities attractively.

III -5
Despite the absence of upward pressures on bill rates, CD
rates quoted by prime banks drifted marginally higher during the month--
the most-often-quoted rate on 180-day prime paper was 4-3/8 per cent,
compared with the 4-1/4 per cent level generally prevailing in March.
Rather high dealer positions in CD's late in March may have put some
upward pressure on rates quoted by prime banks. It seems more likely,
however, that the slight stiffening of CD rates was eyidence of an
increased willingness of large banks to bid for CD money (in view of the
underlying strength of business loan demand), and also a reflection of
the tauter reserve position of member banks that prevailed during the
month.
Bank reserves. The increase in average net borrowed reserves
from $50 million in March to about $140 million in April -mainly took
the form of increased member bank borrowings. Excess reserves of
member banks have remained at relatively low levels throughout the
period. If the preliminary estimate of $333 million for April holds,
average excess reserves for the month will be about equal to the lowest
level recorded in any month of recent years. When excess reserves are
this low, it may be that quantities of surplus reserves held by most
individual banks are not sufficient to compensate for efforts to keep
more fully invested, except at very high rates of interest on earning
assets.
The effective rate on Federal funds was at 4-1/8 per cent on
15 of the 22 days from April 1 to April 30, and at 4 per cent on the
remaining 7 trading days.

III -6
U.S-, Government finance. Recent activity in the Treasury
bond market has been dominated by the May refunding whose terms were
announced on April 28. The Treasury is offering two issues in
exchange for $8.4 billion of maturing securities (of which $4.1 billion
are held by the public). The short-term option or anchor issue is
a 15-month, 4 per cent note due in August 1966 and priced to yield
about 4.12 per cent. The longer-term option is a 9-year, 4-1/4
per cent bond due in May 1974 and priced to yield about 4.22 per cent.
Both offerings are reopenings of outstanding issues.
The market considered the pricing of the reopened 4-1/4's
to be more favorable than for the shorter-term option. The former
issue had been in short supply before the financing, and was priced
well below the yield curve at the time of the announcement. Under
these conditions, current market guesses suggest that exchanges into
the 4-1/4's of 1974 could be in the neighborhood of $1.5 billion,
with the dealers apparently willing to take up a sizable amount of
these bonds for later redistribution.
The shorter option in the financing should also prove
attractive to banks, corporations, and other investors who may be
constrained by liquidity considerations from exchanging their maturing
"rights" for the longer-term option. But a potentially inhibiting
consideration in this respect has been the availability of a
somewhat higher rate of return on the latest 1-year bill--converted
to a bond or investment yield basis from a discount basis--than on
the 15-month anchor issue in the refunding. In the first few days

III -7
after the announcement, however, dealers reported relatively light
amounts of demand for bills from sellers of rights to the May refunding.

Treasury bill rates have been edging downward recently despite
continued pressure on bank reserve positions. In late April and early
May, the key 3-month bill traded around the 3.90 per cent level, down
4 or 5 basis points from mid-April. Strong seasonal purchases of
bills by public funds, improved demand from corporations, and stock-
piling of bills by dealers in anticipation of demand from sellers of
rights helped to maintain downward pressure on rates. In addition, in
late April and early May there were market purchases by Treasury
investment accounts and by System account totalling about $650 million.
Under these conditions, the average issuing rates for 3- and 6-month
bills in the first weekly auction in May dropped to their lowest
levels since mid-winter--with thq 3-month bill going at 3.90 per cent
and the 6-month bill at 3.95 per cent. Other short-term rates,
however, have remained generally firm in the recent period; these
have included rates on secondary market certificates of deposit,

III -8
commercial and finance company paper, and bankers' acceptances as
well as rates on Federal funds and dealer loans.
In the period after the Treasury refunding was announced,
the decline in bill rates, together with some fading of the premium
on the "rights", increased the attractiveness of the short 15-month
option and thereby lessened the likely amount of attrition in the
financing. While a large attrition may have brought the market to
question the sustainability of current interest rate levels, at least
in the shorter-term coupon area, it would not have found the Treasury
short of cash.
The Treasury's cash balance has been running above
projections for some weeks now. It was augmented in April by higher
than expected individual income tax receipts.!/ This, together with
a continued holding of the line on expenditures, has brought the
cash operating balance at the end of April to $8 billion, as compared
with $5 billion a year ago. Assuming a minimum attrition in the
current financing and no new cash raised in May and June, the Treasury
may be expected to close the fiscal year with a balance somewhat
above $10.5 billion, even after paying off $3.3 billion of tax bills
that mature in mid-June.
1/ It is too early to tell how much of the enlarged April income tax
receipts represent greater payments on the 1964 liability (either
because the forecast of underwithholding was too small or because
the liability, including capital gain taxes, was larger than
expected) and how much are initial payments on estimated 1965
taxes. This information will not be available for two months.

III -9
Corporate and municipal bond markets, Investors in corporate
and State and local government securities have cohtinued to press for
some yield improvement in recent weeks, and the generally cautious
tone in evidence in bond markets since late March has persisted.
Yields on corporate bonds--new issues as well as seasoned--have
advanced to levels barely below their 1965 highs; but published yield
series on municipals have remained relatively stable.

Hesitancy on the part of investors produced a substantial
inventory build-up among corporate underwriters around mid-April, with
six newt issues in syndicate at the same time. Syndicate restrictions
on three of these issues were subsequently terminated--with unsold
balances still large--and their yields advanced 2-5 basis points in
the secondary market. Dealers have since tended to back off a bit
in their bidding for new competitive offerings; at the more liberal
yields resulting, investor interest has improved.

III -10
In the municipal market, most new issues offered prior to
the last week in April were reported as poorly received. As the month
progressed, dealers began to make price concessions to move some
older issues out of inventory, and late in the month new offerings
were reportedly also being priced below similar issues offered earlier.
While these adjustments have not been reflected in the published yield
series--which tend to lag the market--they have apparently affected
investor demands. As April closed, underwriters were experiencing
greater success in selling tax exempts.

In May public offerings of corporate bonds are expected to
swell to the largest monthly total since April 1962, nearly two-fifths
above May volume a year ago. Utility bonds scheduled for competitive
bidding account for $300 million of this total--the largest monthly
volume of such issues in over a year.
While the flow of new municipal bonds to market was quite
light throughout most of April, an unexpectedly large supply in the
final week expanded volume for the entire month almost to the March

III -11
level. Early in the month, sales of older issues at slightly reduced
prices were sufficient to compensate for slow sales of new offerings,
so that over-all dealers' inventories of unsold issues--although
remaining unusually high--did not exceed the record $800 million plus
mark reached temporarily in March. Recently, inventories have edged
up to more than $800 million again under pressure from heavy new issue
volume, but a combination of improved sales of new issues and some
liquidation of older inventories has continued to keep dealers' stocks
below their earlier high, Since the supply of new municipal bonds
estimated for May is also large, the tone of the market remains
cautious, as participants wait to see how much of the continuing
supply will be absorbed by commercial banks.
Stock market. After fluctuating within a narrow range for
two months, common stock prices advanced sharply during the past
month to an all-time high. Standard and Poor's composite index closed
at 09.51 on May 4, 4 per cent above the late iiarch level and
more than 2 per cent above the previous high reached at the start
of February. Among other things the further advance of stock prices
has reflected first quarter earnings reports even better than many
had expected, cessation of earlier selling pressure arising from
the need to pay April income taxes, and the postponement of the
deadline for a steel settlement until September 1. Trading volume
averaged 5.7 million shares a day in April, with volume rising as
prices advanced.

III -12
Corporate profits. Published reports now available for
larger companies indicate a sharp first quarter rise in corporate
earnings to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of profits before taxes
in the neighborhood of $62.5 billion. While this total is above the
$61 billion first quarter figure contained in the recent Board staff
projection, it is consistent with that figure when allowance is made
for the revision in GNP and fourth quarter profits that occurred after
the projection was made. The revised fourth quarter profits total
was $57.4 billion, and the comparable figure for the first quarter
of 1964 was $56.6 billion.
Manufacturing industries accounted for most of the first
quarter rise in corporate earnings this year. Data now available for
about 750 companies suggest that aggregate profits after taxes of
manufacturers were nearly 20 per cent larger in the first quarter
than a year ago. Earnings this year were bolstered by recovery in
auto production and by efforts of business to build steel inventories,
but the risein profits was not restricted to these indu tries;
year-to-year increases occurred in every major manufacturing industry.
After-tax profits were also pushed up by the second half of the 4
point reduction in Federal incore tax rates, but in almost every
manufacturing industry the rise in profits was larger than could be
attributable to the tax cut alone.
Mortgage markets. lhile mortgage lenders have remained
somewhat more selective, competition for loans to qualified borrowers
has continued active this spring. A recent survey by the National
Association of Real Estate Boards of its panel of realtors underscored

III -13
the availability of home-mortgage funds. Lenders also reported further
increases in their forward mortgage lending commitments during the
early months of the year, and recent Home Loan Bank data on average
nonrate terms for home loans confirm the continuance of a borrower's
market. Interest rates on home mortgage loans have remained unchanged.
Notwithstanding the continued availability offunds, the
first quarter increase in mortgage debt was apparently no larger than the
record growth for the same period a year earlier. The rate of expansion
in home-mortgage debt was the smallest for the first quarter in three
years. But debt secured by multi-family and commercial properties
increased more than in the first quarter a year ago, and farm mortgage
debt continued to grow at about the same advanced rate as a year earlier.

First quarter expansion in the mortgage portfolios of
major private lenders as a group was about the same or a little less
than in the comparable periods of 1964 and 1963. Only life insurance
companies continued to report substantial year-over-year increases
in the net amount of takings. Savings and loan associations experienced
the smallest expansion in mortgage holdings since early 1961, accounting
for only a little over three-tenths of the total rise in debt during
the first quarter. However, they maintained their recently increased
share of debt expansion on apartments and other non-home properties.
Net acquisitions of commercial banks also grew less rapidly than a
year ago while acquisitions of mutual savings banks held about even.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
U.S. balance of payments. Latest data confirm earlier estimates
of a first quarter payments deficit on regular transactions of about $300
million. On a seasonally adjusted basis, the deficit will probably be
shown as about $750 million, or $3 billion at an annual rate, when it
is released later this month. Seasonal adjustments to the payments data
are currently undergoing substantial revision by the Commerce Department,
and the $750 million figure incorporates the tentative new (and higher)
adjustment for the first quarter.
The payments surplus which appeared in March continued into
April. However, partial weekly data suggest that deficits reappeared
later in the month, and for the month as a whole the surplus will probably
be less than half the size of the $500 million March surplus. The change
in the over-all balance from March to April was partly accounted for by
seasonal factors. Further gold sales in April brought the total reduction
in U.S. gold holdings since the beginning of the year to almost $1 billion.
As compared with the fourth quarter of 1964, the deficit in
the first quarter was reduced by one-half. From the fragmentary data
now available on payments transactions, it would appear that the bulk
of the reduction resulted from lower net outflows of U.S. private capital.
Outflows of long-term bank credit to foreigners, as expected,
were fairly small in March. Preliminary totals for the month show an
outflow of only $40 million, as compared with outflows of about $230
million in both January and February. For the quarter as a whole, how-
ever, the seasonally adjusted outflow amounted to more than $500 million,
up $200 million from the fourth quarter.

IV -2
Outflows of U.S. short-term capital reported by banks totaled
$100 million in March, a little smaller than in February. However, the
large inflow that occurred in January reduced the net movement for the
quarter almost to zero, or to a small net outflow on a seasonally
adjusted basis. In the fourth quarter of last year, these outflows had
totaled nearly $450 million, seasonally adjusted. In addition to the
reduction in outflows of bank-reported claims on foreigners, reports and
some indirect evidence suggest a net inflow of funds from abroad by U.S.
nonfinancial concerns.
U.S.purchases of new foreign security issues in the first
quarter totaled about $300 million after seasonal adjustment. These
purchases had been almost twice as large in the last three months of
1964. Also, sales of foreign stocks by U.S. holders to foreigners increased.
The changes in these capital flows account fairly well for the
improvement in the over-all balance between the fourth and the first
quarters. It would appear that the flow of net receipts from trade
was well maintained in the first quarter as a whole, despite the
disruptions to the physical movements of exports and imports caused by
the dock strike. In the balance of payments accounts, a sharp reduction
in the recorded trade surplus will be shown, but there will probably
also be large receipts on unrecorded transactions.
The latest trade figures continue to mirror efforts to move
strike-delayed shipments. Imports began to catch up in February. In
March, the first full month following the end of the strike, they jumped
further by 17 per cent, seasonally adjusted. No data have yet been

IV -3
released on exports in March, but it is thought thalt they will show a
rise of well over 50 per cent from the still depressed February rate.
From these irregular data, it is still not possible to judge
how well the export surplus is holding up, apart from strike effects.
One factor tending to raise imports, and which was already apparent in
the fourth quarter, is increased purchases of foreign steel in anticipa-
tion of a steel strike. Industry reports claim that steel imports are
currently averaging 1 million tons a month, which would be about double
the monthly import rate for 1964. Such a rise would be smaller pro-
portionately than that which occurred around the time of the 1959 strike,
but larger than the increase occurring in similar circumstances in 1962
and 1963. A rise of this magnitude in steel imports would add approxi-
mately $65 million per month -- or 4 per cent -- to the value of total
imports. In the past, much of the steel ordered from abroad in anticipa-
tion of a steel strike has not arrived until after the strike has begun
or after a settlement has been reached.
New orders for exports of durable goods, other than motor
vehicles, recovered in February from a sharp dip in January, according
to revised data. The February rise represented mainly an increase in
aircraft orders. For other durables, export orders appear to have fallen
off, with the December-February average 7 per cent below the average for
the preceding three months and down 4 per cent from the corresponding
period a year earlier.

IV -4
Economic activity in Western Europe. Expansion of over-all
activity in Europe has continued to be somewhat faster than during the
mid-1964 pause, but below the rapid rate of early 1964.
During the past year or so, three countries -- Italy, France
and Belgium -- have experienced a slowing of growth in response to govern-
ment stabilization measures. Italy, in fact, went through a recession
of significant dimensions, from which recovery started last fall. The
EEC Commission at the end of March suggested that the internal situation
in these countries was such that further restraint was no longer necessary,
and that a cautious reversal of restrictive policies, despite continuing
upward cost trends, is indicated.
In contrast, the authorities of Germany, the Netherlands, the
Scandinavian countries, Switzerland and the United Kingdom consider that
the growth of demand in their countries is outrunning,or threatens to
outrun, the growth of domestic resources, and are continuing their anti-
inflationary efforts.
In France a downturn in economic activity -- the first since
1958 -- became distinctly evident after September 1964. However, the
decline was not prolonged. Apart from effects of work stoppages in
the public sector in December and January, industrial output was about
stable from December through February. The latest Government survey of
industry found that producers expect their output during the next three
or four months to rise rather than decline.
Since mid-1964 unemployment has been rising and working hours
have been steadily reduced. In March unemployment was 22 per cent above
the preceding year's low level. While these developments have affected

V -5
consumer demand adversely, the general freeze on factory prices imposed
in September, 1963 (helping to slow retail price increases considerably)
has apparently allowed real wages to rise faster than in 1963. Consumer
prices remained stable during the last three months of 1964, and the 0.6
per cent increase registered in January was due primarily to seasonal
increases in food prices and an increase in rents. In February, consumer
prices rose only fractionally.
This relative stability of prices, combined with advances in
money wages -- which, though slower than before, are still continuing --
allegedly has produced a profit squeeze which is impairing business in-
centive and capacity to invest. The INSEE quarterly survey of the French
economy, based on February data, foresees a fall of 5 or 6 per cent in
investment in the manufacturing sector in 1965 as compared with 1964.
The year-to-year increase in investment in mining, construction, agri-
culture, various "tertiary" activities, and petroleum is to slow down --
from 11 or 12 per cent in 1964 to only 5 or 6 per cent in 1965. But the
survey concluded that there may be a possibility of a general upturn in
the fall.
Under these conditions, the authorities have been under pressure
to relax their fiscal and monetary restraints. So far, they have been
willing to do so only in a limited way. Since last summer, money market
conditions have been smoothed, and on the average eased somewhat, through
intermittent temporary reductions in the banks' liquid assets reserve
requirement. On April 8 the Bank of France reduced its discount rate by

IV -6
half a per cent; the effect of this action is mainly psychological since
no reduction was made in the ceilings on bank credit expansion. On the
fiscal side, the authorities recently acted to stimulate private invest-
ment by a sharp reduction in the tax rate on dividends.
These moves toward a policy of less restraint have been
facilitated by the continuing improvement in France's foreign trade
position and a further substantial rise in her official reserves. (See
Appendix B on France's External Position, 1959-65.) Exports in February
(after a temporary fall in January) were close to the year-end high,
while imports in January-February were about 4 per cent below the last
quarter of 1964.
Official reserves increased by a considerable amount -- $232
million -- during the first quarterof 1965. To some extent the gain
reflected private withdrawals of funds from Britain. During the latter
half of April reserves remained virtually unchanged.
In Italy, recovery from recession is continuing, though the
outlook for the building industry remains bleak. The wage-price spiral
continues to be a cause of concern.
Industrial production in January was up 4 per cent from the
third quarter. Details available through December show that output of
investment goods rose from its third-quarter level, after declining
steadily earlier in 1964. The decline in consumer goods output
continued, but at a much slower pace. The movements of imports also
suggested an upturn in aggregate demand. While monthly changes have
been erratic, from October through January imports averaged 4 per
cent above the third quarter.

IV -7
These developments have led the Banca Nazionale del Lavoro
declare "... that a feeling of confidence is being gradually restored."
Helping to improve business confidence was the public spending program
announced in mid-March which, among other things, shifted a part of con-
tribution toward social security from employers to the government.
Two trouble spots remaining are the weakness in the building
sector and the continuing upward trend of wages and prices. Wholesale
prices rose only 1.3 per cent in the twelve months to January, but con-
sumer prices -- which are particularly important because wages in major
Italian industries are linked to the consumer price index -- were con-
tinuing to rise in January at an annual rate of about 5.5 per cent. Wage
rates in manufacturing, reflecting both the sliding scale and contractual
agreements, averaged about 13 per cent higher in 1964 than in 1963, and
expectations are for further increases in 1965.
Italy's balance of payments, which swung back into surplus with
last year's decline in imports and rise in capital inflow, has not been
visibly affected as yet by the continuing cost pressures nor by the easing
of credit since last summer. In the first quarter of 1965 -- seasonally
the poorestquarter of the year for the balance of payments -- the payments
surplus was about $75 million, and a substantial surplus is indicated
for April.
In Germany, economic activity has continued to expand. Produc-
tivity gains have allowed further increases in output despite acute labor
shortages.
Industrial production in January-February was 4 per cent above its
average in the last quarter of 1964. New orders remained at their very high
November-December 1964 level, and order backlogs reportedly lengthened.

IV -8
Further growth of German imports is helping to moderate the
impact of rising demand upon the domestic economy. First-quarter imports
were up by about one-fourth from a year earlier. However, renewed
growth of exports since last August is resulting in a new rise in the
German trade balance. The first quarter trade surplus, at $295 million,
was well above the $113 million registered in the last quarter of 1964,
though less than half as large as in the first quarter of 1964.
With demand continuing to expand in all major sectors, upward
pressure on prices is also continuing. In the investments goods sector,
price advances have accelerated since last summer. The Bundesbank has
continued to pursue a policy of restraint, and in April it reduced the
rediscount quotas of the banks by 20-25 per cent, to take effect next
autumn. The impact of this particular move may be mainly psychological,
since total rediscountable assets under the new quotas are estimated
to amount to about DM 12-15 billion whereas outstanding rediscounts are
now only DM 3.6 billion.
Great Britain. The continuing concern in the United Kingdom
is how to balance external requirements -- among which restoration of
confidence in the pound is the most pressing -- and domestic growth.
Current trends in output are obscure. The index of industrial
production, which had remained stable during the first nine months of
1964, rose by 4 per cent between September and December 1964 and moved
up slightly further in January, but slipped back to the December level
in February. The labor situation remains very tight. Unemployment in
April was down to 1.5 per cent of the labor force, the lowest April

IV -9
level in four years, and the number of unfilled job vacancies (after
seasonal adjustment) rose to the highest level since September 1955.
Pressures of demand are reflected in the continuing rise in
wages and prices; from December to March retail and whole prices and
wage rate all rose at annual rates of about 4 per cent. Future success
of the Government's incomes policy is imperilled by recent wage increases
in the public sector, such as the very large award (amounting to 20 per
cent over a two-year period) granted to postal workers a few days after
the guidelines of 3 to 3-1/2 per cent were published; and also by the
repudiation of the incomes policy by the Transport and General Workers'
Union on April 30. Previously, a quickening in the pace of price in-
creases in advance of the start of activity of the new Prices and Incomes
Court had been reported.
In foreign trade, some improvement occurred in the first quarter.
Despite a disappointing January, exports during the quarter were 1-1/2 per
cent higher and imports 4 per cent lower than in the preceding three
months. The trade deficit was reduced from its monthly average of £95
million during 1964 to £62 million in the first quarter of 1965. The
reduction in the import surcharge effective at the end of April is expected
to produce a bunching of import arrivals in May.
In view of renewed expansion of bank loans in March and April,
the Bank of England on April 29 moved to reduce bank liquidity by calling
special deposits by the clearing banks amounting to 1 per cent of their
gross deposits. The requirement becomes effective in two stages, at
mid-May and at mid-June. At mid-April, the clearing banks' liquidity ratio
had been above the 28 per cent conventional minimum by 1.5 percentage points.

IV -10
Economic activity in Japan. After a peak reached last October,
industrial production declined about 2 per cent in the following months
through March of this year (preliminary). High levels of inventories
may have been inhibiting a rise in production. Producers' inventories
of finished goods continued their general rise through January of this
year, but fell very slightly in February. Inventories of imported raw
materials have declined moderately in recent months, but materials in-
ventories in total have been relatively stable at a high level.
The trade balance improved sharply further in March as exports,
seasonally adjusted, rose 3 per cent and imports fell 5 per cent. Part
of this decline in imports, however, may have been due to reduced shipments
from the U.S. during the January-February dock strike. International
reserves rose $3 million in March and in April fell $34 million, to a
level of $2,019 million. Part of the decline in April can be attributed,
according to Japanese sources, to developments affecting capital flows,
including the maturing of a large volume of import bills, the drying up
of working capital loans from abroad, and a relatively low volume of
Japanese bond issues abroad during the month.

APPENDIX A: EASTER AND RETAIL SALES
Strength in retail sales so far this year is indicated by
their substantial margin of gain from a year ago, which was evident
early this year and continued through the pre-Easter period. In the
eight or so weeks prior to Easter Sunday this year retail sales
exhibited roughly the same pattern of general but uneven rise they
have in each of the three preceding years. The recent course of total
sales is shown weekly in the upper chart on the following page. The
figures plotted are unadjusted for seasonal variations. They cover
the ten weeks before and four weeks after Easter (one week after for
1965) with Easter of each year from 1962 as the reference point.
The effect of Easter on retail sales is even more clearly
evident when sales of the automotive group are excluded from the
total, as in the lower chart. Sales of automobiles are large in
dollar amount and are not greatly influenced by Easter.

APPENDIX B: FRANCE'S EXTERNAL POSITION, 1959-1965
Since 1963, French officials have been proposing fundamental
changes in the international payments system under which surplus coun-
tries would automatically receive gold in settlement of all (or most)
of their surpluses. This official French attitude is shaped in part by
the continuing strength of the French balance of payments. Over the
last six years, France has had the largest surpluses of any country in
Europe. Although the French surplus has been reduced from its record
high of $1.3 billion (before debt prepayments) in 1961, it was still
nearly $800 million in 1964.
The French surplus is expected to be large again in 1965.
Consequently, France will continue to be in a position to demand large
amounts of gold. The French authorities stated early in January 1965
that they would in fact convert into gold all of their future dollar
earnings, irrespective of any changes in world payments arrangements,
and since last February they have been buying gold in amounts equal
each month to the previous month's dollar accruals. (In addition, in
January and March they also bought a total of $300 million of gold with
dollars accumulated in prior years.)
Surpluses began in 1959. In 1958, France redressed her
internal finances and, in the closing days of 1958, devalued the franc
for the second time in two years. Thereafter, over the six years
1959-64, France had a cumulative balance of payments surplus of 4.5
billion dollars, even after making almost $1.4 billion of advance pay-
ments on debts owed to the United States, Canada, and the IBRD, as well
as to various European creditors on debts contracted under the European
Payments Union.
France has experienced external surpluses despite rapid
internal growth over most of this period. GNP at constant prices rose
at an average annual rate of about 5 per cent in 1959-64. Capital for-
mation has equalled 20 per cent of gross national expenditure, Common
Market internal tariff cuts have provided powerful incentives to
efficiency, and the government has attempted to stimulate growth by
national economic planning. Yet the continuing surpluses cannot be
traced to a good record on internal price stability. The 12 per cent
rise in French wholesale prices from 1959 to 1964 exceeded the in-
creases which occurred in the United States and in other major European
countries.
There are several reasons for the continuing strength of the
French balance of payments. In the first place, the two devaluations
of 1957 and 1958 (totaling almost 30 per cent) led in the next few years
to exceptionally large surpluses on current account, which attained a
peak of $953 million in 1961. From 1962 to 1964, inflationary pressures

helped to reduce the current surplus very sharply, but because it was
so large to begin with, the current account could deteriorate greatly
without shifting into a deficit. For 1964, preliminary estimates show
a current surplus of $87 million. Furthermore, the deterioration in
the trade balance was halted during 1964.
Large capital inflows have been a continuing feature. Large
and growing capital inflows have been a second major cause of the
external strength of the franc. Foreign investment in Metropolitan
France averaged about $400 million yearly in 1959-60, increased to
$500 million per year in 1962-63, and is provisionally estimated at
$585 million in 1964. Direct investment has been the largest single
component of those totals, but security purchases and loans have also
figured prominently. U.S. investment in France in the years 1960 to
1963 averaged about $125 million per year.
After confidence in the franc was restored by the financial
measures taken in 1958, French residents repatriated capital on a large
scale in 1959. Net outflows of French capital in subsequent years,
averaging $140 million annually, have been much smaller than the foreign
capital inflows.
The French balance of payments does not include the foreign
aid extended by the French government to the former colonies that are
part of the franc area, and this aid accounts for around 90 per cent of
total French aid. Although net public grants and capital outpayments
to other areas (excluding debt prepayments) averaged $146 million
annually in 1962-64, about one-half comprised scheduled payments on
France's foreign debts, and not all of the remainder was aid. Con-
versely, the overseas franc area has been gaining substantial amounts
of foreign exchange, which it transfers to France in exchange for French
francs; these accruals rose sharply to $260 million (preliminary) in
1964.
Finally, the balance on government payments for services (a
part of the current account) has been favorable for France. In 1964,
the French government spent $197 million abroad (outside the franc area)
whereas foreign governments spent $266 million in France. Over the six
years 1959-64, the excess of foreign government expenditures in France
over French government expenditures abroad averaged $73 million per year.
Trade balance deterioration was arrested in 1964. The decline
in the current account surplus from $953 million in 1961 to only $87
million in 1964 reflected both a decline in the surplus on private
services and an even greater adverse swing in the trade balance from a
$501 million surplus (payments basis) in 1961 to a $113 million deficit
in 1964. But the trade balance deterioration was arrested in 1964.
The French authorities took strong anti-inflationary measures in 1963
which led in the following year to a decided slowing of price increases;

in fact, wholesale prices rose hardly at all last year. Industrial
production levelled off in the second quarter of 1964 and tended slightly
downward from September to January of this year. Imports (seasonally
adjusted) rose only very slightly during 1964, while exports continued
to expand, and the trade balance improved. This improvement is reflected
in the year-to-year comparisons of the (unadjusted) quarterly balance of
payments trade figures; these comparisons were much more favorable for
the last half of 1964 than for the first half.

Outlook for 1965. In 1965, the French surplus may recede
from the $776 million level of 1964, especially if economic activity
resumes its upward trend and brings forth a rise in imports. The pay-
ments balance was also improved in 1964 and the first quarter of 1965
by the speculation against sterling, and a reverse movement of short-
term funds may occur. Furthermore, French officials believe that the
private services account will continue to change unfavorably. But
with such a strong base to start out with, in all likelihood France
will record another very large surplus. Official reserves have in-
creased $211 million in the first three months of this year.
France's official gross reserves of gold and convertible
currencies increased by $4,055 million from the end of 1958 to the end
of 1964, an amount not much less than the cumulative balance of payments

surpluses (after debt prepayments) which totalled $4,535 million. The
official reserve gains were held down by $895 million of transactions
with the IMF comprising repayments of drawings made by France prior to
1959, drawings of French francs by other countries, and the gold sub-
scription for a quota increase; and also by substantial repayments made
in 1959 on short-term official debts. But the effect of these trans-
actions on the official reserves was in large part offset by a $771
million increase in the net foreign liabilities of the commercial banks
in France. Official reserves, following the further increase in the
first quarter of 1965, totalled $5,316 million on March 31.

The gold portion of the official reserves generally fluctuated
between 70 and 75 per cent in 1959-64, a proportion that was lower than
for several other major countries including the United Kingdom, Switzerland,
the Netherlands and Belgium. However, French gold purchases in the first
three months of 1965 raised the gold ratio to 79 per cent at the end of
March. The gold ratio will rise gradually in the future if France continues
the policy begun this year of regularly converting into gold all of the
fresh accruals of dollars during the preceding month. At present, French
dollar holdings amount to about $1.1 billion, and these could also be con-
verted into gold. However, French officials have indicated that they will
not be so used in any large degree because France still owes $660 million
of official debts to the United States and Canada and desires to keep a
dollar working balance of roughly $400 million.
