of Governors of the Federal Reserve Syst em.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization proce ss which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain. 
 Please note that some material may have b een redacted from this document if that

tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing).

IN BROAD REVIEW
Expansion in domestic economic activity has slowed from the
very rapid pace of the winter. While a slow-down had been generally
anticipated, its appearance nonetheless has tended to cause some
reexamination of optimistic predictions for the remainder of the year.
Any examination must start from the interim settlement of the steel
labor situation and the consequent easing of demand tension in that
industry. Steel output declined 5 per cent in the 3 weeks following
this settlement.
In April the increase in industrial production was smell,
retail sales drifted down further, and the labor market barely held
its own. On the other hand, new and unfilled orders for durable goods
rose in April, with defense orders up very sharply. The number of
housing starts remained at the improved March level. As reported
earlier, business plans for spending on fixed capital have been stepped
up.
Industrial commodity prices at wholesale continued to move
up very slightly through mid-May but prices of farm products and
foodstuffs have increased appreciably. Unit labor costs in manu-
facturing in April continued to edge lower.
Total bank credit expansion has been less sharp than in the
first quarter, although the demand for bank loans continues very
strong. In capital markets, dealer inventories of unsold issues are
high reflecting heavy financing, but thus far upward pressure on bond
yields has remained moderate. In the money markets, Treasury bill
rates have remained around their recent lows. The money supply, which

I -2
increased rapidly in March and April, dropped sharply in the first half
of May. Time deposit growth has continued at the reduced March-April
rate.
The Federal fiscal position has strengthened with receipts
larger than expected earlier and expenditures under some restraint.
The cash deficit for fiscal 1965 is now estimated at only $2 billion as
compared with $4 billion projected in January. For calendar 1965,
a similar cutback in the deficit is now indicated. Excise cuts proposed
this week by the President are more than double the amount indicated
in the Budget Message. The bulk of the cuts would take effect in two
approximately equal stages--on July 1, 1965, and January 1, 1966.
The U. S. balance of payments was in surplus in April, as
in March. Without adjustment for seasonal influences, which are less
favorable in April than March, the surplus was $160 million. Data
are not available on bank credit outflow in April. The net outflow
of long-term bank credit in March was sharply reduced from earlier
levels, but there was still a considerable net outflow of short-term
bank credit, including in particular acceptance credits to Japan.
Industrial production in Europe advanced further in the
first quarter of 1965, following a 2-1/2 per cent rise from the
third to the fourth quarter of 1964. Despite resource limitations,
German production continued to rise. In Italy, recovery from
recession gained further ground.

THE DOMESTIC ECONOMY
Industrial production. The preliminary index of industrial
production in April was 140.8 per cent, up slightly from the revised
level of 140.5 in March, and 8 per cent above a year earlier. In
contrast, the index had increased an average of one point a month
from September to March. Over-all output of consumer goods was
maintained in April despite a decline in auto assemblies. Production
of trucks increased to a record high and activity in other equipment
industries remained at advanced levels. Production of nondurable
materials increased somewhat.
Auto assemblies declined in April to a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of 9.4 million units from the record March rate of nearly
10 million. Assemblies are scheduled at about a 9.5 million rate in
May and June. Output of television sets, some other household goods,
and consumer staples increased somewhat further in April. Among
materials, output of industrial chemicals continued to rise and out-
put of metal and glass containers recovered from strike reduced
levels. Production and shipments of steel increased further, but
then steel ingot production declined 5 per cent over the 3 weeks
following the April 26 announcement of the extension of the labor
contract.
Gross national product. Gross national product ilcreased
$14 billion in the first quarter to an annual rate of $649 billion.
This estimate differs little in total from the advance estimate

II -2
published a month ago. The total was $40 billion, or 6.6 per cent,
higher than a year earlier. In constant prices, it was up 4.8
per cent, well above the 1957-64 average growth rate of about 3.5
per cent. The unusually large rise in the first quarter reflected
exceptional increases in both personal consumption expenditures and
gross private domestic investment. (For details, see Table I -- T-2.)
Consumer income and spending. Personal income edged up in
April to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $514.5 billion, 5.7 per
cent higher than a year earlier. The April advance was one of the
smallest in two years. Wage and salary payments in manufacturing de-
clined $500 million because of a cutback in average hours of work per
week, while payroll increases in other private activities were small.
State and local government payrolls showed their usual rise. Other
types of personal income increased slightly or were unchanged.
Total retail sales in April were off slightly from the reduced
March level and 2.2 per cent from the February peak, according to the
advance report. Durable goods sales were down 1.5 per cent from March
and 4.4 per cent from the February high. Sales at nondurable goods
outlets remained virtually unchanged in April from their slightly
reduced March level.

* Based on Commerce advance figures for April.
In the first third of May, deliveries of new domestic autos
rose contraseasonally above a month earlier and were 17 per cent
above a year ago. A contest among Chevrolet dealers, which began
May 1, apparently induced some postponement of deliveries from the
last third of April, when deliveries dropped to the level of a year
ago. This decline brought the annual rate for April down to 8.2 million.
Present indications are that sales in May will be at the April rate
or a little higher, and well below the peak 9.6 million rate of January
and February.
Stocks of new cars were up slightly on May 10 from a month
earlier and represented 45 days' supply at the current daily sales
rate. This is about equal to the average for this season in other
recent years.
Used car sales in the first period of May were down modestly
from a month earlier, although they usually rise in this period. Used
car prices have eased somewhat since early this year.

II -4
Orders for durable goods. Seasonally adjusted new orders
for durable goods increased 2 per cent further in April, with the rise
reflecting primarily a sharp upturn in defense ordering. For all
civilian products combined new orders were down slightly because of
a decline from the pronounced March peak in the auto industry and some
further slackening in ordering of steel. New orders for machinery
and equipment expanded further.

Sales of durable goods declined moderately from the record
March level as sales by the auto and aircraft industries decreased.
Steel shipments showed a sizable further increase.
Unfilled orders increased again in April after showing no
change in Hiarch. The order backlog spurted in defense industries
and continued to expand in the machinery and equipment sector, while
unfilled orders for steel declined considerably further.
Labor market. The labor market eased somewhat in April
following the substantial gains reported in the first three months of

II -5
this year. Nonfarm employment did not advance above the Iarch level
and hours of work declined. Unemployment rose slightly under the
increased pressure of the growing supply of young people entering the
labor force. This pressure will mount even further by midsummer.
The small decline in April in nonfarm employment was partly
due to unusually bad weather in the Midwest during the survey week,
which depressed employment in construction and retail trade. However,
there were fairly widespread indications of a general slowing down in
employment gains. Only State and local government employment continued
to show its earlier strength.

Employment in manufacturing rose by 36,000, to a total of
17.9 million in April; the increase was much smaller than earlier and
about two-thirds was accounted for by settlement of the can strike.
In the auto, nonelectrical and electrical machinery industries, employ-
ment continued to show further advances, but in most other industries
changes were quite small.
Despite the leveling off in April, nonfarm employment was
still about 2.1 million above the level of a year earlier. Manufacturing
accounted for 665,000 or almost one-third of the year-over-year rise.
Retail trade added about one-half million workers; services and State
and local government also reported sharp increases.
Younger workers entered the labor force in larger than
seasonally expected numbers in April causing the overall unemployment
rate to rise to 4.9 per cent from 4.7 per cent in the previous month;
a year ago, the rate was 5.4 per cent. Usually the influx of summer
workers and graduates into the job market does not go into high gear
until May and June. The participation rate for young workers was
extremely low in the first quarter and there may have been some sta-
tistical catching-up in April. Almost the entire increase in the
labor force in April was concentrated among people 14-24 years of age.
There were 350,000 more teenagers in the labor force than in April 1964;
in contrast, in the first quarter the margin was only 100,000. The
differential year-over-year increase should widen to about 600,000 by
midsummer and add further pressure on the unemployment rate for youths.

II -7
For teenagers the unemployment rate rose to 15.2 per cent
in April from 13.9 per cent in the previous month, and for youths
20-24 years of age, the rate went up to 7.1 from 6.3 per cent. For
other groups the changes were mainly seasonal. Unemployment for adult
workers in April remained at the relatively low rates of recent months--
for married men it was 2.5 per cent, a rate which has changed little
since last November.
Hours and labor costs. The seasonally adjusted workweek in
manufacturing declined 0.6 hours in April to 40.8 hours. While observance
of religious holidays during the reporting week appears to have been
responsible for some of the decline, it seems likely that the May
workweek will continue to be below the first quarter record levels.
The workweek declined in April by more than an hour in the machinery,
transportation equipment, and rubber industries. Slightly less sharp
were the reductions in electrical equipment and apparel.
A new seasonally adjusted series showed average weekly overtime
hours in April down to 3.2 from 3.3 in larch. Because of cutbacks in
premium pay for overtime work in many high wage durable goods industries,
average hourly earnings in manufacturing as a whole, seasonally adjusted,
declined 1 cent to $2.59, an amount 2.8 per cent above a year ago.
Weekly earnings also declined somewhat in April to $105.67, which was
3 per cent above a year earlier.
With both earnings and manhours of work in manufacturing
below the March level and with output up slightly further, unit labor
costs declined in April. The index of unit labor costs, at 96.8,

II -8
was below a year ago and was at the lowest level reported for the month
in a number of years.
Prices. The industrial commodity price index increased
.1 per cent from mid-March to mid-April, and the weekly estimates
indicate a further .1 per cent rise to mid-May. At 101.8 per cent of
the 1957-59 average, the estimated index for lay was up 1 per cent
from a year ago and fractionally above the peak reached early in 1960.
The recent increases have continued to be concentrated among metals
and machinery, and an index for all other industrial commodities has
changed little.
IIajor aluminum producers, in response to sharply increased
demands, have advanced selling prices of semifabricated shapes by 9
per cent. These products, accounting for about 25 per cent of total
mill shipments, are used in items such as doors, windows, and auto
trim. Chronic excess capacity in recent years has caused considerable
price discounting, and the new prices are still almost a fifth below
nominal lists.
Zinc remains in very short supply and domestic stocks are
approaching low levels of the Korean Uar period. But the opening of
new mines and the reopening of old ones closed because of past low
prices is proceeding. Since the steel and auto industries each account
for one-third of U.S. zinc consumption, easing of some of the recent
pressures may occur when steel and auto output declines.
Tin prices continue to fluctuate at advanced levels not far
from last autumn's peak, Stockpiling of tinplate by U,S. container

II -9
manufacturers has been an important factor in the demand for tin.
Domestic copper and brass fabricators have increased prices to reflect
the new world copper price of 36 cents a pound. Unfilled orders for
copper and copper products continue to rise, and a recent stockpile
release was oversubscribed by three times. But barring further supply
disruptions, industry executives expect supplies and demands to come
into balance by the end of the year.
Some smaller steel firms have advanced prices on an important
tin plate product. Increases of up to 2-1/2 per cent have been
announced by major tire manufacturers, but reports indicate that these
increases may not stick.
Wholesale prices of foodstuffs have continued to increase
in recent weeks and are about 5 per cent higher than a year ago. As
a result of reduced marketings, hog prices this year have risen to
the highest levels since mid-1958. Unusual weather in many parts
of the country has hampered the harvesting of fresh fruits and
vegetables. Reflecting mainly the rise in foodstuffs, the total
wholesale price index so far this year has increased about 1 per cent.
Farm income. Net realized income of farm operators in
the first quarter was $12.4 billion dollars (seasonally adjusted
annual rate), a little below a year earlier largely because of the con-
tinued edging upward of costs of production. Cash receipts from sales
of farm products were about the same as a year earlier and government
payments were higher. Receipts from crops were doun both because
volume of marketings was lower and because prices were lower, reflecting

II -10
for the most part the effect of reductions in price support loan
levels on cotton and wheat. Receipts from livestock products were
up, however, as larger marketings of beef, dairy products, and eggs
more than offset lower marketings of hogs. Higher hog prices pro-
vided an offset to slightly lower prices received for other livestock
products.
The Department of Agriculture in April published a reappraisal
of the farm outlook for 1965 in which realized gross farm income was
projected at a little higher level than the $42.0 billion realized in
1964. Higher hog prices throughout the year and larger government
payments were important factors in this forecast. Higher costs for
feed, livestock, and overhead items were expected to hold net realized
income around the $12.6 billion of 1964, Exports of agricultural
products in fiscal 1964-65 were e:xpected to be down slightly from last
year's record $6.1 billion. Expected declines in exports of wheat,
cotton and tobacco were attributed to a return to a more normal demand
for wheat and sharply increased competition facing cotton and tobacco.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL SITUATION
Bank credit. Available data suggest that the slower growth
of total bank credit evident during Apiil has continued in May. Strength
in demand for bank loans also has continued, however, and banks are
meeting this demand by liquidating securities and, in New York City,
by increasing sales of negotiable CD's.
Total loans at city banks in the week ended May 5 increased
$725 million, considerably more than in the comparable week in recent
years. One-half of this growth occurred at New York City--loan growth
at other city banks was not unusually strong. The large increase in
loans was not translated to total bank credit because almost $600 mil-
lion in securities were liquidated by reporting banks; three-fourths of
the liquidation was in holdings of Treasury issues. Perhaps indicative
of heavier loan demands and increasing reserve pressures is the fact that
commercial banks, in the April 30 roll-over of 1-year bills, took only
$100 million of the $1 billion issue. Last year, they took over half
of an issue of the same size.
Three-fifths of the over $500 million increase in business
loans during the week of May 5 occurred at New York City banks; business
loans at other banks increased about in line with the 1964 pattern.
Expansion of commercial and industrial loans continued at New York
City banks in the week ended May 12, although at a somewhat reduced
pace. These data suggest that the widespread strength of business loan
demand in April continued into early May. Loans to metal and metal
products industries continued to show more than seasonal expansion,
and the liquidation of commodity dealer loans built up during the
dock strike moderated.

III -2
While the growth in business loans at New York City banks
during the first two reporting weeks in May was unusually strong, one-
fourth of the increase was accounted for by purchases of bankers
acceptances. These purchases apparently represent, in part, a tem-
porary reinvestment of funds obtained from maturing City of New York
notes. One large New York bank also was reported to have temporarily
invested some of the proceeds of CD sales in bankers acceptances in
anticipation of future loan demand.
Money supply and time deposits. On the basis of new seasonal
adjustments and a new weekly series, described in Appendix B, the
money stock increased at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.0 per
cent in April, rather than 5.3 per cent as estimated earlier. All of
this increase occurred during the first three weeks of April; prelim-
inary estimates suggest that the money stock has declined sharply
since then. From November through April demand deposits and currency
increased at an annual rate of 2.7 per cent, compared to 2.1 per cent
on the old seasonals.
Growth in time and savings deposits, on the basis of the
new seasonal factors was a shade higher in April than in March, but
both months were considerably below the substantial rates of growth
earlier this year. Preliminary estimates for the first two reporting
weeks of May indicate a continuation of the March-April rate of expan-
sion. Despite the moderation of time deposit growth since February,
ecpansion of these deposits has continued more rapid than in the corres-
ponding months of last year.

III -3
During the first two reporting weeks in May, New York City
banks increased their outstanding negotiable CD's by slightly over
$200 million, much more than in comparable periods of previous years.
CD's of city banks outside New York, on the other hand, continue to
fluctuate below the peak of early March. Offering rates on CD's have
not increased since April, with the most often quoted rate for 180-day
prime CD's remaining at 4-3/8 per cent.
Bank reserves. Average net borrowed reserves during the
first two weeks in May remained close to the $130 million level
recorded in April.- However, both average excess reserves and
borrowings rose somewhat from their April levels. A fuller discus-
sion of excess reserves and borrowings in the current expansion can
be found in Appendix A.
Federal funds traded more frequently at 4-1/8 per cent
during the first week in May than in the second, when additional
funds were supplied by country banks in the last week of their.bi-
weekly reserve settlement period.
Corporate and municipal bond markets. In the past two
weeks yields on corporate bonds have advanced to new highs for the
year, but those on seasoned municipal issues have remained on the
plateau that has prevailed since late February.

The further advance in corporate bond yields has carried
series on both new and seasoned issues up about to their 1964 highs and
has increased spreads against yields on long-term U.S. Government
bonds to the widest margins of the year--31 basis points in the case
of seasoned issues. These spreads are well above those that prevailed
during most of 1963 and 1964.
Upward pressures on corporate bond yields have reflected the
heavy volume of new offerings. Publicly offered bonds are expected
to total nearly $700 million in May, the largest monthly supply of such
issues in nearly four years. And total corporate financing--including
stock and private placements of bonds--is projected at more than $1.5
billion for the month, also a relatively high figure. With the supply
of new bond offerings unusually large, investors have remained selective,
notwithstanding the general availability of more generous yields.
Underwriters have had to break syndicates on five recent offerings in

III -5
order to move small, but hard-core, unsold remnants. The price adjust-
ments necessary to attract buyers have resulted in yields 2 to 7 basis
points above those at which originally offered.

In the municipal market, yields on seasoned bonds have been
stable for the past eleven weeks despite the heavy new supply and the
continuing large overhang of dealers' advertised inventories--currently
totaling about $800 million. During this period of relative yield
stability, reception for the large issues of well-known borrowers has
generally been favorable, but that for other issues has been less
enthusiastic. One factor that may help to explain why the near record
level of inventories has not caused further advances in municipal
yields is that bank dealers presently account for about one-half of the
"blue list" total, substantially more than was generally the case in
most earlier years of the present economic expansion. Moreover, banks
have accounted for about four-fifths of the $250 million increase in
this total.from its January low, As inventories build up, banks--with

III -6
their internally available financing--are under less immediate market
pressure than nonbank dealers to offer yield concessions to investors.
Stock market. After rising to an all-time high of 90.27 on
May 13, common stock prices (as measured by Standard and Poor's index
of 500 stocks) have eased off somewhat. Closing at 89.36 on May 18,
prices were one per cent below their recent high, but were up 4 per cent
from their late March low. At their recent high, the Standard and
Poor's "500" was selling at a price-earnings ratio of 18.05, considerably
below the 20.99 ratio at the mid-December 1961 peak. Since the beginning
of 1964, when the price-earnings ratio was 17.34--the Standard & Poor's
index has risen about 20 per cent while earnings have increased less--
about 15 per cent. Trading volume averaged 5.9 million shares a day
during the past two weeks.
Despite the 3-1/2 per cent advance in stock prices during
April, total customer credit in the stock market rose only $63 million
during the month. Most of this gain occurred in bank loans to others
than brokers and dealers which rose $49 million; customers' net debit
balances increased $14 million.
Mortgage markets. Mortgage funds generally have continued in
ample supply this spring, and trade expectations for coming months are
for little change in this situation. Contract interest rates on
conventional home mortgages, as reported by the FHA, remained unchanged
in April at 5.80 per cent for loans on new homes and 5.85 per cent for
loans on existing homes. The FHA-yield series on secondary market
transactions also remained unchanged at 5.45 per cent, marking the 25th
month of virtual stability at this reduced level.

III -7
Delinquency rates continued to decline in the first quarter
of the year below year-earlier levels, according to the regular survey
of the Mortgage Bankers Association of America. At 2.94 per cent of
total loans serviced by member respondents in the survey, the rate was
the lowest for a first quarter since 1962 and compared with 3.31 per
cent in the first quarter of 1964. Among other things, improvement
has reflected the generally higher level of after-tax incomes and better
lender screening and collection procedures.
The ratio of mortgages in the process of foreclosure at the
end of March was also under a year earlier--at 0.37 per cent of
mortgages serviced by MBA respondents--and was only slightly higher than
at the end of the firt quarters of 1962 and 1963.
U.S. Government securities markets. Trading activity in the
Treasury bond market contracted sharply in the wake of the May refunding
operation, and some weakening in prices developed. While results of
the financing were initially taken in stride by the market, investment
demand has been negligible and dealers have made little progress in
redistributing either their sizable holdings of the new note and bond
or of other longer-term issues. When books were closed on May 5, dealers
had $499 million of the 4-1/4's of May 1974 and another $114 million of
the 4's of August 1966, and by May 17 payment date their positions in
these issues were virtually unchanged. Moreover, dealers' inventories
of all bonds maturing after 5 years remained around $800 million.
Uith disappointment in the distribution of the new issues,
dealers tended to mark down prices. The reopened 4-1/4 per cent bond
declined an 1/8 of a point between the time books were closed and
payment date. On that date some support was given the market by

III -8
Treasury account purchases amounting to about $50 million in the
coupon area, four-fifths of uhich were the reopened 4-1/4's. Long-
run market expectations so far appear to have changed little, ho ever,
even in the face of distribution problems in the refunding and other
bearish factors, such as disappointment in Unit4d Kingdom's April
trade figures.

Treasury bill rates changed little over the past few weeks,
despite a sharp contraction in demand. Dealers' positions in bills
have risen somewhat from the relatively low level reached during the
recent financing. But dealers appear to be willing holders of bills
at current rate levels, given prospective market demand and the relative
availability of financing.

III -9
The market is not expecting any additions to the bill supply
in view of the Treasury's extremely comforable cash position. In fact,
one factor influencing interest rates in recent months has been the
larger than expected surplus that has developed in the Government's
cash budget, as noted in the section on the budget. In addition,
bill demands from official and private investors associated with the
May refunding also tended to put rates under downward pressure. Under
these conditions, the market may be accustoming itself to the idea that
bill rates could have a somewhat wider range of movement than previously
expected.
Federal budget. A larger than projected inflow of tax re-
ceipts during the spring, together with some restraint on expenditures,
has curtailed the size of the cash deficit likely to develop for fiscal
1965. Instead of the $4 billion deficit originally anticipated, it
now appears that the deficit will be on the order of $2 billion, as
shown in the table below. A commensurate decline is also expected
for the deficit as measured in the national income accounts.

The bulge in tax receipts is reflected in the enlarged cash
surplus expected in January-June 1965. This surplus, which is currently
projected at $8.1 billion, would be substantially larger than in any of
the previous four years; the only significantly larger first half
surplus during the post-war period occurred in 1956.
One of the factors influencing receipts appears to be that
final settlements on 1964 individual tax liabilities were $1.0 to $1.5
billion higher than anticipated. Preliminary indications are that these
increased collections of nonwithheld taxes for the most part reflect
last year's liability rather than the first instalment on estimated 1965
taxes. With national and personal income in 1964 about as originally
projected and with withholdings in 1964 actually above the minimum rate,
such an increase in tax collections indicates that the decline in 1964
tax liabilities as a result of the tax cut was not as large as first
anticipated. Moreover, thus far in 1965 withheld taxes have run well
ebove expectations, with May collections of such taxes especially large.
As a result of these developments, not only have actual collections been
increased for fiscal 1965 but estimates for fiscal 1966 have also been
revised upward.
With the surplus developing as these projections indicate,
the Treasury could enter the second half of calendar 1965 with a cash
operating balance of over $11 billion. Moreover, the deficit anticipated
in July-December 1965 is now projected at just over $10.5, having been
reduced somewhat by the carry-through of higher tax receipts. The
slightly reduced deficit in conjunction with the much enlarged cash
balance would enable the Treasury to undertake less net cash borrowing

III -11
in July-December 1965 than in the same period a year ago, as shown in
the accompanying table. This is contrary to expectations held only a
few weeks ago.

The projections shown above for the second half of calendar
1965 include the effect of the original excise tax and social security
proposals. The President's most recent tax proposal would reduce excises
by a further $1-3/4 billion effective January 1, 1966. This will reduce
receipts in January-June 1966 by about $700 million; in addition, the
proposed Federal pay increase would add about $425 million to expendi-
tures. One might now expect, therefore, that the January-June 1966
surplus would be reduced to around $7 billion.
Looking ahead then, two factors stand out: In fiscal 1966,
under the assumption of continued growth in income, the swing from
deficit to surplus in the cash budget is not likely to be any greater,
and possibly smaller, than has developed in fiscal 1965. At the same
time net cash borrowing in fiscal 1966 may be less than in fiscal 1965,
since the cash need has been reduced by the increase in current tax
receipts.

III -12
"Fiscal Drag". The larger surplus in the cash budget now
expected for the first half of 1965 is likely to be associated with a
virtual balance for seasonally adjusted Federal receipts and payments
in the national income accounts, as shown below. At the time of the
January budget document it had been anticipated that a moderate defi-
cit would develop in these accounts.

Surplus/Deficit 4.2 3.6 5.2 1.2 4.5
The balance which is apparently developing this half year in
the Federal sector of the national income accounts is the result not
only of higher individual tax payments and restraint on Federal expendi-
tures noted above but also of the enlarged corporate tax liability reported
for the first quarter of 1965. Translated to a "full-employment" surplus
calculation this balance in the accounts corresponds to a surplus of
about $5 billion. This is a somewhat larger surplus than earlier
calculations indicated and is accounted for by the apparently larger
individual tax liability at any given level of income and by the some-
what smaller expenditures.

III -13
These factors carry through the second half of 1965, so
that while the national income accounts are again likely to show a
deficit, this deficit is projected to be smaller than was implicit
in the January budget document. Still, the associated full employ-
ment surplus in July-December would decline to about $1 billion in
reflection of the initial stage of the excise tax cut and the in-
creased and retroactive social security payments.
The "fiscal drag", as measured by the full employment sur-
plus would rise in January-June 1966, when the new social security
taxes are proposed to go into effect. But the rise would be moderated
by enactment of the Administration's most recent fiscal proposals--
i.e., by the second stage of the excise tax cut and the Federal pay
rise. In that case, the surplus at full employment may be under
$5 billion.

U.S. balance of payments. Preliminary monthly data for April
show an over-all payments surplus of $160 million, about one-third the
size of the large March surplus, while external transactions in early
May were apparently in rough balance. The smaller surplus since March
represents, at least in part, less favorable seasonal influences. One
known unfavorable influence was a $50 million rise in U.S. purchases
of new foreign security issues as compared with March.
The large March surplus had benefitted from the unwinding of
the after-effects of the dock strike on trade movements and trade
payments. Export shipments rebounded in March, reflecting the catching
up on shipments delayed by the dock strike. At $2.8 billion, exports
were nearly 75.per cent higher than in February, and the trade surplus
jumped by nearly $900 million. Progress in clearing the docks
exercised a favorable influence on net receipts in April as well.
Further detail is now available on bank credit outflows in
March. Net outflows of loans and acceptance credits in the month
totaled $157 million, about forty per cent less than average outflow
of the preceding two months. Net outflows of long-term loans were
very sharply reduced from the extraordinarily high levels of January
and February to less than $50 million. However, short-term bank
credit outflow increased, for the most part because of a large rise
in acceptance credits to Japan. (These outflows include credits
extended by branches and agencies of foreign banks in the United
States as well as by domestic banks. Credits to foreigners by
domestic banks within the VFCR increased by $40 million in March.)

IV -2
The large outflows of long-term bank credits in January and
the early part of February reflected not only continued heavy lending
to European countries, but also a substantial increase in loans to
less-developed countries. Net borrowings by Latin American countries
in January-February were more than twice the average during the fourth
quarter of 1964, and outflows to African countries also rose very
sharply.
In March, though the net flow of long-term bank credit to
Latin America was much reduced, there were continued large outflows to
nonindustrial Asian and African countries. There were small net repay-
ments on loans to Europe and Canada, as new lending dried up following
the extension of the IET to long-term loans to these areas.

The outflow of short-term bank loans and acceptance credits in
March was little changed from the average of the preceding five months.
Following an exceptionally large outflow of short-term bank credits in
December, there was a net reflow in January; resumed outflows in
February and March averaged $130 million a month. Much of the fluctua-
tions in this period have reflected variations in acceptance credits
extended to Japan. A rise of $100 million in these credits in March
reflected renewed Japanese borrowing in part to finance imports from
the U.S. following the end of the dock strike. There has been a net
reflow on short-term bank credits to Latin America since the beginning
of the year, following exceptionally large outflows in the fourth
quarter.
The net reflux of liquid funds in March may have been very
large. Data reported by U.S. banks indicate a reflow out of short-
term investments in Canada of at least $75 million; but the total
March reflow, when complete data is available, may prove to have been
several times as large. There is some evidence of very large
repatriations of such funds by nonfinancial concerns, particularly
from Canada. The March reflow followed an average net flow during
the previous five months that was close to zero. In this five month
period, there were some outflows of such funds into U.S. dollar
denominated deposits in Canada and,during the fourth quarter of last
year, in Britain as well. These outflows were offset by reflows
from foreign-currency-denominated investments, largely from Britain
and Canada.

Industrial production in Western Europe. Under current
conditions, trends in industrial production in most European countries
provide only a very imperfect measure of trends in demand, because
plant capacity and labor supply have been limiting the growth of output.
In most countries expansion of output is proceeding about as quickly as
supply possibilities allow. However, this is not at present the case
in Italy and France, and perhaps also not in Belgium. In these countries
current movements of industrial production are reflecting the development
of demand more closely than elsewhere.

Since the halt of the decline in output in Italy last summer
and in France around the beginning of this year, aggregate Western
European industrial production has been rising again. After virtually
no change from February 1964 through the third quarter of 1964, output
rose by 2-1/2 per cent in the fourth quarter and by a further 2 per
cent from the fourth-quarter average to February.
In France, industrial activity has not yet turned up decisively;
the March index was a little below February's. The February-March
average was slightly above the December-January level, reflecting in
part the ending of work stoppages in the public sector.
Recent stability of the rate of output characterizes conditions
in most industrial sectors in France. Textile output had dropped by
one-fifth from the spring of 1964 to December, and passenger automobile
output by one-fourth from January to October 1964. Steel ingot pro-
duction continued to rise in November, and then declined a little to
the lower level that was maintained in January-March. Output in other
sectors rose through most of last year, but leveled off around the
year-end.
Producers' stocks of finished goods, which had been rising
since the spring of 1964, apparently stopped increasing in March and
were cut back in April, according to the INSEE April survey of business
opinion. Deterioration in producers' assessments of their order books
has also halted. Expectations found in the survey were that output
should be rising, on balance, in the current quarter.
Italian industrial output, after about a year during which

IV -6
began to turn up in the final quarter of 1964. IBy February, the
index of industrial production was 2-1/2 per cent above its September-
October level.
The restrictive actions taken by the Italian authorities during
1963-64, particularly in the monetary field, affected primarily private
demand for automobiles and investment demand. Investment demand was
weakened also by shrinkage of profit margins, as wage costs continued
to rise. Production of investment goods dropped by 10 per cent from
January 1964 to midyear. From July 1964 to December-January, output
in this field moved up by about 1 per cent. Consumer goods output
declined until the end of 1964: from April 1964 to December it dropped
by 8 per cent as production of motor vehicles and textiles, in particular,
fell. In early 1965 consumer goods output appeared to be stabilizing.
The rise in Italian industrial production since last autumn
has been most marked for iron and steel, chemicals, and petroleum products.
These industries have had strong growth trends, and their output declined
very little during last year's recession.
In Britain industrial output is believed to be still on an
upswing, although the recorded monthly movements are indecisive. After
remaining level for nine months, the index of industrial production
rose by 3-1/2 per cent from September to December, 1964. January
showed a further rise, but the February index was again at the December
level.
In so far as the apparent flattening out of the production
trend in early 1965 is not due to statistical measurement problems, it

IV -7
can probably be ascribed more to resource limitations than to a
slackening of demand. Fixed capital outlays have continued to rise
and, in addition, there was a sharp expansion of consumer and inventory
demand in the first quarter, partly because of pre-Budget buying.
Last year's rise in industrial production after September was
particularly strong in the engineering and allied industries, and also
in furniture and wood product industries. This advance was made possible,
in part, by an appreciable rise in labor productivity. In the textile
and apparel industries output remained level throughout 1964.
Industrial production in Germany is increasingly hampered by
supply difficulties. The labor situation remains very tight and in
March there were four times as many jobs vacant as persons unemployed
(after seasonal adjustment). According to recent surveys, producers
are working at the highest levels of capacity utilization ever recorded.
Demand, as measured by the inflow of new orders, continues to increase
in all industrial sectors. February-March new orders were 1-1/2 per
cent above the very high November-December (1964) level.
Despite the pressures on resources, German industrial production
rose 2-1/2 per cent between the third and fourth quarters of 1964, and
jumped sharply higher in January. For the first quarter as a whole
another advance of 2-1/2 per cent appears to have been made over the
preceding quarter.
Industrial production in Japan. Revised data for March indicate
a net decline in output of less than 1 per cent since last October's peak.
March output was up 1 per cent from February. Producers' (unsold)

IV -8
inventories of finished goods, seasonally adjusted, fell 2 per cent
further in March, possibly indicating a significant favorable change
from the position that had been reached in January, when these stocks
were at their highest of the current cycle.
Consumer durables output, including automobiles, had fallen
off during 1964 and continued to decline through February. Production
of investment goods appears to have been relatively level in recent
months.

APPENDIX A: EXCESS RESERVES*
Excess reserves of member banks have moved steadily downward
throughout most of the current expansion, reaching the lowest level
of the post-war period in the first half of 1964, and again in March
and April of this year.
The decline in excess reserves represents the continuation of
a trend which has prevailed throughout the post-accord period. During
each of the post-accord expansions, excess reserves declined, and each
time their level ultimately fell below the previous cyclical low.
What is worthy of note, however, is that bank reserve pressures have
not intensified as much during the current expansion as in previous
cycles. Thus, the forces influencing the trend and level of excess
reserves since 1962 are not fully comparable with those of previous
periods of expansion.
Country banks account, on the average, for about 85 per cent
of excess reserves. Therefore, any discussion of the factors tending
to reduce the level of excess reserves must revolve around the smaller
banks.
In recent years country banks have found it easier to enter
the Federal funds market (both as buyers and as sellers) because of the
growth of regional markets dealing in smaller transactions. They have
entered these markets in increasing numbers, although those regularly
doing so are still a small minority of all country banks. Larger
correspondent banks and brokers have advised country banks as to the
profits to be gained in the Federal funds market. Moreover, as the
average size of all banks increase, more banks find that they are able
to deal in units large enough to enter regional markets.
Higher levels of short-term interest rates always have en-
couraged banks to reduce their surplus reserves. This tendency has
been reinforced in the present expansion by emergence of a premium on
Federal funds over the discount rate. In this expansion, higher levels
of short-term rates also seem to have made larger banks more aggressive
both in seeking balances from their smaller correspondents and in making
efforts to purchase Federal funds from smaller banks, even if the size of
the trade is relatively small. Increased solicitation of their funds
has reinforced the tendency for smaller banks to manage their reserves
more closely.
Higher levels of short-term interest rates have been paralleled
by an increase in the rates paid on time deposits. With the rapid
increase in the quantity of time deposits, it is likely that increased
bank costs have also added to the pressure on banks to hold more of
their liquidity in short-term earning assets rather than in excess
reserves.

A -2
As the chart makes clear, changes in bank reserve pressures
generally affect excess reserves less than member bank borrowings.
At this stage of the current expansion, any additional restriction of
reserve availability might influence excess reserves relatively little,
since they are already at unusually low levels. The behavior of excess
reserves within the current expansion period provides some confirmation
of this possibility. Excess reserves declined more in 1962-63 than in
1964-65, even though interest rates continued to rise and reserve
availability was more limited in the latter period.

APPENDIX B: REVISION OF MONEY SUPPLY AND
COMMERCIAL BANK TIME DEPOSITS SERIES*
The annual review of seasonal factors and benchmarkcorrections
are nearly completed for the daily average money supply and commercial
bank time deposit series. This revision is not yet ready for
publication due to delay of the December benchmarks, but revised data
will be used internally, subject to such further revision as may re-
sult from the new benchmarks. This will enable us to use the latest
available seasonal factors and to maintain consistency with the recently
revised data on member bank reserves, deposits, and the credit proxy.
When the revised series are published, the semimonthly data
will be discontinued, and weekly seasonally adjusted series will be
substituted. The new weekly series will be published for the period
1959 to date, the same period covered by the revision of monthly seasonal
factors.
The accompanying table compares the revised and old series
from 1963 to date and provides weekly data beginning with March 1965.
Revisions in the monthly data are relatively small, with little effect
on the patterns of growth shown by the old series. Benchmarks for June
1964 reduced the levels of money supply and time deposits by $300 and
$100 million, respectively. The principal effects of changes in seasonal
factors on money supply were to smooth the November-February fluctuations
slightly. Changes in seasonal factors for time deposits reduced the
seasonally adjusted series from November to April, with the largest
reductions occurring in the first three months of the year, and increased
the level of the series from August to October.
As indicated below, growth rates for the revised and old series
are quite similar for 1963 and 1964. In the most recent months, the
revised money supply series shows slightly smaller fluctuations than
before revision, with growth from November to April at a 2.7 per cent
annual rate compared to 2.1 per cent for the old series. Time deposit
expansion over the same five months was at an annual rate of 15.7 on
both the revised and old basis, but the January-February acceleration
in growth has been revised downward slightly and expansion since
February has averaged slightly higher in the revised series than in
the old. Weekly seasonally adjusted figures for the two weeks ending
May 12 indicate a substantial reduction in money supply from the April
average, while time and savings deposits continued to expand at about
the March-April rate.

APPENDIX C: WEEKLY RETAIL SALES
Retail sales, as noted here two weeks ago, exhibited the
same pattern of general but uneven rise in the eight or so weeks prior
to Easter Sunday and a rather sharp decline the following week as they
had in each of the three preceding years. (See top panels of the
following chart.) Total sales in the second week following Easter
rose rather sharply and in the third week only a little. Excluding
sales of the automotive group from the total, the sharp rise of the
second week continued in the third week.
The gains in retail sales in the weeks ending May 1 and
May 8 (the latest data available) are very similar to those in the
corresponding weeks of the three preceding years, as is evident from
the lower panels of the chart. Thus, the effect of Easter on retail
sales appears to have run its course, and sales are now being affected
by the usual seasonal influences for this time of year.
