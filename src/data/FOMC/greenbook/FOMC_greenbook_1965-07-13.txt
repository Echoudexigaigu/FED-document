IN BROAD EVIEW
The latest information available, mainly for June, continues
to suggest expansion in activity but at a slower pace than in the first
quarter. Some statistical measures have been stronger than in the pre-
ceding two months but some have been weaker. Retail sales in June appear
to have been maintained, or possibly to have bettered, the record May
level. Unit auto sales experienced an upsurge to a level well above April
and May. Industrial production is tentatively indicated to have remained
at, or possibly to have exceeded somewhat, the May level. The labor
market remained strong in June and the unemployment rate was essentially
unchanged from the reduced May rate.
New orders for durable goods declined in May but the reductions
were mainly centered in steel, where an adjustment to more sustainable
levels has been generally expected, and in defense products following a
sharp run-up in April. Business inventory accumulation in May was re-
ported doun considerably from the high April rate.
Attention recently has focused more on commodity markets where
both wholesale and consumer prices have increased further. The rise in
wholesale prices has been attributable in large measure to reduced sup-
plies of livestock and meats and of some fresh fruits and vegetables.
Industrial prices through June continued to edge up at about their
earlier slow pace, with the increase for the first half year totaling
0.7 per cent. The consumer price index rose again in May and is likely
to show a further advance in June, largely reflecting higher food prices.
Stock market gyrations since mid-lay have occupied center stage
in recent business and financial attention. Very recently, common stock

I- 2
prices have recovered a portion of the earlier decline and trading ac-
tivity has returned to more nearly normal levels. The recent stock
price readjustment may be no more than a temporary market set-back but
it conceivably could be an early warning of a possible later decline
in business activity. The stock market, however, is hardly an unambiguous
leading indicator.
Bank credit expansion in June was very large with midmonth bor-
rowing for tax and dividend purposes and end-of-month borrowing for
window dressing purposes major influences. Both total credit and busi-
ness loan expansions, however, were less in the second quarter as a
whole than in the first. The money supply rose substantially in June
following a decline in late April and May. Growth in time deposits at
commercial banks also accelerated from the reduced May rate.
In other credit and debt markets, corporate bond yields have
eased slightly from quite advanced levels. Municipal security yields,
however, have remained under upward pressure. Mortgage yields have con-
tinued unchanged. U. S. Government intermediate- and long-term yields
have held in a narrow range while bill rates turned up in late June and
early July, after weeks of downward pressure; the 3-month bill yield on
July 6 was 3.87 per cent.
The U. S. balance of payments was in surplus on regular trans-
actions by about $200 million in the second quarter. Payments transac-
tions appear to have been in approximate balance in June. The nearly
$1 billion improvement in the payments position between the first and
second quarters was due in large part to the shift from large outflows
to inflows of bank credit. Renewed net bank credit outflows, though on

1- 3
a moderate scale, would appear the likeliest possibility over the
balance of the year. Other apparently nonrecurring factors behind the
second quarter improvement included a probably reduction in outflows
of direct investment capital from the accelerated rate of the first
quarter and a rebound in the trade surplus from the strike depressed
levels of the early months of thz year. Trade figures for May suggest,
however, that exports may have fallen off from the advanced levels of
last autumn.
Credit and capital market conditions abroad have shown diverse
developments in recent months. There have been marked increases in long-
term interest rates in countries where governmental policy has been fo-
cused on ress.ting inflation (Germany and the Netherlands) or where the
balance of payments is a matter of serious concern (the United Kingdom).
Credit conditions have been greatly eased in Italy and Japan, twhere
policy is aiming at stimulation of domestic activity.

THE DOMESTIC ECONOMY
Industrial production. Industrial production in June probably
equaled or was somewhat above the preliminary hay level of 141.3 per cent.
Available weekly production data, while not indicating any decline in output,
do not suggest any strong upward movement. Output apparently advanced
further for business equipment but changed little for consumer goods.
Overall output of materials is likely to have increased slightly.
Auto assemblies were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
about 9.5 million units, the same as in Bay. July production schedules
are also set at this rate. Output of home appliances, furniture,
television and other home goods, rose about 10 per cent from September
to March and then dropped somewhat in April and iay and possibly June.
Steel ingot production increased in June as uncertainty continued
regarding a peaceful settlement of the wage contract negotiations. In
June, output of petroleum products and coal increased and output of paper-
board and electric pover was maintained.
The following table shows quarterly indexes for the total index
of industrial production and major groupings beginning with the first quarter
of 1964.

*April-May average,
Consumer demands. Retail sales in June remained at about the
record May level, according to available weekly data. Personal income in
June apparently showed another sizable increase, with the rise again
mainly attributable to gains in employment and higher wages and salaries.
For the second quarter as a whole, the rise in consumer purchases
of goods and services is now estimated at some $4 billion, annual rate--
not ouite so large as the increase in personal disposable income. The
saving rate, however, apparently was up only slightly from 6.7 per cent
in the first quarter.
A feature of consumer spending in the second quarter was the
large rise in purchases of nondurable goods--an increase of about $4 bil-
lion in the annual rate. Retail sales at nondurable goods stores were up
more than 2 per cent from the first quarter, with most types of stores
participating in the advance although apparel and department stores changed
little. Much of the large increase in sales at food stores represented

II -3
higher retail prices. Altogether, consumer purchases of nondurable
goods were about 7 per cent higher than in the spring of 1964.
The increase in purchases of nondurable goods was in part off-
set by a decline in auto purchases in the second quarter. As compared
with a year earlier, consumer purchases of durable goods as a whole were
up about 5 per cent, however.
Sales of new domestic automobiles rose sharply in June to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 8.8 million vehicles, compared with
8.2 and 8.1 in April and May. The average rate of sales in the second
quarter was 8.4 million, down from 9.3 million in the first quarter.
Some purchases may have been postponed from May to June by uncertainty
about excise taxes. Sales contests also helped boost sales in June.
Dealer new car inventories as of June 20 were 7 per cent above
the end of iMay and represented 49 days' supply, well above average for
this season. Industry sources anticipate that inventories will remain
unusually high this summer.
Consumer credit. Instalment borrowing sloued after a sharp
spurt in April, but consumers continued to use more instalment credit
for automobiles and especially for GAF purchases than they had in the
first quarter of the year.
Officers of the two largest finance companies and the three
major trade associations in the consumer credit field met with Board
members and senior staff June 23 to discuss current credit quality and
collection experience. The industry spokesmen reported that consumers
are making payments about as promptly today as at any time in recent years.
A degree of uncertainty was suggested, however, about the trend in port-
folio quality of some of the small lenders.

Construction activity. Construction expenditures rose slightly
in June to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $67.7 billion. This was
a new high, taking account of seasonal and other revisions back to 1962.
For thr first half-year as a whole, construction activity averaged 2 per
cent more than a year earlier; both private residential and public expendi-
tures changed little on average from a year earlier while business expen-
ditures were up more than a tenth.
Seasonally adjusted housing starts, which--on the basis of
revised figures--had advanced 7 per cent in the previous three months,
declined in May. For April and May combined, the annual rate averaged
1.51 million. This was moderately above the first quarter low but still
somewhat below the average for the year 1964.
Seasonally adjusted residential building permits, unlike starts,
recovered somewhat in May after a drop in April. The May increase was
concentrated in single family units, for which permits had tended down-
ward in recent months. Permits for multifamily units in May reached a
new low for the year, but were still above the reduced rate of last
December.

A factor in the May increase in permits for single family homes
may have been the improved inventory position reported by merchant builders.
While stocks of unsold homes have changed very little since last August,
they were lower in April both absolutely and in relation to unit sales than
a year earlier. Also, buying intentions for both new and existing houses
in April were about as high or higher than at this time in other recent
years, according to the Census Bureau. A survey made this spring by
the National Association of Real Estate Boards indicated that inquiries
by prospective purchasers about existing houses of good quality have tended
to exceed available listings and that, except for poorly located properties,
values have remained stable.
Orders for durable goods. New orders for durable goods declined
5 per cent in May because of large decreases for steel and defense products.
Steel orders have fallen steadily since February when ordering in antici-
pation of a strike was at a peak and the May level was the lowest since
December 1963. Defense orders had spurted sharply in April, taking total

II -6
durable new orders up to a neu peak; in May new defense orders reverted
to about the level prevailing in the first 3 months of the year and were
also about unchanged from a year earlier.
New orders for machinery and equipment were maintained in Hay
at a level moderately above the first quarter average and the year-earlier
level. For the remaining durable goods, new orders have changed little
in recent months at a level well above a year ago.

Total shipments of durable goods declined moderately in INay as
steel shipments dropped nearly a fifth from the record April level.
Shipments remained below new orders and the durable goods order backlog rose
further despite a drop in the steel industry.
Unfilled orders for steel have declined 13 per cent since February
but are still vell above a year ago. Unfilled orders for all other durable
goods combined rose 4-1/2 per cent between February and May and the total
durable backlog increased 3 per cent, to a level 15 per cent above 1ay
1964.

II -7
Business inventories. Preliminary figures indicate a substantial
decline in the rate of business inventory accumulation in May: the book
value increase totaled about $400 million as compared with an April increase
of over $800 million (revised upward substantially from the preliminary
$680 million). 1Sith the present May showing, the average monthly gain during
the first 2 months of the second quarter was moderately smaller than the
first quarter average.
The May decline in the rate of accumulation was primarily con-
centrated in trade. At retail, auto dealer stocks continued to rise sharply
but at most other types of stores inventories generally changed little or
declined moderately and the total book value increase was much lover than
in earlier months of the year. The rate of accumulation also dropped sharply
at wholesalers.
Inventory accumulation by manufacturers in May continued at about
the moderate pace of the first four months of the year -- around $260 million
per month -- and in May as in earlier months the bulk of the accumulation
was in the durable goods sector.
Accumulation of steel stocks in May continued to dominate the
durable total, but there was a pronounced slowdown in accumulation by steel
consumers and a step-up at steel mills. In April, steel mills had drawn
heavily on their finished stocks to permit what may have been record
accumulation by consumers (nearly 1.5 million tons). In May, accumulation
by consumers dropped sharply to 400,003 tons -, the smallest monthly amount
since last September -- while steel mills restored part of the sharp April
cut in their finished steel holdings.

II -8
Stocks of steel in the hands of consumers totaled 15.5 million
tons at the end of 1-ay. This was well above the level of around 12 million
tons reached at the peaks of both the 1962 and 1963 steel build-ups,
but consumption is also up sharply and the inventory-consumption ratio of
2.7 in May was about the same as at those two earlier peaks.
Uith the tapering off in accumulation of steel by consumers, the
earlier large rise in book value of stocks of materials and supplies held by
durable goods producers slowed considerably in May. On the other hand,
durable stocks of finished goods, which in April vere somewhat below the
end-of-1964 level, rose appreciably in May, with much of the increase
at steel mills,

Labor market. The job situation remained relatively strong in
June. Employment advanced moderately. The unemployment rate was 4.7 per
cent, little changed from the 4.6 per cent in May and down from the 5.3

II -9
per cent of a year earlier. For most groups changes in unemployment were
largely seasonal. The rate continued low among married men -- 2.4 per cent --
and there was little improvement for teenagers -- 14 per cent. Among
women, however, the unemployment rate rose in June following a decline
in May.
The number of youths who entered the work force in June was
smaller than expected and the seasonally adjusted teenage labor force de-
clined by 230,000. The unusual circumstance that the survey week in June --
the week including the 12th -- was the earliest possible in the month and
many schools were still in session, probably resulted in a smaller increase
in both labor force and in unemployment of young people than if the survey
had been taken later in the month. Because of this, the July data may show
a more than seasonal rise in unemployment.
Employment of women in June increased more than seasonally and
accounted for a large part of the total employment gain over the month.
The early survey week also resulted in a larger than usual number of school
teachers counted as employed in June. Usually many teachers leave the labor
market for the suamer after school sessions end.
Of interest is the rise in June for the second consecutive month
in the number of workers on part time for economic reasons. This is one
of the most cyclically sensitive of the household survey series and in the
past has responded to movements in economic conditions somewhat earlier than
the overall employment and unemployment series. In June there were 2
million workers on involuntary part time. This was about 200,000 above the
April low, indicating some easing in work-time schedules. However, the
number was still 300,000 fewer than in June 1964.

II -10
Based on the first half averages, the total labor force expanded
by 1.1 million from 1964 to 1965. This is almost 300,000 less than called
for in the official labor force projections. The deficiency was mainly
among youths. Total employment expanded by about 1.5 million in the same
period. For adult men and women employment gains substantially exceeded
labor force increases and unemployment declined. For youths, employment
gains about matched those in the labor force and unemployment showed
little change over the year.
Hours and earnings. The average workweek in manufacturing has
become slightly shorter than earlier this year, although a considerable
amount of overtime work has continued. Weekly hours are estimated to
average 41.3 hours in the second quarter, down from the postwar record of
41.4 in the first quarter. In the second quarter of 1964, the workweek
averaged 40.6 hours.
Average hourly earnings in manufacturing continued to increase
in the second quarter at about the same rate as in the preceding two years.
At $2.61 in the second quarter, hourly earnings were 8 cents or approxi-
mately 3.5 per cent higher than in the second quarter of 1964. A rise of
8 cents was also reported in the preceding year. Although hourly rates
continued to rise, weekly earnings, seasonally adjusted, fell slightly in
the second quarter, marking the first quarterly reduction since 1960.
Over the past year, however, veekly earnings have risen a little more than
hourly earnings because of the longer workweek and increased overtime pay.
At over $107 in the second quarter, weekly earnings were 4 per cent above
a year earlier.

II -11
Prices. The wholesale commodity price index continued to
rise through June. The estimate for the last week of the month, 102.7
per cent of the 1957-59 average, was up 0.6 per cent from the monthly
index for mid-May and 2 per cent from the end of 1964. Rising prices
of foodstuffs continued to account for most of the increase; the end-
of-June estimate for foodstuffs was up more than 2 per cent from mid-May
and 6 per cent from December. The index for industrial commodities,
which had risen 0.2 per cent in May, edged up another 0.1 per cent in
June. The increase through the first half of the year amounted to 0.7
per cent--almost the same as the rise in the fourth quarter of last year.
At an estimated 102.1 per cent of the 1957-59 average, industrial commod-
ities are up nearly 2 per cent from a low in early 1963 but only 0.5 per
cent from the high in early 1960.
The rise in prices of livestock and meats--reflecting a con-
siderably greater-than-seasonal decline in marketings of meat animals--
accelerated in flay and early June. On a seasonally adjusted basis,
production of red meat in the second quarter was doun more than a tenth
from the fourth quarter of last year. At mid-year, livestock prices were
up a third and meat prices a fifth from last December, and they were not
far below the peak levels attained in the spring of 1958 when a cycle
of livestock marketings reached a low. At these high levels, prices are
likely to encounter growing resistance from both meat packers and consumers.
Supplies of many spring and summer vegetables also have been smaller than
usual, chiefly because harvesting was delayed by unfavorable weather.

II -12
Among industrial commodities, the comprehensive monthly
figures for mid-May show that the previously reported increases for
copper and aluminum products raised the nonferrous metals group about
2 per cent further, to a point almost a fifth above the low in early
1963. Recently, indicators of market conditions for nonferrous metals
have presented conflicting evidence* Prices of scrap generally are
higher than a month ago. Hovever, London prices for refined copper
and lead have fallen, copper futures have declined in New York, and tin
prices have dropped from a very high level. (Although doun from recent
highs, copper on the Net York and London exchanges is still substantially
above the price maintained by the primary producers.) In this country,
the approaching termination of inventory accumulation for tinplate--which
accounts for 40 per cent of U.S. consumption of tin--and for galvanized
steel products may be easing demands for tin and zinc. Steel scrap prices
have already declined appreciably in anticipation of a curtailment in
steel production.
In Hay, prices of hides and skins increased a tenth, mainly
reflecting the reduction in marketings of livestock. Gasoline rose
substantially, and the petroleum products group--at 95.4 per cent of the
1957-59 average--was up 6 per cent from the low of last September. Tires
rose moderately, as previously reported, and filter-tip cigarettes in-
creased. Following negotiation of a new labor contract in the can indus-
try, prices of metal containers vent up 2.5 per cent. Scattered additional
increases for machinery and equipment raised the group average .1 per
cent further. Prices of nonmetallic minerals, lumber, industrial chemical,

II -13
motor vehicles, furniture, and other household durable goods generally
were stable.
The consumer price index in Hay rose to 109.6 per cent of the
1957-59 average, 0.3 per cent above April and 0.6 per cent above IIarch.
This stepped-up rate of increase is attributable to the developments in
markets for foodstuffs described above. Prices of fruits and vegetables
showed a seasonal rise that vas greater than usual. At the same time
retail prices of meats, rather than declining to a seasonal low, edged up.
The recent large increases in wholesale meat prices will be reflected in
the consumer indexes for June.
Nonfood commodities rose 0.2 per cent in lay, with increases
for apparel, gasoline and cigarettes only partly offset by very small
decreases for some durable goods. Services also rose 0.2 per cent.
Reflecting chiefly the recent changes for foods, the year-over-
year increase in the total CPI widened to 1.7 per cent from 1.1 per cent
in the first quarter. Foods were 2.3 per cent above a year earlier, with
fresh fruits and vegetables up more than 10 per cent. Nonfood
commodities were 0.9 per cent higher and services were up 2.3 per cent.
Agriculture. Supplies of foodstuffs in mid-1965 are considerably
smaller than a year ago. Upward pressure on prices from reduced supplies
of pork, lamb, beef, potatoes, and fresh vegetables is being accentuated
by rising consumer incomes. Prices received by farmers in June averaged
10 per cent above a year ago, principally because of higher prices for hogs
and beef cattle. Prices received are more favorable relative to prices
paid by farmers than a year ago: the parity ratio on June 15 was 79
(1910-14 = 100) compared with 74 a year earlier.

II -14
On the demand side, consumei spending for food has increased.
Per capita expenditures in the first quarter were 4.5 per cent above a
year earlier, and the increase probably was larger in the second quarter.
Exports of farm products, at an annual rate of $6.1 billion in the July-
April period, were about equal to a year earlier, although the commodity
mix was different. Despite higher retail prices of meats and vegetables,
the Department of Agriculture has recently estimated that the average family
will spend only 13.3 per cent of its disposable income on food in 1965 as
compared with 13.5 per cent in 1964 and 20.0 per cent in 1960.
On the supply side, per capita supplies of pork and lamb were
S per cent below year-earlier levels in June and beef was 7 per cent less
than the extremely large production in June last year. Broiler production,
currently up a little from a year ago, is expanding rapidly and may exceed
year-earlier levels by 8 to 10 per cent in the third quarter. Carryover
stocks of potatoes from the small 1964 crop are being supplemented by
new crop supplies and lettuce, quite short in April and hay, is now in
ample supply.
In the third quarter, supplies of fresh vegetables and potatoes
are expected to be more plentiful than a year ago when serious drought
reduced yields. Because of depleted stocks, however, it will probably
be some time before potato prices work down. Pork supplies will be doun
at least 10 per cent from a year earlier; the decrease would be still
larger if producers should start withholding hogs for breeding. USDA
experts are tentatively projecting third and fourth quarter cattle slaughter
at year-ago levels.

II -15
Stocks of feed grains and soybeans are below a year ago, largely
because of the lower yields of 1964. Because of tight supplies of 'free
corn, the CCC has been able to sell two-thirds more corn in the domestic
market than last year. The wheat carryover is the same as last year and
cotton stocks are up 1.3 million bales bringing the cotton carryover to
13.4 million bales, an amount equal to one year's normal disappearance.
Through May, the CCC had reduced holdings of farm products under price
support to $6.0 billion from $7.4 billion in May 1964.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL SITUATION
Bank credit. Seasonally adjusted bank credit rose by about
$3.5 billion in June according to preliminary estimates. This would be over
twice the rate of increase of April-May and more than the very large expan-
sion of March, and reflects, in part, heavy tax and dividend borrowing at
midmonth and windou dressing at month end. For the second quarter as a
whole, however, the increase in bank credit was about 11 per cent, annual
rate, and was somewhat below the advanced first quarter rate.
A $2.7 billion increase in loans at weekly reporting banks during
the one week that encompassed the tax and dividend dates this year was
40 per cent larger than the increase in loans for the two weeks that cov-
ered the same dates last year; the increase in business loans was almost
twice as large. Corporate tax payments this June were only $300 million
larger than last year and there was a larger volume of maturing CD's and
tax bills outstanding. These comparisons suggest that the continuing
strong demand for external financing may be reflecting a shortfall of busi-
ness liquid assets relative to the demand for them at the higher pace of
business activity.
Seasonally adjusted business loans, for the whole month of June,
increased at an estimated annual rate of about 25 per cent--again larger
than April-May but slightly less thanthe unusual first quarter rate.
While borrowing was particularly heavy in the petroleum and chemicals,
miscellaneous manufacturing and mining, and public utility groups, most
industry categories increased their bank borrowing in June, as is typical
around quarterly tax dates. Commodity dealers, however, continued to reduce

III -2
their loans more than seasonally from levels reached during the dock
strike. In addition, the metals and metal products group showed only a
normal seasonal increase in bank borrowing, perhaps suggesting a deceler-
ation in the rate of steel accumulation.
Business loans accounted for less of the increase in bank credit
in June than in previous months this year; a larger share was attributable
to expansion in loans to security dealers and finance companies. These
latter borrowers traditionally increase their bank financing in June in
order to absorb pucchases of securities and maturing notes and RP's
liquidated by business and others to provide funds for tax payments. This
year, however, such loans increased more than seasonally. Loans to secur-
ity dealers also rose quite sharply late in the month, presumably as the
result of heavy maturities of June 30 corporate RP's based on Treasury
and agency issues. Businesses, for window dressing purposes, prefer to
show money balances rather than RP's on their balance sheets.
Commercial banks reduced their holdings of Treasury issues in
June by about $600 million (seasonally adjusted), but this was more than-off-
set by purchases of other securities. At city banks, most of the decline
in Governments during the first four weeks of June was in bills, but bank
bill purchases increased at the end of the month, most likely for window
dressing purposes. The large increase in other securities was due in
part to the delivery of two Federal agency issues earlier in the month.
Money supply and time deposits. After declining sharply in
late April and May, when there was an unusually large build-up in U. S.
Government deposits, the seasonally adjusted money stock rose by $1.7 bil-
lion in June. A considerable part of this increase occurred in the first

III -3
two weeks of che month as Treasury deposits were reduced. During the
last week of June, the money stock again declined as Treasury deposits
rose to a record high at midyear of $11.5 billion. The June expansion
brought the increase in the seasonally adjusted money stock during the
first half of the year to an annual rate of 2.5 per cent.
Time deposit growth also accelerated in June from the reduced
May rate. In June, both savings and other time deposits grew more rapidly
than last year. Outstanding CD's, as expected, declined about $325 million
at the tax date, but then began to increase again. At month-end CD's out-
standing at banks outside New York were at the highest level since early
March, after over three months of sidewise movement. Outstandings at
New York City banks, however, had not fully regained their pre-tax period
level. New York banks appear to have been less aggressive in their CD
offerings recently.
Even with the acceleration of time deposit growth in June, the
rate of growth of such deposits in the second quarter was below that of both
the first quarter and the average for all of 1964. This lower rate of
expansion may reflect, in part, the competition from larger market offer-
ings of new security issues during the second quarter, the heavy indi-
vidual income tax payments in April, and the high cost and possibly Regu-
lation Q impediments to issuing CD's, as well as the normal reaction to
the surge of time deposit growth early in the year.
Bank reserves. Average net borrowed reserves of member banks
increased from $159 million in May to $177 million in June./ Borrowings
1/ Based on the average of daily figures for all of the reserve weeks
ending in the month as used in the reserve memorandum to the FOMC.

III -4
by member banks increased $44 million, on the average, to $534 million in
June, while average excess reserves increased $26 million to $537 million.
The effective rate on Federal funds was at 4-1/8 per cent on 20 of the 24
trading days in June.
Corporate and municipal bond markets. Average yields on new
corporate bonds appear to have peaked around mid-June at the time of the
large Chase Manhattan Bank offering. Since then they have decreased
little, as the volume of new corporate offerings in immediate prospect
has contracted and as underwriters' unsold balances of older issues have
been reduced substantially. In the municipal bond market, on the other
hand, congestion continues--despite some reduction in advertised inven-
tories from the $900 million record reached earlier in June--and upward
pressures on yields have been maintained.
At current levels average yields on new corporate bonds are
higher than they have been since late 1961 and are about 1/4 of a per-
centage point above the 4.35 level prevailing early in the year. And
municipal bond yields (Moody's Aaa series) are within one basis point of
the three-year peak reached in late 1963. Since yields on Treasury bonds
have remained generally stable, the spread between new corporate bonds and
Treasury issues has widened to more than 40 basis points for the first time
in three years. Similarly, the margin by which Treasury issues exceed
tax except yields--at about 95 basis points--is currently the narrowest
since late 1962.

July offerings of corporate bonds are expected to remain large,
declining less than seasonally at this time of year. With a smaller
currently scheduled supply of public offerings, upward pressures on yields
are likely to be less intense than in May and June. Factors that compli-
cate supply forecasts atthis time include the possibility of additional
public offerings of capital notes or debentures by large banks in the
period immediately ahead and uncertainties over the magnitude of additional
bond financing by the Bell System.
In the municipal bond market, July offerings are expected to
about equal those in May and June. If commercial bank interest in such
offerings continues at a reduced level, upward pressures recently in evi-
dence on municipal bond yields may persist.

Stock market. In late June, stock prices experienced a further
sharp decline after stabilizing in light trading at a level about 6 per cent
below their mid-lay peak. By June 28, Standard and Poor's index of 500
stocks was doun about 10 per cent from the high. This drop, however, was
followed by an equally sharp recovery--both on very heavy trading volume
(10.5 million shares on June 29). At the July 6 close of 84.99, about a
third of the total loss had been erased. Indications are that institutional
buyers re-entered the market, particularly for blue chip issues, suggesting
confidence in the basic strength of both the economy and the stock market.
Financial intermediaries. In late June the Federal Home Loan
Bank Board brought further pressure on savings and loan associations that
had raised rates since the first of the year. Those which have not cut
back by July 1 to the rates prevailing at the end of 1964, will be denied
the additional lending authority provided in the Housing Act of 1964. Even
after a roll-back, loans to these associations for expansion purposes will
be denied for a number of months. Early this year, some West Coast asso-

III -7
ciations uhich had been using high rates to attract savings capital from
other sections of the country, experienced a sharp contraction in inflous
after the increase in interest rates paid by commercial banks. Uhen
some associations raised rates to maintain their differential, the FHLBB
began a series of restrictive actions, denying these associations loans
to expand their lending activities. At no time, however, have they
been denied funds to meet withdrawals.
During the first five months of this year, net savings flows
to depositary-type institutions totaled a record $12.6 billion, one-tenth
larger than the corresponding period of 1964. All of this year-over-year
growth, hovever, vas concentrated in the first quarter and occurred in
time and savings deposits at commercial banks where rates were raised at
the start of the year; gains in both savings capital at savings and loan
associations and in regular deposits at mutual savings banks were smaller
than in early 1964. In April, when tax payments were larger than usual,
withdrawals of savings by individuals at all three types of institutions
were also larger than usual. Since then, inflous at both savings and
loan associations and mutual savings banks have continued to lag 1964
while second quarter inflous to commercial banks have not been sustained
at their earlier high level.
Home mortgage markets. Lender competition for mortgages has
continued active this year, although savings inflous to the specialized
mortgage-lending institutions have remained belou year-earlier levels.
In lay, secondary yields on FHA-insured mortgages held at 5.45 per cent,
an average which has prevailed with virtually no change for more than two

III -C
years. Contract interest rates for conventional first mortgages on homes
have also been maintained at the rates prevailing since early 1963,
according to the Federal Housing Administration. For new home loans, the
average was 5.80 per cent; for loans on existing homes, 5.85 per cent.
Trade expectations generally are that these rates will continue.
Loan-to-price ratios and maturities on conventional first mortgages
in Hay generally changed little from April as well as from a year earlier.
Average loan amounts continued appreciably higher than a year earlier,
reflecting upgrading by home purchasers and higher prices. In the case
of new home loans, over the first five months of this year as a whole,
loan-to-price ratios have tended to be less liberal than a year earlier and
maturities have been liberalized only fractionally further.

Activity by the Federal National Nortgage Association in the
secondary market has continued relatively limited in recent months.
However, public offering this June for delivery on July 1 of $525 million
of participation certificates backed by a pool of mortgages held jointly
by FNMA and the VA was very well received. FRiA plans to offer another
$750 million of such certificates in the new fiscal year.
U. S. Government securities market. Yields on intermediate-
and long-term Treasury securities have continued to fluctuate in a narrow
range in recent weeks. Yields on Treasury bills and other short-term
Treasury issues, however, turned up in late June and early July, after
several weeks of persistent downward pressure.

The Treasury bond market displayed some signs of strength around
mid-June, although price gains were limited and they reflected improved
professional demand and System buying rather than any pick-up in invest-
ment demand. Contributing to the market improvement at that time,
were the working off of congestion in the corporate bond market and a
Treasury official's speech which highlighted the relatively moderate
Treasury financing job in the second half of 1965. In late June and early
July, however, Treasury bond prices again drifted lower, mainly reflecting
profit-taking by dealers in a market atmosphere characterized by continued
light investment demand.
In recent weeks, dealers have made net purchases of coupon issues
from private investors, although their positions in longer-term bonds were
reduced somewhat as the System bought more than offsetting amounts of this
market supply. During June the dealers bought, net, nearly $150 million
of over-5-year bonds from private investors while selling $210 million to
the System. These transactions reduced dealer holdings of longer-term
bonds to about $650 million on July 6.

III -11
Including all maturities, the System purchased nearly $400 million
of coupon issues during June, one of the largest monthly totals in recent
years. Such purchases in conjunction with sizeable purchases of bills
from foreign accounts and the insertion of reserves through repurchase
agreements and through a large foreign currency swap transaction permitted
the Desk to provide large amounts of needed reserves after mid-June and
early July without buying bills directly from dealers.
The absence of the System 2rom the dealer bill market in recent
weeks was an important factor which tended to put upward pressure on bill
rates. The dealers.stockpiled bills in anticipation of substantial S-stem
purchases. Uhen these purchases failed to materialize, dealers made
efforts to lighten their holdings. Uith net bill demand from the public
also reduced, yields rose. In the auction held Friday July 2, the 3-
month bill was issued at 3.05 per cent, up 7 basis points from the
previous weekly bill auction. Mieanwhile, other money market rates have
generally held in a narrow range, although dealer loan rates in New York
City firmed in late June and early July.
Treasury finance. The Treasury ended the fiscal year with a
large cash operating balance of $11.5 billion, more than $1 billion
above a year ago, but only about $1/4 billion above the end of fiscal
1963. In the latter year, however, the Treasury had undertaken some
anticipatory borrowing in June. The mid-1965 cash balance reflects a
larger than expected increase in ta: receipts, especially in the second
quarter of this year, which served to reduce the fiscal 1965 cash budget
deficit to about $2 billion. The cash deficit in fiscal 1964 had been
almost $5 billion.

III -12
In the second half of calendar 1565 the cash deficit is expected
to be in the neighborhood of $10 billion, but in view of the existing
size of the cash balance, net cash borrowing by the Treasury may be
held to $4 or $5 billion, as compared uith $6.7 billion in the second half
of 1964. This projection takes into account the recent excise tax cut
and social security legislation expected to be passed by Congress shortly.
Uhile the provisions of the social security bill that will
finally be passed by the Congress are still in part uncertain (as ex-
plained in more detail in Appendix A. the expansive effect of the program
lill be concentrated in the second half of 1965, with a one-time retro-
active payment of about $700 million and a 7 per cent increase in monthly
beneifts of about $1.4 billion at an annual rate. An increase in social
security taxes, including those formedicare, in the neighborhood of
$6 billion (with the exact size depending on the bill finally agreed to)
is scheduled to become effective January 1, 1966. iedicare payments are
scheduled to begin July 1, 1966.
The lower excises became effective June 22 (iith cuts on two
items retroactive to mid-Hay). The bill provides for reductions totaling
$4.G billion over a three and a half year period. This total is about $030
million larger than the Administration request, with the additional re-
ductions to take effect in 1967 and after. In the second half of 1965,
receipts from excises will be lowered by about $700 million. (The schedule
of excise tax cuts is shoun in Table 1 of Appendix B).

III -13
The net effect of these programs on the various Federal budgets -
cash, national income, and full employment -- is shovn quarterly in
Table 2 of Appendix B. These results are about the same as earlier pro-
jections in that they show a turn to a more e::pansive fiscal policy in the
second half of 1965, as measured by the lover full employment surplus
in the third and fourth quarters. Thiss full-employment surplus rises
again in the first half of 1966 but to a level below that of the first
half of this year.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
U.S. balance of payments. International payments transactions
of the United States were in approximate balance in June, according to
preliminary indicators, following surpluses in the three preceding
months. A less favorable outcome in June would be expected on seasonal
grounds. For the second quarter as a whole, the balance on regular
transactions may be estimated as a surplus of around $200 million,
seasonally adjusted. This would compare with a seasonally adjusted
deficit of $733 million in the first quarter. Official settlements in
the second quarter apparently showed a modest surplus.
The $900 million seasonally adjusted improvement in the
balance on regular transactions between the first and the second
quarters reflected the initial impact of the President's program which
was on a scale not likely to be sustained in the rest of the year. A
major factor was a reversal of outflows of bank credit. In the first
quarter net outflows of long- and short-term bank loans and acceptance
credits to foreigners totaled about $600 million. In April and May,
by contrast, there were inflows in the form of net repayments on such
credits totaling $260 million. In these two months, claims covered by
the VFCR guidelines declined by about $230 million. At the end of May,
banks under the VFCR program were in a position to increase their loans
and other claims on foreigners by $300 million during the remainder of
the year without exceeding their combined target.

IV -2
Some of the improvement in the over-all payments position in
the second quarter probably reflected lower direct investment outflows.
Recently published balance of payments estimates for the first quarter
show an outflow of direct investment capital of $1 billion, seasonally
adjusted. This outflow was at a rate perhaps half again as large as
might have been expected on the basis of earlier trends and of known
plans for capital expenditures by foreign affiliates of U.S. companies.
The size of the outflow suggests that funds were transferred early in
the year in anticipation of new government measures to deal with the
balance of payments. The transferred funds were probably earmarked
for capital expenditures to be made in the course of the year, and
therefore, a marked slowing down in outflows of direct investment
capital could be expected to have occurred following announcement of
the President's program. The quarterly rate of these outflows in the
second and succeeding quarters may have been cut by as much as $1/2
billion, as compared with the first quarter.
Among other capital movements in the second quarter, reflows
of liquid funds out of deposits and short-term investments abroad
appear on the basis of incomplete data for April and May to have been
smaller than in the first quarter. Exceptionally large reflows of such
funds had occurred in March. Also, preliminary figures on U.S. purchases of
new foreign security issues in the period April-June show little
change from the preceding three months after seasonal adjustment.
Data on foreign trade are now available through May, but
underlying trends in exports and imports in recent months still remain

IV -3
obscured by distortions introduced by the dock strike. Both exports
and imports in May continued to reflect the catching up of strike-
delayed shipments, though both fell off further from the peak reached
in March, the first full month after the end of the strike. The
effect of these irregular trade movements on the payments position is
difficult to assess. Compared with the depressed $1 billion rate of
trade surplus in the first quarter, the surplus on merchandise trade
movements in April-May averaged more than $500 million higher at a
quarterly rate. Actual net receipts from trade probably did not show
such a large improvement between these two periods.
For the six months December through May, exports averaged
slightly above $25 billion at an annual rate and imports nearly $20
billion. Compared with the months immediately preceding this period,
exports were lower by around $1 billion and imports were higher by
about $1-1/2 billion at an annual rate. The reduced foreign demands
behind the falling off in exports suggested by this comparison are
hard to pinpoint. Besides the dock strike distortions, data on the
destination of exports over this period are affected by statistical
reclassifications. Making crude allowances for these effects, however,
it would appear that while exports to Canada have continued to expand,
there was some slackening of demands for U.S. exports from other
industrial countries and a more marked reduction in purchases by the
nonindustrial countries from the peak rates reached last autumn.
Although recent trends are difficult to interpret, about
one-fourth of the apparent sharp rise in imports since last fall seems

IV -4
to have resulted from longer imports of steel ordered in anticipation
of a steel strike. Steel imports in the six months, November-April,
averaged 640 thousand tons a month, more than 40 per cent higher than
in the corresponding period a year earlier. Steel imports in April
were at a much higher rate.
Credit conditions and interest rates in Europe. During the
first half of 1965, long-term bond yields rose in a number of European
countries -- markedly in Germany, Britain, and the Netherlands; and to
a lesser degree in France. Demand for long-term funds on the Continent
has been strong, by public authorities as well as private borrowers.
Upward movements in rates, there and also in Britain, have been
regarded as generally consistent with national policies concerned with
resisting inflation or restoring payments equilibrium. In Germany,
earlier efforts to restrain the rise in bond yields had to be given up
in May.
In Italy, where national policy since mid-1964 has been strongly
oriented toward revival of economic activity, long-term interest rates
declined further in the first half of 1965. In Belgium, yields have
been steady, at a much higher level than two years ago. In Switzerland,
bond yields eased early in 1965; a rising tendency later was successfully
resisted by the authorities.
Among the factors contributing to stiffening of short-term
as well as long-term interest rates on the Continent may have been the
slackening of previously accelerated flows of U.S. direct investment

IV -5
funds and of U.S. bank credit, and withdrawals of U.S. liquid funds
from the Euro-dollar market (largely via Canada). However, outflows
of commercial bank funds from Italy to the Euro-dollar market,
encouraged by the Bank of Italy, tended to exert a stabilizing effect
on Euro-dollar rates.
Credit conditions in Britain tightened during the first half
of the year, as the Government placed increasing emphasis on monetary
policy in dealing with the U.K. balance-of-payments problem. Bond
yields rose throughout the period.
Bank credit outstanding, seasonally adjusted, was sharply
reduced in May and was then slightly below the end-of-1964 level. What-
ever effect the November rise in bank lending rates (accompanying the
rise in Bank Rate at that time) may have had on bank credit expansion
was supplemented by the imposition in late April of special deposit
requirements for commercial banks; and in early May the Bank of England
requested the banks and other financial institutions to limit to 5
per cent the growth of their loans over the 12 months from March 1965.
Consumer credit was made tighter in early June when minimum downpayments
on hire-purchase contracts were raised 5 percentage points.
Short-term interest rates moved down after March, as the
discount houses bid actively for a diminished stock of Treasury bills
outstanding, and as local authorities pulled out of the market and
borrowed heavily from the Public Works Loan Board at the start of the
new fiscal year. Rates were reduced further when Bank Rate was cut
from 7 to 6 per cent on June 3. Three-month rate reductions from

IV -6
December 30 to June 30 were from 6.41 to 5.39 per cent on Treasury
bills; from 7-3/4 to 6-5/8 per cent on hire-purchase paper; and from
7-3/4 to 6-1/4 per cent on local authority deposits.
Bond yields advanced during January-April, as investors held
back. The rise accelerated in late May and June, partly, it seems,
in reflection of uncertainties about coverage of the new capital gains
tax, which has not yet been enacted. Yields on selected government
bonds rose by between 29 and 40 basis points from late December to late
June, the yield on War Loan rising from 6.47 per cent on December 31
to 6.80 per cent on June 25.
In Germany, the bond market came under increasing pressure
this spring because of a heavier volume of new issues and rising short-
term rates; the U.S. balance-of-payments program may also have been a
factor. Earlier, the Bundesbank raised its discount rate on January 22
from 3 to 3-1/2 per cent, after money market rates had for some time
been above the discount rate. Since then the rate for 90-day interbank
loans has moved up further by 1/2 of 1 per cent.
Various public authorities had been supporting the bond market
ever since March 1964, when the 25 per cent withholding tax on interest
paid to foreigners was first proposed, but during 1965 the support
prices were progressively lowered in the face of market sales. The
composite yield on 6 per cent public authority bonds accordingly moved
up from 6.43 per cent at the end of December to 6.70 per cent on May 4.
On May 5, market pressures became so great that it was decided to
suspend support operations; since then yields have moved to 7.3 per cent,

IV -7
where they appear to have stabilized. New issues, carrying a 7 per cent
coupon for the first time since 1958 and priced to yield 7.2 per cent,
are currently readily absorbed by the market.
In the Netherlands, interest rates have been under upward
pressure ever since the central bank began to take restrictive actions
to counter the "wage explosion" of the fall of 1963. Short-term rates,
as reflected by 3-month Treasury bill yields, moved up further from an
average of 3.68 per cent in December 1964 to 4.13 per cent in mid-June.
Tightening of financial conditions pushed yields on perpetual
Government bonds from 4.98 per cent last December to 5.24 per cent in
mid-June. Coupons of new loans by private issuers, which at 6 per cent
had already been unusually high, moved to 6-1/4 per cent. The capital
market is expected to tighten further as the Central Government and
local authorities seek additional funds.
In France, the authorities have acted to lower money market
rates and the cost of bank credit, but bond yields have risen. New
bond issues in January-April ran 11 per cent above a year earlier,
mainly because of heavier offerings by the public credit institutions
and the nationalized enterprises. Yields on public sector bonds rose
gradually by 10 basis points to 5.80 per cent in mid-June; corporate
yields were steady in the first quarter but have since advanced 20
basis points to 6.45 per cent in mid-June. (These yields are net of
a 10 per cent withholding tax.)
In view of the year-long sluggishness in domestic economic
activity, on April 8 the Bank of France reduced the basis discount rate

IV -8
from 4 to 3-1/2 per cent and the first penalty rate from 5 to 4-1/2
per cent, and money market rates fell to an average of 4 per cent in
April, as compared to 4.4 per cent in March. A rise to about 4.5 per
cent in June was largely seasonal. To offset seasonal tightness in
May-June, bank liquid asset requirements were eased. The minimum
lending rates applicable to the various types of bank credit were
reduced by 0.15 to 0.25 percentage points in January and by a further
0.10 to 0.35 percentage points in April.
On June 23, consumer credit regulations were eased in a
further move to stimulate the economy. The fixed limit of 10 per cent
per year on bank credit expansion was removed on July 1, but no early
upsurge in credit extension is expected.
In Italy, in sharp contrast with Britain and Germany, a decline
in bond yields dating from June 1964 continued in the first four months
of 1965. Bank credit remained in abundant supply.
The composite yield on bonds of corporations and the public
credit institutions dropped sharply from 6.90 per cent in December
(monthly average) to 6.76 per cent in January, and declined slightly
further to 6.71 per cent in May. (Yields in May were 7.26 per cent on
corporate bonds; 6.89 per cent on bonds of public credit institutions
which finance industry and public works; and 6.18 per cent on bonds of
public credit institutions which extend real estate and farm credit.)
Yields on government bonds, of which the amount outstanding is small
relative to other types, dropped from 5.62 per cent in December to

IV -9
5.35 per cent in January, held steady in February-March, and rose to
5.49 per cent in May.
The decline in bond yields since mid-1964 reflects a high
degree of liquidity in the Italian banking system, occasioned mainly
by the surplus position of the balance of payments and also by rising
Bank of Italy credit to the Treasury. The banks have employed
additional reserve funds to retire credit from the central bank, to
decrease their net liabilities to the Euro-dollar market, and to build
up free reserves. They have also increased their loans somewhat, and
they have added substantially to bond holdings.
Money market conditions in Switzerland early in the year
were described as very easy because of the large foreign exchange inflows
of late 1964 associated with the sterling crisis. The decline in the
3-month deposit rate from 3.70 to 3.06 per cent during January was sharper
than usual. (To mop up liquidity, in January the Swiss National Bank
swapped $110 million of foreign exchange to Swiss commercial banks.)
After the marked tightening of the Euro-dollar market in March, Swiss
banks apparently moved funds into that market. Also, U.S. corporation
subsidiaries began to seek more credit from Swiss banks. Developments
such as these raised the 3-month deposit rate to 3.44 per cent on
May 21, and preparations for mid-year window dressing were an added
factor in a further increase to 3.69 per cent on June 18.
The bond market came under pressure in May and June as the
volume of new flotations continued to mount. After a rise of about
4 basis points in government bonds in early May, the Swiss National Bank

IV -10
reportedly bagan to intervene to stabilize the market. To avoid
upward pressure on rates, the Treasury decided to redeem in cash part
of a long-term issue maturing in June, and a portion of its refinancing
was done with medium-term notes.
Credit conditions in Japan. With the aim of stimulating
domestic economic activity, the Bank of Japan reduced its discount rate
to 5.48 per cent on June 26, the lowest it has been since October 1951.
Successive reductions since last December have been accompanied by
actions to make reserve funds more readily available to the banks and
to relax previous restrictions on bank lending policies, but the banks
appear to have been acting cautiously in their lending operations.
The discount rate has now been lowered by more than 1 percentage point
since December, and the call loan rate has been brought down from 11.3
per cent to 6.6 per cent.
Continued weakness in the Japanese stock market and a persist-
ing overhang of inventories of finished goods have contributed to lack
of confidence in the domestic economic outlook. The trade balance has
been an element of strength in the balance of payments. The rapid rise
in exports that began early in 1964 has continued in recent months,
helped by active selling efforts of Japanese producers. Despite net
outflows of long-term capital in March and April, and a moderate loss
of reserves in the second quarter, the Japanese authorities describe
the payments position as relatively satisfactory.

APPENDIX A: PRESENT STATE OF THE 1965 SOCIAL SECURITY AMENDMENTS*
The Senate Finance Committee reported out the 1965 Social Security
Amendments on June 28. The Committee report was released on June 30
and it is expected that the Senate will take up the bill during the week
of July 9. It is also expected that the Senate will pass the bill with
only very minor changes from the way it was reported out.
The bill as passed by the House and as reported by the Senate
Finance Committee provides for medicare for the aged, increased social
security benefits and increased social security taxes. However, thereare
two major differences (and numerous smaller ones) between the House and
Senate versions. Consequently, the bill will have to go to conference but final
passage is ' expected around July 15.
The estimatedcost of the program is shown in Table 1 and the
estimated timing of the increased expenditures by calendar and fiscal years
is shown in Table 2. The increase in social security benefits is to be
effective immediately. However, benefits under medicare are not to become
effective until July 1, 1966.

A -2
The Kerr-Mills plans which established,several years ago,
separate Federal-State aid programs for meeting the medical expenses
of the needy are to be absorbed into the general Medicare program,
resulting in somewhat higher expenditures under these programs. Inclu-
sion of these plans was not requested by the Administration but was
included by both Houses.
The major difference between the House and Senate versions
with respect to expenditures is that the Senate bill raises the ceiling
on the amount a person can earn without reducing benefits from $1,200 a
year to $1,800.
The increased expenditures are to be financed by increased
social security taxes to be effective January 1, 1966. The House
passed a tax increase which consists of raising the ceiling on the amount
of wages and salaries subject to tax from the present $4,800 to $5,600
and raising the combined employer-employee tax rate from tIe current
7.25 per cent to 8.7 per cent. The bill reported by the Senate Finance
Committee increases the wage ceiling to $6,600 and raises the rate to
8.35 per cent. The House bill has a future increase in the wage ceiling
built into it and both have preplanned increases in the tax rate as
can be seen in Table 3.

Suposedly the alternate tax plans would yield the same increase
in revenue--an estimated $5.4 billion at annual rates. Of this $5.4 bil-
lion, a $2.2 billion increase in social security taxes had been previously
legislated to be effective January 1966. The new base and higher rate
would add, at least, an additional $3.2 billion in revenue. It appears
likely, however, that if the Senate's tax program is the one finally
passed, the $6,600 wage ceiling and 8.35 per cent tax rate would yield
larger revenues--by about $600 million--than the smaller base and higher
rate. The inrease in taxes being scheduled for January 1 is, therefore,
somewhere between $5.4 and $6.0 billion, depending on which tax program
is enacted.

B-1
APPENDIX : SCHEDULED EXCISE TAX CTS AND IUDGETARY OUTLOOK*
As indicated in Table 1, most of the excise tax cuts take
place in fiscal 1966. About $1.8 billion of such reductions (at an
annual rate) have already taken place, including a 3 percentage point
reduction in auto excises. A further $1.7 billion is scheduled for
January 1, 1966, which includes 1 percentage point further on autos
together with elimination of taxes on auto parts; also telephone taxes
are substantially reduced. Subsequent excise reductions represent the
gradual elimination of telephone and auto taxes (except for a residual
1 per cent retained on autos).
Table 2 shows the effect of the excise tax cut, together with
the new social security program described in Appendix A, on various
measures of the Federal budget. As these programs take effect in the
third quarter of this year, all budgets are projected to be in deficit,
while the full employment surplus drops to just under $1 billion, the
lowest level since the first stage of the recent income tax cut in the
second quarter of 1964. Relatively little change, seasonally adjusted,
is projected for the fourth quarter, but the budgets become less expan-
sionary in the first half of 1966 when new social security taxes become
effective.

APPENDIX C: PRIC CHANGES DURING THE CUIRET BUSINESS EXPANSION*
The all-commodity index of wholesale prices has risen 2 per
cent since last summer after 7 years of stability. (Chart l.)# Nore
than half the rise is accounted for by sharp increases in prices of
foodstuffs in response to curtailed supplies, but the increase in the
index for industrial commodities, although slow-paced, has been persis-
tent. (Chart 2.) Over the 9 months since the third quarter of last
year, the industrial index has increased 1.3 per cent. As the attached
table shows, this index had increased only 0.5 per cent over the preceding
year and a half, from the first quarter of 1963 to the third quarter of
last year, and had declined 0.7 per cent in the first 2 years of this
business expansion,
Sharp increases in prices of foodstuffs, to a point 5 per cent
higher than last summer, reflect delays in harvesting vegetables because
of unfavorable weather and, more importantly, reduced marketings of live-
stock in response to low prices last year. Government surveys of
farmers' production plans indicate that reduced output and higher prices
for livestock will continue for some months to come. The last comparable
shift in the livestock situation occurred in 1957, and prices rose
sharply to a peak in the spring of 1958 when the recession in business
activity reached its low. (The last Chart, numbered 14.)
Increases in food prices contributed to raising the consumer
price index 0.6 per cent from March to lay, and further increases are
likely. As a consequence, wages will be pushed up in those industries
that have cost-of-living clauses in their labor contracts. About 2
million workers presently are covered by such clauses--about half as
many as the high at the end of 1958.
Prices of foodstuffs tend to be dominated by changes in
supplies--reflecting variations in the weather or swings in the live-
stock production cycles--and are much less sensitive to cyclical changes
in incomes and demands. In time, moreover, the supply and price changes
tend to be self-correcting. This memorandum, therefore, will focus on
markets for industrial commodities.

C -2
Early 1961 to early 1963
In the first 2 years of this expansion period, downward
pressure was maintained on prices in many markets for industrial
commodities as the pace of expansion was not rapid enough to signifi-
cantly raise rates of resource utilization and alter competitive condi-
tions. In the spring and summer of 1962, moreover, expectations were
dampened by the Government-industry conflict over steel prices and by
the sharp drop in common stock prices.
A rise in prices of sensitive industrial materials, which had
begun promptly with the upturn in activity in early 1961, proved to be
short-lived. By early 1963, prior to the renewed expansion in industrial
output, the sensitive index had backed down almost to the lou of early
1961. (Chart 4.) Prices of nonferrous metals and mill products were a
little lower than in early 1961.
For industrial materials other than the sensitive, the index
declined 1.5 per cent over the first 2 years of the current business
expansion. Decreases were fairly widespread, as the table shows, and
in some instances they were sizeable. Even steel mill products declined
slightly. To some extent, decreases in this period may have reflected
downward adjustments of list or published prices to the level at which
transactions had actually been occurring for some time--to the level, in
other words, of prices after discounts and special concessions. One
price increase among these materials was for metal containers. Even at
the recession low at the beginning of 1961, container prices had been
raised 2 per cent,
Price reductions were widespread among finished products also.
Most consumer durable goods--television sets, appliances, floor coverings,
and autos--declined by significant amounts. On the other hand, house-
hold furniture rose 2 per cent in that 2-year period. The possibility
of a measurement problem for furniture is suggested by an almost steady
rise since 1958 at an average annual rate of 1 per cent. The largest
increase among finished goods was shown by nonalcoholic beverages.
An alternative and often useful way of grouping industrial
commodities, also shown in the table and in the chart numbered 10,
combines all metals and machinery in one group and all other industrial
commodities into a second group. In the first 2 years of the expansion,
both of these groups declined slightly.
Early 1963 to the summer of 1964
In early 1963, expansion in new orders for and production of
business equipment and other durable goods was resumed, and the rise in
production in other industrial countries accelerated. Consequently,

C -3
prices of metals and machinery turned up. The sensitive group for non-
ferrous metals and mill products rose nearly a tenth in the year and
a half from the first quarter of 1963 to the third quarter of 1964.
(Chart 12.) In 1963, prices of most steel mill products were raised,
and the aggregate index for mill products rose 1.5 per cent. With costs
of these basic metal products rising, prices of brass plumbing fixtures
and of structural metal products also increased, and metal containers
were raised again. Altogether, the index for metals and machinery rose
nearly 2 per cent.
Industrial commodities other than metals and machinery on
balance declined slightly further in this period and provided a partial
offset. (Chart 10 and table.) A sharp further decrease in petroleum
products was an important part of the offset, and prices of industrial
chemicals continued to decline.
Meanwhile, woodpulp prices recovered to their early 1961 level,
although they remained about 5 per cent lower than in 1959-60, and prices
rose for some paper products but declined further for others. Ilillork
prices remained at the high reached in early 1964--6.5 per cent above a
year earlier.
Among the sensitive materials, lumber and plywood rose, but
the increase of 4 per cent was not especially large for these commodi-
ties. (Charts 6, 7, and 3.) In the upswing from the recession low in
early 1958, for e:ample, they rose about a tenth. lioreover, a decline
in their prices was underway in the summer of 1964 in response to a
weakening in residential construction activity.
Among finished consumer products, price changes during this
period continued to be mixed, as the table shows. Television sets,
appliances, and autos declined further. Prices of floor coverings and
apparel were increased appreciably when prices of rau wool went up. The
large increase shown for nonalcoholic beverages, 8.5 per cent, was pro-
voked in 1963 by soaring prices for sugar.
Since the summer of 1964
From the third quarter of last year to June, the industrial
index increased 1.3 per cent, or an annual rate of 1.75 per cent. Metals
and machinery increased 1.6 per cent further--an annual rate of 2 per
cent compared with a rate of 1.25 per cent in the preceding period. At
the same time, offsetting decrease in prices were fewer than before. In
particular, prices of petroleum products recovered much of their earlier
decline, and the aggregate for industrial commodities other than metals
and machinery also increased in this period in contrast with its slight
decreases in the two earlier periods. (Chart 10.)

C- 4
The nonferrous metals group has risen as much since last
summer, as it had in the preceding year and a half, and was again the
major influence behind a 3 per cent rise in the index for sensitive
materials. Apparently with competitive positions in mind, producers
of copper had held prices down earlier in 1964 despite strikes and
other interruptions to supplies and large increases in prices on the
London and New York exchanges. But last autumn and again this spring,
producers responded to pressures from both the markets and the Chilean
Government by raising prices a total of more than 10 per cent, and
increases for mill products followed. Also, in this period, demands for
aluminum products expanded sufficiently so that attempts to increase
prices from reduced levels, after having failed several times before,
finally succeeded. Higher prices for copper and aluminum were reflected
in further increases for plumbing fixtures and structural metal products.
The sensitive textile group changed little in this period, but
in a sense prices of textile mill products are inflated. (Chart 7.)
Market prices of natural fibers are down sharply from a year ago, mainly
as a result of a 7.5 per cent reduction last year in Federal price-
supports for cotton. In addition, enactment of "one price cotton"
legislation further reduced the cost of cotton for domestic use by about
a fifth. Prices of cotton textile mill products have increased somewhat
since last summer, however, and are only slightly below their levels
prior to the reduction in the cost of raw cotton. Demands for cotton
textiles have been strong, and while employment costs have increased,
profit margins have widened appreciably.
In the recent period, the index for industrial materials
other than the sensitive rose 1 per cent, in contrast with no change
in the preceding period and a decrease in the first 2 years of expansion.
Petroleum products rose 5 per cent, after having fallen 12 per cent from
early 1961, and this partial recovery exerted an important influence on
the aggregate index for nonsensitive materials--and also on the index for
consumer nonfood products. The decline in industrial chemicals was
arrested, and woodpulp rose further but paper products changed little.
Increases were effected for selected steel mill products, but prices
were stable for most mill products and the increase in the average was
small. Prices of metal containers were raised once again, and producers
attributed the action to increased labor costs.
Among finished products, the further rise in machinery and
equipment and partial recovery in trucks and in tires and tubes shown
in the table are probably attributable to the strength of demands.
Ueanwhile, televison sets and appliances continued downward, and
accompanying a decrease in raw wool, floor coverings declined somewhat.
On balance, wholesale prices of consumer nonfood products increased
slightly. (Chart 9.)

C-5
Comparing the latest figures for the groups of industrial
commodities with their levels in early 1960, prior to the last
recession, only the producers' equipment is up by a statistically
significant amount. It is possible that a part of the 3 per cent rise
in that 5-year period reflected improvements in efficiency of equipment
not fully allowed for in the figures.
Ilost groups of industrial materials remain below their early
1960 levels, as the table shows, with nonferrous metals and metal
containers the principal exceptions. Labor costs per unit of manufac-
turing output (including output of both industrial products and
industrial materials) are down 3 per cent from 5 years ago.
Among consumer goods, the large increases are for beverages
and tobacco. Furniture is also higher, and apparel and footwear are
up about 2 per cent. But most other groups of consumer goods are lower
than they were 5 years ago, and appliances and television sets are down
substantially.
For the most part, price increases during the current business
expansion are a consequence of strong demands. The rise in prices of
nonferrous metals and mill products alone accounts directly for two-
fifths of the increase in the total industrial index since early 1963,
and prices of these demand-sensitive commodities typically show large
cyclical swings. Increases in machinery prices also are attributable
mainly to strong demands and an accumulation of order backlogs. Hourly
employment costs in some machinery industries, according to industry
comments, have exceeded gains in output per manhour, in part because
of overtime operations. But if labor costs have increased for these
industries, costs probably have declined for others since total labor
costs per unit of output in manufacturing have drifted downward.
For some products, upward pressure on prices has arisen from
the cost of materials. The rise in nonferrous metals increased manu-
facturing costs for batteries, plumbing fixtures, and some other products.
Prices of nonalcoholic beverages were raised sharply when sugar prices
soared, although the beverages have not come down again despite the
retreat in sugar prices. Prices of apparel and floor coverings were
raised when prices for wool went up. Increases in costs arising from
wages and purchased materials have been selective, however, rather than
pervasive, and therefore they have not been part of a cumulative inter-
action of prices and costs. It is significant that prices of steel
mill products currently are only 1 per cent higher than in early 1960;
from the end of 1953 through 1958, steel prices were raised a third.
That upward pressure have not been diffused through the
structure of prices and costs is a fact that has favorable implications
for future price developments, assuming that the pace of expansion in

C- 6
demands does not soon again accelerate to a rapid rate. Current or
prospective increases in supplies of goods andin capacity to produce
combined with only moderate expansion in demands--or contraction in those
instances where temporary inventory demands have been important--might
serve to moderate such price pressures as have existed. A downturn in
economic activity probably would be accompanied promptly by a reversal
in the direction of the industrial price inde:, in contrast with
experience in the 1957-58 recession, since the substantial rise in
prices of nonferrous metals and mill products would be quickly liquidated,
prices of textiles and other sensitive materials probably would decline,
and the structure of costs does not appear to have been raised generally,
