IN BROAD REVIEW
Expansion in production and employment has continued lately,
though not at such a rapid pace as early in the year. A downward adjust-
ment in steel output in prospect after Iay 1 was deferred by extension
of the strike deadline to September 1, and meanwhile increasing military
commitments in Vietnam, though not immediately large in terms of total
economic activity, have tended to strengthen the view that expansion will
continue for some time yet. Inventory accumulation, which has continued
at a high rate, is widely expected to be at a more moderate pace later
in the year. Capital goods outlays, which have been an increasingly
important feature of the expansion in activity, are generally expected
to continue upward. Consumer spending was strong in July. Personal
incomes will be augmented early this autumn by a retroactive increase
in social security benefits.
Commodity price changes have continued to be highly selective
in recent months, although from mid-Iiarch to mid-June the broad averages
of prices rose appreciably, reflecting, in wholesale markets, some further
increase in industrial prices but mainly a sharp runup in prices of
livestock and meats. Since mid-June livestock prices have eased a little.
Initial upward pressures in speculative markets in response to developments
in Vietnam proved to be largely temporary, apart from copper markets.
Corporate profits continued unusually high in the second quarter.
Higher after-tax earnings this year are partly attributable to the cut
in income tax rates, but profit margins also have been very well
maintained on this year's larger volume of sales.

I- 2
Security markets have quieted recently, despite uncertainties
concerning Vietnam. Stock prices have fluctuated narrowly over the past
month on reduced trading volume, remaining about 6 per cent below the
mid-May high. Yields on corporate and municipal bonds have dropped back
a few basis points, reflecting easing of earlier congestion in new
issue markets, while yields on longer-term Treasury bonds have increased
slightly to about the year's high. Market reception of the August re-
funding appears satisfactory; partly reflecting anticipation and announce-
ment of the refunding, bill yields declined in the latter part of July,
but in recent days they have firmed somewhat.
Total bank credit seems likely to show little change for the
month of July, following the very large June expansion. This difference
is largely due to the extension of temporary credits of various kinds
toward the end of June, however, and underlying loan trends appear to have
been
continued strong. Recently there appears to have/a shifting in the locus
of business loan demands from the New York City banks, where increases
were very large earlier in the year, to banks in the other centers.
The money supply rose at a 6 per cent annual rate in July, on
a daily average basis, following the very large June expansion. A
reduction in the Treasury cash balance, which 1was only of about seasonal
proportions, did not contribute to last month's rise in public money
holdings, but a further reduction in the Treasury balance in August is
expected to work in this direction. Time deposits also rose in July,

I -3
at a somewhat faster rate than in other recent months; increases in
individuals' deposit balances probably accounted for the larger rise,
since the amount of OD's outstanding declined in New York City while
rising at the outlying reporting banks.
The U.S. balance of payments appears to have remained in
surplus in July after allowance for seasonal influences. Trade
figures for June provide further evidence of a deterioration in the
trade surplus since last autumn.

THE DOMESTIC ECONOMY
Prices. Prices for basic commodities, particularly in markets
for futures, rose moderately during the period of high-level U.S. con-
sultations on increased military activity in Vietnam. Prices of copper,
already in short supply, approached earlier highs in both the New York and
London markets. Follouing the President's announcement of decisions,
however, prices generally eased somewhat as the size of the increase in
defense spending apparently was below the common expectations.
The general wholesale price index has edged down since mid-June
following its rise of 1.5 per cent from mid-March. Foodstuffs, which
account for most of this year's rise in the total, reached a peak in late
June and then declined somewhat reflecting similar behavior on the part
of livestock and meats. Industrial prices rose only 0.1 per cent from
mid-May to mid-June, with producers' equipment up slightly further while
consumer goods and industrial materials were unchanged. The index apparently
edged up 0.1 per cent further to late July, and at 102.2 per cent of the
1957-59 average, it is now about 1.5 per cent higher than last summer.
The consumer price index rose 0.5 per cent further in June, and
the increase through the second quarter -- from March -- amounted to 1.0
per cent. To an even greater extent than in April and May, the rise in
June reflected increases for foods. Retail prices of meats rose sharply --
by 7 per cent. Fresh fruits and vegetables rose 6 per cent further, and
the total for foods increased 2 per cent. All items less foods averaged
unchanged as services increased only a little and nonfood commodities

II -2
declined slightly. The first price decreases attributable to the excise
tax reductions appeared as new car prices fell 2.8 per cent and, owing
mainly to elimination of the tax on air conditioners, the index for
household durable goods declined 0.5 per cent.
Industrial production. The industrial production index, which
rose 0.5 point further in June -- with the rise largely accounted for
by an increase in materials -- apparently rose further in July. Limited
data suggest that output of business and defense equipment increased while
auto assemblies held close to the June annual rate of 9.5 million units,
increasing dealer inventories further. Steel production showed much less
than the usual seasonal decrease, and the seasonally adjusted index for
steel was up appreciably from the second quarter level, with some output
still going with inventory.
In the second quarter the pace of expansion in industrial output
slowed to an annual rate of about 4 per cent, about half the rate in the
preceding year and a quarter. Continued rapid expansion in output of
equipment provided the main upward momentum. The increase in business
equipment production in June was very small, but it followed a fairly
large increase in May, and for the quarter as a whole, the earlier rate
of increase was maintained. Prospects appear favorable for a sustained
high level or further increase; both new and unfilled orders for machinery
and equipment were up appreciably further in the second quarter. Pro-
duction of ordnance and some other defense equipment apparently rose
following a one-month bulge in new orders in April.
Output of consumer goods has shown little net change since
early in the year. Auto assemblies in May and June were moderately

II -3
below the March peak and unchanged from the first quarter average.
Production of appliances and some other home goods also was down from
a March peak but about the same as in January and February. Apparel
production was virtually stable through the first half of the year. Even
production of consumer staples changed little through that period.
Output of materials rose further during the second quarter,
mainly as a consequence of increases in equipment parts and steel.
Production of such basic materials as textiles, paper, chemicals, petroleum
products, and clay and glass products showed little change.

Personal income and spending. Personal income rose $4 billion
in June to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $524 billion, 7 per cent
higher than a year earlier. A further moderately large gain in wages and
salaries and sharp rises in farm proprietors' income and corporate divi-
dend payments accounted for nearly all of the June advance.

II -4
Half of the June rise was in wages and salaries, with increases
widespread. Farm proprietors' income rose sharply to the highest level
since 1952, reflecting mainly a rapid rise in livestock prices. The
jump in dividends was due mainly to an extra dividend payment by a
major auto producer.
Retail sales declined slightly in June despite the substantial
rise in personal income. The decline was primarily at general merchandise
stores; dollar sales at food stores increased, partly because of higher
prices.
In the second quarter personal consumption expenditures rose
only $5 billion following an unusually large increase of $11.6 billion in
the first quarter. Spending for nondurable goods and services increased
somewhat more than in the first quarter, but spending for autos and parts
fell short of the first quarter total as automobile buying declined from
the phenomenal first quarter rate. Consumption expenditures rose less
than disposable personal income and the spending rate declined from the
unexpectedly high 93.3 per cent rate of the first quarter to a more
usual rate of 92.9 per cent.
In July retail sales rose about 1-1/2 per cent to a new high,
according to a preliminary estimate based on data for four xeeks. Sales
at nondurable goods stores on balance were up a little with moderate gains
for most types of stores. Sales at durable goods stores were up about 2
per cent, with automotive stores and furniture and appliance stores showing
unusual strength.

II -5
Auto sales and stocks. Sales of new domestic autos in the first
20 days of July were equal to a month earlier, after allowance for normal
seasonal decline, and 16 per cent above a year ago. If this pace continued
through the month, July's seasonal adjusted rate was about 8.3 million
cars per annum, down from 8.8 million in June but equal to the average
monthly rate to date in the current model year and moderately above the
April and May rates. In the last 10 days of June sales were boosted by
terminating dealer contests.
Dealer inventories of new cars on July 20 were 5 per cent higher
than at the end of June and 10 per cent above a year ago. They represent
56 days' supply at the July selling rate, an unusually high level. The
model changeover, now in progress, will be longer this year allowing more
chance to liquidate stocks.
New car prices, which normally decline moderately in this season,
dropped 2.8 per cent in June to a level 3.4 per cent below June 1964
as the excise tax was cut from 10 to 7 per cent of wholesale value.
Used car prices rose 1.3 per cent over May to their level a year ago.
Consumer credit. Despite some slowing in June, instalment credit
expanded at a little faster rate in the second quarter than in the first.
The June increase was $602 million, an annual rate of $7.2 billion. The
rate for the second quarter as a whole was $8.1 billion, up from $7.8
billion in the first quarter*

The slower tempo for June as compared with May reflected changes
in personal loans and nonauto goods credit. Auto credit was maintained
by heavy sales of both new and used cars; also, the proportion of cars
purchased on credit was somewhat larger than usual.
Personal loans in June were up $162 million, a sizable increase
by most past standards but not so large an increase as occurred either in
April, when there was heavy tax borrowing, or in May.
Noninstalment credit increased $122 million in June, with single
payment loans accounting for more than half the rise. At the end of the
month total consumer credit outstanding had reached almost $83 billion,
a level 11 per cent higher than a year earlier.
Orders for durable goods. New orders for durable goods
stabilized in June after a 5 per cent drop in May. The hay decline re-
flected large decreases for steel and defense products. In June, new
orders for defense products declined moderately further but steel orders
rose -- at least temporarily -- from the low Hay level and new orders
for most other durable goods changed little.

II -7
Unfilled orders for durable goods continued to expand in June,
with most of the rise for the month representing further grouth in
machinery backlogs. Unfilled orders for durable goods are now somewhat
higher relative to shipments than they were a year ago.
New orders for defense products bulged in April -- taking the
total for durable goods up to a neu peak -- and, despite a large decline
after April, the second quarter defense total was considerably above the
first quarter. This large rise in defense orders -- and a more moderate
further gain in new orders for machinery and equipment -- offset a sharp
drop in steel orders, and total new orders for durable goods in the
second quarter were unchanged from the first quarter.

lianufacturers' inventories. Inventory accumulation by manu-
facturers was somewhat larger in June than in earlier months this year.
The June book value increase totaled $340 million as compared with
increments averaging $265 million a month from January through Hay.
This moderate step-up came from a sizable increase in the rate
of accumulation by durable goods producers, chiefly of work-in-process
stocks. Accumulation of steel stocks by steel users slowed further,
and the book value of durable materials and supplies -- which had

II -G
increased sharply over the period of rapid accumulation of steel stocks --
showed little change in June. At steel mills, finished steel stocks re-
covered moderately further from their sharply reduced April level --
steel mills had shipped out everything they could lay their hands on just
before the IMay 1 strike deadline.
For the second quarter, the book value of manufacturers' inventory
accumulation totaled $900 million, up from $765 million in the first
quarter. Durable goods producers accounted for all that accumulation
in the second quarter and for 3/4 of the first quarter rise; and
accumulation of steel stocks -- now coming to an end -- was a major
factor in both quarters.
Residential building. Seasonally adjusted private housing
starts, which had dipped in Hay, turned slightly upward again in June.
At 1.53 million, including farm starts, the annual rate was the same as
for the second quarter as a whole. This was 4 per cent above the recent
low reached in the first quarter and just under the average for all of
1964.
While starts in the North Central states accounted for most of
the second quarter rise, starts in the Northeast and South also showed
some increase and the rate in the strategically important West was
unchanged after more than a year of continuing decline.
In the nation as a whole, seasonally adjusted building permits
changed little in June from the upward revised rate for May. Permits
for single family buildings declined somewhat, but multifamily permits

II -9
recovered further and, while still well below earlier highs, were up
appreciably from the recent low of last December.

Rental vacancies edged down in the second quarter of the
year to 7.5 per cent of units available and fit for use. The average
was only slightly higher than a year earlier and compared with a post-
war peak of 8.1 per cent in the second quarter of 1961. The second
quarter dip reflected mainly a decline within metropolitan areas to nearly
the year earlier average -- 7.2 per cent. Outside such areas, the
average rose, but the rise appeared to be less than seasonal.
Uithin individual regions, shifts from the first to second
quarter tended in part to reflect seasonal influences. However, average
vacancy rates in the Northeast and particularly the West continued
unusually high in relation to earlier levels for those regions. In the
South and North Central states, on the other hand, the second quarter
rates were the lowest in recent years.
Last week, the $7.5 billion omnibus housing bill was sent
to the President. The bill extends for four years all basic FHA programs

II -10
and introduces a number of innovations, including a new land-development
loan program, a new veterans' preference program for cold war dischargees
and a rent subsidy program for those eligible for public housing. It
will probably be some time before the impact of these innovations on
housing developments will be felt directly.
Labor market. Employment in nonfarm establishments increased
substantially further in June, and at 60.3 million, seasonally adjusted,
was 2.2 million higher than a year earlier. An increase of 200,030 in
June followed a rise of about the sane amount in May. Manufacturing
accounted for nearly half of the rise and the increase there was again
largely concentrated in the metals and metal-using industries. In
addition, the usual large gains occurred in services and State and local
government.
The increase in nonfarm jobs since December has been substantial --
in excess of a million. Factory jobs increased nearly 400,000, more than
twice as much as in the first six months of last year, to 18.3 million.
The sharper rise reflected stronger demands for consumer durables --
mainly automobiles -- and for capital equipment. Employment in defense
industries also shoned an increase, in contrast to the cutback in the
first half of last year. Nondurable goods employment increased moderately
both this year and last.
Outside manufacturing, trade and State and local government
employment advanced more sharply this year. In construction, on the other
hand, employment in June was 30,000 belo: year-end, whereas it had risen

in the comparable period a year earlier. Construction employment in
June was nevertheless 100,000 above the level a year ago,

Labor costs. Labor costs per unit of output in manufacturing
edged up again in June and the second quarter average was a little above
the initial quarter; it was still slightly below a year ago. The
small first to second quarter increase in costs primarily reflected con-
tinuing increases in total compensation per man-hour in a period of less
rapid increase in manufacturing output and productivity.
Labor market areas. In June, 7 of the 150 major labor market
areas were shifted to lower unemployment-rate categories, reflecting
recent gains in employment, especially in durable goods. Four of these

II -12
areas moved into the 1.5 to 2.9 per cent unemployment rate class,
bringing the number of major markets in this category to 40, the largest
number since July 1957 and double the number a year earlier,
Major areas with 6 per cent or more of the labor force unemployed
numbered 21 in June, 16 fewer than a year earlier and less than at any
other time since early 1957. The 19 areas still classified in the 6 to
9 per cent unemployed category include 7 primarily coal mining areas
in Appalachia, 4 chiefly textile areas in Massachusetts, 5 mainly defense
areas in California, and 3 other widely dispersed areas. Two areas in
Puerto Rico remained in the very substantial labor surplus category with
unemployment rates of more than 12 per cent.
Gross national product. Gross national product rose $9 billion
in the second quarter to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $658 billion,
according to Commerce preliminary estimates. In terms of constant
prices this was 4.5 per cent higher than a year earlier. The second quarter
rise, although substantially less than the $14 billion increase in the
first quarter, was larger than had been generally expected.
A notable feature of the second quarter was a $1.6 billion
increase reported for Federal Government purchases of goods and services,
after three quarters of decline. This rise stemmed largely from an
estimated $1 billion advance in the rate of defense spending -- partly
reflecting Vietnam, particularly in June -- and from an increase in CCC
spending.

II -13
Total private domestic investment was little changed, Residential
construction outlays were unchanged from the first quarter, while business
spending for construction was up sharply because of increased industrial
and commercial building. Outlays for producers' durable equipment were
off slightly due to reduced automobile buying by businesses. The reported
increase in business inventories -- at a $5.7 billion annual rate, with
farm stocks down slightly -- was substantial but about $1 billion less
than in the first quarter.
Personal consumption expenditures, as already noted were up
only about $5 billion in the second quarter; they were at a rate $27
billion or 7 per cent above the second quarter of last year.
Net exports, rebounding from the effects of the dock strike
in the first quarter, were estimated to be $2 billion higher in the second
quarter. State and local government outlays for goods and services in-
creased only moderately.
Farm income. Rising prices received for meat animals in
April, May, and June raised farm income prospects for 1965. Realized net
income for the second quarter was estimated at a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of $15.0 billion, up $2.4 billion from the first quarter and
$2.0 billion from the second quarter a year ago. The increase in gross
receipts outpaced that in production expenses. With prospects for con-
tinued strength in meat animal prices and for relatively stable crop
prices and a harvest larger than in 1964, realized net farm income in
1965 may turn out to be the highest since the $13.7 billion of 1953. In
the last 4 years realized net income has ranged from $12.5 to $12.9 billion.

II -14
In the second quarter, increases in cash receipts and govern-
ment payments both contributed to a 7 per cent gain in gross realized
income over a year earlier. Gains in cash receipts from sales of live-
stock and products reflected higher prices. Hleat animal prices were a
fifth above the lo; second quarter prices of 1964 while meat production
was 6 per cent less. Dairy and poultry product prices were moderately
higher even though marketings were also a little higher. For crops,
prices in the second quarter were about equal to a year ago and volume
of marketings was 6 per cent larger. Larger government payments re-
flected increased participation in the feed grain and cotton acreage
retirement programs and an increase in the proportion of the price support
on wheat that is made through payments.
Production e:penses in the second quarter were somewhat higher
than a year earlier. Feed prices were up a little and purchased live-
stock prices were sharply higher than a year ago. The long-run up-
trend in overhead costs continued.
Livestock situation. Cattle feeding rurned up in May and June
in response to the profitable feeding margins this year following tuo
unprofitable years. Placements of cattle on feed during the second quarter
a fourth larger than a year earlier brought the inventory of cattle on
feed to 7.5 million head, 9 per cent more than in mid-1964. Production
of fed beef is expected to stay above year-earlier levels through out
the remainder of 1965. Prices are also likely to be well above year-
earlier levels reflecting income gains, population growth, and smaller
pork supplies.

II -15
All evidence points to a continuation this fall of the decline
in hog production underway since the spring of 1964. The combined
spring and fall pig crops of 1965 are indicated to be 9 per cent below
1964 and 15 per cent below 1963. Pork production during the remainder
of 1965 will probably be 10 per cent below year-earlier levels. Hog
prices are expected to decline seasonally this fall but only to levels
well above those of last fall. If producers respond to favorable price
ratios as in the past, expansion in hog production may begin in 1966.
Broiler production has increased sharply in recent weeks. The
very large expansion has prompted the Department of Agriculture to
warn this industry against overexpansion.
Expansion in cattle feeding may be the major cause of a recent
acceleration in short-term debt of farmers, following a year and a half
of slackening rate of expansion. Outstanding loans of PCA's for the
country have shown a more rapid rate of increase since March; in the
Corn Belt acceleration began earlier and was larger.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL SITUATION
Bank credit. A significant seasonally adjusted August expansion
of bank credit seems in prospect, although the rise is likely to be less
than the extraordinary increase of August a year ago. Loans and invest-
ments of weekly reporting member banks showed a contraseasonal rise
of $550 million during the first two weeks of August.
Continued marked increases in loan portfolios were the chief feature
of the credit expansion at reporting banks, Government security
holdings declined, but total investments changed little -- as holdings
of municipals and other securities registered an offsetting gain.
(Purchases of other securities were heaviest at banks outside New York
City, where savings accounts and other time deposits rose rapidly.)
Though the growth of total loans over the two veeks was no larger than
last year, it was substantially greater than in the comparable period
of most earlier years.
As in other recent months, the major source of the rise in
loan volume during early August was heavy business credit demands.
Manufacturers of durable goods continued to add large amounts to their
indebtedness to banks, and wholesale trade firms also were heavy borrowers.
Increasing outlays for inventories and fixed capital, which have in-
creased external financing requirements of firms in these industries
throughout 1965, may thus be continuing in August.
In meeting demands for loan accommodation by business and
other customers this year, banks have cut deeply into their portfolios

III -2
So far in July, mosc industrial categories of business loans
have shown less than seasonal declines. As in June, however, loans to
metal and metal products firms showed no particular strength and commod-
ity dealer loans declined more than seasonally.
Real estate and consumer and other loans at weekly reporters
during this period grew about the same as in the comparable period
last year.
Over the firsc three ueeks in July, nearly all of the rela-
tively heavy liquidation of T:easury securicies by reporting banks was
accounted for by those outside of 7leu York; these banks recently have
had heavie: business loan demands and a smaller runoff in financial
loans. On the other hand, holdings of other securities continued to
increase by about equal amounts in lew York and other banks. There is
some indicaLion that the June-July increase, at least in Neu York,
represents a temporary commitment of funds pending the anticipated in-
crease in loan demand this fall.
ilonev supply and time deposits. Growth in the seasonally ad-
justed money stock moderated in July to an estimated annual rate of about
6 per cent. The July expansion brought the increase in the money stock
since the first of the year to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
3.1 per cent.
The July expansion in the privately held money stock did not
receive significant support from the rundown in Treasury deposits, since
this has been about seasonal since midyear. It is likely, however, that
a further decline of Treasury balances will contribute to grouth in the
seasonally adjusted money stock in August.

III -3
Time deposit growth accelerated last month to an estimated an-
nual rate of over 14 per cent, the highest since February. Most of the
pickup probably occurred in deposits of individuals, since expansion of
CD's at reporting banks was not as large as in other recent months.
New York City banks, in particular, have recently been less aggressive
in seeking such deposits and their outstandings have remained below
their mid-June peak.
Banks outside of New York, facing heavier loan demand, increased
their outstanding CD's by over $175 million the first three weeks of
July. The level of CD's outstanding at these banks has grown $530
million since mid-June, after several months of stability. The greater
success of outlying banks in the CD market probably reflects the slower
pace of CD sales by New York City banks, a situation which could be
reversed again if New York City banks become more aggressive CD issuers
in the fall.
Bank reserves. During July, weekly net borrowed reserves of
member banks fluctuated over a wider range than in June but averaged
1/about the same--a little under $180 million.- Borrowings and excess
reserves both averaged about the same as in June.
The effective rate on Federal funds was 4-1/8 per cent on 12
of the 19 trading days during the July reserve period, and 4 per cent
on all but one of the remaining days.
1/ Based on average of daily figures for all reserve weeks ending in
the month, as used in the reserve memorandum to the FOMC.

Corporate and municipal bond markets. Congestion evident
in corporate and municipal bond markets earlier this summer has eased
in recent weeks. The yield series on new issues of corporate bonds,
which had turned down slightly in late June, has since stabilized at
a level about 2 basis points below its mid-June peak of 4.60 per cent.
And yields on seasoned municipal bonds have edged off several basis
points since early July.

The supply of new corporate bonds expected to reach the
market in the weeks remaining to Labor Day is down substantially from
the heavy volume of new offerings witnessed in the spring and early
summer. But volume scheduled for August is still rather large for late
summer, and investors have tended to resist buying new issues being
reoffered at yields on the low side of prevailing averages. In instances
where investor resistance has developed, underwriters have nevertheless

III -5
achieved ready distribution of their remaining holdings, by making only
minor upward yield adjustments. Unsold syndicate balances are conse-
quently quite moderate.

issues.
In the municipal bond market easing of earlier congestion has
reflected a sharp and partly seasonal cutback in the immediate volume of
neu offerings from the unusually large July total, and a moderate reduc-
tion in dealer's advertised inventories below the record early June level
of $900 million. This latter liquidation was accomplished only after a
substantial markup in yields on older issues, however, and inventories
still total nearly $750 million.
Corporate profits. Corporate profits before taxes, which reached
an all-time peak of $64.3 billion (seasonally adjusted annual rate) in
the first quarter of this year, probably remained at just about this same
rate in the second quarter, though total manufacturing earnings may have
declined slightly.

III -6
Data now available on profits after taxes of ove: 600 large
companies show moderate to large increases in almost every manufacturing
industry. For manufacturing as a whole, after-tax profits appear to
have been about 17 per cent larger than in the second quarter of last
year. This follows a year-to-year rise of 22 per cent in the first
quarter. One element in these increases, of course, is the further cut
in Federal income tax rates this year.
A 17 per cent increase in after-tax profits of manufacturing
companies would suggest a year-to-year rise of about 13 per cent in
their before-tax profits. This is slightly smaller than the seasonally
adjusted rise that had already occurred between the second quarter of
last year and the first quarter of this year, but the implied decline
from first to second quarter this year is much less than many had pro-
jected. Such data as are available suggest that the better-than-expected
performance of manufacturing profits reflected some further increases in
profit margins accompanying the larger-than-projected volume of busi-
ness done.
Stock market developments. Stock prices during the past month
have fluctuated in a narrow range, showing no significant net change.
At Tuesday's close of 35.46, Standard and Poor's index of 500 stocks was
about 6 per cent belyo its mid-May high and 4.5 per cent above the lowest
point reached in the June decline. Trading activity on the New York
Stock Exchange was light to moderate during July with an average of
4 million shares traded per day.

III -7
Total stock market credit as reported by the New York Exchange
and weekly reporting member banks showed no change in June, remaining at
$7.1 billion despite the sharp break in market prices. Data provided
by the Stock Exchange Margin Panel, however, indicate a significant de-
cline in debit balances in customers' margin accounts. This universe
total (blown up from accounts of 245,000 customers at firms whose book-
keeping is processed by electronic equipment) is estimated at $4.6 bil-
lion for the end of June -- down $130 million during the month. Margin
panel estimates of credit in margin accounts differ from total customer
net debit balances reported by stock exchange firms -- which remained con-
stant at $5.1 billion in June -- by excluding debt in subscription ac-
counts and credit extended in connection with cash transactions to be
settled within the usual three-day period. Transactions volume was heavy
toward the end of June, which suggests that a temporary bulge in this
latter type of credit was a major factor preventing a decline in reported
stock market credit totals in that month.
Margin panel data also indicate the extent to which price de-
clines in June increased the vulnerability of customer credit to margin
calls. The table below shous the status of net debit balances in margin
accounts distributed according to the customer's equity in his collateral.

After margins were raised to 70 per cent in November 1963,
margin account debt was upgraded very sharply in the year and a half
of continued price increases which folloned. More recently, declining
stock prices have produced some deterioration in margin status as can
be seen by comparing the June and April distributions. With average
prices falling 5.6 per cent between the end of April and the end of June,
the share of debt most likely to become vulnerable to call -- that mar-
gined at less than 50 per cent -- rose moderately from 18 to 25 per cent.
But for most stock market credit, customers' equities continue to pro-
vide substantially more buffer against maintenance margins (which range
from 25-33 per cent at most firms) than in late 1963, when 43 per cent
of net debt was margined below 50 per cent.
Mortgage markets. In June, the FHA-secondary market yield
series, at 5.44 per cent, was little different from the average for the
period since April 1963. Contract interest rates for conventional first
mortgages on homes, as reported by the Federal Housing Administration,
also remained about unchanged in June, at 5.80 per cent for new home loans
and 5.85 per cent for loans on existing houses.
Loan-to-price ratios and maturities on conventional first mort-
gages for new homes in June were generally somewhat less liberal than
in either the previous month or in June of 1964. Also, average loan
amounts were only slightly higher than a year earlier. In the case
of existing home loans, however, some further year-to-year liberaliza-
tion was still continuing, as shown in the table.

Mortgage debt expansion in the second quarter of the year ap-
parently moderated appreciably from the record rate reached a year earlier
and, while still quite large, was below any second quarter since 1962.
As in the first quarter of this year, the moderation reflected mainly a
reduced rate of expansion in the holdingsof savings and loan associa-
tions. But, unlike developments since early 1964, indications are that
none of the other major financial institutions did more than match their
year-earlier pace.

A factor in the reduced rate of mortgage debt expansion has been the
louer level of residential -- especially multifamily -- starts this year.
Also, net savings inflows to major lending institutions have tended to
fall below year-earlier levels in recent months, and pressure on lenders
to follow more selective loan-originating policies has increased.
On a seasonally adjusted basis, expansion in mortgage debt
approximated an annual rate of $28 billion in the second quarter of the
year, compared uith a record $31.5 billion reached in the second quarter
of last year. Then expansion in home debt had already begun to moderate
somewhat, but the rate of net additions to debt on multifamily and com-
mercial properties was still rising. Since then, both types of debt
have grown less rapidly.
U. S. Government securities market. The Treasury announced
the terms of its August refinancing on July 22 and early market reaction
pointed to a successful operation. The Treasury is offering two issues
in exchange for $7.3 billion of maturing notes, of which $3.2 billion are
held by the public. The exchange options include a new 18-month note
priced to yield 4.10 per cent and the reopened 4's of February 1969
priced to yield 4.17 per cent. While attrition in the refunding is ex-
pected to be minimal in view of the attractive pricing of the new issues,
the participation of the dealers in the refunding was restrained by their
sizable holdings of intermediate-term bonds and the absence of significant
investor demand for such bonds in recent weeks.
Yields on outstanding Treasury notes and bonds edged up in late
July, as developments in Vietnam served to introduce a note of caution in

III -11
the market. The reopening of a 3-1/2 year bond in the August refund-
ing also contributed to some upward yield adjustments in the intermediate-
term area. In addition, investors were small net sellers of over-five-
year bonds during the second half of July, as some institutional inves-
tors sold Governments to take advantage of recent increases in corporate
bond yields. Given their sizable holdings of longer-term bonds, dealers
tended to resist adding to their positions in these issues by marking
down their prices and expanding their offerings. In recent days the
market has steadied following sizable Treasury investment account pur-
chases of August refunding rights and intermediate-term issues.

Treasury bill rates declined in mid-July but turned up in late
July and early August. The decline reflected sizable investment
demand for bills from a variety of investors and an improving avail-
ability of funds to finance dealer positions. More recently, invest-
ment demand for bills has tapered off and dealers have been particu-
larly disappointed over the modest demand

III -12
from sellers of "rights" to the August refunding. As a result, some
dealers have expanded their offerings of bills at rising yields in an
effort to reduce sizable holdings built up in anticipation of demand
related to the August refunding. Some reduction in these holdings oc-
curred in the first reek of August, following System purchases of nearly
$275 million of bills in the market and the cautious dealer bidding in
the August 2 weekly auction which resulted in the lightest dealer awards
of the year.
Treasury finance. The cash deficit for fiscal 1965 was $2.7
billion. As can be seen from Table 1, Federal revenues totaled $119.7
billion in fiscal 1965, an increase of $4.2 billion over 1964. In spite
of the reduction in tax rates, corporate profits tax collections were
nearly $2.0 billion higher -- and even individual income tax collections
after refunds were $100 million higher -- than in fiscal 1964. Cash
expenditures totaled $122.4 billion, somewhat higher than anticipated
earlier due to increased spending in June. The overall increase in ex-
penditures from fiscal 1964 to fiscal 1965 amounted to $2.0 billion.
Although there were sizable increases in expenditures in several areas,
these were largely offset by a $3.7 billion decline in defense expendi-
tures. Defense expenditures were $2.0 billion below even the level esti-
mated last January.
Defense expenditures for fiscal 1966 are currently estimated at
$53.3 billion, only $800 million above the amount estimated in the January
Budget Document, an amount added to the defense budget to cover the mili-
tary pay increase expected to go into effect October 1. The cost-cutting
programs instituted by the Defense Department over the past two years
were more successful than anticipated even last January and largely account

III -13
for the reduction in fiscal 1965 defense expenditures below the Document.
The success of these programs was expected to continue to hold Defense
expenditures (in fiscal 1966) about $2 billion below the amount estimated
in the Document. However, as a result of Vietnam, the situation is changing.
An increase in authorizations of $1.7 billion was requested August 4
and further additions may be requested later. Implicit in the $53.3
billion figure shown in the table for fiscal 1966 is an increase of $2
billion in actual expenditures arising out of developments in Vietnam.
Increased civilian pay is expected to take effect at the same
time as the increases in military pay and expenditures for housing and
agricultural programs now are expected to be higher than projected in
the Document. In total, Federal cash expenditures for fiscal 1966 are
projected to be $130.1 billion. Federal revenues are now projected at
$125.2 for fiscal 1966, which produces an estimated cash deficit of nearly
$5 billion.
Social Security bill. The 1965 Social Security Amendments were
signed into law July 30. The bill provides hospital insurance and
voluntary medical insurance for all persons over 65, increases Social
Security benefits by 7 per cent, liberalizes the eligibility requirements
for recipients of Social Security benefits and expands public assistance
programs, especially in provision of medical services.
The program is now expected to cost $6.5 billion a year when
fully effective. However, the increase in expenditures has been phased
out throughout the year with the expenditures for medical care not scheduled
to begin until fiscal 1967. As a result, the cost of the total program

in fiscal 1966 is expected to be $3 billion, of which $800 million
represents a lump-sum payment to Social Security beneficiaries to cover
the retroactive (to January 1, 1965) increase in these benefits. host
of this lump-sum payment is expected to occur in September.
Increased payroll taxes have also been legislated to cover the
cost of the program. As finally passed, the ceiling on wages and salaries
has been raised from the first $4,830 to the first $6,600 of income and
the combined tax rate from 7-1/2 to 8.4 per cent (one-half of the tax
is paid by the employees; one-half by the employer). The tax on self-
employed persons is 3/4 of the combined rate. The increased taxes are
to be effective as of the first of the year and will irrrease tax lia-
bilities about $6.0 billion in calendar 1966. In addition, the
voluntary medical insurance is expected to yield $300 million ($600
million at annual rates) but it is not clear whether this will be handled
as a receipt or treated as a negative expenditure since the $2 a month
voluntary contribution can be deducted from social security benefit checks;
nor is it clear when such contributions are to start. Not all of the
increase in tax liability will be realized as cash receipts in calendar
1966 due to the lags in collection.
An additional increase in the tax rate from 8.4 to 8.8 per cent
is scheduled for January 1, 1967. Further increases in the combined
tax rate are scheduled for 1969 and at somewhat irregular intervals
thereafter until 1987 when a rate of 11.3 per cent has been reached. In
its final form, no future increases in the ceiling on the wages subject
to tax were legislated.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
U.S. balance of payments. The surplus in U.S. international
transactions appears to have continued in recent weeks. Partial data for
July, a seasonally unfavorable month, suggest an unadjusted deficit on
regular transactions smaller than would be expected on seasonal grounds.
Changes in reserve assets and in liquid liabilities to foreigners during
July reflected the special advance repayment of $179 million by France on
its postwar debt to the U.S.
Revised data now show an over-all payments surplus for June of
$65 million in place of the approximate balance indicated earlier. For
the second quarter, after allowance for net special receipts of perhaps
$75 million and for seasonal variation, the surplus on regular transactions
may now be estimated at about $250 million, seasonally adjusted. On the
official settlements basis, the surplus was much smaller. (Preliminary
official estimates of the second quarter balance of payments will be
released in mid-August.)
Merchandise imports in June remained at the high annual rate
of $22 billion, while exports at an annual rate of $26 billion were down
further from the March peak. By June any continued after-effects of the
dock strike were probably small. As shown in the table below, exports
in June were no higher than last autumn's level, and the average rate
of exports from last December through June was about 2 per cent lower.
Imports, on the other hand, were up sharply on both comparisons. Steel
imports rose further in June, and the increase in these imports from last

IV -2
autumn was close to $1 billion at an annual rate. The rise in other
imports over this period was also very sharp, by more than 10 per cent
in the aggregate, an increase more noteworthy since the value of food
imports declined.

Outstanding bank claims on foreigners covered by the VFCR
decreased during the second quarter by $300 million. Included in this
net decline are about $200 million of term loans sold by some banks, mainly
to their foreign branches. Declines in outstanding short-term loans and
acceptance credits account for much of the remaining net change in claims
covered by the VFCR.
In U.S. balance of payments accounts, the net reflow, as reported
by all U.S. banks, was about $370 million. This figure is based on re-
ports from a wider group of institutions than those reporting under the
VFCR and covers a slightly different grouping of assets. Of this total
reflow, $70 million are likely to have reflected transactions by customers
of banks.
Outstanding long-term bank loans declined throughout the quarter.
Apart from the $200 million sell-offs, there was a seasonally adjusted
net inflow of about $25 million, compared with a $70 million net outflow
in the second quarter a year ago. The sell-offs accounted for the bulk

IV -3
of the declines in long-term claims on Europe ($120 million) and Latin
America ($80 million); there was a small rise in claims on Japan. Most,
if not all, of the sell-offs absorbed Euro-dollars that would otherwise
have been available in European credit markets; thus, these markets have
been effectively refinancing the credits originally extended by U.S. banks.
New long-term loan commitments during the quarter to developed
countries were principally to borrowers in Japan and Australia and totalled
$200 million. Commitments to LDC's,principally Latin America and the
Philippines, totaled $140 million. For the quarter as a whole new commit-
ments were made at a monthly rate of probably $100 million per month,
about half the monthly average for the year 1964.
Outstanding short-term loans and acceptance credits increased
$30 million in June, following declines in April and May. For the quarter
as a whole there was a seasonally adjusted net reflow of short-term bank
credits of about $20 million. This reflow was composed of outflows to
Latin America ($20 million) and Japan ($50 million) and a reflow from
the rest of the world totaling about $90 million, a sizeable part of
which reflected a special transaction with Canada.
Liquid funds abroad reported by banks declined in June by
$80 million, to some extent reflecting seasonal influences. For the
quarter as a whole, banks reported a net reflow of $140 million. Non-
banks reported a reflow of $120 million for April and May apart from a
$90 million increase in foreign currency deposits, which is known to
have represented funds in transit.

IV -4
Trade of other industrial countries. The Common Market
countries had a balanced trade position in the first five months of
1965, in contrast to their combined trade deficit in the corresponding
months of 1964, which had been at an annual rate of over $500 million
(imports valued c.i.f., exports f.o.b.). The change reflected a sharp
drop in Italian imports (which ended in the summer of 1964), a consider-
able increase in French exports, and increases in Dutch and Belgian
exports that exceeded the moderate import increases of these two
countries. On the other hand, partly offsetting these factors making
for a smaller aggregate deficit, Germany's imports rose nearly 25 per
cent while its exports increased by 10 per cent.
Since the beginning of 1965, German imports hEve continued to
rise (through June). The growth of German imports has been one of the
principal expansive forces in world trade during this recent period,
along with rising import demand in the United States and Canada. British
imports were also substantially higher in the second quarter than in the
first. While the rise in British imports included manufactures and
materials, it also represented in part a rebound from an unusually low
level of British food imports in the first quarter, probably due in part
to the U.S. dock strike. Elsewhere in Europe recent import advances have
been moderate -- even in Italy, where domestic recovery has been proceed-
ing rapidly -- or nil, as in France. Outside Europe, the quarter-to-
quarter rise in Japanese imports shown in the last two columns of the
table largely reflected irregular monthly fluctuations rather than a
real upswing. However, a sharp rise that occurred in June may mark the
beginning of an upturn in Japanese imports.

The rise in imports of the European members of OECD since a
year ago has been most marked for intra-European trade, as may be seen in
the lower part of the table. Intra-EEC trade was further stimulated at
the beginning of 1965 when a new 10 per cent tariff reduction became
effective within EEC. Tariffs have now been reduced to 30 per cent of
their original level. A similar reduction within EFTA also went into
effect on January 1. In recent months, imports from nonindustrial
countries both by the U.K. and by continental countries have been
relatively flat, as the further expansion in import demand has been
mainly for manufactured products rather than raw materials.__
_ ___~ __ __ ___

IV -6
Imports by nonindustrial countries (not shown in the table)
appear to have been still rising, in the aggregate, last spring, but
sharp losses of reserves were being experienced by some -- in particular,
by Australia and South Africa -- making it unlikely that the rise would
continue.
In May and June a downturn in U.K. shipments to sterling area
countries was a major factor in the sluggish performance of British
export trade. With British imports up, especially in May when the cut
in import surcharge on most non-food imports from 15 to 10 per cent took
effect, the trade balance worsened again. In view of the continued
precariousness of Britain's external position, the authorities on July 27
took further measures: (1) to limit central government and local authority
financing; (2) to require permits for certain types of private construction
and to restrain instalment buying; (3) to make export financing easier
and import financing tighter; and (4) to tighten exchange controls by
(a) not allowing prepayment of imports before shipment of the goods and
(b) various measures affecting the financing of British direct investment
subsidiaries abroad and of foreign direct investment subsidiaries in the
United Kingdom.
Countries whose exports have been responding most vigorously in
recent months to rising demand in world trade include France, Italy, the
Netherlands, Switzerland, Japan, and Canada. The rise in French and Dutch
exports, in particular, has owed a good deal to growing demand from
Germany. Germany's own exports, after rising by 10 per cent from the
first quarter of 1964 to the first quarter of 1965, appear to have
flattened out in the second quarter.

Euro-dollar rates. Quoted deposit rates in the London Euro-dollar
market eased off further during July, following a decline in June for all
but the shortest maturities. Rates for longer-term deposits held up quite
firmly in July, and the 180-day rate averaged about 5/8 per cent higher
than a year ago. Rates for shorter maturities fell sharply in the third
week of July, when funds were moving out of sterling into dollars. The
call rate was quoted at 4-1/16 per cent at the end of the month, only
3/16 per cent higher than a year earlier. The decline in Euro-dollar

IV -9
rates during June and July was accompanied by an increase in liabilities
of U.S. banks to their branches abroad. This suggests that some U.S.
banks may have been using Euro-dollar money obtained by their branches
not only to finance transfers of loan assets to the branches as already
mentioned, but also to supplement their U.S. money market financing.

APPENDIX A; PROJECTION OF U.S. BALANCE OF PAYMENTS IN 1965
A revised projection of the U.S. balance of payments in 1965
recently made by the National Foreign Trade Council Balance of Payments Group
was released on July 23, and is shown in the table below together with actual
date for 1964. Explanatory footnotes have been added to define the content
of some of the items shown.

The projected deficit on regular transactions for 1965 of some-
what over $1 billion would represent an improvement of $2 billion over
the actual outturn in 1964. The major changes projected between the two
years are a $3 billion cut in private capital outflows partly offset by a
$1 billion deterioration in the trade surplus. Estimates of both capital
outflows and the trade surplus were lowered from those made by the NFTC
Group last January.
The projected reduction of U.S. private capital outflows as compared
with 1964 was thought of as follows: little or no reduction in the direct
investment outflow from last year's $2.4 billion, though in the absence of
the President's program the outflow might have grown further this year; per-
haps a $1/2 billion reduction in other long-term outflows, mainly in bank
loans; a reduction of $1 billion or more in short-term bank credit outflows;
and a shift in the movement of non-bank liquid funds from an outflow of over
$1/2 billion to an inflow of over $1/2 billion. Without this inflow of
liquid funds, the deficit would be in the $1-1/2 to $2 billion range.
Imports were estimated at nearly 10 per cent above last year's
average, as the high rate of imports in the first half of the year resulted
in an upward revision of last January's estimate. Merchandise exports were
projected at $26 billion, about 3 per cent above the 1964 total. Last
January's export estimate was scaled down somewhat in the light of the rate
of export shipments recorded thus far this year. A sizeable minority of
the Group thought that the $26 billion estimate may still be somewhat too
high.
