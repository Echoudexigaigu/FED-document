CURRENT ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL CONDITIONS

IN BROAD REVIEW
Two of the three major uncertainties that dominated economic
prospects a month ago have been clarified. A steel labor agreement
has been reached without a strike and on a noninflationary basis.
Recent strength of sterling on foreign exchange markets has greatly re-
duced the threat of international financial disorder from that source.
The steel settlement, for psychological as well as more
tangible economic reasons, has removed one of the potential obstacles
to continued price stability. At the same time, however, it has brought
the possibility of some industrial contraction as excessive steel (and
maybe other)inventories are being brought down to sustainable levels.
Steel output this month is being cut 15 per cent or more and this will act
as a down-drag en the total industrial production index of about 1 point.
A similar down-drag is likely in October.
The third uncertainty is still present. The war in Vietnam has
been stepped up and other hostilities have occurred in the Far East. For
the short run, increased intensity of U.S. defense efforts has modified
some of the earlier concern about whether overall economic expansion could
continue uninterrupted in the face of the steel adjustment. Expert opinion,
earlier divided about prospects beyond the fall months, has now shifted and
there is near-unanimity that overall expansion will continue for some time
although not necessarily at as rapid a rate as in recent quarters.
The shift in sentiment has been influenced by current economic
and market developments. The confirmation given by successive surveys
of business plans for continued increases in fixed capital outlays is

1-2
a strategic factor in the outlook. A July survey of consumer attitudes
and plans, moreover, provides statistical evidence of high consumer
optimism and increased plans to purchase autos and homes.
Meanwhile, Government expenditures are continuing to rise not
only for defense purposes, including higher military pay rates, but also
for nondefense purposes. A large and retroactive increase in social
security benefits means an extraordinarily sharp rise in personal income
in September.
Thus, for all major categories of final demand -- business,
consumer, and government -- the prospect is for further expansion.
Inventory demand, however, is expected to decline.
Actual data through August or early September are somewhat
mixed but generally provide support to indications of improved sentiment.
Thus, the labor market strengthened further in August and unemployment
remained at the reduced level reached in July. Construction activity
rose slightly, although housing starts in August were down. New orders
for durable goods also declined in August but orders to the key machinery
industry remained high. Auto and other retail sales were maintained at
high rates in August and early September. Industrial commodity prices
have shown little further rise since mid-year.
Additional firmness has developed in financial markets in August
and September as a result of cumulating pressure on bank reserve positions,
a further decline in corporate liquidity, heavy demands for funds from banks
and the capital markets, and more buoyant expectations about future economic
activity. Reflecting in part the cumulating pressure on reserve positions,
the rate of bank credit expansion, although still large, has been declining.

1 -3
Both long-term corporate and Treasury yields have reached the
highest level since 1960, while yields on State and local government bonds
have risen to their highest level since early 1962, Most recently, corporate
bond yields, which earlier had shown the sharpest rise, have tended to
level out, reflecting in part a smaller prospective calendar of new issues.
Short-term yields have also risen, but more modestly. Three-
month Treasury bill yields are only a few basis points below their
February peak, while those on 6-month bills have regained their earlier
high. Money market conditions hcve been tauter, despite somewhat lower
net borrowed reserves in recent weeks.
The stock market has also reflected the more optimistic business
expectations and by late September had recovered almost all of its spring
losses. Treasury fall financing needs are quite large but will be
concentrated in the tax bill area.
The U.S. international payments position in July and August,
roughly adjusted for seasonality, was not very different from the average
for the first half of 1965, a deficit at an annual rate of $1-1/4 billion.
Since the beginning of September a marked change for the better
has occurred in exchange market attitudes toward sterling. Earlier, in
August the two-year decline in U.K. Government bond prices has come to a
halt.

THE DOMESTIC ECONOMY
Industrial production. The slight rise in the total index
in August to 144.4 from 144.2 in July was due primarily to a further
sharp increase in business equipment; output of consumer goods changed
little while a 4 per cent decline in output of iron and steel lowered
the index for total materials to 146.6 from 146.9 in July.
Although consumption of steel mill products by manufacturers
is at record rates, inventories of these goods held by manufacturers at
the end of July were about a third above the peaks of 1962 and 1963
and apparently rose further in August. In early September steel ingot
production dropped, and output of steel mill products is also expected
to drop sharply while inventories are being reduced, even though total
stocks are not expected to reach the 1962 and 1963-64 lows. Decreases
in output of iron and steel of 15 per cent or so in September and, also,
in October would amount to a 1.0 point decline in the total production
index in each month. The probable curtailment in steel raises the question
of whether there is enough upward push in final products and materials
other than steel to offset these declines?

Output of consumer goods has changed little since January after
rising sharply in the last half of 1964. Auto assemblies have been at
record rates so far this year and production schedules for September
and the fourth quarter indicate little change from current high levels.
Output of home goods and apparel has changed little at advanced levels.
Retail sales of these goods, after declining somewhat from earlier highs,
increased in June and July, and, according to preliminary figures, de-
clined in August. Stocks, however, were at new highs by the end of July.
Further incentives for increases in output for the cyclical consumer
goods -- autos, home goods, and apparel -- could come if consumer
demands strengthen as a result of the sharp rise in personal income in
September.
Output of business equipment is continuing strong. However,
a two point rise in this group only amounts directly to about .3 of one
point in the total index. Output of defense equipment has increased 10
per cent since January and this accounted directly for .3 of a point in
the total index.
Output of materials other than iron and steel has risen
rapidly since January and was undoubtedly influenced by the prolonged
demands for materials by the steel industry and by demands for inventory
accumulation of semifinished metal products as well as by rising final
use. Since late 1964 the index of materials output has been considerably
above that for final products. This is in contrast to the 1962 and 1963
experience when the index of materials output was generally lower than
that for final products.

II -3
Considering the magnitude of the expected decline in iron and
steel and likely production developments in other areas as outlined
above, the total production index is likely to decline one point or so in
September and again in October.
Retail sales. Retail sales declined 1 per cent in August,
but with July at a very advanced level August and July together averaged
2 per cent higher than the second quarter. In early September, with
auto sales particularly strong, retail sales appear to have increased
somewhat.
Sales of autos and other durable goods in August held at the
advanced July levels and the July-August average for durable goods was
nearly 4 per cent above the second quarter. Automotive dealer sales
were up 5 per cent.
Sales of nondurable goods were down in August -- particularly
for apparel -- but for the two summer months sales were up 1 per cent
from spring levels. This fairly typical rise followed an unusually large
(2.2 per cent) increase from the first to the second quarter.
Unit automobile sales and stocks. Sales of new domestic auto-
mobiles continued at advanced levels in August and early September; the
seasonally adjusted annual rate in August was 8.9 million vehicles, equal
to June and July rates and 7 per cent above a year earlier. Dealer
deliveries in the first 10 days of September were 14 per cent above a
year ago.

II -4
New car inventories continued well above a year ago in August
and early September. Differences in the relationships between sales and
stocks in the two years are difficult to interpret, however, because of
the different changeover pattern this year. Last year the lowest pro-
duction came in the first week of August, while this year it was in the
last v'eek of the month. New car introduction dates this year are one
or two weeks later than last year.
Consumer credit. Credit buying tapered off a little in August,
judging by early reports from commercial banks. Auto credit demands
apparently were not ouite so vigorous as earlier, although this was at
least partly offset by increased use of credit to purchase furniture,
appliances, color television, and other household durables. Meanwhile,
repair and modernization loans and personal loans showed changes similar
to those reported for July. Despite the slowing in August, total instal-
ment credit through the first 8 months of 1965 increased at anannual rate
of close to $8 billion, compared with less than $6 billion for the same
period in 1964.
Education loans have been in especially heavy demand this summer
and fall, according to comments from a number of lenders. This has
reflected not only a rise in tuition and related costs but also an in-
crease in the number of students attending college. During the year
ending June 1965, the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare granted
loans of $130 million under its Federal Aid to Education program. In
anticipation of increased demand, HEW has asked that $180 million be set
aside for this purpose for the fiscal year ending June 1966.

II -5
Auto terms continue relatively easy at both sales finance
companies and commercial banks. In the case of new car contracts, the
easing has taken the form of a gradual rise in the proportion of contracts
written for 36 months. A similar lengthening trend has been taking
place for used cars. At present a larger proportion of all used car
contracts is written on a 36-month basis than on a 24-month basis -- just
the reverse of tvo years ago. In part, this shift reflects the younger
average age of the used cars being sold.
Consumer buvinR plans. Consumers are optimistic about their
future income prospects and are planning increased purchases of major
items, according to the Census quarterly survey conducted in mid-July.
The proportion of households reporting expectations of higher income a year
hence was appreciably above a year earlier and also above any other period
from 1959 to date. Plans to buy new autos over the coming 12 months were
higher than a year earlier -- 9.6 per cent of all households indicated
such plans with 9.0 per cent in July 1964. Definite plans to buy new cars
within 6 months also were up appreciably from a year earlier. Buying
intentions for used cars and for major household durable goods were about
as strong as they were a year earlier.
Among the factors accounting for the large rise in new car
sales in recent years has been expansion of multiple car ownership. The
July survey revealed that the proportion of households owning two or more
autos, which has been increasing in recent years, showed a large further

II -6
rise from mid-1964 to mid-1965 -- from 21.9 per cent to 23.6 per cent.
As recently as 1960, this proportion was 17.9 per cent.
Personal income. Personal income rose a little more than $1
billion in August to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $532 billion,
a level 6.4 per cent above a year earlier. The August rise was limited
by a large further decline in agricultural income following a sharp
runup -- more than $4 billion, annual rate -- in the second ouarter mainly
because of higher prices for livestock and for fresh fruits and vegetables.
Excluding agricultural income, the August increase in personal income was
only slightly less than in each of the three preceding months.
Personal income in September will rise sharply since it will
include the recently enacted current and retroactive increases in social
security benefits and higher military pay rates. The larger social
security benefits include: (a) a 7 per cent permanent increase in old age
and survivors' insurance benefits (around $1.2 billion annual rate);
(b) a $885 million retroactive payment to cover the first eight months of
the year ($10.6 billion annual rate); and (c) small increases in some
miscellaneous welfare benefits. In addition, military pay rates
were increased effective September 1 and these add $1.1 billion
annual rate to military payrolls.
In summary, September personal income will include a continuing
increase amounting to about $2.5 billion, annual rate, and a one-time payment
amounting to over $10 billion, annual rate. If all other payments were

II -7
to continue at their August levels, these additional payments would
riase personal income in the third quarter to around $536 billion from
$525 billion in the second quarter. There is no reason to think that the
bulk of these large additions to personal income will not, with some lag,
be reflected in higher consumption expenditures.
Labor market. The labor market showed further improvement in
August as the up'ard trend in nonfarm employment was maintained. All of
the August increase in employment was in the nonmanufacturing sector.
Factory employment leveled off following a steady rise beginning late
last year.
In manufacturing, employment declined in primary metals and
metal fabricating industries as steel inventory accumulation tapered off.
Inability of standard seasonal factors adequately to adjust for the shift
in timing of the automobile model changeover also affected reported employ-
ment. In machinery, rubber, ordnance, and aircraft industries employment
continued to advance.
In nonmanufacturing, employment advanced in transportation and
public utilities, service, and State and local government activities.
Construction employment, which had dipped moderately in July because of
strikes, recovered nearly all of that loss in August.
The unemployment rate, at 4.5 per cent in August, was unchanged
from July but well below the 5.1 per cent of a year earlier. There were,
however, shifts in the composition of unemployment, with rates for women
and married men moderately higher than in July and rates for blue collar,

II -8
nonihite, and young workers lower. The teenage unemployment rate, at
12.4 per cent in August fell to a three-year low, but the decline was
accompanied by reductions in the teenage labor force and employment.
Both of these reductions may have been a reaction to unusually large
increases reported in July. The total civilian labor force also declined
in August although it was still 1.7 million above a year earlier, and well
above the average year-to-year growth of 1.2 million experienced in the
first half of 1965. About one-half of this 1.7 million labor force
growth over the year was accounted for by the teenage group.
Hours and earnings. The work week in manufacturing at 40.9 hours
in August was little changed from that in recent months, but was slightly
below the high reached in the first quarter. Overtime hours then had been
unusually high because of the strike-hedge demande for steel, and the
catchup in automobile output after last fall's strike. In recent months
producers have tended to meet higher production schedules by increasing
employment and by curtailing overtime hours paid for at premium rates.
Hourly compensation in manufacturing has continued to increase
at about the same rate as earlier. In August, hourly earnings of factory
production workers rose slightly to $2.63 an hour, seasonally adjusted,
a rise of 3.1 per cent from the year earlier. This was about the same
rate of increase as in other recent years. Unit labor costs showed a
moderate rise in August, as the rise in manufacturing output tapered
off because of reduced steel production. Short-term reductions in output
are not usually reflected immediately in corresponding declines in manhours
of work and consequently, unit labor costs may tend to rise when growth in
production slows.

II -9
Prices. The industrial commodity price index, unchanged in
July, edged up .1 per cent in August. Weekly estimates indicate little
or no change into mid-September. Thus, the industrial index has increased
little more than .2 per cent in the four months since May, after rising
more than 1 per cent from last autumn to May. Average prices of foodstuffs
have declined slightly from their July peak, and the total wholesale
price index has been stable during the past eight weeks.
Increases in prices of metals and machinery have been responsible
for most of the rise in the industrial index, but an index for all
industrial commodities excluding metals and machinery, which had shown
little net change last year, has edged up slightly this year. The rise
has reflected a sharp rise in hides and generally small increases in
lumber, petroleum products, tires, and some textiles and paper products.
Declines occurred in some consumer products such as appliances, radio
and television sets.
The price of copper scrap has risen further as world demand for
copper has continued to increase while supplies, although increasing,
have frequently been disrupted. Aluminum producers are reported to be
shifting from long-term price contracts to a policy of pricing at time
of shipment; this change suggests expectations of a further rise in the
ingot price. A release of 150,000 tons of zinc from the Federal stock-
pile during the next six months is expected to supplement current monthly
production of 90,000 tons and to permit all domestic demands to be met.
Recently, a major auto producer announced somewhat higher list
prices for most of its 1966 model cars. A large part of the rise can be

accounted for by incorporation of a number of safety features which
previously were optional. Whether the remaining fraction of the increase
can be attributed to other improvements or to a true price rise is as
yet unclear.
Average prices of foodstuffs have drifted downward since July
mainly because of greater than seasonal declines in fresh fruits and
vegetables, and also because of price declines in meats and poultry
resulting from increased supplies. Counteracting these reductions have
been seasonal price increases in dairy products and eggs.
New orders for durable goods. New orders for durable goods,
which had risen for two months, declined 4 per cent in August according
to advance figures. About half the August decline was due to a sharp
drop in steel orders. But new orders for most other types of products
also declined moderately. Orders about equaled sales, which were off
moderately from the record July level, and total unfilled orders were
unchanged, with steel backlogs down sharply and backlogs for other durable
goods up further.
Orders have been fluctuating around a relatively stable trend
so far this year, but over the course of the year steel orders have been
declining (from February to August the decline amounted to 37 per cent)
while orders for other durable goods have advanced. In recent months
new orders for defense products have been below the exceptionally high
April level but above the beginning of the year. Orders for machinery
and equipment have been increasing irregularly and in July and August
averaged 10 per cent higher than in January and February.

II -11
Business inventories. Accumulation of business inventories
(book value) which had slackened moderately in the second quarter, rose
in July to equal the high first quarter rate, reflecting a step-up at
manufacturers. The sharp July rise in factory stocks was probably
temporary. It was concentrated in goods-in-process in the durable
goods sector and was associated with the large spurt in output. Steel
production declined in August and has declined substantially further in
September. At distributors, the rate of increase in stocks slowed fur-
ther in July. The slackening was pronounced at both durable (mainly
autos) and nondurable goods retailers and at nondurable goods whole-
salers.
On a GNP basis (which includes a valuation adjustment for
price increases), nonfarm business inventory accumulation was at an
annual rate of $9.3 billion in the first quarter and $7.1 billion in
the second quarter. In the third quarter a further decline of $1 bil-
lion or so in the rate of accumulation now appears likely, owing mainly
to lower accumulation at distributors. Another and probably larger
decline is in prospcct for the fourth quarter, with the decline coming
mainly from a shift from accumulation to liquidation of steel stocks.
Manufacturers' inventory and sales expectations. According to
the Commerce survey conducted in late July and August, manufacturers antici-
pate inventory accumulation of $803 million (book value) in the current
quarter, little changed from the actual rate of accumulation in the
preceding two quarters. For the fourth quarter, however, manufacturers
are projecting inventory accumulation at a substantially reduced

II -12
rate--$500 million--because of a run off in steel stocks held by durable
goods producers. In the first and second quarters, actual inventory
accumulation turned out close to the anticipations recorded in the
successive Commerce quarterly surveys.
Almost the entire book value increase at manufacturers in the
first half of the year was in durable goods and perhaps half of the durable
increase represented accumulation of steel stocks. Durable goods pro-
ducers (in late July and August) expected steel stockpiling to continue in
the third quarter and anticipated a book value increase of $600 million,
moderately less than earlier. In the fourth quarter, considerable liqui-
dation of excessive steel stocks is anticipated and total durable goods
accumulation is now projected at only $200 million.
Manufacturers as a whole expect further expansion of sales in
the current quarter and also in the fourth despite probable sharply re-
duced activity in the steel industry. A 4 per cent sales rise is now
projected from the second to the fourth quarter, with nondurable goods
showing somewhat more rise than durable goods. In comparison, manu-
facturers' sales increased 5-1/2 per cent between the fourth quarter 1964
and the second quarter 1965. Sales generally exceeded expectations in
that period.
Construction activity. Expenditures for new construction in
August remained near the record seasonally adjusted annual rate reached
in June. Business construction, already at a record high, moved higher
while public construction continued to fluctuate at an advanced level.

II -13
Private residential construction, which had shown some recovery in the
first half of the year, edged off as it had in July, but held within 4
per cent of the peak reached in March of last year.

The slackening in residential construction is associated with
declining housing starts since June. In August, starts were the lowest
since early 1963, although on a three-month moving average basis, --
which provides a better measure of the trend of activity -- starts in the
most recent period were at an annual rate of nearly 1.5 million units,
slightly above the first quarter of this year. Building permits as well
as starts dropped further in August with both single- and multi-family
permits declining.

One factor in the lower level of single-family housing activity
in recent months has been speculative builder caution about housing
inventories even though indications of final demand have remained fairly
favorable. In July, the downtrend in the number of unsold houses
continued to another new low for the series, which began in late 1962.
As in the first six months, actual home sales by speculative builders
about matched sales a year earlier. And the Census Survey of consumer
intentions in July found plans to buy new and existing homes within the
next six months at least as high as in July last year.
Plant and equipment expenditures. Business outlays for new plant
and equipment will continue to rise through the balance of the year, and
the increase in the second half will be as much as in the first half,
according to the August survey of business plans conducted by the Depart-
ment of Commerce and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Thus,
business fixed investment -- a sometimes volatile and determining factor
in cyclical developments -- is continuing to provide economic strength.
The fourth quarter level is now expected to be about 11 per cent above that
in late 1964, as compared to a 16 per cent rise over the preceding year.
The total for 1965 is now projected to be 13.4 per cent above 1964, as
compared with an increase of 14.5 per cent last year. Moreover, plans
for fixed capital outlays have steadily strengthened during the year;
the preceding (May) survey had indicated a 12.5 per cent rise and the
February survey a 12 per cent gain.

II -15
At a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $52.9 billion, fourth
quarter outlays will be $19.5 billion, or more than 50 per cent, above
the recession low reached 4-1/2 years earlier. Total business fixed
investment outlays at year-end are likely to represent a little more than
10 per cent of GNP, not quite up to the 10.6 per cent at the peak of the
1955-57 investment boom.
Continued high rates of capital spending by manufacturers, at
least through the first half of 1966, are suggested by a recent NICB
survey of capital appropriations by the nation's 1000 largest manufacturers.

Bank credit. Credit expansion at city banks since late August
appears to have moderated somewhat. In the two weeks prior to the mid-
September tax period, loans and investments at these banks declined in
contrast with the usual increase. Expansion during the tax week, while
substantial, was about the same as the average of the preceding two years.
Thus, after allowance for seasonal influences, the rate of credit growth
over the past three weeks may have fallen somewhat below the rate that
has prevailed in recent months.
As indicated by the following analysis, some of the factors
contributing to this slowdown are likely to prove temporary. Nevertheless,
a moderation of the rate of credit expansion over the remainder of the
year from that in recent months is a reasonable possibility, barring any
major shift in the strength of credit demand.
1. Decline in Treasury balances. In late August and the first half
of September, banks were under heavy pressure owing to an unusually large
run-off of Treasury Tax and Loan Account balances. Presumably associated
with these deposit losses, banks found it necessary to make further marked
reductions in their holdings of U. S. Government securities. Substantial
redressing of these balances is in prospect for late September and early
October as a result of crediting of income tax receipts and the proceeds
of a large projected cash financing. This may be accompanied at least tem-
porarily by some increase in bank holdings of government securities.
2. Slackened business loan demand. Business loan demand weakened
considerably in the weeks immediately prior to the tax period. This re-
flected, in part, the beginning of liquidation of inventory borrowing in
the metals group, following a protracted earlier buildup. It also resulted

III -2
from a slowdown in loan expansion in several other industry groups--in-
cluding public utilities, trade, and miscellaneous manufacturing and
mining--which had contributed importantly to the earlier sharp rise in
business lending. Uhile loan liquidation in the metals group is likely
to continue for some weeks, the marked slackening in other industry
groups may prove short-lived, as suggested by the substantial general-
ized borrowing during the tax period discussed below. In addition, the
normal seasonal upswings in loans to food processors and commodity dealers
have recently appeared after having been held in abeyance for some time
by continued liquidation of the dock-strike loan bulge.
3. Reduced acauisitions of municipals. City bank holdings of
municipal and other securities showed little change in late August and
early September, a period in which they usually rise appreciably. This
development probably reflects mainly a temporary lull in deliveries of
new securities as a result of the reduced volume of underwritings in
August. To some extent, it may also indicate some reduction in the
availability of funds for municipals following a period of several
months of unusually rapid acquisitions--during which bank holdings of
Governments had been sharply reduced through switches to municipals,
and monetary policy had become somewhat firmer.
While the above three special influences on recent credit ex-
pansion have been on the down side, an unusual pattern of finance com-
pany borrowing has provided strong temporary support to credit growth.
As a result of heavy late-season production and the late model change-
over dates in the automobile industry, finance company borrowing at
banks to finance dealer inventories was unusually heavy in late August

III -3
and early September. These borrowings have now peaked out and finance
companies probably will make larger than usual repayments of bank debt
over the next two months.
Business loan expansion at city banks during the tax and divi-
dend payment week ending September 15 was broadly based and somewhat
larger than the substantial rise in that period last year. Borrowing
by finance companies and the run-off of CD's also were larger than a
year ago. On the other hand, dealer loans at banks and bank acquisitions
of U. S. Government securities were smaller, suggesting that businesses
placed less reliance on sales of Governments to satisfy their tax period
needs this year.
These developments appear consistent with the adjustments that
businesses might have been expected to make in meeting increased tax
and dividend payments under conditions of somewhat reduced liquidity.
Money and time deposits. Growth in the money supply moderated
in August following substantial expansion in June and July. The $200
million rise for the month was at an annual rate of about 1-1/2 per cent.
Over the last four months, however, the annual rate of increase has been
about 3 per cent, slightly higher than over the first four months of
the year. Preliminary data indicate that there was a rapid rise in
the first half of September, presumably associated with a more than
seasonal decline in U.S. Government deposits during that period.
Seasonally adjusted turnover of demand deposits at banks out-
side New York City rose somewhat in August to 35.5 following a sharp
decline in July. The average for the two months was about the same as
that for the second quarter, but about 6 per cent above the July-
August average last year.

III -4
Growth in time and savings deposits at commercial banks accel-
erated further in August from the advanced July rate of expansion. The
$2.5 billion rise for the month--representing an annual rate of almost
22 per cent--exceeded the large inflows of January and February associ-
ated with time deposit rate increases. Preliminary data indicate that
the rate of growth may have dropped in early September.
Bank reserves. Net borrowed reserves declined over the first
three weeks of September, averaging about $125 million. This compares
with $165 million in August, a level little different from that of the
three previous months./ Average member bank borrowings declined some-
what over the three-week period although they were relatively high again
by the midmonth. In addition, excess reserves increased somewhat. The
effective rate on Federal funds dropped below 4-1/8 per cent on only 3
of the 14 trading days in the period. A few transactions took place as
low as 1 per cent and, more frequently, as high as 4-1/4 per cent.
U. S. Government securities market. Yields on Treasury notes
and bonds continued to edge higher in the fi;st half of September and
then stabilized around midmonth. The earlier market weakness was asso-
ciated with net investor selling, in part on switches into higher-
yielding corporate bonds, and continued dealer efforts to reduce their
positions in Treasury bonds. A somewhat steadier market atmosphere
developed in mid-September, when dealer offerings of notes and bonds
1/ Based on average of daily figures for all reserve weeks ending

III -5
contracted and some dealer and other professional demand appeared.
This represented a response to the announcement of further interna-
tional arrangements to support the pound sterling, the excellent re-
ception accorded a large corporate bond issue, and the development of
a better technical position in the market. Investor interest in U.S.
Goverument bonds has not reappeared, however, as an underlying uncer-
tainty about the effects of economic expansion on the prospective level
of bond yields remain.
On September 20, dealer holdings of Treasury bonds due in
over-5-years totaled $162 million, including $69 million due in over-20-
years; at the end of August, these totals had been $287 million and $123
million, respectively. The recent decline in dealer holdings was more
than accounted for by System and Treasury purchases.

Rates on Treasury bills rose several basis points in this
period, with upward rate pressure concentrated in longer maturities
where dealer inventories have been relatively large and where the
Treasury's cash financing in early October is expected to add to mar-
ket supplies. Since around the mid-September tax date, dealer holdings

III -6
have had to be financed at generally higher borrowing costs both in
and outside New York. The-e has also been some upward movement in
CD rates as money market banks sought to attract deposits to offset
some of their large CD maturities on the tax and dividend dates.
Treasury finance. The Treasury in late September is expected
to announce its first cash financing of the current fiscal year. The
market generally anticipates an offering of March tax bills to be
followed later in the fall by June tax bills, and perhaps, if market
conditions permit, by a cash offering in the short-term coupon area.
As the first column of the accompanying table shows, the Treasury's net
cash needs in the second half of 1965 could be on the high side, and
they will be more concentrated in the last three months of the year
than in other recent years when more of the second half cash need had
been raised in July-September.

With Treasury cash borrowings likely to be concentrated in
the bill area over the balance of this year, additions to the market
supply of bills in the fourth quarter may be about twice as large as
in the corresponding period of the two previous years. This year's
borrowing pattern, as it has developed, may then put somewhat more than
usual upward pressures on bill rates in the fall months. Critical in
this respect will be the extent of bill demand. Through July of this
year banks and corporations were considerably larger net sellers of
bills than last year. Thus, the question remains whether a continu-
ation of economic expansion at recent rates will be accompanied by any
further pressure on the bill market as a result of liquidity adjust-
ments by these groups.

Corporate and municipal bond markets. After rising persistently
for more than a month, yields on new corporate bonds finally found a level
last week which attracted active investor interest. Indeed, yields on
new and recently offered issues turned down several basis points. Even
in the municipal market, where yields on seasoned issues continued to
advance, underwriters reported some pick-up of investment interest.

Unexpectedly enthusiastic reception accorded last week's large
Southern Bell Telephone offering appears to have acted as a catalyst in
changing the tone in corporate bond markets. Despite a reoffering yield
of 4.68 per cent -- several basis points below what most underwriters
and market analysts were anticipating -- the issue sold out quickly. As
this favorable market response became clear, remaining unsold balances of
other recently offered bonds -- which previously had been moving rather
slowly despite their advanced yields -- were quickly cleaned up.

III -9
To some extent, recent strengthening of corporate bond markets
has reflected the same general modification of earlier interest rate
expectation evident in the U.S. Government boiid market. The Frospect
of at least a temporary let-up in the corporate calendar of public offerings
after the current week is apparently lending some further support to prices.
During August, yield advances in the municipal bond market had
lagged behind those in other markets as dealers bid actively for a
seasonally reduced supply of new issues. During September, however, the
volume of offerings has expanded again to the $900 million monthly average
level prevailing earlier in the year. At the same time bank investment
demand has reportedly slackened somewhat, and dealers have had to raise
yields on advertised inventories to reflect developments in other bond
markets. At 3.25 per cent, Moody's average yield on high quality
municipals is 10 basis points above a month ago and only about 10 basis
points below the level that prevailed in late 1961 just before the 1962
change in Regulation Q. As in the corporate bond market, however, the
volume of new issues seems likely to be somewhat smaller in the weeks
immediately ahead, and dealers are apparently anticipating at least a
brief period in which market supply pressures may diminish.

Corporate finance. Statistics that have recently become available
on second quarter working capital positions of corporations provide some
additional insight on the recent and prospective volume of corporate
external financing. Not only do they help to explain the heavy volume
of summer corporate borrowing, they also suggest that general corporate
needs for financing over the remaining months of the year are likely to
remain large.
Despite generation of a record volume of internal funds, the first
half of 1965 was marked by exceptionally heavy corporate external financing,
at banks as well as in the capital markets. This combination of large
internal and external financing suggested the possibility that a part
of the heavy borrowing might have been undertaken in anticipation of future
needs. While some of this may have occurred during the summer, data now
available on corporate liquid asset holdings at midyear show that the total
of internal funds and external financing actually fell short of meeting
total corporate needs for funds. Corporate liquid assets were drawn down
by more than $4 billion in the first half of the year, compared with
a reduction of about $2.5 billion in the first half of each of the three
preceding years.
While coriorate liquidity, as measured by the ratio of cash,
deposits and U.S. Government security holdings to total current liabili-
ties, has been declining for many years, this decline has been especially
rapid since last fall. At the end of the second quarter this year, the
ratio stood at only 27.5 per cent which compares with 28.6 per cent three
months earlier and 31.4 per cent at mid-1964. If the definition of liquid

III -11
assets is broadened to include "other current assets" -- the item which
includes holdings of short-term marketable securities other than U.S.
Governments -- the downtrend in liquidity is less drastic but still remains.
As may be seen from the table, corporate investment in accounts
receivable and inventories was unusually large in the second quarter, and
undoubtedly absorbed funds that might otherwise have been held in liquid
forms, moderating the fall in liquidity. In the period immediately ahead,
aggregate inventory accumulation is likely to moderate, reflecting
adjustments in holdings of steel and steel-using items. But given the
anticipation of further substantial increases in plant and equipment
outlays over the remainder of the year, and assuming that internal funds
will remain at about recent levels, corporate demands for external funds
could still continue quite large.

Mortgage markets. Trade expectations generally are for no
significant upward shift in mortgage interest rates over the near term
and, on balance, recent statistical indicators appear to support this
view.
Secondary market yields on FHA-insured mortgages, at 5.45 per cent
remained within the narrow range which has prevailed since early 1963.
Contract rates for conventional first mortgages on existing homes rose
from 5.85 per cent to 5.90 per cent in August (rounded to the nearest
five basis points). Rates for loans on new homes, however, held
at the earlier level of 5.80 per cent.
Normally, any general shift in contract rates would be preceded
by a tightening in nonrate mortgage terms. But in July (the latest
available) loan-to-price ratios and maturities on conventional first
mortgage loans for both new and existing homes were generally some-
what more liberal than in June or in most other recent months.
Some change in market tone is suggested by recent further
increases in private investor sales of Government-underwritten
mortgages in the secondary market to the Federal National Mortgage
Association. These increases have been from very low earlier levels,
however, and in August the total was still far below pre-1963 peaks.

The number of foreclosures on nonfarm properties, mainly homes,
rose further in the second quarter of the year. The year-to-year
increase -- 6 per cent -- was the smallest, however, in recent years,
apparently because of improved loan screening by lenders, further
increases in consumer incomes and other factors.
Stock market. Average stock prices, as measured by Standard
and Poor's index of 500 common stocks have advanced about 3 per cent
this month. At the September 21 close of 89.81, they were about 10 per
cent above the late June low and only 0.5 per cent below the record high
reached in mid-May. Trading volume in recent weeks has been extremely
heavy, and last week averaged more than 7 million shares per day -- con-
siderably above the daily average of 5.5 to 6.0 million that accompanied rising
prices earlier in the year. Unlike the earlier period when heavy trading
tended to take place on days of rapid price change, recent high activity
has been recorded on many days when broad price indexes have shown slight
movement. This may suggest some quickening of speculative tempo in the

U.S. balance of payments. The U.S. payments deficit on
regular transactions in July and August (combined) after rough allowance
for seasonal variation was at a rate approximately equal to the average
in the first half of this year, a $1-1/4 billion annual rate.
A further large reflow of U.S. short-term loans and acceptance
credits in July, as well as reflows of liquid funds reported by both
banks and nonbank concerns, helped to hold down the payments deficit
in that month. A rise in exports in July also benefitted the payments
position; exports, apparently little affected by the seamen's strike,
were up 3 per cent from June to an annual rate of $27.2 billion. The
July import figure was down 9 per cent from June to a level of $20.0
billion, but the extent to which U.S. payments for imports were reduced
is unknown: one-third of the July decline resulted from a change in
statistical reporting procedures, and much of the remainder reflected
delays in unloadings related to the strike.
Balance of payments data for the first half show improvement as
compared with rates for the full year 1964 in U.S. short-term private
capital flows (a shift of $3.7 billion at an annual rate) and in errors
and omissions (a shift of $0.8 billion), and deterioration in the balance
on goods and services ($1.5 billion at an annual rate) and in flows of
direct and long-term portfolio investment ($1 billion at an annual rate).
The improvement on short-term capital account reflected the
very substantial reduction in net outflows of bank credits and the
reflows of liquid funds (in contrast to sizable outflows of both types

IV -2
of capital last year) which have already been publicized in reports
on the voluntary program.
The reduction in the U.S. surplus on goods and services
stemmed from the large rise in imports and consequent reduction in the
trade surplus, partly offset by an increase of about 20 per cent in
investment income.
The increased net outflow on direct and portfolio investment
reflected foreigners' sales of U.S. corporate securities (primarily for
official British account) and, more important, continued very high U.S.
direct investment outflows.

As shown in the first line of the table, direct investment
outflow in the second quarter, seasonally adjusted, remained well above
last year's rate. In both the first and second quarters, direct invest-
ment outflows were swollen by the bunching of several large transactions.
These included: payments on oil leases on new concessions; provision
of funds by oil companies to enable subsidiaries to make tetroactive tax
payments under renegotiated agreements with Middle Eastern countries;

IV -3
and the takeover of a Canadian finance company whose debts to U.S.
lenders were assumed by the U.S. company that made the acquisition
(with little net effect on the balance of payments). However, direct
investment has frequently been characterized by special transactions,
and the second quarter outflow, even apart from the special transactions,
must be regarded as surprisingly large. Even if there is a sizable
reduction in outflows over the balance of the year, it is likely that
the total for the year will be significantly larger than earlier estimates
had indicated.
Credit conditions and interest rates in Europe. Following the
large rises in British and German long-term interest rates from last
spring through July, a sharp easing in British long-term Government
bond yields in August and early September (despite continued credit
restraint) reflected an important change for the better in market atti-
tudes. In Germany, on the other hand, continued pressures on the bond
market necessitated a moratorium on new issues; short-term interest
rates advanced further in Germany during August and early September.
Credit conditions have continued easy in Italy and tight in the
Netherlands.
In Britain, increasing scarcity of bank credit was a factor
in a marked increase in the flow of new corporate security issues in
July-August. Nevertheless, in the market for Government bonds a less
pessimistic view began to be taken about Britain's balance of payments
problem after the Government's decision in late July to cut back public
and private investment spending. After the publication of the July

IV -4
export figures, bond prices rose sharply. This change in attitudes
was strengthened by the September 2 announcement of the early warning
system for wage and price increases, and by the September 10 announce-
ment of foreign central banks' commitments to help defend sterling in
case the need should arise. The yield on War Loan dropped from 6.84
per cent on August 6 to 6.35 per cent on September 17.
Bank credit has continued to show the effects of the various
measures of restraint taken earlier. Outstanding advances, seasonally
adjusted, declined slightly further in June-August following the down-
turn last May. In the consumer credit field, a new stiffening of terms
was introduced on July 27, when the maximum repayment period was
shortened from 36 to 30 months. On June 3, minimum downpayments had
been raised, a move which helped to slow the expansion of consumer
credit in June and July.
On the other hand, as the building societies have received an
inflow of new funds since they raised their deposit rates in early June,
these institutions expect to increase their loan volume in the coming
months.
Since just after the reduction of Bank Rate from 7 to 6 per
cent on June 3, the 3-month Treasury bill rate has shown little change;
in mid-September it was 5.44 per cent. In the week to Sept. 17, the
rate on new local authority deposits dropped from 6.56 to 6.31 per cent.
The forward discount on sterling in the past week has been 1.9 per cent
per annum, compared with about 2-1/2 per cent during most of August.
In Germany, pressures on the bond market, especially from govern-
mental borrowers, became so intense as to necessitate a moratorium

IV -5
on new issues after July 29. Short-term interest rates have moved up
further, and the discount rate was raised in mid-August.
Average yields on 6 per cent public authority bonds, which
had already reached 7.21 per cent at end-May, rose further to 7.61 per
cent on July 27, when they were nearly 1 percentage point higher than
at the close of last year. On July 28, the Cabinet imposed a mora-
torium on new bond issues, and discussions were initiated on ways to
cut back the borrowing demands of the local governments, states, and
Federal Government agencies. A decline in yields then ensued. But
after the moratorium was formally lifted at the beginning of September,
the announcement of a large new loan by the Railways pushed the yield
average for 6 per cent public authority bonds up again to its earlier
high. A de facto extension of the moratorium followed: the Railways
loan was postponed indefinitely, and only one small new bond issue
was authorized for September. Major public borrowers are now consult-
ing on future financing.
In the short-term money market, the rate on 90-day inter-
bank loans rose further to 5.25 per cent on August 13, and to 5.38 in
mid-September. On August 13, the Bundesbank raised its discount rate
from 3-1/2 to 4 per cent, and the rate on advances from 4-1/2 to 5 per
cent.
In other European countries, changes in money market conditions
during the summer were largely, but perhaps not wholly, of seasonal
character. In August, markets eased at least seasonally in most
countries.

IV -6
In Italy, the balance of payments surplus, swollen by
seasonal receipts from tourists added to bank liquidity. With
encouragement from the authorities, the banks increased their liquid
assets abroad it June, July and August. Through June, the demand for
bank loans remained almost static, and the banking system was con-
tinuing to add rapidly to its bond holdings. Changes in bond yields
were negligible in June-July.
In France, bond yields declined in midsummer, and the money
market eased seasonally in August. Yields on public sector bonds
dropped 10 basis points from mid-June to mid-July, and since then
have fluctutated narrlowly around the 5.70 per cent level (net of a
10 per cent withholding tax). Corporate bond yields have been stable
since the end of July at a level 15 basis points lower than in mid-
June. The money market remained seasonally tight in June and July,
but since early August day-to-day money has generally been 3-1/2 per
cent (equal to the basic discount rate). The banks' liquid asset
reserve requirement was accordingly raised in August from 34 per
cent to the normal 36 per cent.
The Swiss money market also eased in August, partly because
of inflows of foreign exchange and partly because the central bank
supplied funds to the market. The 3-month deposit rate dropped to
3.69 per cent on August 27, its lowest level since early June.
Government bond yields moved up about 3 basis points in June-August.
In the Netherlands, yields on Treasury bills and on out-
standing government bonds rose further in June and July, but by early

IV -7
September had fallen back to end-May levels. Yields on new bond
issues were reportedly at record high levels in August. Central
government and municipal borrowing requirements are expected to
prolong the recent strains on the capital market.
In the London Euro-dollar market, rates declined more than
seasonally throughout the summer, reaching their lowest point on
September 3, when the 90-day rate was 4-3/8 per cent, compared with
a peak of 5-1/4 per cent in May and a level of 4-1/4 per cent a year
ago. Subsequent increases have been small. The Italian banks were
important suppliers of funds to the market, and the British local
authority deposit rate was low enough -- given the discount on
forward sterling -- to influence banks in London to switch some of
the funds they had been employing in the local authority market back
into the Euro-dollar market. On the side of use of funds, U.S. bank
branches continued to draw from the Euro-dollar market in August
and added to their balances at head offices as they had in June-July.
Credit conditions in Canada. Interest rates have risen
in Canada under the two-pronged impact of a vigorous upsurge in
demands for funds and reduced supplies of credit from the United States.
Short-term money rates in Canada, which had been falling
earlier this year, began to move up in April, and by mid-September
were 50 to 70 basis points above April levels. The latest yields
are 4.11 per cent on Treasury bills and 5 per cent on finance company
paper. A sharp rise in bank credit, particularly in the second
quarter, and in consumer credit extended by non-bank institutions,

IV -8
indicate that expanding credit demands were a major cause of the in-
crease in rates. New bond issues have been much larger this year than
in 1964.
On the supply side, Canadian money markets have been adversely
affected by changes in flows of short-term funds from U.S. investors
since the start of the U.S. balance of payments program. U.S. invest-
ments in Canadian money market paper were probably reduced sharply
between February and June. However, a withdrawal of $700 million of
U.S.-owned U.S.-dollar deposits from Canadian banks between end-January
and end-June does not appear to have affected Canadian markets, having
been financed by a drawdown of the Canadian banks' U.S.-dollar assets
in London and New York.
Canadian government bond yields rose by 15 to 40 basis points
from the end of April to mid-August. In subsequent weeks there was
little change in yields on longer-term bonds, but yields on short bonds
fell off.

APPENDIX A: THE STEEL AGREEi4ENT *
The new steel contract has been valued by the Council of Eco-
nomic Advisers at 48 cents or a rate of increase in hourly compensation
of 3.2 per cent per year--the current guidepost figure--and should con-
tribute to continuing stability in unit labor costs in manufacturing
industries. The rate of increase is also about in line with growth in
productivity in the steel industry and labor costs per ton of steel
should not rise. The settlement is more moderate than earlier agree-
ments in such major industries as automobile, can, rubber, and aluminum.
While the new steel pact provides for a somewhat higher increase in
hourly compensation than the 2.5 per cent negotiated in 1962 and 1963,
it is below the 3.7 per cent increase granted in 1960, when manpower
and physical resources were in easier supply than now; it is far below
the 8 per cent annual increase negotiated in 1956.
Although there have been a wide variety of estimates of the
cost of the contract--ranging from 47.3 to 52 cents for the total pack-
age and from 3.2 per cent to 3.7 per cent for average annual increase
in hourly compensation--the Council's method of computation and results
seem reasonable. Differences in pricing out the contract are due to:
a) varying estimates of the size of the package; b) inclusion of the
4-month interim settlement as part of the new contract; and c) compound-
ing the total package to take into account the timing increases go into
effect.
The only detailed breakdown of the contract has come from the
union (see table). Apparently the larger estimates given by the com-
panies reflect their higher valuation of future pension costs. Use of
the lower end of the range of 48 cents by the Council stems, in large
part, from estimates of pension costs prepared by government experts
which found that even the lower union figures probably overestimate
such costs. They would price the total package 3 -5 cents below the
union figure of 47.3 cents.
Each worker had credited to him under the interim settlement,
starting May 1, an 11.5 cents an hour increase on a base pay of $4.41.
In the final settlement, an increase in wage costs of 13.9 cents an
hour is indicated for September 1, but this is not on top of the
earlier increase. The employer pays out on the average only 2.4 cents
an hour more per worker than he did in the previous four months. The
only reasonable approach is to include the 11.5 cents per hour as part
of a 39-month contract as the Council has done. Compounding and pric-
ing the contract by taking into account the time when the wage or fringe
increase goes into effect are more accurate than a simple average of
costs spread evenly over the duration of the contract and this is also
consistent with the guidepost concept.

Labor and Trade Section, Division of Research and Statistics.

Although the total cost is less, most of the basic provisions
in the new steel contract are similar to the ones negotiated earlier in
the aluminum industry. Pensions are increased substantially and volun-
tary early retirement after 30 years of service is also provided. Pen-
sions and other fringe benefits account for almost half the value of
both contracts. Wage increases are confined to the first and last year
of the contracts (the last previous wage increases in steel and alumi-
num were in 1961). However, the steel agreement provides an additional
wage increase of 14.6 cents an hour for those highly skilled workers
who are not covered by incentive programs.
The steel companies successfully opposed any new cost-of-liv-
ing adjustments in the new contract. Earlier the union had argued that,
in addition to productivity gains, some allowance for increases in con-
sumer prices should be made to maintain "real" wages--cost-of-living
clauses had been eliminated from steel contracts in 1962. The companies
were also able to obtain greater flexibility in the handling of vacation
schedules in order to limit any future concentration of vacations among
skilled seniority workers on extended vacations. Hiring of additional
skilled workers during vacation periods have been necessary and appar-
ently costly to the companies in the past two years of high production.
The steel agreement should contribute to keeping increases in
hourly compensation in other settlements this year close to the rise in
economy-wide productivity. Many metal fabricating companies are cur-
rently or soon will be negotiating with the Steelworkers Union. They
generally are expected to accept the pattern of the steel contracts.
However, the union has been following a policy of settling with some
lower-profit fabricators for less than that for steel mills in order to
keep these companies competitive.
The impact of the settlement outside of steel and related
industries should also be significant. Companies entering negotiations
will not have an important precedent for negotiating an inflationary
settlement. Increases above the guidepost average in the near future
will undoubtedly occur, but they are unlikely to be pattern-setting in
the sense that a steel settlement might have been.

APPENDIX B: SOME SPECIAL CCMMENTS ON THE INVENTORY SITUATION*
For the purpose of indicating some major factors in the
cyclical position of the economy two charts of components of the in-
dustrial production index have been prepared which may help account
for the rapid expansion in business inventories and bank credit since
last autumn.
In the upper panel an approximation of a measure of output
of materials for further industrial processing is provided by subtracting
construction materials and general business supplies from the published
component of the index for materials. This measure represents about
four-fifths of all materials and is 34 per cent of the total index. Since
both output and inventories relative to final sales of goods were
apparently adequate in 1962-63, that period is used as a comparison base.
Owing to possible revision in the production series and for
other reasons no precise value should be attached to the exact amount
of the rise in the margin of about 8 per cent to July shown between
maturities and final products output over the past year and a half.
In each postwar period of cyclical expansion a margin of 5 per cent or
more has developed as output and stocks of industrial materials have
increased more than final products. In the subsequent readjustments in
1960, 1958, 1954, and 1949 output of materials declined about twice as
much as final products with an average of about 14 per cent.
In addition to this possible imbalance in materials output,
there has been little further growth so far this year in the indicated
rate of final takings of consumer goods. Consequently, in addition to
the advanced level of output of materials for processing versus outrut
of final products, there has been a sizable margin between output of
autos and other major consumer goods and their rate of final sales.
Manufacturers' and distributors' stocks of these goods have risen 14 per
cent in the past six months.
In the bottom panel of the chart a comparison is made of steel
output and activity in the final steel consuming industries in manufacturing.
For this purpose output of the fabricated metal products group is not
included partly because intermediate metal products were probably also
stockpiled in considerable volume in anticipation of a steel strike,
settlement of which was deferred by four months. Consumption of steel
in the construction industry can not be adequately represented so that,
as in the case of the other chart, for reasons of coverage, weights, and
other considerations no precise meaning should be inferred from the
differences shown.
* Prepared by Clayton Gehman, Chief, Business Conditions Section,
Division of Research and Statistics.

B -2
During the earlier periods of steel inventory adjustments,
after prospective steel strikes did not materialize, there were declines
in steel output of about one-fourth in the second quarter of 1962 and
the third quarter of 1963. This time the expansion in steel inventories
has been larger in both absolute and relative terms than before, although
possibly not as much as in 1960, when steel output was halved and a
general recession in industrial activity developed. Marked increases
in retail sales and output consumer goods could moderate the current
decline in steel inventories.

APPENDIX C: REVISION OF RETAIL TRADE INVENTORIES*
The regular annual adjustment by Commerce Department of monthly
retail trade inventory figures to year-end benchmark levels obtained from
the Census survey, 1964 Retail Trade, has resulted in a substantial upward
revision of retail trade inventory figures for 1964 and 1965 and, through
them, of total business inventories.
The book value of retail trade--and total business-- inventories
was raised by $1.5 billion in December 1964, the key date in the revision,
and this increase was "wedged" back to January 1964. A small additional
increase in level was added in early 1965. Thus, in June 1965, the book
value of retail trade--and total business--inventories has been revised
upward by close to $1.7 billion.
The main effect on the indicated rate of accumulation was, of
course, throughout 1964. The old retail trade inventory figures had
shown a book value increase of only $240 million from December 1963 to
December 1964; the increase now is $1,750 million. The indicated total
business inventory accumulation during 1964 was raised correspondingly,
from $3.9 billion to $5.4 billion. These revised figures were incorporated
in the recent GNP revision: nonfarm business inventory accumulation now
totals $5.4 billion during 1964, up from the earlier $3.6 billion.
The upward revision (the counterpart of the downward bias in
the original monthly figures) was greatest for all the durable goods
categories and, among nondurable outlets, for department stores. The

following table shows, in both absolute and relative terms, the revised
and old increases or decreases in book value of inventories from the end
of 1963 to the end of 1964, by class of retail store:

With this large upward revision of inventories, stock-sales ratios
have of course been raised for the period affected. For all retail trade,
stock-sales ratios are now shown to have been about stable in 1964 and 1965
at the average 1962-63 level, instead of declining appreciably. And,
consequently, the total business stock-sales ratio shows less decline than
earlier in 1964 and 1965.
