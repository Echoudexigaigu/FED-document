SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK
Outlook for demands, output, and prices
In early 1966 sharply expanding Federal expenditures and
business capital outlays will be contributing to further expansion in
production, employment, and incomes, and to a further reduction in
unemployment. Moreover, State and local government expenditures
are increasing somewhat faster than earlier and the large drop in the
rate of business accumulation in the current quarter is likely to be
reversed in the first quarter as steel inventory liquidation tapers off.
The recently reported step-up in administrative budget
expenditures for this fiscal year to a possible total of $105 billion
would imply cash expenditures of $133 billion. This expenditure level,
together with our latest estimate of receipts, would result in an
increase in the cash deficit to $5.2 billion. However, the implicit
rate of increase in expenditures from here on out is so high as to be
questioned. If expenditures do rise as now suggested, the fiscal stimulus
in the first half of 1966 will be slightly larger than in the second
half of 1965, despite the scheduled boost in social security taxes.
Estimates of business spending for fixed capital in the third
quarter have been raised substantially and the increase projected for
the fourth quarter is somewhat larger than reported earlier. The increase
for the year 1965 is now shown by the Commerce-SEC survey to be 15.4
per cent, instead of 13.4 per cent as indicated previously. Business
plans call for a further rise in expenditures in the first half of 1966
at a rate about as rapid as this year.

1-2
Altogether, GNP is still expected to rise at an annual rate
of $11.5 billion in the current quarter, and by about $12 billion in the
first quarter, to a level of $701 billion or so. The increase in real
GNP is likely to be sufficient to result in further tightening of the
labor market, and -- in conjunction with an expansion of the armed
forces -- in further declines in the unemployment rate. Even though
acceleration in wage increases will be inhibited by long-term contracts
in most major industries, wages outside of the highly organized industries
could be larger than earlier because of lessened availability of man-
power. Given the spending and employment outlook, prices, which have
continued so far to rise selectively and moderately, could come under
some increased upward cost and demand pressures, although accelerating
growth in manufacturing capacity may be a tempering influence.
Bank loans
Business loan expansion picked up slightly in November,
although remaining within the range that has prevailed since midsummer.
In recent months, business loan growth has been tempered by liquidation
of steel inventories and the higher pace of capital market financing.
However, total bank loan expansion has accelerated in the past two
months from third-quarter rates, reflecting in large part an unusual
bulge in security loans.
Even with recent increases in the discount and prime rates,
it is likely that business demands on banks will strengthen further
over the next few weeks. Immediate mid-December pressures will be
increased by large tax and dividend payments at a time when corporate

I-3
liquidity is reduced. After the turn of the year, the moderating effect
on bank loan demand of the steel inventory liquidation will taper off.
Furthermore, it is possible that some temporary increase in loan demand
at banks will result from reluctance to undertake long-term borrowing
in the current uncertain market atmosphere. Over the long run, however,
increases in bank loan rates may well make capital market financing more
attractive relative to bank loans.
Bank deposits. Strong loan demands and growing transaction
needs for money should support further private demand deposit expansion
in the weeks ahead at near the average of recent months. While time
and savings deposit growth could pick up as a consequence of the recent
change in Regulation Q, a smaller upsurge is expected than followed the
previous increases in ceiling rates. The permissible rate on passbook
savings has not been changed this time. And if, as suggested below,
corporate CD demand does not expand sharply, the only time deposits
that may grow more rapidly -- probably at the expense of nonbank finan-
cial institutions -- are nonnegotiable savings and investment certificates
sold to individuals.
Banks face CD maturities this month over $1 billion larger
than in December of last year. While the increase in Regulation Q
ceilings will make it easier for banks to roll over their maturing
CD's through higher offering rates, they may still find it takes
longer to rebuild their outstandings than previously. Corporate demand
for CD's may be more restrained as a result of rising demands on
internal funds. Large January CD maturities and new Treasury cash

1-4
financings in the next few weeks will also add to the difficulties
facing banks in the sale of their CD's.
Securities markets
In long-term markets, bond yields were generally marked 5 to
10 basis points higher in initial response to the increase in the discount
rate. At the same time, bill rates rose 15 to 25 basis points, and the
3-month bill was auctioned at 4.34 per cent following the discount rate
announcement. Market reaction was moderated by ample reserve avail-
ability. On the second day of trading after the announcement, both
short- and long-term markets settled down and bond yields declined
somewhat from their previous day's highs.
The course of government security yields through the early
weeks of 1966 will be affected, on the one hand, by the usual seasonal
tendency for rates to decline with the enlarged flow of investment funds
after the turn of the year and, on the other hand, by the larger than
usual Federal cash borrowing now expected in January.
In the corporate market, demands for long-term external
financing are likely to continue to expand to meet projected large
business investment outlays, but over the next few weeks corporate bond
offerings may be moderate. At yield levels now emerging, expectations
of further rate advances may diminish, which would lead to a cut back
in anticipatory borrowing and to reduced pressure on corporate rates.
An underlying tendency to shift business borrowing toward the capital
market, however, should develop in consequence of the increase in the
prime rate,

I -5
In the municipal market, further interest rate adjustments may
be moderated by the greater leeway afforded commercial banks.under the
new Regulation Q ceilings. This should help to relieve some of the
recent strain on bank investment positions and obviate the need of further
secondary market liquidation of municipals by individual banks -- which
has reportedly been occurring recently in some volume.
In mortgage markets, rates and terms may continue to firm.
With the prime rate at commercial banks and corporate bond yields both
higher, long-term lenders are likely to seek higher mortgage rates as
well. Moreover, flows of savings to specialized mortgage lenders such
as savings and loan associations and mutual savings banks may be under
further pressure, especially if commercial banks begin aggressively
to merchandise higher yielding savings certificates and savings bonds
to individuals. The mortgage market may receive some support, however,
if FNMA holds the line on secondary market purchase prices and expands
its purchases even further.
Foreign developments and the balance of payments
The increase in Federal Reserve discount rates was followed
immediately by an increase in the Bank of Canada's rate. Pressures
of demand upon available resources of labor and industrial capacity are
very strong in Canada. In Britain, an early cut in Bank rate now appears
even less likely than before. On the European Continent, domestic
objectives at present almost certainly rule out discount rate increases
in France, Italy, and Belgium. A rise in the German discount rate is
possible in view of continuing demand pressures and rapid increases in

1 -6
German wage rates. On the other hand, the German authorities recognize
that efforts to tighten further their already stringent credit policy
could provoke undesired capital inflows, and that such inflows would
tend to weaken the force of restrictive measures.
In the Euro-dollar market, the usual December rise in rates
received an extra push from the announcement of the Federal Reserve
rate change. As of Wednesday, rates for 30-day and longer periods were
up by 3/8 of one per cent from last Friday.
Further data now suggest that the fourth-quarter deficit on
"regular transactions" will probably be below the $440 million average
of the first three quarters. As no large debt prepayments are coming
in during this quarter, the deficit may be about as large as the
average for the earlier period on the "liquidity" basis; and since short-
term liabilities to commercial banks abroad are apparently not rising
much if any this quarter, the balance will certainly be less favorable
than before on the "official settlemtnts" basis.
Direct investment outflows in the third quarter now appear
to have been much smaller than in the first two quarters. Neverthe-
less, the total for the year will be well over $3 billion. The third-
quarter cutback, coming as it did after a great outpouring in the first
half year, throws little light on prospects for achieving the goal
recently announced by the Department of Commerce, of getting direct
investment outflows in 1966 down to the 1964 level of $2.4 billion.

THE ECONOMIC PICTURE IN DETAIL
The Nonfinancial Scene
Gross national product. Ebullient business plans for fixed
investment, acceleration of the rise in Federal defense expenditures,
and a step-up in the rate of increase in employment and wage and
salary income in October and November all confirm the prospect of
another large rise in GNP in the current quarter. Continued rapid ex-
pansion in Federal outlays and in business fixed investment is in prospect
for the first quarter of 1966 and these developments play a major role
in further large gains in employment and incomes and in consumer spending.
Moreover, the rate of inventory accumulation is likely to recover in
early 1966 as steel liquidation tapers off. Altogether, GNP is projected
to rise at an annual rate of $11.5 billion in the current quarter and by
$12 billion in the first quarter, continuing the rapid pace of advance
now recorded for the third quarter of this year.
Business has just reported in a Commerce-SEC survey a much
higher level of plant and equipment outlays for the third quarter than
had been estimated earlier (these are not yet incorporated in the GNP
figures) and has also raised its sights for such spending in the current
quarter and in the first half of next year. It appears that the rate of
business fixed investment to GNP will rise close to that at the peak of
the investment boom of 1955-57.
Federal defense expenditures have been mounting rapidly and a
rise of nearly $3 billion in the annual rate is now estimated for total
Federal purchases of goods and services in the current quarter, as

II -2
compared with an earlier estimate of $2.2 billion. (It should be noted
that total Federal expenditures are estimated to be up only $1.3 billion
because of the sharp drop in transfer payments after the third-quarter
bulge in social security payments.) The fourth-quarter increase has
been augmented by military and civilian pay raises, and a much smaller
increase is projected for Federal purchases in the first quarter. The
first-quarter increase is lower than that implied by fiscal year administra-
tive budget expenditures of $105 billion.
The fourth-quarter estimate of consumption expenditures and,
in particular, nondurable goods outlays has been lowered somewhat as
retail sales appear to have lagged moderately in November. However,
the increase for the quarter is still expected to exceed the rise in
disposable income, in part owing to the spill-over effects on this
quarter's spending of the large lump sum payment of retroactive social
security benefit increases in the third quarter.
In the first quarter, a further sizable gain is projected in
consumer disposable income despite the boost in social security taxes
effective January 1. Continuing large gains in wages and salaries are
projected and these will be supplemented by another spurt in Federal
transfer payments to persons (veterans' life insurance dividends, higher
pensions and social security benefits, and increased payments under the
anti-poverty program). Personal consumption expenditures are projected
to rise as much as disposable income, with the result that the savings
rate holds at the fourth-quarter level of 5.3 per cent.
A rise in GNP at the rate of $11.0 to $12 billion a quarter is,
after allowance for continuing price advances at about the recent rate,

expected to continue to result in employment increases in excess of growth
in the labor force with a consequent continuing downdrift in unemployment.
Moreover, soe downward pressure on unemployment is also resulting from
the expansion in the armed forces and from the anti-poverty program.
Industrial production. Industrial production in November is
now estimated to have increased to a level above the July-August record
of 144.3, from the preliminary October figure of 143.6. For the fourth
quarter as a whole the index now appears likely to exceed moderately the
143.9 average for the third quarter.
Weekly data, except for steel, indicate increases or continued
high levels of production in November. Production worker manhours -- the
basis for our output indexes in a number of industries -- rose considerably
further last month to a 10 year high. Increases were widespread in both
durable and nondurable goods manufacturing. Also indicative of production
developments in November and later, new orders received by durable goods
producers reached a record high in October and the backlog of unfilled
orders continued to expand.
Steel ingot production, seasonally adjusted, was unchanged in
November following sharp reductions in September and October, but output
of steel mill products apparently continued to decline. Inventories of
steel held by users declined 7 per cent in October, but at the end of
the month were still 30 per cent above the peaks in 1962 and 1963. The
effect of the November decline in steel output on total industrial pro-
duction, however, was less than in September and October when steel declines
amounted to 1.0 point and 0.6 point, respectively, in the total production
index.

II -5
Auto assemblies continued strong and were at an annual rate of
about 9.3 million units in November, and December schedules are presently
set at a 9.5 million rate. Television production, sparked by strong
demand for color sets, continued to rise. Output of equipment, both
business and defense, also increased further last month.
Retail sales. Retail sales appear to have declined in November --
at both durable and nondurable goods stores -- following a pronounced
spurt in October. For durable goods, the decline was centered in
furniture and appliance stores. Sales of auto dealers increased in
dollar volume following a decline in October; a similar pattern was shown
by unit auto sales which rose to a 9 million annual rate for domestic
autos from 8.4 million in October. Declines were widespread among
nondurable goods stores in November following strong increases in
September and October.
Recent sales indications may be subject to more revision than
usual in the light of a major overhaul of the probability sample of
retail stores now underway at the Census Bureau. In the final report
for October, which will be delayed about one month, the Census Bureau
will report revised retail sales figures on the new sample basis begin-
ning with January 1964. In the meantime, the advance monthly report
for November (due in a few days) and the weekly figures for December
will continue on the old sample basis.
Consumer credit. Expansion in total consumer instalment debt
slewed markedly in October, as demands for both auto credit and personal
loans were at their lowest level of the year. The seasonally adjusted.

11 -6
annual rate of instalment debt increase was only a little over $7
billion, compared with about $8 billion in the first three quarters.
The slower credit growth in October is expected to be temporary.
The slackening in auto credit in October may have been a
reaction to the bulge in September when there were very large sales of
1965 models and a correspondingly large rise in credit buying. With the
availability of the new models in October, cash buying surged again
as it usually does on the new model introduction. The change in the mix
of auto sales also may have dampened personal loan demand in October in
view of a trend to increasing use of personal loans to purchase cars and
other major durable goods.
There was a sharp increase in nonauto goods credit in October,
and this provided a partial offset to the slowdown in auto and personal
loans. Partly this reflects continuing strong sales of "big ticket"
durable goods -- especially color TV -- on credit. But even the small
durables frequently are purchased through use of revolving credit accounts
at department and other retail stores. The amount of revolving credit
outstanding has nearly doubled since 1961; in fact, two-thirds of in-
stalment credit held by department stores is now in this form.
Repayments on instalment debt moved up again in October, about
in line with the long-term trend. The October annual rate was $68.6
billion, up from $61.2 billion in October 1964. The ratio of repayments
to disposable personal income reached 14.4 per cent in the third quarter,
up from 13.9 per cent a year earlier.
Consumer expectations. According to the most recent Census
quarterly survey of consumer buying intentions, new car demands will

II -7
be as strong during the 1966 model year as they had been for 1965
models. In mid-October, 10.6 per cent of households reported plans to
buy new autos over the coming 12 months as compared with 10.4 per cent
reporting similar intentions in October 1964 and with 8.9 per cent in
October 1963, Used car buying plans were also as numerous as they had
been a year earlier.
For major household durable goods, intentions to purchase
within 6 months showed more than the usual seasonal rise from July to
a level in mid-October slightly higher than a year ago. Plans to buy
television sets were particularly strong.
The number of households reporting higher incomes than a
year earlier and the number expecting higher incomes a year hence
were both significantly larger this October than in October 1964.
Plant and equipment expenditures. Business outlays for new
plant and equipment this year, at $51.8 billion, will be 15.4 per cent
larger than last year, according to the Commerce-Securities and Exchange
Commission survey of business investment intentions conducted in November.
The preceding survey, conducted in August, had projected a rise of 13.4
per cent this year. Thus, the November survey indicates business
investment has been a stronger factor in overall demand than earlier
indicated.
Fixed capital outlays increased by 4.8 per cent in the third
quarter -- in contrast to the 1.6 per cent rise shown in the August survey.
A rise of 4.0 per cent is now indicated for the current quarter, as
compared with a 3.5 per cent increase shown in August.

In the first two quarters of 1966, increases in fixed capital
outlays are expected to continue large. The increases are now estimated
at 13.5 per cent annual rate for the first quarter and 15.2 per cent
for the second quarter of 1966. These are much faster rates of expansion
than the 8 per cent reported by the McGraw-Hill October survey for the
year 1966.
Manufacturers anticipate a pronounced slowdown in the rise in
spending in the first quarter but resumption of a rapid pace of advance
in the second quarter. Much of the large rise in total business fixed
capital spending in the first quarter is expected to result from
unusually sharp increases by transportation and public utility companies.

Construction activity. Expenditures on new construction edged
upward in November, but remained somewhat below the September high and
the third quarter average. While private residential expenditures have
tended downward since midyear, private nonresidential expenditures have
generally continued to rise, and have tempered the downdrift for the
private sector as a whole. This pattern continued in November as private
construction expenditures held at the moderately reduced October rate.
Public construction put in place has continued to fluctuate
at a record level in recent months. Preliminary figures, however,
remain uncertain especially for highways. While the November rate is
reported to be up appreciably, this followed a 4 per cent downward
revision for October.

Orders for durable goods. New orders for durable goods in
September and October were larger than advance figures had indicated
owing mainly to upward revision of defense orders. September now
about equals the July high and October new orders rose one per cent to
a new record level.
In October new orders for steel recovered from the sharp
dip in September; while they equalled August, they were down about 35
per cent from the February high and were well below shipments. Defense
orders in October remained close to the advanced September level, and
new orders for machinery and equipment increased moderately.
Durable goods shipments have shown little change in recent
months and the recent burst in defense ordering led to a step-
up in the rate of increase in the durable order backlog in September
and October. Over the 8-month period from February through October, the
backlog of unfilled orders for durable goods increased 10 per cent, or as
much as in the preceding 8 months, despite the reversal of the earlier
rapid buildup in the steel backlog.

The ratio of unfilled orders to shipments is typically much
higher in defense than in other durable goods industries, and the recent
large concentration of ordering in defense industries has been a major
factor in the rise in overall durable goods orders from the 2.6 month's
backlog prevailing in 1962-64 to 2.9 month's in October. In the year
1956, this ratio averaged 4.2.
Business inventories. The first reading on business inventories
for October -- only available for manufacturing -- supports the expec-
tation that the overall rate of accumulation, which had tended downward
earlier in the year, will show a sizable further decline in the fourth
quarter. The decline will be centered in manufacturing; the rate of
accumulation of trade inventories which was very low in the third quarter
is likely to pick up in the current quarter. We are continuing to
estimate that, on a GNP basis, total inventory accumulation will be at
an annual rate of $4.2 billion in the fourth quarter as compared with
$6.1 billion reported for the third quarter.
The book value of manufacturers' inventories increased
$267 million in October, half the monthly rate of the third quarter.

II -12
As was to be expected with the shift to liquidation of steel stocks,
the rate of accumulation of durable goods was sharply lower. On the
other hand, accumulation of nondurable goods, which had picked up during
the summer from the low first half-year rates, accelerated further in
October.
The durable goods sector in October absorbed a 1.2 million
ton reduction in steel inventories held by metals users and still
reported a book value increase of about $100 million. The persistence
of overall accumulation in the face of a high rate of liquidation
of steel inventories reflectedin large part mounting inventory
requirements in the strongly expansive defense and business equipment
industries. The only major industry reporting an appreciable reduction
in inventories was the auto industry; in other consumer durable lines
inventories continued about unchanged.

Labor market. The labor market picked up momentum in
November. Nonfarm employment advanced more rapidly than in any month

II -13
this year with significant gains reported in all major groups. In
manufacturing the rise in employment was the largest this year and the
work week rose further to an average of 41.4 hours, well above the first
quarter high, according to revised data.
Responding to the rising demand for workers and increases in
the armed forces, labor force growth continued to exceed official pro-
jections by substantial amounts. Nevertheless, employment gains were
again greater than labor force additions and unemployment declined to
4.2 per cent from 4.3 per cent in October and 4.9 per cent in November 1964.
Nonfarm employment increased by almost 300,000 in November
and was 2.4 million above a year earlier. Adding to the continued
large gains in trade, and public and private services was an increase
of 115,000 in manufacturing. Metals industries were especially strong,
reflecting, in part, a halt in cutbacks in steel employment. Meanwhile,
employment gains accelerated in the transportation equipment industry
reflecting high auto output and a step-up in aircraft production. In
addition, employment in the machinery and electrical equipment industries
continued to advance rapidly as orders and expenditures for capital
investment were raised. In most nondurable goods activities employment
showed little change.
In nonmanufacturing, trade, service and State and local
government increased employment by 120,000, about the same high monthly
rate as over the past year. Construction employment which had remained
relatively stable since early this year, increased by more than 50,000
in November.

II -14
The pattern of change in the average workweek in manufacturing
in 1965 has been altered as a result of a BLS revision. Adjustment to
March 1964 benchmarks and new seasonal factors have reduced the first
quarter workweek from 41.4 to 41.2 hours. Stability at a lower level
thereafter through October in the old series now ends in September.
The new series shows a substantial rise in hours in October and in
November, the workweek increased again to reach a new high for the year
and the highest level since World War II.

Unemployment and labor force. Unemployment continued to edge
downward in almost all groups in November. For men 25 years and over
the rate declined to 2.4 per cent and for married men the rate was 2.0
per cent -- the lowest for these groups since October 1953. Among
teenagers the rate was also lower in November, but at 12.5 per cent it was
a little below the rates reported most of this year. The unemployment
rate for nonwhite workers at 8.2 per cent showed no improvement in November,
although it was down from 9.3 per cent a year ago. The nonwhite unemploy-
ment rate continued more than double that of white workers and for
teenage nonwhite youth the rate remained unchanged at 25 per cent.

II -15
Long-term unemployment declined to a low for this year and was
substantially below a year earlier. More than half of the decline in
unemployment in the past year has been among those who have been out of
work for 15 weeks or more.
Substantial increases in the labor force have been the major
source of workers for expanding employment. In November, for instance,
the total labor force grew by about 300,000 raising the total increase
from a year earlier to 1.7 million. This is well above the growth of
1.35 million projected for this year by the Labor Department. Higher
than expected increases have been evident since July and apparently
reflect continuing strong demands for labor. All of the additions
have been among youth and women, since the adult male labor force has
shown no increase over the past year. About 900,000 youth and 800,000
women have been added to the labor force since November 1964, with
most of the increase, especially among youths, taking place since mid-
summer.
The armed forces increased to 2.8 million in November and
were about 100,000 above the August total prior to the step-up in
draft calls. The armed forces are expected to,reach the currently
planned t6tal of 3,040,000 by the second quarter of 1966.
Wages. Average hourly earnings in manufacturing have continued
to advance moderately, increasing by one cent in November to $2.64
per hour, compared to $2.55 a year ago. For the 11 months of this year,
hourly earnings averaged 3.2 per cent above a year earlier. Weekly
earnings also have increased, in part reflecting longer hours of work.
At $109.30 in November, weekly earnings were $5 above a year earlier.

1/ Change and level based on average of first 9 months this
year, except manufacturing which is for first 11 months.
While the rise in manufacturing wages has not accelerated,
wages in retail trade and many of the lower-paid service industries
have risen more rapidly than earlier and at rates well above the
guideposts. In hotels, motels and laundries, for example, increases
in average hourly earnings have been 5 per cent or more this year and
in retail trade, the rise in the first 9 months of this year was 4.2
per cent above a year earlier. Special reports of wage changes among
other low wage workers for whom regular monthly statistics are not
available, such as hospital attendants, also indicate that their rates
have begun to rise somewhat more rapidly than earlier.
The step-up in wage gains in these industries and occupations
appears to be in response to continued strong demands for workers while
significant reductions have begun to take place in the pool of less
skilled workers. Efforts to catch up to the high wage industries are
typical in a period of extended expansion and favorable labor market
conditions. Recent minimum wage increases may also have contributed
to a limited extent to the larger wage gains. Most of the lower paid
service and trade establishments, however, are not covered by the
Federal minimum wages, and hence, market forces must be considered the

II -17
most important influence. For example, only retail outlets doing a
relatively large volume of business are covered, and all laundries,
except industrial, and all hotels and motels are excluded from minimum
wage coverage.
In general, it is expected, that even if wage increases in
trade and services were in line with guideposts, prices in these sectors
would rise somewhat because productivity gains tend to be below the
total private trend productivity rise of 3.2 per cent now used in the
guideposts. Relatively high rates of increase in wages in trades and
services are thus likely to exert upward pressure on the consumer price
index. Guidepost policy has been largely concentrated on wages in the
heavy industrial and highly organized sectors of the economy and has
mostly ignored developments in trades and services which are little
organized. Consequently, even if wholesale prices of commodities were
held relatively stable by continuation of the guidepost policy, it seems
likely that the consumer price index would continue to move upward.
Wholesale prices. The industrial commodity price index in
recent weeks has continued to edge up at about the rate prevailing since
midyear. At 102.6 per cent of the 1957-59 average at the end of November,
the industrial index was up .5 per cent from midyear and nearly 2 per
cent from the summer of 1964 when the current rise began. Prices of
foodstuffs also have risen in recent weeks to somewhat above the ad-
vanced levels reached last summer, and the total wholesale index has risen
.4 per cent since mid-October to 103.5 per cent of the 1957-59 average.

II -18
Continuing and little-publicized increases in steel prices
have raised the index of finished steel products abbut 1 per cent
above the level in the first half of the year to 104.0 per cent of the
1957-59 average.
Copper and brass producers rescinded price increases after
the Government announced an emergency release of 200,000 tons of copper
from the strategic stockpile and introduced export controls on copper
scrap. It is expected these Government actions will permit the expected
1966 deficit of domestic demand over supply to be met. The 36-day strike --
now ended -- at large Chilean mites has required producers to reduce by
around two-thirds their February shipments of copper to Europe. How
shipments to the United States will be affected is not yet clear. Some
loss of Zambian production has occurred with the blowing up of electric
power transmission lines on the Zambian-Rhodesian border.
Meat prices have remained near last summer's peak levels as
a result of seasonally reduced supplies of beef and larger than seasonal
reductions in hog supplies. Prices of dairy products have risen about
seasonally while egg prices have increased sharply as a result of
reduced laying flocks. Edible oils have risen mainly because of in-
creased export demand, and cocoa prices are continuing to recover from
postwar record lows.
Consumer prices. From mid-September to mid-October the con-
sumer price index rose .2 per cent to 110.4 per cent of the 1957-59
average. Food prices, which usually decline seasonally in October, were
unchanged as increases in eggs and restaurant meals offset decreases

II -19
in meats and fresh fruits and vegetables, Prices of nonfood commodities
advanced .4 per cent, or about seasonally, and prices of services
continued on their persistent upward trends.
The consumer price index has risen somewhat more over the past
year than in earlier years of this expansion, chiefly because of the
sharp rise in food prices last spring when meat supplies declined.
Nonfood commodities have risen little over the year; prices of apparel
and some other nondurable commodities have increased, but autos and
household durables goods generally have declined, in part because of
excise tax reductions. The BLS estimated prices of new 1966 model
cars, after adjustment for quality changes and the excise tax reduction,
to be .8 per cent below comparable 1965 models.

Agricultural situation and outlook. Analysts participating in
the USDA's mid-November Outlook Conference predicted a further gain in
the farm economy in 1966 within the framework of continued rise in over-
all economic activity. For farmers, the year 1965 has been the best
since 1952. Net realized income of $14 billion in 1965 will be $1
billion higher than in 1964 and nearly $2 billion above the average of
the preceding 10 years. The improvement has resulted mainly from very
favorable prices for livestock. Expanding markets, continued strong
livestock prices, and the new farm program are expected to result in
a further increase in realized net income in 1966, possibly of one-
quarter to one-half billion dollars.
The long uptrend in the value of farm assets continued during
1965, and was at a somewhat faster pace than in recent years. Much of
the increase was due to the continued advance in land values but other
physical assets also showed market gains. Value of farm machinery
inventories increased because of continued heavy investment in improved
and heavier equipment; value of the crop inventory increased because
of the record size of 1965 harvests and the resulting larger stocks on
farms on January 1; value of the livestock inventory increased because
of the higher valuation per head.
Farm debts also increased during 1965. The increase of $3.4
billion, to a total of $39.4 billion, was less than the rise in total
assets. As a result farmers net worth increased about 6 per cent to an
estimated total of $212 billion at the end of 1965.

II -21
Consumer expenditures for food in 1965 are estimated to be
6 per cent above 1964, with about half of the inclease reflecting higher
prices. A further but smaller rise in expenditures is expected by the
USDA in 1966. Per capita consumption is expected to hold at about the
1965 level. Meat prices will probably average above 1965, although
pork supplies are expected to increase late in 1966. Larger supplies
and lower prices are in prospect for poultry, potatoes, fresh vegetables,
and fruits. Smaller packs of processed vegetables and deciduous fruits
may result in higher prices for these foods.
November hog marketings were down a fifth from a year earlier
and hog prices were boosted to near record levels for November. Normally
this period of the year is one of seasonally high marketings and corres-
pondingly lower prices. Recent marketings, however, have been far below
expectations. No new information on the hog supply situation will be
available until the release of the Pig Crop Report on December 23.
Earlier reports have shown the spring pig crop now coming to market to
be down 10 per cent and it is now clear that producers are beginning to
withhold hogs to expand breeding stocks. If a substantial expansion
in production is underway, withholding for breeding will probably compete
with marketings for slaughter primarily in November through January.
It is also possible that producers, finding themselves with fewer hogs
and large stocks of new crop corn, some of it of lower quality, are
feeding hogs to heavier weights, although this does not yet show in
reported marketings. Any contraction in marketings due to this
factor, however, would be of short duration.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL SITUATION
Bank credit. Bank credit during November expanded at a 10.8
per cent seasonally adjusted annual rate, using end-of-month figures,
a rate about the same as in October .On an average daily basis, however,
expansion was considerably slower in October -- a 4.3 per cent rate of
increase, as measured by the credit proxy for member banks, as compared
to 13.5 per cent in October. The difference reflects the timing of
the two tax bill financings. In October, bills were delivered the
second week and liquidation did not begin until the last week of the
month. In November, liquidation of Treasury securities continued through-
out the month, but the new bills were delivered on the final reporting
date, and were fully reflected in the end-of-month data.
Business loan growth expanded modestly in November from the
reduced October rate. Over the last two months combined, these loans
rose at a 10.7 per cent rate -- about 1 percentage point below the rate
of the third quarter. While business loans in most industry categories
showed some increase during November, after allowance for seasonal factors,
steel-using industries continued to reduce their loans somewhat more than
seasonally -- reflecting liquidation of inventory.
Business loan demands in the weeks ahead are likely to be large.
Economic expansion continues to be rapid and seasonal needs to finance
tax and dividend payments in mid-December will be greater than last year.
Fourth-quarter dividends -- including extras that reflect higher profits --
are projected to be up substantially. These seasonal needs cannot be
readily shifted elsewhere even though bank loan rates have increased.

III -2
Over the longer run, however, the increase in the prime loan rate to
5 per cent may make capital market financing relatively more attractive
to potential borrowers, even though immediate uncertainties in securities
markets, as they adjust to the discount rate change, could temporarily
encourage borrowing at short-term from banks.
Security loans in November continued to be relatively strong
for the second consecutive month. Such loans were especially strong in
New York and were mainly for purchasing or carrying private securities.
In addition, loans to finance companies have risen in recent weeks, after
earlier declines. This return to bank financing probably reflects the
rescinding of earlier loan rate increases as well as tighter money markets
and higher bond yields. Finance company needs for funds to refinance
maturing commercial paper are expected to be large at midmonth.
Banks reduced net acquisitions of municipal and agency securities
further in November. So far in the fourth quarter total bank holdings
have expanded at an 8.3 per cent annual rate, considerably below the
13.3 per cent growth rate of the third quarter, despite continued large
inflows of time and savings deposits. New York banks have reduced their
holdings much more than seasonally since late September. This general
slowdown probably is due in part to the declining liquidity position of
commercial banks, as well as the need to underwrite Treasury issues in
both October and November.
Bank deposits. So far in the fourth quarter, maintenance of
the growth of private deposits, together with a slower decline in Treasury
balances, has accelerated total deposit growth above the third-quarter rate.

III -3
Total deposits, seasonally adjusted, should continue their growth in
December with Treasury balances expected to show ai seasonally adjusted
expansion, with maintenance of a fairly high growth rate for time and
savings deposits, and with higher transactions demands for money.
In mid-December, individual banks will be faced with large CD
maturities. For the month as a whole, $3.5 billion of CD's will mature --
only $200 to $400 million more than for months with tax and dividend
dates earlier in 1965 but $1.1 billion more than last December. The
proportion of outstandings due this December is up only slightly from
a year ago at banks in New York City, but it is considerably higher at
outside banks. The increase in Regulation Q ceilings will ease the
problem banks face in replacing their maturing CD's. Nevertheless, banks
still may have some difficulty in view of the tighter financial position
of corporations.
On the other hand, even with rate pressures, New York banks
were able to make large CD sales. However, the high level of maturities
last month kept the net increase in outstandings to a low level -- about
$75 million in New York, and about $150 million at other weekly reporters.
In addition, short-term notes outstanding rose $150 million in November
(to a level of over $500 million), with most of the increase in the New
York and Chicago Districts. Presumably, the higher Q ceiling, together
with the shortening of permissible maturities at which they can compete,
will reduce the need and/or desire of banks to use the note market.
Even with only modest net growth in CD's, total time and
savings deposits in November continued to grow as rapidly as in October -
at nearly a 17 per cent rate. The money stock expanded considerably

III -4
slower -- at a 1.4 per cent as opposed to a 9.5 per cent rate -- as money
holdings were reduced to more normal operating levels after the earlier
bulges. So far this year, time deposits and the money stock have ex-
panded at a 16.4 and 4.2 per cent annual rate, respectively; for all of
1964 they grew at a 12.8 and 4.3 per cent rate.
Seasonally adjusted Government balances -- which have been
declining each month since midyear -- are expected to rise substantially
on balance during December, reflecting mainly the Treasury financing in
late November. But even with an increase in Treasury deposits projected
for the month as a whole, a sharp decline in these balances is expected
over the early weeks of Decembet and this may be reflected in a rapid
liquidation by banks of recently acquired tax bills.
Corporate and municipal bond markets. Yields on corporate and
municipal bonds were marked sharply higher in their initial response
to the recent Federal Reserve actions. When the Southern California
Edison Company announced an indefinite postponement of the $75 million
bond originally scheduled for bidding on Tuesday, December 7, however,
yields on investment-grade corporate bonds eased back a little and are
presently about 2 to 4 basis points above levels prevailing at the end
of last week. An initial larger yield advance of 10 basis points or so
on recently offered municipals, however, seems to have been maintained.
During the week prior to announcement of the discount rate
increase, participants in corporate and municipal bond markets became
increasingly doubtful that interest rates could be kept from rising.
With the release of Budget estimates indicating a further rise in Federal

III -5
spending, yields on both corporate and municipal bonds came under con-
siderable upward pressure. The major new corporate bond issue was re-
offered to yield 4.85 per cent, 5 basis points above comparable Aa-rated
new issues in the preceding week, and 17 basis points above yields
on equivalent issues at the recent low in late October. Yields on three
recently offered corporate issues which were released from syndicate rose
10 basis points. In the municipal bond market, the relatively sensitive
Bond Buyer average of seasonal bond yields rose another 3 basis points,
extending its overall advance from mid-October to 12 basis points.

After last week's syndicate terminations in the corporate bond
market, only one recently offered issue remained in syndicate and this
was virtually all sold before the discount rate increase. Thus, with
only minimum market pressures being exerted by older inventories acquired

at lower yields, corporate underwriters are in a good position to bid for
current and prospective new offerings. The volume of new issues already
scheduled for public offering in December, though down seasonally from
November, is larger than a year ago.

At this point the December volume of new municipal bond offerings
seems likely to drop back from the seasonally large November supply. But
in contrast with the corporate market, the technical position of the
municipal market was quite weak at the time of the discount rate change.
Not only did bank acquisitions of municipals occur at a slower pace in
November; some banks were reportedly making sizable block sales in the
secondary market as well. Although the Blue List of advertised dealer
inventories has fluctuated between $650 and $700 million for some time,
dealers have had to cut prices substantially on older inventories in order
to make room for acquisitions of new issues. In the face of sizable losses
on some of these older issues, dealers developed an increasingly cautious
approach to bidding on new offerings.

III -7
Stock market. A very sharp initial decline in stock prices
followed announcement of the discount rate change but was quickly reversed
in continued heavy trading. By the close of the market on Tuesday,
Standard and Poor's index of 500 stocks stood at 91.39, slightly above
the closing level last Friday. Since reaching an all-time high in mid-
November, common stock prices have eased slightly on balance in very
active trading. The index is now about 1 per cent above the Hay high.
Except for this week's brief reaction, the broad index has moved within
a narrow range. In contrast, however, prices of many individual stocks --
especially those of a speculative or glamour variety -- have shown great
volatility.
Trading volume has been consistently heavy. Since mid-November,
trading on the New York Stock Exchange has averaged about 8 million shares
daily, with volume exceeding that figure in 10 of 16 trading sessions and
twice topping 10 million. Somewhat more moderate activity early in
November held the monthly average to 7.4 million shares daily, about the
same as in September and October.
Mortgage markets. For several months mortgage markets have
been showing a gradual shading in tone toward greater firmness. But the
concensus in trade circles seemed to be that terms in early 1966 would
be only moderately different from those which have prevailed recently,
partly reflecting the general expectation of little or no upturn in
residential construction activity next year. Initial reaction to the
discount rate increase by mortgage lenders and builders, however, is that
interest rates and other terms may now show appreciable firming.

III -8
Statistical evidence of the recent change in tone has been
centered mainly in the secondary mortgage markets. Yields on FHA-insured
mortgages in that market rose 3 basis points in October, the sharpest
rise since the autumn of 1959. And Federal National Mortgage Association
purchases of Government-underwritten mortgages increased to the largest
volume for any month since early 1962. At the same time mortgage offerings
by commercial banks and other private holders for purchase by FNMA more
than doubted in October, expanding nearly to the record level reached
in October of 1956. With FNMA holding purchase prices unchanged, both
offerings and purchases are indicated to have risen further during November.
Through the third quarter of this year, underlying adjustments
in mortgage holdings among individual investor groups have been much more
pronounced than shifts in the overall total. As shown in the table, based
on recently revised data, mortgage debt outstanding rose about as much in
the third quarter as in the same period of each of the preceding two years.
Among the major financial institutions, however, only the commercial banks
apparently registered some year-to-year acceleration. Expansion by
savings and loan associations continued to moderate in line with
altered competitive and regulatory factors. For the first time in more
than three years, moreover, net acquisitions by FNMA contributed to the
overall rise.

reached in the second half of 1964, when net expansion in multifamily and
commercial debt was at a high. The rate of expansion in debt on l-to-4
family properties is indicated to have changed relatively little since the
second quarter of 1964.

Net savings flows to depositary-type institutions. In October
net savings inflows to savings and loan associations and mutual savings
banks continued to run below a year ago, whereas time and savings deposits
at commercial banks showed the largest (seasonally unadjusted) monthly
increase of the year. Similarly, for the first 10 months of 1965, growth
in time and savings deposits at commercial banks was more rapid than in
any other year--including 1962. Since some of this growth occurred at
the expense of other depositary-type institutions, however, the rate of
growth in total savings accounts at all such institutions fell short of
the unusual rates of overall acceleration in these flows in 1961 and 1962.
The January-October short-fall in net savings flows to institu-
tions other than commercial banks was most pronounced at savings and loan
associations, where maximum interest rates paid have not risen appreciably
since early 1963. For this reason, the relative share of savings and loan
associations in the total growth of savings accounts at all depositary-type
institutions dropped to less than 25 per cent in the first 10 months this
year, compared with shares of more than 35 per cent in 1963 and 1964, and
more than 50 per cent in 1960.

U.S. Government securities market. Yields in the U.S. Govern-

as the System made prompt and sizable purchases of bills. The initial
yield increases in all maturities were somewhat greater than a year ago,
and also greater than in July 1963, when the discount rate was raised
by 1/2 per cent.

Yields on Treasury notes and bonds began to rise in late November
following a mild decline in the previous two weeks. The yield advance was
initially triggered by news of an enlarged Federal budget deficit and a
growing conviction that interest rates would sooner or later have to rise.
In this market environment, dealer offerings expanded, but investment
selling remained light, apart from tax swapping transactions by banks;
indeed, net institutional buying developed on a sliding scale of prices.
This buying contributed to a reduction in dealer inventories in all
maturities, including a decline in holdings of bonds due in over 5 years
from $119 million on November 26 to $59 million on December 6. The
official accounts have not been active in the market for Treasury notes
and bonds since early November, when the Treasury purchased a sizable
amount of "when issued" 18-month notes from dealers.

III -13
Treasury bill rates had been edging upward since the second week
of November and they adjusted several basis points higher following the
increase in the discount rate. The key 3-month bill was auctioned at an
average rate of 4.344 per cent on December 6, up from an average of 4.115
per cent the week before. Net demand for bills from private investors
has been relatively light in recent weeks, apart from demand for short
maturities, but dealers sold over $1-1/4 billion of bills to the System
between November 24 and December 6, thereby helping to reduce their
heavy inventories.
The Treasury is expected to announce within a couple of weeks
a cash financing to cover at least the first installment of the sizable
cash drains anticipated in January. Some earlier projections by market
observers had indicated that the Treasury might need to borrow around
$2 billion in January, but the budget estimates recently released suggest
that the Treasury's needs may be higher than anticipated earlier.
Budget Outlook. Tentative Administrative Budget totals of
$105 billion of expenditures and $96.5 billion of receipts in fiscal
1966 were released in late November. Using this expenditure figure as
a benchmark and assuming receipts will turn out to be higher than this,
cash expenditures would total $132.8 billion and cash receipts $127.6
billion, resulting in a deficit of $5.2 billion.

Receipts 98.5 127.6 126.0
Expenditures 105.0 132.8 130.2
Surplus/deficit -6.5 -5.2 -4.2
The increased rates of spending implicit in the $105 billion
administrative budget figure suggest higher estimates of total cash out-
lays than shown in previous projections. These tentative budget totals
indicate a sharp acceleration in Federal spending in the spring of 1966
since actual spending during the first five months of this fiscal year
has been consistent with a lower fiscal year total. The new projections,
shown quarterly in the following table indicate a smaller cash surplus
in the first half of calendar 1966, and therefore, a reduction in the
amount of net debt repayment below earlier expectations.
On a national income basis, these budget totals imply that
Federal spending will reach a level of $135 billion (seasonally adjusted
annual rate) by the second quarter of 1966. To reach this level would
require an increase of $7.5 billion in Federal expenditures between the
fourth quarter of 1965 and the second quarter of 1966. If the $105
billion Administrative total is achieved, the rapid rise in expenditures
would more than offset the increase in social security taxes which is
scheduled to become effective January 1 and which will add $5.3 billion

III -15
at annual rates to receipts during the first half of calendar 1966.1
On a full-employment basis, the projected increase in expend-
itures would turn the small surplus in the second half of the calendar
year 1965 into a deficit for the first half of 1966. Earlier projections
had indicated that the surplus would increase in the spring because of
the social security tax increase. For fiscal year 1966 as a whole, the
figures now imply a full-employment budget in balance as compared to a
$5.7 billion surplus in fiscal 1965.
1/ On January 1, the social security tax rate, including health insurance,
will be raised from 7,25 per cent of taxable wages and salaries to 8.4
per cent and the maximum income subject to tax per employee will be
raised from $4,800 per year to $6,600 per year. The higher ceiling
extends the collection of social security taxes further into the
calendar year because it takes longer to reach the ceiling, after
which the tax is no longer paid. In addition to the increased tax
rate and wage ceiling, $600 million (at annual rates) of revenue is
scheduled to take effect at mid-year, when payments for the voluntary
health insurance program begin.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
U.S. Balance of Payments. Preliminary weekly balance of
payments indicators show a surplus for November and early December,
suggesting that the U.S. payments deficit in the fourth quarter, on
either the liquidity basis or the old regular transactions basis, may
well be no larger than the $300 million figure for the month of October.
This would make the deficit on regular transactions approximately $1-1/2
billion for the year; the modest improvement in this measure of the defi-
cit, compared to estimates of a month ago, may in part reflect post-
ponement of Canadian new issues. The estimates assume that the United
Kingdom will defer its year-end debt payments.
On the official settlements basis, the deficit in November
apparently continued at approximately the October rate of $100 million
a month, not adjusted for seasonal variation. The deficit on official
settlements is still estimated at less than $0.5 billion for the year,
Revised data on import arrivals indicate that the trade surplus
since midyear has been approximately $5-1/2 billion at a seasonally
adjusted annual rate. The very high import figure published for October
apparently included a sizable amount of shipments that actually arrived
in the third quarter, and the average level of imports in the four
months July-October ($22 billion annual rate, seasonally adjusted) is
probably the best available indication of the recent rate of purchases
from abroad.

This July-October rate was little changed from the second
quarter, which had been swollen by the catching up following the port
strike. Imports in these four months still included heavy arrivals of
steel, which were more than 60 per cent above year-ago levels. Apart
from steel, data in the table reveal few instances in which July-October
rates for other categories of imports appear obviously out of line with
recent trends. Imports of capital equipment were up 40 per cent from- --

the rate in the third quarter of 1964, imports of consumer goods were up
20 per cent, and imports of foods and beverages (apart from coffee) were
up 12 per cent. In each case the increase represented a continuation of
the year-to-year gain already recorded for the second quarter.
Exports have continued strong through October; in that month
they were a little under a $28 billion annual rate (balance of payments
basis), and for the four months July-October they averaged $27-1/2
billion at an annual rate, up 7 per cent from a year earlier. The higher
level of exports since midyear has in large part reflected a pick-up in
agricultural exports (see Green Book for Nov. 17). But there has been
a continued rise in new export orders for durable goods, and in the
third quarter these were about 15 per cent above a year earlier. The
increase in orders for jet aircraft was most pronounced, but orders
for machinery continued at a level about 10 per cent above a year
earlier, and orders for other durables also rose.

Financial markets abroad. During the three months up to
December 6 no major changes were made in monetary and credit policies
of major foreign countries. On December 6 the Bank of Canada's dis-
count rate was raised by 1/2 percentage point in line with the Federal
Reserve discount rate increase.
The economic background of the financial market developments
summarized in the following pages has included: a continuing improve-
ment in Britain's reserve position, but with persistent strains in the
domestic labor market; strong demand and very tight labor markets in
Germany and some other European countries, and also in Canada; further
recovery of economic activity in Italy, a definite upturn in France
this autumn after a year and a half of little change in the level of
activity, and a further stretch-out of the year-long pause in Japanese
economic expansion.
In Britain, no fresh steps to tighten credit have been taken
since the July change in installment credit regulations. Bank credit
expansion has slowed markedly. The rise in bank advances (seasonally
adjusted) from March to November at an annual rate of 3 per cent was
well within the 5 per cent annual growth ceiling, and it compares with
an increase in the year-earlier period of 17 per cent (at an annual rate).
Installment credit levelled off over the summer.
The impact of credit controls on total spending has been
mitigated by a surge in new corporate security issues, which in July-
October were over 50 per cent greater than in the previous four months.
Also, the earlier decline in new loans by the building societies has
begun to be reversed, as their intake of deposits has picked up.

Reflows of funds to London caused interest rates to ease
in September. Since then most changes have been moderate. The yield
on War Loan of 6.49 per cent on December 2 was still sharply below
its August high, though up 16 basis points from the end of September.
To maintain confidence in sterling and encourage inflows of
private funds, the Bank of England has resisted any tendency for short-
term market rates to decline in expectation of a Bank rate cut. The
Treasury bill rate, at 5.24 per cent on December 3, was only 3 basis
points lower than on October 1.
In France, the money market unexpectedly became very tight
in November, when the Treasury substantially reduced its outstanding
borrowings at the Bank of France. Call money rates averaged 4.6 per
cent in November, up sharply from the range of 3.8 to 4 per cent during
the preceding three months. To what extent the improvement in the
Treasury's cash position may be lasting is not yet known.
Continuing tightness in the money market would presumably lead
to offsetting action by the monetary authorities, to foster the current
revival of economic activity in France. Earlier, in mid-September, the
banks' liquid assets reserve requirement was reduced (from 36 to 34 per
cent). This move kept the market relatively easy in October despite
the lack in that month of net official acquisitions of foreign exchange
and gold. In the bond market, yields have risen considerably since
the end of August--by 20 basis points in the cae of public sector
bonds--as the result of a heavy volume of new issues, including a
1 billion franc Treasury issue in October for relending to industry.

IV -6
Italian banks have continued to add rapidly to bond port-
folios; their purchases were a factor in a decline of bond yields by
about 10 basis points from August to October (monthly averages), the
first sizable yield decline since the first quarter. To intensify
downward pressures on domestic interest rates, in November the Bank
of Italy stopped giving the larger banks dollar-lira swaps to increase
their foreign exchange assets. In the first ten months of 1965 the
banks had improved their net position vis-a-vis nonresidents by more
than $900 million, achieving a net creditor position for the first time
in October.
Conditions in German financial markets tightened slightly
further in September-October. Reduction of the banks' rediscount
facilities with the Bundesbank by 12-1/2 per cent took effect October 1.
In November, continuing inflows of short-term funds from abroad eased
pressures in the money market somewhat, but bond yields have stayed
very high despite the curtailment being made in the volume of new
issues by public authorities. The average yield on public authority
bonds on November 30 was 7.74 per cent, up from 7.60 per cent at the
end of August.
In Switzerland, the central bank acted to limit the rise in
Swiss bond yields by cutting back the allowed volume of new domestic
issues. The October-December quota of $137 million equivalent compares
with applications reportedly totalling in excess of $200 million, and
with $157 million of actual flotations in the fourth quarter of last
year. Despite the trimming of new domestic issues (and continued stiff
rationing of foreign access to the Swiss capital market), long-term

IV -7
bond yields have moved up slightly further. In the money market,
seasonal influences were mainly responsible for a rise in the 3-month
deposit rate from 3.7 per cent in late August to the present 4 per cent.
Rising demand for credit in Canada has caused further interest
rate increases in recent months, in particular a rise in the rate on
3-month finance company paper from 4.81 per cent on September 3 to
5.62 per cent on December 3. This jump (concentrated in late October
and early November) is ascribed largely to heavy consumer demand for
credit, especially in reflection of booming auto sales. In addition,
a spate of unfavorable publicity concerning operations of some Canadian
finance companies had adverse repercussions on the demand for finance
company paper.
From the end of August to December 2, the tender rate on
Canadian Treasury bills edged up 8 basis points, and long-term bond
yields moved up irregularly by around 10 basis points. On December 6,
the Bank of Canada raised its discount rate from 4-1/2 per cent to
4-3/4 per cent, and the market rate on Treasury bills increased by
1/8 percentage point.
In Japen, credit market conditions have become unusually easy.
During October and November the rate on call loans repayable at a day's
notice stood at 5.8 per cent, the lowest level in a decade and far
below the high of 11.3 per cent in September 1964. By September of
this year the average rate on commercial bank loans and discounts had
fallen to 7.68 per cent, from 7.99 at the end of 1964. With money
market conditions easy, stock market speculation has been readily

IV -8
financed. Despite a series of recent increases in margin requirements
to the highest level in three years, recovery in stock prices from last
July's low has continued.
The Japanese Government is contemplating domestic bond issues
early next year to finance a planned budget deficit, the first in 15
years. Its outstanding bonds currently yield 6.4 per cent, but reportedly
the new bonds will carry more realistic yields of 6.7 to 7.1 per cent.
