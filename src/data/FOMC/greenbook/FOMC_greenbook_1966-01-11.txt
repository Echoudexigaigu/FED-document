SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK
Outlook for GNP
GNP figures for the first three quarters of 1965 are being
revised substantially upward by the Commerce Department, because of
new information, particularly on plant and equipment outlays, inventory
accumulation and State and local government spending. The fact that a
revision will be announced shortly, as well as the revised numbers, must
be kept strictly confidential. The revisions will be made public about
mid-January.
Most analysts in recent weeks have been raising their pro-
jections of GNP for 1966, and this latest revision in the GNP base
will probably result in even more optimistic forecasts for this year.
Major uncertainty in any forecast continues to be the size of defense
outlays and the course of hostilities in Vietnam and their impact on
demands, resource availability, and expectations.
For the third quarter, revised GNP is now estimated at a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of $681.5 billion, $4 billion higher
than reported earlier. In line with currently available information on
expenditure trends since the third quarter, we are now estimating GNP
at $695 billion in the fourth quarter--up $13.5 billion from the third.
This would bring GNP for the year 1965 to $676 billion, $47
billion, or 7-1/2 per cent, above 1964. In real terms, the increase
amounts to 5-1/2 per cent--somewhat above the 5 per cent increase in 1964,
which was also the average for the years 1961-64.

I-2
Such an increase for the year 1965 was well above the upper
range of projections by the Council of Economic Advisers made early
in the year. Moreover, the magnitude of improvement in resource
utilization -- particularly for labor -- also considerably exceeded
expectations. By the end of the year, after the particularly large
fourth quarter rise in GNP, the margin of unutilized resources was the
narrowest in more than 8 years.
Even with the possibility that higher social security taxes
will moderate the gains in consumer spending this quarter, rising
business capital outlays and Federal purchases, particularly for defense
should result in an increase of about $12 billion for total GNP, to
a level of $707 billion.
Outlook for prices and resource utilization
With prospects favoring a continuation of large advances in
aggregate demands this year, upward pressures on prices appear likely
to be strong. So far, price increases have continued to be selective
and moderate, but the rise has persisted and the wholesale price index
for industrial commodities has risen about 2 per cent since the summer
of 1964. The announced increase in structural steel prices seemed
to threaten a broader increase in steel mill products and thus in
costs to producers of metal products, but an increase smaller than that
originally posted has been approved under the Administration's guideposts
and it now appears that steel prices will remain relatively stable for
some time. Unit labor costs are expected to rise somewhat this month
as a result of the increase in employer contributions for social security
tax.

I -3
Resources available for production are expected to expand
considerably further in 1966, assuming that demands continue to rise
at a rate close to that achieved in 1965. The fourth-quarter rate
of capacity utilization in manufacturing (seasonally adjusted) is es-
timated at 90 per cent, the same as in each of the other quarters of
1965. The utilization rate climbed gradually from 1961 to 1965, and has
now reached the highest level since 1956. The current utilization
rate is not a record, however; it was exceeded during 1955 and during
most of the Korean period.-
It is expected that the capital spending boom will bring an
extraordinarily rapid rate of increase in a manufacturing capacity in
1966 -- higher even than the estimated 6 per cent increase in 1965 and
far above the postwar average of 4.3 per cent per year. Nevertheless,
if the higher GNP forecasts being cited are realized, the pressure on
these expanded plant and equipment resources could be as large or larger
than in 1965.
Elasticity of the labor force in response to prospective
increased demands for labor -- together with the tendency of expansion
in the armed forces to bring additional youth into both the civilian
and the military labor forces -- should provide sufficient manpower
resources to permit a substantial increase in employment and real output
this year.
1/ There are various estimates of capacity utilization. They differ
as to level and occasionally as to movement, but they agree fairly well
with the generalization above. See Appendix A.

1 -4
According to staff studies, growth in real output this year
at close to the 1965 rate would require an increase in civilian employ-
ment of about 2 million, assuming a further rise in productivity at
close to the 1965 rate. The armed forces are assumed to increase by
about 300,000. The total labor force is expected to increase by only
2 million, however, and the unemployment rate would decline to an average
for the year below 4 per cent, from 4.5 per cent in 1965. At this level
of overall unemployment, labor bottlenecks are more likely to arise,
employing the need to continue to up-grade skills through in-plant
training and to expand vocational and other educational programs to
meet specialized skill requirements.
Bank credit
Total bank credit in January appears likely to continue to
expand at the strong fourth quarter rate -- 11 per cent -- or possibly
more if seasonal loan repayments are considerably less than usual and
if banks participate actively in Treasury financings. With investment
expenditures rising and corporate liquidity pressed, it is likely that
external financing of businesses will be large, both in the capital
markets and at banks. Business loans at banks may expand in the early
months of 1966 at about or somewhat faster than the 11 per cent annual
rate of October-November, but less than the very high December rate,
when tax and divident pressures, occurring in the context of reduced
corporate liquidity, swelled loan expansion. Other loans seem likely
to continue expanding at about the fourth quarter rate.

I-5
With loan demand strong, it is likely that banks will not
increase the moderate rate of municipal security acquisitions that
has been in evidence since September. Bank participation in the
Government securities market will be importantly determined by the nature
of the imminent new Treasury financing, as well as by the speed with
which banks liquidate the recently acquired tax bills.
Banks may become more aggressive in their search for time
money in order to accommodate continuing strong loan demand. Banks
in New York have so far exercised their flexibility under the new
Regulation Q ceiling by issuing mainly short-term CD's. But it is
likely that all banks in a buoyant economy may become more active in
offering competitive rates on longer-term CD's and also various forms
of other time deposits. This would tend to increase diversion of funds
from other financial intermediaries and market instruments to banks,
but in the process may generate upward interest rate pressures on
substitutable assets.
Securities market outlook
Treasury note and bond yields have continued to edge higher
in recent weeks, although these yield advances have been interspersed
by short-lived market rallies. Upward rate pressures have been con-
centrated in the short-intermediate end of the market. In the coming
weeks, current levels of note and bond yields generally will come under
further testing, from increased corporate capital flotations and also
from any continuing pressures in the short-term area generated in part
by Treasury cash financings. Sources of strength for the longer-term

I-6
end of the U.S. government market are the constraint of the interest
rate ceiling on new Treasury bond issues, and the relatively strong
technical position of dealers, who are currently carrying a net short
position in bonds due in more than 5 years.
In the corporate bond market, downward yield pressures
that have developed on recently offered issues since mid-December
have reflected a combination of seasonal slack in new issue volume and
a scarcity of underwriters' inventories. However, with an unusually
large corporate calendar scheduled for January, consisting largely of
utility and telephone company bonds, these yield declines seem likely
to prove short-lived.
In the municipal bond market, end-of-year yield declines
were less pronounced than those on recently offered corporate issues.
But with new offerings also seasonally low in late December, dealers
have substantially reduced their inventories. The January supply of new
municipal offerings, however, is expected to be sizable, and the
possibilities for any sustained seasonal easing of municipal bond yields
appear to be minimal.
Balance of payments
Recent data, still incomplete, have not changed earlier
impressions of the balance of payments position in the fourth quarter.
The seasonally adjusted deficit on the "liquidity" basis was probably
about $1/4 billion in the fourth quarter and about $1-1/4 billion in
1965 as a whole, or less than half as big as in 1964. On the "official
settlements" basis there was a sharp deterioration between the third

I-7
and fourth quarters, as the temporarily favorable effects of the summer
sterling crisis were reversed and as swap operations between the Bank
of Italy and Italian commercial banks were curtailed. Nevertheless,
for the year 1965 the "official settlements" deficit will undoubtedly
prove to have been substantially diminished from 1964's $1.2 billion.
Though U.S. imports have continued buoyant, the trade surplus in October-
November seems to have been at an annual rate over $1/2 billion larger
than for the year 1965 as a whole. (There is still some uncertainty
as to the proper adjustments to make for timing errors in the import
statistics.) Prospects for bringing the "liquidity" deficit down toward
zero in 1966 depend heavily on improvement over the October-November
rate of trade surplus, presently computed at about $5-1/2 billion.
Changes from recent levels in other current transactions and also in
capital movements (other than settlement items) may roughly cancel out.
Export expansion may continue to be fairly rapid as renewed
growth of demand in Japan, Italy, and France offsets slowdowns in some
other areas. But import expansion slowed only moderately through
November despite the ending of the steel-strike threat; in October-
November, imports appear to have equalled about 3.3 per cent of GNP --
higher than at any time except briefly in 1959. If GNP rises as pro-
jected, rapid growth of imports may continue, especially if inventory
investment continues large. Thus, while most analysts expect some
increase in the trade surplus, the improvement may be small.

I -8
The net outflow of U.S. private capital should be expected
to increase somewhat in 1966 from recent levels. The new Commerce
Department program should reduce direct investment outflows as compared
with the full year 1965, but not below the rate of the second half
year. Since the voluntary program for banks has been a constraint
on outflows of bank credit during 1965, and since U.S. exports are
expected to be rising, renewed outflows of bank credit should be
anticipated under the higher ceilings set for 1966.
On the other hand, shifts by the British Treasury from non-
liquid to liquid U.S. assets in the third quarter of 1965, and the
U.K. waiver of debt service payments in the fourth quarter, were adverse
developments -- only partly offset by Italian purchases of "nonliquid"
Roosa bonds -- that are not expected to be repeated in 1966.

THE ECONOMIC PICTURE IN RETAIL
The Nonfinancial Scene
Gross national product. The Department of Commerce has re-
vised upward its earlier estimates of gross national product and related
incomes for the first three quarters of 1965 to incorporate revisions
in underlying data. The fact that a revision is pending, as well as the
revised figures, must be held STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL until released by
Commerce (tentatively scheduled for around mid-January). Any pre-
mature use of the figures outside the System would be highly
embarrassing to the Board's staff.
The new figures are shown in the following table, with our
estimates for the fourth quarter of 1965 and our projections for the
first quarter of this year. The revision was due in large part to the
findings of the November Commerce-SEC survey of business plant and
equipment expenditures and to a major upward revision (also tenta-
tively scheduled to be released about mid-January) of the estimates of
industrial, commercial, and other nonresidential construction -- a
category only partly covered by the survey of plant and equipment
expenditures. Business inventory investment has also been boosted
substantially for the third and fourth quarters, reflecting higher
accumulation of nonfarm inventories as well as large accumulation of
farm inventories. In addition, State and local government expendi-
tures have been rising more rapidly than reported earlier. The pattern
of change in net exports has been altered to show: a much larger rise

II -2
in the second quarter, a decline -- instead of a rise -- in the
third quarter, and an increase subsequently. The level of consumption
expenditures has been changed very little.
GNP is now estimated at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
$681.5 billion in the third quarter, $4 billion higher than reported
earlier. The revised estimates now show an increase of $16.5 billion
in the first quarter of 1965 (instead of $15.3 billion), $11.2 billion
in the second quarter (in lieu of $9.5 billion), and $12.7 billion in
the third quarter (replacing the earlier figure of $11.6 billion).
On the basis of currently available information on expenditure
trends subsequent to the third quarter, we now estimate GNP at $695
billion in the fourth quarter -- up $13.5 billion from the third --
and we project a total of $707 billion for the current quarter. The
moderately slower rate of increase projected for the current,quarter
stems in part from an estimated smaller rise in total consumption expendi-
tures. This reflects in part the effects of the increase in personal
contributions for social insurance. Further expansion in business fixed
investment (in line with the findings of the latest Commerce-SEC survey)
and in Federal purchases -- particularly for defense -- are expected to
play a major role in the early 1966 GNP rise. There is still considerable
uncertainty about prospective Federal purchases during the first half of
1966 and our present estimate may prove to be too low.

Industrial production. In December industrial production is
tentatively estimated to have increased about one point further from the
preliminary November level of 145.5 per cent. Gains in output are expected
in both final products and materials.
Reflecting strong consumer demands, auto assemblies continued
at about a 9.3 million annual rate and first quarter output schedules
are set at the same level. In early December, television production
increased further. Output of business equipment is estimated to have
increased as truck production was at record levels and unfilled orders
for machinery and aircraft rose further in November. Also, output of
defense equipment presumably continued to increase.
Steel ingot production rose in December and, seasonally adjusted,
was 9 per cent above a month earlier. Other weekly data for materials--
paperboard, crude oil, petroleum refining, and coal--all indicate high and
rising levels of output.
The expected rise in December would bring industrial production
for 1965 to an index of about 143, 8 per cent above 1964. Increases in
output were widespread in both final products and materials, as shown
in the following table. The table also includes indexes for 1963 and
increases from 1963 to 1964 which were substantial, but not as large as
in 1965.

The large increase shown for auto assemblies in 1965 reflects
in part the strikes in late 1964. While at record rates in 1965, auto
assemblies, at 9.3 million, showed little change in level during the year.
Output of home goods reached a peak in March, drifted slowly downward through
August, and then rose sharply to new highs by the end of the year. Output
of business and defense equipment rose vigorously through the year with
some further acceleration at year's end.
Iron and steel rose to a new high prior to settlement of the wage
contract and then dropped sharply. In December, however, steel ingot
production turned up.

II -6
Automobile sales and stocks. Sales of new domestic cars declined
a little more than seasonally in the first 20 days of December and deliveries
for the month as a whole were probably at an annual rate somewhat below
the 9.0 million rate reported for November. During 1965 sales of domestic
cars were 8.8 million and imports 550,000. The total of over 9.3 million
cars sold represented a gain of 15 per cent from the 8.1 million sold
in 1964. An estimated 0.3 million deliveries in 1965 were "borrowed"
from the previous year because of auto strikes in late 1964.
In mid-December dealer inventories of new cars had risen to
their September level, after allowing for seasonal influences. Repre-
senting about 45 days' supply at current sales rates, they were not
considered excessive by industry standards.
Consumer credit. Consumers added $657 million to their instal-
ment debt in November. This increase, which amounted to $8.0 billion on
a seasonally adjusted annual rate basis, was well above that for
October and one of the largest monthly increases in 1965.
All types of instalment credit contributed to the November
rise. However, the sharpest increase came in auto credit, which moved
up in response to the rise in new car sales and the return to a more
normal pattern of credit purchases. Cash sales had been large in
October, as is usual early in a new model year.
Loans to purchase appliances and other household goods were
up a little at commercial banks but down at most other lenders. Con-
sumer buying at furniture and appliance stores apparently slackened in

II -7
November despite continued strong demand for such items as colored
television and stereo sets.
Demand for personal loans was stronger in November than in
October but still less than in most other months of 1965. The increase
in these loans in November amounted to $2.0 billion annual rate, com-
pared with $1.3 billion in October and a record $3.0 billion at tax
time last April.
Housing starts. Seasonally adjusted private housing starts
turned up sharply in November from the 2-3/4 year low reached in October,
and building permits were higher for the second consecutive month.

1/ Seasonally adjusted annual rate; preliminary.
Assuming housing starts in December continued near their ad-
vanced November rate -- not an unlikely possibility -- the total for
1965 would approach 1,490,000 private dwellings, including farm starts.

II -8
This would be about 4 per cent less than the 1964 total and 7 per cent
below 1963, the recent yearly high.
Based on the same assumption for December, housing starts in
the fourth quarter would somewhat exceed the third-quarter low, but
would be an eighth under the recent quarterly peak reached in early 1964.
This development is in line with most trade forecasts and other analyses
which imply a level of housing starts in 1966 somewhat above the third-
quarter 1965 low. However, uncertainty about the extent of the increase
has developed recently as a result-of increased interest rates and re-
lated developments in home-mortgage and institutional savings markets.
Although housing starts in 1965 were down for the second
consecutive year, additions of newly-completed dwellings to the existing
housing stock were probably only slightly below the recent high in 1964.
It is likely that completions of apartment units in 1965 were the second
most numerous on record. Indications through early fall were that the
additional completions were generally being absorbed without great
difficulty.
Orders for durable goods. New orders for durable goods in
November held at the record October level as a large drop in defense
orders was offset by sizable gains for most other goods. Orders for
defense products had been at sharply advanced levels in September and
October and a temporary decline was to be expected. Machinery and
equipment orders continued to expand in November and for steel, fabri-
cated metals, and miscellaneous durables orders showed large gains.

II -9
New orders for steel were back close to the level of shipments, and the
order backlog, which had declined by almost one-half from February to
October, showed only a small further decrease.
For durable goods as a group, including steel, the backlog
of unfilled orders increased considerably further in November although
at not quite so rapid a pace as in September and October when defense
orders were in especially large volume.
The build-up in the unfilled order backlog this year has
moderately exceeded the rise in shipments and the ratio of unfilled
orders to shipments was 2.84 in November as compared with the 2.60
level that prevailed during most of the period from early 1962 to July
1964. From that time to February 1965, when the steel order backlog
was rising sharply, this ratio rose from 2.58 to 2.70. Since February,
despite the fall-off in the steel order backlog, the ratio has moved
up further.
As shown in the table, ratios have increased appreciably
since mid-1964 for fabricated metal products, machinery and equipment,
and defense products but have shown little change for primary metals
and "other" durable goods. To provide some comparative background
figure also are shown for the 1955-56 period when the overall ratio of
unfilled order to shipments of durable goods was also rising -- waiving
the period around the 1956 steel strike when the ratio was exceptionally
high. In general, most of the ratios have shown much less rise this time
than in the 1955-56 period. Moreover, the levels of the 1964-65 ratios

II -10
are well below those in 1955-56, suggesting a generally better balance
of supplies and demands this time.

Business inventories. Total business inventory accumulation
apparently showed much less decline in late 1965 than had been estimated
earlier. Book value of manufacturers' inventories increased $435
million in November despite continued rapid liquidation of steel stocks.
For October and November combined the rise in inventories totaled more
than $800 million -- double the amount anticipated by manufacturers for
the whole fourth quarter, according to the Commerce November antici-
pations survey. In December, in view of the rise in steel output,
liquidation of steel inventories appears to have slowed, and another
sizable increase in manufacturers' inventories is to be expected.
Most of the November rise in factory stocks -- and all the
excess over earlier anticipations -- was in durable goods industries.
In that sector the November book value increase was $285 million and the
October-November rise totaled over $500 million, whereas in the November

II -11
anticipations survey a net decline of $100 million had been expected
for the fourth quarter as a whole. Most of the recent rise in durable
goods stocks was in machinery and equipment and defense products in-
dustries where unfilled orders have been increasing at a sizable pace.
Stocks of durable materials were about unchanged in October and
November, despite the large decline in steel stocks held by consuming
manufacturers.
The book value of nondurable goods inventories increased about
$150 million in November -and also in October -- and this rise was
in line with producers' anticipations for the fourth quarter as a whole.
Employment and labor force. Demands for labor were unusually
strong at year end, with employment rising well above
previous months. For the fourth quarter as a whole, total employment
increased by 2.2 million from a year earlier, the largest-year-to-year
rise of the year. The most important source of workers for expanding
jobs has been the sharply growing labor force but workers also have been
drawn from the ranks of the unemployed. Military demands for manpower
have also been a factor in the decline in unemployment.

Note: Estimates for December used in 4th quarter averages.
1/ The total labor force increase was 1.8 million reflecting the
close to 100,000 rise in the armed forces from a year earlier.
* Change less than 25,000.
Over the past year, 1.8 million persons have been added to
the total labor force, including a 100,000 increase in the armed forces.
This is substantially above the official projection of 1.35 million for
the period and also much higher than the previous years' increase of
1.1 million. The acceleration in labor force growth became apparent
at the close of the school year last spring when a considerably larger
than anticipated number of youths sought and found jobs. The upsurge
in youth employment turned out to be more than a temporary seasonal

II -13
phenomenon and the number of youths in the labor force continued to
rise sharply during the remainder of 1965 in response to strong employ-
ment demands. Also after midyear there was a sharp step-up in the pace
at which women were entering the labor force and their participation
rates began to rise rapidly.
Especially significant has been the fact that the faster
increase in labor force occurred as the available supply of adult
men was tightening considerably. Not only has growth in the labor force
of men in the central age groups been small -- because of low birth
rates in the 1930's -- but the unemployment rate for adult men had
declined sharply by midyear to 3.1 per cent and was further reduced to
2.7 per cent in the fourth quarter. Another factor reducing the number
of men seeking work has been a relatively sharp increase in early retire-
ments. There has been a particularly noticeable decline in recent
months in participation rates of men 55-64 years of age so that the
number of men in this age group is now below official projections --
in the fourth quarter, the shortfall was almost 200,000.
With employment gains exceeding even the very large growth
in the labor force, unemployment has continued to decline steadily in
recent months. Most of the reductions in unemployment have been
among adult men reflecting continued requirements for experienced and
skilled workers. Almost four-fifths of the half million decline in
unemployment over the past year was among men, reducing their
unemployment rate to the lowest level since the Korean War. Despite the

II -14
large increase in employment among youth, the number of teenagers
unemployed has changed little. In part, this reflects high job turn-
over among youths and relatively short spells of unemployment. But
also evident is the persistent hard-core problem of inexperienced
younger workers with inadequate education whose job opportunities are
more limited even in periods of high levels of demand.
Earnings, productivity, and unit labor costs. Average hourly
earnings in manufacturing continued to increase moderately in November.
However, in nonmanufacturing industries, which are either largely
unorganized, or where bargaining is concentrated in small units often
widely dispersed geographically, wage increases have been higher than
in manufacturing. The 3.3 per cent rise in hourly earning in manu-
facturing for the first 11 months of 1965, was about in line with gains
reported in other recent years. But substantially larger increases,
over 5 per cent, have been reported in retail trade, electric and gas
utilities, and laundries, while increases of over 4 per cent have appeared
in construction, hotels, and banking.
Recent revisions upward in output data for the economy as
a whole have lifted output per manhour to higher rates of increase than
were previously indicated. Final data for the fourth quarter are not
yet available, but it now seems likely that the rise in output per man-
hour for the private economy will be about 3.0 per cent in 1965, somewhat
below the 3.4 per cent increase in 1964. Including the current estimate

II -15
for 1965 in the 5-year trend productivity calculation used by the Council
for its guidepost, trend productivity for the period will rise to 3.6
per cent compared to the previously used 3.2 rate. Of the .4 per cent
increase, half results from upward revisions in GNP and half from the
substitution of 1965 for 1960 in the 5-year average.
The trend in output per manhour in manufacturing has been
obscured in recent months by the decline in steel output and the
effect of the auto strike in October and November of last year. For
the year as a whole, however, the increase in output per manhour for
all employees is estimated to average about 3.7 per cent, somewhat be-
low the rise a year earlier, but about in line with the average gain
for the past 5 years.
The movement of labor costs per unit of output in manufacturing
also has been obscured by the steel and auto developments. Unit labor
costs apparently remained relatively stable in the final months of 1965
around an index of 100 (1957-59 = 100), compared with an average of
99.6 for 1964. An increase of about .7 is expected in the unit labor
cost index in January owing to an increase in employer contributions for
social security. Productivity gains in trades and services have not
appeared to have kept pace with rising wage rates and labor costs per
unit of output in those activities apparently have increased.
Wholesale prices. The industrial commodity price index from
mid-October to mid-November rose -- for the second consecutive month --
.2 per cent, and is estimated to have risen an additional .1 per cent to

II -16
late December. The estimated December index at 102.8 per cent of the
1957-59 average, was .7 per cent above the June level and 2.0 per cent
above the level in the summer of 1964, before the upward drift began.
Average prices of foodstuffs rose sharply from mid-October to late
November, and the total wholesale price index in late December was about
1 per cent above the June level.
Much of the rise in the industrial index from October to
November was attributable to further advances in metals and machinery.
Most of the remaining increase was associated with the continued re-
covery of petroleum products, a further increase in wastepaper and
hides and leather, and a rise in glass containers. The continuing price
rise in hides and leather is partly the result of reduced Argentinean
and Soviet supplies and a consequent shift of foreign demand to the
United States. Synthetic fiber textile products, electical machinery,
and gypsum products declined.
Two steel producers -- Bethlehem and Inland -- announced
increases of $5 per ton or around 4 per cent on structural shapes which
account for about 7 per cent of the steel market, and a third firm
announced and then postponed a smaller increase. Subsequently, U.S.
Steel announced an increase of $2.75 per ton for a number of structural
products which, U.S. Steel said, account for 4 per cent of total domestic
output. Simultaneously the corporation announced a reduction of $9
per ton or 6-1/2 per cent for steel sheet on the West Coast, and assessed
the combined effect of these changes as an increase of 0,1 per cent in

II -17
the average of all steel prices. The BLS price index for steel mill
products has been stable in recent months at a level about 0.5 per cent
higher than in the first four months of 1965. The Administration,
which had attempted to force recision of the increases announced by
Bethlehem and Inland by directing that all orders for structural steels
by the Federal Government, by Government contractors, or by State and
local governments in federally aided programs be placed with firms
that have not raised prices, has termed the U.S. Steel changes as within
the guideposts and acceptable.
Major foreign producers have raised the price of copper from
38 cents to 42 cents a pound. The price in the "free" market has been
averaging between 65 and 71 cents per pound while domestic producers
are maintaining the 36 cent price. Thus, the domestic price is now 14
per cent below the world producer price and around 45 per cent below
the "free" market price. Prices of some copper mill products have been
rising in domestic markets,
Hog prices continue to fluctuate near the record high levels
reached in early December largely as a result of reduced pig crops
induced by past low prices, and also because of current withholding of
breeding animals induced by present high prices. A Department of
Agriculture survey indicates that the pig crop planned for next spring
will be up 7 per cent from the 1965 spring crop. Cattle prices have
changed little since last summer. Egg prices are about a third higher
than a year ago partly because of reduced laying flocks, while fresh
fruits and vegetables are down substantially from a year ago.

Consumer prices. The consumer price index from mid-October
to mid-November rose .2 per cent to 110.6 per cent of the 1957-59
average, and was 1.7 per cent above a year earlier. Food prices,
usually stable or declining in the fall, were unchanged for the second
consecutive month. Increases in dairy products and restaurant meals
were offset by declines in meats and eggs; both meats and eggs, however,
rose substantially in wholesale markets in December. Nonfood commodities
advanced .3 per cent in November as new car prices rose seasonally
while further increases occurred in apparel. Household durables were
unchanged while used car prices declined about seasonally. Services
rose .3 per cent further, and, at 119.0 per cent of the 1957-59 average,
the service index was 2.6 per cent above a year earlier.Index

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL SITUATION
Bank credit. Business demands for bank loans over the December
tax and dividend dates were heavy. Mainly reflecting the strength of
business loans, total bank credit continued to rise at around the 11 per
cent annual rate of the two preceding months, when bank credit expansion
was swollen by Treasury financing and security loans. For the year 1965
as a whole, bank credit rose at about a 10 per cent rate, as compared to
8.4 per cent in 1964.
Preliminary estimates suggest that business loans at all com-
mercial banks rose $1.4 billion in December, slightly less than the record
$1.5 billion of January. The very large increase partly reflected strong
tax and dividend pressures at a time when corporate liquidity was pressed,
but the December increase in business loans seems too large to be ex-
plained by temporary year-end factors alone. It would appear, therefore,
that growth in business bank loans accelerated further from the moderate
pace that was seen immediately following the steel strike settlement this
summer.
Consumer and real estate loans at banks continued to increase
at about the same rate in December as in other recent months. Bank loans
to security dealers and finance companies, despite a larger than normal
rise around the tax and dividend dates, appear to have shown little change
for the month as a whole on a seasonally adjusted basis.
Commercial bank holdings of Treasury issues showed little change
last month, even though a large volume of newly issued Treasury bills

III -2
were acquired late in November. Loan demand encouraged banks to begin
liquidating the newly issued bills early in December, and weekly reporting
banks reported taking into position somewhat less than the normal amount
of bills during the tax and dividend dates. Bank acquisitions of municipal
and agency securities in December continued at the reduced rate of
October-November. For the fourth quarter, such holdings rose at an annual
rate slightly over 8 per cent or about half of the rate of the first 9
months of the year.
Deposits. From the end of November through the tax date,
weekly reporting banks lost $865 million of CD's, over twice as much as
in the same period last year. About one-half of this year's run-off
occurred in New York City, but by the end of the month these banks had
replaced almost two-thirds of their CD loss. Last year, New York CD's
outstanding after tax run-offs showed no rebound until year end. However,
banks outside of New York, in the first week after the tax date, replaced
only $32 million of their $426 million decline in CD's.
So far, most New York banks are offering 4.75 per cent across
the CD maturity spectrum, with one bank offering 4.80 for 90-day money.
This rate pattern suggests that New York banks have probably replaced
maturing CD's with relatively short maturities. Since maturities already
scheduled for this month are large, such an emphasis may give rise to a
particularly heavy CD run-off in January and early February.
Mainly as a result of heavy CD run-offs in December, growth in
time and savings deposits declined to an estimated 11.5 per cent annual

III -3
rate in December--considerably below the growth rate of October-November.
However, for the year as a whole, bank time and savings deposits grew
at a 16 per cent rate, the largest since the more than 18 per cent gain
of 1962.
The money stock in December rose at about a 12 per cent annual
rate, according to preliminary estimates, paralleling the large increase
in bank credit, while seasonally adjusted Treasury deposits showed little
change during the month. Growth in the money stock during all of 1965
is now estimated to be about 4.8 per cent, as compared to 4.3 per cent
in 1964. A much slower growth in the money stock would now not be
unlikely over the next two or three months, reflecting the impact of sharp
increases in yields on time deposits and other money substitutes on the
public's demand for cash. This is a pattern which has been characteristic
of periods immediately following previous changes in Regulation Q.
Corporate and municipal bond markets. With new issue volume
at a seasonally low level, yields on recently offered corporate and
municipal bonds turned down during the closing weeks of 1965. On
some corporate issues, this decline erased virtually all of the rise
that followed the early December discount rate action. Yields on
seasoned corporate bonds, however--which typically lag behind other bond
yield series--continued to rise, and yields on municipal issues, although
edging down somewhat, maintained most of their earlier advances.

In the corporate bond market, with dealer inventories of older
issues already at minimum levels, the quick sell-out of the $100 million
Consolidated Edison Bond in the week following the discount rate in-
crease, along with the indefinite postponement of another $75 million
offering previously planned for December, swept the immediate market
virtually bare of investment grade issues. In the face of this supply
vacuum, even the limited volume of year-end demand was sufficient to
depress yields on recently offered issues. Yields on seasoned issues
did not respond to this essentially short-run technical pressure, partly
because of their typical tendency to lag current market developments,
but also because the calendar of new offerings scheduled for January is
unusually heavy.

III -5
The January volume of publicly offered corporate bonds is
expected to total about $500 million for more than the January volume
a year ago and the largest turn of the year supply since 1958. Moreover,
although the volume of private placements typically turns down sharply
in January from a seasonal high reached in December, reports of heavy
continuing private placement activity suggest that take-downs on such
commitments will continue to place heavy demands on the available supply
of long-term funds in the months ahead.

In January 1966 scheduled preferred stock offerings amount to $100 million.
In the municipal bond market the seasonal slowing of offerings
in the latter half of December gave dealers an opportunity to reduce
inventories. At year end, their advertised holdings totaled only $460
million, down $150 million from late November and the lowest level

III -6
reached since March 1963. Although this inventory reduction was ac-
complished only after substantial price cutting to bring yields on older
issues into line with those on recent offerings, demand for municipals
at these higher yields appears to have been somewhat stronger than it
was in late November immediately prior to the Regulation Q action.
The improved technical position of municipal dealers places
them in a better position to bid for January offerings of new issues, at
a time when the supply of funds available for security investments some-
times shows a seasonal rise. However, the January calendar of municipal
offerings is expected to remain at least as large as it has been in
recent months.and, with Treasury and corporate demands for funds particu-
larly large, any seasonal rise in the supply of available investment
funds seems likely to meet a strong demand. Moreover, since municipal
dealers generally experienced an unprofitable year in 1965, they are
not likely to bid aggressively to rebuild positions in the hope of
profiting from any temporary seasonal turn in market yields.
Home mortgage markets. The general updrift of yields on home
mortgages--which began late last summer for FHA and VA underwritten
loans--has reportedly accelerated since the Federal Reserve actions
taken in early December. While firm data are not yet available to
measure the extent of further increases, some analysts estimate that
yields on sensitive FHA and VA home loans may have increased as much as
10 or more basis points in December. This would be a good deal more than
in the immediately preceding months.

III -7
In response to the further general upward pressure on mortgage
rates, the Federal National Mortgage Association cut prices paid by 1
per cent on most FHA and VA loans offered to them under its secondary
market operations, effective December 10. This step followed additional
increases in mortgage offerings to FNMA during November and early
December. Much of the buildup in offerings apparently came from mort-
gage companies seeking to dispose of warehoused loans, at a time when
the fixed FNMA prices were increasingly attractive relative to declining
prices on mortgages traded in the private secondary market.
Statistical evidence of the upward pressures already present
on mortgage rates before the Federal Reserve actions in early December
continues to accumulate. In November, average yields in the private
secondary market on certain FHA-insured new-home loans rose for the
third consecutive month, bringing the average yield to 5.51 per cent.
This was 6 basis points above the August level which had prevailed
for more than two years.
Contract interest rates for conventional first mortgages on
new homes as measured by the FHA also rose somewhat further in November
to levels 10 basis points above those prevailing in late summer. In
this series to the late summer rates had previously held about unchanged
for more than two years. Adjustments in nonrate terms, on the other hand,
apparently moved counter to contract rates during November for conventional
home loans covered by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board series.
Nonfarm foreclosures--mainly on homes--rose further in the
third quarter of last year, continuing an uptrend which has lasted

III -8
throughout the current business expansion. As in the second quarter,
however, the year-to-year increase was appreciably less than in the
corresponding period a year earlier. Moreover, the number of fore-
closures in relation to the increased number of outstanding loans
apparently changed little, if at all.

Stock market. Common stock prices, as measured by Standard
and Poor's composite 500 stock index, showed a small further net rise
in December and ended the year at a new all-time high of 92.43. Over the
full year the index rose 9 per cent--which compares with a 12 per cent
rise in 1964. Trading volume during the year averaged 6.2 million
shares a day, up sharply from the 4.9 million daily average posted in
1964 and the largest volume on record.

Standard and Poor's index. Then in the next month and a half they
dropped back 9-1/2 per cent. During the latter half of the year, prices
staged a strong recovery which carried the index up more than 13 per
cent. Because profits of the 500 companies included in the index rose
relatively more than the index itself, however, the price-earnings ratio
declined from 18.7 at the end of 1964 to 17.6 at the end of 1965, assuming
fourth quarter earnings at Standard and Poor's projected level.
Since late summer, stock trading has exhibited a more speculative
temper. And stock market credit--after trending downward from the spring
of 1964--has turned up, While some of this rise in credit use is attributable
to increased trading and an associated expansion of temporary credits re-
lated to clearings, the bulk of the rise apparently represents enlarged
margin trading. Total stock market credit rose $400 million from
August through November, about to the $7.3 billion high reached in
April 1964 at the time of the large AT&T "rights" offering. Three-quarters
of this rise occurred in customers net debit balances with brokers. But
the November total of such balances--at $5.2 billion--was still nearly
$400 million below the level prevailing when margin requirements were
raised two years before.
U.S. Government securities market. Yields on U.S. Government
securities have risen further since their initial adjustment to the
discount rate increase in early December. The largest rate increases
in recent weeks have occurred in the shorter-term maturity area, where
the impact of prospective Treasury cash financings is expected to be
concentrated.

Yields on intermediate and long-term Treasury bonds have
moved higher in recent weeks despite a number of short-lived rallies.
While continuing to probe for a new trading level and buffeted to some
extent by professional activity, the Treasury bond market has retained
a hesitant undertone. Major influences on the market have been the
expectation of a large volume of capital market financing in the early
months of 1966 and prospects of possible inflationary developments in
the general economy. In this market environment, dealers have reduced
their holdings of bonds due in over-5-years to net short positions of
around $50 million in late December. Concomitantly, however, dealer
positions in notes and bonds due within 5 years rose around $150 million

III -11
in the second half of December, reflecting in part selling by investors
on switches into Treasury bills.
Treasury bill rates advanced sharply further from about mid-
December to early January despite sizable market demand for bills,
including year-end demand by banks and corporations for window-dressing
purposes. The upward pressure on bill rates appears to have been induced
mainly by aggressive dealer efforts to reduce their bill inventories in
light of high financing costs and the expectation of additions by the
Treasury to market supplies of short-term securities to meet cash needs
in early 1966. A measure of recent bill rate movements is given by
3- month bill auction results which have ranged from an average rate
of 4.115 per cent in late November to 4.391 per cent in mid-December
and 4.532 per cent in early January 1966 when a first $100 million
addition was made to the weekly 3-month bill auction.
Other short-term rates have also continued to move higher
since their initial adjustment to the discount rate increase in early
December. Rates on selected short-term securities are shown in the

Treasury finance. On December 22 the Treasury announced its
cash financing plans for early 1966 and indicated that it might need to
raise a total of around $5 billion during the first few months of the
new year. The financing package includes a $1 billion addition to the
June tax bill, already auctioned on December 29, a $100 million addition
to the weekly 3-month bill auction which will probably be continued
through a full 13-week cycle covering the first quarter of 1966, and a
$1.5 billion financing in short-term area during January. The Treasury
is expected to announce the details of the latter financing this week.

III -13
Some of the Treasury's remaining cash needs may possibly be raised in
conjunction with the regular February refunding which will involve
a relatively light $2.5 billion of maturing debt held by the public.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
U.S. Balance of Payments. Monthly figures for October and
November, together with preliminary weekly indicators for almost all of
December, suggest that the U.S. payments position for the fourth quarter
may show:
(1) a small deficit on the liquidity basis -- probably about
$1/4 billion
(2) a somewhat larger deficit on regular transactions
(3) a fairly sizable deficit on official settlements --
on the order of $1/2 billion or more
Compared with the results for the third quarter, and for the
first 9 months of 1965, these figures would represent an improvement
on the liquidity basis and on regular transactions (which differs from
the liquidity basis by inclusion of debt prepayments, advance receipts
on military exports and sales of non-convertible Roosa bonds among the
items that measure the deficit). On the other hand, the fourth
quarter will show a substantial deterioration on official settlements,
reflecting the ending and reversal of temporary developments in the
third quarter. In that quarter, movements out of sterling into the
Euro-dollar market and shifts of funds from the Bank of Italy to
Italian commercial banks were largely responsible for the ap-
pearance of a surplus on official settlements; in the fourth quarter,
the reflux into sterling and the drastic curtailment of swap operations
between the Bank of Italy and Italian banks in the face of a continuing
payments surplus have been major elements contributing to the sub-
stantial deficit on official settlements. Taking the third and fourth

IV -2
quarters together, the deficit on official settlements is not expected
to differ substantially from the results for the first half of the year.
The deficit for the year 1965 on regular transactions and on official
settlements is expected to be about half the 1964 figure -- that is,
about $1-1/2 billion regular transactions and perhaps as much as $3/4
billion on official settlements. The improvement, compared to 1964,
in the balance on the liquidity basis will probably be slightly greater
than on regular transactions, owing to a rise in special receipts in
1965.
In the fourth quarter of 1965, we know of $160 million of
such receipts, representing purchases by the Italian authorities of non-
convertible U.S. dollar notes, which will be redeemed as payment is
made for Italian-purchases of U.S. military equipment.
The postponement into 1966 of some new Canadian bond issues
helped the U.S. payments position in the fourth quarter, while the
postponement of year-end payments by British had an adverse effect of
approximately the same magnitude.
Net extensions of bank credits under the VFCR in November
only partly offset net reflows of such credits in October; the $110
million net reflow of bank credits in these two months together was
sufficient to outweigh outflows of other bank-reported claims on
foreigners.
Direct investment is the principal capital account item on
which there is no information available past the third quarter. In
that quarter there was a sharp reduction in the net outflow to $0.5

IV -3
billion from a rate of $1 billion per quarter (including some special
transactions) in the first half. Much of the third-quarter decline was
accounted for by reduced outflows to Europe.
U.S. merchandise exports have continued the strong advance
that became evident last summer. At an annual rate of $28.1 billion
(balance of payments basis) exports in October/November were more than
3 per cent above the third quarter rate. The October/November gain
reflected a rise in non-agricultural exports. Agricultural exports
continued close to the high third quarter rate, following recovery from
a slump in the first half of the year; sales of coarse grains and soy
beans to Europe have been high, reflecting poor European harvests.
Data on merchandise imports require substantial correction
for variations in the carryover of statistical documents from one
reporting period to the next. After tentative adjustment for this,
imports in October/November appear to have been at an annual rate of
$22-1/2 billion, up about 2 per cent from the third quarter and 16 per
cent from a year earlier. The trade surplus for the two months was
about $5-1/2 billion at an annual rate, up about $1/4 billion from the
third quarter.

Prices and wages in industrial countries. Over the past year
the domestic stabilization efforts in France and Italy, which began to
show results in 1964, have brought a further slowing of price and wage
advances. Rises in the Netherlands have continued fairly large, but not
as large as in 1963-64 when the Dutch wage-regulation system broke down.
Of the Common Market countries, only Germany has had larger rises in wage
rates and consumer prices this year than last, and even in Germany the
rise in wholesale prices of manufactures has slowed a little.
In Britain and Japan the pace of consumer price rises has shown
no moderation, and for Britain the same may be said of industrial prices.
Average changes of industrial prices in Japan have been small in both the
past two years. In Canada, as in the United States, price and wage advances
have been greater this year than last.

In each of the Common Market
wholesale price index for manufacturescountries, the advance shown in the
over the past year has been con-
siderably smaller than the country's consumer price increase. This behavior
may help to explain some relatively moderate increases in indexes of export
prices (or of unit values): only about 2 per cent in France and Germany,
and a 3 per cent decline in Italy. In Britain, too -- but in this case
despite a larger rise in the domestic prices of manufactures -- the export
unit value index has risen at a rate of only 2 per cent. In contrast, for
whatever the comparison may be worth, the not very reliable U.S. unit value
indexes for manufactures and semimanufactures show rises of nearly 4 per
cent from September 1964 to September 1965 (not yet published); these
increases occurred in late 1964 and early 1965, with a peak in February.

Italy. The effects of the stabilization program are apparent in a
further slowing of rise this year in most price indexes. In the twelve
months to September 1965, prices of non-food consumer goods rose only 1.7
per cent compared with 5.6 per cent a year earlier; at the wholesale level
the increase in prices of industrial goods was also smaller. However, con-
sumer food prices continued to climb rapidly.
Wage rates in Italy have recently shown a much lower rate of
increase than in the previous three years. In part, this slowing reflects
the small number of contracts which have come up for renegotiation in the
past year, but it also reflects (with a lag) the effects on labor demand
of the 1964 Italian recession.
France. Price increases have continued to be moderate compared
with prestabilization years. In the year to October, prices of non-food
consumer goods rose about as much as a year earlier, but the rise in consumer

IV -7
food prices slowed down. Wholesale prices rose only a little more than
1 per cent; wholesale prices of manufactures in fact declined fractionally.
Hourly wage rates (in all occupations except agriculture and
government service) rose about 6 per cent in the 12 month through September,
compared with about 7 per cent in the previous 12 months.
Germany. Persistently strong demand influences are largely
responsible for the more rapid pace of consumer price advances in the
twelve months to October. Tight labor market conditions have been reflected
in a continuing rapid rise in hourly earnings in industry. The rise in
wholesale prices of manufactures accelerated considerably in the last
several months of 1964, but since early 1965 has been somewhat slower,
particularly for investment goods.
United Kingdom. The pace of upward price and wage movements in
the United Kingdom seems hardly to have moderated. Retail prices rose
almost 5 per cent in the year ending in September, partly because of higher
drink and tobacco taxes imposed in April. The increase in average weekly
earnings in the 12 months to October exceeded gains in agreed weekly wage
rates by about 2 per cent. As the year ended, the British Trades Union
Congress voted to support the Government's income policy in agreeing to
consult in the drafting of legislation incorporating some compulsory
features of prices and wages review.
Canada. Under the influence of continued high levels of
economic activity and tight labor markets, there has been some acceleration
of upward price and wage movements. The 3.2 per cent increase in consumer
prices in the year ending in October reflected in part the effects of a
sharp rise in food prices, particularly beef and vegetables. Wholesale

IV -8
prices of manufactures, which were almost unchanged in the year through
October 1964, rose by 3.2 per cent in the following twelve months.
Japan. Differential movements within the Japanese price
structure in the past year have reflected differences in the strength
of demand for consumer goods and investment goods. Prices of non-food
consumer goods, both at retail and wholesale, have been rising, while
investment goods prices have been declining. The total consumer price
index rose especially sharply up to April 1965, as the result of a run-
up in food prices, which have since then held at below-peak levels.

rose about 1/8 per cent in the first half of December. There were also
advances of about 1/8 per cent in long-term bond yields in the United
Kingdom and in Germany. Bond prices declined in Bitain because the U.S.
action marked the end of hopes for an early cut in Bank rate. In Germany,
the uptrend in bond yields in this period mainly reflected continued sell-
ing generated by borrowing difficulties of the German public authorities.

APPENDIX A: MEASURES OF CAPACITY UTILIZATION*
At least three measures of industrial capacity utilization are in
widespread use as tools for analyzing the current economic situation. The
McGraw-Hill monthly measure for manufacturing is the most recent entry into
the field, having been announced in the December 25th edition of Business
Week. The Wharton School quarterly measure for manufacturing, mining, and
utilities is an older series but has recently been overhauled and revised.
And our own measure for manufacturing continues to be widely quoted in
spite of its "not for publication" tag. Our measure for "major materials"
is not so widely publicized but may have special relevance as an indicator
of inflationary pressures. Fortunately -- and in contrast to the situation
a few years ago -- these measures tell pretty much the same story; namely,
that utilization rates have been fairly stable this year at the highest
rates since the mid-fifties, but are still below the peak quarters of that
period.
A. The McGraw-Hill Measure -- The new McGraw-Hill measure
(see attached table) takes as its starting-point the answers to its
survey question addressed to a sample of manufacturing companies a
little over a year ago, "What per cent of your capacity were you operat-
ing in September 1964?" From the September starting-point output is moved
by per cent changes in the relevant components of our industrial production
index (seasonally adjusted); capacity is changed by per cent changes
implied by answers to an earlier McGraw-Hill survey question, "How much
do you plan to increase your capacity this year?"
Twice a year this battery of utilization rates is confronted
with the results of a new survey of operating rates; and for manufacturing
as a whole the discrepancies to date (December 1964 and September 1965)
have been very minor. For the components, the McGraw-Hill procedure has
been to average the extrapolation results and the survey results and then
proceed from the average rates as before.
Quarterly average utilization rates for all manufacturing
according to this measure are as follows:
1964 -IV 86
1965 -I 89
II 89
III 89-
IV 88-89
The measure could be carried back before September 1964 -- all the
ingredients, in fact, exist back to December 1954 -- but it has not
been done. The new monthly rates of operation are shown in Table 1.

and Statistics.

B. Our measure for manufacturing -- Our manufacturing measure
is based largely on McGraw-Hill and industrial production data and is
therefore quite similar to the McGraw-Hill measure. The basic trend of
capacity in our series is derived by dividing the manufacturing production
index by McGraw-Hill operating rates for all manufacturing. Year-to-year
movements in this capacity indicator are smoothed through the use of a
capital stock series and the McGraw-Hill survey results on yearly capacity
change. Our output series is the manufacturing component of the industrial
production index.
Recent quarterly results for our series, together with some
historical figures, are as follows. Complete results appear in Table 2.

The quarterly movements in our series parallel those of the
McGraw-Hill series. The difference in level arises because McGraw-Hill
assumes that its respondents provide seasonally adjusted operating rates
whereas we have assumed that they provide unadjusted rates. There is some
evidence that the McGraw-Hill assumption is superior, so we plan to shift
our measure to that basis next time it is revised.
C. The Wharton School measure -- The Wharton School measure
for manufacturing, mining, and utilities, formerly was calculated by
drawing straight lines between cyclical production peaks and calling these
lines "capacity". This procedure is still followed for many of the
component industries, but for about half of them a complex new procedure
involving factor shares and unemployment by industry is followed. Results
for recent and selected past quarters follow:

III 93 IV 94
1956 -I 93

IV 93
The Wharton School also has recently introduced a measure of
capacity utlization for "services" based on ton-miles for transportation,
residential housing vacancies, and office-rental vacancies. The new
measure shows much less fluctuation than the industrial measure, but it
is also currently at a level which has not been equaled or exceeded since
the 1955-57 expansion.
D. Major materils indexes -- Our capacity and output indexes
for seventeen industrial materials, based on surveys (trade association
or government) of rated capacity and physical output records, has been
crippled since the Iron and Steel Institute discontinued its capacity surveys
five years ago. But it is still possible to present results based on
"low" and "high" estimates of steel capacity. These results follow:

E. Other measures -- Bert Hickman of Brookings, the National
Industrial Conference Board, Fortune, Peter Tinsley of our staff, and
perhaps others have all experimented with aggregative utilization measures
in addition to the widely used ones described above.
The Office of Business Economics has had nearly two years'
experience now with a "capacity evaluation" question attached to its
plant and equipment survey. Each respondent is asked whether his plant
and equipment facilities are "adequate" to meet current and prospective
demands, whether more plant and equipment is needed, or whether existing
plant and equipment exceeds needs. Results of the survey (which may include
seasonal forces as well as cyclical pressures) for all manufacturing
follows:
SURVEY EVALUATION OF CAPACITY, OFFICE OF BUSINESS ECONOMICS

and equipment About equipment

1964 -March 31 36 58 6
June 30 38 56 6

Dec. 31 43 51 6
1965 -March 31 42 52 6
June 30 47 47 6
Sept. 30 49 45 6
These results seem to indicate more tightening of capacity
pressures during the year 1965 than do the aggregative measures des-
cribed earlier. The metal fabricating industries have been responsible
for a large share of the tightening, with their proportion under "more
plant and equipment needed" rising from 32 per cent in September 1964
to 61 per cent in September 1965. The McGraw-Hill detail also suggests
more tightening for these industries than for the total.
In spite of the lack of perfect agreement among various
measures, it is heartening that widely different approaches to
capacity measurement give broadly consistent descriptions of the

current situation. To many of u, it is surprising as well as heartening;
it seems to be possible to squeeze much more information out of unpromising
data than we would have believed.
