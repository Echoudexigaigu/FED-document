SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK
Outlook for GNP
The increase in GNP in the current quarter is expected by
the Board's staff to be at least as large, and possibly larger, than
the sharp rise reported for the fourth quarter of last year. Federal
spending continues to be a very expansive influence. The Budget Message
suggests a sharp rise is underway in total Federal spending; on a
national income basis, the rise in total spending is slated to amount
to over $9 billion, annual rate, from the fourth quarter 1965 to the
second quarter 1966. Less than half of the rise will be in defense
spending; transfer payments (a component of personal income) and grants-
in-aid are also slated to rise rapidly.
Continued rapid expansion in business fixed investment is
still indicated. Incentives to invest are strong, with utilization
of manufacturing capacity in December 1965 now estimated at over 91 per
cent of capacity. New orders for machinery and equipment continued
well above shipments in December and order backlog rose further to a
level substantially above a year earlier.
Pressures for inventory accumulation also are strong,
particularly in business equipment and defense industries. Despite
steel inventory liquidation at a rate twice that after both the 1962
and 1963 steel settlements, business inventories were increasing in

the fourth quarter at a rate close to the high third quarter level.
In the current quarter, with steel liquidation ending, a step-up in the
rate of nonfarm inventory accumulation is likely.
Employment gains are expected to be as rapid in the current
as in the fourth quarter and an anticipated large rise in wage and
salary income will be supplemented by a large increase in Federal transfer
payments. Thus, a sizable further gain in personal income is in pros-
pect and, despite the boost in social security taxes, consumption
expenditures may show only a moderately smaller rise than in the fourth
quarter.
Resource utilization and prices
The surge in production and employment in late 1965 carried
rates of resource utilization to high levels. Through most of last year
manufacturing output was between 90 and 91 per cent of capacity but by
December it was estimated at 91.5 per cent,- the highest in a decade.
The unemployment rate dropped further to 4.1 per cent in December as
additions to the armed forces and increases in the number of trainees
under anti-poverty programs supplemented strong private demands for
labor.
As yet, pressure on resources has not been reflected in an
acceleration of the rise in the industrial price index, which has con-
tinued tocreep upward at an annual rate of about 1.5 per cent. Manu-
facturing wages have continued to rise at about the same rate as
productivity and labor costs per unit of output have been slightly
below the levels of the preceding two years.

I- 3
In some industries, however--notably in nonferrous metals,
paper, textile, and machinery--pressures on capacity are strong.
Demands for these products are continuing to rise as a result of high
private activity and rising defense spending.
There is likely to be a substantial drain on available man-
power resources in coming months. Labor markets are already showing
signs of tightening, with increased indications of anticipatory hirings
and job-shifting of the type associated with industrial boom conditions.
Even with an estimated growth of two million (annual rate) in the total
labor force, the latest target strength for the armed forces and the
prospective rapid increase in civilian employment are likely to bring
the unemployment rate down to 3.5 per cent or lower by midyear. Short-
ages of skilled workers undoubtedly will also increase further.
Under such conditions, upward price pressures may become
stronger and more pervasive than in 1965. So far, however, there has
not been much upward cost and price thrust from major industries which
contributed importantly to the inflations of the Korean War period and
the mid-1950's.
Business credit demands
Expanded business demands for external financing from banks and
security markets are likely to contribute to further upward pressures in
long-term interest rates as the spring progresses. Capital expenditures
on plant and equipment and inventories are expected to continue to
grow more than flows of funds to corporations from undistributed

I-4
profits and capital consumption allowances. Businesses anticipate
spending 7 per cent more on plant and equipment in the second quarter
than they spent in the fourth quarter of last year, and the rate of
inventory accumulation is expected to turn up in the first part of the
year. At the same time, undistributed profits will probably increase
only slowly, since it seems likely that much of the rise in after-tax
profits will be absorbed by higher dividend payments.
The continued squeeze on corporate financial positions is likely
to manifest itself in several ways. Corporate security flotations are
likely to be substantial. Moreover, business demands for bank credit
will probably also remain active. Expansion in business loans was
very heavy in December and appears to have been relatively strong
the end of the year.
As credit demand builds, upward interest rate pressures in
long-term markets are likely to become more pervasive, as businesses
compete for funds in security markets and as banks undertake further
portfolio adjustments. In order to accommodate business customers in
a period when deposit funds are more difficult and more costly to obtain
than in the past, banks may cut back on their acquisitions of municipal
bonds and mortgages. In addition, they are likely to firm lending terms
further, including a reduction in term loans, which will be a factor
pending to enlarge business capital market demands. Such adjustments
would tend to transmit existing pressures on banks to longer-term
markets.

I-5
Bank deposits
Time and savings deposit growth at commercial banks has been
at a reduced rate since November of last year. Although there has been
some pickup in CD inflows in recent days, it does not appear likely,
in the current financial environment, that time and savings deposit
inflows will climb back to the high rates of last year. Regulation Q
ceilings on savings deposits, the recent shortening of CD maturities
at New York banks, and increased cash needs of business would all seem
to work against such a development. Instead, it can be expected that
net inflows of time and savings deposits may continue at, or possibly
somewhat above, the pace of the past two months.
The smaller inflow since November of time and savings deposits
has been offset in part by larger increases in demand deposits. Private
demand deposit increased sharply in the second half of December, and
Government deposits in January. Continued transactions demand for
funds should contribute to further growth in private demand deposits
and in the money supply.
A reduced demand for CD's and other interest-bearing bank
deposits relative to demand deposits would, of course, tend to slow
bank credit growth unless the Federal Reserve made deliberate efforts
to offset it. The lower public demand for bank time and savings deposits
reflects not only the relatively attractive rates on market securities
but also apparently a reduced demand for financial assets generally in
a period of rising expenditures. Under such circumstances, banks having
to liquidate securities to meet loan demands may not find willing buyers
at current market rates.

I- 6
Balance of payments
A group of Government analysts has been meeting to consider
the balance of payments outlook for 1966. One of their tentative
conclusions is that little net improvement on capital account is to be
expected this year, despite the impact of tightening credit conditions
here and the voluntary restraint programs. Also, a rise in military
expenditures abroad is likely to match net gains in investment income.
Accordingly, any significant reduction in the "liquidity" deficit from
last year's $1.3 billion would require a further increase in the mer-
chandise trade surplus from the fourth quarter 1965 level. If, for
example, exports were to increase by 10 per cent over the year to the
fourth quarter of 1966, and imports by only 5 per cent, the 1966 deficit
might be less than $1/2 billion. If, on the other hand, as seemed
more likely to the group, imports and exports were each to rise about
7-1/2 per cent over the year, the deficit might be about the same in
1966 as in 1965.
Current and prospective business developments abroad carry
some unfavorable and some favorable implications for U.S. trade.
Taking one of the unfavorable elements first, it is increasingly
evident that the steady and rapid rise in British prices and costs
will necessitate additional actions this year to restrain the growth of
demand in Britain. Since Britain is the world's second largest inter-
national trader, U.S. exports would not escape the direct and indirect
effects of such actions.

I- 7
On the favorable side, the upswings in domestic activity that
got under way in Italy and France in 1965 have been continuing. In
both countries imports have already risen appreciably and are expected
to go on rising. A rise in Japanese imports seems also to be developing.
In Germany, aggregate demand from domestic and foreign sources has
continued to press on available resources, and there are no signs yet
of slackening in the rapid rise of German imports. The Canadian economy,
and Canadian imports, are booming. It is clear that expansionary
influences on world trade will predominate, and opportunities will be
open for rapid expansion of U.S. exports.
The question is whether pressures of domestic demand will limit
export growth and boost imports so much as to prevent a net balance of
payments gain. In the fourth quarter of 1965, imports approached 3.3
per cent of GNP, the highest ratio since late 1959, as a result of
marked expansion in imports both of industrial supplies and of
finished manufactures. A net payments gain in 1966 seems to require
that imports now advance a little less rapidly than GNP, with the ratio
between the two subsiding towards the average 1965 level of 3.1 per
cent.

THE ECONOMIC PICTURE IN DETAIL
The Nonfinancial Scene
Gross national product. GNP is now estimated by Commerce
at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $694.6 billion for the fourth
quarter, up $13 billion from the third quarter. The Board's staff is
now projecting a further rise of over $14 billion to $709 billion for
the first quarter.
This slight acceleration in the rise in GNP now projected
for the current quarter, however, may prove to be illusory if the fourth
quarter figures are revised up moderately. The present official fourth
quarter estimate is based on incomplete or preliminary monthly figures,
and new evidence has already become available suggesting that a few
major components -- and possibly the total -- may be subject to moderate
upward revision. For one thing, the recently announced sharp -- and
probably temporary -- spurt in housing starts in December will raise
the residential construction activity estimate. For another thing,
given the large rise in personal income now shown for the quarter, the
estimate for consumption expenditures may be too low. (In the present
consumption estimate preliminary retail sales figures have been used,
pending an imminent revision by Census of recent monthly figures on
the basis of a broadened and up-dated sample) Finally, business in-
ventory accumulation on a book value basis in October and November
(preliminary) slightly exceeded the third quarter rate, and this suggests
that the present estimate of nonfarm business inventory accumulation
is too low for the fourth quarter.

II -2
In the current quarter the Federal government continues to
be a strongly expansive force. On the basis of fiscal year Budget
estimates, Federal defense spending is now estimated at $54.5 billion,
annual rate, $1.8 billion higher than the staff projected three weeks
ago, and total Federal purchases show almost as much rise in the current
quarter ($2.8 billion) as in the fourth quarter ($3.2 billion) when
they were augmented by the military and civilian pay raises.
The large rise in business fixed investment projected for the
quarter is in line with findings of the latest Commerce-SEC survey.
The first quarter level of business fixed investment represents 10.6
per cent of GNP, up from 10.2 per cent a year ago, and as high as at
the peak of the 1956-57 investment boom. In the 1956-57 period, the
high rate of business fixed investment proved to be unsustainable,
but at the present time and in view of increased defense needs, the
immediate prospect is for further expansion in business investment.
The rise in residential construction activity results from the unex-
pected upturn in housing starts in late 1965. In view of the especially
favorable weather conditions the sharp December rise in housing starts
will probably prove to be temporary. The general outlook for residential
construction activity continues to be one of relative stability at the
reduced rates reached in the latter part of 1965.
A rise in nonfarm business inventory accumulation is posited
on the assumption that the rate of accumulation was limited by steel
liquidation in the fourth quarter and that this liquidation will end
in the current quarter. Apart from steel, business inventory

II -3
accumulation has been running at a relatively high rate -- pressures
for accumulation are particularly strong in business equipment and
defense industries in the durable goods sector.
Perhaps the only moderating influence from the demand side in
the current quarter may be the large boost in social security taxes
and its effect on limiting the rise in personal income and possibly
consumption expenditures. Disposable personal income is projected to
rise about $2.5 billion less in the current quarter than in the fourth
quarter, and with the spending rate likely to hold close to the fourth
quarter rate (94.3 as compared with 94.2) consumption expenditures are
expected to rise somewhat less in the current quarter. But if personal
income, as in the fourth quarter, continues to be more strongly
expansive than originally estimated and also if renewed escalation of
war in Vietnam tends to stimulate consumer buying propensities, we may
now be underestimating possible consumption expenditures in the current
quarter.
In real terms, projected first quarter GNP is 5.7 per cent
above a year ago. This would moderately exceed the rapid rate of growth
for the year 1965.

Industrial production. In December, industrial production
rose to 148.3 per cent of the 1957-59 average, 1.4 per cent above
November and 7.4 per cent above a year earlier. For the year as a
whole the index was 8 per cent above 1964. The large December rise in
output reflected primarily a sharp increase in production of industrial
materials, up 2 per cent. Output of final products rose one-half per
cent.
Auto assemblies were maintained at an annual rate of 9.3
million units, and in January, production continued at the same advanced
rate. Output of most other consumer goods-appliances, television sets,
furniture, and staples -- continued to expand in December. Production
of aircraft and commercial and defense equipment rose further and output
of industrial and farm machinery, as well as trucks, was maintained at
record levels.
Iron and steel output rose more than 5 per cent in December
from the November low, but was still about 15 per cent below the levels
of last spring and summer. In January, steel ingot production increased
further. By the end of November, inventories of steel mill products
at manufacturing consumers had declined 17 per cent from the August
peak and totaled 14.2 million tons -- equivalent to about a 2-1/2 months'
supply at 1965 consumption rates. In December, production of most other
materials, both durable and nondurable, also advanced.
The increase in industrial production since last September,
when output declined due to the sharp curtailment in steel production

II -6
and strikes in several industries, has been large and at a rate usually
associated with the early phase of recovery from a recession low.
the total index rose 3.3 per cent in the final three months and the total
excluding steel rose 3.7 per cent, to a level 8.5 per cent above
December 1964.
Retail sales. Retail sales rose 1 per cent in December after
showing little change in November and data for the first two weeks of
January suggest a further rise this month. Both durable and nondurable
goods have shared in the recent rise, with durables showing the largest
increase.
Despite a moderate decline in unit sales of autos, dollar
sales of auto dealers were up in December and total durable goods store
sales rose 2 per cent to exceed the previous high reached last February.
December sales of auto dealers were still 4 per cent below the record
February 1965 level, while all other durable goods combined were up
10 per cent.
The small rise in nondurable goods sales in December re-
flected mainly a pronounced gain at food stores as most other lines
showed little change or declined somewhat. December nondurable goods
sales were up 5-1/2 per cent from last February.
Unit sales of domestic autos in the first 20 days of January
were well above a month earlier, and even somewhat exceeded the very
high rate a year ago. The seasonally adjusted annual rate for the month
as a whole may be close to the record 9.6 million units set a year ago,
when sales were raised sharply by backlog demand following auto strikes.

II -7
Consumer credit. Demands for consumer credit continued
strong in December, according to a preliminary tabulation of commercial
bank data and scattered reports for other lenders. At commercial banks,
instalment debt outstanding increased sharply further by about $325
million, following the large rise of $353 million in November.
Borrowing to buy new cars slackened a bit at the banks in
December, but this probably reflected the slight downturn in new car
sales rather than any unseasonable shift from credit to cash purchases.
The volume of auto credit also depends on the size of the contract,
but here changes from one month to the next are usually small. Over a
longer period, however, the average size of auto contracts has been
creeping up by about $50 to $100 a year.
The seasonally adjusted increase in total instalment debt in
December probably amounted to about $675 million, about the same increase
as in November. Such a pace would result in a fourth quarter rate of
rise about in line with the third quarter but down a little from earlier
in the year.
Delinquency rates on consumer loans made by commercial banks,
as reported by the ABA, have shown a slight but persistent updrift
during most of the past year. Nonetheless in perspective, the rates
are still not high: 1 per cent for direct auto loans and well under
2 per cent for most other types of loans.

II -8
Orders for durable goods. New orders for durable goods in
December remained at the record October-November level, while shipments
edged up further and the backlog of unfilled orders continued to expand.
The ratio of unfilled orders to shipments at 2.84, was unchanged from
the two preceding months but was up from 2.62 a year earlier.
New orders for defense products receded further from the
exceptionally high September-October level and about equalled ship-
ments, so that unfilled orders were unchanged. However, the defense
order backlog has increased 13 per cent since mid-1965 and 22 per cent
over the past year, as compared with increases in shipments of 4
and 9 per cent, respectively.
New orders for steel increased substantially further in
December, moderately exceeding shipments, which also rose, and unfilled
orders showed a small pick-up following 9 months of decline, New
orders for machinery and equipment were about unchanged and well above
shipments, and the order backlog showed a sizable further rise to a
level 18 per cent above a year earlier; shipments rose about 10 per
cent over the year.
Business inventories. Overall inventory accumulation in the
fourth quarter appears to have been about as large as in the third
quarter despite the rapid liquidation of steel stocks. The November
increase in book value of business inventories was about as large as
in October and the two months' average slightly exceeded the third

II -9
quarter rate. Accumulation by durable goods manufacturers was down from
the high third quarter rate, but rising inventory requirements for
business equipment and defense industries kept overall durable goods
accumulation unexpectedly large. Nondurable goods stocks rose much
more rapidly than in the third quarter. Trade inventory accumulation
in October and November was stepped-up considerably from the unusually
low third quarter rate although it was down sharply from the pace in
the first half of the year when auto inventory accumulation was
especially large.

Residential construction. Seasonally adjusted housing starts
rose sharply further in December to a rate nearly a fourth above the
reduced October level. The fourth quarter average was the highest of
the year. Even so, the total for the year, 1.5 million, was down 3
per cent from 1964, the same amount as from 1963 to 1964.

II -10
The further rise in starts in December may have reflected,
in part at least, more than usual difficulties of seasonal and other
statistical measurement. By region, there was no consistent pattern
in the movement of starts even in terms of direction of change. Much
of the rise was concentrated in the North Central states, which benefited
from exceptionally favorable weather conditions. While seasonally
adjusted starts also continued to increase in the South, they declined
in the North East and reached a new low for recent years in the West.
Building permits also rose in December. (Partly because
of an adjustment for working days, this series is somewhat less volatile
than starts.) All types of structures shared in the increase, but,
as in the case of starts, regional differences were marked.

Personal income. Personal income in December increased $4.4
billion to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $550.5 billion, a level
$38.5 billion or 7.5 per cent above a year earlier.

II -11
The December increase was centered in wage and salaries
which rose sharply, mainly because of higher employment. The December
payroll rise -- $3 billion -- although not quite so large as in the
two preceding months, was much larger than in any earlier month of
1965.
For 1965 as a whole, personal income totaled $530.7 billion,
7.2 per cent more than in 1964. Wage and salary disbursements also
increased 7.2 per cent, with manufacturing payrolls up 7.7 per cent.
Transfer payments rose $2.6 billion, or 7.1 per cent, with about half
of the rise resulting from liberalization of old-age and survivors
insurance benefits. Farm income rose exceptionally sharply -- by $2.3
billion, or 19 per cent -- mainly because of higher prices for hogs
and cattle and for some field crops and vegetables.
Employment and labor force. Expansion in nonfarm employment
in December, as in November, was very large -- about double the amount
in earlier months in 1965. Confirmation of the sharp acceleration in
demands for workers at year-end was apparent in almost all labor market
data. Total employment from the household survey showed an average
increase of 450,000 per month in the two-month period, while nonfarm
establishment employment averaged 400,000 higher. The sharp expansion
in labor force, the decline in unemployment of primary workers, record
help-wanted advertising and rising turnover in manufacturing, also
indicate a sharp step-up in manpower demands and a growing stringency
in labor supply.

II -12
In part, recent high demands reflect the addition of growing
defense activity to already rising consumer and business outlays.
However, with gains in employment so large and widespread among industries,
some anticipatory hiring also may have been taking place, to assure
that adequate labor will be on hand to meet expected further increases
in private and defense output. Changed expectations may be seen in
the shift in employers' attitudes toward hiring and paying the additional
costs for new workers. Earlier, employers resisted adding inexperienced
workers because of possible future layoffs, high built-in fringe
benefits and training expenses -- in many instances, the workweek was
extended to limit new additions to the work force. Now, employers'
efforts seem to be directed toward hiring new workers about as rapidly
as they become available.

An important feature of the November-December employment rise
was its wide dispersion among industries. The magnitude of some
increases may represent especially favorable weather conditions or
unusual seasonal holiday requirements coinciding with the availability
of a large number of part-time workers. But the widespread nature of
the expansion in employment suggests that rising output and expectations
of possible future labor shortages were also important influences.
Highlighting the sharp overall rise was a sizable gain in construction
employment following a period of relative stability during most of 1965.
Trade and Government employment also rose more rapidly than earlier,
while services maintained high rates of increase.
In manufacturing, gains were general but notable increases
occurred in rubber, chemicals, textiles, apparel and food -- industries
which had shown little change after the first quarter of 1965. Even
though steel employment was reduced because of inventory liquidation
in November and December, total durable goods employment increased
faster than at any time since the first quarter of 1965 and was well
above the average monthly increase for the year. The workweek was
maintained at the postwar high level of 41.4 hours.

A positive test of heightened pressure in the labor market
is a high and rising rate of factory turnover, especially voluntary
quit rates. The pull of increased job openings at higher grades and
better pay tends to lift the rate of quits among employees, while
for employers it implies increased hiring of employed workers in
occupational categories which may not be readily found among the
unemployed or new entrants. These indicators of manpower demands are
close to those experienced during the Korean War.
In November (latest data available) voluntary quits jumped
to 22 per 1,000, well above last year and most earlier expansionary
periods and only moderately below 1951 rates. At the same time, layoff
rates, as might be expected, have declined -- to even lower rates than
in the early 1950's. Meanwhile hiring rates have increased sub-
stantially both to expand employment and offset voluntary and
involuntary separations. Rising quit rates have two major effects:
on the one hand, it increases mobility and affords more efficient

II -15
utlization of available skills; on the other, it represents increased
pressure on wages as employers attempt to prevent employees from
quitting, or to induce other workers to leave their current jobs.
Most of the increase in employment in the past two months
has come from the larger-than-expected influx of youth and women into
the labor force in response to expanded demands. The 900,000 rise
in total employment and the 80,000 additions to the armed forces in
November and December were accounted for by an increase of more than
800,000 in the labor force and a reduction in unemployment of 150,000.
The overall unemployment rate in December was down to 4.1
per cent with the rate for adult men falling to 2.3 per cent and for
married men to 1.8 per cent. Thus, although the overall unemployment
rate is now about the same as in the expansion period of 1956 and early
1957, the increased demand for experienced workers has brought the
rates for adult men down to about the levels in the Korean period
of early 1952 -- the overall rate then was about 3 per cent. The
greater number of young people who are in the labor force currently,
many of whom are apparently having difficulty finding jobs because of
inexperience, account for most of the difference in the two periods.
In addition, the build-up of the armed forces was larger and more
rapid in the earlier period -- about 1-3/4 million men were added to the
armed forces within one year after the outbreak of hostilities resulting
in a sharp drop in unemployment among youth. The armed forces had a
strength of almost 3.7 million at the Korean peak in the spring of 1952.

II -16
In August of 1965, the planned size of the armed forces
was increased by over 300,000 to 2,980,000. By December more than
150,000 men had been added to existing strength. Recently the
Secretary of Defense proposed increasing the armed forces by an
additional 113,000 or by a total of over 400,000 since the start of
Vietnam hostilities. It is expected that this new goal will be
attained by about midyear 1966. This would imply a rise of 250,000
between December 1965 and the summer of 1966 -- a monthly rate of about
40,000, approximately the same as in November and December. Apparently
the new goal can be attained with draft calls remaining at 30,000 to
40,000 a month, if voluntary enlistments remain as high as in recent
months.
Wages and labor costs. Relative stability in unit labor
costs in manufacturing has continued to be an important influence in
limiting advances in industrial prices. Outside of manufacturing, wage
gains also reflected increased demands and reduced labor supplies,
with wage increases generally above the guideposts.

Average hourly earnings in factories at $2.66 in December
were 3.1 per cent above the same month last year. This is about in line
with the average rise for 1965. While productivity advances in manu-
facturing were at a slightly slower pace in 1965 -- 3.6 per cent compared
with over 4 per cent in 1964 -- nevertheless, they were above gains in
hourly compensation and unit labor costs showed a small downtrend during
the year. (Recent revision in the unit labor cost index both because
of higher output figures and a small downward revision in wage and
salary compensation have lowered the index. In the fourth quarter it
was 98.3, and the annual average for 1965 was 98.9. Comparable figures
for 1964 were 99.9 and 99.6.)
Most nonmanufacturing industries for which hourly earnings
data are available continue to show above guidepost trend productivity
gains in November (latest data available) and apparently were exerting
upward pressure on prices in retail trade and services.
Wage contracts in 1966. Wage increases stemming from major
collective bargaining contracts in manufacturing should continue to be
rather limited in 1966. A smaller number of workers are covered by
contracts that terminate or provide for a wage reopening than in 1965,
and about four-fifths of the workers covered by contract expirations
will not be subject to wage changes until midyear or after. Major
nationwide negotiations will take place in electrical equipment in
October. In addition scattered contract terminations are scheduled in

II -18
construction in the spring and summer and in printing, apparel, shoes
and textiles in the fall. Considerable bargaining activity may also
result from possible wage reopenings for operating railroad workers,
bitumunous coal and telephone workers early in 1966.
Another factor helping to stabilize wage negotiations is the
large number of workers (4.3 million, of which 2.1 million are in manu-
facturing) who will receive automatic wage increases based on earlier
contracts. In almost all instances the amount of increase provided
for in 1966 will be within the guidepost or close to it. Automobile,
steel, aerospace, nonelectrical machinery, nonoperating railroad
employees, and truckers will receive increases in compensation ranging
from 3.0 to 3.5 per cent per hour in 1966. In construction, however,
750,000 workers are scheduled to receive automatic wage increases larger
than those in most other major industries.
About 2 million workers are covered under cost-of-living
escalator clauses in 1966, about the same number as in the previous
two years but well below the 4.0 million total in 1959. These clauses
are now mainly restricted to workers in the automobile, aerospace,
meatpacking and trucking industries, although some workers in chemicals,
retail trade and public transit also have their wages tied to change
in the consumer price index.
The Administration intends to maintain the wage guidepost
at 3.2 per cent although calculation of the 5-year productivity factor
now comes to 3.6 per cent (an additional .2 from upward revisions in

II -19
private GNP and .2 from dropping 1960 and substituting 1965 in the
5-year average). The Council contends that the last 5 years is tempo-
rarily high and no longer a reasonable approximation of a true pro-
ductivity trend, since it was due mainly to increased operating rates
rather than from more efficient utilization of equipment and manpower.
Wholesale prices. The industrial commodity price index rose
.1 per cent further from mid-November to mid-December, and estimates
indicate an additional .1 per cent rise into late January to 102.9
per cent of the 1957-59 average. Since September 1964, the industrial
index has increased at a relatively even pace of about 1.5 per cent
per year. Average prices of foodstuffs continued to rise in December
and January chiefly because of sharp additional increases in livestock
and meats, and the total wholesale price index rose 1 per cent further.
Some types of nonelectrical machinery continued to rise in
December while electrical machinery remained stable, and the average
for machinery and equipment increased .1 per cent further. Prices of
metal working and other nonelectrical machinery have increased sub-
stantially since early 1963, when the rapid rise in capital spending
began, and the average for all machinery and equipment has increased
about 3 per cent during the three years. Some part of these increases is
attributable to unmeasured quality improvement.
Hides and leather prices rose sharply further in December and
January. The prolonged drought in Argentina -- a major world hide

II -20
supplier -- and the spreading of hoof and mouth disease out of the Ukraine
into western Europe have been major influences in addition to strong
world demand.
The price index for steel mill products rose slightly in
December, reflecting the previously announced increases in tinplate,
and prices of tin cans were raised. The index for nonferrous metals
declined somewhat primarily as a result of the rollback in copper prices.
In the "free" markets, copper prices have reached new highs, and the
rise in average prices paid may account for scattered price increases
in plumbing equipment in December.
The Government last week applied a virtual embargo on the
export of domestically produced copper in both ore and semirefined form,
and also placed strict quotas on the export of other copper products.
The policy grew out of the 14 per cent differential between domestic
and foreign producer prices and the continuing worldwide shortage of
the metal. Further releases of copper from the strategic stockpile --
either through Congressional legislation or Presidential emergency
directive -- are expected this spring. Domestic stocks of other major
nonferrous metals remain low, but production continues to expand in line
with consumption. Moreover, large amounts of these metals in the
stockpile have been declared by the Office of Emergency Planning to be
in excess of national security needs, and consequently are available
in the event of shortages.

II -21
The sharp rise in prices of foodstuffs over the past year is
attributable mainly to a reduction in marketings of hogs. Hog prices
are about 75 per cent above a year ago and at a 17-year high. In the
next several months marketings are expected to remain below and prices
above the levels of a year ago. By the second half of 1966, however,
expanded production of hogs induced by current high prices is expected
to result in increased marketings and consequently in price declines.

Farm land values. The rise in prices of farm land continued in
the year ending on November 1, 1965. In that 12-month period, the national
average index rose 6.6 per cent to 145 (1957-59-100), according to confi-
dential figures of the Department of Agriculture, compared with 6.2 per
cent in the preceding year and 5.8 per cent in the year ending November 1,
1963.
Values rose in each Federal Reserve District in the latest
period with increases ranging from about 5.5 per cent in the Cleveland,
Richmond and San Francisco Districts up to 8.2 per cent in the Atlanta
District. In the Dallas District, values continued to fluctuate sharply
in response to drought and to other factors; they increased only 2 per
cent in the latest year following an increase of 10 per cent in the
preceding year.
Undoubtedly the generally improved farm incomes of 1965 and
the favorable prospects in view for further improvement in income in
1966 are reflected in the sustained strength of land values nationally,
and in the accelerated rise in values in the great feed grain and live-
stock areas of the Midwest and the Northern Plains. Rates of increase
in the year ending on November 1, 1965 accelerated in the Chicago, Minneapolis,
Kansas City, and Boston Districts, where increases in gross farm incomes
during 1965 were sharpest. Values in these districts, except Kansas City,
had tended to lag behind the national average in earlier years.
The largest increases in recent years (since 1957-59) have
been in the Atlanta, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts--areas experiencing

II -23
rapid growth in population and urbanization and technological changes
in farming. The smallest increases have been in Chicago, Cleveland,
Minneapolis Districts--established agricultural areas where land values
are more nearly related to purely agricultural uses.
Meat and poultry supplies. Per capita meat supplies in the
current quarter will probably fall short of year-ago supplies because of
continued shortages of pork. Hog slaughter is estimated to be down 13
to 15 per cent. In the second quarter, it will be only about 5 per cent
under the low for last year. In the second half of the year, a gradual
expansion is in prospect up to 6 per cent above a year earlier by the
fourth quarter.
Supplies of both beef and poultry meat are expected to be
larger in the current quarter than a year ago. The number and weights
of cattle on feed on January 1 point to marketing of fed beef throughout
the first half of the year at levels above those of 1965. Broiler pro-
duction is now 13 per cent above a year ago and further increases are in
prospect; broiler prices are expected to decline from current high levels.
Altogether, the shortage of meats should ease by the autumn of
this year. In fact, USDA analysts are concerned about possible over-
expansion of broiler production in the fall of 1966 and of pork in late
1967. If the peak in the cattle numbers cycle was passed in 1965 as
balance sheet data indicate, cattle available for feeding and herd re-
placement may be somewhat smaller in 1967 and for sometime thereafter.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL SITUATION
Bank credit. From late December to mid-January, total loans
and investments of weekly reporting banks declined more than usual,
despite delivery this month of $1 billion of bills carrying full tax
and loan credit. Strong pressures on bank liquidity apparently have led
to rapid secondary distribution of new Treasury issues and a relatively
prompt distribution of the $1.5 billion of certificates delivered last
week also seems likely. Further indications of the relatively tight
position of these banks are provided by their much larger than usual
liquidation of municipal and agency securities over recent weeks.
Total loans since the latter part of December also have de-
clined more than a year earlier, mainly because of large reductions in
security loans. Pay-downs by Government security dealers were sizable,
reflecting reductions in their portfolios of bills. Business loans,
however, continue to expand markedly--particularly in New York. Our
tentative estimate of business loan expansion in January is for a
seasonally adjusted increase of about $1 billion, or about as much as
the average monthly expansion of 1965. Such an increase will follow a
near record rise in business loans in December.
Bank deposits and the money supply. In sharp contrast to the
experience after previous changes in Regulation Q, increased returns
available on time deposits and market securities have not yet had much
impact on the growth rate of money balances, mainly because the public's

III -2
demand for money has been increased significantly by the buoyant pace
of economic activity. As a result, the money stock is likely to show
a seasonally adjusted annual rate of growth of around 10 per cent in
January, only moderately below last month's 12.3 per cent rate. Most
of the January rise reflects the high level of money balances carried
over from the end of December, but higher yields have not caused these
balances to be converted into other financial assets. At the same time,
time and savings deposit growth has slowed rather than accelerated;
January expansion appears likely to be only a little more than one-half
of the December rate of 12.4 per cent. In January 1965, following the
previous change in Regulation Q, time and savings deposits grew at an
annual rate of 21 per cent and the money stock declined slightly.
The difficulty and cost of attracting a larger inflow of time
and savings deposits this year have been major factors in maintaining
pressure on bank loans and investments. Over the first two weeks of
January, time and savings deposits at weekly reporting banks expanded
only one-fifth as much as in the same period last year, and New York
City banks actually suffered declines. Both savings deposits and
negotiable CD's contracted at all weekly reporting banks--especially
those in New York--compared with rapid expansion at this time last
year. Time deposits other than negotiable CD's, on the other hand,
expanded quite sharply in early January at banks outside of New York
City.

The chief element in the slowdown of time and savings deposit
expansion early in 1966 has been the decline in CD's outstanding (see
accompanying table). Despite increases in rates paid by banks, CD
yields have not risen as rapidly as those on bills. In addition, the
state of business liquidity relative to short-term spending plans may
have reduced the pool of funds available for banks to tap. Both the
strength of business loan demands and the marked further increase in
money balances these past two months suggest a continued rapid expansion
in business expenditures for goods and services. This may be generating
an unusual strain on business liquidity positions, preventing banks
from increasing their outstanding CD's even while paying rates of 5 per
cent or more.
The 4 per cent ceiling on savings deposit rates may also have
limited the ability of banks to compete for these balances. Banks
outside of New York City apparently have made up part, but not all, of
the difference by issuance of non-negotiable certificates under the new
rate ceilings.
The resulting pressure on banks from the slowdown of time and
savings deposit inflow in the first two weeks of January had been
particularly severe in New York City, where both CD's and savings de-
posits declined and time deposits other than negotiable CD's grew by
less than last year. However, these banks were able to increase their
outstanding CD's by $127 million during the last reporting week, and very
large net inflows in the last few days have also been reported. This

III -5
increased inflow of negotiable CD's to New York City banks probably
reflects both the recent decline in bill yields and the appearance
of what may be only a temporary availability of investment funds. The
need of New York banks to obtain funds whenever the market is favorable
is especially great since they face large maturities in coming weeks
due to their emphasis on shorter-term CD's in the last month or so.
U.S. Government securities market. Yields on Treasury notes
and bonds have moved up recently after declining earlier in January
while Treasury bill rates have turned down very recently after rising
through mid-January. The seesaw movement of Treasury bond yields in
recent weeks appears to have reflected the immediate technical condi-
tion of the market rather than any change in the market's outlook for
long-term yields. Dealers have had net short positions in coupon
issues due in more than 1-year since early January but recently they
have built up their holdings of bonds due in over 20-years as a conse-
quence of net investor selling in that maturity area. Apart from this
selling, the Treasury bond market has been influenced recently by fading
prospects for peace in Vietnam and continuing signs of strength in the
domestic economy. Many market participants have also directed their
attention to the higher spending figures and larger financial asset sales
contained in the Federal Budget rather than to the smaller Administrative
Budget deficit or the small Cash Budget surplus indicated for fiscal
1967.

Treasury bill rates extended their earlier advance through mid-
January but have since declined somewhat. After being auctioned at a
record high average rate of 4.673 per cent on January 17, the 3-month
bill fell back to an average of 4.596 per cent in the January 24 auction.
The recent decline in bill rates has reflected the strong cumulative de-
mand for bills, the resulting reduction in dealer inventories, and the
emergence of more comfortable conditions in the central money markets
which have been accompanied by a decline in dealer financing costs.
Yields on most other short-term debt instruments have continued
to rise in recent weeks:

Corporate and municipal bond markets. Despite an unseasonably
large January supply of new offerings, yields on corporate and municipal
bonds have not risen above the levels reached in December following the
discount rate action. In fact, municipal bond yields declined slightly
through the third week of January. Reoffering yields on new corporate

III -8
bonds in early January were below those in December, but investor re-
action was lukewarm. Subsequently, when syndicates on several of these
issues were broken, their yields rose 4 to 7 basis points in the secondary
market about to the highs for recently offered issues reached at mid-
December. The further yield advance on seasoned corporate bonds through
December carried the Aaa-rated average on these securities to the highest
levels since the early 1930's.

The tendency for yields on municipal bonds to edge lower during
the first three weeks of January apparently reflected seasonal demand.
Although the flow of new offerings remained large, dealers' advertised
inventories rose less than $50 million from the relatively low level
of $450 million reached late in 1965. Strength of demand for municipals
was surprising in view of indications that large city banks are allow-
ing some of their municipal holdings to run-off without replacement,
in order to improve their liquidity positions.
Announcement of the $250 million financing by New York City
for the current week raised the total January volume of municipal

III -10
offerings to nearly $1.2 billion. Since the February calendar promises
to be nearly as large, the municipal bond market is about to experience
a testing of current yield levels.
Mortgage markets. In January, adjustments in mortgage yields
were apparently continuing in response to the general advice of other
capital market rates in December and the intensified competition for
savings flows which has followed the Regulation Q action. In December,
secondary market yields on 30-year, 5-1/4 per cent FHA-insured mort-
gages advanced 11 basis points further after a 7 basis point rise
during the previous four months. The average of 5.62 per cent was the
highest since May of 1962. Even so, the advance was matched by the rise
in yields on offerings of new corporate bonds, adjusted to an Aaa basis,
so that the already narrow spread in favor of mortgages was no more
than maintained.
In response to continued demand pressures on its own re-
sources, effective January 18, FNMA announced a further reduction of one
percentage point for eligible home mortgages offered for purchase under
its secondary market operations. The reduction--equivalent to about 12
basis points on yield--was the second such adjustment in less than six
weeks. FNMA also raised the issue price of common stock required to
be bought by those selling it mortgages under its secondary market
operations. And further to stem what has been a record volume of offer-
ings, it also indicated that it would limit its purchases to mortgages
offered within four months after underwriting by FHA or VA. According

III -11
to testimony of the FHA commissioner, an increase in the current 5-1/4
per cent contract rate on FHA-insured mortgages is under consideration.
In the market for conventional mortgages, contract interest
rates also advanced further in December, based on reports from the
Federal Housing Administration. Rates for loans for new homes reached
6.00 per cent, 10 basis points above the November average and 15 basis
points above the earlier level which had continued for more than two
years. Loans on existing homes showed a similar pattern of increase,
reaching 6.05 per cent in December.
In November, adjustments in nonrate terms for conventional
mortgages had moved counter to contract rates, according to the
Federal Home Loan Bank Board survey. However, during December, both
maturities and loan-to-value ratios on loans for new homes tightened
somewhat again. Comparable terms for loans on existing properties
were liberalized further, but this appeared to be largely seasonal.

Stock market. Trading activity on the New York Stock Exchange
during January has continued at the very high level of last fall while
common stock prices have posted further gains. The volume of daily
transactions during the first three weeks of January averaged somewhat
above the 8.7 million shares daily for December, the peak month in the
history of the Exchange. And on January 25, the Standard and Poor's
composite price index closed at 93.85, almost 4 per cent above last
May's peak.
Recent evidence of continued economic expansion, further up-
ward adjustments in forecasts of future economic growth, a growing pre-
sumption that Federal spending may exceed totals announced in the new
budget, and favorable year-end reports of corporate earnings and
dividends have all contributed to the further advance of stock prices.
At the same time, however, uncertainties about the war in Vietnam--both
as to the possibilities of peace and whether further escalation would
lead to new taxes on corporate income--have acted as a brake on price
advances. In addition, profit-taking at the start of the new tax
year seems to have been larger than usual, possibly reflecting questions
being raised about the sustainability of present stock prices as the
Dow-Jones industrial average has pressed toward the unprecedented 1000
mark.
Customer credit provided by banks and brokers in the stock
market rose $400 million during December to a total of $7.7 billion.
Most of this increase was attributable to a $312 million expansion in
customers' net debit balances on securities other than Governments.

III -13
Since July net debit balances have risen $660 million or 13-1/2 per
cent, nearly offsetting all of the decline which occurred in this
form of stock market credit from the November 1963 change in margin
requirements through July 1965. While a part of this recent credit
growth reflects increases in clearing balances associated with the
greatly enlarged volume of trading activity, the bulk of the change
represents expanded margin buying.

U.S. balance of payments. As measured on the liquidity
basis, the fourth quarter balance of payments deficit is now estimated
at $350 million, revised upward from earlier estimates as a result of
a very small deficit for December instead of the surplus that had been
suggested by preliminary indicators. The deficit for the year of
$1.3 billion was financed almost entirely by a reduction in U.S.
monetary reserves; U.S. liquid liabilities to foreigners increased
less than $100 million. Foreign gold purchases were $1.3 billion,
and in addition the U.S. gold stock was reduced during the year by
sales of $117 million to industry and by the gold subscription payment
of $259 million to the IMF for the increase in the U.S. quota. There
was a $95 million increase in the U.S. gold tranche position in the
IMF, and a $350 million rise in holdings of convertible currencies.
On a year-to-year comparison, the deficit was reduced by about
$1-1/2 billion on the liquidity basis (and also on regular transactions).
On official settlements, the fourth quarter deficit is now
estimated at $1.1 billion. This figure is sharply higher than earlier
estimates primarily because of the substantial rise in December in
liquid liabilities to foreign official institutions; however, it has
also been increased by $160 million reflecting a decision by a
technical committee on the balance of payments to include among the
items measuring the deficit on official settlements non-convertible

IV -2
dollar Roosa bonds. For the year, the deficit on official settlements
was $1.3 billion, compared to $1.2 billion in 1964. In 1965 the
official settlements deficit was financed primarily through re-
ductions in U.S. monetary reserve assets, whereas in 1964 it had
been financed largely by increases in foreign official dollar holdings.
So far this year there appear to have been heavy weekly
deficits on the liquidity basis,partly reflecting the resumption of
Canadian borrowing which had been delayed in the fourth quarter.
Total new issues of Canadian securities are expected to be close to
$200 million in January, almost as much as the outflow in the whole
fourth quarter.
With respect to credit transactions under the VFCR, partial
data for December show an increase of about $150 million in foreign
assets held by U.S. banks under the program. Seasonal increases in
bank loans and acceptance credits in past Decembers have amounted to
upwards of $200 million. While the VFCR ceilings for 1965 would
have permitted an outflow of up to $475 million, it now appears that
the total net outflow for the year may have been as low as $50 to
$100 million under the program. Total claims on foreigners re-
ported by banks in the United States (including claims reported for
customer account and claims by branches and agencies of foreign
banks) showed a net reflow through November (not adjusted for seasonal
influences); for the year 1965 they may well show a smaller net outflow
than reported under the VFCR, primarily reflecting the net reduction
in customers' claims.

IV -3
Foreign trade statistics for December just released by Census
again require adjustment for statistical distortions. The adjustments
remove the impression of a sharp rise in imports in that month, but
total fourth-quarter imports (on the balance of payments basis,
adjusted) were up 5 per cent from the third quarter, to an annual rate
of over $23 billion. Exports (balance of payments basis) rose 4 per
cent from the third to the fourth quarter, and exceeded $28 billion at
an annual rate.
Exports to Canada continued to show extraordinary strength
last autumn, reaching a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $6 billion
in September-November, up 6 per cent from June-August. Exports to
continental Europe appear to have picked up in October and November,
and the three-month weighted moving average used in the chart to even
out some of the month-to-month fluctuations rose to $7.4 billion in
September-November, 3 per cent above its average level in the preceding
three months. Exports to Latin America also looked a little more
in October and November than they did earlier in the year, but
exports to other less-developed countries were down quite sharply.
Business conditions abroad. Rising consumer expenditure
has been a common feature of economic developments in all the leading
industrial countries in recent months. Private investment expenditure
has been rising in some countries but declining in others. In Italy
and Japan the contribution of export sales to growth of total demand
was somewhat less last autumn than it had previously been, but this
may have been only a temporary development. In virtually all in-
dustrial countries, except Britain, imports have been increasing as
a result of rising domestic demands.

IV -4
Advances in industrial production from the fourth quarter
of 1964 to October 1965 appear to have been about 7 per cent in
Canada and Italy and about 4 per cent in France; if measured from the
first-quarter-1965 low, the rise in France was comparable in terms of
annual rate to the other two. In Japan there are still only few indi-
cations of recovery; industrial output in October-November was up only
1 per cent from 1964-IV. In Britain and Germany, where demand remained
strong, severe shortages of skilled labor kept output increases to
1 per cent and 4 per cent respectively; measured from the first-quarter
average, there was little or no increase in either of these two countries.

Unemployment averaged only 3.4 per cent of the labor force
in October-December. With domestic resources under mounting strain,
advances in domestic prices and wages accelerated. In December, the
consumer price index was 2.9 per cent above December 1964. On the
wage front, average hourly earnings in manufacturing by September had
moved up nearly 6 per cent from a year earlier.
Sustained economic expansion also brought a large increase in
imports last year. In September-October imports were about one-fifth
higher than a year earlier. For the first ten months of 1965, imports
averaged 13 per cent higher than in the corresponding months of 1964,
and this was the principal factor in dissipation of the previous year's
strength in the Canadian balance of payments.
The Italian recovery faltered a little during the summer;
monthly industrial production showed no net advance from June to September.
An important factor was a decline in exports. Following a rise of over
40 per cent in the two years to April-June 1965, Italian exports fell
off 2 per cent between then and September-October. Automobile and steel
production, both of which had risen swiftly during the first half of
1965, declined in the summer.
Italian imports, on the other hand, showed an accelerating
rise during the summer, and by September-October were one-sixth above
their low level of the second half of 1964. Underlying this recovery
in imports was a continuing advance in consumption. Italian analysts
estimate that fixed investment outlays had not yet turned up last
autumn, and the trend of construction activity appeared to be still
downward last summer. Government expenditures have probably been rising.

IV -6
Price and wage rate increases in Italy, though large by
recent North American standards, have continued to be much more
moderate than in the three previous years. Year-to-year increases
are: wholesale prices, 2.0 per cent (as of September); consumer
prices, 3.6 per cent, and hourly wage rates in manufacturing, 7.2 per
cent (as of October).
In France, the advance in business activity, renewed early
last year, gained added momentum in September from the good reception
given new French auto models in both the domestic and export markets,
and also from further gains in consumer spending on apparel. Businesses
increasingly regarded their inventories as low, and stepped up orders.
The moderate relaxation of instalment credit regulations at the end
of June proved helpful. Consumer incomes have been rising, though less
rapidly than before mid-1964; hourly wage rates at the beginning of
October were about 6 per cent above their level a year earlier. The
average work week held at the level to which it had risen in the second
quarter. By October and November seasonally adjusted unemployment was
showing its first decline since early 1964.
New orders for machinery and equipment stayed at a relatively
depressed level in September-October. Construction activity, however,
continued at advanced levels. While private residential building prospects
for next spring are considered rather weak, public works outlays have
apparently been maintaining an upward trend.
Exports in the fourth quarter were up 7 per cent from the
second quarter. Nevertheless, France's trade balance (exports fo.b.,

IV -7
imports c.i.f.) moved into deficit again, as fourth-quarter imports
were 12 per cent above their second-quarter rate. Despite this evidence
of stiffening demand, price advances for manufactured products continued
minimal at both wholesale and retail levels. Prices of foodstuffs and
of services, however, were rising, and the over-all consumer price
index in September-October was up 2.4 per cent in a year.
Japanese industrial production, after beginning to rise a
little last summer, stabilized again in October-November. The earlier
upturn reflected continuing advance in output of consumer nondurables
and also beginning of recovery for consumer durables after a year and
a half of decline. Recovery seemed evident also in new orders for
machinery, but ouput of machinery stayed on the plateau it reached at
the end of 1964. Interruption of the over-all advance after September
appears to have reflected a 7 per cent drop in exports from the third
to the fourth quarter, which was particularly marked in exports of
steel to the United States. This downturn in exports followed a rise
of about 60 per cent since mid-1963.
Japanese imports, which had shown no net advance from the
fourth quarter of 1964 to the third quarter of 1965, moved up in
November-December; in the fourth quarter they averaged 4 per cent
higher than in the third. December price levels were up from a year
earlier by 1.6 per cent at wholesale, while the consumer price index
was up 6 per cent.
The current economic situation of Germany differs from those
of Italy, France and Japan in that the pressures of demand have been

IV -8
continuously severe throughout the past two years. During 1965 a
precarious balance was maintained between demand and supply, with
domestic new orders on a plateau, with export orders and shipments
also relatively level, and with imports rising sharply -- by more than
40 per cent from the last quarter of 1963 to the last quarter of
1965. Labor shortages have been the primary limitation on
domestic output growth. In some industries, especially steel, the
combination of competition from imports and slackened domestic demand
for inventories has resulted in some underutilization of plant capacity.
New orders for finished goods (both consumer and investment
goods) stepped up in September, and industrial output rose appreciably
in October, but this advance was not wholly sustained in November.
Average hourly earnings in industry were 10.6 per cent higher
in July than a year earlier, and this trend probably continued later
in the year. The cost of living index, however, rose a little less
than 4 per cent in the twelve months to November, and wholesale prices
of industrial products rose only 1.8 per cent. To moderate inflationary
pressures in 1966, monetary policy remains very tight and efforts are
being made to restrain the growth of government expenditures. At the
federal level the budget for 1966, calling for expenditures about 5 per
cent above actual outlays in 1965 (and about 10 per cent above those
originally budgeted for 1965) will be voted on in the near future.
In Britain, productivity gains appear to have been smaller
than in Germany and price advances have been greater. Wholesale prices
of manufactures in December were 3.4 per cent above their position a
year earlier. Retail prices (all items) were up 4.5 per cent.

IV -9
While total industrial production in Britain was virtually
level from February through November, automobile output dropped sharply
during the first half year. Production of textiles and apparel, on
the other hand, tended to rise on into the third quarter. These
developments corresponded to changes in consumer buying. Auto buying,
curtailed by credit tightness, stabilized after April on a level about
one-fourth below its high at the beginning of 1965. Retail sales
(excluding autos), on the other hand, were 3 per cent higher in volume
and 5 per cent higher at current prices in November than at the beginning
of the year.
Inventory investment, which had slackened off during the
second half of 1964 and early 1965, increased in the second and again
in the third quarter. Residential construction contracts declined
further at that time,but inflows of savings to building associations
during the summer led to a sharp expansion of mortgage lending in the
fourth quarter. Fixed capital outlays by manufacturing companies fell
off in the second quarter but picked up a little again in the third.
Surveys of investment intentions taken in November-December suggested
little change in plans for machinery expenditure in the near future.
Exports, which had risen encouragingly last summer, increased
further in the fourth quarter and were 7 per cent above the fourth
quarter of 1964. The gains reflected, among other things, final de-
liveries on some industrial equipment contracts that had been in the
pipeline for 12 to 18 months. New export orders for machinery and
equipment were on a somewhat lower level in 1965 than in 1964.
British imports leveled off after May. In November-December
they were 2 per cent higher than a year earlier.

APPENDIX A: PROPOSED NEW SPEED-UP OF CORPORATE TAX PAYMENTS
The President's proposal in his State of the Union Message
to further accelerate corporation tax payments to a pay-as-you-go
basis is set forth in the attached tables. It is designed to bring
corporations to a full current tax payment basis in the spring of 1967--
three years earlier than under present law. The resulting non-recurring
gain in revenues is demonstrated in Table 1 where it is shown that the
acceleration will bring forward an additional 16 per cent of corporate
taxes in fiscal year 1966 and an additional 26 per cent in fiscal year
1967 as compared with 100. In other words, corporations will be paying
116 per cent of tax liabilities in 1966 and 126 per cent in 1967. As
compared with existing law, this new plan pulls forward an additional
6 per cent in fiscal year 1966 and an additional 16 per cent in fiscal
year 1967.
In terms of actual revenue, the new plan is estimated to pull
forward in April-June 1966, a total of $4.4 billion compared with
$3.3 billion estimated under existing law. In April-June 1967, the
new figure is estimated at $8.5 billion instead of $5.3 billion.
The new proposal does not alter existing regulations relating
to taxes exempt from acceleration. These include among other provisions
(1) the first $100,000 of tax liability and/or (2) 30 per cent of total
liability. Thus, even at completion in the spring of 1967 of the move
to a full pay-as-you-go basis, corporations will still have left to
pay in March and June of the year following the accrual of liability
roughly 42 per cent of their total liability for the preceding year.
This is shown for 1968 in the next to last column of the middle tier
of Table 2. After paying during 1967 58.4 per cent of estimated 1967
liabilities, corporations in the following March 1968--when they will
file the final return for calendar year 1967--are scheduled to pay
half of the remaining tax due, with the remaining half to be paid
in June, the table shows that such 1967 taxes paid in 1968 will come
to 41.6 per cent of total 1967 liabilities.
The bottom tier of Table 2 shows the heavy concentration of
tax payments in the April--June quarter which will result from this
speed-up plan.

APPENDIX B: CORPORATE FINANCING IN 1965*
The article on "Financing Corporate Investment" which
appeared in the December issue of the Bulletin was based in large part
on preliminary Flow-of-Funds statistics through the third quarter of
last year. Similar estimates, which take account of revisions in
relevant components of GNP, firmer statistics for the third quarter,
and preliminary data for the fourth quarter, are now available for the
full year 1965 and are shown in the attached table. These estimates
will appear in the Economic Report of the President in a table that
replaces the usual Department of Commerce estimates of corporate sources
and uses of funds, which have been discontinued.
As may be seen from the table, internal funds are currently
estimated to have been $6 billion larger and capital expenditures over
$9 billion larger than in 1964. This development, together with increases
in other uses of funds, was reflected in a large increase in the volume
of funds obtained in credit and capital markets. Borrowing at commercial
banks accounted for most of the increase in such external financing.
Thus the new data do not change the general conclusions presented in
the Bulletin article.
There are also attached updated versions of two of the charts
that appeared in the Bulletin article. As Chart 1 shows, financing in
credit and capital markets continued through the fourth quarter to
represent an unusually large proportion of total corporate funds
obtained from all sources (other than open-book trade credit). However,
availability of estimates for each of the quarters of last year
changes somewhat our previous impressions of trends during the year.
Security market financing, which had increased both in dollar volume and
relative to total funds in each of the first three quarters, declined
in the fourth quarter while expansion in bank loans, which had moderated
in the third quarter, accelerated again in the fourth quarter.
The 1965 figures plotted in Chart 2 not only show a continued
rise in both capital outlays and internal funds from the third to the
fourth quarter but also indicate that for the year as a whole capital
outlays were larger relative to internal funds than had been apparent
previously. The latter change reflects primarily the recent Department
of Commerce upward revisions in nonresidential business fixed invest-
ment and downward revisions in undistributed corporate profits.
Though financing activities of corporations and changes in their
overall financial position reflect all the uses to which corporations
put funds and all the sources they tap, it is convenient.

Section, Division of Research and Statistics.

and often revealing to focus the analysis on selected major uses and
their relation to selected major sources. The approach used in the
Bulletin article, of appraising the growth in corporate borrowing last
year in terms of the course of capital outlays vs. internal funds, is
just one of several ways of summarizing corporate investment and fin-
ancing. Another approach is to compare borrowing with that part of
capital outlays not covered by capital consumption allowances. Using
this approach makes the increase in credit and capital market financing
last year seem not very striking; "net" capital outlays rose 43 per
cent and credit and capital market financing 50 per cent. Or, expressed
another way, such financing represented about 81 per cent of "net" out-
lays in 1963 and 1964 and 85 per cent in 1965. Thus, the volume of
borrowing last year, while substantial, was only moderately larger than
might have been expected given the sharp rise in corporate investment
in physical assets.
