SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK
Outlook for GNP
It now appears that the increase in GNP for the first quarter
will be somewhat smaller than the $16 billion fourth quarter rise.
A temporary slowing of the rise in consumption as the new Social
Security taxes took effect and some reduction in inventory accumulation
from the high fourth quarter rate seem to be chiefly responsible.
Looking ahead, we would expect the second quarter to show another large
GNP gain, perhaps on the order of the current quarter's increase.
The latest survey of business plans for spending on new plant
and equipment has confirmed earlier estimates of sharp further advances
in the first and second quarters and on throughout the year. Moreover,
new orders for defense products and total military purchases of goods
and services appear to be moving up rapidly, although some slowing is
possible in the spring. But in the second quarter consumption should
be rising somewhat more rapidly in view of the continuing stimulus to
income from higher business investment and defense outlays.
Business inventory accumulation is expected to continue
relatively large in the spring, possibly at or somewhat above the first
quarter rate. The figure for January indicates a considerable slowing
from the very high December rise, and manufacturers report anticipations
of a first quarter increase only about three-fifths as large as during
the fourth quarter. But this information provides a very incomplete
basis for drawing an inference about the quarter as a whole. Pressures

I -2
for expanding inventories in defense and business equipment industries
remain strong. And manufacturers generally anticipate a pick-up in
inventory accumulation during the second quarter.
Prices and costs
Rapid expansion in employment and production continued through
the first two months of this year, and the unemployment rate declined
further to 3.7 per cent in February, breaking through the lowest point
reached in the boom of the mid-1950's. At the same time, operations
in manufacturing industries have edged up above 92 per cent of capacity.
Business expectations for intensified supply problems were already
evident in the fourth quarter and have been reinforced by the high rate
of new orders for business and defense equipment and now by the Commerce-
SEC survey.
The behavior of the industrial price index thus far this year,
however, has not differed greatly from that of last year; through the
first quarter, the annual rate of increase apparently has remained at
about 1.5 per cent. But increases have begun to appear in some commodity
groups that had been relatively stable -- such as industrial chemicals,
paper, and nonmetallic minerals -- and steel prices have been edging up.
None of this yet suggests comparison with the breakout of prices in
the summer of 1955, much less with the eruption after the Korean outbreak
in the summer of 1950.
One reason for the limited price response to date is that
unit labor costs have shown relatively little rise. In contrast with

I- 3
the upturns in late 1955 and late 1950, labor costs per unit of manu-
facturing output are little higher than a year ago or two years ago,
even including the January 1 increase in social security taxes. But
with some further slowing in productivity gains as pressures on manpower
and plant resources mount, unit labor cost increases may become more
pervasive.
On the other hand, the food price situation may be on the
verge of reversal. In wholesale markets, prices of foodstuffs rose
10 per cent over the 12 months to February, accounting for nearly three-
fourths of the rise in the total wholesale index. Some weather damage
to crops of fruits and vegetables raised prices in January, but the main
cause of the rise over the year was a reduction in meat supplies. The
first quarter of this year is likely to see the low of per capita meat
supplies, and through the balance of the year seasonal and cyclical
forces in livestock markets will combine to yield a sizable increase
in production. In early March, hog prices fell sharply and the average
for livestock declined moderately despite further increases in cattle.
Bank loans and deposits
Continued high business spending and low corporate liquidity
are expected to sustain a large business loan demand in coming months,
even though the recent prime loan rate increase might divert some of
the demand into capital markets. In this situation, banks may be
required to make even larger portfolio adjustments than earlier this
year. At large banks, Treasury holdings are already at low levels,

I -4
so that increased liquidation of municipal securities may develop.
Further, some reduction in acquisitions of mortgage loans may also
materialize this spring.
Such portfolio adjustments are likely to be necessary in
part because of continued difficulties in securing deposit inflows.
Demand deposits may show further growth in coming weeks, due in part to
heavy March and April tax period credit demands. But time and savings
deposit inflows are not likely to pick up much from the reduced pace
since year-end, despite the recent rise in posted rates on CDs. Indeed,
with record near-term CD maturities, the larger banks may count them-
selves fortunate merely to replace CD run-offs this month and next.
This roll-over problem may be extended into coming months,
since corporate buyers appear interested principally in short maturities
because of the thinness of the secondary market and corporate liquidity
needs. But banks for their part may be more anxious to attract longer-
term funds, if necessary at rates approaching or equal to the Regulation
Q ceiling. This week two large banks were reported to be securing funds
at 5-1/2 per cent rates posted for CDs maturing in 1967.
Capital market outlook
With both bond yields and the spread between bond and stock
yields at their highest levels in many years, investors recently appear
to have become somewhat more willing buyers of bonds. At the same time

1-5
a number of borrowers have elected to postpone or scale-down the size
of their scheduled bond offerings.
These factors have contributed to the recent pause in the
upward course of corporate yields and to declines in yields on municipal
and Government bonds. The Government bond market has been technically
strong as dealers have sought to cover sizable net short positions.
Meanwhile, in corporate and municipal markets underwriters have attempted
to reduce their inventories to a minimum, with the result that any
pick-up in investor demand for bonds has tended to be quickly reflected
in prices.
Looking beyond the immediate technical strength of bond markets,
prospective strong business demands for capital market financing are
likely to maintain upward pressure on bond yields as spring progresses.
A few postponements of privately placed corporate issues have been
reported, but business demands for funds are generally too pressing to
be postponed. And the recent advance in the prime loan rate at banks
will probably increase the share of business financing undertaken in the
security markets.
In the municipal bond market the March calendar of new
offerings has been unusually large, despite the number of recent post-
ponements. In April, however, new offerings of municipals are expected
to drop to a lower level. The strengthening market influence of such
a decline could be more than offset, though, if commercial banks accelerate
their efforts to cut back on holdings of municipals.

I-7
Balance of payments
Thus far this year the balance of payments on the liquidity
basis has been in deficit, but on a significantly smaller scale than
in the fourth quarter of 1965. The deficit on a quarterly basis, with
certain adjustments, appears to have been in the $100 million to $300
million range, as compared with about $400 million in the fourth quarter
last year. The comparison makes allowance for the postponements of
Canadian security issues into early 1966, Canadian official repurchases
of Canadian securities from U.S. holders this year, the omission of
U.K. debt service paymentsat the year-end, and for seasonal tendencies.
Most factors, however, seem to point toward a growing rather
than a diminishing deficit in the period ahead. Most importantly,
a recent reexamination of import trends, assuming a higher GNP pro-
jection of $735 billion for the year, has led an interagency group to
project 1966 imports at $25 billion, up 16 per cent from 1965. With
a projected rise of 12 per cent in merchandise exports, the 1966 trade
surplus is now projected by this group at $4.5 billion, compared with
$4.8 billion in 1965 and $6.7 billion in 1964. Net exports of goods
and services, civilian and military, are projected at $6.6 billion,
compared with $7.2 billion in 1965.
Another factor worsening this group's projection of 1966
payments prospects is a reestimate of direct investment outflows, now
put at $2.75 billion, net of Delaware subsidiaries' bond issue proceeds.

I-8
The Commerce Department's latest survey of plans for plant and equip-
ment expenditures abroad by U.S. corporations' subsidiaries and branches
indicates a 24 per cent rise in fixed capital outlays from 1965 to 1966.
Investment on the scale indicated will require substantial increases
in net borrowing abroad, of conventional sorts as well as through the
new device of dollar-denominated convertible bonds, if the goals of
the voluntary program laid out by the Department of Commerce are to be
met.
Taking these factors into account, the group considered it
possible that the balance of payments deficit on the liquidity basis
could substantially exceed $2 billion this year, as against $1.3 billion
in 1965. However, in evaluating the prospects, the potential impact
of restrictive credit conditions in the United States may not have
been fully allowed for. Tighter credit conditions should restrain bank
credit outflows -- although probably not to the extent of January, when
the reflux of bank loans and acceptance credits was $100 million larger
than seasonal, in part because of other factors. More restrictive
credit conditions here may also result in further repatriations of
nonbank liquid funds and in additional borrowings abroad to finance
direct-investment operations.

THE ECONOMIC PICTURE IN DETAIL
The Nonfinancial Scene
Gross National Product. Expansion in economic activity is
continuing, but the increase in gross national product in the current
quarter, and also in the next quarter, now appears likely to fall
short of matching the sharp rise in the final quarter of last year.
Our present projection of GNP of $711 billion, seasonally adjusted
annual rate in the first quarter reflects two months of underlying data
for some major expenditure sectors, but only one month's figures for
two particularly critical sectors -- government purchases of goods
and services and change in business inventories. We are tentatively
projecting a GNP of $724 billion for the second quarter.
Our present projection for the first quarter is $2 billion
less than the projection presented here three weeks ago. The very high
rate of nonfarm business inventory accumulation in the fourth quarter
apparently is not being maintained in the current quarter. In January
the annual rate of increase in book value of nonfarm business inven-
tories was $7.2 billion, as compared with a rise of $11.5 billion in
the fourth quarter. Assuming the January figure will be revised up
later and that February and March will remain high, we are showing
the projected change in nonfarm inventories at $8.0 billion down
from the published figure of $8.9 billion in the fourth quarter. In
addition to this revision, net exports of goods and services are now

II -2
projected $.5 billion less than before, because of a somewhat greater
increase in imports than assumed then; State and local government
purchases are projected at a rate nearly $.5 billion less than
earlier because Federal grants-in-aid have been smaller than was
indicated in the January Federal Budget; and the projected rise in
Federal government nondefense purchases is less because of a smaller
rise in net CCC outlays for farm commodities, in part due to large
sales of CCC-held corn.
Our earlier projections of national defense outlays, fixed
private investment, and personal consumption expenditures are consistent
with currently available data. However, consumer outlays for durable
goods now appear a little stronger and spending for nondurable goods
a little weaker. The new plant and equipment spending survey shows an
increase in the first quarter similar to that in our projections.
The projected increases of nearly $14 billion in the first
quarter and $13 billion in the second are somewhat less than the $15.7
billion now published for the fourth quarter. Nevertheless, the under-
lying strength of economic expansion is virtually undiminished. Rapidly
increasing defense purchases of goods and services in support of our
efforts in Vietnam and outlays for business fixed investment, as noted
before, provide the major stimulant for rising incomes.
Reflecting higher personal incomes consumption expenditures
are projected to rise substantially. The smaller increase in the first
quarter than in the fourth quarter, still projected at $7.3 billion

II -3
(annual rate) in contrast to the $8.5 billion actual gain in the fourth
quarter, apparently reflects the marked step-up ($2.9 billion annual
rate) in social insurance contributions which became effective the
beginning of the year.
For the second quarter the increases now projected for major
demand sectors are virtually the same as in our previous projection.
Business fixed investment in the second quarter is projected in line
with the increase shown by the recent Commerce-SEC survey. Nonfarm
businesses are assumed to increase inventories at the same rate as
in the first quarter, thus maintaining stability in the stock-sales
ratio. Residential construction activity as projected is down a trifle
from the first quarter, reflecting the substantial dropback in housing
starts in January. And personal consumption expenditures are projected
to rise a little more than in the first quarter.
According to the Bureau of the Budget projections, the
increase in defense purchases of goods and services will be considerably
smaller in the second quarter than in the current one, $1.2 billion in
contrast to $2.5 billion. However, it now appears possible that the
second quarter increase may be a little larger than indicated by the
Budget projections and shown in our table.
A GNP in the second quarter of $724 billion as projected would
imply an increase in real output in the quarter to a level more than
6 per cent above a year earlier.

Industrial production. Industrial production advanced fur-
ther in February to 151.3 per cent, 0.8 per cent above January, which
was revised up to 150.1, and 9 per cent above a year earlier. Output
of both final products and materials continued to rise.
Production of most types of business equipment reached new
highs, output of defense equipment rose further, and output of consumer
goods as a whole increased. Apparel production recovered from the
curtailed level in January brought about by the New York transit
strike. Output of some household goods and consumer staples advanced
further. Auto assemblies declined slightly, due to a strike at Chrysler
and production curtailments by American Motors, and were at an annual
rate of 9.1 million units. Production schedules for March are set at
an annual rate of about 9.5 million. Output of color television ex-
panded further in February but that of black and while sets declined.
Iron and steel production increased again. Production of
most other durable materials rose further and output of nondurable
materials changed little from the advanced December-January level.
In early March, steel ingot output continued to advance, and trade
papers report estimates of steel output for the year around last
year's record total.
Personal income. Personal income in February advanced sub-
stantially to a further seasonally adjusted annual rate of $556 billion,
a level 8 per cent higher than a year earlier. As in most recent months,

II -6
increases in wages and salaries accounted for most of the rise, with
gains in manufacturing payrolls contributing significantly to the rise.
Other types of personal income edged up in line with trends over recent
months, or were unchanged.
Since last September, wage and salary disbursements in manu-
facturing have risen at an average annual rate of more than 12 per cent.
Government payrolls have also increased at about that rate partly
reflecting the Federal pay raise. Substantial increases have also
been registered by farm proprietors' income and by "regular" transfer
payments.
Retail sales. Retail sales have exhibited a marked change
in pace recently. Following a sharp run-up in late 1965 (4.3 per cent
from September to December), sales declined slightly in January and
were about unchanged in February. The January and February figures
are both preliminary and the chances are they will be revised upward,
so that the contrast between late 1965 and early 1966 may not be so
striking as it now appears.
According to presently available figures, sales of durable
goods stores have edged down slightly since December in large part
because of somewhat lower sales by auto dealers. Sales of furniture
and appliance stores have been maintained. Sales of nondurable goods
stores, following a slight dip in January, returned in February to the
advanced December level. Food stores sales, which are reported to have risen

II -7
7 per cent and accounted for two-thirds of the increase for total nondurable
goods between last September and December, declined slightly from
December to February. On the other hand, sales of general merchandise
stores increased further in early 1966.
Average retail sales in January and February were about un-
changed from their fourth quarter average, while personal income was
up 1.5 per cent.
Consumer credit. Consumers borrowed rather heavily in January
to purchase appliances, furniture, television sets, and other household
goods. The net increase in this type of instalment debt was the largest
in several months. Consumers also increased their cash borrowing to
finance other personal needs. Here too, the rise in outstanding
balances was the largest in a number of months.
However, less credit than usual was used in buying autos.
The increase in auto credit balances -- $236 million -- was sharply
less than in December and less than in any month last year. New car
sales were up in January and this might ordinarily have engendered
a continued high level of credit extensions. But used car sales were off
and provided something of an offset.
Moreover, while the evidence is fragmentary, it appears that
auto terms have become a little tighter. The proportion of "liberal"
contracts -- those with the lowest downpayments and longest maturities --
turned down in January, the average car note was smaller, and the pro-
portion of cars bought on credit declined.

II -8
With auto credit slowing down, the growth in total instalment
credit in January was held to $622 million or $7.4 billion seasonally
adjusted annual rate. The rate for the fourth quarter of last year was
$7.6 billion and for all of 1965 it was $7.8 billion.
Construction activity. Seasonally adjusted new construction
expenditures edged higher in February from the already advanced rate
reached at the turn of the year. In the private sector, residential
expenditures moved closer to their peak in early 1964 while -- with
the boom in business capital investment continuing -- nonresidential
construction expenditures apparently touched another new high. Public
construction dipped somewhat in February and remained below its recent
peak in November.
Reflecting in part increased labor costs, the year-to-year
advance in February was 8 per cent; in 1957-59 dollars the rise was
only half that.

Plant and equipment. Substantial further increases in business
spending for new plant and equipment are now planned for this year,
according to the survey conducted in late January and February by
Commerce-SEC. Fixed capital outlays now planned for 1966 as a whole
total $60.2 billion, 15.9 per cent more than last year's record.
At this time last year businesses planned an 11.7 per cent
increase in plant and equipment expenditures for 1965. Actual outlays
turned out to be 4 percentage points higher. Outlays anticipated in
early 1964 also understated the actual rise of that year by 4 percentage
points. Reflecting the influence of overstatements in some earlier
years, the average understatement of the rise over the last six years
has been only 1 percentage point.
Plant and equipment outlays of all major industries are in-
dicated to be up this year by the Commerce-SEC survey and for both
manufacturing and nonmanufacturing as a whole the increases are strikingly
similar to those last year, Within manufacturing, this year's relative
increase is considerably smaller than last year's for chemicals,
motor vehicles and parts, primary metals, and nonelectrical machinery.
Relative increases larger than last year are indicated for textiles,
paper, and transportation equipment other than motor vehicles.

The survey indicates that business outlays for new plant and
equipment apparently will continue to rise throughout the year, as
increases are now anticipated in the second half by most of the major
industries. Exceptions are indicated for producers of electrical
machinery and equipment and petroleum and by the nonrail transportation
industry. A pattern of expenditures rising throughout the year is sup-
ported for manufacturers as a whole by the very large increase in back-
logs of uncompleted capital projects in the fourth quarter of 1965. The
recent National Industrial Conference Board survey of fourth quarter
capital appropriations of the 1,000 largest manufacturers showed such
backlogs to be at an all-time high.I I I

II -11
Manufacturers reported to Commerce-SEC a carry-over of
plant and equipment projects at the end of 1965 (unexpended funds
on projects already underway) a third larger than a year earlier; the
carry-over for public utilities was two-fifths larger.
All major manufacturing industries expect higher sales this
year than last -- durable goods producers, 8.5 per cent, and nondurable
goods producers, 7 per cent. These are both slightly smaller gains than
were actually realized last year. Retailers anticipate a sales gain of
8 per cent, the same as in 1965.
Business inventories. After accelerating sharply in the late
months of 1965, business inventory accumulation slackened in January.
The book value of manufacturers' and distributors' inventories in-
creased $600 million in January, as compared with a near-record
$1,350 million in December and a fourth quarter monthly average of
$960 million. January figures, however, are preliminary and subject
to revision; preliminary figures for other recent months have been
revised appreciably upward, as shown in the table. The January decline
in inventory accumulation is hard to reconcile with increased production
and little change in trade.
The slowing in January occurred for both manufacturers and
distributors but was more striking at distributors: the January book
value increase for manufacturers was about two-thirds of the fourth
quarter rate while that for distributors was only about one-half.

II -12
Distributors' inventories increased nearly $200 million in
January, and the increase was centered in durable goods, where in-
ventories had increased only moderately in the fourth quarter. Retail
(and wholesale) stocks of nondurable goods were unchanged in January
after a sharp run-up in the fourth quarter. Half the fourth quarter
rise at retail outlets for nondurable goods had been at food stores
and in January food stocks edged off somewhat. Inventories at other
nondurable goods stores also declined except for general merchandise
stores, where stocks showed a large further increase.
Manufacturers' inventories increased about $400 million in
January, with half in durable goods and half in nondurable goods. As
in other recent months a major part of the durable increase was in
work-in-process stocks in business equipment and defense industries.
Also work-in-process stocks rose appreciably in the steel industry.
Liquidation of consumers' steel stocks continued in January although
at not so fast a pace as in late 1965.

Inventory anticipation. According to the latest Commerce
quarterly survey, conducted in February, manufacturers anticipate an
inventory book value increase of $1 billion in the first quarter and
an increase of $1.3 billion in the second quarter. The fourth quarter
increase totaled $1,750 million. In the last half of 1965, actual
inventory accumulation far exceeded manufacturers' anticipations.
However, the first quarter 1966 started off with a book value in-
crease in January more or less in line with anticipations for the
quarter.
Labor market. With unemployment declining to 3.7 per cent
in February -- the lowest rate in almost 13 years -- all major manpower
series now indicate labor market conditions at their tightest since the
Korean conflict. In February, nonfarm employers continued to add workers
to their payrolls in large numbers; the average workweek in manufacturing
rose further to a new postwar high; the voluntary quit rate advanced; and
the number of economic part-time workers was the lowest on record.
Gains in nonfarm establishment employment of 250,000 in
February was about the same as in the previous month with increases
fairly widespread among industries. Demand was particularly strong
in manufacturing where employment increased faster in February than
in the previous month and accounted for half of the gain in all nonfarm
jobs. In part, the sharper rise in February was due to a catch-up in
apparel employment following the transit strike in New York City. The

II -14
metal using and producing industries also continued to rise sharply
especially electrical equipment, machinery and aircraft.
In nonmanufacturing industries, trade, services and govern-
ment each added about 50,000 employees. Construction declined slightly
from the high December-January levels. Federal government employment
has maintained a steady upward trend in recent months and in February
was about 100,000 above a year ago; earlier in the expansion it had
been stable. The armed forces added about 35,000 men in February
and at 2,924,000, were 230,000 larger than when the military build-up
began in August. Present plans call for a total strength of about
3.1 million, which should be reached in early summer at the present
rate of increase.

II -15
Average gains in nonfarm employment in the past 2 months
have been somewhat smaller than the extremely large increases reported
at year-end, However, at an annual rate of over 3 million, the January-
February rise was still substantially greater than the monthly average
increase for 1965 and well above the increase implied in the staff
projection for the current year.
The slower rate of increase is mostly due to a slight decline
in construction employment following a very sharp run-up at yearend.
In other industries there has been a small reduction in the rate of
increase. In some industries this may reflect the unavailability of
skilled and experienced workers; in others, it may result from some
slowdown following a period of unusually large and possibly anticipatory
hiring. The expansion of an already long workweek in almost all manu-
facturing industries, however, provides little evidence of manpower
hoarding.

II -16
Average hours in manufacturing again rose in February to a
new postwar high of 41,6 hours, continuing the steady up-trend since
last October. The current workweek is more than a half hour longer
than during the Korean period in both durable and nondurable goods
industries. Overtime also edged up further in February to 4.1 hours,
a half hour above last year and the highest since the data have been
published.
Unemployment. The decline in February marked the sixth
consecutive month that unemployment has fallen. At 3.7 per cent, the
rate was almost a full percentage point below late summer 1965 -- a
decline about equal to the entire reduction in unemployment over the
two preceding years. The most recent decline occurred mainly among
women and teenagers continuing the trend of recent months. The teen-
age rate fell by nearly one percentage point in February to below 11
per cent, finally returning to the levels achieved in 1957. The jobless
rate of adult men, which had been declining rapidly, continued stable
for the third month (at 2.3 per cent) and blue-collar unemployment
continued to drift downward. Secondary workers have improved their
unemployment position relative to primary workers, and the composition
of unemployment rates is moving toward the less divergent pattern of
the Korean period. This would seem to indicate experienced unemployed
manpower is close to a frictional rate and a more equitable demographic
matching of supplies and demands is taking place,

II -17
The nonwhite unemployment rate which had also been falling,
failed to share in the latest decline in total unemployment. Conse-
quently the differential between white and nonwhite workers widened
in February. Nevertheless, at 7.0 per cent, the nonwhite unemployment
rate was at its lowest point since this series was started in 1954.
Earnings and labor costs. Hourly earnings in manufacturing,
seasonally adjusted, rose further in February to $2.67 per hour but
showed little sign of acceleration over the steady moderate gains
of recent months. This relative stability in wage gains may partly
reflect the offsetting effects of wage increases and expanding
employment. New workers tend to be hired at comparatively low entry
wages -- this is particularly true of young workers and women whose
employment in manufacturing has been increasing rapidly. Thus, the
effect of the increase in low entry wage would tend to pull down
somewhat the average wage of all factory workers. The fact that
average wages have resisted this downward pressure implies that there
probably has been an offsetting rise in the wage rates of experienced
workers. However, the major factor in the relative stability of wage
increases continues to be the limited number of new contracts open
for renegotiation.
Unit labor costs in January rose by nearly one percentage
point; but this was a one-time effect due to a rise in the level of
Social Security taxes. Even at this level unit costs were slightly

II -18
higher than in 1965. Output per manhour in manufacturing has shown
sharp variations in recent months in part due to steel inventory
liquidation and it has been difficult to determine the current trend
with complete confidence. Over the past three months, however, output
per manhour averaged around 2.8 per cent above the same months last
year, a rise below the 3.6 per cent for 1965. If the lower rate
continues, moderate upward pressure on unit labor costs will follow.
For February, with increases in hourly earnings small but with
productivity gains reduced, unit labor costs show a further rise.
Wholesale prices. The industrial commodity price index is
estimated to have edged up about .2 per cent further into mid-March
from the mid-January level of 103.0 per cent of the 1957-59 average.
The index is about 1.6 per cent above both the level of a year ago
and also the cyclical high reached early in 1960. Average prices of
foodstuffs have changed little since mid-February, after rising sharply
and accounting for much of the rise in the total wholesale price index
over the previous year. The total wholesale price index in mid-March
is little changed from a month ago, but roughly .5 per cent above
the mid-January level.
Although the BLS weekly estimates of the industrial index
have shown little change since January, evidence from numerous other
sources suggests continuation of the moderate upward price trend
characteristic of the previous 16 months. While the rise in non-
ferrous metals -- a major contributor to the industrial increase

II -19
last year -- has slowed markedly, price increases have been appearing
recently for commodities relatively stable previously and not included
in the BLS weekly estimates. West Coast newsprint producers advanced
prices $10 to $134 a ton -- a price which was in effect from 1957 to
late 1964. East Coast producers announced advances ranging from $5
to $10 a ton. Tire manufacturers raised prices of replacement tires
by up to 3 per cent, citing labor costs and also rubber prices which
have edged up slightly from the low of late 1965. Chemical producers
have announced substantial price increases among organic chemicals which
have recently averaged about 12 per cent below the 1957-59 level.
Prices of hides, now about 80 per cent above a year ago,
and leather have risen further this year primarily because of sharply
rising export demand. Argentina, the world's largest supplier, has
exported almost no hides so far this year because of an extended
and widespread drought. The Commerce Department, as a consequence,
has imposed export quotas on hides such that estimated domestic
consumption in 1966 will be fully met by domestic supplies,
The copper situation, according to observers, is expected
to tighten further as the "setasides" -- the fraction of capacity
immediately usuable for priority Government orders -- are increasingly
used for defense orders. Copper scrap prices have continued to rise
to new highs, and as one result, producers of brass and bronze ingot
have discontinued price quotes, and have tied the product price to
the scrap price.

II -20
Substantial steel price adjustments -- both upward and
downward -- have been taking place, and estimates indicate a small
net rise in the index for steel mill products. To meet import
competition, one producer has announced the discontinuing of price
lists and the consequent selling on a negotiated basis.
Average prices of livestock, at the February high over a
third above a year ago, declined about 3 per cent. Hog prices fell
sharply by around 17 per cent, while beef cattle prices rose moderately
further.
Consumer prices. The consumer price index was unchanged
from mid-December to mid-January at 111.0 per cent of the 1957-59
average, 1.9 per cent above a year ago. Contributing to the stability
were the reductions in excise taxes -- from 10 per cent to 3 per cent
for telephone services, and from 7 per cent to 6 per cent for autos.
Both taxes have been restored and this will affect the April index.
Foods increased .7 per cent further from December to
January as meats rose 2.9 per cent, with pork showing a 6.5 per cent
rise. Since mid-February, however, hog prices in wholesale markets
have begun a decline from advanced levels, and consequently, some
fall in retail pork prices is now expected. Price increases among
fresh vegetables, which resulted from adverse weather in growing areas,
also contributed to the January rise in foods.

II -21
Nonfood commodities decreased .4 per cent mainly as a result
of seasonal declines in apparel and new cars, the excise tax reduction,
and also a further drop in used cars.
Services rose .2 per cent despite the effect of the tax
reduction on telephone rates. Except for the tax cut, the average
for services would have increased about .5 per cent. Medical care rose
.5 per cent, and transportation services, reflecting a rise in auto-
mobile insurance, rose 1 per cent.

Protein food prospects. The annual census of livestock on
farms which is taken each January 1 is a revealing indicator of the
quantities of high-protein foods likely to be produced during the year.
A weighted index of the livestock count this January 1 showed livestock
numbers down 1 per cent from a year earlier. The value of the inven-
tory was up 22 per cent to $17.5 billion. Numbers of milk cows and
hogs were down the most from a year earlier with cows down 6 per cent
and hogs down 4 per cent to the lowest figure since 1955. There also
were fewer chickens, particularly egg-type pullets, (broilers were
not counted) and fewer sheep. Turkey numbers were up 9 per cent.
Contrary to expectations of many analysts, the beef cattle herd was
1 per cent larger than a year earlier.

Department of Agriculture forecasts of 1966 production of
high-protein foods made before the livestock census data became
available projected output of beef, poultry meat, and eggs for 1966
as a whole moderately above 1965 and output of pork, veal, lamb, and
milk below 1965. The livestock inventory data generally support these
projections and suggest that, barring severe drought, production sights
might be lifted a little for the second half of the year. Of course
we will know far more about farmers' production plans for the second
half of the year when new pig crop information becomes available on
March 22 and the number of cattle on feed is reported on April 15.
A commodity by commodity examination of seasonal and cyclical
influences affecting the flow of production by quarters throughout 1966
suggests that we are now experiencing the tightest supply of these
foods of the year, with per capita supplies about 4 per cent smaller
than a year earlier. Per capita supplies are likely to begin to rise
in the second quarter, and to continue to rise to a level 4 per cent
or more above a year earlier in the fourth quarter.
Production of beef is expected to be up enough to provide
per capita supplies throughout 1966 equal to the high levels of 1964
and 1965. Fed beef will probably make up a somewhat larger proportion
of the total supply than in 1965. Pork supplies are expected to in-
crease beginning in May or June when pigs from the larger November-May
pig crop begin to reach market.

II -24
Apparently, the trough in the 4-year cycle in hog numbers
was reached in the last quarter of 1965 and the first quarter of 1966,
with pork production from October through February down about a fifth
from year earlier levels. Substantial withholding of marketable hogs
to add to breeding stock apparently contributed to these short supplies.
This suggests that the turn-around in farrowings that began in November
may proceed more rapidly than the planned 7 per cent increases in the
spring crop (November-May) reported by hog producers surveyed in
December.
Supplies of eggs are already easing as production moves toward
the seasonal production peak in April. The buildup of the laying flock
as indicated by hatchings of egg-type chickens is expected to boost
production in the second half of 1966. Broiler production increased
throughout 1965 and at the end of the year was at a level 12 per cent
above a year earlier. Substantially larger hatching egg supply flocks
this year will support further expansion of broiler output. A record
turkey crop 10 per cent above the crop of 1965 is expected.
The USDA is currently projecting milk production in 1966 at
2 per cent below 1965 with production rising above a year earlier in the
second half. Any short-fall in supplies will occur in milk used for
manufacturing, probably in nonfat dry milk and butter, since milk
tends to flow to its highest valued use, the fluid milk market.

II -25
Purchases of manufactured dairy products by the CCC will probably be
less than in 1965 when such purchases were equivalent to 5 per cent
of total milk production. Consequently, domestic donations and P.L.
480 shipments abroad will probably be reduced somewhat.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL SITUATION
Bank credit. In early March, total bank credit appeared to
be continuing to expand at the modest February rate. In line with sus-
tained demands to finance inventories and capital outlays, business
loans at city banks remained strong early in the month. But in meeting
strong loan demands city banks have had to reduce their investment
portfolios further. After rough allowance for seasonal movements,
holdings of Treasury securities at weekly reporting banks recently have
been declining about as rapidly as in February. These banks also have
been reducing their holdings of other securities -- mainly municipals --
contraseasonally.
Credit demands on banks at midmonth are expected to be quite
strong as businesses increase their borrowing for tax and dividend
purposes. Tax payments, estimated at $6.7 billion, may be no larger
than last year, but outstanding tax anticipation bills due this month
are $500 million larger than a year ago. Nonetheless, demands for bank
loans may be greater because of reduced corporate liquidity.
One indication of the recent tightness at larger banks is
their limited acquisitions of Export-Import Bank participation certifi-
cates issued late last month. Although the issue had certain technical
disadvantages, it was attractively priced to yield 5-1/2 per cent, yet
banks took only about half of the $700 million offered. Moreover,
New York banks, which took about $200 million of the issue, evidently

III -2
served principally an underwriting function -- selling most of these
certificates within a very few days.
Another more important indication of tightness was the increase
in the prime rate to 5-1/2 per cent at banks throughout the country
late last week. Business loan demands have remained strong since the
December System policy actions, and banks generally expect continued
strength in such demands. Reports suggest that the earlier December
prime rate increase was not sufficient to significantly deter business
loan expansion, due in part to the sharp run-up of yields in the
corporate bond market. Yields on Aaa corporate new issues rose above
the prime rate last month.
Bank deposits. In deciding to raise the prime rate, another
important factor that banks may have considered was the record near-
term maturities of negotiable CDs -- $4.1 billion this month and over
$3 billion in April. Although accustomed to CD run-offs at tax dates,
this time banks face problems of greater than usual magnitude. In
March and April, they must roll-over more than $7 billion of CDs in a
market in which corporate liquidity is reduced, credit demands are
large, and accelerated tax payments are due in mid-April. It is also
a market in which secondary trading in CDs has been made increasingly
difficult because CDs are available from banks with maturities as low
as 30 days.

III -3
These factors have already led to some increases in CD
offering rates; early this week at least two New York banks were
reported to be paying 5-1/2 per cent for CDs due in 1967. A prime
rate increase makes such actions more palatable, but increased CD
rates would have been likely even without an increase in the prime rate --
not so much to increase outstandings as to counter CD run-offs.
Large CD maturities were an important factor in the modest
growth in the seasonally adjusted total of time and savings deposits
at all commercial banks in early March. But savings deposits at weekly
reporting banks also continued to grow slowly, while time deposits other
than CDs rose more rapidly than last year. Country banks, however,
apparently are still showing more rapid inflows of total time and
savings deposits than are the larger banks.
After declining in February, private demand deposits rose
somewhat early in March, in part because of a reduction in Treasury
balances to unusually low levels. It is estimated that the seasonally
adjusted money stock rose quite sharply at midmonth, however, to the
highest level of the year -- about 6 per cent greater than a year ago.
It is likely that the March average money stock will be substantially
above the February level. As a result, the annual rate of growth for
the first quarter will be at an annual rate of approximately 5.5 per
cent -- a rate of growth smaller than the 7.5 per cent of the final
quarter of 1965.

III -4
U.S. Government securities market. Yields declined in all
maturity sectors of the U.S. Government note and bond market during the
first half of March. Treasury bill rates fluctuated over a fairly
wide range in this period but were little changed on balance.

longer range outlook for bond yields, The main thrust of the rally has
come from dealer purchases to cover short positions against a backgroundm

III -5
of sharply declining stock prices and widespread discussions of the
desirability of tighter fiscal policy to contain inflationary pressures
in the economy. In this period there was no significant expansion in
investment demand for Treasury bonds, and indeed some net selling of
intermediate- and long-term bonds by commercial banks was reported.
The increase in the prime loan rate announced by several major banks
on March 10 appears to have been widely anticipated and had little
impact on Treasury bond prices.
A factor contributing to strength in the Treasury bond market
in the current week has been the excellent reception accorded the $410
million issue of FNMA participation certificates. Yields set on this
1 to 15 year serial issue display a "humped" pattern ranging from 5.40
per cent in 1967 to 5.50 per cent in 1969 through 1975 and then falling
to 5.25 per cent in 1981.
Treasury bill rates declined in the early part of March as
demands for bills by investors seeking liquidity and by the System
pressed against limited dealer trading positions. More recently, bill
rates have risen as net market demand has tapered off with the approach
of the March tax and dividend period. In addition, there has been
increased competition for bills from rising CD rates following the rise
in the prime loan rate. The increase in net borrowed reserve positions
in recent weeks also has contributed to some caution in the bill market.
In the regular weekly auction of March 14, the 3- and 6-month
bills were auctioned at new high average rates of 4.718 per cent and

III -6
4,915 per cent respectively. But yields declined rather sharply after
the auction as expected tax date pressures failed to materialize and
many buyers reportedly entered the market who had missed on their bids
in the auction.
Yields have continued to adjust higher recently on a variety
of other short-term debt instruments as is shown in the table:

Treasury finance. Current projections indicate that the Treasury
will not need to undertake any major financing operations before the
May refunding. It is expected, however, that the Treasury will continue

III -7
its $100 million additions to the weekly 3-month bill auctions at least
to the end of the current quarter. But the Treasury's cash operating
balance is still expected to decline to very low levels before mid-
April, and some cash borrowing in the market or directly from the System
on a temporary basis cannot be ruled out.
Mortgage markets. Pressures for higher yields on mortgage
loans continued to mount in March, reflecting heavy demands for credit
in other financial markets and reduced savings inflows to depository
institutions. In January, net expansion of total mortgage holdings
had apparently approached year-earlier levels. This was owing in part,
however, to a less than seasonal reduction in borrowings by savings and
loan associations and to a sharp further rise in mortgage holdings by
the Federal National Mortgage Association. In January, FNMA's purchases
from private lenders in the secondary market reached a record $229
million, nearly eight times the level a year earlier. And in February
they rose even further.
To check the strain on its resources in a period when its
own borrowing costs have been rising, FNMA in early March reduced prices
one percentage point more on most types of home mortgages it purchases
in the secondary market. This reduction -- equivalent to an increase of
about 12 basis points in yield to the mortgage holder -- marked the third
such upward adjustment in yields since early last December. At the same
time, under authority of the new "G.I." Act recently signed by the

III -8
President, the permitted maximum rate on VA-guaranteed home mortgages
was raised by a quarter point to 5-1/2 per cent, the same as the new
maximum announced for FHA-insured home mortgages a month earlier.
Trade reaction generally is that further upward adjustment may be required
to attract an adequate supply of funds to Government-underwritten
mortgages under the conditions now prevailing.
In January, secondary market yields on 5-1/4 per cent, 30-year,
FHA insured mortgages had advanced to 5.70 per cent. Related data for
February are not yet available. However, according to FHA, contract
rates on conventional first mortgages rose about 5 basis points further
in February -- to 6.05 per cent for loans on new homes and 6.10 per cent
for loans on existing homes. These were up 25 basis points from the
levels prevailing in mid-1965 and were the highest rates since early
1961.
In the case of conventional loans on new homes, some down-
ward adjustments in loan-to-value ratios and maturity terms were
reported for mortgages originated in January, according to the Federal
Home Loan Bank Board. In the case of existing home loans, however,
such terms were generally at or about their highs for the series.

Stock market. Common stock prices have continued to fall --
with only brief interruptions -- from their all-time high of early
February. Standard and Poor's composite index had declined about 7
per cent through March 15 to the lowest level since early September.
This compares with a drop of nearly 10 per cent in the market decline
of mid-1965. At its current level the index is more than 3 per cent
below the May peak reached just prior to that earlier correction.
Trading activity since early February has been heavy, with
the average daily volume exceeding 9 million shares. Moreover, trading
exceeded 10 million shares in four sessions and reached 11 million shares
on one day in early March. Earlier in this period, the most active
trading was associated with price declines but recently the continuing
sell-off has occurred on declining volume.
The price decline has been general, with the number of issues
registering weekly declines in the period outnumbering those showing

III -10
gains by a ratio of 2 to 1. About three fourths of the 82 industrial
groups making up the Standard and Poor's composite are below their
early February levels and 12 have registered 1965-66 lows. But low-
priced stocks, which have been recent speculative favorites, have
resisted the decline, advancing further to new highs for 1965-66.
This latter development suggests that small investors have become more
active buyers of stocks, a conclusion which is also supported by recent
statistics on odd lot transactions. Since early February, odd lot
purchases have exceeded sales by more than 300,000 shares per week,
whereas in the like period of 1965 they were about in balance.
In addition to the influence of rising interest rates and
credit restraint, investor concern that overheating of the economy may
lead to higher taxes, rising costs, and a squeeze on profit margins has
had abearish effect on the stock market. A strengthening influence,
however, is the more favorable level of price-earnings ratios that has
developed with recent price declines -- presently the average ratio to
(fourth quarter) earnings of the 500 companies included in the Standard
and Poor's index is 16.6, down from the 17.9 ratio prevailing at the
February high.

Corporate and municipal bond markets. Yields on State and
local government bonds, like those on long-term U.S. Treasury issues,
have turned down several basis points since early March, ending at
least temporarily six weeks of nearly continuous advance amounting to
1/4 of a percentage point. While yields on new issues of corporate
bonds -- after advancing more than 1/2 a percentage point over the same
six-week period -- have also shown some tendency to level off recently,
upward yield pressures have been maintained in this market by the weight
of the continuing heavy calendar of offerings. This latter influence
is also being reflected in the secondary market for corporate bonds.

With municipal bond yields in early March at or approaching
the highest levels reached in more than 30 years, a number of borrowers
decided to postpone all or part of planned offerings totaling nearly
$150 million. At the same time, the unusually favorable yields on new
issues and the sharp price concessions being offered by dealers on older
inventory elicited some pick-up in investor demand. A special factor
adding to such investor interest has been the development of a declining
stock market at a time when spreads between stock and bond yields are
the widest of the post-war period.
Municipal bond offerings are expected to total $1.1 billion
in March, despite recent postponements, but this includes $440 million
of New Jersey Turnpike Authority bonds, $334 million of which are for

III -13
refunding outstanding debt. Once the New Jersey Turnpike issue is out
of the way, the volume of new municipal offerings is expected to drop
off; in fact the total now estimated for April is the smallest for any
month this year. The lighter calendar ahead, a further cutback in
dealer's advertised inventories to around $400 million -- the lowest
level in more than two years, the favorable reception accorded last
week's large offering of public housing bonds, and the fact that
investors have undoubtedly already accumulated funds for the well
advertised turnpike issue have apparently all contributed to the recent
strength of the municipal market.
Looking further ahead, however, if commercial banks continue
to cut back their relative participation in municipal securities,
municipal bond yields are likely to be particularly vulnerable to any
further general advance of long-term interest rates. As yet, the spread
between yields on municipal and U.S. Treasury bonds has remained within
the range of wider margins that developed following the Regulation Q
action in early 1962. Hence with bank demand dropping off, this spread
relationship would be likely to narrow.

from preferred stock on a "rights" basis early in January. While some
holders of the preferred stock "rights" may have sold them to other
investors through the market, the volume of such transfers is not known.
In the corporate bond market, there appears to be little
prospect of any appreciable let up in the heavy volume of new issues.
Estimates of public offerings for April are not much below the indicated
total for March, which includes the March AT&T issue. And offerings
tentatively scheduled for May already exceed $400 million. A few post-
ponements have been reported in the private placement market -- apparently
representing borrowers with distant needs for funds who had been
hoping to anticipate these needs before interest rates adjusted higher.
But, more generally, corporate borrowers appear to have immediate and
pressing needs for long-term funds that cannot be postponed.

III -15
The continuing weight of any corporate bond offerings has
been reflected in a sharp widening of spreads between the yields
on new corporate issues and those on both corporate and long-term U.S.
Treasury bonds. It is interesting to note that the spreads between
yields on new and seasoned corporate issues is now approaching the high
range which prevailed during much of 1956 and 1957 -- a period in which
call protection was also being accorded a substantial premium.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
U.S. balance of payments. Preliminary data show a U.S.
payments surplus in February on the liquidity basis of slightly less
than $100 million, and approximate balance for January-February
together before seasonal adjustment. Assessment of first-quarter
payments developments is strongly affected by the seasonal adjustment
applied; on the basis given in the next paragraph there was apparently
some improvement early this year from the fourth quarter deficit of
$1-1/2 billion annual rate. The improvement appears sizeable if
adjustments are made for various special transactions. (These included
the postponement of Canadian security issues until the first quarter,
official Canadian transactions designed as partial offsets this year,
and the omission of the U.K. debt service payments last year.)
In each of the past three years, seasonal factors are
estimated to have benefited the U.S. payments position in the first
quarter as a whole by close to $0.5 billion, but within the quarter
the unadjusted results for January-February have been less favorable
than those for March, apparently calling for considerably less than
two-thirds of the seasonal adjustment for the quarter.
On official settlements there was a surplus before adjustment
of roughly $0.5 billion in January and February together (based on
weekly indicators for February). Because the seasonal adjustment
appropriate to the balance on official settlements is larger than that
for the liquidity balance, and because it applies much more to the

IV -2
beginning of the quarter, it is probable that the January-February
results, after adjustment, were close to balance.
Revision of import adjustments for late last year, and ad-
justments to January trade data, place recent trade developments in
slightly different perspective than indicated in the last Green Book.
January imports were up almost 4 per cent from the fourth quarter
rate, and the November-January average ($23-1/2 billion annual rate)
was 2 per cent above the fourth quarter. January exports eased a
little further below their November peak, and the November-January
average ($28 billion annual rate) was down slightly from the fourth
quarter. The trade surplus in the latest 3-month period was thus at
an annual rate of $4-1/2 billion, compared to $5 billion in the fourth
quarter.
While import demand continues to put pressure on the U.S.
payments position, there are signs that, beginning in January,
tightening U.S. credit markets have contributed to favorable develop-
ments in bank credit flows. The $125 million January reflow of short-
term loans and acceptance credits was greater than seasonal; this
followed a December outflow about in line with the customary seasonal
pattern. There was also an $80 million reflow of long-term bank
credit in January. Seasonally adjusted, the total reflow was about
$100 million.
Some caution may be required in interpreting the January
reflow of short-term credit because the non-seasonal part resulted
mainly from reflows from Japan, and may have reflected special

IV -3
circumstances in that country as well as tightened positions of banks
in the United States. More striking evidence on changes in foreign
credit activity of U.S. banks relates to term loans. Confidential
Treasury data on new term loan commitments show only about $60 million
in January, compared to an average of about $100 million a month in
the last half of 1965. Moreover, only very small commitments have so
far been reported for February, and the rate since the turn of the year
is probably under half of last autumn's rate. Since gross repayments
and amortizations this year are probably at about a $1 billion annual
rate, maintenance of the recent rate of commitments -- with a parallel
rate of gross disbursements -- would lead to a substantial net reflow
on term loans.
Recent developments abroad. The marked contrasts that have
been noted between policy orientations of the financial authorities
in a half dozen leading countries continue to exist. France, Italy,
and Japan have upswings under way, and are pressing for further
expansion. Germany has succeeded in leveling off its domestic in-
vestment demand, but wages and consumer demand are still rising
strongly and monetary policy remains tight. Britain's domestic
situation is in some respects like Germany's, but prices have been
rising more rapidly, and its external payments situation is pre-
carious. Canada is still experiencing rapid expansion and mounting
inflationary strain; for the moment, at least, restrictive monetary
policy is playing the chief role in resisting further growth of
excess demand.

Expansion policies in France have been taking the form
chiefly of fiscal action, including tax reform and reduction, and now
a proposed 10 per cent investment credit against the corporation in-
come tax. This credit, announced in February, will be restricted to
capital goods amortizable over seven years or more ordered in 1966 and
delivered this year or next year. During 1965 there was no significant
change in bank credit expansion, which continued at about a 10 per cent
annual rate after the formal ceiling was lifted.
Continued strong advance in industrial production toward the
end of 1965 was probably accompanied by the start of an upturn in pri-
vate investment spending. Official experts believe that industrial
output will continue to rise rapidly in the first half of 1966 -- at
an annual rate of 7 or 8 per cent, as it has since the early months of
1965. In January the index dropped a sharp 2 per cent, but that is
thought to have resulted mainly if not entirely from extreme weather
conditions. Order backlogs for consumer goods rose markedly in the
fourth quarter, inventories of finished goods declined, and production
of most types of consumer goods advanced.
French official reserve gains have lately been rather small:
$9 million in December, $8 million in January, and $35 million in
February which, however, occurred almost entirely in the closing days
of the month. In December, the French commercial banks' net foreign
assets rose by $83 million, and French banks reportedly continued to
place large amounts of funds abroad in January and most of February,
in response to the upward movement of interest rates in foreign centers.

This export of funds was a factor in a very tight money market over
the February month-end; the Bank of France stated that "massive" interven-
tion was required to keep call money rates from exceeding the 4-5/8
per cent limit the Bank maintains. This tightness led to some repatria-
tion of funds, and consequent official reserve gains, at the end of
February.
While Italian monetary policy remains expansionary, the
Government's main weapon for promoting recovery and expansion continues
to be sharply rising public expenditures. Increases in the central
government's cash outlays on budget account have assumed extraordinary
proportions, helped by a shortening of lags between authorizations and
actual spending; in the first eleven months of 1965 these outlays were
32 per cent greater than a year earlier. The increase in the budget
deficit has posed no financing problem because the Bank of Italy has
made large-scale direct advances to the Treasury and commercial banks
have expanded their bond portfolios. The persistently rapid rise in
the money supply has remained an outstanding feature of the monetary
situation; the year-to-year rise was 15 per cent in November.
A significant development in the second half of 1965 was the
beginning of revival in business investment spending. Residential
construction dropped off further, but orders and outlays for equip-
ment turned up. Total fixed investment outlays, public and private,
are officially estimated to have risen nearly 3 per cent in the third
quarter (seasonally adjusted and in real terms) and by a further 2-1/2
per cent in the fourth quarter.

The rise in Italian imports accelerated after mid-year,
and November imports were 4 per cent above the third-quarter average.
Seasonally-adjusted industrial production (excluding con-
struction) resumed its advance in the autumn, rising a total of 3-1/2
per cent over the three months from August to November, when it was
9 per cent higher than a year earlier. Output advanced in most
industries, but auto output dropped sharply following the rapid rise
last spring, seemingly to let excessive inventories run down.
Japanese industrial production, seasonally adjusted, advanced
3-1/2 per cent in January after rising 1 per cent in the previous month.
The good January performance brought the index to a new high, 6 per
cent above the level a year earlier. As a result of this and other
developments, the Minister of Finance stated on March 1 that "business
is definitely on the way to recovery," although he cautioned that it
would be "several years" before full recovery could be achieved.
Other indications of recovery include an increase in producers'
shipments and a rise in machinery orders. Although lower than a year
earlier, orders for machinery have been rising since June of last year
and in December increased 5 per cent.
Seasonally adjusted data indicate that there has been an
acceleration in monetary expansion. Consumer prices rose 1 per cent
in February to a level 6 per cent higher than a year earlier, and
wholesale prices have also been rising substantially in recent months.
Since last August Japanese imports have tended to rise and
exports to level off or decline. A particularly sharp rise in imports

IV -7
occurred in February. A seamen's strike from late November to late
January was suspended during the New Year season, with the result that
January exports were unusually large. Nevertheless, the three-month
trade surplus of $80 million in December-February (seasonally adjusted)
was much below the $190 million surplus of the third quarter of 1965.
German monetary policy now has the"urgent aim," according
to the January monthly report of the Bundesbank, of stabilizing the
price level, and along with that, restoring equilibrium in current
transactions with other countries. During the second half of 1965
demand for capital equipment leveled off, and steel orders dropped as
users aimed at reducing their inventories. But demand for consumer
goods and housing construction continued to rise. The labor market has
remained extremely tight, with indications that labor is being hoarded
in industries where production has fallen off.
There was some improvement in the German trade position in
the latter part of 1965. Though imports of finished manufactures con-
tinued to rise strongly, imports of materials fell off, and were no
larger than a year earlier. Exports increased sharply in November and
December after remaining stable in the spring and summer months. As
a result, the trade balance (computed with c.i.f. imports) shifted to
surplus. However, the current account as a whole (including transfer
payments as well as services) remained in deficit, especially after
allowance for seasonal variations.
Recent Bundesbank actions are intended to maintain a fairly
tight rein on bank liquidity. In the closing months of 1965 the

IV -8
liquidity squeeze was somewhat relieved -- apart from temporary
year-end tightness -- by government expenditures from cash balances
at the central bank and by the shift toward surplus in the balance of
payments. The Bundesbank has now announced that on May 1 the addi-
tional 12-1/2 per cent cut in rediscount quotas originally scheduled
for last October -- but postponed in view of the severity of the
liquidity squeeze at that time -- will come into effect. Another recent
action having the effect of increasing reserve requirements is the
tightening of conditions under which banks can count short-term foreign
assets as an offset to foreign liabilities in the calculation of their
reserve requirements: loans to foreigners on which banks have made
roll-over commitments can no longer be used as an offset.
On March 3, the Bundesbank again raised its rates on 6-month
and longer money market paper by 1/8 per cent,the second such change
in two weeks. The 6-month rate is now 1/4 per cent above that offered
by the Dresdner Bank, and the one-year rate is equal to the Dresdner
Bank's. Probably these increases in rates are intended (1) to encourage
banks to hold their liquid assets in Germany rather than abroad, and
(2) to resist efforts of large banks to absorb liquidity from else-
where within the banking system.
The British economy remains in the throes of a wage-price
spiral. Prices and wages rose further in January, and labor market
conditions were still exceedingly tight in February. While consumer
spending remained buoyant during the final months of 1965 and in January,
the growth in industrial production (through December) was kept quite
small -- partly because of severe labor shortages.

IV -9
Foreign trade figures have been showing large monthly zig-
zags. .Exports in January-February averaged 1 per cent higher than in
the fourth-quarter, but imports were up more -- by 3 per cent.
Despite the continuation of inflationary strain, the out-
look for a tough budget has been modified by two new developments.
First, Labor government officials have expressed a desire to "wait and
see" how much the recent further tightening of credit conditions will
dampen demand. Secondly, economic forecasts just published by the
National Institute of Social and Economic Research predict a substan-
tial rise in unemployment in coming months and a moderation in the wage-
price spiral. This view is based in part on the expectation that past
stabilization measures will finally do their job, and in part on the
assumption of a very successful "incomes policy." In line with these
findings, the Institute opposes a deflationary budget.
However, the Institute also noted that the Chancellor's target
of a balanced external position in the second half of 1966 will not be
reached. Rather, it predicted a deficit on current and long-term
capital account of about $240 million in that period, and a deficit
of $550 million for the full year. The estimated deficit for 1966 is
about half the size of the 1965 deficit and one-fourth that of 1964.
Because of domestic economic developments and the impending
election, conditions in British financial markets took a turn for the
worse in recent weeks. In the government bond market, yields rose
noticeably, especially at the short end. Between February 3 and
March 10, the yields on short-dated stocks jumped as much as 28 basis

IV -10
points to 6.78 per cent, while at the long end of the market the rate
on War Loan moved up 16 basis points to 6.76 per cent. Over the same
period, the sterling exchange rate dropped from 280.30 to 279.57 U.S. cents.
The Canadian Bank rate increase announced March 11 (effective
March 14) from 4-3/4 to 5-1/4 per cent reflects growing concern about
mounting inflationary strain in Canada. The consumer price index rose
further by 0.3 per cent in January while the wholesale price index
rose by 0.6 per cent. Compared with January 1965, consumer prices were
up 3 per cent, wholesale prices up 4 per cent. The fiscal policy out-
look is unclear, especially because the Liberal Government does not
have majority control in Parliament. The budget is due to be presented
late in April.
Because of the Bank rate change, commercial banks' profit
margins will be squeezed, leading them to be more selective and restrictive
in their loan policies. Higher costs of attracting new funds or of
liquidating investments can not be matched by higher lending rates,
because these were already at the 6 per cent legal ceiling.
Bank loans rose by 15 per cent from January 1965 to January
1966 (Wednesday averages of adjusted "general loans"). This rise in
loans was a chief cause of shrinkage in the banks' "more liquid asset"
ratio from 32.2 per cent of total assets at the beginning of 1965 to
30.0 per cent, the conventional minimum, at the end of the year. Partly
as a consequence of this squeeze on liquidity, seasonally adjusted bank
loans expanded by only 0.6 per cent in January 1966.
Canadian official reserves of gold, dollars, and IMF position
moved down from $2.9 billion on November 30 to about $2.8 billion on

IV -11
February 29. This reduction, though reflecting seasonal tendencies,
was in line with Canada's agreement to use some of its reserves in
financing the current account deficit this year, and it therefore
facilitated the decision to raise Bank rate. So, too, did the narrow-
ing of long-term interest rate differentials between Canada and the
United States since December.
