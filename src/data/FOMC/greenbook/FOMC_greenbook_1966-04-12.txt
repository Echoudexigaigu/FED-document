SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK
Outlook for GNP
The advance in business activity now appears a little stronger
than indicated three weeks ago. Output has continued to rise sparked
by further expansion in final outlays by consumers, business and govern-
ment. Inventory accumulation, while substantial, appears to be somewhat
lower than in the final quarter of last year. Over-all, we estimate
a first quarter rise in GNP that will approximate the very rapid fourth
quarter increase; the second quarter is expected to maintain a similarly
rapid pace of expansion.
Spurred by very sharp gains in income and employment, personal
consumption expenditures in the first quarter appear to have increased
more than in the fourth quarter, despite the rise in social security
taxes in January. Business fixed investment was up sharply from the
preceding quarter, a larger increase than anticipation surveys had
suggested. Substantial upward revisions in manufacturers' inventories
for January point to a first quarter increase only moderately below the
fourth quarter and about in line with what was projected here earlier.
On the other hand, defense purchases of goods and services appear to have
lagged slightly behind previous estimates.
Maintenance of the rapid pace in over-all activity in the
second quarter is expected to come mainly from further large gains in
consumption, business fixed investment and Federal spending. These
second quarter projections do not allow for a cutback in plant spending

I -2
in response to the President's request; in any event, the second quarter
may be too early to expect to see a response in the aggregate figures.
Neither do these projections allow for a speed-up in Federal defense
spending above the pattern implied in the Economic Report; a reassess-
ment of defense needs currently under way, however, may change prospects
for this and subsequent quarters, Meanwhile, Congressional approval
has been given or appears likely to be given to nondefense programs
and military pay increases costing over one billion dollars more than
allowed for in the Budget.
Resources and prices
Further expansion in business fixed investment continues to
add to productive capacity, but final demands are rising rapidly enough
to maintain and possibly intensify pressure on utilization rates. In
important sectors of durable goods manufacturing unfilled order backlogs
have continued to rise, even while manufacturers, as a group, have been
producing at or over 92 per cent of capacity.
Demands for labor are continuing very strong. Shortages of
experienced adult workers are becoming a major factor in labor market
developments, and a growing proportion of current adult unemployment is
of short-term duration and frictional in nature. Although unemployment
rose slightly in March, as did the unemployment rate, the increase was
mainly among teenagers, a group whose unemployment rate tends to
fluctuate from month to month.

I -3
A decline in the unemployment rate to a second-quarter average
of about 3.5 per cent is expected to accompany the projected further
rapid rise in GNP; much of the decline will have to reflect increased
employment in the teenage group, since adult unemployment is already
about as low as during the Korean conflict.
Hourly earnings in manufacturing are continuing to rise at a
rate slightly faster than in 1965. At the same time, gains in output
per manhour have slowed and unit labor costs have begun to show an
upward trend. In union and nonunion sectors outside of manufacturing,
recent data indicate wage gains have continued to accelerate. With
increases well above productivity gains, higher wage costs are contribu-
ting to upward price pressures in construction, retailing, services,
and other locally oriented activities.
Even though food prices recently have tended to stabilize,
industrial commodity price increases have become more widespread, and
declines fewer and largely restricted to some consumer goods industries.
Purchasing agents have increasingly reported some hedging against pro-
spective shortages and further price increases. Federal actions
recently have been taken to limit upward price pressures in particular
cases such as hides and nonferrous metals.
Declines in food prices are in prospect for later in the year,
and this should moderate the rise in the total wholesale and consumer
price indexes. The weekly wholesale price measures -- which cover only
a limited range of commodities -- have shown stability recently, but

I-4
the pressures extent on labor and plant resources, and the projected
further growth in demands, strongly suggest continued upward price
pressures throughout the nonfarm economy.
Availability of lendable funds
Restrictive bank lending policies are likely to continue,
and probably become more general over the next few months, as banks
continue to find it necessary to liquidate securities in order to satisfy
loan customers. However, there may be some respite from these pressures
at very large banks, where net time deposit inflows have recently
accelerated from the sharply reduced rates of earlier in the year. This
turn-around appears to reflect the higher recent offering rate on both
negotiable CD and other time deposits; some of the funds appear to have
been diverted from smaller banks and also from nonbank financial
institutions.
So long as loan demands remain strong, the more aggressive
competition for funds from large banks may be expected to continue and
tend to extend restraint throughout the financial system. Smaller banks
and nonbank intermediaries will have to raise deposit rates or face
reduced deposit growth and increased asset liquidation. Most recently,
it appears as if smaller banks have reduced their municipal acquisitions,
after sharply increasing them earlier in the year.
With respect to nonbank institutions, savings and loan
associations and mutual savings banks, already under pressure earlier
in the year, are likely to experience continued difficulty in obtaining

I -5
new funds from the public. Despite reduced net inflows from the public,
the total flow of funds to mortgage markets was strongly supported in
the first quarter by a contraseasonal volume of advances to savings and
loan associations from the Home Loan Bank System and by mortgage
purchases by FNMA. These sources of support are likely to be
more limited in the period ahead. Not only has FNMA taken further steps
to reduce the volume of the mortgage purchases, but the Federal Home
Loan Banks -- responding to the increased costs of their own borrowing --
have also raised rates on advances to record levels, in some cases as
high as 5-3/8 per cent.
Outlook for credit demands
Business loans at banks expanded at about a 15 per cent annual
rate in February-March. After a probable bulge over the April tax date,
some slowing of the growth rate seems likely. But business loan demands
may continue sufficiently strong to keep the expansion rate at about
the same 10-12 per cent range as obtained in most of the second half
of 1965.
Higher interest rates and credit rationing at banks may help
to inhibit some business borrowers, with the result that some financing
demands may be diverted to other sectors of the credit market. In the
weeks just past, however, the aggregate flow of new corporate and
minicipal bond offerings moderated, contributing to the recent sizable
downturn in yields. Security flotations were exceptionally high in the
winter, in part apparently reflecting some anticipatory borrowing.

I-6
Because of this and also the postponements of several issues as yields
reached peaks, the calendar immediately ahead appears light relative
to earlier in the year, although about equal to a year ago. Still, with
stringency continuing at banks, capital market financing may be supported
as some borrowers find the new market rate levels attractive. At the
same time, the money market may have to absorb more liquid asset dis-
position and larger commercial and finance company paper offerings.
Looking beyond the immediate capital market calendar, pro-
jections of continued heavy capital spending by both businesses and State
and local government suggest that demands for long-term funds will
remain large. With interest rates presently sharply below their early
March high, borrowers may be encouraged to add further to near-term
offerings, which would renew upward pressures on interest rates.
While there are no indications as yet of a sizable build-up in calendar,
it still appears likely on balance that rates in corporate and municipal
markets will rise above current levels. The mortgage market has not
shared in the easing of credit conditions that have recently characterized
bond markets, and present indications are for continued upward pressures
on rates and terms in this sector.
Balance of payments
In the first quarter of 1966, the payments position showed
neither the kind of improvement earlier hoped for by the Administration
nor a renewed deterioration such as has more recently been feared.

I- 7
The deficit on the liquidity basis remained at an annual rate of about
$1-1/2 billion. On the official reserve transactions basis, the deficit
fell very sharply from the swollen level of the previous quarter as
foreigners added to their liquid dollar balances after reducing them
earlier.
The merchandise trade surplus shrank to an annual rate of $4
billion in January-February, with exports down and imports up. This
deterioration in trade was offset by improvements elsewhere in the
balance of payments accounts that cannot yet be identified. While
seasonally adjusted reflows of U.S. bank credit increased sharply from
the fourth quarter to January-February as domestic credit conditions
tightened, there was a nearly offsetting increase in U.S. purchases of
foreign securities (mainly Canadian) newly issued in this country.
Probably investment income receipts recovered from their sharp fourth-
quarter dip, but data on these and on other service and capital trans-
actions are lacking.
There is little prospect of substantial over-all improvement
in the balance of payments this year. The outcome will depend importantly
on domestic demand and credit developments: e.g., on whether inflationay
pressures are sufficiently restrained to permit recovery of the merchandise
trade surplus; on whether the continued pressure on U.S. banks leads to
further reflows of bank credit; and on the extent to which direct invest-
ment outflows are held down by a squeeze on the liquidity of U.S.

I-8
corporations as well as by the Commerce Department's voluntary program.
A favorable resolution of these uncertainties might hold the liquidity
deficit in 1966 to a rate of about $1-1/2 billion despite increasing
military expenditures in Vietnam, with the official settlements
deficit somewhat lower, although not as low as in the first quarter.

THE ECONOMIC PICTURE IN DETAIL
The Nonfinancial Scene
Gross National Product. The first quarter gain in GNP is
likely to be a little larger than was indicated three weeks ago. A
GNP of $712 billion is now estimated for the first quarter (data for
the quarter are still quite incomplete) and is expected to be followed
by a rise to $726 billion for the second quarter. The quarterly in-
crease, $14.8 billion and $14.0 billion, respectively, are each $1
billion more than expected at the time of our last report. However,
the small differences noted do not alter the over-all picture of general
expansion or materially affect the anticipated level of GNP of $731
billion depicted earlier for 1966.
A rise in consumption expenditures of $9 billion (annual
rate) is now indicated for the first quarter as compared with $8.5
billion in the fourth quarter. Retail sales were revised up consi-
derably in January for both durable and nondurable goods. Available
evidence for February can be interpreted as showing sales being main-
tained at the high January level and weekly figures for March indicate
a probable further rise.
The high and rising level of consumer expenditures for goods
and services largely reflects another very sharp jump in personal in-
come in the first quarter--over 9.5 per cent on an annual rate basis
for wages and salaries, and 7.5 per cent for total personal income.

II -2
While the savings rate is now estimated to fall somewhat in the first
quarter this is almost entirely due to a statistical technicality in
national income accounting practice. The current national income
practice counts as personal contributions to social insurance at the
beginning of the year the whole increase in social security taxes--i.e.,
that part due to the lifting of the base effective January 1, 1966, from
$4,800 to $6,600 as well as that due to the higher tax rate. Since most
individuals in fact will not pay taxes on the higher earnings until after
midyear, less than half of the $3.0 billion, annual rate, increase in
social security contributions indicated for the first quarter is likely
currently to affect personal spending decisions. If allowance were
make for actual timing of the increased contributions resulting from the
higher wage base, the savings rate would remain about unchanged from
the fourth quarter 5.6 per cent level.
Business fixed investment apparently increased somewhat more
in the recent quarter than had been projected in the Commerce-SEC
anticipation survey. The combined showing of large increases in
nonresidential construction activity and in shipments of machinery
and equipment in January and February from their fourth quarter averages
suggest some underestimation in the February survey first quarter total
on which our preceding estimate had been based.
Business inventory investment in the first quarter remains
as estimated earlier; moderate declines are indicated from the very
high fourth quarter rates for both farm and nonfarm inventory

II -3
accumulation. Inventory data available for the first quarter are still
quite fragmentary. The moderate decline estimated for nonfarm accumula-
tion is based on January figures for manufacturers, recently revised
upward, and distributors, and on preliminary February data for manu-
facturers only which are also assumed to be subject to upward revision.
Exports of goods and services in the first quarter did not
increase as much as anticipated earlier according to present data,
and net exports have been revised down from our earlier estimate to a
level below the fourth quarter rate. In the second quarter, however,
exports are expected to increase more than the relatively large rise
projected for imports, with the result that net exports are projected
to rebound to their fourth quarter rate.
Purchases of goods and services by Federal and by State and
local governments in the first quarter are now indicated to have in-
creased slightly less than estimated three weeks ago, which in turn
had been revised down slightly from the preceding projection. Federal
government expenditures (N.I.A. basis) have been increasing somewhat
less rapidly than had been expected, with slight shortfall indicated
for defense spending. However, it is expected that any shortfall in
defense spending will be made up later. The somewhat slower-than-
expected rise in State and local government purchases reflects the slower
pace at which projects supported by Federal grants-in-aid are get-
ting underway.

II -4
A further substantial expansion in economic activity is
expected in the second quarter. The increases now projected for con-
sumption expenditures and for private domestic investment take into
account the upward revisions in our estimates for the first quarter.
While a number of businesses, in response to the President's request,
have indicated willingness to pare their capital investment projects,
it is unlikely that any significant effects on expenditures will be
achieved in the current quarter, although salutary psychological
effects on price pressures may well result from the request. Thus,
for the present, the increase in business fixed investment indicated
by the February Commerce-SEC survey is incorporated in our projection
for the second quarter. In addition, a rise is projected for net
exports.

Industrial production. Industrial production in March is
estimated to have increased further but at a somewhat less rapid pace
than in other recent months. Output in the first quarter of 1966
averaged about 151 per cent--3 per cent above the average for the
fourth quarter of 1965 and 8 per cent above a year earlier.
The table shows estimated first quarter output for the
total index and major market groupings and per cent changes from the
first and fourth quarters of 1965 to the first quarter of 1966.

Auto assemblies increased slightly in March and were at an
annual rate of about 9.4 million units compared with 9.1 million in
February. A strike at General Electric, which began March 3, curtailed
output of appliances. Production of color television sets, however,
continued to set new records. Employment data for March indicate a
further rise in both business and defense equipment. Output of trucks
was maintained at a record level.

II -7
Output of iron and steel rose again in March to a level
within 90 per cent of the high level reached during the strike-threat
buildup last summer. Other weekly production data indicate increases
in output of crude oil, refined petroleum products, and coal. Out-
put of paperboard continued at record levels.
Consumer credit. The seasonally adjusted rise in consumer
credit during February was the smallest in the 1965-66 period. There
was slackening of growth in all loan categories with auto credit and
home improvement loans slowing the most. Growth in total instalment
credit outstanding was only $537 million for the month, or $6.4 billion
on a seasonally adjusted annual rate basis. This compares with an
annual rate in January of $7.5 billion and a total expansion of
$8.0 billion for all of 1965. Noninstalment credit rose $120 million
in February, about in line with the high level of retail sales.
Instalment credit extensions in February were below the
January level with decreases evident in all loan categories. Repay-
ments on the other hand rose slightly, owing to a substantial increase
in auto credit payments; in other loan categories, repayments showed
little change or declined slightly.
Manufacturers' shipments, orders, and inventories. Manu-
facturers'unfilled orders increased further in February and so also
did inventories while shipments and new orders were little changed

II -8
from high January levels. With shipments holding at the advanced
January level while inventories increased, the ratio of inventories
to shipments edged up further. The ratio of unfilled orders to ship-
ments also rose further in February for durable goods producers,
although shipments of such goods advanced. Increases in shipments
were reported by metal producers and fabricators and transportation
equipment manufacturers, while shipments by producers of other durable
goods and of nearly all nondurable goods declined a little.
New orders for durable goods were unchanged from their record
January level, instead of being down somewhat as indicated by the
advance figures. February orders declined about 4 per cent for both
electrical and nonelectrical machinery and 9 per cent for aircraft.
Despite the declines, backlogs of unfilled orders in these three
industries rose moderately further. New Orders received by iron and
steel producers in February were a fifth larger than in the preceding
month.
Manufacturers further increased their inventories in
February, with most industries contributing to the rise. However,
the February rise was at a slower rate than in January and in the
fourth quarter.

The total inventory increase in January and February was as much as
manufacturers had anticipated earlier for the whole first quarter.
In the last two quarters of 1965, actual inventory increases exceeded
anticipated inventory increases by wide margins.
Wholesale prices. Since last autumn the total wholesale
commodity price index has risen 2 per cent and it is about 4 per cent
above a year ago. This has reflected in large part a sharp rise in
prices of livestock and livestock products, including milk and eggs
as well as meats. Since February meat prices have levelled off or
declined.
The wholesale price index for industrial commodities has
risen 1 per cent since last autumn and is about 2 per cent above a
year ago. There was an acceleration in the rise in these prices in
the monthly figures for January and February of this year with the annual
rate of increases being between 2-1/2 to 3-1/2 per cent. Earlier, in

II -10
1965, about 40 per cent of the published groups were rising, another
40 per cent were unchanged and the remaining 20 per cent were declining.
In January and February this year, the proportion rising increased
to 53 while 32 per cent were unchanged, and 15 declined.
The BLS weekly series for the industrial component of the
total index is based on a limited number of items. This series was
unchanged from mid-February to mid-March. It probably does not pro-
vide an adequate advance estimate of the monthly industrial total
because it does not include a number of products in which price ad-
vances have occurred or have been announced since early February,
including electrical and nonelectrical machinery, fabricated metal
products, nonmetallic minerals, lumber, paper, chemicals, heavy trucks,
rubber, and leather goods. Reports in purchasing journals suggest
some attempts at protective buying in response to expected price
increases and material shortages.
Consumer prices. The consumer price index from mid-January
to mid-February rose .5 per cent to 111.6 per cent of the 1957-59
average, with food accounting for about three-fourths of the increase.
Meat prices rose nearly 2 per cent further; as noted earlier, at
wholesale, meat prices have levelled off or declined somewhat since
then. Poultry prices increased 8 per cent in February partly because
of seasonally reduced supplies and also because of some shift in de-
mand away from high priced red meats. Prices of fresh vegetables

II -11
rose by over 10 per cent mainly because of adverse weather in growing
areas. Food prices, which have accounted for more than one-half of
the 2.5 per cent rise in the consumer index from a year ago, are
expected by the Department of Agriculture to decline over the rest
of 1966.
Nonfood commodities from January to February increased .1
per cent as increases in apparel and footwear were nearly offset by
declines in new and used cars. Services, continuing the upward trend
of about 2.4 per cent per year, rose .2 per cent with medical care
increasing .3 and transportation .2 per cent.

Labor market. Employment in nonfarm establishments advanced
very rapidly in March--up 320,000, a rise almost as large as the upward
revised February increase of 340,000 (the preliminary report had indi-
cated an increase of 260,000 in February). For the first quarter as
a whole, gains in nonfarm employment were still accelerating. The rise
of over 1 million in this quarter was even somewhat larger than in the
fourth quarter of 1965. Also indicative of the current strength of
demand for labor is that the first quarter rise this year significantly
exceeded the rise in the first quarter of last year when, spurred on
by record production of autos and large accumulation of steel inventories
output and employment moved up by what was then considered extraordinary
amounts.

While the over-all increase in March in nonfarm employment
about equalled the previous month, the rise of 85,000 in manufacturing,
although large, was somewhat smaller than in February. In part the
slowing reflected a leveling-off of employment in the machinery industry
where supplies of skilled labor have become increasingly scarce. Hours
of work in the industry, in contrast, continued to rise and at 44.1
hours in March were the longest workweek in the industry since World
War II. Employment in other metal producing industries continued to
advance fairly rapidly but the pace was somewhat slower than the
previous month. Availability of experienced workers may now also be
limiting employment advances in these industries. A smaller employ-
ment gain in the nondurable goods sector in March, however, can be
largely attributed to the previous month's sharp rise in the apparel
industry following settlement of the New York transit strike rather
than to current labor shortages. Average hours of work, in manufactur-
ing in March were maintained at the postwar record high of 41.6 hours
reached in February.
Outside of manufacturing, employment gains showed no signs
of moderating. Construction employment had declined in January and
February from a very high year-end level but advanced again sharply
in March to a level well above December and was about 200,000, or
more than 6 per cent, higher than a year ago. Trade, services and
Government have been able to continue to absorb large numbers of
workers most of whom would apparently be inexperienced women and

II -14
youth. In these industries the rate of increase in the first quarter
(an annual rate of about 2 million) was sharper than in the fourth
quarter of last year.
In all, 3 million workers were added to nonfarm industries
in the past 12 months, the largest yearly increase in the postwar
period. Interestingly, manufacturing gains have been especially
rapid this past year, in contrast to the earlier employment experience,
but nevertheless accounted for only one-third the total rise in non-
farm employment, about the same proportion that manufacturing employ-
ment is to total nonagricultural (payroll) employment.
Unemployment. The limited number of experienced adult
workers available for jobs continues to be a dominant factor in labor
market developments. Although the unemployment rate rose slightly to
3.8 per cent in March, following 6 consecutive months of decline, the
rise was mainly accounted for by an increase in unemployment among
teenage youth , a group whose unemployment rate has been more volatile
from month to month than that for older workers. For adults--men and
women 20 years of age and over who comprise 90 per cent of the civilian
labor force--the unemployment rate in March was 2.9 per cent. This is
the second month it has been under 3 per cent and about as low a rate
for this group as during the Korean conflict. This suggests that the
jobless rate for most workers in the labor force is close to what can
be considered a frictional unemployment level.

II -15
Recent data from unemployment compensation programs also
strikingly point up the low and diminishing supplies of available
workers with past employment experience. Since the survey week
(week ending March 12) for the household and establishment reports,
the seasonally adjusted number of persons filing claims under the
State unemployment compensation programs has declined sharply. In
the last week of March new claims dropped to 160,000, the lowest
number for the comparable week in any year since the end of World
War II. Moreover, by the end of March less than 2.5 per cent
(seasonally adjusted) of all covered workers were receiving benefits,
which is about as low a rate as was reached any time during the
Korean conflict.
With the unemployment rate among adult workers low, the
over-all unemployment rate may be less responsive in coming months
to strong demands for labor. (For men 25 years of age and over, for
example, the unemployment rate has shown little change in the past
4 months.) Therefore, the elasticity of the unemployment rate in
coming months will increasingly reflect (1) a rising rate of tran-
sitional unemployment and job changing, (2) the high proportion of
very mobile young workers among the job seekers and (3) any inability
to make important inroads in the extremely high rates of unemployment
among nonwhite youths.
With labor demands continuing strong and supplies dwindling,
turnover has increased in recent months, and voluntary worker mobility

II -16
has speeded up. This usually happens in a tightening labor market as
more workers find they can sucessfully shop around for better jobs.
With a higher proportion of workers changing jobs, the rate of frictional
unemployment may tend to rise. Short-term unemployment becomes a much
larger proportion of total unemployment in periods of labor shortage
than during periods of labor surplus.
In addition to rising cyclically, the frictional unemployment
rate may now be higher secularly than in other low unemployment years,
such as in the 1955-57 expansion or the Korean period. The reason can
be traced to the changing demographic composition of the labor force
and its effect on unemployment. Of particular significance is the
higher proportion of young workers in the job market currently than
a decade or so ago.

Teenagers accounted for 10 per cent of the civilian labor
force in March 1966, a higher proportion than in March 1957 when the

II -17
total unemployment rate was the same as currently. With more teenagers
now in the work force, their share of total unemployment has increased
sharply--from 22 to 31 per cent. In contrast, women accounted for only
a slightly higher share of labor force and unemployment than in 1957,
while the adult male fraction declined sharply. Of the three groups,
however, only the jobless rate of teenagers worsened over the period,
partly reflecting the pressure of large population growth.
Young workers take longer to find jobs and typically move
frequently from job to job before settling in their chosen vocation.
As a result, their rate of job turnover, and consequently their implied
frictional unemployment rate, tends to be well above the average. Even
in the tightest labor market in the postwar period, the teenage job-
less rate has remained 2-1/2 to 3 times higher than the total un-
employment rate. The increasing proportion of these highly mobile
young workers in the current unemployment count would naturally tend
to weigh up the total unemployment rate and the proportion considered
frictional. Thus, current unemployment rates would tend to overstate
the availability of unemployed labor resources when compared with
earlier periods of low unemployment.

In March 1966, about one out of four nonwhite youths in the
labor force were unable to find jobs, whereas one in ten white teen-
agers were unemployed. Over the past year the jobless rate of white
youths improved, while the jobless rate of nonwhite youths remained
about level. Recently, it has been the high and stable rate of un-
employment among nonwhite youths that has maintained the 2-to-l un-
employment rate differential between nonwhite and white workers which
has persisted for so long. Among adult nonwhite women, the unemploy-
ment rate has declined more sharply than for white workers in the
past year, while for adult men it has been less rapid. However,
nonwhite adult men have lower unemployment rates currently than a
decade ago, even though the total rate was the same. In contrast,
the teenage nonwhite rate has increased sharply.

II -19
Construction activity. Outlays for new construction reached
a record rate this winter, reflecting mainly the continued upthrust in
expenditures for business and related installations and a temporary
surge in private housing starts toward the end of last year. However,
in February, building contracts dipped for the second successive month,
according to F. W. Dodge, and there were other indications of possible
weakening in construction activity as a whole. In the residential
sector, the further rise in residential construction initially re-
ported for February will probably be revised downward because of the
sharp reduction in starts reported after the expenditure release.
In the public sector,recent announcement of steps taken to
reduce Federal expenditures may begin to have some effect on outlays
as the year progresses. These steps were undertaken not only to dampen
over-all demands but also as an example for private industry and State
and local government. In recent years, public construction as a whole
has accounted for 30 per cent of total construction outlays, with high-
ways alone accounting for 10 per cent of the total. Through February
of this year, public construction had been fluctuating within a narrow
range just below the high level last November.
The sharp decline in private housing starts in February --
like the unusual rise in December -- apparently reflected weather
influences for the most part, although firming of mortgage market was
also a factor. Assuming some recovery in March, starts in the first
quarter of the year may have approximated the 1.45 million annual rate

II -20
of first two months of the year. If so, this would make the first
quarter only moderately lower than 1965 as a whole and about the
same as the recent low in the third quarter. It would also be about
in line with our earlier projections for the quarter and with re-
cently revised trade expectations for the year 1966.
A test of the viability of this rate of housing starts may
come later this spring, when many commitments made before the end of
1965 will have been worked off and when financing demands will be
seasonally higher, particularly in the northern states.

Farm outlook. Farm production and price prospects indicate
that another year of relatively favorable returns is in store for
farmers. In 1965, net realized incomes of farmers rose from a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of $12.5 billion in the first quarter to
$14.8 billion in the second and for the whole year totaled $14.1 billion.

II -21
This was the highest net return realized by farmers since 1952. Sharply
rising prices received for meat animals sparked by expanding consumer
demands coinciding with cyclically low hog marketings, were largely
responsible for the increased income. Production costs rose but at
a slower pace than sales receipts.
It seems safe to assume that net returns were equally favor-
able in the first quarter of 1966. It is unlikely, however, that such
returns can be sustained throughout the year in view of production
prospects. Through March, the volume of marketings were somewhat
larger than a year earlier and farm prices averaged 13 per cent higher.
The volume of crops marketed from the record 1965 harvest was an
eighth above a year earlier and average prices were off a little
despite sharply higher prices received for short crops of fresh winter
vegetables. Prices of livestock and products averaged 25 per cent
above the relatively low prices that prevailed a year ago and the
volume of marketings was approximately 3 per cent less.
In the months ahead supplies of hogs, poultry, and eggs are
expected to become more plentiful as production in process reaches
markets. Milk production, now running well below a year earlier be-
cause of reductions in cow numbers and lower output per cow, should
increase somewhat in response to the hike in the dairy price supports
announced on March 31. Beef cattle numbers are large enough to permit
somewhat larger marketings than in 1965 throughout the year, but
probably not at the 5 per cent higher rate of the first quarter.

II -22
Another year of large crop output is in prospect. Farmers'
planting intentions on March 1 indicated that the 1966 acreage of 17
major field crops would be about the same as the acreage actually
planted to these crops in 1965. Some important shifts in acreage
plans were made in response to changes in Federal programs. Rice and
soybean acreages were increased, largely because of eased planting
curbs, and cotton acreage was cut 23 per cent reflecting participation
in the new cotton acreage diversion program. Corn farmers planned to
increase acreage 2 per cent which, with favorable growing conditions,
would add to surplus stocks.
March 31 announcements of an increase in the soybean price
support 11 per cent above the 1965 level and an extension of the sign-
up period for the feed grain program may induce farmers to shift more
acreage from corn to soybeans. Such a shift would supplement a
reduced cottonseed crop and avoid surplus production of corn.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL SITUATION
Bank credit. Loans and investments at all commercial banks,
under the pressure of heavy tax-related demands, apparently expanded
at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of about 10 per cent in March,
following essentially no growth in February. The seesaw February-March
movement reflects an unusual temporary reduction in bank credit in
the last statement week of February and an unusually large increase
late in March. The former decline was due mainly to large repayments
of Government security dealer loans as positions were temporarily
reduced, while the latter increase was due to a large rise in dealer
financing needs late in the month and heavy tax borrowings by finance
companies. These developments, late in each month, tend to bias
February credit expansion downwards, while biasing the March data
upwards.
Total loans in March rose more rapidly than in any month since
last summer, mainly as a result of the above-mentioned expansion in
loans to finance companies and to Government security dealers. Finance
companies, with bank loans more expensive and less available, had in-
creased their sale of commercial paper by an unusually large amount
early in 1966. At the tax date, these companies faced very large
maturities and consequently increased their bank loans quite sharply at
midmonth, borrowing over $1 billion from weekly reporting banks alone;
their subsequent repayments have been slow,

III -2
Business loan expansion also accelerated from February to
March, and was especially heavy over the tax and dividend period.
However, business loan growth during the past two months remained below
the extremely rapid December-January pace. Loan demands have recently
been strong in most industrial sectors, but especially in the metals,
textiles, and miscellaneous manufacturing industries, and among trade
firms,

To finance loan demand in March,banks in the aggregate had to
bite deeper into their security portfolios. Liquidation of Treasury
issues were smaller than in February, in part because many large banks
were nearing minimum levels of such security holdings. However, bank
liquidation of other securities -- mainly municipals -- was very large
in March, about $600 million, seasonally adjusted. Last month's reduction

III -3
in such securities was the largest month-to-month decline of the current
expansion; indeed, in only one other previous month since 1961 have
holdings of other securities declined. In addition, banks were forced
to increase their borrowings from the Federal Reserve to an average of
$550 million, from the average $470 million in February, as nonborrowed
reserves declined on a seasonally adjusted basis.
Since year-end, weekly reporting banks have accounted for all
of the liquidation of securities by commercial banks. Larger banks
over this period have been liquidating both Treasury issues and other
securities, on balance, while smaller banks -- with their loan demands
less strong and their time and savings deposit inflows better maintained
than was the case at larger banks -- have added to their portfolios
of all securities, especially municipals.
In recent weeks, however, preliminary indications suggest
that the smaller banks have also been adjusting their security portfolios --
liquidating Treasury issues and reducing their rate of acquisition of
other securities -- apparently without any unusually large expansion in
loans. As indicated below, this change probably reflects a shift of time
and savings deposits from smaller to larger banks, a shift that tends to
spread monetary restraint to a larger group of banks.
Bank deposits and the money stock. The seasonally adjusted
annual rate of growth of time and savings deposits at all commercial
banks in March was the same as the 6.5 per cent rate of February.

III -4
However, there were unusually large shifts in the composition and
location of inflows of such deposits during the month.
City banks were able to expand their inflows of time deposits
quite sharply last month; the rate of inflow of total time and savings
deposits at reserve city banks more than doubled from February to March
on a seasonally adjusted basis. Time deposits other than negotiable
CD's rose by almost $600 million in the first four reporting weeks last
month, over twice as rapidly as in the same period last year. This
increased inflow apparently reflects higher rates on and more aggressive
advertising of smaller denomination nonnegotiable certificates. It is
likely that some of these funds were withdrawn not only from savings
deposits -- which continue weak -- but also from smaller banks. For
example, total time and savings deposit inflows at country banks de-
celerated in March, on a seasonally adjusted basis. The reduced inflow
of time and savings deposits at smaller banks is an important reason
for their smaller municipal purchases noted above.
Also contributing to the increased inflow of time deposits to
reserve city banks was their success in attracting CD money. Despite
heavy March maturities, New York banks added almost $500 million to
outstanding CD's in the last two weeks of March, bringing total out-
standings just short of the peak late January level. Other banks are
apparently adding to their outstandings also.
New York City banks have been very aggressive in the CD
market, increasing offering rates from 12 to 25 basis points. As a

III -5
result, the spread of rates on 90 to 179 day CD's over the comparable
bill yield rose to a record level in late March of about 60 basis points
as shown in the table.

It is likely that city banks, having faced difficult roll-
over problems with their outstanding CD's, heavy loan demands, and
increased security liquidations, have decided to raise their offering
rates in order both to lengthen their CD maturities and to gain funds for
loan demands. Market circumstances have also been favorable due to the
recent decline in bill rates. By the end of March, the most often quoted

III -6
CD rates at New York banks were 5 per cent on less than 90 day CD's,
5-1/4 per cent for 90 to 269 day maturities, and 5-3/8 for 270 day and
over money -- an increase since early March of 25 basis points for short-
term CD's and 12.5 basis points for longer maturities; the highest reported
rates rose 35 and 25 basis points, respectively, over the month.
Since late February, the seasonally adjusted money stock has
risen sharply, increasing at an annual rate of over 9 per cent during
March. Most of this increase reflected a reduction in seasonally
adjusted Treasury balances about equal to the increase in private demand
balances. Over the first quarter, the money stock rose at a 4.5 per
cent annual rate, somewhat below that for all of 1965.
U.S. Government securities market. Yields on Treasury notes
and bonds declined further in late March and early April, extending the
decline which began in early March. Meanwhile, Treasury bill rates have
fluctuated in a lower range since mid-March and recently the 3-month
bill has been quite close to the discount rate.

The month-long decline in Treasury bond yields has served to
erase 1/2 to 2/3 of the yield advance on intermediate- and long-term
Treasury issues that occurred after the discount rate increase in early
December. Factors contributing to recent market strength have included
a growing conviction that the earlier market correction had outpaced
economic developments and also a developing feeling that the
Administration is moving toward a proposal to raise taxes, thereby
lightening the task of monetary policy and relieving pressure on interest
rates. An additional strengthening influence on Treasury bond prices
has been the excellent receptions accorded many recent major corporate
and municipal issues.
The main thrust of the rally in U.S. Government bond prices
has come from strong dealer demand, however, rather than from invest-
ment buying. In recent weeks dealers have made strong efforts, first,
to cover sizable short positions and subsequently to build up net
long positions. In doing so, they have absorbed moderate investor
selling at rising prices. On April 4, dealers held $115 million, net,
of bonds due in over 5 years, their largest position in such issues since
November, as compared with a net short position of around $40 million
at the beginning of March.
Treasury bill rates, unlike other short-term rates, have been
under downward pressure in recent weeks. Even though net market demand
for bills has tapered off since mid-March, dealer inventories were
depleted by previous strong demand and dealers' willingness to build up

III -8
their inventories in recent auctions has helped to keep rates at the
lower end of their recent range. In addition, the maturity of $3.0
billion March tax bills as well as the completion in late March of the
Treasury's $100 million additions to the weekly bill auctions have served
to reduce available supplies of bills. The Treasury is not expected to
need to raise any cash through short-term debt issues in the current
quarter.
Yields on short-term debt instruments other than bills have
remained at their recent highs established after the prime loan rate
increase or have edged a bit higher as is shown in the table.

Treasury finance. The next Treasury financing operation will
be the regular May refunding, which will involve a relatively small
amount, $2.5 billion of publicly-held maturing debt. The terms of the
refunding will be announced in late April.
The Treasury is not expected to have to raise any further cash
in the current fiscal year through issues of its own debt. However,
consistent with the Budget Document, the Treasury's cash position may
be augmented by further sales of participation certificates by the
Export-Import Bank and, if necessary legislation is secured, by the
Small Business Administration. In addition, other Federal Agencies
are expected to continue to be sizable net borrowers of new cash in
the current quarter.
Corporate and municipal bond markets. The decline of bond
yields since early March has amounted to more than 1/3 of a percentage
point on new corporate bond issues and to about 1/5 of a percentage
point on State and local government bonds. In both markets, these
declines have erased more than half of the sharp yield advances which
had occurred from early December, when the discount rate was increased,
to early March. Although yields on seasoned corporate bonds have
moved divergently from other bond series in the past few weeks, they
always show a lagged response to rapid changes in other bond series.

l/ The movement of yields on new issues of corporate bonds has been
affected substantially in the past two months by the degree of protection
from early call provided for given issues. The March 4 high in the
new issue series was exaggerated by lack of call protection on the issues
sold that week; whereas averages for the weeks ending March 18, 25, and
April 1 are biased downward because the issues offered carried call
protection. Since any adjustment for variation in call protection would
be highly arbitrary and would have to be altered with changing market
circumstances, no such adjustment has been attempted in the new issue
series presented here.
The rather abrupt reversal in direction of bond yields since
early March seems to have been due more to a sense among bond market
participants that interest rate increases had overdiscounted the future
than to any real change in the underlying economic forces affecting the
supply and demand for long-term funds. This shift in attitude itself has
triggered responses among both lenders and borrowers which have
substantially strengthened the technical position of both corporate and
municipal bond markets, and in so doing contributed to the decline in yields.

III -11
As the historically high levels to which bond yields had
moved began to seem excessive to borrowers, new issue postponements
(chiefly in the municipal bond market) and less rapid additions to the
forward calendar helped to moderate immediate demands of borrowers on
capital markets. With the visible supply of new issues thus reduced to
more moderate levels, investors bid more aggressively for this smaller
volume at yields which began to run unusually attractive. At the end
of March, large bellweather issues in both corporate and municipal bond
markets -- the $250 million AT&T and the $100 million California
offerings -- attracted particular investor interest and declined in
yield on secondary trading, adding further to the general strengthening
of bond markets. Most recently, however, a few new corporate issues
reoffered at still lower yields have met with a reluctantly slow
reception.

III -12
Because the forward calendar of new corporate bond offerings
has grown less rapidly in recent weeks, the volume of new corporate issues
presently expected for public offering in April is about $100 million
smaller than the March volume -- which itself fell somewhat below earlier
estimates. This change follows a first quarter in which corporate
public offerings totaled over $1.8 billion or roughly twice the amount
offered in the like period of 1965.
Two key questions now facing the corporate market are
(1) the extent to which first quarter borrowing may have anticipated second
quarter business requirements, and (2) whether with yields now at lower
levels, new additions to the calendar will again pick up momentum.
Very recently several new offerings have been added to the near-term
projections that show large continuing business needs for funds. But
firm answers to the two questions must await further evidence.
Municipal bond offerings in March fell well below the volume
originally expected -- reflecting cancellations and postponements aggre-
gating in excess of $600 million (offset in part by advancement of the $100
million State of California offering). With the April calendar currently
estimated at about $800 million, this year's volume of offerings appears
to be running well behind last year's, except for the outsized January
supply. Here too, however, market participants are sensitive to the
possibility that the recent drop-off in yields may encourage a pick up
in new issues -- including some of those that were recently postponed.

III -13
Mortgage markets. Even though net inflows of funds to
depository-type institutions have slowed further this year net expansion in
mortgage debt in the first quarter is estimated to have approached the
advanced level of a year earlier. This increase, if realized, would
be somewhat larger than we had projected earlier. The difference reflects
a sharper-than-expected expansion in holdings by the Federal National
Mortgage Association, and a higher-than-anticipated rate of mortgage
activity by savings and loan associations -- supported in part by a much
less than seasonal reduction in borrowings from Federal Home Loan Banks.
As the quarter ended, however, such borrowing became more
excessive to the associations, when virtually all the Home Loan Banks
raised their rates on borrowings by amounts ranging from 1/8 to 5/8
per cent -- to levels between 5 and 5-3/8 per cent.
In February, FNMA purchases of Government-underwritten
home mortgages in the secondary market soared far above a year
earlier and well above the previous record in January. While offerings
of eligible mortgages for purchase by FNMA slackened a bit in
February, they appeared to be rising again in March. In a further
attempt to discourage this tendency, FNMA in early April announced
that it would limit the unpaid amount of mortgages it will buy to
$15,000. This compares with potential maxima of $30,000 for FHA-
insured mortgages and $21,425 for VA-guaranteed mortgages.

III -14
Trade reports continue to emphasize that the recent 1/4 per
cent upward adjustment in maximum permitted rates for Government-
underwritten mortgages for homes is too low to attract lenders under
current market conditions. As a result, discounts have continued,
especially-in the West, and there is concern about the availability of
mortgage funds, particularly for the sale of existing homes on which
new home-purchases depend to a marked extent.
In the market for conventional home mortgages, lenders appear
also to have become more selective, with some indication of tightening
of nonrate terms along with insistence on higher yields, according
to data now available for February. Loan amounts were appreciably
higher than a year earlier, however, reflecting in part further in-
creases in the price of properties being purchased.

The number of foreclosures of nonfarm real estate -- mainly
homes -- increased slightly in the fourth quarter of last year, but
the rate of 5.0 per thousand mortgaged structures was the same as in
the previous quarter and, as expected, somewhat below the recent high
of 5.2 per thousand reached in the second quarter of last year. For
1965, as a whole, the year-to-year increase in foreclosures was 7 per
cent, which was the smallest increase since 1959. In 1964, the increase
was 11 per cent.

Stock market. Common stock prices -- as measured by Standard
and Poor's composite index -- have risen about 5 per cent on balance
from their March 15 low, recovering about two-thirds of the earlier
decline from the record February 9 high. Although trading activity
during most of the recovery period was at a more moderate pace (about
7.4 million shares per day), most recently volume has picked up again,
averaging 9.6 million shares per day.

III -16
The price recovery associated with the period of moderate
trading was a bit hesitant, reflecting continued market sensitivity
to discussion of possible Federal actions on the tax and wage-price
fronts. But very recently the advances have been strong with
institutional investors reportedly buying blue chip stocks. Moreover,
market analysts expect that March earnings statements, soon to be
released, will prove to be more favorable than some had feared,
adding further to general investor interest.
Trading in low-priced stocks and special industry stock
groupings, which have consistently attracted a speculative following,
continues to be quite heavy. In fact these groups have registered
substantial price advances even in weeks when the broad indexes were
declining; and the indexes for stocks in the electronics, air transport,
radio-TV, and metal fabricating industry groupings have all moved
recently to new 1965-66 highs. To a considerable extent this continued
speculative activity in low-priced stocks and favored industry groupings
probably explains why stock market credit reported by firms in the New
York Stock Exchange margin panel showed an $88 million increase in
February at a time when the popular stock market averages were showing
sharp net declines.

U.S. balance of payments. Preliminary weekly indicators
for March, before seasonal adjustment, show a U.S. payments surplus on
the liquidity basis of roughly $100 million for the month, following
approximate balance in the 2-month period January-February. This implies
a deficit for the first quarter, after preliminary seasonal adjustment,
at an annual rate of about $1-1/2 billion, unchanged from the fourth
quarter. However, as indicated in the March 16 Green Book, adjustments
for the postponement into the first quarter of Canadian security issues
and for certain other unusual developments indicate that on other trans-
actions there was a moderate improvement from the fourth quarter.
Data presently available do not account for the improvement.
While there was a substantial reflow from abroad of outstanding U.S.
bank credits, this was offset by further narrowing of the trade surplus.
Merchandise imports in February continued at about the high
January rate of $23-1/4 billion annually; at this level they were un-
changed from the average for November-December, although up slightly from
the fourth quarter. (The February import figure reflects a tentative
statistical adjustment for carryover of import documents that is still
subject to revision.)
Exports in February were unchanged from January; the $27-1/4
billion annual rate in these months was down 3 per cent from the fourth
quarter. The decline was concentrated in non-agricultural exports;
agricultural exports, seasonally adjusted,were unchanged in January-
February from the fourth-quarter rate.

IV -2
By geographical area, the decline in exports through January
is apparently more than fully accounted for by reduced shipments to
Japan and to less developed countries in Asia and Africa. In December-
January (the latest data with country detail), total exports seasonally
adjusted but without other adjustments were down 3 per cent from October-
November. Exports to Japan were down one-sixth, possibly reflecting
the seamen's strike in that country from November to January. Exports
to Australia, South Africa and LDC's outside Latin America together
were off about 7 per cent, and those to Continental Europe fell slightly.
On the other hand, exports to Canada and the United Kingdom increased.
There were large reflows of U.S. bank credits again in
February; in the first two months of the year, banks under the VFCR
reported a net reduction of $385 million in claims covered by the
voluntary program--not seasonally adjusted. This figure differs only
slightly from the reduction in claims reported by all banks in the
United States (including agencies and branches of foreign banks) both
for their own account and for account of customers. With the February
data, there is evidence of a more widespread geographical pattern of
reflows than was apparent earlier, and hence an increased likelihood
that the reflows resulted from constraints on the supply of credit.
There have been sharp reductions in outstanding bank loans and
acceptance credits to Europe and Latin America, as well as in credits
to Japan. Much of the reduction has been accounted for by banks in
the New York Federal Reserve District, and may well reflect special
pressures on these banks. At the end of February, New York District

IV -3
banks reported outstanding claims under the VFCR below the October 31
level, while Chicago and San Francisco banks both remained about even
with their positions at end October.
Additional evidence of the effects of credit restraint may
be found in recent information on commitments on long-term loans.
Total commitments thus far reported for the first quarter amount to
$115 million -- approximately one-third of the average rate in the
second half of last year. Even with some additional reports still to
be received, it seems highly likely that the rate for the first
quarter will prove to be under half that of the last six months of
1965. Commitments on loans to developed and to less developed countries
have each been reduced proportionately; commitments for loans to finance
U.S. exports have been reduced by a slightly smaller percentage than
total commitments.
Foreign trade of other industrial countries. Strong upswings
in imports were occurring during the second half of 1965 in Canada, in
all of the Common Market countries but Germany, and in some other
European countries as well. These upswings in some cases continued
and intensified advances that had already been under way for periods
of varying length (from January 1965 for Belgium, from mid-1964 for
Italy, from early 1963 for Canada). In other cases, as in France, the
Netherlands, and Switzerland, there had been pauses of 12 months or more
during which imports were comparatively stable, before new upturns
occurred at the middle of last year.
While it is true that total 1965 imports of Common Market
countries were only 9 per cent above those of 1964 (see Appendix C), the

fluctuations. U.S. data (on balance-of-payments basis) show post-strike
effects in 1965-QII; rate of increase in 1st column is thereby magnified,
in 2nd column diminished.
seasonally adjusted annual rates of increase after last May were in the
15-to-20 per cent range for all Common Market countries until September,
and for all but Germany thereafter. Data available for France show a
continuation of the rapid advance into 1966. The pace of Common Market
import expansion since late 1964 has equalled, and since last May has

IV -5
exceeded the largest year-over-year rate of increase shown by Common
Market imports in recent years, which was 13 per cent from 1962 to 1963.
German imports reached a peak last September which was not
surpassed in the five subsequent months, though after a sharp dip in
October the advance was resumed at a moderate pace. The one case in
Europe of a marked downturn in imports is that of Sweden, whose imports
fell almost continuously (to the year-end at least) after reaching a
peak in July.
The long awaited upturn in Japanese imports has now become
more clearly evident, with a sharp jump in February, possibly delayed
by the Japanese seamen's strike. For 1965 as a whole Japanese imports
were up only 3 per cent from 1964. In contrast, January-February 1966
imports were 10 per cent above those of the first two months of 1965.
British imports, which had been relatively level from last
spring until September or October, moved up to a new high in January-
February.
Data are not available on a seasonally adjusted basis to show
the sources from which the various countries have been drawing their
increased imports, except in the case of the United Kingdom. The expan-
sion of British imports since last autumn has been entirely from North
America (including, as we know, a sharp increase in purchases from the
United States) and Continental Europe.
Export statistics indicate marked accelerations in recent
months in the exports of Germany, Belgium, and the Netherlands. French
exports, on the other hand, have shown a considerably slower rise from

IV -6
last autumn up to the latest three-month period, December-February,
than France experienced earlier in 1965. An even more marked change
appears to have developed in Italian exports: their uptrend, which
was one of the most striking features of international trade during
1964 and the early months of 1965, came virtually to a halt after June --
though irregular month-to-month fluctuations cloud the picture somewhat.
A similar leveling off occurred in Japanese exports, also after strong
growth in 1964 and early 1965. However, in the latest three-month
period (December-February) Japanese exports have once again shown vigorous
expansion. (Distortions of Japanese export statistics due to the seamen's
strike are largely removed by combining December with the following two
months.)
The slowing in French and Italian export gains, coinciding
as it has with upturn or acceleration in those countries' imports,
reflects the growth of domestic demands described in recent Green Books.
To the extent that these countries are drawing their additional imports
from other Common Market countries, especially Germany, the effect is
to sustain the pressures of aggregate demand upon available resources
in the other countries.
Canadian exports, after rising moderately from mid-1964 to
mid-1965 (when Canadian imports were sharply expanding) advanced more
rapidly after last summer. Even so, with Canadian import expansion
also accelerating, the trade balance deteriorated further; seasonally
adjusted, exports fell short of imports in the fourth quarter for the
first time since early 1962. Over the past year Canada's trade deficit
with the United States especially has been rising; in relative terms
Canada's exports to us have not increased as rapidly as its exports elsewhere.

British exports, though fluctuating widely from month to
month of late, have registered significant gains. Paralleling what
happened on the side of British imports, the increase in exports from

IV -8
September-November to December-February was entirely in shipments
to Western Europe and North America. The U.K. trade deficit in these
last three months was at an annual rate of $0.5 billion (seasonally
adjusted balance of payments basis) compared with $0.7 billion in the
preceding three months or in the full year 1965.

APPENDIX A: SURVEY OF BANK LENDING PRACTICES, MARCH 1966*
The results of the seventh quarterly survey of changes in
bank lending practices are summarized in the following paragraphs and
accompanying tables. Reports were received from the 81 banks included
in the quarterly interest rate survey.
Over four-fifths of the respondents (67 out of 81 banks)
reported a firming of loan demand in the first quarter of this year
compared with the previous high of two-thirds in the last quarter of
1965. Moreover, in every aspect of lending policy, the number of banks
firming their policies was at record levels for the period since the
survey started (see Table 2). Only one bank (Minneapolis District)
reported easing any of its policies and this occurred only with respect
to intended use of loan proceeds and collateral required on business
loans.
With an increase in the prime rate in early March, it is not
surprising that every bank in the survey reported its policies were
firmer on interest rates to business borrowers (see Table 1). Most of
the respondents also firmed their requirements on compensating balances
as well as their policies on customer relationship considerations and
loans to new customers. Even for established customers over half of the
banks had firmer lending practices. Reflecting the tightness of the
situation, nearly two-thirds of the banks were less aggressive in seeking
new loans and almost as many were less willing to make term loans than
formerly. Perhaps reflecting in part the emphasis on making loans for
productive purposes in recent speeches by Randall (FDIC) and Treiber
(FRB NY), the largest increase over preceding quarters in the number of
banks firming policies related to intended use of loan proceeds.
Most respondents also adopted firmer policies on loans to
finance companies, particularly on interest rates and on the extension
of new or larger credit lines to such companies. More than half had
firmed policies on enforcement of balance requirements.
In explaining the firming of their policies, a number of
banks mentioned the increased cost of money in the form of time deposits
and their high loan/deposit ratios. Some banks reported that increased
difficulty in replacing maturing CD's also had been a contributing
factor. One large New York City bank stated that it was permitting a
moderate run-off of CD's because it preferred not to pay competitive
rates which it considered exorbitant.

of Research and Statistics.

Several banks mentioned that they were rationing credit.
Some were refusing to make loans for speculative purposes and one bank
stated that loan proceeds must be for "useful economic, productive pur-
poses". Several banks also pointed out that they were not taking on any
new finance company lines and they were attempting to avoid term loan
commitments.

APPENDIX B: PRODUCTION INDEX*
The question has been raised whether the industrial production
index currently may be overstating the rise in output because of the
productivity factors used to adjust the monthly manhour series in the
index. Any great overstatement in the manhour series, on average,
would clearly have a significant effect on the index, because these
series comprise half the total. The hypothesis of too much increase
for these series, moreover, seems to gain support from the fact that
these manhour series, as adjusted, on the whole are showing considerably
more rise in production than the other series,designated here as Q
series. It is clear, additionally, that in a period of high production
and strong pressure on available resources important forces are at work
tending to slow down increases in productivity; additional workers
taken in, for example, typically are less skilled and in many plants
the problem of getting products out and delivered assumes more impor-
tance than usual relative to the problem of getting the most output
per dollar of production cost. Finally, in thinking about measurement
problems, the difficulty of determining almost instantaneously just
exactly what is happening to productivity in any particular line is
evident for all to see. A discerning critic might argue that while it
is important to try to measure output in equipment and other lines for
which few relatively unambiguous measures are available, the manhour
figures as adjusted should be scrutinized and used with special care.
Does this all add up to a persuasive case for discounting
the 8 per cent rise in the index over the past year and especially the
18 per cent increase in equipment production, which is represented in
large part by manhour series? Those familiar with the history of the
index, with the methods by which it is currently compiled and with the
results shown by alternative approaches to measurement of output in the
industries represented by manhours will recognize that the case for
skepticism has been greatly overstated in the preceding paragraph;
no mention was made, for example, of the large volume of new labor
saving equipment already installed and now coming on stream for
effective use. Further, while no current figure can be expected to
correspond exactly to the final figures adjusted to Census benchmarks,
it can be shown (1) that the productivity factors for the manhour
series--practically all in the manufacturing component--are under
constant review, with special attention being given to their behavior
*--Prepared by Frank R. Garfield, Adviser, Division of Research and
Statistics, and Edward A. Manookian, Economist, Business Conditions
Section.

B -2
in relation to that in industries for which relatively unambiguous
production figures are available to compare with manhour figures;
(2) that the course of production shown by the adjusted manhour
series is fairly reasonable in the light of evidence in the form of
related data on shipments by manufacturers and on electric power
consumption; and (3) that the rise in industrial production has been
unusually rapid over the past year, almost irrespective of any
alteration one might reasonably choose to make in the productivity
factors affecting the manhour half of the index.
On (3) above, suppose the average productivity rise shown
should be reduced from the current reduced rate of about 3 per cent
per year to about 2 per cent--an action not advocated here--how much
would the course of the index be affected? It would show a rise of
7-1/2 per cent rather than 8 per cent over the past year; and an
average figure as low as 2 per cent for productivity increases in
the manhour area would be hard to justify. The equipment series,
moreover, have been showing so much more rise than the consumer
goods series and the materials series (both less heavily represented
by manhour series) that any change that might be made in productivity
factors would have little impact on the differences; the showing would
still be that output of equipment is rising very much faster than other
industrial output.
On (2) above, it may be noted that while the manhour series
as adjusted for productivity change have indicated a production rise
of 13 per cent for their half of the index over the past year, electric
power consumption in these same industries has risen 14 per cent. There
is a tendency for electric power consumption to rise a little more than
production but not enough to alter the substantial agreement these
figures suggest.
Considering (1) above, account is taken of a wide diversity
of rates of increase in output and productivity evident within both
the Q series and the MH series. The individual allowances used to
adjust the 60 series based on manhour data vary at present from 1-1/2
per cent per year for cereals and feeds up to 6 per cent in the case
of basic chemicals, averaging about 3 per cent. The productivity
factors for each manhour series over past years are derived from
annual indexes based primarily on independent product data. For the
current years, these factors are tentatively extrapolated in a smooth
line and the rate of increase is based, in part, on the past performance
of each series. But the implied changes in productivity for the whole
MH area are continuously checked against the implied productivity for
the total of the 150 Q series in the index. Any related data available
pertaining to various parts of the MH area are also used as checks.

B- 3
Dollar shipments data, for example, are studied. Eventually experience
gained in relating the Federal Reserve System's new data on electric
power used to the volume of output by these industries will provide
additional important current checks on rates of change in productivity
allowed for; already the electric power series are beginning to be use-
ful for this purpose, still presenting problems of interpretation but
not involving price adjustments for value series like shipments. After
review and checking the productivity are modified somewhat if it seems
necessary.
Despite the differences in composition in the Q series and
the MH series, over long periods rates of change in productivity for
these large groups have been about the same, with divergences occurring
in certain periods and years. A discussion of the relationship between
the Q series and MH series'for the years 1947 through 1959 is provided
in Industrial Production: 1959 Revision beginning on page 22.
Over the past five years, from 1960 to 1965, implied output
per manhour for the Q series rose 22.5 per cent and for the MH series
20.0 per cent. From 1964 to 1965, productivity implied for the Q
series rose 2.2 per cent and for the MH series 3.1 per cent. The
slower rate of increase in the Q series reflects atypical developments
in the steel and auto industries or in the statistics relating thereto,
as is discussed below. Productivity in the Q series excluding these
two industries increased 3.0 per cent from 1964 to 1965, about the same
as productivity in the MH area.
Month to month fluctuations in output per manhour in the Q
series, even after seasonal adjustment, tend to obscure the general
trend. For this reason the following table covering 1964 and 1965
compares quarterly averages shown for productivity in the total Q
series, the Q series excluding primary metals and motor vehicles, and
the MH series.

B-4
Even on a quarterly basis, the Q series show somewhat irregular
movements but the general upward trend is clearly revealed--through the
third quarter of 1965 for the total, and through the fourth quarter for
the total excluding primary metals and motor vehicles and parts. The
productivity factors shown for the NH series indicate a steady quarter
to quarter rise in this period and at the end of 1965 showed less in-
crease over early 1964 than is indicated for the Q series excluding
primary metals and motor vehicles.
Output per manhour in primary metals was unchanged, on the
average from 1964 to 1965. It increased in the first half of 1965,
when steel production rose rapidly, changed little in the third quarter,
and then declined sharply in the fourth quarter when steel output was
sharply curtailed after the September wage contract settlement.
Implied output per manhour for motor vehicles and parts has
shown an unusual decline since the second quarter of 1964. For 1965
as a whole it declined 1.3 per cent from 1964. This decline is probably
statistical only. In the September 1965 revision of the employment
data, implied productivity for this industry for the years 1961-1964
was raised appreciably; a similar revision in the 1965 data would
change the decline in productivity from 1964 to 1965 to a rise.
Reflecting in part a marked increase in steel production
from December to January the latest month for which there are fairly
reliable productivity data, output per manhour implied for the total Q
series increased sharply to a level above the third quarter average
while the productivity rise for the MH series was .25 per cent; as
noted earlier changes indicated in a single month are not necessarily
similar for the MH and Q series or very significant.
Whether and by how much in the period ahead installation of
new more efficient equipment at a rapid rate and various innovations
in production practices will more than offset factors operating to
reduce productivity are questions yet to be resolved. Unfortunately
there will be a time lag in answering these questions--good estimates
of changes in productivity in the Q series are two months late and the
irregular nature of the month to month fluctuations does not help in
signalling changes in trends. But the record of past developments
suggests that except for periods of dramatic change in production levels,
changes in the rate of productivity increase for any broad group of
industries occur only gradually. And in thinking about the total
production index changes from month to month it is to be remembered that
the current productivity allowances amount to only about 1/8 of one per
cent.

APPENDIX C:
ANNUAL FOREIGN TRADE BALANCES OF THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC COMMUNITY*
In 1965 the six Common Market countries had a sharply improved
trade balance with the world outside the trading bloc. On the balance-
of-payments basis (exports and imports both f.o.b.) the Community had an
increased trade surplus estimated at $2.2 billion, compared with roughly
$0.9 billion in 1964. As reported monthly, with insurance and freight
included in the import valuations (c.i.f.), the balance was a deficit,
but a much smaller one than in 1964. After narrowing sharply in the first
half of 1965, the trade deficit widened somewhat in the second half;
nevertheless, for the year as a whole it was only $1.70 billion, compared
with $2.66 billion in 1964.
EEC trade balance with the rest of the world
There have been two periods in the eight years since the Common
Market Treaty went into effect at the beginning of 1958 when the exports
of the area as a whole to non-member countries have grown faster than its
imports from outside the area. The first such period was in 1958-59.
The other began in 1964.
During 1958-59 the large trade deficits (imports valued c.i.f.)
of earlier years--which hit a peak of over $3 billion in 1957--turned to
surplus as exports grew moderately while imports leveled out below their
earlier peak. Major improvement in the trade balances of France (follow-
ing the franc devaluations of 1957 and 1958) and of Italy contributed to
this result. There followed two years of near balance in EEC trade accounts
vis-a-vis the outside world. Then, in 1962 and 1963, growth in Common
Market exports fell far short of the rise in imports--the latter mainly
reflecting booming economic expansion in all the courtries of the area--
and in 1963 a deficit of over $3 billion with the outside world was re-
corded. In 1964 and 1965, deficits diminished again--this time because
exports rose especially strongly compared with imports.
From 1963 to 1964 total exports to non-EEC destinations rose 12
per cent and from 1964 to 1965 they increased 11 per cent further. On the
other hand, total imports from non-members increased by 9 per cent in 1964
from 1963 and by an additional 6 per cent in 1965.

C- 2
Trade balances of individual members with non-members
The European Community's declining trade deficit with non-members
over the past two years has been due mainly to the shrinking Italian
deficit vis-a-vis non-EEC countries. However, from 1964 to 1965 the French
deficit with non-members also diminished.
In 1965 Italian exports to destinations outside the EEC were
8 per cent above 1964 levels. Although 1965 was a year of recovery from
recession in Italy, domestic demand continued at a reduced level, and ro-
bust foreign demand drew an increased volume of sales into the export
sector. Italian imports from third countries, on the other hand, fell
from 1963 to 1964; in 1965 imports for the year were unchanged from 1964
although they were increasing sharply during the course of the year. The
Italian trade deficit with the non-EEC world dropped from $1.8 billion in
1963 and $1.2 billion in 1964 to $860 million in 1965. (However, because
of sharply increased shipments to EEC partners, the overall Italian trade
balance was practically in balance for the year, in contrast with deficits
of $2.55 billion in 1963 and $1.27 billion in 1964.)
The improvement in the French deficit vis-a-vis non-EEC countries
from 1964 to 1965, like that for Italy, reflected the absence of any net
increase in French imports from non-members On the other hand, the rise
in French exports to the non-EEC world was 8 per cent, the same as for
Italy but lower than for the other member countries.
Exports and imports by major external areas
Among the Common Market's major marketing areas, the sharp
increase in exports to North America was the most prominent feature in
1965, compared with 1964 when exports to all external trading areas grew
pretty much in line with each other. Heavy consumer and investment demand
in the United States resulted in a 19 per cent increase in shipments to
the United States from the six countries of the EEC, a considerable jump
from the 11 per cent increase in 1964. EEC shipments to industrial Asia
and the developing parts of the world were also up sharply--almost 15 per
cent. On the other hand, exports to EPTA destinations grew more slowly
than in 1964, probably reflecting to some extent the impact of the import
surcharge in the United Kingdom.
In contrast, EEC purchases from the United States increased
only 3 per cent in 1965, down from 8 per cent in 1964 and less than
increases in purchases from other major trading areas.

C -3
Intra-EEC trade
Since 1958 intra-Market trade has grown at an average annual
rate of 15 per cent, which is much more than the 8 per cent average rise
in both exports to and imports from non-members. The 12 per cent growth
in internal Common Market trade from 1964 to 1965, however, was the low-
est annual increase since the beginning of the Community.
Italy's exports to EEC partners have registered the sharpest
gains in both of the past two years. They increased 27 per cent between
1963 and 1964 and a further 39 per cent between 1964 and 1965. Since
Italian imports from the area in 1965 totalled about the same as they had
in 1963, the Italian trade balance vis-a-vis the EEC countries improved
from a $720 million deficit in 1963 to a $670 million surplus in 1965.
French intra-EEC sales have also shown a pattern of vigorous
growth during the past two years. Between 1963 and 1964 they increased
13 per cent and between 1964 and 1965, 18 per cent.
On the other hand, in Germany booming economic expansion has
increased import demand sharply. Its 1964 imports from EEC partners were
18 per cent above 1963, and in 1965 its intra-EEC purchases skyrocketed 31
per cent above the previous year, Since sales to EEC destinations gained
more moderately during the same period, the German intra-EEC trade balance
turned from a surplus of $1.1 billion in 1963 to a deficit of $360 million
in 1965. This was the major factor responsible for the sharp decline in
the overall German trade surplus from $1.6 billion in 1963 to $310 million
in 1965.
Trade balance with imports valued f.o.b.
In 1964 the over-all trade balances of the EEC countries as
given in their balance of payments accounts showed a combined surplus of
about $0.9 billion. Imports in these accounts are valued exclusive of
insurance and freight charges, and there are various differences in
statistical coverage between the data used in the balance of payments and
the trade data reported monthly. The insurance and freight charges
appear to have averaged, for the Community as a whole, about 8 per cent
of the value of imports c.i.f. as reported in the monthly trade data
(i.e., with insurance and freight charges included).
For 1965 balance of payments statements are not yet available.
However, other things being equal, the improvement in the trade account
of the combined EEC balance of payments from 1964 to 1965 should be

C -4
greater by about $0.4 billion than the improvement in the monthly reported
trade data, imports c.i.f. (This estimate is based on applying an 8 per
cent insurance-and-freight ratio to the increase of about $5 billion in
total EEC imports.) Since the monthly trade data show an improvement of
$0.96 billion in the trade balance from 1964 to 1965, the improvement in
the balance of payments trade account may be estimated at $1.36 billion.
This would indicate that in 1965 the combined trade account of the EEC
countries as given in their balance of payments account should show a sur-
plus of about $2.2 billion.
