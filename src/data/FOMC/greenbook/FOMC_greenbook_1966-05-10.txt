SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK
Outlook for GNP
A further sharp advance in gross national product appears to
be taking place in the current quarter. The increase is unlikely to
match the $17 billion rise in the first quarter, largely because of
more moderate increases in food prices. In real terms, however, the
rise in over-all output should approximate the 6 per cent increase,
annual rate, achieved in the first quarter and contribute to continued
pressure on productive capacity and further reductions in available
manpower supplies.
Higher personal consumption expenditures, business fixed
investment and Federal expenditures are again proving to be the major
stimuli for expanding output and incomes. However, it is not likely
that the rapid first quarter advance in consumer expenditures will
be equalled. Expectations of a lower rate of spending reflect the
tapering off in food prices, which will tend to slow the rise in non-
durable goods expenditures. Also, early evidence that auto sales are
receding from the high first quarter rate suggests little change in
consumer purchases of durable goods this quarter.
Expenditures for fixed business investment should maintain
their strong upward momentum, as far as can be judged from recent order
data and special (albeit partial) surveys of businessmen's plans. No
cutback in business inventory accumulation is expected; indeed, any
further slowdown in automobile sales could push up inventories faster
than now projected for this quarter.

I-2
Another substantial rise in Federal outlays seems likely
for this quarter. Defense spending rose faster than anticipated in
Budget projections in the first quarter and estimated expenditures
for the current quarter also could be higher than indicated in the
January Budget. Beyond midyear there continues to be much uncer-
tainty. There is talk of reassessment of defense needs but no
confirmation has appeared in official quarters. Meanwhile, the
President last week issued a statement indicating that additions to
original Budget requests so far made or proposed by Congress would
add more than $3 billion to next fiscal year's nondefense expenditures.
Resource utilization and prices
A further rise in GNP such as described above will sustain
upward pressures on resource utilization and on prices. The unem-
ployment rate is expected to drift down from the 3.8 per cent of
March, and capacity utilization in manufacturing is likely to remain
near the 92 per cent rate of the first quarter.
Through the first quarter and perhaps in April as well,
industrial commodity prices rose at an annual rate of between 3 and
3.5 per cent--about midway between the 1.5 per cent of last year and
the 5.0 per cent of late 1955 and early 1956. The price rise is
likely to continue at a rate higher than last year, partly because

I- 3
increases have begun to appear for electrical machinery and some other
products that had been stable or declining. Labor costs per unit of
output in manufacturing have been edging up, and in the context of
generally strong demands, these cost increases are being translated
into higher prices and maintained or increased profit margins.
Contributing to the more rapid price advance this winter
was the steep rise in food prices. The peak in food prices, which
owed much more to curtailment of supplies than to expansion in
demands, probably was passed in February-March. Supplies are now
expanding again, and apart from a possible seasonal strengthening
in the early summer, food prices should decline and tend to limit
increases in the total indexes.
Outlook for deposits
The relatively rapid rate of expansion in time and savings
deposits at commercial banks since mid-March is likely to slow down
over coming months, but still remain above the reduced first quarter
rate. The slowdown will likely result from the tapering off of the
shifts that occurred at the time of the quarterly crediting of interest
on accounts at nonbank institutions, when many banks raised rates on
savings certificates and similar instruments. Inflows to commercial
banks in the months ahead are likely to be confined to time deposits,
as these instruments continue to be more attractive than bank savings
deposits or savings at other financial intermediaries.
Nonbank institutions are likely to find their inflows re-
duced below the first quarter rate; they may even find themselves
facing further net withdrawals, especially at the midyear interest-

I -4
crediting period. Furthermore, smaller banks may continue to lose
funds to larger banks, unless small banks compete more aggressively.
If credit demands and monetary policy are reflected in higher yields
on market instruments, the growth of claims on all financial institu-
tions, including banks, would be moderated further.
With respect to other deposits, the private money supply
over the remainder of the quarter is expected to show a considerably
reduced rate of growth relative to March and April, as Treasury
deposits rise in May and as banks liquidate assets acquired in April--
both as the result of repayment of temporary financings and sale of
liquid securities. Over the longer run, continuing large growth in
GNP should sustain transactions demands for cash, particularly if
interest rates remain at current levels in the face of rising credit
demands.
Credit demand
Total external financing needs of business remain large,
but loan demands at banks have been somewhat below earlier expectations.
Business loan expansion was relatively modest in April, and there is
increasing evidence of some bank loan repayment from the proceeds of
capital market financings. Banks earlier had tightened lending
standards and aggressively acquired time deposits, partly in antici-
pation of very large business loan demands, and when such loan demands
did not in fact materialize last month, banks increased their holdings
of relatively liquid securities, including Agency issues. As a result,
banks may have added a small cushion of liquidity that provides a
basis for accommodating future increases in loan demand.

I-5
Businesses have continued to rely heavily on capital markets
for their external financing, and this contributed to renewed upward
pressures on bond yields in April. Market expectations of a tax
increase also faded last month and increased monetary restraint was
generally assumed to be more likely. In the period immediately ahead
bond yields seem likely to continue to drift upwards.
Recent listings on the corporate public calendar for May
and June and reports of private placement activity among underwriters
both suggest that new corporate security offerings in the second
quarter will continue large. In the municipal bond market, current
demands for funds also remain strong, with the major question continuing
to be to what extent prospective borrowers may be priced out of the
market, at least temporarily. The last minute build up in the April
municipal calendar--and the fact that some of the issues postponed
in February and March have since been financed--suggests that if
interest rates decline, borrowers in the market may seize the oppor-
tunity to finance. While the Federal Government will not be a sig-
nificant factor in securities markets through its direct debt, there
are indications that very sizable amounts of new cash will be raised
through Agency issues over the next several weeks.

I-6
Balance of payments
The payments deficit on the liquidity basis turns out to
have been at a $2 billion annual rate during the first quarter--
higher than previously estimated and a little above the $1.8 billion
rate in the second half of 1965. At annual rates, the merchandise
trade surplus was $1/2 billion smaller than in the preceding half
year but reflows of bank credit were about $1/2 billion larger. The
outflow of U.S. capital into new foreign security issues increased,
owing mainly to postponement of Canadian issues from late 1965 to
early 1966. On all other transactions that affect the liquidity
deficit,taken together--military and service transactions, direct
investment, and Government aid--there appears to have been little
net change from the second half of 1965 to the first quarter of this
year. There was, however, a marked shift in flows of foreign liquid
funds from abnormal outflow to large inflow; this shift reduced the
rate of deficit calculated on the basis of official reserve transactions
from about $2 billion in the second half of 1965 to about $1 billion
in the first quarter of 1966.
Weekly data indicate that in April the rate of deficit on
either basis of calculation was at least as large as during the first
quarter.
For the period ahead, changes in the trade surplus will
probably dominate the change in the over-all position. Changes in
other current transactions seem likely to be roughly offsetting, with

I-7
increases in military expenditures abroad roughly matching increases
in investment income. There is little prospect of further sizable
reduction in the net outflow of either U.S. Government capital or
U.S. private capital, and increases are a possibility. Even if
direct investment outflows decline a little between the year 1965
and the year 1966, they are likely to be at a higher rate than in
the second half of 1965.
The merchandise trade surplus diminished from the fourth
quarter to the first, as imports increased 4 per cent while exports
rose only 1 per cent. Over the next few months, further rapid ex-
pansion of imports is to be expected as domestic demand rises. The
first quarter increase was concentrated in autos and parts, aircraft,
and machinery. There was no increase in imports of steel (now back
to late-1964 levels), petroleum and products, or other industrial
supplies--groups that accounted for nearly half of total imports in
1965 and that normally advance rapidly during periods of strong
domestic demand pressure. Also coffee imports may turn up soon, since
U.S. inventories of coffee have been drawn down to low levels.
Demand conditions abroad are generally buoyant, in less
developed countries as well as in industrial countries. But whether
U.S. exporters will be able to take advantage of these conditions may
depend increasingly on domestic developments in this country. Given
the strength of domestic demand now foreseen for the months ahead, there
remains a clear danger that the trade surplus and the over-all pay-
ments position will deteriorate.

THE ECONOMIC PICTURE IN DETAIL
The Nonfinancial Scene
Gross national product. Economic activity is continuing to
expand very strongly in the current quarter, but the increase in
gross national product is not expected to equal the exceptionally
large -- $17 billion -- rise posted in the first quarter. We are now
estimating the second quarter at $729 billion, a rise of $15 billion or
8.3 per cent, annual rate, compared with 9.7 per cent in the first quarter.
More of the rise in GNP is expected to be in real output,
and less in prices. Real GNP in the current quarter is expected to
advance at close to the 6 per cent, annual rate, achieved in the first
quarter. Prices (GNP implicit deflator) are projected to increase at
an annual rate of 2.8 per cent as compared with 3.6 per cent in the
first quarter reflecting less increase in food prices.
Increased personal consumption expenditures, fixed business
investment and Federal spending again should make the major contributions
to expansion in GNP. Consumer outlays are estimated to rise by a little
under $9 billion, somewhat less than the $11.5 billion in the preceding
quarter. Recent consumer-buying surveys and automobile sales in
April both suggest a lower rate of auto sales. Durable consumer goods
expenditures are now projected at about the first quarter level. The
expected slowing in the rise of consumer food prices should moderate
the current dollar increases in nondurable goods spending. Outlays

I -2
for services, however, are expected to continue to push upward in
line with past trends.
Increases in consumption expenditures in the current quarter
will be a little less than the large further rise projected for disposable
income and the savings rate should increase slightly from the reduced
first quarter rate. In the first quarter, the sharp rise in retail food
prices and the increase in social security taxes were reflected in an
appreciable decline in the savings rate.
No let-down is anticipated from the high rate of expansion in
business fixed investment in the first quarter when plant and equip-
ment outlays proved to be about in line with the plans reported in the
McGraw-Hill March survey which called for an increase of 19 per cent
for the year 1966. In the light of this survey and a resurvey by
Lionel Edie (confidential), we have projected the increase in business
fixed investment in the second quarter to be about the same amount as
the first quarter.
Residential construction outlays are expected to decline
moderately in the second quarter, reflecting a lower average number of
housing starts in the first quarter. Business inventory investment
is projected to rise slightly in the second quarter.
Defense spending registered a very large advance in the first
quarter, $3 billion or almost $1 billion more than had been estimated
on the basis of the January Budget. We now expect another sizable
increase, possibly around $2 billion, in the second quarter on the

II -3
assumption that the spending momentum will continue and carry outlays
above the relatively high March level. Other Federal purchases and
State and local government expenditures are projected to rise slightly
faster than in the first quarter.
Commerce GNP estimates -- First Ouarter. Preliminary Commerce
estimates lifted gross national product to an annual rate of $714
billion in the first quarter. This rise -- $17 billion -- was the
largest since the Korean War. It also included the sharpest increase
in the implicit price deflator since the Korean War; a third of the increase
in dollar volume represented higher prices. Real GNP in the first
quarter increased at an annual rate of 6 per cent, exceptionally large
in view of the current high rate of plant utilization and sharply reduced
manpower supplies.

Personal consumption expenditures rose $11.5 billion, or
at an annual rate of 10.5 per cent; in real terms, the gain was about

II -4
7 per cent. The increase was heavy for both durable and nondurable
goods. Sales of automobiles and household durables were extremely
high and the more rapidly rising food prices were reflected in larger-
than-expected gains in nondurable goods. Outlays for services rose
about in line with earlier trends.
The large rise in personal consumption expenditures exceeded
the rise in disposable income, and the ratio of personal saving to
disposable income declined to 4.8 per cent from 5.6 per cent.
Both residential construction and business fixed invest-
ment increased markedly in the first quarter. The rise in residential
activity reflected the surge in new housing starts at the end of last
year. The rise in business plant and equipment investment raised total
fixed investment to 10.6 per cent of gross national product, a higher
proportion than in 1965 and about the same as at the peak reached in
the third quarters of 1956 and 1957. In constant prices business fixed
investment in the first quarter was a larger share of total real product --
10.9 per cent -- than at any time since 1950.
1/ If, however, personal income in the first quarter were adjusted
to exclude the increase in social security taxes due to lifting the
wage base -- a deduction which actually does not affect actual
consumers' first quarter income, the ratio of savings to income would
have been 5.1 per cent.

Industrial production. Industrial production increased 1 per
cent further in March and was 8.7 per cent above a year earlier.
Incomplete production data for April suggest a further increase in
industrial activity, although probably by a smaller amount than in
March.
Annual rates of increase in industrial output from the fourth
quarter of 1965 to the first quarter of 1966, shown in the table, were
exceptionally large considering that in the fourth quarter capacity
utilization in manufacturing was already very high. The total index
rose at an annual rate of 12.8 per cent as compared with 8.5 per cent
for the year period ending with the first quarter of 1966.
Materials production increased at an annual rate of 15 per
cent from the fourth quarter of 1965 to the first quarter of 1966 and
accounted for more than three-fifths of the increase in the total index.

Output increases were widespread in durable and nondurable materials
in this period and the rise in output of iron and steel, recovering from
the curtailed fourth quarter level, was particularly fast. From March
to April steel ingot output was about unchanged but still 6 per cent
above the advanced first quarter average.
Inventories of steel mill products held by consuming manu-
facturers declined further in February, the latest month available, and
at the end of the month were 35 per cent below the August 1965 peak.
Partially offsetting, inventories at steel mills increased 15 per cent
in the same period. At the high steel production rates of March-April
it is believed that over-all steel inventories were rising.
Output of consumer durables goods showed an exceptional gain
between the fourth and first quarters, but the rise is now likely to
slow down. Output of defense equipment will, most probably, continue
to show large gains. However, because of its relatively small importance
of such equipment in the total index, a rise at the rapid annual rate
of 31 per cent contributed only 0.3 percentage points to the increase
in the total index between the fourth and first quarters.
Retail sales. In April retail sales apparently receded from the
very advanced level in March, owing in part to unfavorable weather in
most areas of the country. The March level of sales was 3.3 per cent
above the end of 1965 and 12 per cent above a year earlier. Sales of
new U.S.-made autos in April dropped. Sales at furniture and appliance
stores and at lumber, building materials and hardware stores were
off sharply. The weekly data suggest that total sales at

II -8
nondurable goods stores changed little, with declines at apparel, general
merchandise, and eating and drinking establishments about offset by
sizable increases at food stores.
Unit auto sales and stocks. Deliveries of domestic autos
fell sharply in the first 20 days of April, and although they picked up
in the final 10 days, deliveries for the month fell to a 7.8 million
annual rate and were about 15 per cent below the peak rate in the first
quarter and 5 per cent below April 1965. Three developments probably
contributed to the April decline. The reimposition in March of the one
percentage point excise tax was used as a promotional device and this
may have caused some bunching of sales in the first quarter. Total
sales of domestic cars then were an annual rate of 9.3 million compared
with 8.6 in the fourth quarter of last year. Sales in April may also
have been adversely affected by publicity given to auto safety con-
siderations and by factory recalls of a number of cars to adjust faulty
parts or assembly.
Auto producers so far have acted as though they expect a
strong selling season this spring. Production was briefly curtailed
by the railroad strike but then was raised again in late April to
near-peak rates of about 210,000 per week -- a seasonally adjusted annual
rate of more than 9 million. Thus dealer stocks have continued to
increase, reaching a level 30 per cent above both a year ago and two
years ago.

II -9
Consumer credit. Renewed vigor in consumer credit activity
is indicated for March. The borrowing pace had slowed in January
and still further in February to the point where the rise in outstanding
instalment debt in the latter month was the smallest in over a year.
Despite the faster tempo in March, the increase in instalment credit
for the first quarter as a whole was substantially less than for most
quarters in 1965.-1

1/ Revised series.
The slower credit growth in January and February was
centered in the auto area; borrowing to finance household goods and
personal needs continued to increase about as usual. The turnaround in
March appears also to have been mainly in autos but with household goods
credit also moving up vigorously.
1/ These comparisons are based on revised data. The commercial bank
sector of the consumer credit estimates has been adjusted to call
reports for June and December 1964 and June 1965. The revision has
raised the level of total instalment debt on a gradually increasing
basis throughout the period July 1963 to date, with the adjustment
reaching a maximum of about $1 billion last June. However, short-term
movements in the series remain much the same as before.

II -10
Manufacturers' new and unfilled orders. New orders received
by manufacturers of durable goods rose sharply further in March. Large
increases were registered by all industry groupings, except iron
and steel. In the first quarter, new orders to durable-goods manu-
facturers were 5.5 per cent higher than in the final three months of
1965 and 12 per cent higher than in the first quarter of last year.
Orders for durable goods have increased by progressively larger amounts
in each of the past four quarterly periods.

Unfilled orders of durable goods producers in March were 2
per cent higher than a month earlier, as new orders continued to exceed
shipments. Unfilled orders of all major industry groups rose, with the
largest increases in the primary metals industry.
Manufacturers' inventories and shipments. Factory stocks
increased by $640 million (book value) in March, a little more than the
January-February average. For the first quarter as a whole, factory
inventory accumulation amounted to $1,660 million, close to the $1,750
million of the fourth quarter. The first quarter 1966 increase

II -11
in inventories sharply exceeded producer anticipations in February.
At that time producers anticipated a second-quarter buildup of only
$1,300 million.
Manufacturers' shipments in March were up 3 per cent from
February, which was little changed from the month before, and 9 per
cent from a year ago. In the recent rise, shipments of defense products,
machinery, and consumer durables have been particularly important.
Construction activity. The value of new construction activity
put in place, which had tended up since last autumn, dipped in March
to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $75 billion. This was slightly
below the record level reached in February, according to preliminary
estimates. (Such estimates in some previous months have been revised
later by substantial amounts.)
Over the first quarter, the record pace of new construction
was highlighted by a further advance in private nonresidential outlays.
During the past four quarters, about half the rise in the value of all
types of construction apparently reflected higher costs.

Private housing starts as well as private building permits
turned up in March after declining in the two preceding months.
Although month-to-month changes were quite sharp during the first quarter,
the three-month averages for both starts and permits ran only a little
below the advanced rates reached in the fourth quarter of 1965 and were
at the same level as for the year 1965. In view of recent develop-
ments in home mortgage markets, a lower volume of residential
construction seems very likely in coming months.
Plans for fixed capital spending. The McGraw-Hill survey
in March found plant and equipment outlays planned for this year by all
business up 19 per cent from last year, compared with the 16 per cent
indicated by the Commerce-SEC survey taken a month or so earlier.
Both surveys were taken before the President made his appeal to business
to postpone or stretch-out capital.outlay programs. A subsequent
recheck by Lionel Edie (received on a confidential basis) found that,
although some firms cut back, total business plans were unchanged from
his February survey.
If the increase in capital outlays should be limited by
postponement of projects to amounts below those planned, then presumably
inflationary pressures would be less than otherwise, both because
expenditures and income would be less and because the increase in un-
filled orders would not be so large. If the increase in spending should
be limited by shortages and if unfilled orders in these circumstances

II -13
accumulate rapidly, the only easing effect would be through the spending-
income flow and that might be limited by price advances.
The McGraw-Hill and the most recent Commerce-SEC survey results
are shown in the following table.

Step-ups in planned spending by primary metals and electrical
machinery industries account for most of the relatively larger increase
shown by the McGraw-Hill survey for manufacturing. Increases were also
larger for some nondurable goods industries, mainly those producing
materials for further processing.
According to the McGraw-Hill survey, manufacturers were
operating at 90 per cent of capacity at the end of 1965 (no data are
given for current rates of utilization) and, on average, now consider
93 per cent of capacity as the most desirable operating rate as compared

II -14
with the 92 per cent they reported when last surveyed in 1962.-
Manufacturing capacity is expected to increase 8 per cent this year
compared with 7 per cent last year, which itself was revised up from
6 per cent projected a year ago. Manufacturers also expect their sales
to rise by 8 per cent this year.. Thus, even if the larger increase in
capacity is achieved, utilization rates would remain very high.
With manufacturers operating plants at higher rates than at
any time in recent years, the need for expanding capacity continues
pressing. As a result, the proportion of new investment going to expand
facilities has been increased to 48 per cent from 45 per cent last year
and only about one-third between 1959 and 1964.
For the first time, McGraw-Hill asked its survey respondents
to indicate the major factors which might cause actual expenditures
to fall short of planned spending. The two major reasons given were
delays in equipment deliveries (34 per cent) and construction delays
(27 per cent). Labor shortages (only 9 per cent), high interest rates
(only 5 per cent), and material shortages (only 4 per cent) were con-
sidered less important.
The labor market. With demands for labor continuing exceptionally
strong and with the unemployment rate continuing to drift down, available
supplies of workers with recent job experience have become stringent.
l/ These rates are conceptually a little different than those cal-
culated by FRB. Roughly 2 points should be added to the McGraw-Hill
figures to make them comparable to FRB.

II -15
Increasingly, new entrants into the labor force -- mostly young people
and adult women -- are becoming the predominant source of additional
labor. For experienced workers receiving unemployment compensation
benefits, unemployment rates have declined to the lowest levels since
World War II.
The number of persons filing new claims for unemployment
benefits declined from March to April -- to the smallest for the period
since World War II -- reflecting further reductions in lay-off rates
throughout industry and the apparent speed with which laid-off workers
have found other jobs.

The number of persons receiving unemployment benefits also declined

are now receiving unemployment benefits -- the lowest rate in the post-
war period. In April 1953 the rate was 2.5 per cent.

II -16
Earnings and labor costs. Hourly earnings in manufacturing
in March rose slightly further, to a level 3.5 per cent above a year
ago, and reflecting the effect of longer hours worked at premium pay,
total weekly earnings were up 4.2 per cent. After adjustment for the
rise in consumer prices, the increase in total real earnings was reduced
to 1.4 per cent and was substantially less than the increase in real
earnings in 1965.
For workers with three dependents, after tax spendable
earnings have increased 2.6 per cent over the past year -- less than half
as much as in the previous year. Partly, the slow-up this year re-
flects the recent rise in social security taxes, whereas the year before
spendable earnings had benefited from tax reductions.

When consumer price increases are also taken into account,
the real weekly spendable earnings of factory workers with 3 dependents
have not increased in the past year. The recent leveling off in
purchasing power defined in this way is in contrast to earlier years
of the expansion, when prices were rising less rapidly. Lack of

II -17
improvement in the purchasing power of take-home pay this past year has
occurred despite the record workweek put in by production workers. In
the months ahead, if retail food prices stabilize or decline as expected,
real earnings are likely to turn up again.
Somewhat lower productivity gains and increased social
security taxes have been the major factors pushing up unit labor costs
this year. In March, labor costs in manufacturing were .5 per cent
above the January level and .7 per cent above a year ago. Over the year,
the rise in labor costs has been less than the rise in industrial prices.
Looking ahead, unions can be expected to demand larger wage
increases, pointing to rising consumer prices, wholesale price rises
in excess of increases in unit labor costs, and higher profits as reasons
why wage gains should exceed the guidepost in contract reopenings this
year. The effect of these increased demands will become more evident
later this year when an increasing number of important negotiations will
get underway, such as the electrical workers.
Wholesale prices. Industrial commodity prices apparently
continued to rise in April at the accelerated pace of the first quarter
of this year. Prices of foodstuffs declined appreciably further, however,
with the result that the total wholesale price index remained at about
the advanced February-March level. At that level, the index is about
5 per cent higher than in the 1958-1964 period. While the sharp rise
in foodstuffs since 1964, amounting to more than 10 per cent, has
accounted for a disproportionately large share of the increase in the
total, industrial commodity prices have increased about 3 per cent.

II -18
A third of that 3 per cent increase in industrial commodities
has occurred since the beginning of this year, when the rise accelerated
to an annual rate of between 3.0 and 3.5 per cent from the 1.5 per cent
rate prevailing from September 1964 through 1965. Much of the speed-up
reflects machinery and equipment prices, which increased 1.1 per cent
in the first quarter compared with 1.7 per cent in all of 1965.
While several categories of nonelectrical machinery have been rising
faster this year than last, a major feature of the acceleration is the
upturn in electrical machinery. The electrical group rose 1.5 per cent
in the first quarter, after having been stable in 1965 and having declined
in the preceding 5 years, and press reports indicate a continuation of
the rise in April.
Copper products were rising rapidly again in the first quarter;
the total nonferrous group increased 3 per cent after having declined
somewhat from November to December when prices of copper and some
products were rolled back following an announcement of an emergency
release of supplies from the strategic stockpile and the imposition of
export controls on scrap. In the first quarter, the copper shortage
intensified, in part because of a 28-day strike in Chile, and prices
soared on the London Metal Exchange to 95 cents a pound, compared with
the 36 cents maintained by U.S. primary producers. In late April, the
Chilean Government raised its price, up to 62 cents from 42 cents a pound,
in part to recover foreign exchange earnings lost during the strike, and
Zambian producers retruned to their practice of some years ago of tying
their price to the forward contract on the London Exchange. At the time

II -19
of these actions, the forward contract was quoted at 78.5 cents a pound;
it subsequently fell to 61 cents but then recovered to 69 cents. These
increases in producer prices for primary copper are almost certain to
bring about a change in the allocation of supplies and a reduction in
the over-all amount demanded. U.S. users continue to receive roughly
two-thirds of their copper at the domestic price of 36 cents.
Prices of steel mill products, according to the BLS index,
continued to edge up slowly in the first quarter and are 1.5 per cent
higher than a year ago. Production of steel has recovered sharply from
the low reached last November, after the threat of a strike had passed.
At current output rates, not much more than 5 per cent below the ad-
vanced levels of last spring and summer, inventories probably are being
increased, but in general, supplies are readily available and new orders
appear to have leveled off while unfilled orders are still relatively
low. The absence of strong demand pressures in this industry is suggested
also by some weakening recently in prices for steel scrap.
Among industrial commodities other than metals and machinery,
price increases have become somewhat more numerous but are still
limited. Lumber and products have increased appreciably -- in response,
reportedly, to Government buying, the threat of strikes, and a shortage
of freight cars -- and a few other building materials have risen.
Hides and leather products are sharply higher than at the end of last
year, but hide prices have been declining since early March in association
with Government action to limit exports to the total in 1964. Increases

II -20
in paperboard and some converted paper products have raised the paper
group average about 1 per cent since December. An increase of about 5
per cent in cigarette prices was reflected in the March index, but part
of this increase was subsequently rescinded. Reports of price increases
among industrial chemicals have been more numerous this year, but the index
was a little lower in March than in December. Fuels have declined some-
what, mainly as a result of seasonal influences. Prices of furniture
have been raised, but other consumer durable goods generally have re-
mained stable.
Wholesale prices of foodstuffs turned down in March, and by
late April they averaged about 2.5 per cent below the February high.
From their peaks in February, prices of livestock have declined 8 per
cent and those of meats 4 per cent. In the latter part of April,
production of meat, particularly beef, increased appreciably. Expansion
in marketing may have been stimulated by Government and other state-
ments of prospective price declines and by release of the report on
the number of cattle on feed as of April 1, which pointed to marketings
of cattle in the May-September period somewhat larger than previously
expected. Prospects for expansion in pork and poultry supplies as well
may be encouraging reduction in cold storage stocks of meats. In
April, prices of eggs and dairy products also declined, but the decreases
were mainly seasonal and left prices substantially higher than last
spring. Decreases for livestock and products were partially offset by
larger-than-seasonal increases in prices of fruits and vegetables.

II -21
Consumer prices. The consumer price index showed another
sizable increase in March, with foods again accounting for half or more
of the rise. After increaseing .6 per cent in February, the index rose
.4 per cent in March to 112.0 of the 1957-59 average and was 2.8 per cent
higher than a year earlier.
Food prices generally rose in March and the average increased
.7 per cent further, for a cumulative increase of 3.0 per cent since
December and 6.5 per cent from March a year ago. Although average prices
of meats rose somewhat further, to a level nearly a fifth above a year
earlier, pork prices turned down. Retail prices of beef as well as pork
may have declined in April.
Prices of nonfood commodities increased .2 per cent in March.
The year-to-year rise of .8 per cent was about in line with the trend
rate of increase evident since 1958, but the increase would have been
larger had not excise taxes been reduced. Over the past year, increases
have been concentrated in nondurable goods, particularly clothing and
footwear. Durables generally have declined, but the decreases are largely
accounted for by the excise-tax reductions.
Services rose .3 per cent in March to a level 2.6 per cent
above March 1965. Since last fall services have been rising faster than
the 2 per cent annual rate of increase earlier in this expansion. Medical
care services account for much of the acceleration, and they may rise
more sharply with the midyear inauguration of benefits under Medicare.

II -22
Agricultural supply and price situation. Increasing supplies
of high protein foods during the rest of the year now seem assured
following the very tight situation in the first quarter. In
reappraising supply prospects for the rest of 1966, USDA analysts
have raised their projections of poultry meat, pork, and beef by small
amounts. Average prices received by farmers for meat animals, already
down 4 per cent from March to April because of increased marketings,
are expected to decline further.
The April 1 report showing 13 per cent more cattle on feed
than a year ago raised supply prospects and lowered price prospects
for fed cattle for the next two quarters, at least. Feeders intend
to market 12 per cent more cattle in the second quarter than a year
earlier--a gain of 4 to 5 per cent over the relatively large marketings
of the first quarter. This expansion is expected to keep prices of
choice steers (Chicago) in the current range of $26 to $27, which
is down from the $29 to $30 quoted in March and early April and
about the same as last autumn.
Hog marketings are expected by late May to exceed those of
a year ago and by the fourth quarter of 1966 to be up as much as 12
per cent. The usual summer rise in hog prices will probably be small
and autumn prices could fall a little more than seasonally to $18 to
$19, a decline of around $10 from January and February.
A sharp expansion in production of broilers and turkeys is
also in progress. Supplies of poultry meat are expected to exceed year
earlier levels by 10 per cent in the second and third quarters, and

II -23
the year-to-year gain in supplies in the fourth quarter will be about
8 per cent, unless growers cut back broiler production in response to
price weakness in the late summer. Prices of broilers are expected to
remain above year earlier levels through early summer or until pork
and turkey marketings gain momentum. Egg production by the fourth
quarter will be significantly above year earlier levels. Milk pro-
duction in the first quarter,down 5 per cent from a year earlier, is
expected to increase in the latter part of the year, reflecting improved
pasture conditions and the April 1 increase of 8 per cent in the
support price.
Fresh vegetables are being marketed now in increasing volume
following the reduced supplies caused by bad weather earlier in the
season. Total spring tonnage is expected to be well above last year.
Potatoes, in particular, will be in more ample supply. Canners and
freezers are planning big packs of vegetables in 1966. Farmers planting
intentions indicate that, with average yields, vegetables grown for
processing may equal the record output of 1962.
Farm income. Farm incomes benefited from sharply higher
prices received in the first quarter. Cash receipts averaged 17 per
cent above the low first quarter of 1965. Increases were much greater
in areas specializing in livestock.
The USDA has estimated that cash receipts of farmers in 1966
will be around $2 billion above the $38.9 billion of 1965. Marketings
of livestock and products are expected to be up slightly and prices
for the year are expected to average above 1965 despite expected

II -24
declines in average prices in the second half of the year. Volume of
crop marketings is expected to exceed 1965 if the growing season is
normal and prices are expected to average lower than in 1965. Cash
receipts from marketings of cotton will be down substantially re-
flecting the effects of the new cotton program provisions calling for
retirement of acreage and a 29 per cent reduction in the loan rate
for cotton to 21 cents per pound, approximately the world price.
Growers will receive compensating payments.
Government payments to farmers are projected to exceed the
$2.5 billion of 1965 by about $1 billion reflecting mainly higher
payments on wheat and the addition of up to $500 million in diversion
and price support payments to the cotton farmers. The termination
of subsidy payments by the Commodity Credit Corporation to cotton
users and exporters will offset much of the rise in payments to
cotton farmers.
Farmers are apparently borrowing more heavily for production
expenses than a year earlier, judging by PCA lending activity. Cash
advances to farmers by PCA's were up 27 per cent in the first quarter
from a year earlier and loans outstanding at the end of March were 15
per cent above a year earlier. Increases in borrowing from the PCA's
occurred in all areas of the country but were largest in the cattle
feeding areas.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL SITUATION
Funds raised in credit markets. Preliminary figures on
credit flows in the first quarter indicate a total borrowing rate,
seasonally adjusted, of about $90 billion dollars, well above even
the high rate of $84 billion in the fourth quarter of last year. The
increase occurred in both private and Federal Government borrowing.
The increase in total busines-s and household borrowing, from
a $60 billion rate to $63-1/2 billion, appears to have been about in
line with the increases in investment spending and purchases of
consumer durable goods, which together were $4 billion higher than
the preceding quarter on a gross basis and $2 billion higher measured
net of capital consumption allowances. The first quarter relationship
of borrowing to investment is close to that of the preceding five
years. But businesses were exceptionally large borrowers in capital
markets during the first quarter. Within the private total, corporate
net bond issues, at a $13 billion annual rate for nonfinancial
corporations, were well above the previous peak rate of $8 billion
last summer and higher than any quarter since 1952 even after allowance
for growth of the economy.
State and local government security issues were slightly down
from the fourth quarter after seasonal adjustment, but both the fourth
and first quarters, at an $8-$10 billion rate of net new issues, were
high historically, particularly in view of the growth over the last

III -2
year in the net surplus of state and local governments as estimated
in the income-and-product accounts.
While the rate of Federal borrowing in direct debt was also
down somewhat from the fourth quarter, agency issues and loan partici-
pation certificates were sufficient to put the total of credit-market
funds raised by the Federal government about $3 billion higher
at annual rates. Much of this increase in agency borrowing was
offset by expanded Federal lending activities, particularly in
mortgages.

III -3
Recent bank credit flows. Preliminary estimates indicate
a large seasonally adjusted increase in bank credit during April--
almost half again as large as the average income of the first three
months of the year. On a daily average basis, the increase in bank
credit at member banks is indicated to have been at an 18 per cent
annual rate. But because of a large increase the last week of March
and some repayments the end of April, the end of month credit series
indicates a seasonally adjusted annual rate of growth only slightly
above the 11.3 per cent rate of March. While changing seasonal
patterns for April suggest that undue emphasis should not be placed
on the April figures, it appears clear that loans and investments
at banks expanded quite rapidly throughout most of the month.
Business loans rose only moderately in April, at near the
reduced February pace of an 11 to 12 per cent annual rate, compared
to a 19.6 per cent rate of the first quarter, and, as a whole, they
showed no particular strength during the week of the April tax date.
However, large loan repayments from the proceeds of capital market
financings by two corporations totaled over $300 million; these
repayments alone had the effect of reducing the annual rate of growth
of aggregate business loans at banks during the month by about 5 per-
centage points.
The April corporate tax payment of approximately $2.5 billion
generated little pressure on banks to make direct loans to businesses.

III -4
Instead firms apparently had funded these liabilities in advance--via
holdings of Treasury issues, RP's, finance company paper, and CD's.
Thus, in the week of the tax date, when such assets were liquidated
by businesses and when dealer and finance company borrowings from
corporations was reduced, banks absorbed bills and made large loans
to dealers and finance companies rather than stepping up their direct
lending to businesses. The following week, in New York, dealer and
broker loans, as well as security holdings by banks, were reduced
as some of the financial assets liquidated by businesses to pay tax
liabilities were shifted by banks to still other holders. Thus,
on an end-of-month basis, total bank loans rose only about one-half
as rapidly in April as in March.
Bank holdings of securities, however, reversed recent
trends and increased by nearly $1 billion in April, offsetting two-
thirds of the first quarter decline. This increase apparently occurred
mainly at city banks, with a very large share accounted for by New
York City banks. Smaller banks, unlike most of the first quarter,
are believed to have added little to their holdings of securities.
The growth in security portfolios at city banks, and the modest
growth at other banks, is directly tied to the composition of deposit
inflows, as described below.
Most of the $300 million increase in banks holdings of
Governments in April was in bills, reflecting acquisition from corporate
customers over the tax period, and perhaps also efforts of banks to

III -5
rebuild liquidity. The sharp increase in other security holdings
probably stems in large part from acquisitions of the new issue of
$650 million of New York State tax anticipation bills and several
issues of new Federal agency issues and participation certificates
which totaled over $1.6 billion. While no firm data are available,
the latter issues likely account for a large part of April's
seasonally adjusted increased bank holding of other securities.
The increase in bank credit in April was accompanied by
a 14 per cent annual rate of growth in the money stock, following
an 8.6 per cent rate of increase in March. While seasonal problems
suggest that the April rate of growth may be overstated, it seems
clear that the private money stock rose sharply in the first half
of April and more slowly thereafter. Part of this recent growth
reflects reductions of Treasury balances in March and mid-April,
but System operations designed to permit banks to finance tax
pressures seemed to contribute relatively more to this increase,
with nonborrowed reserves expanding at an annual rate in excess of
13 per cent last month. If tax date liquidation of assets by cor-
porations and sales of large quantities of Federal agency obligations
had been forced through the market, it would undoubtedly have entailed
increasing market yields; System operations permitted banks directly
or indirectly to acquire a large portion of these assets. Not only
did this reduce pressure on market yields and sharply increase bank
credit growth, but, in addition, the absorption of such assets by
banks was reflected in an increase in demand deposits.

III -6
Flows of saving. On the supply side of credit markets, there
was a marked shift from the fourth quarter of 1965 to the first quarter
of 1966 in the pattern of flows. The reduced growth between the two
quarters in money supply, time deposits, and savings accounts of all
types was reflected in a drop in lending by commercial banks and
nonbank, financial institutions from an exceptionally high $70 billion
seasonally adjusted annual rate in the fourth quarter to no more
than a $50 billion rate in the first. During the past month, inflows
of funds to commercial banks accelerated, but nonbank institutions
apparently experienced larger than seasonal withdrawals of funds, as
best can be judged from partial data thus far available.
The drop in institutional flows during the first quarter of
1966 reflected a transfer of funds by the public into direct purchases
of market instruments in a period of rising market interest rates.
Such direct purchases appear to have been at more than a $30 billion
annual rate during the first quarter, an unprecedented high in the
postwar period.
There were large purchases of all types of instruments,
particularly Federal securities, municipal issues, corporate bonds,
and finance company paper. State and local governments appear to
have been a major source of funds to the Federal securities market,
relative to the fourth quarter, probably reflecting reinvestment of
proceeds of their own capital market financing. Households also

III -7
increased their purchases of Governments while maintaining their
fourth-quarter flow into municipals and supplying a large part of the
funds to the heavy volume of corporate bond issues during the quarter.
With finance companies turning sharply to the open market for funds,
corporations appear to have put much of their liquidity growth into
finance company paper, with some increase in time deposits and little
change in holdings of Government securities.
With respect to flows of saving through financial institu-
tions, commercial banks do not appear to have fared much better than
other financial institutions in the first quarter of 1966, but have
gained considerable ground in recent weeks. After the increase in
the prime rate in March, city banks not only increased their offering
rates on CD's, but also began to compete more aggressively with their
smaller denomination savings certificates and other time deposits. As
a result, the net inflow of time and savings deposits at reserve city
banks in April accelerated to an annual rate in excess of 25 per cent,
with New York and Chicago banks expanding inflows even faster, while
country banks showed only a 6.5 per cent rate of expansion, the same
as in March and down from the 12.7 per cent rate in January and February.
As indicated in the table all of the growth in time and
savings deposits since mid-March reflects time deposits. Consumer-type
time deposits mainly at weekly reporting banks outside New York accounted
for the bulk of the increase. Savings deposits declined quite sharply,
and this decline undoubtedly reflected movements of deposits to take

III -8
advantage of higher rates available on saving certificates and similar
instruments.

*During the same period of 1965 savings deposits rose by $142

There was also an increase in CD's, mainly at New York City
banks. CD's had increased sharply in the latter part of March, but
rose more slowly, net, in April. The sharp increase in March in part
reflected the initial increase in CD offering rates subsequent to the
prime rate increase. Offering rates were maintained in April, and
the premium of CD rates over Treasury bills remained relatively large,
thus enabling banks to roll over large maturing issues.
While the growth of time and savings deposits at weekly
reporting commercial banks was dramatic after mid-March, this should
not be allowed to obscure the fact that savings flows to all of the
major depositary-type institutions--savings and loan associations,
mutual savings banks, and commercial banks--showed a marked year-to-year

III -9
shrinkage during the first quarter this year and probably continued
this trend in April. As the table shows, first quarter net flows
to these depositary-type institutions were the smallest for any first
quarter in the last five years. First quarter inflows to savings and
loan associations were the smallest since 1961, and net inflows to
mutual savings banks also fell well-below levels achieved in each
of the past three years. Relative to the 1965 record, net flows to
commercial banks were also down sharply.

A drop in the total volume of net funds flowing to depositary-
type institutions is not unusual in periods of economic boom and
accompanying monetary restraint. In 1955-56 and again in 1959-60, net
flows to such institutions were similarly restricted as yields on
marketable securities rose relative to rates on time and share accounts.
In those earlier periods, however, the bulk of the adjustment in flows
occurred at commercial banks, which were constrained by the Regulation
Q ceiling and hence could make less effort than the S & L's and mutual
savings banks to match the adjustment in market rates.
In the current expansion, with greater flexibility available
under Regulation Q ceilings, commercial banks have been able to shift
more of this adjustment on to nonbank institutions. And the recent
increase in rates paid on time deposits at commercial banks has exerted
further pressure on such institutions. Complete information is not
yet available for April, but estimates based on results for the
first 20 days suggest that savings and loan associations experienced
a net loss of funds for the month as a whole which may total at least

III -11
$500 million, $400 million more than in April a year ago and by far
the largest April outflow on record. Similarly, for the first
15 days of April, New York City's 15 largest mutual savings banks
experienced net withdrawals amounting to $160 million, more than
four times the outflow for the comparable weeks of 1965.
Thus, the acceleration of time and savings deposit inflows
at commercial banks since late March appears to be in large
part at the expense of other financial intermediaries. It is
also likely that reserve city banks may have captured some funds
from country banks. Finally, all depositary institutions are
gaining funds more slowly as a result of the attractive yields
available to investors in the open market. Such movements of
funds serve to extend the pressure of monetary policy through-
out the financial system.

III -12
Mortgage markets. The shrinkage of first quarter savings
inflows at depositary-type institutions did not lead to as sharp a
contraction in their mortgage lending as some had expected. Pre-
liminary data suggest that commercial banks took advantage of their
improved relative position in the market for savings to maintain their
first quarter participation in mortgage loans at about the same level
as in the first quarters of the three preceding years. Savings and
loan associations were forced to cut-back their net first quarter
acquisitions of mortgages relative to a year ago, but by only $200
million and net acquisitions at mutual savings banks showed a year-
to-year decline of only $300 million. Further reductions in S and L
acquisitions were forestalled by temporary resort to sources of
funds other than new savings. Most important, deposits were drawn
down by $175 million more than in the same period a year ago, and
seasonal repayment of debt to the Home Loan Banks was about $250
million smaller.
The relatively moderate shrinkage in net mortgage lending
at S & L's and mutual savings banks was more than offset by sharply
expanded net mortgage purchases of the Federal National Mortgage
Association, which ballooned to $800 million during the quarter. Con-
sequently, with funds supplied by life insurance companies, individuals,
and others showing little change on balance from a year ago, total
mortgage debt outstanding grew by $6.4 billion, a new first quarter
record, $300 million larger than in the first quarter of each of the
two preceding years.

During the current quarter the rate of growth in mortgage
debt seems likely to slacken--particularly if FNMA purchases fall off
as expected. While outstanding commitments for future mortgage lending
are still at or near record highs, the weight of these commitments is
a factor tending to force greater selectivity on the part of lenders
in accepting new loan applications. In addition, the prospect of
further contraction in savings flows for savings banks and savings
and loan associations is reportedly causing these institutions to
moderate their lending policies further. At the S and L's this change
is being reinforced by efforts of the Home Loan Bank Board to restrict
the volume of advances being used for expansion purposes, as well as
by further increases in Home Loan Bank rates on advances.

III -14
In the first half of April, FNMA mortgage purchases under
its secondary market operations did drop sharply, reflecting further
reductionsduring prior weeks in its price and tightening in other
purchasing requirements. Even at this reduced level of activity,
however, the remaining purchasing authority of the FNMA could be
exhausted before the end of summer in the absence of a change in legal
authorization or a further tightening in purchasing policy.
Given these continuing tendencies toward greater restraint
in mortgage markets, it is hardly surprising that yields on new home
mortgages rose further in March to the highest levels in over five
years. Even so, the rise in yields was less than that on new cor-
porate bonds, so the yield spread favoring home loans was narrowed
again to an unusually small margin.
On conventional mortgages, contract rates for new-home loans
averaged 6.15 per cent in March and those on existing-home loans 6.20
per cent, in both cases 35 basis points above the levels which had
prevailed between early 1963 and late 1965. On certain 5-1/2 per cent
FHA-insured 30-year mortgages traded in the secondary market, yields
reached 6.0 per cent, reflecting a "discount" of more than 4 points.
In an effort to reduce the size of the discount--which must be paid
largely by sellers of homes--ceilings on FHA and VA contract rates were
raised again in April by 1/4 per cent, to 5-3/4 per cent.
As in 1959, rates on home mortgages have now reached levels
where usury ceilings in some state laws are likely to become more of
a restraining factor. Eleven eastern states, for example, have a

III -15
6 per cent limit on permissible contract rates or yields on mortgages
made to individuals and partnerships and (in some cases) to corporations.
One of these states (Kentucky) has recently authorized an increase
to 7 per cent, effective several months hence.
U.S. Government securities market. Since early April, yields
have risen in all maturity sectors of the U.S. Government securities
market. In the bond sector, the recent advance has served to erase
1/3 to 1/2 of the March decline, while Treasury bills in the 3-month
area are currently trading at a level just under their previous highs.

The recent increase in Treasury bond yields has
reflected growing conviction among market participants that a tax
increase is not likely to be recommended by the Administration and that

III -16
monetary policy might tighten further after the Treasury completes
its May refunding. Market activity has tapered off in recent weeks
and has been largely dominated by dealer trading. Dealers have re-
duced their net holdings of bonds due in more than 5-years from around
$115 million in early April to $30 million in early May; concurrently,
their holdings of shorter-term coupon issues have increased, reflecting
in part acquisitions of maturing rights in the May refunding.
The terms of the Treasury's May refunding, announced April 27,
were in line with market expectations and resulted in very little
price adjustments on outstanding issues. However, the new issue failed to
generate any market enthusiasm in the early stages of the refunding.
The Treasury offered a new 18-month 4-7/8 per cent note, priced to
yield 4.98 per cent, in exchange for $9.3 billion of maturing
securities, including a relatively small $2.5 billion held by the public.
The refunding will clear the Treasury financing calendar through
direct debt until July, but sizable offerings to raise new money are
expected in the Federal Agency market over the balance of the current
fiscal year.
Treasury bill rates have risen from their recent lows
established in early April, with the increase most pronounced in the
shortest maturities. Contributing to this rise has been the tight
atmosphere in the money market which has produced higher financing
costs for dealers. Investment demand for bills remained sizable through
mid-April but has diminished most recently.

III -17
In April yields on short-term debt instruments other than
bills remained at their highs established after the prime loan rate
increase, or moved up slightly further, as is shown in the table.

Corporate and municipal bond markets. Yields on municipal
and new corporate bonds have also advanced over the past three weeks,
and now stand approximately midway between the highs registered early
in March and the lows reached in early April. As in the Government
securities market, the yield upturn has been due partly to changed
expectations regarding the relative possibilities of a tax increase
and more restrictive monetary policy. In the face of this changed
psychology, marketing of the sizable April volume of new corporate
and municipal bond offerings has exerted further upward pressures on
yields.

With the upturn of bond yields after early April, investors
in the corporate bond market again adopted a waiting game, playing for
a break in new issue syndicates and a subsequent advance in secondary
market yields. In this tactic they were successful, for over the
past three weeks underwriters have been forced to terminate nearly
three-fourths of the syndicates on major new corporate issues--in some
cases with sizable balances still unsold. As a result, yields on
these issues were adjusted from 8 to 18 basis points higher in secondary
market trading. Likewise, in the market for State and local government
securities, dealers have recently had to raise yields on older issues'
in order to attract continued investor demand. Even so, dealers
advertised inventories grew from a low level of about $360 million in

In April the volume of new municipal issues was swollen
to nearly $1.2 billion by the last minute addition of a $240 million
New York City issue and, to a more limited extent, by the reappearance
of a number of the smaller issues that were postponed in March.
Similarly, April volume in the corporate market, although less than
in March still substantially exceeded the previous year. Looking ahead
to May, however, preliminary estimates show a smaller volume of new
corporate offerings -- less than in April and also less than in May
a year ago. Offerings of municipal issues are likewise estimated at a
somewhat lower level not very different from a year ago. It should be
remembered, however, that bond offerings of all corporations --
financial as well as nonfinancial -- were very much larger in the
second than in the first quarter last year and exerted significant
upward pressure on bond yields even though funds available from
institutional lenders were substantially less committed than they
are now.

III -21
Stock market. During the first few weeks of April, specu-
lation in stocks--on the major exchanges and over the counter--increased
further and became generally recognized as a problem not only by those
within the industry but by outside observers as well. In an attempt
to curb this outburst--especially the participation of small and
uninformed investors seeking quick gains in the low-priced and low-
quality stocks--both the New York American Stock Exchanges imposed new
rules effective April 25. In general, these actions required additional
equity to open a new margin account with a broker and increased the
amount of margin required for day trades. Since the announcement of
these restrictions, the popular price averages have declined and
trading activity has slackened significantly. Much of the contraction,
however, has occurred in stocks which have not shared particularly
in the recent speculative play and thus reflects other factors than
the recent rule changes.
Since April 21, common stock prices--as measured by the
Standard and Poor's composite--have edged downward about 1.7 per cent.
At this recent level, they are still more than 4 per cent above the
mid-March low and have retraced somewhat more than half of their
February-March decline. The ratio of these lower prices to fourth
quarter earnings is a moderate 17.4, down from 17.9 associated with
the February 9 peak in the price index.
The record volume of trading activity and its concentration
in speculative and glamour stocks--often low priced--was the major
evidence of spreading speculative psychology. During the first three
weeks in April, trading on the N.Y. Stock Exchange averaged almost

III -22
10 million shares daily, and the American Exchange reported an even
faster acceleration in activity with a new record of 6 million shares
per day established in the week ending April 15. Moreover, brokers
reported a substantial pick-up in activity in stocks traded over the
counter, with investor interest in new issues contributing to sig-
nificant price advances. By the last week in April, however, the
daily average volume of trading had been reduced on both the Big
Board and Amex to 7.7 million and 4.0 million shares respectively.
Total stock market credit declined $125 million in March
with $100 million attributable to shrinkage in customers' net debit
balances. Taking a somewhat longer view, the volume of total credit
in use in the stock market has risen nearly $1 billion, or about 20
per cent, during the period of rising trading activity since last
summer. Most of the expansion, however, occurred in the last 5 months
of 1965; in fact, margin credit shown in the New York Stock Exchange
margin panel showed virtually no net change during the first quarter
of 1966.
Corporate profits. Corporate profits appear to have shown
another strong rise in the first quarter. Profits of manufacturing
companies, according to data now available for about 600 large firms
that account for three-fifths of the profits of all manufacturing
corporations, were 12 per cent larger than in the first quarter of
last year. For manufacturing industries other than motor vehicles
and iron and steel, the year-to-year increase was 17 per cent, the

III -23
same as for 1965 as a whole. In the motor vehicle group, profits were
little changed from a year ago and in the iron and steel group they were
one-fifth below last year's unusual first quarter.
A year-to-year increase of 12 per cent in manufacturing
profits implies a seasonally adjusted rise of about 7 per cent from
the fourth quarter of 1965. While little information is available
for nonmanufacturing industries, it seems likely that profits con-
tinued to increase here also, though more slowly than in manufacturing.
Thus, it appears that current staff estimates of total corporate profits
in the first quarter, derived from the latest GNP figures, are
reasonable: i.e., a little over $81 billion (seasonally adjusted annual
rate) for profits before taxes and $78.5 billion for profits and
inventory valuation adjustment. These compare with fourth quarter
1965 rates of $77.0 billion and $75.2 billion respectively.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
U.S. balance of payments. Complete figures for March reveal
a deficit on the liquidity basis of $40 million before seasonal ad-
justment, a less favorable result than was suggested by the weekly
indicators. Weekly figures for most of April point to the likelihood
of a relatively sizeable deficit in that month.
The deficit for the first quarter, after seasonal adjustment,
was about $500 million. This figure was swollen by issues of Canadian
bonds in New York postponed from the fourth quarter. Without this
temporary bulge, net of partially offsetting Canadian official trans-
actions, the first quarter figure would have been about $100 million
lower, at an annual rate of roughly $1-1/2 billion.
The total of new foreign security issues in the first quarter
was about $520 million, almost 90 per cent of which was for Canadian
account. Apart from issues postponed into the first quarter, the
adjusted total of about $370 million was about one-fourth greater than
the quarterly average in 1965. New issues were large again in April.
U.S. foreign trade returns for March were favorable: exports
rose by 12 per cent from the depressed January-February level. However,
this spurt included exceptional elements, notably a sharp expansion
of shipments to India following a temporary slow-down in aid shipments.
Both on this account and because of normal irregularities in this
statistical series, it would be premature to regard the March results
as marking a new trend in exports. For the first quarter as a whole
merchandise exports were only one per cent above the fourth quarter 1965
level.

IV -2
Merchandise imports in March were also up strongly -- about
6 per cent from February -- and in the first quarter were 4 per cent
above the fourth quarter. The first-quarter trade surplus was thus
only $4.6 billion as compared with $5.1 billion in the fourth quarter
1965 and $4.8 billion for the full year 1965 (balance-of-payments basis,
seasonally adjusted annual rates).
Exports to the United Kingdom rose sharply in the first
quarter over the fourth quarter level, and exports to Continental
Western Europe, Latin America and the primary producing countries were
up by about 4 per cent. This growth was partly offset by the levelling
off of shipments to Canada and a decline in exports to Japan.
The rise in imports in the first quarter occurred despite a
decline in industrial materials imports. Imports of aircraft, other
capital equipment,and motor vehicles and parts were up sharply, and
there was also an increase in imports of consumer goods other than
autos. Increased deliveries of aircraft accounted for one-third of
the rise in first quarter imports. Reduced imports of steel accounted
for nearly half the decline of industrial materials imports. Steel
imports had advanced sharply in 1965 through the third quarter in
anticipation of a possible steel strike. In the first quarter, they
were down roughly to the fourth quarter 1964 level.
For the first quarter as a whole, the reflow of bank-reported
capital, both long and short-term, came to $260 million (seasonally
adjusted), as a net outflow in March of $120 million (not seasonally
adjusted) offset part of the very heavy reflows earlier in the year.

IV -3
Banks covered by the VFCR reported an outflow of $90 million in March
after experiencing reflows of $380 million in January-February (not
seasonally adjusted). At the end of March, bank claims on foreigners
covered by the VFCR were about $800 million below the target ceiling
applicable to the second quarter.
Recent data show long-term loan commitments to foreigners
in the first quarter have averaged about $60 million a month -- a
slightly higher rate than had been indicated by earlier data, but
still well below the $100 million per month average of the second half
of 1965. Term loan commitments were very low in February, but they
have picked up significantly since then; data for March and prelimi-
nary returns for April indicate that commitments were running above
the first quarter average. However, commitments to finance U.S.
exports declined in March-April, rather than rising with the increase
in the total, and in these two months accounted for less than 10 per
cent of total commitments, compared to about half of the total for
January-February.
Payments balances of other countries. Many shifts in inter-
national payments positions have occurred over the past year. In
Britain heavy drains were being experienced around the end of 1964,
and again in the third quarter of 1965. In the six months from
Septermber 30, 1965 to March 31, 1966, however, the United Kingdom had
a small surplus as measured by changes in reserves (excluding the pro-
ceeds of U.S. securities liquidated, added to reserves in February),
in official liabilities, and in the net foreign position of commercial

IV -4
banks. Shifts in the opposite direction occurred in the balances of
payments of many countries: typically, surpluses became smaller or
deficits larger. But in some important cases the shifts were not great.
The Common Market countries had a combined net surplus
averaging over $2 billion a year in 1964 and 1965, as measured by
changes in net official reserves (including IMF position and bilateral
assistance given) plus net foreign assets of their commercial banks.
In the final quarter of 1964 and first quarter of 1965, they attained
an annual rate of surplus of over $3 billion (roughly adjusted for
seasonality). In the latest two-quarter period (ending March 1966)
the rate was a little under $2 billion. Unadjusted, the combined half-
year surplus was about $700 million, as shown in the table; to this
should be added about $200 million as a rough seasonal adjustment for
the Italian balance of payments.
Almost all of the EEC surplus in this recent period accrued
to France and Italy. Since the middle of 1965 imports have been rising
more rapidly than exports in these two countries, and the change in
their trade balances since then has been contributing to gradual
shrinkage of their over-all payments surpluses. In comparison with the
year-earlier period (ending March 1965) changes in long-term capital
flows have been important. The inflow to France has diminished and the
inflow to Italy, which was unusually large around the end of 1964, has
changed to a moderate outflow.
Germany and the Netherlands have had over-all deficits in the
recent period. For Germany, the deficit has been relatively small and

has shown no clear trend. After reaching its maximum for any six-month
period in recent years during the second and third quarters of 1965, the
German deficit (unadjusted) diminished in the fourth quarter, counter
to its usual seasonal tendency of worsening at that time of year. But
early this year, when ordinarily a sizable surplus would appear, the
German surplus was very small. The Netherlands deficit, unlike the German,
has clearly been growing. Effective May 2, the Netherlands Bank raised
its discount rate from 4-1/2 per cent to 5 per cent, signaling official
intentions of acting more vigorously to damp the domestic inflationary
pressures that have caused worsening of the external balance on goods
and services.
In a number of other European countries, including Spain,
Switzerland, Austria, and Sweden, balance-of-payments surpluses that
characterized the year 1964 have since been shrinking and, in several
cases, turning to deficits. In Switzerland, shifts in capital movements
appear to explain this trend, but in other cases more rapid increases in
imports than in exports have been the primary factor. The Spanish and
Austrian deficits were continuing to grow early this year. In Sweden,
on the contrary, imports reached a peak at mid-1965; with industrial
production level or falling in recent months and unemployment rising,
the balance of payments took a turn for the better early this year.
Outside Europe, the pattern of a shift from payments surplus
to deficit was exemplified from mid-1964 to mid-1965 in Canada, and here
again the largest factor in the shift was the more rapid rise in imports
(in Canada's case especially from the United States) than in exports.

IV -7
However, incomplete data (including commercial bank positions along
with official reserves) indicate that in January and February, 1966,
the balance of payments was again in surplus.
Japan's pause in economic expansion brought a shift in the
other direction, from payments deficit in 1964 to surplus in 1965. In
the latest two-quarter period the surplus (measured, as for other Group-
of-Ten countries in the table, by the official reserves and commercial
bank position combined) was about $140 million, approximately the amount
of the gain in official reserves. Japanese banks reduced their foreign
indebtedness further in this period, but drew down their foreign assets
to do so. The trade balance has remained in surplus, with both imports
and exports rising in recent months. Net long-term capital outflows --
a new development in the Japanese balance of payments last year -- have
tended to increase.
Other important cases of recent shifts from deficit to surplus
have been those of South Africa and Australia. South African imports
reached a peak about mid-1965, and their subsequent decline brought a
rise in the country's reserves after September. In Australia the turn
has been even more recent; there the import peak was reached in September.
Incomplete data for less developed countries indicate substantial
reserve gains for some in 1965. Reserve increases of Middle East petrole-
um producers were concentrated in the first half of last year,when re-
negotiated contracts gave some of them abnormal extra receipts. In late
1965 and early 1966, reserve gains for other primary producers reflected,
among other factors, strengthening of their export markets and actions

IV 8
taken earlier to limit import growth. Throughout 1965, Brazil was a
relatively large gainer of reserves, as the exchange rate adjustments
begun in 1964 and carried further last year bore fruit in export expan-
sion and import curtailment; increased injections of foreign assistance
were also a factor.

APPENDIX A: THIRD ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF GOVERNORS
OF CENTRAL BANKS OF THE AMERICAN CONTINENT*
This year's conference, held at Montego Bay, Jamaica, followed
the informal pattern set at the outset of this series of meetings.
Non-Latin participants included the central banks of Canada, British
Guiana, Jamaica, and the United States. All of the Latin American
countries except Ecuador, Honduras, and Nicaragua were represented.
The fundamental purpose of these gatherings is to provide an
informal forum for the exchange,of views among the central banks of this
hemisphere. The quality of this year's discussions and the breadth of
subjects covered offered impressive evidence of the success of these
talks.
Latin American Governors' Conference
A conference of Latin American central bank governors -- the
second in a series which probably will be held semi-annually -- preceded
the hemispheric conference; however, the non-Latins were invited to and
did attend as observers. In the two days of discussions at the Latin
American meeting, the following major themes were covered:
Clearinghouse and payments systems, primarily for the
countries that are members of LAFTA,2 was the first item on the
agenda. The construction of a network of bilateral agreements among
LAFTA central banks is continuing. These agreements provide for
inter-central bank credits up to the value of 1/4 of the annual trade
balance for a period of 60 days. A number of agreements were signed
during the Jamaica conference and more signings were planned for the
following week in Mexico City. The central bank of Peru, which acts
as the settlement agent, hopes to have the system operating fully by
midyear. Venezuela, though not a member of LAFTA, signed a similar
agreement with Mexico which can provide a precedent for future
expansion of the payments system, apart from formal LAFTA membership,
if necessary.
The role of Latin America in plans for reforming the inter-
national monetary system was discussed in the light of a resolution
by the Inter-American Economic and Social Council referring this subject
to the central bank Governors to examine and to formulate views on the
1/ Similar conferences were held at Antigua, Guatemala in 1964 and
at Punta del Este, Uruguay in 1965.
2/ The Latin American Free Trade Area includes Mexico and most of
the important South American countries except Venezuela.

next steps to be taken. Reports submitted by a group of experts to
CIAP and by CEMLA to the Governors contained some interesting points,
such as the strong Latin American desire to see discussions of this
subject shifted to the IMF, and a desire to link the provision of
liquid assets to the provision of development aid. A much briefer
and more forward-looking document was produced at the conference and
signed as the "Declaration of Jamaica". In essence, it reaffirms
Latin America's desire to participate in the discussions, calls for
greater symmetry between deficit and surplus countries in making
balance of payments adjustments, advocates a central role for the IMF
in liquidity creation, calls for better international coordination
and cooperation, and rejects the idea that the distribution of any
newly created liquid asset be restricted to any particular group of
countries.
Latin American reserve pool discussions were shifted to a
technical committee to be set up by the LAFTA members of the clearing-
house. CEMLA's proposal that any new liquidity created and distrib-
uted to Latin America be devoted to the establishment of a reserve
pool or B.I.S.-type bank received little support.
Increased marketability for IDB bonds held by central
banks was the subject of a plan accepted in principle by the Governors.
Under this proposal, the central banks would make the recent IDB bond
issue placed with Latin American central banks into a more acceptable
reserve asset by reciprocally agreeing to buy bonds from another
central bank when balance of payments pressures threaten the latter's
reserve position. Although it was recognized that this proposal had
some attractive political aspects, such as greater use of Latin America's
own resources for the development of the area and the impetus the plan
give to hopes for greater coordination and cooperation among the Latin
American central banks, it was decided to put the proposal on a strict
banking basis rather than to depend solely on mutual good-will if
accommodation should become necessary. The mechanics of this arrange-
ment will be worked out jointly with the IDB.
Western Hemisphere Conference
Following the conclusion of the Latin American part of the
conference, the continental meeting convened. Governor Rasminsky
described the progress being made within the Group of Ten on the
issue of monetary reform and international liquidity.
Dr. Massad of the Central Bank of Chile followed Governor
Rasminsky's report with a summary report on the Latin American view
of liquidity and monetary reform. Governor Hall of the Bank of
Jamaica expressed the Jamaican interest in monetary reform and
support for the position that the obvious choice of origin for such
reform is the IMF.

A -3
President Hayes commented briefly on the monetary reform and
international liquidity issue, and there followed a general dis-
cussion of the problems of achieving reform and of how Latin
America's views might best be communicated to the Group of Ten.
Chairman Martin reported on the state of the U.S.
economy and on present U.S. monetary policy issues and problems.
Governor Mitchell reported on the U.S. balance of
payments and on the likely impact of current policy on both the
domestic economy and the balance of payments during coming months.
In response to questions from some of the Latin American governors,
Governor Mitchell also described the linkage studies and his hopes
for what might eventually emerge from these studies.
Two reports on the Latin American experience with the
tools of monetary policy were presented by Governors Massad (Chile) and
Schwalb (Peru). These presentations differed sharply from those
of earlier years in that their focus was much more on specific
problems, such as the impact of tax date pressures on the money
markets, rather than on broader issues of central bank philosophy;
the discussions which followed were similarly more in the vein of
sharing experiences in the use of various techniques of monetary
management in Latin American countries.
As the meetings came to an end, there was strong general
recognition that the usefulness of these interchanges had been
amply confirmed and that the discussions and contacts have laid
the basis for increased cooperation among the central banks of
this hemisphere.

Neither the recent marked advance in economic activity nor
the large increase in the number of 18-24 year olds in the population
has been reflected in any significant change in recent trends in
marriage rates. The marriage rate has been rising. But
except for a bulge in the third quarter of 1965 when Selective Service
changed the draft status of married men without children, increases
both last year and so far this year have been moderate. The birth
rate has been continuing its downward course. Not only has the downward
trend in births which began in 1957 continued, but the decline in 1965
was more pronounced than earlier, with the birth rate declining to
levels close to those in the early 1930's. Because of the small increase
in births last year, both the net addition to the population and the
rate of population increase (1.2 per cent) were the smallest in two
decades.
Marriages. Since the very early postwar boom, marriage rates
have been trending downward, although they exhibited some short-term
sensitivity during periods of cyclical expansion and during the Kroean
War. From a peak of 2.3 million in 1946 and a rate of 16.4 per 1,000
population, marriages dropped to a low of 8.4 per 1,000 population
in 1958. This was followed by a period of relative stability from
1958-1962, reflecting a less favorable age composition of the popu-
lation as well as slow economic growth. A moderate uptrend ensued
as the expansion progressed and the wartime babies began to reach
marriageable age.

In 1965 marriages increased somewhat to 1.8 million and the
rate rose further to 9.2 per 1,000 population. During 1965 the marriage
rate fluctuated around that higher rate, as shown by quarterly seasonally
adjusted data in Table II. An apparent downtrend in the marriage rate
which developed after mid-1964 was halted early in 1965. The third
quarter 1965 bulge in the marriage rate undoubtedly reflected the
announcement by Selective Serice that men married after August 26
would have the same draft status as single men. In early 1966 an
expected increase in the marriage rate as a result of higher draft
calls did not materialize; the rate in the first two months of 1966
was about the same as in 1965, suggesting that increased inductions
were tending to reduce, instead of increase, the number of marriages.

Because of the unusually sharp rise in the population of
young persons in 1965 and the rapid expansion in economic activity,
an acceleration in the rate of marriages had been expected by many
authorities. Largely in retrospect, a number of possible reasons have
been suggested for the lack of faster growth in the marriage rate.
First is the sharp increase in the rate of college enrollments last
fall indicating a heightened awareness among young persons of the higher
educational attainment required for an increasing number of jobs in
today's labor market. Second, and associated with increased school
enrollments, is the trend away from the postwar pattern of early
marriage. The median age of women at first marriage has moved up-
ward and in 1965 was 20.6 years compared with 20.2 years during most
of the 50's. A third reason is the concentration of the increase in
population in 1965 among those 18 years of age, well below the

B -3
median age for marriage, especially for men. Finally, an increasing
number of unmarried men in their early twenties have entered the
armed services.
Births. Births declined by nearly 300,000 in 1965 to 3.8
million, the smallest number since 1950. The drop in the birth rate
to 19.6 brought it down to the low level of the depression years
1930-34.

The birth rate has been declining since 1957, but the number
of births continued to total close to 4.3 million until 1962 when the
current downtrend began. By the fourth quarter of last year the rate
and number of births were more than 8 per cent below the level of a
year earlier. In the first two months of 1966, however, the decline
slackened. With marriages rising moderately, the reduction in births
in 1966 would perhaps be less rapid than the year before.
The decline in birth rates has occurred among women in all
child-bearing age groups. In the middle and older age groups a decline was

B -4
expected from the high rates of the 1950's for two reasons. Many
couples who started their families immediately after World War II are
now no longer having children. The low average age at marriage in
the earlier postwar years resulted in a high proportion of couples
completing their families at a relatively young age.
Why birth rates have declined in the younger ages is still
uncertain. Part of the explanation seems to be that young couples
are starting their families later and spacing their children farther
apart than in the 1950's. If this is the explanation, then the current
decline in the birth rate may be only temporary. Another possible
explanation is that young couples want to have fewer children because,
for one thing, they realize that the mounting costs of higher education
for a large family will be difficult to meet. For another, it may
reflect the wife's ability and desire to spend more of her time working
outside the home in order to capitalize on her higher educational
attainment, or to achieve the greater prestige and security her addition
to family income makes possible. A continuation of the current trend
to smaller families would reduce population growth significantly.
Other factors affecting population growth have been fairly
stable in recent years. Net civilian immigration averaged 300,000
a year in the 1950's and 370,000 in the 1960's. Deaths per 1,000
total population have also been relatively constant at an average
rate of 9.4 per 1,000 population over the past 15 years, after declining
from a rate of 10.0 per 1,000 population in the early postwar years.

Population. With the number of births sharply reduced, the
net addition to population of 2.3 million persons in 1965 was the
smallest since 1946 and about one-fourth less than in 1956. The rate
of increase of 1.2 per cent during the year was also the smallest
annual gain since 1945, and well below 1.8 per cent per year in the
mid-1950's. There is no way of telling when the rate of decline will
level off, since marriage rates have been increasing relatively slowly
but even these increases have not been reflected in a rise in the
birth rate.
The substantial slowdown in the rate of population growth
has received relatively little attention mainly because it has been
taking place in a period of sharply expanding economic activity and
very large increases in the labor force stemming from the very high
birth rates in the very early postwar period. It may be argued that
the effect of the slowdown in population growth now is only temporary
and the major impact will not come for another 18 years or so when
those now being born reach labor force age. However, while the
implications are not entirely clear, important changes apparently
have been taking place both with respect to age of marriage and
expected size of families. Some speed-up in marriages should take
place over the next year or two, as an increasing number of youths
graduate from schools and reach the marriage age. Nevertheless,
experts have less assurance than earlier as to the timing of any
reversal in the downward trend in birth rates and the likely level
of future births. Continuing reevaluation of population projections
will be required. In any event, less emphasis on population growth
as a major factor in sustaining economic growth in the next few years
would seem to be necessary.
