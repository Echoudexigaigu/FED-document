SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK
Outlook for GNP
The rate of growth in the over-all economy has slowed this
spring, owing in large part to the sharp drop in auto sales. In the
third quarter, resumption of a faster rate of growth appears likely.
The amount of step-up in the GNP rise after midyear will depend, to an
important degree, on the extent of recovery in auto sales, the course of
defense expenditures, and the scope of the further rise in prices.
Payments under Medicare will begin this summer and the Federal pay raise
may also be effective on July 1 -- both of these will give a special
boost to personal income and consumption expenditures in the third
quarter.
Total consumption expenditures are about keeping pace with
the rise in disposable income, after considerably exceeding a larger
rise in income in the first quarter, and the saving rate appears to be
holding at the low first quarter level (5 per cent). A recent survey of
consumer buying intentions suggests continued strength in demands for
new cars; if not sooner, recovery in auto sales may be stimulated by the
new models, now planned for unusually early introduction.
The rise in defense spending, which in the first quarter was
the largest since the Korean War period, is slowing moderately in the
current quarter, but developments after midyear have not as yet been
clarified. Meanwhile, new orders for defense products were quite
strong through April and the unfilled order backlog has been built-up

I-2
sharply. The uncertainties of the war in Vietnam and the question of
prospective further rate of growth in defense spending remain key factors
in the near-term and longer-run outlook.
Sustained rapid growth in business fixed investment spending
throughout the year has recently been confirmed by new direct surveys
of business plans, as well as by persistently rising orders for equip-
ment and construction contract awards. According to the McGraw-Hill
survey, conducted in mid-May, some companies reported that -- with costs
of installing new capacity rising more rapidly than anticipated earlier --
they are adding a smaller volume of physical capacity for a given amount
of budgeted funds. Thus, manufacturing capacity may not show the
extraordinary 8 per cent rate of increase business anticipated early
this year.
Prices and costs
Given the outlook for GNP, pressures on resources are likely
to remain strong enough to maintain the rise in industrial prices at
close to the pace of recent months. Utilization of manufacturing
capacity in the current quarter is expected to continue at about the 92
per cent rate of the first quarter. Unemployment of experienced workers
and of long-term unemployed is very low. A large inflow of students in
May and June, however, may tend to maintain or increase over-all
unemployment rates in the next few months.
Wages in manufacturing, on the average, still are rising only
a little more than last year and no key contract negotiations in

I -3
manufacturing are immediately ahead. Unit labor costs, however, are
moving up since a little more increase in wages is being accompanied by
somewhat slower growth in productivity. Prices of hides and lumber,
which rose rapidly in the first quarter, have eased somewhat recently,
and steel scrap and some other basic materials also have declined from
February or March highs. But for other industrial materials and for
many finished products, price increases in the current quarter are
apparently continuing at about the first quarter rate.
If, because of increases in supplies, food prices rise less
than seasonally in the current quarter, as expected, the rise in the
over-all measures of prices -- the wholesale and consumer price indexes
and GNP implicit deflator -- will be less marked than in the first
quarter.
Outlook for credit markets
Recent developments on both the demand and supply sides of
credit markets suggest that the up-drift of long-term interest rates and
the tightening of credit terms in evidence since early April is likely
to continue during the weeks immediately ahead. Pressures arising
from restrictions on the supply of funds have been most pronounced
in mortgage markets. Net savings inflows to depositary-type inter-
mediaries have been reduced. Moreover such lenders face potentially
sizable deposit withdrawals after the midyear interest-crediting period,
although the possibility of Congressional and official actions that
might moderate the situation remains to be resolved. Under current
circumstances, mortgage rates and terms have tightened generally along

I-4
with curtailment of new commitments, although total loan disbursements
of mortgage funds by private lenders may actually be fairly well
maintained over the near-term because of the backlog of loan commit-
ments already outstanding.
In addition to mortgages, the supply of consumer credit
appears generally more restricted and is likely to continue so; for
instance, smaller finance companies are finding it more difficult
to obtain funds from banks and all such companies are finding it more
costly to raise funds in the market or through direct placement.
However, the recent reduction in auto sales has tended to moderate
demands placed on the consumer credit market.
Pressures arising from expanded demands for funds have
continued to center in the markets for corporate and Federal Agency
securities. The volume of corporate bond financing is likely to pick
up in June above the more moderate May levels, and total corporate
security financing (through stocks as well as bonds) is likely to be
the largest of the year -- all of which should operate to maintain
upward pressures on bond yields. The heavy continuing volume of Agency
securities, including participation certificates, will place an added
burden on credit markets -- on the short- and intermediate-term sectors
directly.
In the market for State and local government securities, yields
have tended to lag those on new corporate and agency issues since April.
But more recently, yield mark-ups on new issues, together with a moderate
build-up of dealers' advertised inventories in the face of the

I- 5
seasonally large June calendar, suggest that further increases in
municipal yields are likely. Pressure on these yields would be
intensified by any efforts to redistribute savings flows away from
banks towards other depository institutions.
The recent rise in corporate and Agency yields has been
accompanied by a widening of the differential between these yields and
yields on Treasury issues to unusually large margins. This may serve
to exert some upward pressure on Treasury bond yields. The Treasury may
begin raising some of its second half cash needs in early summer, but
probably through tax bills.
Bank loans and deposits
Loan demand at commercial banks is expected to be strong
over the weeks ahead. Business loans may continue to expand at or
possibly above the rapid pace of May. Such loan demand will be buttressed
in June by unusually heavy corporate tax payments, by the expanding need
for funds for investment and other outlays, and by the recent relative
rise in capital market rates.
Expected continuation of rapid loan expansion over the near-
term in the face of restrictive loan policies adopted by banks in recent
months is indicative not only of the force of such loan demand, but also
of banks' willingness to accommodate temporary tax and dividend period
borrowing. The capacity of banks to accommodate prospective loan
demands without generating substantial further upward pressures on
interest rates will depend in part on their ability to roll over their

I -6
maturing CD's and continue to attract "other" time deposit money.
Experience in that respect during recent months has been quite favorable,
but, with respect to CD's, banks have gradually shortened maturities
(to 3 and 4 months in some reported cases) on which they have been
offering the 5-1/2 per cent ceiling rate for CD's.
Even assuming no legislation restricting banks' ability to
compete for time deposits, one might still expect the net inflow of time
and savings deposits at banks to slow down in June from the relatively
rapid April-May pace. The pace of "other" time deposits, however,
could rise again in July following the semiannual interest-crediting
at some savings institutions.

I- 7
Balance of payments
The seasonally adjusted rate of over-all payments deficit
appears to have been roughly as large in April-May as in the first
quarter, on both the liquidity basis and the basis of official reserve
transactions. There would have been a sizable increase in the
liquidity deficit if several hundred million dollars held in this
country by foreign official institutions and by international organiza-
tions had not been shifted, much of it at the suggestion of the U.S.
Government, into long-term time deposits and U.S. Government agency
bonds and notes -- assets that are not classified as liquid in U.S.
statistics.
Most of the increase in the liquidity deficit from an annual
rate of $1-1/2 billion in the fourth quarter of 1965 to about $2-1/2
in January-April of this year (and to more than $3 billion corrected
for the asset shifts mentioned) was accounted for by a decline of more
than $1 billion (annual rate) in the merchandise trade surplus. An
additional factor was the bulge in new Canadian security issues. Re-
flows of bank credit and liquid funds have continued, and direct invest-
ment outflows have probably not increased. No data are yet available
on military expenditures abroad or on Government economic aid -- two
items that are expected to be larger this year than last -- or on
transactions in services.
For the four months through April, the rate of merchandise
imports was 6-1/2 per cent higher than in the fourth quarter while

I- 8
exports were up less than 1 per cent. Imports had thus risen at an
annual rate of more than 20 per cent, or more than twice as fast as GNP.
Exports, on the other hand, rose much more slowly than the imports of
foreign countries, so that the U.S. share in foreign markets diminished.
Both the very rapid expansion of imports and the disappointing
export performance reflect the excessive domestic demand pressures that
have prevailed during this period. Even if such pressures were now to
be brought sufficiently under control so that the trade balance ceased
to deteriorate, the trade surplus for the year would be roughly $1
billion smaller than in 1965. If demand pressures are not checked,
a year-to-year deterioration in the trade balance of $2 billion seems
well within the range of possibility.

THE ECONOMIC PICTURE IN DETAIL
The Nonfinancial Scene
Gross national product. The rise in GNP shaping up for the
current quarter is not so large as in the first quarter, in either
dollar or real terms. In current dollars, GNP is estimated at a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of $726 billion in the current quarter,
up $12 billion from the first quarter. This rise compares with an
increase of nearly $17 billion in the first quarter and a quarterly
average increase in 1965 of $14 billion.
Much of the decline in GNP growth reflects the sharp drop
in new domestic auto sales this spring. In addition, residential
construction activity now appears to be declining; in the first quarter
it had shown a temporary brisk spurt. Moreover, defense expenditures --
still a dynamic expansive force -- are estimated to be rising at a
less rapid rate than in the first quarter. While these three sectors
are contributing to the slowing pace of GNP expansion, a partial off-
set is being provided by the rate of business inventory investment,
which is estimated to be rising moderately following a decline in
the first quarter. Expenditures in other GNP sectors are continuing
to expand at about the first quarter rate, except for net exports
which are continuing the deterioration evident over the period since
last spring.

II -2
In the first quarter, with new domestic car sales rising
substantially to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 9.3 million
and with consumer purchases of other durables also increasing,
personal consumption expenditures on durable goods increased at a
rate of almost $2.5 billion. In the current quarter, sales of new
domestic autos are estimated at a rate of less than 8 million and,
despite a further gain in purchases of home goods, durable consumption
expenditures are down at a rate of about $2.5 billion.
With such a large shift in durable goods and continued
growth in purchases of nondurable goods and services, total consumption
expenditures in the current quarter are showing little more than half
as much rise as in the first quarter. In the first quarter, thanks
in part to the auto buying spree, the rise in consumption considerably
outpaced the rise in income (which was limited to some extent by the
large increase in social security taxes) and the savings rate declined
to 5 per cent, about as low as it has been in recent years. In the
current quarter, the income rise has slowed, in part because of
tapering off of the essentially unsustainable increases in employ-
ment and wages and salaries in the early months of the year.
Consumption is about keeping pace with income, and the savings rate
is holding at 5 per cent.
In view of the probably temporary nature of the safety
factor in the recent decline in auto sales and the strength in new
car demand for the coming 12 months as indicated by the Census mid-April

II -3
survey of consumer buying intentions, auto sales may rise again in
the near future although probably not to the very high first quarter
rates. Consumption generally is expected to show a larger rise in
the third quarter as growth in income accelerates owing in part to
payments under the Medicare program and a Federal pay raise.
The slowing of the rise in defense spending from a $3 billion
rate in the first quarter to an estimated $2 billion in the current
quarter is, according to the official schedule for such spending, a
prelude to a further distinct slowing of expansion over coming months.
However, the current and future course of defense spending must be
as uncertain as the course of developments in Vietnam, and this could
result in wide disparities between actual spending and the earlier
official (Budget) plans. A possible indication of a potential
increase in the defense spending rate is that the build-up in
order backlogs for defense products was very large through April.
The build-up in order backlogs for producers' equipment
and the rise in commercial and industrial construction contracts
awarded have also been very large and this evidence of continued
rapid growth in business fixed investment outlays is now supported
by new surveys of business plans. As of mid-May, business plans for
this year's spending for new plant and equipment were about as strong
as they were in February and March. In the current quarter business
fixed investment is estimated to be rising at about the $2.5 billion
rate of the first quarter.

II -4
Little evidence is yet available on inventory investment
in the current quarter. Inventory accumulation by manufacturers
in April was at a moderately higher rate than in the first quarter,
and retail auto stocks rose considerably when sales broke in April
and May and auto producers made only relatively moderate output
adjustments. Altogether a rise in the rate of total nonfarm busi-
ness inventory accumulation is estimated for the quarter as a
whole -- to a rate not quite so high as in the fourth quarter.

Industrial production. Industrial production rose only
0.3 per cent in April, to 153.4 per cent of the 1957-59 average,
but was 9 per cent above a year earlier. The April rise was small
in part because of strikes that reduced auto and coal output; output
of most other final products and materials increased further. The
index for manufacturing alone increased 0.6 per cent in April and was
9.5 per cent above a year earlier. In may, the total index is likely
to rise somewhat further, possibly by half to a full point, despite
further reductions in auto output.
The rates of increase in output from March to April for
the total index and many of its major components were considerably
slower than from the fourth quarter of 1965 to the first quarter of
1966, but were still appreciable, as shown in the table.

In May, domestic auto assemblies were at an annual rate
of about 8.6 million units, down 7 per cent from April. This decline
and probable declines in output in supplying industries will amount to
a loss of 0.3 to 0.4 points in the total index. This amount is about
equal to the contribution to the index resulting from recovery in
coal production from the strike-reduced April level.
Sales of apparel and consumer durables goods other than
autos have been at the least maintained at the high first quarter
levels, and production of these goods, which increased in April,
probably rose again in May. Output of defense and business equipment
is also estimated to have advanced further in May.
Actual and prospective curtailment in production of autos
and continued expansion in production of most other finished products
are exerting conflicting influences on demands for industrial materials,
for inventory as well as for consumption. The rise in production of
iron and steel slowed in April and May, following an increase of more
than a fifth from the November low. At the May level, production was
close to the records of March and April 1965 when the strike-threat
was stimulating inventory demand. Consumption of steel is quite a
bit higher now, but nevertheless it is likely that inventories held
by steel consuming manufacturers, which declined over one-fourth
from last October to the end of March, are on the rise. Among non-
durable materials, output of crude petroleum, refined petroleum products,
and paperboard continued strong in early May.

II -8
A major uncertainty in the outlook is the course of auto
sales. In the first quarter of this year, sales of new domestic cars
were at an annual rate of 9.3 million units. They declined to 7.9
million in April and then to a rate of about 7.3 million in the first
20 days of May. The disparity between the current rate of sales and
the current production rate of 8.6 million, with exports accounting
for only 0.2 million of the difference, cannot persist. New car
inventories rose further in mid-May and on the 20th totaled 1.7 million
cars, 30 per cent more than a year earlier. Sales of used cars, which
declined 5 per cent from March to April, declined 3 per cent further
in the first 20 days in May and were about the same amount below a
year ago.
Retail sales. Following a sharp run-up in late 1965 and the
early months of this year, retail sales have declined moderately since
March. The advance April figure was down a little more than 1 per cent,
and data for the first three weeks of May suggest a similar decline last
month. These figures are subject to revision.
The bulk of the decline in total retail sales now indicated
for April and May has been at auto dealers. Sales of furniture and
appliance stores have been maintained at advanced levels, and sales of
nondurable goods have continued to expand. The remarkable expansion in
nondurable goods sales -- at a rate of 1 per cent a month since last Fall -- has
reflected in part higher retail prices, particularly for food.

II -9
Consumer credit. Consumer borrowing slackened noticeably
in the first four months of the year. The pace picked up a little
in March as retail sales advanced to new highs, but slowed again in
April and, according to fragmentary data, in early May as well. The
seasonally adjusted annual rate of increase in the January-April
period was $7.2 billion, substantially lower than the $8.0 billion
rate for all of 1965.
The slower rate of growth in borrowing to purchase cars
has been a major factor, but growth rates for all types of credit
have slackened since last winter. Personal loans bulged somewhat in
April as people borrowed for tax purposes, but the rise still was not
as great as a year earlier when underwithholding of taxes was a common
problem.
The slower increase in credit has reflected supply as well as
demand factors. Lenders have been encountering strong competition in
obtaining new funds and have had to pay higher interest rates on the
funds they have obtained. As a result, they have become more restrictive
in their lending policies and have been screening new credit applicants
more carefully than earlier.
The ratio of repayments on instalment debt to disposable
personal income edged up only slightly further in the first quarter. As
a result of the increase in social security taxes, the rate of gain in
disposable income slowed to a little under 2 per cent, compared with a
rise of 2.5 per cent in repayments.

Delinquency rates on consumer loans are a little higher than
a year earlier but below those of late 1960 and 1961. The over-all
delinquency rate, as compiled from data reported by the ABA for a
sample of banks, has averaged about 1.5 per cent, in recent months,
with rates on home appliance loans somewhat higher than that and
rates on direct auto loans well below it.
Consumer buying plans. According to the Census mid-April
survey, consumer intentions to buy autos were as strong as a year
earlier and buying plans for major household equipment exceeded year-
earlier levels. Indications of sustained strength in buying plans were
supported by a large increase in the proportion of households reporting
higher incomes than a year earlier and also by a sizable increase in
the proportion of households expecting higher incomes in the coming
year.
The survey reported 18.7 per cent of the households expressed
intentions to buy a new or used auto within the next 12 months, as

II -11
compared with 18.8 per cent in April 1965. For new cars alone, the
figure was 9.3 per cent, the same as a year earlier. Intentions to
buy new autos within a 6-month period also were about the same as a
year earlier. Recent 12-month new car buying plans are below the
levels recorded in the three quarterly surveys in the period inter-
vening between April 1965 and April 1966, but because of seasonal and
other problems the differences do not appear significant.
Owing mainly to an upping of plans to purchase refrigerators,
television sets, and clothes dryers, the proportion of households
reporting intentions to buy any of the 7 major household durable goods
covered by the survey in the 6 months ahead was 18.8 per cent in mid-
April as compared with 17.4 per cent a year earlier. In the two
preceding surveys, January 1966 and October 1965, year-over-year
increases were also reported for intentions to buy these goods.
Orders for durable goods. New orders for durable goods, which
had shown an unusually large bulge (5 per cent) in March, declined 3
per cent in April. The April level was above any earlier month except
March and was 10 per cent above a year earlier. New orders remained
well above shipments in April, and unfilled orders increased sub-
stantially further.
The April decline in new orders was mainly in fabricated metal
products, aircraft, and miscellaneous durable goods -- all of which had
shown large increases in March. Despite the sizable decrease for air-
craft, total new orders for defense products were down only moderately.
In the first four months of this year, defense orders averaged 36 per cent

II -12
above the corresponding period a year earlier. New orders for machinery
and equipment, which have also been treading upwad, showed a large
further increase in April.
Shipments of durable goods also increased sharply in March and
then declined moderately in April. Backlogs continued to rise in all
major groups, but the bulk of the large April increase was for defense
products and machinery and equipment. At the end of April, the total
durable backlog was up 21 per cent from a year earlier, with defense
products up 27 per cent and the machinery and equipment backlog up 24
per cent. The ratio of unfilled orders to shipments for all durable
goods combined was 3.0 in April as compared with 2.7 a year earlier and
an average of 2.6 in the three-year period 1962-64. In the year 1956,
this ratio averaged 4.2.
Manufacturers' inventories. The book value of manufacturers'
inventories increased $625 million in April, moderately above the rate
of accumulation prevailing in the first quarter and in the last half of
1955. Over that 9-month period, the increase averaged $560 million per
month, with relatively small variations from quarter to quarter. The
ratio of manufacturers' inventories to shipments in April at 1.61 equalled
the average of the preceding 9 months.
Accumulation of durable goods inventories totaled $450 million
in April, as compared with a monthly average of $370 million in the pre-
ceding 9 months. Growth in work-in-process stocks in machinery and defense
industries continued to account for the major part of total durable accumu-
lation. In addition, stocks of durable materials and supplies showed
some rise in April, after several months of little change. In nondurable
goods industries, stocks of materials and finished goods continued to edge
up, while work-in-process inventories continued to show little change.

II -13
Construction activity. Seasonally adjusted new construction
outlays changed little in April from the record $77.5 billion annual
rate in March. Within the private sector, both residential and non-
residential expenditures held about unchanged at $27 billion. The recent
equivalence in outlays for these two major groups is unprecedented in
the post-World War II period and underscores the strength of the recent
surge in private nonresidential construction. Public construction was
down slightly in April from substantially revised (upward) levels.
Private housing starts, which rose appreciably in March,
declined moderately in April. Building permits also declined, mostly
for single family units; such units had accounted for virtually all the
rise in March.
The April decline in starts was less than generally expected.
In view of the large backlog of commitments still to be worked down,
trade expectations are that the major impact on starts of tightening
mortgage market conditions may not show up until the summer months or
even later. If starts decline by 5 per cent or more this year from the
1.5 million units in 1965, the fourth quarter rate might be down to
1.3 million or lower.
Regionally, changes in both starts and permits continued to
be selective, with major declines reported only in the North Central
states where heavy rains and a work-stoppage in and around Chicago
were contributing factors. Basic demand had been particularly strong
in this region, and vacancy rates there have exhibited a definite
downward trend for some time.

Nationally, rental vacancy rates at 7.5 per cent in the first
quarter were little changed from the fourth quarter of last year and
the average of the past four years. At the recent peak in vacancies
in 1961, the annual average had been 7.9 per cent. Among areas, rental
vacancy rates in the West (10.7 per cent) remained especially high
despite the substantial reduction in starts in recent years. Also,
since early 1965, a moderate downtrend in rental vacancy rates within
metropolitan areas has been accompanied by an upward trend in rates
outside such areas.
Fixed capital investment plans and appropriations. Business
fixed capital spending plans for 1966 were substantially the same in
mid-May as two months earlier, according to a recheck survey made by
McGraw-Hill. If these recheck plans are realized, plant and equipment
investment will be up 18.0 per cent for the year following an increase
of 15.7 per cent in 1965. The increase now indicated is slightly less

II -15
than shown in a recheck of another private survey but above the
February Commerce-SEC survey results.

The indicated spending plans were a little lower in manu-
facturing, but a little higher in nonmanufacturing. Within manufacturing,
reductions in plans of producers of iron and steel, nonelectrical
machinery, autos, fabricated metals and instruments and of most non-
durable goods more than offset small increases by producers of trans-
portation equipment other than autos, food and beverages, and textiles.
Newly approved capital appropriations of manufacturers were
nearly 2-1/2 per cent less in the first quarter of this year than in
the final quarter of last year, according to the latest National
Industrial Conference Board survey. All of the decline was at durable
goods manufacturers, where new appropriations were off almost 4-1/2
per cent. But appropriations of all manufacturers still exceeded their
record high capital expenditures, and the backlog of unspent appropriations

II -16
increased to another all-time high. In terms of the stepped-up first
quarter capital expenditures the backlog at the end of the quarter was
about as high as any time in the last two years and thus would support
a high rate of capital spending for the next three or four quarters
even if there were some further decline in new appropriations.
Employment. Strikes in mining and construction in April
substantially reduced payroll employment in these industries and total
nonfarm employment was unchanged at a level 3 million higher than a
year earlier and almost 2 million higher than six months ago.
Employment increased further in manufacturing in April and
continued to advance strongly in Federal and state and local govern-
ments. The private service sector also maintained its strong upward
trend. A 50,000 decline in trade apparently reflected inadequate
adjustment for the Easter holiday and may be reversed in May.
The attention given to the role of durable goods manufacturing
industries in the recent expansion in nonfarm employment has tended to
obscure the large increases in other less volatile sectors. In the six
months since October of last year, nonfarm employment has increased at
an annual rate of 3.8 million, or 6 per cent, with durable goods
manufacturing rising at an annual rate of about 10 per cent. The rate
of advance was also nearly 10 per cent in government, which accounted
for one-fourth of the over-all rise in nonfarm employment. Including
trade and service, the three nonindustrial sectors in the past 6 months
have been adding employees at a rate of 2 million per year. Even if

II -17
expansion in industrial employment were to slow somewhat it seems likely
that government and other nonindustrial employment would continue to expand
at close to recent high rates.

Unemployment. Unemployment compensation data for May
indicate no slackening in demand for workers with previous job experience.
For example, the number of persons filing new claims for unemployment
insurance declined about seasonally in May to a weekly average of 150,000,
and were at the lowest level for this time of the year since the end of
World War II and one-fifth lower than in May of last year. In May as
in April, the average number of persons receiving weekly unemployment

postwar low of 2.4 per cent was in May 1953. Since these data exclude
new entrants and others ineligible to receive benefits, they tend to
understate the current available labor supply. Nevertheless unemploy-
ment insurance data do provide a fairly good measure of the number of
male workers with previous job experience who are involuntarily out of
work. Unemployment among teenagers, who generally are not covered, has
remained high despite strong demands, and now accounts for more than
one-third of all unemployment.
Teenagers. The number of teenagers in the labor force has
increased sharply in the past year. Although their employment has
also risen significantly, the proportion of young workers among the
unemployed has also gone up substantially, partly due to the rapid
decline in unemployment among adult males. As a consequence of the
large numbers of unemployed youths and the sharp fluctuation in their
unemployment rate from month to month, the over-all unemployment rate
has tended recently to fluctuate with the count of teenagers seeking
work.
A further large addition of teenagers can be expected this
spring and summer. The search for summer work or permanent jobs begins
in May and usually reaches a peak in June. While the level of teenage
employment reaches a peak in July, net additions to the civilian labor
force between June and July are usually relatively small because many
of those unable to find summer work drop out of the labor force. Last
year a total of 3.7 million 14 to 19 year olds were added to the civilian
labor force between April and July; in 1964, only 2.9 million entered the

II -19
labor force. Atypically, more than 1 million of the summer rise in
1965 occurred between June and July. This deviation from the usual
pattern reflected in part the early date of the June survey week, which
occurred while some students were still in school and, in part, govern-
ment programs and special efforts of the business community to provide
job opportunities for teenagers, which picked up momentum in July.
This year the survey week in June is a week later and the April-June
labor force additions will probably be much larger than last year.
Assuming the participation rates of teenagers increase by the
same amount between April and July this year as last year, teenage
additions to the civilian labor force will be 200,000 higher than last
year, or 3.9 million. Moreover, labor market conditions likely to
prevail this summer would suggest some greater increase in participation
rates of teenagers. The effect of these developments would more than
offset any reduction due to an increase in the armed forces of draft-
age youths.
The growing importance of youth in the labor force has made
reductions in total unemployment more difficult to achieve than earlier.
Currently, 1 in 3 unemployed is a teenager, compared with less than 1 in
5 a decade ago when over-all unemployment was about the same as it is now.
Largely, the increased representation of youths is a reflection of the
wartime and early postwar bulge in births. Since the unemployment rate
of teenagers, even in good times, is well above the average, their
increased proportion of the labor force tends to "weight up" the

II -20
total unemployment rate. Moreover, their unemployment rate is the least
sensitive to rising demands because of the lack of job experience and
the tendency for their labor force to expand as job opportunities
increase.

Unit labor costs. Unit labor costs for all manufacturing
employees have risen moderately further continuing the upward tendency
of recent months. At the beginning of the year, unit costs were not
much different from a year earlier, despite a rise in social security
payments. By April, however, the differences had widened reflecting
both a little more rapid rise in wages and a somewhat slower rate of

II -22
increase in productivity this year. In April, hourly compensation
of all employees in manufacturing including fringe benefits, was 3.6
per cent higher than a year earlier, about a half per cent more than the
increase in 1965. At the same time, the rise in manufacturing pro-
ductivity in April was 2.8 per cent above a year earlier. This rate
is less than the rise in output per manhour of 3.6 per cent for 1965
as a whole.
Wholesale prices. The industrial commodity price index rose
0.3 per cent from mid-March to mid-April to 103.9 per cent of the 1957-59
average. Through the first four months of the year, the index rose
1.1 per cent, and estimates based on a variety of sources indicate a
continuation of the rise into late May. Average prices of foodstuffs,
which accounted for much of the rise in the total index from early 1965
to early 1966, has continued downward from the February peak; it
declined 0.6 per cent from March to April, and the weekly estimates
indicate a further decline of 1 per cent or more into late May. The
total wholesale price index since February has changed little as a result
of compensating price movements in industrial commodities and foodstuffs.
The industrial commodity price index rose 1.2 per cent from
the fourth quarter 1965 average to mid-April. Reflecting the pressure
of strong demands, average prices of industrial materials increased
1.6 per cent. Major contributors to this rise were hides and leather,
lumber, nonferrous metals, and fabricated metal products. Wholesale
prices of consumer finished products over the same period rose only

II -23
0.6 per cent, with the significant increases in apparel, footwear,
and household furniture. Prices of producer equipment rose 1 per
cent, under the influence of the investment boom.
The rise in lumber and plywood prices which began early this
year apparently has come to an end, and some decline has occurred in
recent weeks, A reduction in defense buying and easing of the boxcar
shortage are partly responsible for the recent declines.
The high world price of copper and of domestic scrap continues
to result in price increases among fabricated copper products. The
Government has begun a program to subsidize copper mine development and
output; however, little or no increase in output this year will result
from this program. Adding further to market tightness, the copper
"setasides" -- the fraction of refining and fabricating capacity immedi-
ately available for priority Government orders -- have now been raised
from 10 per cent to 13 per cent. Increasing efforts to substitute
aluminum in many copper uses appears to be adding further strain on
aluminum fabricating capacity. This new demand added to heavy existing
civilian and military demand has created market expectations of further
price increases for aluminum products such as sheet, cable, and wire.
The price of zinc is softening under the influence of large
increases in world mine capacity and, following the recent decrease
in lead, is expected to decline. Reflecting this market softness,
the price of zinc scrap has fallen in recent weeks after many months of
no change.

II -24
Major steel producers have announced a number of upward and
downward price adjustments which are in line with a new policy of
adjusting specific product prices to their individual demand and cost
conditions. But the BLS has estimated that these changes will raise
the index of steel mill products by only 0.1 per cent to a level less
than 1.5 per cent above a year ago.
Average prices of foodstuffs have declined over 2 per cent
from the February peak which was nearly 12 per cent above a year earlier.
Livestock and meats were primarily responsible for the earlier sharp
rise. Prospects for larger supplies and slower growth of income point
to a continuation of the downward movement of livestock and meat prices
that began in March.
Consumer prices. The consumer price index from mid-March to
mid-April rose 0.4 per cent after increasing 0.4 per cent in March and
0.5 per cent in February. At 112.5 per cent of the 1957-59 average,
the index in April was 2.9 per cent above a year earlier. A part of
the April rise is attributable to restrictive economic policy -- the
rise in mortgage interest rates and the restoration of some excise taxes.
Foods, which accounted for much of the earlier rise in the
index, rose only 0.1 per cent in April as meats declined about 1.5 per
cent mainly as a result of a 5.5 per cent fall in pork. Meat prices
are expected to decline further over the year, and should slow the rate
of increase of the total consumer price index.
Services increased by 0.8 per cent in April with about one-
third of the increase attributable to restoration of the telephone

II -25
service excise tax. Higher interest rates on new HAand VA mortgages
also contributed to the increase, and medical care services rose 0.5
per cent further.
Nonfood commodities rose 0.2 per cent to a level 0.8 per cent
above a year earlier. New car prices increased 0.3 per cent because
of the restoration of the excise tax, and apparel and used cars rose
more than seasonally.

Farm land values. Sharply rising values of farm land boosted
the national index to 150 (1957-59 = 100) on March 1, 1966, 3 per cent
above November and 8 per cent above March 1, 1965. Annual increases in
values in the two preceding years had averaged around 6 per cent.
A major shift in trend occurred in the Corn Belt with annual
increases of 12 to 15 per cent reported in the major corn-hog producing
states this March 1 compared with 4 to 5 per cent in recent years.
Much of the Corn Belt upsweep occurred between November and March as
shown in the table. Values along the East coast and across the South,
which had long been leading areas of strength, lagged behind the national
average this year with the exceptions of values in Georgia and in the
three Mississippi Delta states where increases matched the Corn Belt.
Annual increases in values along the West coast were about the same as
the 7 per cent of the preceding year.
Higher incomes since the second quarter of 1965 have un-
doubtedly been an important stimulus to land markets. Returns from
sales of hogs and other livestock and products have been unusually
good and crop yields and pastures were better in 1965 than in 1964.
Improvement has been most marked in the Corn Belt as shown in the
table. Enactment of a 4-year farm program last October following
several years of temporary legislative programs may also have encouraged
farmers to buy land in the feed grain and livestock areas.
In the South, a variety of influences are affecting land
values. Texas and Florida, following years of unusually rapid increases
in values, had much more moderate increases in the latest year. In

II -27
Texas, the relatively small increase -- 4 per cent -- reflects, at least
in part, the lowering water tables in the Northern Plains and conse-
quent depreciating values of irrigated land. In Florida, the increase
of only 2 per cent reflects declines in citrus grove values resulting
from smaller returns per acre last year. Throughout the Cotton Belt,
lease or sale of cotton allotments authorized by the Act of 1965 is
affecting land values but it is too early to evaluate the effects.
The more favorable expectations of farmers evident in
accelerated advances in land prices in many areas were also evident in
the rise in their borrowings for production since mid-1965. Farmers'
debts to the PCA's at the end of April were 15 per cent above last
April. As shown in the table, sharpest increases were in the Western
Corn Belt where farmers' indebtedness to the PCA's averaged 22 per cent
above a year earlier and smallest in the cotton states of the South.
Retirement of a fourth or more of cotton acreage in return for cash
payments under the new cotton program is undoubtedly a factor in the
smaller loan activity in the Southern states. Farm tractor sales, up
sharply in most areas in the first quarter according to trade association
reports, lagged in the cotton states. This also suggests smaller
increases in investment in current production in the cotton states than
in other areas.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL SITUATION
Bank credit. Total bank credit is estimated to have expanded
at an annual rate of only about 5-1/2 per cent from the end of April to
the end of May, about half the March-April average rate of growth.
While business loan demand was strong, expansion in total loans was
moderate, reflecting in part repayments of heavy March and April tax-
related borrowing by finance companies and securities dealers.
Following substantial acquisitions of investments in April,
when deposit inflows were large and business loan demands less strong,
banks reduced their total security holdings by about $200 million in
May. About $1.2 billion of Treasury issues were liquidated, with a
large part of the decline evidently reflecting maturing obligations
that were not exchanged for the refunding 4-7/8 per cent 18-month note.
The large attrition in the refunding was due in part to the relative
attractiveness of new Federal Agency issues. Bank holdings of securities
other than Treasury issues rose at an annual rate of more than 25 per
cent, following a 20 per cent rate in April. These acquisitions,
which probably included substantial purchases of Federal Agency issues,
were heavily concentrated in the San Francisco District, where total
time and savings deposit inflows recently have been quite large.
Business loan expansion in May accelerated to about the 20
per cent annual rate of the first quarter of this year -- or twice as
much as the April expansion, which had been retarded by two large loan
repayments from the proceeds of capital market issues. Expansion was

III -2
widely distributed by industry, except for construction, where demands
were less than seasonal, and food processors, commodity dealers, and
trade firms, where demands were only seasonal in amount. It thus
appears that over-all business demands for credit remain large. With
the decline in new capital market issues from the high first quarter
pace and with the liquidation of assets to pay March and April tax
liabilities having reduced corporate liquidity, more of these demands
may be in the process of being directed toward banks.
Bank deposits. Following the very large increases in March-
April, private demand balances at banks are estimated to have declined
at about a 15 per cent annual rate in May. In part, this decline
reflected a larger than usual build-up of Government deposits from
late April to mid-May, but it also reflected a delayed reaction to
the very sharp run-up in money balances over the previous two months.
Time and saving deposits at all commercial banks are
estimated to have expanded at about an 11 per cent annual rate in
May, down somewhat from the 16 per cent rate of April but above the
7 per cent rate of the first quarter. The May pattern of deposit in-
flows was similar to that in April. As indicated in the table, savings
deposits continued to decline, although at a sharply reduced rate, and
time deposits other than negotiable CD's continued to expand, also at a
reduced rate. These movements, of course, reflect increased offering
rates on time deposits since mid-March, particularly on smaller

III -3
denomination certificates, and the slow-down from April to May is due
mainly to the end of one-time shifts of funds after time deposit rates
were raised in late March and early April.
New York City bank inflows of total time and savings deposits
in both April and May remained below the 1965 pace, but other weekly
reporting banks have been able to increase their total time and
saving deposit inflows more rapidly than during the comparable period
last year. Both groups lost savings deposits, but city banks outside
of New York -- especially on the West Coast -- had sharp inflows of
time deposits other than negotiable CD's.
Country banks -- whose inflows of time and savings deposits
decelerated in March and April--experienced sharply increased deposits
in May, while reserve city bank inflows in May were less than in April.
This reversal may reflect, in part, the competitive reaction of
country banks, which previously have paid relatively low rates on
time and savings deposits and which might have posted rate increases
only after retardation of deposit inflows forced this action. The
evidence, however, is spotty, and seasonal adjustment problems do not
permit any fine disaggregation of rates of growth by class of bank.

Outstanding negotiable CD's increased by less than $300
million in May, with 55 per cent of the growth occurring outside
New York City. New York banks since mid-May have increased their
offering rates on CD's about 12 basis points on 6-12 month maturities,
and other large weekly reporters have posted similar or moderately
larger increases. By the month-end, most often quoted rates were
generally at 5.50 per cent for 6-month and over CD's, with some reports
of shorter maturities also at 5.50. Very short maturities -- especially
those under 60 days -- generally bore rates of 5 to 5-1/8 per cent,
considerably below secondary market yields on comparable maturities,
suggesting that banks were not greatly interested in selling such CD's.
While competition from other short-term instruments has
tended to put upward pressure under CD rates in the last 2 months or
so, banks may also have found the CD market to be somewhat tighter
than previously for institutional reasons. Bank sales of shorter
CD's has tended to make secondary market trading rather thin, reducing
the liquidity of CD's, and perhaps tending to lead to a reduction of
corporate demand for these instruments at a time when a premium is being
placed on liquidity. In addition, recent Congressional discussion of
proposed legislation to outlaw or impose statutory rate ceilings on
these instruments may also have influenced the demand for them.
Distribution of excess and borrowed reserves. Since the
early weeks of this year, country member banks have sharply increased

III -6
their borrowings from the Federal Reserve to well above the 1959 level.
In addition, the number of country banks using the discount window --
both at any time or continuously within the most recent 12 weeks --
has risen to the highest level of this expansion, although the number of
country banks discounting has not reached the highs of 1959. Reserve
city banks, on the other hand, have increased their borrowings only
modestly over this period. Indeed, from February through May, country
banks have accounted for about 70 per cent of the increase in member
bank borrowing and 93 per cent of the increased net borrowed reserve
position of member banks.
Country bank excess reserves also have declined relatively
more than those of reserve city banks in the last three months, although
the absolute decline has been small. However, thus far during the
1960's excess reserves at country banks have shown a pronounced down-
ward trend and currently are at the lowest level since 1933. With
excess reserves approaching minimal levels and their borrowing rising,
country banks as a group in May were in a net borrowed position for
the first time since 1933.
The factors occasioning the recent sharp increase in
borrowing by country banks (both absolutely and relative to city banks)
and further reduction in excess reserves are not completely clear. There
may be a number of explanations that can only be discerned from a more
disaggregated analysis. But it does appear that country banks are
managing their reserves more closely as interest rates, especially the

III -7
Federal funds rate, rise. The rise in the funds rate to levels as high
as 3/4 of a percentage point above the discount rate may also be an
expression of the extent to which large city banks are willing to
finance their reserve needs without recourse to the discount window.
As they do so in a period when the System is tightening up on net reserve
availability, the burden of reserve adjustment through borrowings will
fall on other banks unable or unwilling to acquire Federal funds at
the premium rate.
U.S. Government securities market. Yields on Treasury notes
and bonds have risen since mid-May, after exhibiting slight decline
earlier in the month. Yields on issues in the 3-5 year maturity area
are currently very close to new highs while yields on long-term bonds
remain below their highs reached in late winter. Treasury bill rates
have fluctuated in a narrow range since early May, in contrast to other
short-term rates which have risen further.

During the past month yields on long-term Treasury bonds
have been alternately affected by bullish and bearish background
developments, including in particular changes in stock prices and the
fluctuating outlook for a tax increase. Most recently, some advance
in yields occurred on the appearance of investment selling which
reportedly included some swapping into relatively attractive corporate
and Federal Agency issues. An additional note of caution was introduced
into the market in late May following the Treasury's suggestion that
Congress might wish to consider raising the 4-1/4 per cent coupon
ceiling in the next fiscal year and allow the Treasury to issue up
to, say, $5 billion longer-term bonds at higher interest rates.
The narrow movement of bill rates in recent weeks has
reflected a neutralization of strong opposing tendencies. Over-all
demand for bills, including that from the System, has been substantial
since late April and most recently dealer bill inventories have been
reduced to quite low levels. Despite this demand and inventory
situation, however, the bill market has retained a cautious undertone
and the tendency for bill rates to move lower has been restrained
by higher dealer financing costs and by rising rates in other sectors
of the short-term debt market. These other short-term rates are
shown in the table which follows:

Federal Agency securities market. Yields on Federal Agency
securities have risen sharply in recent weeks, reflecting continuing
pressure from a large supply of new offerings. Issues reaching the
market in late May were priced at new high yields, including a 5.60 per
cent rate on 9-month FICB debentures. As the accompanying table in-
dicates, the total amount of new cash to be raisedthrough Federal Agency
debt in the second quarter is expected to approximate $4-1/2 billion,
including $1-3/4 billion in pool sales. Staff projections suggest,
however, that the net amount of new cash to be raised in this market
during the third quarter is likely to fall off sharply from the record

III -11
second quarter pace. Nevertheless, in both the third and fourth
quarters the total is still expected to be sizable in relation to
earlier quarters, as the table shows. It should be noted that the
quarterly pattern of pool sales is highly uncertain and could be
adjusted in keeping with market developments. For fiscal 1967 as a
whole, the Budget Document has projected pool sales totaling $4.2
billion compared with $3.1 billion in the current fiscal year.
Legislation enacted in late May would permit an expansion in these
pool sales since the growing total of now eligible securities will
approximate $11 billion at the end of the current fiscal year.

Treasury finance. The Treasury's cash operating balance is
expected to rise to around $10 billion at the end of June, below the
postwar $11.5 billion record set last June but about the same as in
June 1964. A large seasonal cash drain is projected for July and
while the Treasury is likely to have enough cash to meet this drain,
it may begin its program of financing the second half deficit in that
month. An issue of tax anticipation bills would be the most probable
financing instrument. The Treasury's next regularly scheduled
financing will be the August refunding involving a moderate $3.2
billion of publicly-held maturing debt.
Corporate and municipal bond markets. Yields on corporate
and municipal bonds rose further during May, carrying reoffering
quotations on new corporate issues through the earlier postwar highs
reached at the beginning of March. While yields on outstanding State
and local government bonds are still 6 to 12 basis points below their
early March highs, recent advances in reoffering rates on new issues,
along with an expansion of dealers' advertised inventories, suggest
that further near-term increases in municipal yield averages are likely.

Spreads within the structure of long-term rates have widened
further, as yields on new corporate bonds have advanced more than those
on other bonds. Thus, at the end of May margins between yields on new
corporate bonds and those on outstanding Treasury and corporate issues
were about as wide as in the 1959-60 period of peak interst rate
pressure. To a considerable extent enlarged current yield spreads
reflect increased premiums being placed on call protection at a time
when rates are historically high. But beyond this, the current tendency
for corporate bond yields to run ahead of other long rates reflects the
continuing pressure of large corporate demands on available supplies
of long term funds.

III -14
While estimates of bond offerings in the current quarter
suggest that the weight of such corporate borrowing demands may have
moderated somewhat relative to the first quarter (particularly so if
one allows for the fact that corporate borrowing typically peaks in
the second quarter of the year), new capital financing by corporations
in June -- including stock as well as bonds -- is expected to be sub-
stantially larger than in March, the previous peak month of the year.
In May the volume of publicly-offered corporate bonds fell
below that of earlier months and was also smaller than in May a year
ago. While public offerings in June will rise sharply relative to
May, gross corporate bond offerings for the second quarter are likely
to be less than in the first quarter, and unless private placements
continue to show an unprecedented year-to-year growth, they may not
greatly exceed the second quarter of 1965. The impression of reduced
corporate financing pressure suggested by these data is somewhat
misleading, however, for in June a year ago more than half of the
large volume of publicly-offered debt represented issues of financial
corporations. This year's large June bond calendar is wholly
attributable to the accumulated borrowing requirements of nonfinancial
corporations, and with six such companies also scheduled to raise about
$850 million on stock offerings in June, the monthly volume of new
capital financing of all types may amount to $2.5 billion.
In the face of these large continuing corporate demands for
funds, rate pressures have also developed on the supply side of the

III -15
market as funds available for bond acquisition at the types of institu-
tions which lend major support to the corporate bond market have become
less plentiful. During the first quarter, heavy corporate debt
offerings, historically high yield levels, and a view that long-term
yields might turn-down by the end of the year apparently encouraged
pension funds and life insurance companies to make unusually large
forward commitments of funds. At the same time, larger than expected
take-downs of outstanding loan commitments, a drop-off in loan pre-
payments, and, at life insurance companies, accelerated withdrawals
of dividend accumulations and increases in policy loans have reportedly
put further strain on institutional cash flows at some companies. Con-
sequently, funds available for current commitments are quite limited
relative to those of other recent years. In these circumstances an
increasing number of life insurance companies have turned to commercial
banks to draw on credit lines which in the past had typically gone unused.

In the market for State and local government bonds, a large
calendar of prospective offerings, together with rising yields in other
bond markets, has led dealers to raise yields on new and recently
offered issues in an effort to minimize the build-up of their advertised
inventories. Even so, inventories have risen from less than $500
million to more than $575 million over the past few weeks. While the
June volumes of new issues is presently estimated at $1.2 billion, larger
than a year ago, a few small issues have been postponed recently, and
$300 million of the indicated June total represents two large negotiated
offerings whose timing is uncertain and might be affected by the state
of market yields.

Mortgage markets. The full impact of the still tightening
mortgage market on net debt formation and on construction activity may

III -17
be delayed for some time mainly because of the relatively large back-
logs of commitments still outstanding. In April, the year-to-year
pattern of net debt formation reported in the first quarter apparently
still continued; the increase for the Federal National Mortgage
Association more than offset year-to-year declines in net holdings
within the private-lender group for which data are currently available.
Allowing for life insurance companies, which probably exceeded their
net increase in April of last year ($344 million), the total decline
for private holders would be less than implied in the table.

For the future, however, recent Federal Reserve and other
reports indicate that tightening within the mortgage market has

III -18
accelerated over the past two months in the case of both new and existing
properties, particularly residential structures. Not only are mortgage
funds generally more expensive but also new commitments have become
much more difficult to secure than earlier this year. In most Federal
Reserve districts such commitments have ranged a fifth or more below
a year earlier, with some lenders reportedly out of the market altogether
for the time being. Also the increasingly restrictive FNMA purchasing
policy resulted in net additions to FNMA holdings in April below both
the $315 million for March and the monthly average in the first quarter.
In view of the reduced volume of mortgages being offered for purchase
by FNMA, some further reduction in the amount of expansion in the FNMA
portfolio is indicated for May.
For the private-lender group, slowing in net portfolio growth
has reflected mainly reduced net savings inflows to all depository
institutions, particularly savings and loan associations and mutual
savings banks. While repayment flows from regular amortization and
prepayment on existing portfolios have been a strong support, uncertainty
has continued with respect to (1) the pattern of net savings inflows
just before or after July 1 when quarterly and semiannual dividend
periods for savings and loan associations will be completed; (2) the
levels to which contract rates and other terms might go; and (3) pros-
pects of further changes in current FHLBB, FNMA and other agency
regulations that might affect near-term developments.

III -19
Contract rates on conventional first mortgages on homes
increased appreciably in April, according to the Federal Home Loan Bank
Board. This series, which moves more sluggishly than a similar series
reported by FHA, showed a nine-basis point rise in April to a level 20
to 25 basis points above a year earlier. Among the major lender-groups,
the year-to-year increases were most marked for life insurance companies.
at about 40 basis points for loans on existing homes and somewhat more
for loans to purchase new homes. Fees and charges have also risen
appreciably from a year earlier. Less liberality in loan-to-price
ratios and maturities has been reported particularly in the case of
new home loans, but the shift has not been pronounced.

Stock market. Showing considerable sensitivity to day-to-day
news of changing economic and political events, stock prices have
continued to fluctuate rather widely in recent weeks. Nevertheless,

III -20
until Monday of this week when stock prices suffered a sharp decline,
the very recent price trend had been upward. For example, by May 27
Standard and Poor's composite index of 500 stocks had recovered nearly
half of the 9-1/2 per cent price decline experienced from April 21
through May 17. Since then it has lost about 1-1/2 per cent of this
recovery and currently stands at 86.10, roughly 8 per cent below its
all-time high on February 9.
A significant development since the April market break has
been the general contraction of stock trading activity. At mid-April
the average volume of such activity was running about 10.7 million shares
per day, whereas in the most recent week it had dropped to 6.2 million
shares a day. Over the same period trading on the American Stock
Exchange also dropped from 6.1 million to less than 3 million shares
per day. To some extent this general decline in trading activity may
reflect the tighter margin requirements imposed on day-traders by the
two exchanges, effective April 25. But a more significant influence
on trading has probably been the discouragement to speculative activity
created by the late-April to mid-May price correction.
For all of April when speculative incentives were generally
more ebullient and stock prices showed substantial net advances, stock
market credit rose $168 million. Customers' net debit balances with
brokers were wholly responsible for the increase, since purpose loans
at banks declined another $22 million. Taking a somewhat longer view,

III -21
stock market credit rose $285 million over the first four months of 1966,
a slower rate of expansion than in the period of renewed stock market
credit growth that developed in the final five months of 1965. From
August through December of 1965 total stock market credit had expanded
$875 million, more than offsetting the $460 million decline that had
occurred from November 1963 -- when margin requirements were last
raised -- through July 1965.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
U.S. balance of payments. The April deficit on the official
reserve transactions basis was $200 million and the deficit on the
liquidity basis was $275 million (both figures before seasonal ad-
justment). If a zero or small adverse seasonal adjustment is assumed
for April and if the April figures are combined with first quarter data
($260 million deficit on official reserve transactions and $580 million
deficit on liquidity basis, both figures seasonally adjusted), the
annual rate of the official reserve transactions deficit in the first
third of the year has been about $1-1/2 billion and that of the liquidity
deficit about $2-1/2 billion.
Growth of U.S. liquid liabilities in the first four months of
the year was held down by several unusual transactions. Foreign govern-
ments shifted some $130 million into long-term time deposits and Federal
agency securities not guaranteed by the U.S. Government. International
institutions likewise placed upwards of $200 million in long-term time
deposits and such Federal agency bonds. While shifts of funds into
these non-liquid forms by international institutions may represent a
continuation of past practices, a major factor explaining the shift in
foreign official funds has been pointed encouragement from the U.S.
Government. All these transactions have had the effect of improving
the liquidity deficit. None effectively lessens the "exposure" of the
U.S. gold stock.
The seasonally adjusted official settlements deficit in
January-April was nearly as large as a year earlier, and the liquidity

IV -2
deficit was significantly larger. Yet U.S. reserve assets declined
only half as much -- $0.5 billion compared with $1.1 billion in the
first four months of 1965. About half of the decrease was in holdings
of convertible currencies (mainly sterling, reflecting repayment of
the U.K. swap); there were also drawings on the IMF, reducing our gold
tranche position. The gold stock declined only $138 million, compared
with $991 million a year earlier (when France made large purchases).
This year's decline would have been larger if the IMF had not deposited
$147 million of gold to mitigate the impact on the U.S. gold stock of
the current round of IMF quota increases, and if Canada had not sold
$100 million of gold to the United States. The gold stock declined
$86 million further in May.
The foreign trade returns for April are discouraging. Exports,
which had risen sharply in March, dropped back to an annual rate of less
than $28 billion on the balance of payments basis -- some 2-1/2 per cent
below the first-quarter average. Imports, at an annual rate of about
$25 billion,were close to the high March level and much above January-
February. Viewing the first four months of 1966 as a whole, the trade
surplus was about $4 billion (annual rate) as compared with just over
$5 billion for the fourth quarter 1965. Exports were only fractionally
higher than in the fourth quarter, while imports were up by about 6 per
cent.
The increase in imports from the fourth quarter to January-
April was dominated by consumer goods and capital equipment, categories
which had shown particularly marked increases last year. Imports of

IV -3
autos were up by one-third. In part this was the result of imports
from Canada under a duty-free arrangement and may have been partly
offset by the high level of exports of auto parts from the U.S. to
Canada. Imports of non-food consumer goods other than autos are esti-
mated to have increased by as much as 10 per cent between the fourth
quarter of 1965 and January-April 1966. Machinery imports, which had
risen rapidly in 1965, increased 8 per cent further.
On the other hand, industrial materials imports increased by
less than 2 per cent, as a sharp fall in steel imports, concentrated
in January and February, partly offset a 3 per cent rise in other
industrial materials.
The sluggish export performance can be attributed in part to
the decline of agricultural exports from the exceptional level ($6.8
billion at an annual rate) reached in the fourth quarter of 1965 to an
annual rate in January-April of $6.6 billion. However, non-agricultural
exports this year have been only about 1 per cent above the fourth
quarter level. Little information beyond that reported in the last
Green Book is available on the composition or area distribution of
exports.
Other April data relating to the balance of payments are
confined to bank-reported assets abroad and new foreign security
issues. There were further substantial reflows of bank credits in
April. For the first 4 months of 1966 the net reduction in out-
standing short- and long-term claims on foreigners reported by banks
in the United States has been at a seasonally adjusted annual rate

IV -4
of about $1 billion. (Bank claims under the VFCR, for which the
seasonal adjustment could be expected to be similar, also declined at
a $1 billion annual rate).
Three-fourths of the reflows this year have been in short-
term assets, with sizable declines in outstanding bank loans and
acceptance credits and also in bank-reported holdings of deposits
and money market paper. (Through March, non-banks reported net outflows
of liquid funds of about $100 million, approximately offsetting the
reflows reported by banks.) Outstanding long-term bank claims were
cut in the first quarter, in part as a result of sell-offs of loans
from head office portfolios to foreign branches, but long-term loans
rose in April.
Recent data on new long-term loan commitments to foreigners
do not appear to foreshadow any significant reflow on term loans. New
commitments in March and April were close to a rate of $100 million a
month, after having fallen to about half this rate in January-February.
The March-April rate of new commitments, if matched by disbursements,
would probably offset the current reflow of amortizations and repayments,
and thus maintain the volume of outstanding term loans to foreigners
near present levels. (A similar rate of new commitments in the last
10 months of 1965 was accompanied by little change in long-term loans,
apart from reductions attributable to sell-offs.) In the absence of
further reflows of long-term loans, the $1 billion annual rate of reflow
of total bank credit is unlikely to be sustained -- barring any such
major structural shift in the financing of trade as would be involved

IV -5
in the Japanese authorities' allowing extensive replacement of
external by domestic credit in the financing of Japanese importers.
On the other hand, the net outflow on new foreign security
issues in the first 4 months has been exceptionally high, under the
pressure of very heavy Canadian offerings. The total outflow for the
4 months has been at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of about $1-3/4
billion, including Canadian issues postponed from late 1965. While
Canadian issues this year will doubtless set a record, some easing in
the total outflow of foreign issues from the January-April rate should
be expected in the rest of 1966 (and in fact foreign security issues
fell sharply in May). Such a reduction in outflows on new issues may
go a considerable way toward offsetting the effects on the payments
balance of reduced reflows of bank credits.

IV -6
Financial markets abroad. In the past three or four months
interest rates have risen in many countries. Especially sharp in-
creases have occurred in Germany, the Netherlands, and Canada. (For
earlier developments see the Green Book of February 24.) France, Italy,
and Japan continue to have relatively easy credit market conditions.
In Britain, bond yields have risen further and are now at
about the peak level of August 1965, or about 1/2 percentage point
higher than last October. By May 26, War Loan yielded 6.80 per cent.
Pushing up bond yields, new corporate security issues since
last October have been running about three times as large in total as
a year earlier. One factor behind this is that the squeeze on bank
credit has become very tight. Since early February the ceiling on season-
ally adjusted bank credit to the private sector has been fixed, for an
indefinite time ahead, at 105 per cent of the March 1965 level. In
April 1966 bank loans were only 1/2 of 1 per cent below this ceiling.
A factor stimulating bond issues in preference to equities is the
deductability of interest payments for the new corporate income tax;
previously, interest and dividends were on an equal footing in the
British tax structure.
Another factor behind the decline in bond prices and rise in
yields may have been the mounting evidence that inflationary pressures
were not being held in check by the stabilization effort. Prices and
wages have continued to advance steadily. In May unemployment re-
mained at a very low level and job vacancies were the highest for that
month in 15 years. Imports in March-April averaged 3 per cent above
the 1965 fourth-quarter level.

IV -7
Mortgage lending by the building societies has expanded
strongly since last autumn. The increase last June in the deposit
rates paid by building societies, just as competitors for funds were
lowering their rates because of the Bank rate decrease at that time,
has produced a large inflow of funds to the societies. The higher
deposit rate cut into profit margins, with the consequence that a pro-
posal to raise the lending rate from 6-3/4 to 7-1/8 per cent is now
under consideration.
There has been no significant change in the levels either of
Treasury bill yields or of local authority deposit rates since the Bank
rate cut of June 3, 1965 from 7 per cent to 6 per cent. The local authori-
ties have been able to turn to the Public Works Loan Board for medium-
and long-term funds whenever the short-term markets have become too tight.
As happened in the last fiscal year, it is possible that such borrowings
from the central government will exceed the budget estimate -- about
$1.2 billion for the current fiscal year, ending March 31, 1967.
It is unlikely that market rates of interest in Britain,
short-term or long-term, will ease significantly unless and until the
signs of overheating in the British economy begin to diminish and the
foreign trade account shows substantial improvement.
In Germany, after a period of seasonal easing at the beginning
of the year, market rates of interest resumed their rise, and at an even
faster pace than during 1965. The 90-day interbank loan rate, for ex-
ample, which stood at 3-3/4 per cent in May 1964 and at 4-3/4 per cent
in May 1965, averaged 6-1/8 per cent in the first three weeks of May 1966.

IV -8
In the bond market, the brief rally that started on
December 31 gave way within a few weeks to almost omplete demoraliza-
tion. Yields on 6 per cent Government bonds rose from 7.59 per cent
in January to 8.05 per cent in mid-May. Even at these yields, funds
are not forthcoming in sufficient volume, and new public authority
issues are being kept off the market during the months of May and June.
Local authorities have turned to the banks for medium- and short-term
loans. Outside the officially recognized bond market, borrowers -- both
public and private -- have been selling notes that are subject neither
to licensing nor to reporting requirements, at rates of about 9 per cent.
These conditions reflect, on the one hand, the severely tighten-
ed liquidity position that has been imposed on the banks by the Bundesbank's
restrictive monetary policy (implemented in part by reserve requirement
increases and rediscount quota decreases), and on the other hand the
persistently heavy demand for credit. Demands for funds by governmental
units at various levels still reflect deficitary imbalances that are due
in part to the income tax cut at the beginning of 1965. Public expendi-
ture trends are strongly upward, and cash balances are no longer large.
Strong demand for funds by business borrowers -- despite indications
that business capital expenditures are no longer rising rapidly -- has
been attributed in part to willingness to assume heavier debt burdens
because of the general conviction that now exists in Germany (as well
as in some other European countries) that the rise in prices and incomes
will continue to cancel off the costs of high interest rates.
Given the Bundesbank's determination to maintain a restrictive
monetary policy until cost and price inflation is checked, the May 27

IV -9
increase in the central bank discount rate from 4 to 5 per cent was
virtually mandatory in view of the increases that had already occurred
in market rates. Rediscounts had been growing rapidly; many banks
had approached and some had reached their rediscount quotas and were
willing to pay an additional 1 per cent for "Lombard credits," which
are not limited by the quotas. Such advances by the Bundesbank last
month were at the unprecedented level of DM 900 million, while rediscounts
amounted to DM 7.5 billion. The Lombard rate was raised on May 27 by
1-1/4 per cent.
Before the rise in the Bundesbank rates, bank lending rates
had been rising toward the legal maxima, then 7 per cent for discount-
able paper and 8-1/2 per cent for most other credits. These two ceil-
ings move up automatically by 1 per cent with the discount rate.
Following the discount rate increase, the Federal Banking Super-
visory Office raised the rate ceilings for various types of time and
savings deposits, effective July 1. The basic savings rate was moved
up from 3-3/4 to 4-1/2 per cent. Savings deposits with a notice of 12
months to 2-1/2 years will now receive 5-1/2 rather than 5 per cent.
Rates on time deposits for 3 months or longer in amounts exceeding
DM 100,000 ($25,000) were freed from restrictions.
In the Netherlands, the central bank discount rate increase
of May 2 from 4-1/2 to 5 per cent was the first increase since early
1964, and followed strong advances in market rates during 1965 and the
first four months of 1966. Rediscounting at the central bank had become
increasingly profitable. This development, together with the emergence
and persistence since the latter part of 1965 of substantial deterioration

IV 10
in the Dutch external current account, explains the reversal of the
Netherlands Bank's earlier policy of avoiding a discount rate increase.
After three years of inflationary pressures, profit margins
have been declining and capital expenditures by Dutch industry have
tended to level off. The hesitance about raising the discount rate
stemmed partly from a wish not to discourage industrial investments, in
view of the continuing labor shortage and the need for productivity
gains to enable Dutch industry to compete effectively in world markets.
In Canada, the central bank discount rate was raised on
March 14 from 4-3/4 to 5-1/4 per cent, making a total rise of 1 per
cent since early December of last year. The Canadian 3-month Treasury
bill rate has been close to 5 per cent in the past two and a half months,
as compared with 4 per cent last autumn and with levels fluctuating
around 3-3/4 per cent during much of 1964 and the first quarter of 1965.
The rise in Canadian interest rates, short- and long-term,
that began in the spring of 1965 has reflected a booming economy and
a mildly restrictive monetary and credit policy of the Bank of Canada.
The spread between Canadian and U.S. long-term rates did not alter much
between mid-1965 and February 1966. Since the end of February, however,
the dip in U.S. bond yields and further advance in Canadian has widened
the spread considerably.
In April there was further expansion of seasonally adjusted
bank loans, accompanied, however, by a running down of bank holdings
of Government securities. The ratio of "more liquid assets" to total
assets fell from 31.0 per cent in January to a record low of 27.9 per

IV -11
cent on May 4. The conventional minimum for this ratio is 30 per cent.
By May 18, it was brought up again to about 29 per cent. (This ratio
covers cash, money market loans, Dominion Government securities of all
maturities, and net foreign assets.)
In several Continental European countries besides Germany and
the Netherlands financial markets have tightened over the past twelve
months. In Belgium this is a very recent development. The central bank
discount rate was raised this week (effective June 2) from 4-3/4 to 5-1/4
per cent. Credit expansion ceilings were reimposed in late April, after
having been suspended in mid-1965. In early May, the Cabinet approved
an anti-inflationary program that includes a 3-months price freeze.
Tariffs and indirect taxes on certain commodities are being lowered in
return for commitments from business concerns to reduce prices.
The Belgian internal economic situation resembles the British,
in that little expansion of output has occurred over the past year,
while prices have been advancing. In March consumer prices were 5.5
per cent higher than in March 1965; wholesale prices were up somewhat
less than 3 per cent, but since last autumn their rise had accelerated.
In Switzerland, the tightening of financial markets since
early 1965 has been largely a reaction to tighter conditions and higher
interest rates in other countries. The 3-month deposit rate by March
was back up to its December level of 4.00 per cent. Recently there
have been reports of funds being bid for at rates up to 4.25 per cent,
in contravention of the agreement among the major Swiss banks. The
moderately restrictive ceiling on bank credit expansion has not been
altered.

IV- 12
Since mid-1965 Swiss long-term interest rates have been at
or close to an all-time high, around 4 per cent for Government bonds.
This spring, to facilitate the financing of low and medium-priced
housing, the authorities modified the restrictions on foreign capital
in Switzerland, effective April 1, to allow foreign purchases of mortgages
and mortgage bonds.
In Sweden, long-term bond yields have risen beginning last
December. Despite the leveling off in industrial production since
mid-1965, prices have continued to rise; the cost of living in February
was 8 per cent higher than a year earlier. Business investment expendi-
ture plans are reportedly strong.
In France, Italy, and Japan, the relative ease of credit con-
ditions contrasts with the situation in most other industrial countries.
The situation in these countries is a reflection of the larger margins
of resources they now have to permit economic expansion, in turn the
result of earlier anti-inflationary measures.
Resumption of expansion in France since the spring of 1965
has begun to put some upward pressure on interest rates. Drains on
bank liquidity, from currency expansion and from public sector trans-
actions with the central bank, were only partly offset by reserve funds
supplied through growth of net official gold and foreign exchange
reserves; consequently, rediscounts at the central bank have increased
considerably. However, the Bank of France has used variations in the
asset ratio, along with its own operations in the money market, to
prevent the call money rate from exceeding 4-7/8 per cent at most times.

IV -13
In Italy, the monetary authorities have aimed to keep
credit conditions easy in order to facilitate the resumption of
economic expansion. Long-term bond yields have come down substantially,
in spite of the recovery of domestic production and some increase in
the annual total of new security flotations between 1964 and 1965. The
balance-of-payments surplus, which contributes to monetary ease, has
continued large (for the time of year). In the 6 months November 1965
through April 1966, the banks' net foreign asset position increased by
$106 million, while the Bank of Italy's reserve increase of $377 million
was a factor supplying lira reserve funds to the banking system.
In Japan, seasonally adjusted bank credit has continued to
expand at a fairly steady annual rate of 13 or 14 per cent. The average
interest rate on bank loans and discounts fell further in March to 7.54
per cent. This contrasts with the peak of 7.99 per cent reached in
the latter half of 1964. Call loan rates through May 21 remained un-
changed from the low levels first reached on October 1 of last year.
There are signs, however, of a possible mild tightening in
monetary conditions. According to the Japanese financial press, the
Bank of Japan began in May to shift its easy money policy to a "neutral"
policy. Bank of Japan bond sales were increased from the originally
scheduled ¥50 billion for May to ¥70 billion. In addition, the
monetary authorities will reportedly arrange for an increase in the
call loan rate by 0.183 per cent in June. These steps toward mild
tightening may have been prompted in part by a rather substantial rise
in wholesale prices. In the three-month period ending in February

IV -14
wholesale prices rose 2.1 per cent. After dipping slightly in March,
wholesale prices rose again in April to a level 3.4 per cent higher
than a year earlier.
Interest rates and commissions on U.S. dollar import accept-
ance bills now generally exceed the cost of yen financing of imports.
In order to avoid too rapid a switch to domestic sources of trade financ-
ing, the Japanese authorities have taken steps in recent months to
liberalize restraints on the foreign operations of the banks. The
foreign exchange reserve requirement (against certain types of short-
term foreign liabilities) has been reduced from 25 to 15 per cent. The
maximum limit on long positions in foreign exchange has been reduced by
about 10 per cent. In addition, moral suasion is used to discourage
too rapid a repayment of U.S. credits.

APPENDIX A:
THE EEC: THE END OF THE DEADLOCK OVER AGRICULTURE*
On May 11, the EEC Council of Ministers reached an agreement
which represented a major step towards completion of the European Common
Market. On July 1, 1968, all import duties among the EEC countries
will have been eliminated, the common external tariff will be established,
and the common agricultural policy (CAP) will be fully effective.1/
Community activities had been paralyzed for almost one year
as a result of a breakdown in the talks on the arrangements for financing
the CAP. However, the conflict went much deeper than the mechanics of
financing arrangements. The clauses of the Treaty of Rome providing
for a common agricultural policy implied that the function of regulating
the agricultural sector was to be ceded by the national governments to
the EEC institutions. A basic conflict between France and the other
members of the Community arose over this matter, which raised the general
question of the degree of supra-nationality to be given to the EEC
Commission. But even without these political aspects, the CAP was one
of the most difficult parts of the Common Market arrangements to reach
agreement on. because of the great variety in degree and methods of
agricultural protection in the member countries.
The aim of the CAP briefly is to:
a) increase agricultural productivity within
the EEC;
b) ensure a fair income to EEC farmers;
c) stabilize markets within the EEC; and
d) ensure reasonable prices to EEC consumers.
To achieve these aims, special market regulations are applied
to a range of basic commodities which currently account for about 85 per
cent of the EEC's agricultural production. With the removal of internal
trade barriers, agricultural prices will ultimately be unified. Common
prices are being set at compromise levels affording a measure of con-
tinuing protection to high-cost producers, such as the German farmer,
while preventing the appearance of huge surpluses in the lower-cost
areas, France in particular. The major instrument of protection

1/ On July 1, 1968, the formation of the customs union of the EEC
countries will have been completed a year and a half earlier than was
contemplated in the 1958 Treaty of Rome. However, the transition
period towards the full completion of the Common Market is still to run
until December 31, 1969. By that time harmonization of national tax
policies, common anti-dumping arrangements, control of intra-Community
restrictive practices, etc., are to be achieved.

against imports from outside is a system of variable import levies--
tariffs which can be changed daily if necessary.l Exports to the
outside are to be subsidized as necessary. The key levy and support
price system is that for grains; similar levy systems apply to pork,
beef and veal, eggs and poultry, dairy products, rice, olive oil, and
fruits and vegetables. Intra-EEC trade is regulated by temporary levies
designed to neutralize the effects of differences in national price
levels. These levies are set so as to give intra-Community suppliers
a margin of preference over outside suppliers and will have disappeared
completely by July 1, 1968.
Grain price controversy
The recent conflict began with the attempts to secure agree-
ment on the unification of grain prices. Germany, with an inefficient
but politically articulate agricultural sector, was reluctant to cut
its high support level for grain prices; France, on the other hand,
feared that agreeing to higher support prices would bring increased
production and create a serious surplus commodity disposal problem.
In December 1964 agreement was reached on a uniform grain
price to go into effect July 1, 1967, set about half-way between the
then current French and German price levels. At that time it was
also agreed that intra-Community tariffs on pork and poultry will be
removed at the same time as grain-price unification is to take effect,
because national differences in these prices largely reflect differences
in feed prices. As part of this agreement, France was promised rapid
completion of permanent arrangements for Community financing of the
Common Agricultural Policy.
Basic conflict
Under the original interim financial arrangements, the
European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (known by its French
initials as FEOGA) was established to receive funds from the member
countries and to disburse them for eligible expenditures.- Member
countries' contributions were based in part on the value of net imports
from outside the Community and in part on a burden-sharing formula.
In the proposals for permanent arrangements, the proportion of national
price support payments and export subsidies borne by the FEOGA was to

Section" which reimburses the cost of price supports and export sub-
sidies and b) the "Guidance Section" which finances capital improve-
ments.

be expanded gradually until 1970, when it would pay 100 per cent of
these expenses. France was particularly anxious to have such an
arrangement established because her outlays for these purposes are
likely to be very large.
However, the EEC Commission linked to this course of action
some proposals which would make the Community organizations financially
independent of the Governments of the member states. Rather than
secure part of FEOGA's resources from contributions from member govern-
ments through the EEC Council of Ministers, the Commission proposed
that all customs receipts, on industrial as well as agricultural
products, be turned over to the Community. In addition, responsibility
for the EEC budget was to be shifted from the Council of Ministers to
the European Parliament (which might ultimately be responsible directly
to a European electorate).
It was these proposals to which France objected strongly
because she regards the Common Market strictly as an organization of
member states and not as a potential "superstate". Because France
found herself isolated on this issue, the French Government boycotted
the Council of Ministers meetings from July 1965 through mid-January
1966. Thus, the conflict over financing the CAP reflected not just the
inherent difficulty in substituting a Community-wide program for the
existing national schemes for protecting agricultural incomes, but it
also brought to the surface a fundamental difference of opinion between
France and her EEC partners as to the nature of the Common Market
itself.
The agreement
The agreement reached on May llth provides for financial
arrangements for agriculture until the end of the transition period,
that is until December 31, 1969, only. Thus, the Community is still
governed by interim arrangements on agricultural financing. However,
it is expected that permanent arrangements for the period from 1970
onward will be less difficult to establish than were the present
interim agreements.
The current agreement gives France satisfaction on all the
vital issues. On agricultural financing, the Six agreed that, commencing
July 1, 1967, FEOGA will reimburse member governments for all national
outlays on export subsidies and price supports for those products
governed by market regulations. For the period mid-1965 to mid-1967,
FEOGA will reimburse member governments for a rising portion of their
expenses. Between July 1967 and December 1969, each country will pay
into FEOGA 90 per cent of the receipts from levies on agricultural

A- 4
products imported from non-member countries. This, however, is estimated
to bring in little more than half the required amount; the balance will
be raised according to a burden-sharing scale../
The new financial arrangements do not provide for turning
over to the EEC receipts from the common external tariff, as had been
proposed in March 1965. Also, the role of the European Parliament in
the budgetary process will not be expanded. Thus, France has managed
to postpone any progress towards political integration in the Common
Market.
Germany, in return for agreeing to the agricultural financing
proposals, secured a commitment for the completion of the common market
for industrial products. The remaining intra-EEC duties on industrial
products will be reduced by one-quarter (5 per cent of the end-1957
rates) on July 1, 1967, and the remainder will be abolished on July 1,
1968. The common external tariff will also come into effect at that
time.
Germany, supported by the Netherlands, announced that the
agreement on agricultural financing is a conditional one, subject to
decisions being made on the following:
1) Market regulations for sugar, fruits and vegetables,
fats and oils;
2) Common prices for milk, fats and oils, rice, sugar,
beef and veal;
3) Negotiating mandates to the EEC Commission for the
Kennedy Round; and
4) Restriction of credits on financing the sale of
agricultural surpluses to Eastern Europe.
France acknowledged these conditions, and official observers
stated that the atmosphere at the May 11 meeting was good despite the
hard bargaining that took place. As one Belgian official put it, the
agreement was not so much "...a conditional agreement, but rather an
unconditional agreement in principle."
1/ Belgium: 8.1%, Germany:31.2%, France: 32.0%, Italy: 20.3%,
Luxembourg: 0.2%, and the Netherlands: 8.2%. France has, for the
first time under such arrangements, agreed to pay more than Germany.

Wider implications of agreement
The nearing of the completion of the construction of the
common market for both industrial and agricultural products has far-
reaching implications for the economies of the Six as well as for
third countries.
On the industrial side, the adjustment of national tariffs
to the CXT and the full removal of internal tariffs will give inside
producers their final preferential margin over outside suppliers.
This last step will be of particular significance for outside suppliers
to the Benelux countries and Germany, because these countries will
have to raise their national tariffs in the last move towards the
uniform outer tariff. Concern about the consequences of increased
prices of imported goods on their internal economies prompted these
countries, and particularly Germany, to press for a Commission man-
date to move forward in the Kennedy Round as a condition for agreement
on the CAP. Although few people have any illusion that tariff
negotiations on the agricultural sector will have meaningful results,
there is some hope now that something may be achieved on the industrial
side.
Any success in negotiating down tariffs in the Kennedy
Round will help to reduce the trade diversion effects of the formation
of the Common Market. Various estimates put these effects at around
$1 billion for industrial and at about $700 million for agricultural
goods. The United States would be particularly strongly affected:
about $500 million worth of United States agricultural exports to the
EEC are affected by the CAP and it is estimated that the full effect
of the CAP may reduce United States exports to the EEC by about $250
million below what they might have been otherwise.1!
Implications for the six individual countries within the EEC,
beyond those of trade relationships with third countries, are equally
important and widely divergent. By the time the CAP is in full operation,
it is estimated that its levy system on imports and budgetary contri-
butions from the individual countries will yield about $1.6 billion
annually to be used for agricultural price supports, export subsidies
and capital improvement expenditures. The largest net beneficiary of
the CAP is France, who is estimated to receive in the first full year
of operation about $250 million more from FEOGA than she pays in. In
addition, she will derive about $100-$150 million more from net sales
at above world market prices to partner countries. Most of the cost
for these net benefits accruing to France will be borne by Germany,
while the other three countries will find themselves in rough equilibrium.
1/ These estimates were based partly on an unpublished manuscript
by L. Krause of the Brookings Institution and partly on a U.S. Department
of Agriculture internal study.

A- 6
No estimates, however, have been made for economic costs in
terms of re-allocation and possible misallocation of resources either
between industry and agriculture or purely within the agricultural
sector because of administered market prices for agricultural products.
The economic cost to countries (primarily the Benelux countries) which
now give little protection to their agricultural sectors may be parti-
cularly high.
Policies designed to achieve balanced economic growth and to
contain inflationary pressures will be affected by the CAP. Since 1962,
when the first moves towards a common agricultural policy became
effective, some countries have had to raise their internal prices for
certain agricultural goods. The moves toward full completion of the
CAP will entail further price increases in that sector, particularly
for the Benelux countries; for Germany, in turn, it may bring about a
lowering of food prices. To the degree that agricultural prices affect
wage and price policies in the entire economy, changes in competitive
relationships, both within and outside the EEC, will occur.
The eight-year period (from 1962 to 1970) chosen for the full
implementation of the CAP was to help make the adjustment gradual. This
gradual adjustment process is particularly important because the latest
moves towards integration mean that it now becomes very difficult to
use exchange rate changes as a possible adjustment instrument within
the Common Market. Alignment of agricultural prices among countries,
with the unified price expressed in a common value unit, means that
any unilateral change in exchange rates would automatically give rise
to an opposite change in the prices of agricultural goods. To the extent
that such price changes work through to the general price level, exchange
rate adjustments would be offset.
