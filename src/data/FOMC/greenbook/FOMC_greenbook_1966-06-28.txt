SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK
Outlook for GNP
Following the marked slowdown in the current quarter, a pick-
up in the rate of growth in GNP is in prospect after midyear, but
expansion over the last half of the year is not likely to be as rapid
as in late 1965 and early 1966.
Given the large backlogs of defense orders, and with a military
pay raise likely to become effective soon the increase in defense spending
in the second half of the year could be about as large as in the first
half, even without much further escalation of the war. Moreover, recent
evidence on business plans, order backlogs, and the rate of capacity
utilization supports the prospect of continued rapid increases in business
fixed investment. In fact, expansion in capital expenditures may be
unusually large in the third quarter, making up for a lag in the current
quarter when strikes slowed the rise in business construction. On the
other hand, considerable weakness is now apparent in residential
construction, and further declines are in prospect.
Part of the explanation for the less expansive tone of consump-
tion expenditures in the current quarter was the unexpectedly large
rise in the Federal individual income tax take, which, together with a
distinct slowing of the rise in personal income, has resulted in a
small increase in disposable income. In the third quarter, consumer
income is expected to rise considerably faster, in part because of

I-2
Medicare payments and the Federal pay increases, but consumption over-
all may lag the rise in income somewhat.
In the special case of new autos, the May sales rate was well
below the level of underlying demands suggested by recent consumer buying
surveys and industry estimates, and early June figures indicate some
recovery beginning this month. Third quarter sales of new autos, which
will be stimulated by strong industry pressures to move exceptionally
large stocks of current models, are expected to be up substantially
from the current quarter, although far from returning to the high first
quarter rate. The run-off in auto stocks is likely to reduce the over-
all rate of inventory accumulation in the third quarter, just as the
build-up has caused a spurt in inventory investment in the current
quarter.
Prices and resource use
Pressures against resources remained strong through the second
quarter and prospects are for continuation of high levels of resource
utilization. Capacity utilization in manufacturing remains about 92
per cent and little change is in prospect. While the over-all unemploy-
ment rate has increased a little to 4 per cent, rates for primary labor
force groups are very low and are likely to remain so.
Sustained pressure on resources points to continuation of
price rises for manufactured materials and products at roughly the
rates of recent months. If labor contracts in major industries are
negotiated later this year and in early 1967 in an environment of strong

I-3
demands and high profits, increases in wage rates may accelerate, and
rising labor costs per unit of output would exert additional upward
pressures on prices of fabricated products. Prices of some materials,
on the other hand, which contributed so much to the recent rise
in industrial prices, are not likely to increase so rapidly in the period
ahead, especially if the strikes and other interruptions to supplies
of the past year can be avoided. Lumber prices have already turned down,
and hide prices have soared into a range in which the elasticity of
demand should limit further increases. Altogether, the rise in industrial
prices should remain close to the recent annual rate of about 3.5 per
cent.
Wholesale prices of foodstuffs showed some seasonal strengthening
in June, but the decline may be resumed soon in response to expansion
in supplies. With food prices declining, the total wholesale price index
has been virtually stable since February, and the over-all consumer price
index increased only 0.1 per cent further'in May and was 2.7 per cent
above a year earlier. Food prices declined while nonfood commodities
and services rose further.
Bank credit and deposits
Bank credit expansion over the second half of June is likely
to be quite strong. Loan growth is being spurred by business needs for
funds to pay income taxes and also to finance accelerated payments of
withheld individual income and social security taxes. Increased bank
purchases of liquid assets for window dressing purposes for end of June

I-4
statements will further contribute to credit expansion, as will delivery
of attractively priced agency and participation issues the final state-
ment week of the month.
While many of these asset acquisitions are temporary and will
be reversed in July, a relatively rapid growth in bank loans may
continue. The maintenance of demands for funds for capital outlays
and working capital -- in conjunction with apparently large reductions
in corporate liquidity associated with tax payments in March, April, and
June -- can be expected to be reflected in further strong business
demands for bank credit over the summer.
In an effort to finance such loan demands, banks
are likely to turn again to their security portfolios,
and to increase their efforts to attract time
deposits. It is not clear how strong an effort banks will make to
attract consumer-type time deposits in view of the growing public
concern over the effects of such competition on other savings institu-
tions. Nor is it clear how successful banks would be in attracting
increasing amounts of such funds in view of the intensified effort other
savings institutions could make to ward off another experience like
April. Banks could become more aggressive in the negotiable CD area,
where in order to replace maturing negotiable CD's -- let alone increase
outstandings -- they are likely to have to increase offering rates on
shorter CD's.

I -5
Outlook for capital markets
With the volume of new offerings in bond markets scheduled
to contract in the weeks immediately ahead, the general advance of
bond yields underway since early April has recently showed signs of
leveling off, and some yields have tended to decline. No appreciable
upward pressures on long-term rates appear likely over the near term.
However, any marked decline of corporate and municipal bond yields
would very likely encourage borrowers to add to the new issue calendar --
to help meet their continuing large current and future financing require-
ments. Consequently, the leeway for declines in long-term yields
at this juncture seems to be quite limited.
The slackening of prospective new issue volume, while partly
seasonal, seems to extend to all sectors of the securities markets.
For example, offerings of Federal agency issues and participation
certificates, which recently have exerted such an important influence
on interest rates, may drop in the third quarter to about half or less
of their second quarter volume. Moreover, issues of publicly-offered
corporate bonds thus far scheduled for July total only $200 million,
and the July calendar of municipal bond offerings also promises to be
quite light at the current reading. An offsetting influence in markets
to the relatively light calendar currently in prospect may be the need
for banks to make further portfolio adjustments -- in addition to obtaining
time deposits -- as loan demand continues.

I- 6
The recent abatement of yield pressures in other sectors of
the capital markets may also operate to reduce pressures on home mort-
gage markets to a limited extent. Credit conditions in the home
mortgage sector, however, will be most strongly affected by the size
of July net withdrawals from savings and loan associations.
Balance of payments
The merchandise trade surplus for April and May combined was
at an annual rate of only $3 billion, compared with $4-1/2 billion in
the first quarter and $5 billion in the fourth quarter of 1965. Exports
this year have been running below expectations, and little higher than
late last year, while imports have been increasing at an annual rate
of nearly 20 per cent.
The deterioration in trade in April-May would have produced
an increase in the over-all deficit on the liquidity basis had it not
been for shifts of funds by foreign official and international institu-
tions from liquid to nonliquid U.S. assets. The deficit on the basis
of official reserve transactions apparently did increase from the first
quarter to April-May, though the amount of the increase is still un-
certain.
Over the months ahead, the trade surplus is likely to re-
cover somewhat from the unusually low April-May level as export
expansion is resumed in response to strong demands abroad. But it may
not rise above the January-May average annual rate of just under
$4 billion. For all other payments flows, taken together, the prospect
is for some deterioration rather than improvement. Hence the liquidity

I -7
deficit seems likely to rise above the $2-1/4 billion level of the first
five months of the year.
Full balance of payments data are now available for the first
quarter of 1966. They show that the net outflow of U.S. private capital
remained at about the $3-1/2 billion annual rate recorded in the second
half of 1965. This is a low rate by historical standards, lower than
in any calandar year since 1959. Some further reduction is possible,
but it is not likely to be large as prospects are now viewed. Direct
investment outflows during the remainder of 1966 seem likely to exceed
the $2-1/2 billion rate of the first quarter. And while net outflows
into foreign securities have already declined from the first quarter
rate of $1-1/4 billion, which was swollen by a bulge in Canadian
new issues, reflows of bank credit appear to have diminished, taking
April and May together. Such reflows could increase again to the first
quarter rate, but seem unlikely to increase more than that.

THE ECONOMIC PICTURE IN DETAIL
The Nonfinancial Scene
Gross national product. We are now estimating GNP at a $725
billion rate in the second quarter and $739 billion in the third. The
$14 billion increase projected for the third quarter represents a
pick-up from the $11 billion rise indicated for the current quarter
but remains below the exceptionally large increases of late 1965 and
early 1966. In current dollars, the third quarter rise equals the
average quarterly increase during 1965, but with price increases
projected to be larger, the real rate of gain is lower. The rise in
the GNP deflator in the third quarter will be larger than in the
present quarter, in part, because of the way in which the cost of
Federal pay increases enters the national accounts; as a result the
increase in real GNP in the third quarter is estimated at an annual
rate of 4 per cent, as compared with a gain of 5-1/2 per cent for
1965 as a whole and 6 per cent in the first quarter of 1966.
The slowing in the second quarter came primarily from a
marked drop in the expansion in consumer spending. Total consumption
expenditures increased an estimated $4.5 billion as compared with
nearly $11 billion in the first quarter. The main feature was a sharp
decline in new auto sales. While there were presumably special in-
fluences in the auto sales decline--such as the safety issue and the
possibility of a let-down after the record buying in the first quarter--
the slower increase in consumer spending also was associated with

II -2
retardation in the rate of expansion in disposable income. Although
the rise in personal income slowed appreciably, there was an unexpectedly
large increase in the Federal individual income tax take, which further
limited the rise in disposable income. The ratio of spending to dis-
posable income was only a little below the high first quarter level.
Additional factors contributing to the second quarter slow-
down in over-all economic expansion were: a decline in residential
construction activity; somewhat less rapid expansion in business fixed
investment owing in part to strikes which limited the rise in business
construction; and a smaller rise in defense spending. Business inventory
investment, on the other hand, is estimated to have increased con-
siderably in the second quarter, because auto production was not cut
nearly as sharply as sales.
In the third quarter, growth in income is expected to
accelerate considerably, owing in part to Medicare payments and Federal
pay increases, and the rise in consumption expenditures is projected
at over $9 billion--double the second quarter increase but still below
the exceptionally large first quarter increase.
In the case of new autos, May sales appeared to be well
below the level of underlying demands as suggested by recent consumer
buying surveys and industry estimates, and partial recovery was
indicated in early June. Moreover, third quarter unit sales will be
stimulated by strong industry efforts to move the exceptionally

II -3
large dealer stocks. Sales of new domestic autos are projected at an
annual rate of 8.5 million units in the third quarter as compared with
an estimated 7.8 million in the second quarter and 9.3 million in the
first quarter.
Strong further expansion in business fixed investment is
anticipated for the third quarter, in line with recent surveys of
business plans and with rising orders and backlogs through May.
Short of any official information, we are estimating that, because
of the military pay raise defense purchases of goods and services
will rise in the third quarter somewhat more than in the second
quarter.
Limiting the rise in GNP in the third quarter is an
expected substantial further decline in residential construction
activity, in line with the sharp drop in housing starts to a 1.3
million rate in May, which also is assumed for the third quarter. And
business inventory accumulation is tentatively projected at a lower
rate in the third quarter, in large part because of the expected
large run-off of new auto inventories.

Industrial production. Industrial production increased in
May to 154.8 per cent of the 1957-59 average, nearly 1 per cent above
the upward revised April figure of 153.6 and 9 per cent above a year
earlier. Production of autos and parts declined, but output of most
other final products and materials advanced. This year, both industrial
production and the manufacturing component have increased at an
average annual rate of 10 per cent, with the rise slower in April
and May than earlier.
In May, auto assemblies, in response to the sharp decline
in sales, were reduced 7 per cent to an annual rate of 8.6 million
units. While some assembly plants have already closed down for
model changeover, scheduled output for June is at about the May rate.
Deliveries of new domestic cars declined sharply further in
May to an annual rate of 7.3 million units--down 20 per cent from the
high first quarter rate and 10 per cent below May 1965. In early
June, deliveries partially recovered to the 8.0 to 8.5 million range.
Inventories of new cars changed little in early June and on June 10,
at 1.7 million units, were 27 per cent above a year earlier.
Output of furniture, television sets, and some other home
goods increased in May. Both output and sales were about one-tenth
above a year earlier.
Production of business and defense equipment continued to
advance rapidly in May and were 17 and 27 per cent, respectively,
above a year ago. New orders for machinery and equipment rose
further and the backlog of unfilled orders was 25 per cent above May 1965.

II -6
Production of nondurable materials rose sharply in May while
output of durable materials as a whole showed little change, as declines
in output of parts for new cars and also in output of construction
materials offset increases in output of iron and steel and other
durable materials. Part of the sharp rise in output of nondurable
materials reflected resumption of work at coal mines where output had
been curtailed in April by a strike, but gains in other nondurable goods
lines were widespread.
Personal income. Personal income in May, at a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of $565.5 billion, was up about $2.5 billion from
April and $4 billion from March. The increase from March to May was
at an annual rate of about 4 per cent, well below the very rapid rates
of late 1965 and early 1966. Nevertheless, the May level was about 8
per cent above a year earlier.
In April and May, expansion in private wage and salary
disbursements slowed considerably as employment gains slackened,
in part because of strikes; farm proprietors' income declined mod-
erately following fairly steady increases earlier; dividend payments
showed little further rise; and transfer payments--which had increased
substantially last autumn and winter--were a trifle lower.
Retail sales. According to the advance monthly figure,
retail sales declined 2.5 per cent in May, bringing the total decrease
to 4.5 per cent from the March high. The May level was the lowest

II -7
since last October and was only 5 per cent above May 1965. The
dramatic upsurge in the winter months reflected in part the rise in
food prices.
The decline from March to May was concentrated in durable
goods stores with virtually the entire April decline at auto dealers.
In May, while a further decrease in auto sales accounted for the
major part of the drop, sales of other durable goods also fell off
and the total for all durable goods stores was 2 per cent below a
year earlier. Sales of nondurable goods were up slightly over the
two-month period, and the May level was 8 per cent above a year earlier.
Fragmentary indications for early June suggest moderate
recovery in sales of autos and other durable goods and some further
increase for nondurable goods. In the week ending June 11, total
retail sales were up 8 per cent from the corresponding year-earlier
week, with durables up 2 per cent and nondurables up 10 per cent.
Consumer credit. The slowing in consumer credit expansion
in recent months apparently continued in May, judging by data from
commercial banks. If bank-held credit accounts for about the same
proportion of the total as in other recent months, a seasonally
adjusted May increase of only around $500 million in total consumer
instalment credit is indicated. The average monthly increase in 1965
was $670 million.
Commercial bank delinquency rates are only modestly above
levels of two and three years ago, and are down from last autumn.

II -8
Latest ABA figures show that a usual seasonal reduction took place
this spring.
This week major New York banks raised most of their consumer
loan rates by one-half a percentage point. Increasesof a half a
percentage point also were announced by a Boston bank, to become
effective July 1. The quoted rate in New York is now 4.75 per cent
for direct auto loans (without credit life insurance), and 5.25 per
cent for most other secured consumer loans. Purchased auto paper
and personal loans (unsecured) were raised earlier this year, and
were not affected by the current change.
Consumer expectations. According to the May survey conducted
by the Survey Research Center of the University of Michigan, consumer
optimism has weakened significantly over the past six months. Their
Index of Consumer Sentiment, which was at a record level of 102 or
103 (Fall 1956=100) throughout 1965, declined to about 100 in
February 1966 and 96 in May. This index is based on answers to
several questions relating to short-term and long-term expectations
about business conditions, to past and expected trends in personal
finances, and to buying intentions. According to the Center, "all five
components of the Index have fallen significantly since November 1965."
For instance, there was a large decline in the proportion of consumers
expecting to be "better off" financially a year hence. The Center found
that awareness of higher prices and expectations of further price in-
creases over the coming year were a major influence on the deterioration
in consumer "sentiment."

II -9
A number of this survey's findings contradict the findings of
the Census mid-April survey of consumer buying intentions, and partly
in view of the much larger Census sample, the Survey Research Center's
findings are subject to some question. Thus, Census reported large
increases in the proportion of households with incomes above a year
earlier and with expectations of larger incomes a year hence. More-
over, Census found buying intentions for major household durable
goods unusually strong, while the Center reported a very sharp drop
in such intentions. The Center found a collapse in used car buying
plans, while in the Census report they were holding close to year-
earlier levels. The magnitude of the declines indicated by the Center
in household durable and used car buying plans alone makes them suspect.
Both surveys seemed to agree on a sustained high level of buying
intentions for new cars.
Orders for durable goods. New orders for durable goods in
May remained at the April level which was about 3 per cent below
the March peak. Shipments rose moderately in May, although not quite
back to their March high. Unfilled orders increased substantially
further but not so rapidly as in other recent months.
New orders for steel rose sharply in May, to about the highest
level reached in the steel inventory build-up period in late 1964
and early 1965. This large increase was surprising in view of recent
cutbacks in steel consumption by the auto industry and apparently
reflected strong nonautomotive demand. New orders for machinery and

II -10
equipment, which had shown an unusually large increase in April, edged
up further in May. On the other hand, defense ordering dropped sharply
from the very high rates prevailing in the first four months of the
year.
The May rise in unfilled orders was mainly in machinery and
equipment--continuing the earlier rapid increase--and in steel. The
defense order backlog held at the sharply advanced April level.
Business inventories. Business inventory accumulation is
expected to increase appreciably in the current quarter, owing largely
to the sharp but involuntary build-up in auto stocks. Book value
figures are now available only through April, when the value of retail
inventories increased about $180 million, little different from the
first quarter rate. Two-thirds of the increase was at auto dealers,
where stocks had been showing little change for some months.
Manufacturers'inventories increased $625 million in April
compared with an average monthly rise of $545 million in the first
quarter. The direction of change ran counter to manufacturers'
anticipations for the second quarter as a whole, when, according to
the May Commerce Department survey, producers anticipated an average
monthly increase of only $435 million. These anticipation surveys
have seriously underestimated actual inventory changes since mid-1965,
and it is quite likely that in the current quarter accumulation will
be at or above the first quarter rate. In April accumulation of work-
in- process stocks in defense and business equipment industries

II -11
continued to be important and it has apparently continued to expand
since then. Accumulation of stocks of materials by durable goods
producers picked up in April, following some months of little change--
reflecting in part the end of liquidation of steel stocks.
Construction activity. Seasonally adjusted new construction
outlays in May changed little from the revised (downward) April level
at an annual rate of $76.2 billion, they were 2 per cent below the
record reached last March but 6 per cent above a year earlier. These
estimates are very preliminary.
For residential construction, starts in May suggest a definite
weakening. Seasonally adjusted private housing starts dropped sharply
further to the lowest rate since January 1963. On a three-month moving
average basis, the rate was 1.46 million, about the same as the recent
low reached in the third quarter of last year. Even allowing for the
extreme volatility of the series, moreover, indications now are that
the indicated drop to a 1.3 million rate in May reflects further
declines in advance commitments built up earlier and increased lender
constraints on construction and related loans stemming from the still
tightening mortgage market. At best, this would suggest a second
quarter rate no higher than 1.40 million as compared with the first
quarter rate of 1.52 million.

Building permits also dropped further in May and were the
lowest since early 1961, with the year-to-year decline for single family
units particularly marked. Regionally, the declines were widespread for
both starts and permits and they were most pronounced in the Northeast.
While the relatively high rate of starts in April had raised
the possibility that a marked turn in this series might be delayed until
after midyear, the May shift was not entirely unexpected. Apart from
evidence of underlying mortgage market conditions, shown in the recent
Federal Reserve survey, an independent survey by the National Association
of Home Builders suggested that 6 out of 10 builders have made sig-
nificant downward revisions in their plans since last fall and
particularly since March, owing mainly to the altered mortgage market
environment. Four out of ten builders also stressed increases in labor
and material costs as a limiting factor. In addition, there have been

II -13
reports of increased numbers of would-be sellers of existing homes
withdrawing from the market because of the large discounts now involved
in sales transactions.
Labor market. Nonfarm payroll employment, after changing
little in April mainly because of strike curtailments, advanced
166,000 in May. Gains continued strongest in Government and manufacturing.
Employment returned to or increased from March levels in most other
industries, but declined further in construction.

Employment gains since March have generally slowed reflecting
strikes in some industries, the less rapid rate of growth in over-all
demands. In some sectors the slowing has been substantial as compared
with the pace of the preceding 2-month period. No further increase
has occurred in trade and there has been very little expansion in
finance and service. In construction, employment has declined
145,000 from its March peak, largely reflecting strike activity
during April and May. The less rapid expansion in manufacturing
employment since March has been specially marked in automotive-
oriented and building material industries; in the capital goods and
defense-related industries gains have continued strong.
The workweek in manufacturing edged down in May to 41.4 hours
from 41.5 in the preceding two months, largely reflecting reductions
in the automobile industry where the workweek was almost an hour
shorter. Generally, however, extensive use of overtime continued,
with factory workers averaging over 4 hours a week of overtime. This
amount of overtime was about the same as in other months this year and
well above a year ago.
Unemployment. Unemployment rose in May to 4.0 per cent from
3.7 per cent in April. Women and youths accounted for most of the rise;
for adult men (25 and over) the rate remained at the April low of 2.1
per cent.
Most of the May rise in teenage unemployment was among 14-
17 year old students, many of whom entered the labor force in search

II -15
of summer employment comparatively early and in greater numbers this
year. The jobless rate of this group rose sharply, to a level higher
than a year ago. By comparison, the rate for 18-19 year olds was
unchanged, and well below a year earlier. The increased unemployment
of both teenagers and women was primarily of short-term duration. Long-
term unemployment (15 weeks or over) declined further to a level a fourth
below a year ago.
Prior to March, differences in unemployment rates among
age-sex groups had been narrowing. Since then, however, differences
have been widening.

Collective bargaining. Labor-management contract settlements
negotiated in the first quarter of 1966 provided for larger wage increases
than those negotiated last year and indications are that in the second
quarter the average wage increase in new contract settlements will

II -16
widen further from a year ago. The proportion of all workers nego-
tiating contracts in any quarter is, of course, quite small.
Consequently, the effect on average hourly earnings will tend to appear
as the current pattern is extended to settlements later this year and
next.
In the first quarter, wage increases averaged 10-cents an
hour or 3.7 per cent per year over the life of the contract, compared
with an average rate of 3.3 per cent during 1965. In addition, contracts
in both years provided for improved fringe benefits.
So far in the second quarter, contract settlements appear
to have provided wage increases of 4 per cent or better. Recently,
Western Union, the Pacific Northwest lumber industry and Railway
Express Agency all signed contracts which provided for more than a
4 per cent wage increase. And in construction, recent settlements seem
to have been in the 5-6 per cent range.
Rising consumer prices are becoming an important factor in
collective bargaining. The higher than guidepost settlements in recent
months frequently have included provisions for some method of adjusting
for rising consumer prices. A number of recent contracts specifically
have provided for wage reopening whenever the CPI rises by a stated
percentage, as in the women's coat and suit industry. There is also
renewed interest in cost-of-living clauses. The electrical workers
are demanding reinstatement of such an escalator clause as a major goal
in their upcoming negotiations with GE and Westinghouse.

II -17
Workers now covered by escalator clauses--in auto, aerospace
and meat packing--will have received by midyear 6 to 7 cents in cost-
of-living adjustments this year, the largest since 1958. However,
only 2 million workers are covered by such clauses, about half the
number covered in 1958.
Hourly earnings in a selected group of nonmanufacturing in-
dustries--union and nonunion, high and low wage--have been averaging
about 4.5 per cent above a year ago. In manufacturing, hourly earnings
in May averaged 3.5 per cent above a year earlier. For both broad
sectors, the increases over the past 12 months have been moderately
greater than in the preceding 12-month period.

Wholesale prices. The industrial commodity price index has
continued to rise steadily at an annual rate of about 3.5 per cent.
From mid-April to mid-May it rose 0.3 per cent for the fourth con-
secutive month, reaching a level 104.2 per cent of the 1957-59
average. Estimates indicate a continuation of this rate of increase
into late June. Average prices of foodstuffs have continued to decline
from the February peak, and as a consequence, the estimated total
wholesale price index has changed little since then.
Average prices of machinery and equipment, reflecting strong
demand for capital goods, rose 0.4 per cent from April to May, and
increased about 2 per cent during the first five months of this year.
Prices of construction materials, also rising rapidly, increased 0.8
per cent in May and over 3-1/2 per cent during the first five months
of the year. Lumber rose again in May primarily because of the lingering
effects of the boxcar shortage and the anticipation of a strike; since
then, however, prices have declined. Prices of fabricated metal
products are continuing to rise, reflecting large unfilled orders and
increasing material costs.
Prices of a number of synthetic fibers are continuing to
fall sharply, reflecting significant economies of scale, and the
average for man-made fiber textile products in May was down about 6
per cent from a year ago. This decline has about offset increases in
other textile products, and consequently, the average for the entire
textile group has changed little during the past 12 months. Also

II -19
prices of both color and black-and-white television receivers recently
have been reduced by up to 10 per cent.
Average prices of foodstuffs are continuing to decline,
reinforced by seasonal reductions in fresh fruits and vegetables, and
by mid-June are estimated to be nearly 3 per cent below the February
peak. Livestock prices which were the major influence on the rise in
foodstuffs have remained on downward trends, although the reduction
in average prices was temporarily slowed by a seasonal increase in
hogs last month. Wheat prices in the past month have risen sharply
primarily because of deterioration in the crop of winter wheat, new
commitments to India, and rising commercial export demand.

Consumer prices. The consumer price index rose 0.1 per cent
from mid-April to mid-May and was 2.7 per cent above May 1965. The
rise was the smallest monthly increase since early last summer as foods
declined for the first time in 9 months. Prices of beef, pork, poultry,
eggs, and fresh fruits and vegetables fell, resulting in a 0.6 per cent
decline in food purchased in grocery stores and a 0.4 per cent decline
in the total for food which includes restaurant meals. In May, meat
prices were still 15 per cent above a year earlier, but further declines
are expected.
Average prices of services rose 0.3 per cent to a level 3.4
per cent above a year earlier. Medical care services continue to show
large increases, rising 0.5 per cent from April and 4.4 per cent from
May 1965. Mortgage interest rates, house repairs, and personal
services also contributed to the rise.
Nonfood commodity prices rose 0.3 per cent largely as a
result of further increases in apparel and footwear. Prices of new
cars declined about seasonally, and used cars rose less than seasonally.
Agricultural conditions. The only surprising development
revealed in the June 1 survey of crop conditions was deterioration in
the winter wheat crop prospects. For spring-planted crops, planting
delays and slow development were reported in some areas, but the effects
on output prospects were not considered serious. Pasture conditions
were normal over most of the country but exceedingly dry weather pre-
vailed in Kansas and adjacent states, the center of the winter wheat area.

II -21
The June 1 estimate of the winter wheat crop was 975 million
bushels, 11 per cent less than the May 1 forecast but only 5 per cent
less than the 1965 crop. Drought and frost caused most of the damage.
Since June 1, rains have benefited yields in some areas but have
impeded harvest in others. The spring wheat crop was estimated at
259 million bushels. For all wheat, a crop of 1,235 million bushels is
in prospect.
Supplies of spring vegetables for fresh market are 4 per cent
larger than last year and producers plan a 9 per cent expansion in
acreage of vegetables for processing. More potatoes are in prospect
in all growing areas and prospects for most deciduous fruits are
better than last year. The citrus crop, now largely harvested, is
substantially larger than last year and prospects for 1966-67 are
generally favorable.
Commercial output of pork and beef in May was about 4 per cent
larger than April, on a seasonally adjusted basis, and 10 per cent above
the very low level of last May. However, output of milk and eggs in
May was still running below year earlier levels. Reduced milk pro-
duction--below year earlier levels for the past 7 months--is reflected
primarily in reduced volume of CCC price support purchases; domestic
sales of fluid milk products, cheese, and frozen dairy products are
larger than a year earlier. Egg production is rising and in the third
quarter is likely to equal a year earlier and in the fourth quarter
to be significantly above a year ago.

II -22
Commodity market developments. Tightening supplies and
uncertain new-crop conditions revealed by the crop report released on
June 10 set off a wave of buying of future contracts, mostly wheat and
soybeans, but other grains as well, by exporters, speculators, and
commercial traders. Later, likelihood of damage to the wheat crop by
storms in harvest areas exerted further pressure on demand. An additional
fillip was given to the futures markets by the June 20 announcement by
Canada of a sale to Russia of a large amount of wheat for delivery
over the next three years.
Underlying the active trading in futures markets is a shift
in the supply position of most of the major commodities from one of
chronic surplus to one of closer balance with demand. In recent years
reductions in production by means of acreage diversion programs and
large exports have greatly reduced stocks of wheat and feed grains
held by the Commodity Credit Corporation. Soybeans, the one crop
with yields little improved from 20 years ago, has experienced
spectacular increases in domestic and export demand, and acreage has
expanded rapidly. In 1965, acreage in soybeans was exceeded only by
those in wheat and corn. The USDA has encouraged further expansion in
acreage in 1966.
The pinch in wheat supplies in prospect during 1966-67
marketing season stems mainly from the commitment of large supplies
to India. Big exports, three-fourths of them aid-financed, have been
the major draft on wheat supplies and if continued in the volume attained

II -23
in 1965-66 could reduce the July 1, 1967 carry-over below the 450-500
million bushel reserve considered desirable.

Action was taken by the USDA in early May to increase wheat
production in 1967 by increasing acreage allotments 15 per cent. More
recently, the USDA has announced that the size of P.L. 480 shipments
in the coming year will be gauged by supply prospects, mainly farmers'
plantings of winter wheat in response to increased acreage allotments,
and by weather conditions. Winter wheat normally makes up three-fourths
of the U.S. crop.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL SITUATION
Bank credit. In the two weeks prior to the June tax and
dividend dates, bank credit at weekly reporting banks declined contra-
seasonally -- mainly because of reductions in loans to government security
dealers and in banks own holdings of Treasury bills. Most of the
latter liquidation is thought to be centered at dealer banks. The
decline in these bank assets reflects the reduced inventories of
Government security dealers in the face of a large demand for the already
curtailed market supply of bills.
At New York City banks in the week ended June 15, however,
tax and dividend pressures were partially reflected in an increase in
bank credit of $1.5 billion -- about $500 million more than last year.
Loan demands were strong by finance companies -- who had to finance
maturing paper -- and by nonfinancial businesses. Continued demand for
bills by the public -- even in light of tax and dividend pressures --
and a generally reduced inventory position kept Government security
dealer bank loan demands quite modest, although the New York banks absorbed
about $350 million of bills, mainly for their own account. Part of this
increase, however, may have reflected acquisitions by banks for midyear
statement purposes rather than to accommodate customers in need of funds
for tax and dividend payments. The earlier than usual purchases of bills
for such purposes may be caused by the fact that several large New York
banks had reduced their bill portfolios to, or close to, zero.

III -2
Business loan expansion was stronger than usual the first
half of June -- particularly in metals, petroleum and textile industries,
and by miscellaneous manufacturing firms. However, the increase was
moderate in the week ended June 15 if one takes into account the extent
to which corporate tax liabilities were not provided for by tax bills
or maturing CD's and RP's. Tax liabilities not funded in this manner
were estimated to amount to $4.9 billion, or $1.3 billion greater than
last year, yet business loans at New York banks during the week ended
June 15 increased by only $67 million more than the expansion at the
same time in 1965.
Several factors seem to have been at work tending to moderate
business loan expansion at New York City banks that week -- at least
one of which is a statistical quirk. Comparable statement weeks in
recent years have ended a day or so past the tax date, while this year
the statement week ended on June 15. Some large firms evidently borrow
for tax purposes on June 16 which provides them with the needed funds
by the time their tax checks are cleared. Thus, the increase in business
loans during the week ended June 15 tends to understate tax borrowing
by some unknown -- but possibly appreciable -- amount.
The recent expansion of business loans was perhaps also
tempered by corporate build up of liquid assets for tax payments, in
part from funds obtained through the capital markets. Liquidation
of such assets were reflected in large in areas in finance company
borrowing at banks and quite large net declines in CD's around the tax

III -3
date. Stress may have been placed on asset liquidation in view of the
tight situation at many banks; particularly in New York City. All
of these factors suggest that a clearer picture of the extent of tax
period borrowing must await data for the statement week ending June 22,
and also of course from the non-New York weekly reporters for the week
of June 15.
Deposits and money stock. Private demand deposits increased
sharply in the first half of June, in large part because of more than
seasonal reductions in Treasury deposits. In the second half of the
month, the buildup in U.S. Government balances will tend to moderate
increases in private demand deposits, but for the month as a whole
such deposits are expected to expand at a 14.5 per cent seasonally
adjusted annual rate, and the money stock is likely to increase at a
12 per cent annual rate. If realized, this would indicate an increase
in the money stock for the first half of 1966 at a 4.5 per cent rate,
as compared to 4.8 per cent for all of 1965.
Time and savings deposits continue to expand at a rate
slightly below the 10 per cent rate of May. The pattern at weekly
reporting banks in evidence since mid-March of reductions in pass-
book savings accounts and increases in time deposits other than
negotiable CD's has continued.
Growth in outstanding CD's moderated sharply in June, reflecting
dividend payments and the needs of firms to prepare for tax payments.
Despite about the same quantity of CD's maturing at the tax date as

III -4
last year, the larger tax liabilities led to a very sharp $428 million
decline in outstanding CD's at New York City banks -- $260 million more
than last year. Quite scattered and modest increases in offering rates
on CD's in the most recent weekly report suggest that no strong effort
was made by banks to replace their maturing paper. This decision
evidently reflects on both the feeling by banks that corporate CD
demand would be so thin until after tax payments are completed as to
make strong efforts to replace maturing certificates not worthwhile,
plus a relatively comfortable position on the result of redeposits of
tax funds in Treasury deposits in New York banks.
All of the major New York banks recently have reported rates
at 5.50 per cent on 6-month and over CD's and most have only little
leeway below 0 ceilings in the 3- to 6-month area. However, according
to posted rates, New York banks have considerable room (25 to 50 basis
points) to increase rates on CD's maturing in less than 90 days. Most
other large banks also report offering rates 25 to 50 basis points
below Q ceilings in the under 90-day market and almost half of these
banks report offering rates below 5.50 on long CD's. However, our
survey also suggests that a good portion of these reported rates are
below rates at which banks are willing to negotiate for large blocks
of funds. This factor, plus sporadic reports of higher CD offering
rates, suggest that attempts of banks to accelerate CD inflows will
entail -- at present Regulation Q limits -- use of shorter CD's at
higher rates. A few banks have already started to use less than 90-day

III -5
maturities at rates above 5.25, and by June 22 at least three major
New York City banks were offering 5.50 per cent on CD's maturing in
60 to 89 days.
U.S. Government securities market. Yields have declined in
all maturity sectors of the U.S. Government securities market since
early June and bill rates currently are at, or very close to, their lows
for the year. In the note and bond area, a modest amount of net
investment demand developed earlier in the month for issues due within
5 years and this demand was supplemented by System purchases totaling
about $45 million. More recently, dealers have been net buyers of coupon
issues in all maturity areas and their positions in bonds due after 5
years have risen above $100 million for the first time since early April.
The general strength of the note and bond market in the recent period
has thus appeared to reflect mainly a turn to a somewhat more bullish
psychology among market professionals with respect to the near-term
outlook for banks. This attitude has been influenced in part by recurrent
rumors as to peace prospects in Vietnam and by such economic indicators
as the slower pace of auto sales. In addition, the good receptions
accorded recent corporate and Agency issues also provided a tonic to the
market.
Yields on Federal Agency issues have edged off their recent
peaks, as many previously hesitant investors apparently have decided to
commit funds at prevailing yield levels. Prospects of lesser supplies of
new issues in coming weeks have contributed to the firmer tone in this
market.

basis points
throughout the list since the beginning of June, is in part a seasonal
phenomenon. Treasury bill yields reach a seasonal low for the
year towards the end of June, reflecting a decreased market supply of
bills at the same time demands are strong.
The supply of bills outstanding will decline with the maturity
of $4.5 billion of June tax bills, some $2.0 billion of which are estimated
to be turned in for cash rather than utilized to pay taxes. Moreover,
the market supply situation has been currently aggravated by the very
low level to which dealer trading positions in bills have fallen. As of
* On June 22 the 3-month bill closed at 4.40 per cent.

III -7
June 20, such positions totaled only $587 million, and this has largely
divorced the bill market from any upward yield pressures that might have
resulted from the currently high financing costs to dealers.
The tax date itself passed with scarcely a ripple in the bill
market, as the small reported selling of bills was more than offset by
buying of bills for future delivery from holders of the maturing tax
bill. In addition, bill demand has been buttressed by reported purchases
by state and local governments who have temporarily reinvested proceeds
of recent security issues. Moreover, since early June the System has
been a net buyer of nearly $1/2 billion of bills in the market.
Yields on competing short-term debt issues, including CD's,
remained generally unchanged over the tax date and indeed are unchanged
since early June.

Corporate and municipal bond markets. As in markets for
Treasury and Federal agency securities, the tone of markets for other
types of bonds has improved recently. Yields on municipal bonds, after
rising in May and early June to within a few basis points of their 1966
highs, have since turned down slightly. While yields on new corporate
bonds have continued to advance in recent weeks to the highest levels of
the year, market participants are expecting some easing of pressures
in this market too once the current week's offerings -- which
represent nearly half of the June supply -- are out of the way.

number of other issues have recently sold out quickly, moving to
premium prices in the secondary market. With the volume of new offerings
scheduled to contract considerably in the weeks immediately ahead,
investors are expected to show an active interest in the current week's
supply of new corporate issues as well as in the new $175 million World
Bank offering.
For the month of June, publicly offered corporate bonds
are now estimated to aggregate about $850 million. This will represent
the largest monthly volume of such offerings in over four years. When
combined with anticipated private placements and corporate stock
offerings, it amounts to a record breaking total of almost $2.7 billion
gross corporate security offerings.
Corporate bonds scheduled for public offering in July, on the
other hand, now amount to only $200 million. While this volume will,
of course, be augmented as the month progresses, it may ultimately
total no more than the relatively moderate May calendar, but about
the same as the seasonally large July calendar a year ago. Looking
beyond July, issues with offering dates set for August already aggregate
more than $400 million (including the $250 million AT&T debenture) --
larger than the final August total a year earlier. Moreover, any
significant easing of yields in the corporate bond market at this
point might elicit further additions to the near-term calendar.

In the State and local government bond market, June volume
is expected to exceed that of June a year ago, but with both the
California and Public Housing issues now out of the way, the remaining
June supply is rather evenly distributed over the rest of the month,
and as yet offerings scheduled for July are quite light. At the same
time, dealers have succeeded in reducing their advertised inventories
to less than $500 million.

Mortgage markets. Mortgage markets have tightened further in
recent weeks as lender uncertainty about the direction and magnitude
of net flows of loanable funds has continued. Further information
now available for May (some of which is described in Appendix A)
tends to confirm the picture of conditions reported in the recent
Federal Reserve Bank reports on mortgage markets.
The rate of increase in mortgage yields since September has
been the sharpest in the postwar period and, by May, the structure
of yields was at a record high. For conventional first mortgages on
new home purchases interest rates were up 5 basis points further in
May, to 6.30 per cent. Except for a pause in January, such rates
have advanced by 5 or more basis points each month since September.
Rates on mortgages for existing homes have exhibited much the same
pattern and, in May, averaged 6.35 per cent, at least 5 basis points
above the earlier peak in late 1959 and early 1960.
Secondary market yields on 5-3/4 per cent, 30-year FHA-
insured home mortgages reached 6.32 per cent in May. This was 32 basis
points more than the average for comparable 5-1/2 per cent mortgages
in March and 86 basis points above the plateau which had persisted
through September of last year (when the contract maximum had been
5-1/4 per cent).
To keep its buying prices in line with the market, effective
June 10, the Federal National Mortgage Association lowered prices paid
to sellers of eligible home mortgages 2 percentage points further.

III -12
This reduction--equal to about 25 basis points on yield to the pur-
chaser--was the second such adjustment since early April and the
fifth (including three of 1 percentage point each) since early
December. Reflecting these and other adjustments (including the April
limitation on mortgages eligible for purchase to those with an unpaid
balance of $15,000), the volume of offerings of mortgages by private
holders to FNM has declined from earlier peaks. But in May the
volume was still more than five times as large as a year earlier. To
assure continuance of FNMA's support to the market, bills now before
Congress would permit an addition to FNMA's present borrowing authority
for this purpose of up to $2 billion.
Corporate profitability. Financial data that have recently
become available for manufacturing corporations suggest that the
substantial rise in corporate profits in the first quarter reflected
not only a higher level of activity but also a more rapid advance in
prices than in costs. Increasingly favorable price-cost relation-
ships have contributed significantly to the prolonged rise in profits
since 1961, and the leveling off or worsening of these relationships,
which occurred rather early in previous expansion periods, has been
notably absent, at least through early 1966. In the first quarter,
profits per dollar of sales, as well as rate of return on net worth,
were the highest in many years.
The ratio of profits before taxes to sales for manufacturing
corporations, which averaged about 9 per cent in 1964 and 9.5 per cent

III -13
in 1965, rose to 9.9 per cent (seasonally adjusted) in the first
quarter of 1966. This is the highest rate since late 1955 and early
1956. The ratio of after-tax profits to stockholders' equity in the
first quarter was just under 13 per cent (annual rate not seasonally
adjusted). This is the highest rate of return for any first quarter
since 1951. In these earlier years, of course, deductions for
depreciation were relatively much smaller than they are today. If
allowance is made for the liberalization of depreciation rules in
recent years (i.e., if profits are taken before deducting depreciation),
earnings per dollar of sales and per dollar of net worth were higher
in the first quarter of this year than in any first quarter since 1948.
Sooner or later, some combination of factors will undoubtedly
bring this persistent rise in profitability to an end. But thus far
the assortment of factors which typically exerted downward pressure on
profit margins as earlier postwar expansions progressed--substantial
wage increases, bunching of start-up expenses on new plants, less
rigorous control of various administrative expenses, increasing
inability to pass on cost increases in price advances--appear to have
been relatively unimportant for manufacturers as a whole. It seems
likely, given the moderation of economic expansion this spring and
the developing pressure on wages that profit margins will rise less
than seasonally in the current quarter.

III -14
Stock prices. Common stock prices have fluctuated in-
decisively since the Memorial Day holiday, at levels somewhat above
the yearly lows reached in mid-May. On June 20, Standard and Poor's
composite index of 500 stocks was 86.48, 3-1/2 per cent higher than on
May 17. But the index was still 8 per cent below the record high of
February 9.
The slower pace of stock-trading--which began after the
April market break--has continued into June. For the first three
weeks this month, trading activity on the New York Stock Exchange
averaged about 6.2 million shares per day, considerably below April
and May in which trading averaged 9.3 and 8.2 million shares per day
respectively. More recently, however, there has been some pick-up
in trading of the speculative issues so favored by investors during the
winter and early spring months.
The general weakening in stock prices and the dampening of
speculative psychology during May were accompanied by a decline in the
use of stock market credit. Customers' net debit balances were reduced
by $67 million and purpose loans at banks were cut another $19 million.
Moreover, a still preliminary tabulation of accounts in the New York
Stock Exchange margin panel shows a May decline in margin credit
amounting to $150 million.
Estimated budget results for fiscal 1966. Federal receipts and
expenditures, based on actual data through May have risen sharply on all
budget bases in fiscal 1966. National accounts expenditures rose almost

III -15
$12 billion, which more than matched the growth in receipts and led to a
slight deficit for the fiscal year. On a cash basis, payments grew
even more relative to receipts, and the deficit nearly doubled to an
estimated $5.4 billion.
The full employment budget moved in an expansionary direction
over the year. The surplus declined sharply between the first and
second halves of calendar 1965, primarily because of the sharp growth
in expenditures in the second half of the year. In the first half of
1966, the surplus remained at this very low level with further increases
in taxes and expenditures being about offsetting.
While most major expenditure categories are substantially on
target in relation to projections in the January 1966 Document, defense
expenditures have been running moderately higher than projected. And
on a cash budget basis, the government sponsored corporations--namely
the Federal Home Loan Banks and the three agricultural lending cor-
porations--are spending far in excess of their Budget projections. As
a result cash payments will be considerably higher than predicted
in January.
On the revenue side, all receipt figures are above Budget
projections primarily because of a higher than anticipated level of
GNP. The increase in cash and Administrative budget receipts is
further accentuated by the speed-up in payments of social security
taxes which was not explicitly planned in the January Document.

U.S. balance of payments. For the month of May, reserve
changes and the changes in liquid liabilities reported by a sample of
large banks show a deficit on the liquidity basis of a little less
than $100 million (not seasonally adjusted). For April-May combined
and after rough allowance for seasonal factors, the rate of deficit
appears to be not greatly changed from the first quarter ($2-1/4 billion,
annual rate). No report for the May deficit on the official settle-
ments balance is yet available.
The liquidity deficit was held down in April and May by
substantial shifts, amounting to more than $350 million, of funds of
foreign central banks and international institutions into time de-
posits with maturities of more than 365 days and into securities of
certain Federal agencies. Had it not been for these asset shifts the
April-May liquidity deficit rate would have been substantially above
the first quarter, when similar shifts amounted to about $150 million.
The merchandise trade balance in April-May was at an annual
rate of only about $3 billion, compared with $4.5 billion in the first
quarter. Although May exports were slightly larger than those of
April, while imports were down slightly in May, the underlying trends
measured by moving averages remained unfavorable.
Exports this year have been below expectations, despite
further strengthening of demand conditions abroad. Merchandise exports
in the first five months of 1966 averaged only about 2 per cent above

IV -2
the average for the second half of 1965, making an annual rate of
increase of 4 per cent over this interval. Imports, on the other
hand, had risen at an annual rate of 16 per cent.
New issues of foreign securities fell sharply in May and are
expected to rise only moderately in June. For the second quarter,
seasonally adjusted purchases of foreign securities -- almost wholly
Canadian -- are expected to be at an annual rate of about $900 million,
compared with the $1.5 billion average rate for the preceding two
quarters.
Detailed balance-of-payments data for the first quarter of
1966, together with revised data for earlier periods, will be published
in the June Survey of Current Business. As will be seen from the table
below, the deterioration in merchandise trade from the fourth quarter
to the first, and also a deterioration in military transactions and in
"other services" (mainly in travel), was approximately offset by a
sharp recovery in net receipts of income from investments. Hence, the
surplus on all goods and services remained at an annual rate of about
$6 billion. (Published GNP data, which now show net exports somewhat
larger than this, will be corrected in July.)

There was a small increase in net outflows of U.S. Government
grants and capital in the first quarter, and also an increase in net
unidentified payments--the "errors and omissions" item.
The net outflow of U.S. private capital was at a rate of
slightly over $3-1/2 billion in the first quarter, little changed from
the second half of 1965 or the year 1965 as a whole. This figure
includes the placing abroad of funds raised abroad through sales of
bonds by U.S. corporations. Such bond sales were at an annual rate
of nearly $3/4 billion in the first quarter; they are counted in the
balance of payments under inflows of foreign nonliquid capital. The
net outflow of U.S. capital less these foreign borrowings was at a
rate slightly under $3 billion in the first quarter. The proceeds of
the bonds will ultimately be used to finance direct investments abroad,
but only a small part was so used during the first quarter. The remainder
largely accounts for the outflow ("reported by others") shown on the
last line of the table below.

Prices and wages in industrial countries. In the first
several months of 1966, pressures of demand upon supply capacities
continued to be reflected in substantial price and wage advances in
other industrial countries. Only in France and Italy, where there
still exists some slack, were increases in consumer prices in the
twelve months from April 1965 to April 1966 below 3 per cent.

Part of the upward impetus on consumer prices was provided
by special factors: food prices rose substantially because of poor
1965 harvests, increases in world market prices for a number of raw
materials worked themselves through to the final product stage, and
in a number of countries indirect taxes and charges for public
services were increased as part of general anti-inflation programs.
Wholesale prices for manufactured products, perhaps a better indicator
of demand pressure, rose less than did consumer prices in several major

IV -5
countries. However, in most countries -- Britain being the chief
exception -- the rate of rise in wholesale prices of manufactures
has tended to accelerate since late last year.

A number of countries are supplementing their anti-inflationary
financial policies with attempts to control prices and wages directly,
either by regulation (France, and recently Belgium and the Netherlands)
or by suasion (United Kingdom). Voluntary postponement of certain price
increases in Britain seems, however, to be building up latent price
pressures. In France, where the system of price ceilings imposed in 1964
has been gradually modified, recent price advances may be partly a
reaction after the earlier repression, rather than solely a response to
current demand conditions.
Unit labor costs have continued to increase virtually every-
where. The labor market situation has remained extremely tight inI

IV -6
Europe, except in France and Italy; strong wage rises have outpaced
productivity gains. Only in Italy did unit labor costs actually fall,
as productivity rose sharply during the first year and a half of the
recovery (which began in late 1964). Wage increases in most countries
moderated somewhat in the summer and autumn of 1965. In the United
Kingdom, however, though average weekly earnings rose less rapidly
than before, basic wage rates advanced at an accelerating pace last
year and have continued to do so in 1966.

United Kingdom. The efforts of the British authorities to
moderate the upward movement of prices and wages with "incomes policy"
have had only slight success. The National Institute of Economic and
Social Research estimated recently that moral suasion efforts kept
prices about 1/2 percentage point below what they otherwise would have
been. No such estimates are available with regard to wages.

IV -7
Wage increases continue to outpace productivity gains by
considerable margins, and this is reflected in the continuing rise
in wholesale prices and in non-food consumer prices. In early June
reports from industrial buyers of increases in prices they pay
kept mounting, indicating that the period of voluntary restraint
may be coming to an end. When the payroll tax becomes effective in
the autumn, a further acceleration in the upward pace of consumer
prices is to be expected.
Wage settlements in 1966 have generally been well above the
Government's 3 to 3.5 per cent "guiding light," and average hourly
basic rates have been rising at more than twice the suggested maximum.
Recent awards obtained by the railwaymen and by the road-haulage
workers amounted to 6.5 and 7 per cent respectively.
Germany. Despite the leveling off since mid-1965 in domestic
new orders and the slowing of growth in output, particularly in the
capital equipment field, the upward movement of German prices and wages
has continued this year. As in other countries, a large part of the
increase in consumer prices has been due to higher prices for food and
services, particularly rent. However, the fact that wholesale prices
have been rising a little faster in recent months than before supports
other evidence that the period of slowing in expansion of demand may be
coming to an end.
The tight labor market situation and the continued upward
movement of prices have been encouraging further demands for wage
increases. Average hourly wage rates rose sharply between October and

IV -8
January, and were then 7.7 per cent higher than in January 1965. Since
January, however, wage settlements have generally been fairly well in
line with the 6 per cent recommended by the Council of Economic Experts.
But they still exceed the expected growth in productivity, which is
estimated at about 4.4 per cent between the years 1965 and 1966.
The Netherlands and Belgium. Continued inflationary pressures
led the Dutch and Belgian Governments this spring to impose direct
controls on prices and wages. In both countries the pace of price
increases had accelerated noticeably during the first four months of
1966. Although price movements were influenced in both countries by
increases in indirect taxes and higher charges for public services,
the acceleration was cause for concern since it appeared likely to
lead to wage increases, particularly in Belgium where most wage contracts
have an escalation clause.
In Belgium, a general price freeze was imposed for three
months starting May 6th. In addition, the Government will attempt to
roll back prices for certain major consumer goods; beef and pork prices
are already being reduced under the program. Furthermore, customs
duties and turnover taxes for certain consumer goods will also be
reduced and certain import quotas will be raised.
In the Netherlands, effective May 24th, wage increases are
not allowed to be passed on to consumers unless failure to do so would
prevent an efficient firm from earning a normal return on capital.
Until the end of 1966, price increases for goods sold domestically must
be reported to the Government with a detailed explanation of the

IV -9
increase (before this decree price increases were reported on a
voluntary basis).
No new collective wage agreements will be authorized in
the Netherlands before July 15 (under the current system all contracts
are subject to approval by the authorities); thereafter, new wage
contracts may not provide for increases in excess of 7 per cent.
Average increases in some 80 contracts approved thus far in 1966
amounted to 7.5 per cent, those awaiting approval or disapproval
averaged 10.6 per cent.
France and Italy. Resumption of economic growth in these
countries last year was coupled with large productivity increases
typical of the early stages of a recovery. Consequently, cost
pressures have not yet developed. In Italy unit labor costs have
actually declined; with unemployment still relatively large, wage
increases have been notably less than in preceding years, as the table
on page IV -6 shows. In France, where the margin of unused resources
is somewhat smaller, wages have begun to move up a bit faster.
Similarly, the rate of rise in Italian consumer prices has
been unusually low, by comparison both with Italian price changes in
earlier years and with prices in other European countries. In France,
a slight quickening of the tempo has become noticeable, particularly
on the wholesale level.
Japan. Renewal of expansion in economic activity after mid-
1965 was accompanied by some acceleration in the pace of increase in
non-food consumer prices. But since food prices at the consumer

IV -10
level have not risen much for about a year (after extremely sharp
advances in the autumn and winter of 1964-65), total consumer
prices have continued to show what is for Japan a relatively
moderate rate of rise -- 4-1/2 per cent from April 1965 to April 1966,
as compared with 7-1/2 per cent from early 1964 to early 1965.
Wholesale prices of manufactures have been rising less in
Japan, during 1964, 1965, and so far in 1966, than in most other
industrial countries. Important factors in a temporarily sharp rise
in the Japanese index between November 1965 and February 1966 were
increases for nonferrous metals, wood products, and rice. (Rice
prices are government-fixed.)

APPENDIX A:
FLOWS TO NON-BANK FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES
Preliminary data indicate that savings and loan associations
and mutual savings banks gained funds on balance during May and the
first half of June -- showing some of the usual seasonal tendency for
their net savings positions to improve relative to April. At both
types of institutions, however, the magnitude of recent net inflows
has continued to be much smaller than in comparable periods of other
recent years. This year-to-year shrinkage has continued to center
in California for the savings and loans, and in New York for the
mutual savings banks, as the bottom panels of Tables 1 and 2 show.
The savings and loan industry is presently bracing itself
for a large net outflow of funds in July. This outlook reflects a
general presumption that the usual patternof heavy gross withdrawals
(following termination of both quarterly and semi-annual interest
accrual periods at the end of June) will be accentuated as in April
by the diversion of funds to higher yielding marketable securities
and savings instruments at commercial banks. Since net withdrawals
from the S & L's during July last year greatly exceeded those for
April, the basis for present apprehension in the industry is clear,
In view of the special circumstances surrounding this year's
$750 million April net outflow at S & L's, there is considerable
uncertainty in the industry whether continuing competitive interest
rate pressures will combine with the usual seasonal patterns of larger
gross withdrawals to produce a significantly larger net outflow in
July. Some analysts believe that the present fear of possible
attrition in excess of $1 billion at S & L's is being exaggerated.
They argue: (1) that the bulk of the interest-sensitive money held
in large accounts at S & L's with quarterly interest accrual periods
may already have switched in April; (2) that S & L's with semi-annual
accrual periods have fewer large interest-sensitive accounts and are
generally located in geographic areas where interest rate competition
from commercial banks has been less intense and where holders are less
aware of opportunities for investment in marketable securities;
(3) that the commercial banks at which rates on savings instruments
have been advanced since April are less important and will probably
have a much smaller impact on shifts in savings flows than those which
had already raised rates before or during April; (4) that the recent
Home Loan Bank ruling providing increased leeway fo1 S & L's to
respond to rate competition (and still stay eligible for advances

at Home Loan Banks) will help to limit further attrition in S & L
savings capital; and (5) that pressure for further leeway of this
type may soon develop if the 5-1/4 per cent pass-book rate already
announced by a few West Coast associations should spread more
generally to other associations.
Other analysts are considerably less sanguine about the
July outlook. They note that because the general public typically
responds with a substantial lag to opportunities for profitable
substitution created by changed interest rate spreads, there are
probably many shareholders who failed to switch in April and are
now alerted to the opportunity they missed. The widespread publicity
given to recent increases in market yields, particularly those on
short-term Federal agency debt and participation certificates,
adds emphasis to this point. Moreover, there is some concern that
favorable corporate earnings reports for the second quarter will
stimulate renewed incentives to buy stocks at just the point when
share-holders in S & L's become free to switch without sacrificing
accrued interest. Finally, there is some underlying concern that the
recent spotlighting of S & L hardships might trigger loss of con-
fidence in the industry, leading to large withdrawals of funds
particularly from West Coast institutions.

A-5
To prepare for the expected July increase in S&L demands for
advances, the Home Loan Bank System has just raised $400 million of new
money in the market. This, together with its present holdings of Treasury
securities, gives the System total loan resources of nearly $1.5 billion.
In the event that this lending power should seem insufficient, industry
representatives have been assured that the Home Loan Banks would have
access to other funds and that there would be no shortage of money for
advances.
As Table 3 and the chart show, the volume of advances already
supplied by the Home Loan Banks this year has been much larger than in
other recent years. Not only did member associations lag behind previous
years in reducing outstanding advances during the first quarter, but new
borrowing since mid-March has been more than double that of a year ago.

Traditionally, savings and loan associations have relied heavily
on advances from the Home Loan Banks as a source of liquidity. But as
shown by the table below, they have also typically held liquid assets in
excess of the 7 per cent of savings capital (recently reduced to 6 per
cent) required by regulation. Even California associations, where gross
liquidity positions are among the lowest in the country, showed a gross
liquidity ratio of nearly 9 per cent at the end of April.

With all savings and loan associations holding $110 billion of savings
capital at the end of April, the Bank Board's recent temporary liberaliza-
tion in the required liquidity ratio (from 7 to 6 per cent) has the effect
of adding $1.1 billion of liquidity for withdrawals to the more than
$3 billion of excess liquid assets already available to S&L's throughout
the nation. This excess liquidity is particularly important now, since
the reduction in required liquidity ratios also requires associations
to meet withdrawals by reducing liquidity at least one per cent before
associations can secure advances from their Home Loan Banks.
The combination of (1) liberal loan commitments in the first
quarter -- despite slower net growth of savings capital, (2) unexpectedly
large net withdrawals in April, and (3) fear of even larger net withdrawals
during July has led savings and loan associations to curtail new loan
commitments drastically since April. The sharpness of this adjustment
has been accentuated by the April change in Home Loan Bank policy on
advances. This change directed member associations to limit outstanding
commitments "...to levels not exceeding the total of the previous calendar
four months loan repayments plus or minus their realized savings gains or
losses for the same past four months." Since both April and the expected
July experience enter into estimates currently affecting S&L loan policy,
it is not surprising that in the face of the great uncertainties with
respect to the July withdrawals -- new loan commitments have been
drastically reduced.

A-7
A recent survey by the U.S. Savings and Loan League revealed
that the 143 responding associations cut back their new loan commitments
by nearly 50 per cent in May, relative to May a year ago. This change
reflected a year-to-year decline of 70 per cent in commitments for
purchases of existing homes, multifamily structures, and for the refinancing
of existing homes; a decline of 45 per cent in construction loan commit-
ments; and a drop of 30 per cent in loan commitments for the purchase
of new homes.
While no continuing series on new loan commitments of S&L's
is available, comparison of the total backlog of outstanding commitments
at the end of April (latest date available) with repayments and net
savings capital flows for the January-April period suggests that new
loan commitments would become more readily available (given the new
Bank Board ruling on advances) if the July attrition in savings capital
should prove to be less extreme than some fear.
