of Governors of the Federal Reserve Syst em.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization proce ss which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain. 
 Please note that some material may have b een redacted from this document if that

tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing).

first created electronic text from the document im age.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, 
staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.  Pl ease note that the numbers and text in charts and

SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK
Outlook for GNP, prices and resource use
Developments over the past month have tended to confirm the
main outlines of the earlier GNP projection. Expansion is still expected
to accelerate in the current quarter; the staff estimate is for a
$14 billion increase, midway between the $11 billion rise of the second
quarter and the $17 billion rise of the first.
The main reason for this acceleration is the probability that
consumer spending--which was on the soft side in the second quarter--
will speed up sharply. The softening in consumer buying occurred in
April and May. In June, retail sales recovered somewhat as new car sales
increased substantially, nonfarm employment stepped up briskly, and
personal incomes rose more rapidly.
Personal income is expected to increase substantially in the
current quarter because of the Federal pay increases and the large boost
in prospect for transfer payments under Medicare and other Federal
programs. Moreover, the personal tax take is likely to show only about
half as large an increase as in the second quarter when the new withholding
rates were first put into effect.
A large rise in business fixed investment is in prospect for
the present quarter; such spending is likely to return to earlier targets
after a pronounced lag in the second quarter when business construction
was curtailed by strikes. In addition, the war in Vietnam continues to

I-2
intensify and July-September draft calls suggest further expansion in
the size of the armed forces. These developments seem to preclude any
slackening of the sharp upward trend in defense spending in the current
quarter.
On the other hand, the rate of inventory accumulation should
decline from the high second-quarter rate, as the large stock of 1966
autos is run down. Residential construction activity is also expected
to weaken further.
The projected expenditure patterns indicate continuance of
pressures on resources and the outlook for prices remains much as it was
a month ago. The utilization rate for manufacturing has remaind between
92 and 93 per cent. Employment increased sharply in June as a record
number of teenagers entered the labor force and most found jobs. The
over-all unemployment rate held at 4 per cent but within this total there
was a marked further decline in long-duration unemployment. Through the
summer, production will be affected by an unusually long model changeover
in the auto industry, and the unemployment rate by the movement of
students into and out of the labor force.
Industrial prices are expected to rise at a 3.0 to 3.5 per cent
annual rate. In the months ahead, prices of sensitive materials are not
likely to rise as rapidly as they did in the first five months of this
year and there is little that suggests an acceleration in the rise in
other industrial commodities. Prices of foodstuffs, however, may turn
down by the end of the third quarter.

I-3
Bank loans and deposits
Bank loan expansion may moderate over the months ahead. In
the immediate period ahead, a number of transitory influences will work
in this direction. These include ending of the unusually large business
loan demand associated with acceleration of payments on corporate income
and withheld taxes and also repayments of the recent exceptionally heavy
finance company borrowing. Lending to finance companies had been heavy
not only because of redemption of open-market paper around tax dates but
also because of an expanded over-all need for funds to cover floor-plan
financing of the temporarily enlarged dealer inventories of new cars.
Over the longer run, loan growth, at least at city banks,
probably will be less rapid than during the first half despite generally
strong underlying demands for credit. The recent surge of loan expansion,
together with the reduced liquidity of banks and the uncertain outlook
regarding the availability of CD funds, is causing many large banks to
reappraise their lending capabilities. Increasingly restrictive lending
policies are expected to result from these reviews.
Time and savings deposit inflows in the period ahead are
expected to recede from the accelerated rate of early July as one-time
transfers of funds at the mid-year interest-crediting period are completed,
with most of the slowdown anticipated to be at large city banks. The
Board's actions in raising reserve requirements and in reducing ceilings
on multiple-maturity certificates should have some dampening influence on
the attractiveness of time deposits to both banks and their customers.

I-4
In addition, the recent rise in yields on market instruments and on
savings accounts at nonbank institutions increases the attractiveness to
investors of such outlets relative to banks. Finally, negotiable CD
maturities remain large in this and the next two months, and banks may
encounter difficulties in replacing them--let alone building CD's
further--in view of the attractive yields currently available on Treasury
bills, agency issues, and finance company paper.
Outlook for capital markets
The tight position of commercial banks is likely to have
important implications for capital markets. More customers are likely
to be diverted from banks to the open market. Banks themselves may
reduce their U.S. Government securities holdings (for example, by not
rolling over all maturing issues in the August refunding) and may par-
ticipate less actively in the municipal and Agency markets.
Diminished bank interest has been a principal factor pushing
municipal yields to new highs in recent weeks. At recent yield levels,
a few borrowers have postponed scheduled financings. Any further rise
in yields might elicit other postponements and help to moderate the pace
of the yield advance.
In the corporate market, the relatively light July calendar
will be followed by heavy August offerings. The calendar for next month
is already in excess of $600 million--some $250 million larger than in
August a year ago. However, about two-fifths of the calendar is repre-
sented by one A.T.&T. issue that was announced some time ago, so that the
market may have discounted a good part of the impact of the August offer-
ings.

I-5
The Federal Government will also be in the market in the weeks
ahead with its mid-August refunding (to be announced July 27). While
just a little more than $3 billion of the maturing issues are in public
hands, market attitudes as to future interest rates are sufficiently
uncertain so that some upward adjustment in intermediate- and longer-
term yields could follow in the wake of the financing. Such an adjust-
ment would depend in large part on the nature of the offering, but even
restriction to a single short-term offering might require so attractive
a coupon as to occasion some switching out of bonds.
In home mortgage markets, recent pressures on lenders to
minimize new loan commitments may moderate somewhat if the net July
shrinkage in savings flows to all S&L's and mutual savings banks proves
to be no larger, or smaller, than in April. The availability of loan
funds at California savings and loan associations and at New York City
mutual savings banks has apparently not been as severely restricted by
early July net withdrawals as had been feared, presumably largely due to
responses to rate increases at those institutions. However, whether the
July experience of similar institutions in other parts of the country
was also better than expected is not yet known. In any event, mortgage
market conditions are likely to remain generally tight.
Balance of payments
The payments deficit for the second quarter is now tentatively
estimated at about a $1 billion annual rate on the liquidity basis, and
somewhere between $1 billion and $2 billion on the basis of official

I- 6
reserve transactions. The apparent improvement in the liquidity deficit
from its first-quarter rate of $2-1/4 billion can be fully accounted for
by an increased flow of foreign official and international institution
funds out of liquid claims on the United States into certain types of
claims classed as nonliquid--viz., into time deposits with original
maturities more than one year, and agency bonds or notes of over one-year
original maturity.
Since the magnitude of further net shifts of these kinds is
not readily predictable, the reduction in the liquidity deficit from the
first to the second quarter provides no guide to current trends. In
fact, apart from these shifts in U.S. liabilities, the other transactions
affecting balance of payments statistics would have produced liquidity
deficits in both the first and second quarters at an annual rate of about
$3 billion. There is no basis at present for altering estimates made a
month ago that the liquidity deficit apart from such shifts might continue
at about a $3 billion rate in the second half of 1966.
Trade data for June are not yet complete. Exports showed
considerable improvement from April-May, in line with recent projections.
Information on June imports will not be available until next week.

THE ECONOMIC PICTURE IN DETAIL
The Nonfinancial Scene
Gross national product. Gross national product is projected
at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $746 billion in the third
quarter, up $14 billion from the second. This increase is larger than
in the second quarter but smaller than in the first quarter in both
current and constant dollars. (See Appendix C for summary of the
Department of Commerce revision of GNP.)

of business inventories.
Consumer spending is the key factor accounting for the slower
rise in GNP in the second quarter and the anticipated acceleration in the
third quarter. These shifts in consumer spending correspond fairly

II -2
closely with changes in disposable income and, thus, the saving rate
showed little change from the first to second quarter and is expected
to increase only moderately in the third quarter. Disposable income
increased only $4-1/2 billion in the second quarter, as the rise in
personal income slowed markedly and the personal tax take showed an
exceptionally large increase. In the current quarter, the rise in
personal income is expected to accelerate again; gains in employment and
wages and salaries are estimated to be somewhat larger than in the second
quarter but are not expected to be so large as the sharp rates of
increase last winter. The rise in personal income will come mainly from
Federal pay raises and the large boost in transfer payments expected
under Medicare and other Federal programs. Moreover, personal tax
payments are expected to rise only about half as much in the current
quarter as in the second quarter when withholding rates were first
increased. Altogether a rise of $13 billion is projected for personal
income in this quarter with disposable income rising over $11 billion.
Moderate recovery in consumer purchases of durable goods is
expected in the current quarter, following the sharp second quarter
decline. Retail sales of durable goods began to rise in June as new
domestic auto sales recovered considerably from the reduced May level;
in early July, durable sales appear to have risen further. Moreover,
consumer purchases of nondurable goods, which showed only a small rise
in the second quarter, are expected to increase somewhat more, although
the projected rise is below the increases of late 1965.and early 1966

II -3
when food prices were increasing rapidly. Service outlays are expected
to continue to rise at a fast pace.
Business fixed investment is also expected to speed-up
again in the current quarter, following a short fall in the second quarter
mainly due to strikes in construction. Continued rapid expansion in
defense spending is projected, with part of the third quarter rise
reflecting the military pay raise. Other Federal purchases are up mainly
because of the civilian pay raise.
Residential construction activity is expected to decline
further in the current quarter as housing starts continue downward in
reflection of the tight mortgage financing situation. The rate of business
inventory accumulation is also expected to slow markedly from the high
second quarter rate, mainly because of the run-off in auto stocks from
their record midyear high.
The implied GNP deflator is projected to rise in the current
quarter at the same rate as in the two preceding quarters, In the current
quarter, real GNP is estimated to rise at an annual rate of 4-1/2 per
cent, as compared with 2-1/2 per cent in the second quarter and 6 per
cent in the first. Moderation of the rise in industrial production
and in nonfarm employment accompanied the slower growth in real GNP
in the second quarter. However, the real GNP growth appears unusually
small as compared with industrial production, which increased at an
annual rate of 8 per cent from the first to the second quarter and with
nonfarm employment which rose at a rate of 4 per cent.

Industrial production. Industrial production continued to
advance in June, and at 155.8 per cent of the 1957-59 average, the index
was up 0.5 per cent from May. On a quarterly average basis, the increase
in the index slowed to 8 per cent in the second quarter from 14 per cent
in the first quarter, as shown in the table. The pattern of slower
growth was widely distributed. Even business equipment showed some
slackening, although the rate of increase was still very rapid.

In June, output of both final products and materials rose
further. Business and defense equipment continued to increase and was
18 per cent above a year earlier. Consumer goods also generally continued
upward, with the exception of autos. Auto assemblies remained at the May
annual rate of 8.6 million units down 7 per cent from the rate in the
first four months of this year. Schedules for July, after allowance for
shutdowns for model changeovers, indicate a further decline in assemblies
of about 10 per cent.- --- --~--~-- ~ -

II -6
The July index could post a relatively large increase. The
seasonal adjustment factors allow for a 5 per cent decline from June to
July for the total index, but with unfilled orders at advanced levels,
plant shutdowns for vacations may be fewer than usual. The seasonal
factors would operate to influence the index in the opposite direction
in the following 3 months.
Personal income. Personal income rose to $576.5 billion
(seasonally adjusted annual rate) in June, $3.5 billion higher than in
May in terms of the newly revised figures. (The revised figures for May
and also the first quarter are $7.5 billion higher than reported before.)
The June increase was the largest since February. Most of the increase,
as usual, was in wages and salaries. Part of the increase in payrolls
reflected resumption of high level construction activity following
strikes; a larger-than-usual increase occurred in government payrolls.
Transfer payments were up somewhat and farm income down a little further.
Retail sales. Total retail sales increased one per cent in
June according to advance figures--recovering part of the sharp decline
in April and May. The June increase was at durable goods stores, where
the earlier decline had taken place, and within the durable sector most
of the fluctuations over the three-month period reflected marked shifts
in the pace of auto sales. In June, unit sales of new domestic cars
recovered to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 8.3 million units;
between March and May they had declined from a 9.2 to a 7.3 million rate.

II -7
In early July, sales of durable goods stores--and total
retail sales--appear to have increased further, although the durable
rise was primarily at furniture and appliance stores where sales of
air conditioners and fans were stimulated by the heat wave. Unit
deliveries of new domestic cars were down moderately to an estimated
annual rate of 8 million.
Inventories of new cars continued to rise in June and at
month-end were at 1.7 million units. During the first 10 days of July,
with production curtailed, inventories were virtually unchanged.
In recent months, total sales of nondurable goods have been
relatively stable, following the large run-up last fall and winter
which reflected in part rising food prices. Food store sales have
declined since April, while sales at general merchandise outlets have
increased moderately further. Sales at apparel stores in June were
at about the high reached early in the year.
Consumer credit. The expansion in consumer instalment
credit slowed further in May. The increase, $493 million, was
sharply less than a year earlier and the smallest since November 1964.
The slackening occurred mainly in the auto and other consumer goods
categories. Personal loan volume continued at a relatively high
level.

The pace of credit expansion apparently picked up again in
June as sales of autos and other durable goods recovered somewhat from
their recent lows. Preliminary reports from commercial banks suggest
renewed vigor, particularly in auto credit demands. Personal loan
activity was also quite strong in June.
The supply of funds available to lenders has continued tight,
and lenders in turn increasingly have adopted restrictive lending
policies. Maturity, downpayment, and other contract terms remain
essentially unchanged, but lenders have been screening applicants more
carefully than previously.
Finance companies have been turning more and more to the
commercial paper market to obtain short-term funds. And the commercial
paper rates have continued to rise. By early July, the rate for directly
placed finance company paper with maturities of 3-6 months had advanced
to 5.50 per cent; last September, it was 4.25. Very recently, Ford

II -9
Motor Credit Corporation posted 5-5/8 per cent on its long-term
(210-270 days) notes. This marked the first instance of a major
finance company raising its rates above those for comparable maturity
CS's. At the same time, some finance companies have moved to slightly
lower rates on shorter-term paper which has been less difficult to sell
recently as corporations have been showing a preference for shorter
maturities.
Business inventories. On a GNP basis, nonfarm business in-
ventory accumulation in the second quarter is estimated by Commerce at
a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $11.8 billion -- the highest in
many years and up $3.3 billion from the first quarter. Accumulation
accelerated at both manufacturers and retailers in the second quarter.
The book value of retail inventories increased over $500
million in May and for April and May the increase averaged $350 million,
as compared with $200 million monthly in the first quarter. The step-up
from the first quarter rate occurred in the durable goods sector. Auto
stocks showed a large run-up in April and May and continued to rise in
June despite considerable recovery in sales; stocks at furniture and
appliance stores also increased substantially. For autos as well as
furniture and appliances, inventories had shown little change in the
early months of the year.
The book value of manufacturers' inventories increased
nearly $700 million in May, as in April. This monthly increase compares
with an average of about $550 million in the first Quarter. The pick-up

II -10
in the rate of accumulation was in durable goods industries. Following
some months of little change, stocks of durable materials and supplies
rose appreciably in April and May, owing, in part, to termination of
the protracted liquidation of steel stocks which began early last fall.
Moreover, stocks of finished durable goods increased at a somewhat
faster pace than in the early months of the year. Work-in-process
inventories continued to rise at about the earlier fast pace.
Orders for durable goods. New orders for durable goods
continued to show little change in June at a level moderately below
the March peak. The new order level remained well above shipments and
unfilled orders expanded substantially further.
New orders for defense products rebounded to about the high
March-April level, while ordering of most other types of products
showed moderate declines. New orders for steel, which had risen
sharply in May, declined 7 per cent in June but the steel order back-
log continued to rise. New orders for machinery and equipment were
moderately below the record May level, but unfilled orders increased
sharply further.
Construction activity. Seasonally adjusted new construction
put in place, which on the basis of revised figures dropped 4 per cent
further in May, edged off again in June to an annual rate of $73.7
billion. This was 6 per cent below the high reached last March and
was the lowest rate since last October. Residential expenditures
apparently accounted for all the June decline.

II -11
The second quarter estimates most likely exaggerate the under-
lying decline in private nonresidential construction because of strikes.
Nevertheless, such outlays probably reached their peak in the first
quarter. Expenditures for public construction also have turned down
somewhat as rising financing costs have forced rescheduling of State
and local projects.

Private housing starts, which had dropped 14 per cent further
in May, edged off somewhat more in June to the lowest rate in the
past five years. The decline during the second quarter, which ran
somewhat ahead of initial projections, brought the average for the
quarter to an annual rate of 1.36 million. This was a tenth below
both the first quarter level and the average for 1965 as a whole.
There was a sharp further decline in building permits in
June to about the low reached in March 1960. Most of the decline was
in multifamily structures. As in May, all regions participated in the
June decline. The June volume ran uniformly about a fourth below a
year earlier.

Labor market. Demands for labor showed renewed strength in
June with employment gains accelerating sharply after having slowed in
the two preceding months. The increase in nonfarm employment was close
to the rapid first quarter rates. A large part of the employment rise
in June was associated with the additions to the labor force of a record
number of young workers seeking temporary summer jobs or beginning
regular jobs as the school year ended. Despite the flood of teenagers,
most of them were readily absorbed into jobs. The over-all unemployment
rate remained at 4.0 per cent, the same as May but well below the 4.7
per cent reported a year ago.
Nonfarm employment. Nonfarm employment increased by 324,000
in June, with gains in all major sectors. At an annual rate of 3.9
million, the rise in June was well above the increase over the past 12
months. The annual rate of increase in the second quarter amounted to

II -13
4 per cent, compared to 7 per cent in the first quarter, But even at
this somewhat slower rate of increase intensive pressure continued on
skilled labor resources.

Employment in manufacturing showed greater strength in June
than in any month since February, increasing by 110,000. While
employment gains over the month continued largest in the machinery
industries, primary metals also advanced considerably and the increases
in nondurable goods were larger and more general than in other recent
months.
Nothwithstanding further weakening in construction activity,
employment increased in June -- in part reflecting recovery from strikes
and bad weather -- following two months of declines. The level of

II -14
of construction employment in June was only slightly below the first
quarter and almost 150,000 above a year ago. The recent easing in
activity apparently has not, as yet, reduced skilled worker shortages,
particularly in the nonresidential sector. In trade, employment advances
also accelerated.
The stepped-up pace of government hiring has continued.
Adding to continued rise in State and local government,, growth has been
faster in Federal employment, which prior to June 1965 had been relatively
stable for a number of years.
Expansion in the Armed Forces has also absorbed a substantial
amount of manpower. Over 400,000 men have been added to the services
since August 1965 when the Vietnam build-up began. In June, the armed
forces total 3.1 million and were above the Budget projected strength
for the end of fiscal 1967 (3,093,000 by June 30, 1967). Announced
draft calls for coming months suggest about the same number as over the
past 10 months -- net additions of about 40,000 per month.
Unemployment. Because of the large rise in the teenage
labor force, resulting both from the larger population in that age
group and rising participation rates, unemployment among teenagers has
remained relatively high with only a slight improvement shown over the
past year. Reductions in unemployment among youths have been entirely
among white job seekers. Nonwhite youths have failed to share pro-
portionately in the employment rise and their unemployment has increased.
For example, the unemployment rate for 18-19 year old Negroes rose

II -15
from 27 per cent in June 1965 to 32 per cent in June 1966 (unadjusted).
For white youth of the same age the rate fell from 19 to 15 per cent.
While large additional supplies of temporary and relatively
inexperienced workers have been forthcoming, skilled workers are still
scarce and the number of adult males unemployed remain around frictional
levels. An important indication of tightness in the labor market has
been the rapid decline this year in the number and proportion of long-
term unemployed. At less than a half million in June, long-term
unemployment has declined sharply in the past two months and down almost
a third since the start of year. In June only 0.6 per cent of the
civilian labor force was unemployed for 15 or more weeks, the lowest
percentage since the end of the Korean War. In contrast, short-term
unemployment was significantly higher than earlier in the year and
accounted for the rise in unemployment from the April low of 3.7 per
cent. Consequently, a much larger proportion of temporary job seekers
and workers changing jobs are in the current unemployment total than
earlier this year.

Collective bargaining. Probably the most critical issue now
developing in collective bargaining arises from a widening differential
in wage rates among industries. In part, it reflects rather large
wage increases above the guideposts granted in some unionized sectors
in recent years (construction, teamsters, longshoremen), But even more
important are the differences which have emerged in the past year in
wage rates between workers whose contracts include cost-of-living
adjustments and those not so covered. The 2 million workers now covered
by escalator clauses are in large unions (auto workers, machinists,
teamsters) and in strategic sectors, Partly as a result of the rise
in CPI, basic wage rates of these covered workers have risen about
5 per cent in the past year. In current negotiations -- such as the
airlines dispute -- unions are pointing to wage gains which have already
taken place in comparable job classifications as justification for their
own large demands.

Without fanfare or publicity, the auto workers have had a
significant amount added to their basic wages. Over the past year, the
average basic wage rate in the auto industry (about $3.20 per hour)
has gone up 15.5 cents or almost 5 per cent (not including fringes).
Of this amount, 8 cents (2.5 per cent) have come from increases in the
CPI and 7.5 cents (2.4 per cent) from the annual improvement factor
effective last September. In September of this year, the auto workers
will receive an additional 10.5 cents from the annual improvement
factor. Thus, even if the CPI were to show no further rise, the auto
workers are already assured a wage gain of 16.5 cents or over 5 per cent
in the year ending September 1966. Contracts containing escalator
clauses similar to those in autos are in effect in meat-packing,
aerospace and agricultural machinery. Workers in these industries
have received wage rate increases comparable to those in autos,
The importance of this is that while the public may not be
aware of the size of the auto and similar escalator wage increases,
union officials are; Other unions are citing the auto gains in current
bargaining. It is hardly a coincidence that the machinists union in its
current dispute with the airlines has set a 5 per cent wage increase
and an escalator clause as its major bargaining demands. Not only do
the airline mechanics come from the same general occupational job market
as the auto workers, but the machinists union is also one of the major
unions in the aerospace industry, whose contracts generally provide
for CPI adjustment in wages. The airlines, however, continue to stand

II -18
on the recommendations of a government panel for a 3.5 per cent wage
increase--about in line with the guideposts.
While much has been made of the pattern-setting importance
of the General Electric and Westinghouse negotiations later this fall,
the auto wage gains already realized are likely to provide the more
important target in major negotiations this year. Even in the electrical
industry the rise of over 5 per cent in auto wage rates presents an
important goal for union negotiations. In the past, wage increases in
the electrical equipment contracts have been at the bottom of the
range of negotiated wage gains. This, in part, reflects strong and
determined companies bargaining with relatively weak and divided unions.
Also, the very high proportion of salaried workers and women employees
in the electrical industry tends to limit the wage gains of factory workers.
Wholesale prices. Industrial commodity prices continued to
move up in June, according to the comprehensive midmonth indexes, and
fragmentary information indicates that the rise has persisted since
mid-June. The average monthly increase through the second quarter and
through the first half of the year was 0.3 per cent, as the table in-
dicates. The increase was a little larger than that in May and a little
smaller in June. With prices of foodstuff unchanged in June and up
moderately in the first half of July, the all-commodity index has edged
up to a new high, estimated at 106.2 per cent of the 1957-59 average.
Sensitive materials edged down 0.2 per cent in June, after
increasing 3.5 per cent through the first five months of the year and

II -19
accounting for a disproportionately large share of the rise in the
industrial average. As had been anticipated, the sharp rise in lumber
was reversed in June and that in hides and leather was not extended.
The metals component of the sensitive index, which reflects mainly the
influence of copper and aluminum products, rose further. Industrial
materials other than the sensitive (three-fourths of total materials),
rose 0.3 per cent in June, the same as in each of the preceding two
months. The June rise reflected increases for petroleum products,
newsprint and other paper products, and plumbing equipment and brass
fixtures.
Among finished industrial products, producers' equipment
rose half as much as in May, but the increase equaled the average
monthly rise during the first half of the year. Consumer goods con-
tinued to move upward at a relatively slow pace, with much of the June
rise attributable to gasoline and nonalcoholic beverages. Consumer
durable goods generally remained stable.
The strength in prices of foodstuffs in June and July was
expected on seasonal grounds. Marketings of hogs in recent months
have been at a level that should prove to be the low preceding a
combined seasonal and cyclical expansion. Reports on the number of
cattle placed on feed during the first half of the year suggest expansion
in cattle marketings as well. The decline in prices of livestock and
meats was interrupted in June and the first half of July, and prices of
grains and dairy products rose appreciably.

Consumer prices. June figures are not yet available for the
CPI, but an increase in the total is almost a certainty. Early indications
are that food prices, after declining 0.4 per cent in May, increased
almost as much in June. Trade reports suggest that seasonal discounts
for new cars were somewhat larger than usual.
The increase in New York City's transit fares from 15 cents
to 20 cents will have a noticeable effect on the index for July. The
impact could be as much as 4.0 per cent on the public transportation
component and 0.005 per cent on the total index.
Farm production prospects. The July 1 survey of crop
prospects indicates that 1966 output may fall somewhat short of last year's
record harvest. Acreage in crops is down a little from 1965 and yield
prospects are extremely spotty. Yields will depend more than usually
on the timeliness and adequacy of rains during the rest of the season.Per cent change to June from

Among the big export crops, wheat and cotton production will
be smaller, feedgrains and tobacco about the same, and soybeans and
rice much larger than last year. Wheat prospects, widely watched
because of tightening world supplies and India's need for continued
large aid-financed exports from the U.S., improved slightly in June
but the crop may be down 7 per cent from the relatively large 1965
crop. A record rice crop is in prospect, 60 per cent in excess of
domestic needs. Total output of feedgrains will be close to last
year's record, with gains in corn offsetting declines in oats, barley,
and grain sorghums. Supplies for the year beginning October 1 will be
about 2 per cent below a year earlier because carry-in stocks are
being reduced by record feeding and exports this year,
Soybean acreage is 7 per cent larger than last year's record.
Demand has been very strong, however, and stocks of soybeans are
expected to be down to a month's use by September 1. Acreages of
other oilseeds are smaller this year.
Cotton acreage is down 25 per cent reflecting heavy
participation in this first year of the new 4-year acreage diversion
program, which was designed to bring the huge surplus under control.
A crop of 11.5 to 12.0 million bales seems likely as compared with the
15.0 million bale crop of 1965. Sharp cut-backs in tobacco acreages
last year were largely maintained this year in an effort to reduce
stocks. Larger crops of sugar cane, potatoes, vegetables for processing,
and dry edible beans and smaller crops of deciduous fruits and fresh
summer vegetables are in prospect.

II -22
Acreage in crop retirement programs this year amounts to
64 million acres, 5 million more than last year. Most of the increase
is cotton acreage and land put into the new cropland adjustment pro-
gram.
High-protein food output, third quarter. Record beef and
poultry production is expected to continue in the third quarter, and
pork production may climb above last year's low output as hogs from
the larger spring pig crop begin to reach markets. Production of eggs
and milk is likely to stay below year earlier levels although egg
production is trending upward. Milk production rose slightly in June
following 15 months of decline, but output was still 3 per cent below
last June. The recent boost in dairy price supports, the second this
year, represents an effort by the USDA to arrest the rapid shift of
resources out of dairying and to increase current production by making
heavier feeding more profitable. Current milk production is ample
for domestic use but leaves little surplus manufactured dairy products
for distribution in foreign aid programs.

Bank credit. Outstanding bank credit increased by $2.2
billion in June or at an 8.7 per cent annual rate, according to
revised seasonally adjusted data to be published in the July Bulletin
and reproduced in part in Appendix B. Although this growth rate was
a little faster than the average for earlier months this year, it was
well below the 10.2 per cent pace for 1965 as a whole.

$1.1NOTE: The changes in total credit and total loans described above,
in total time and savings deposits, described later in this report,
not reflect the exclusion from loans and time deposits on June 9 of
billion of balances accumulated for the payment of personal loans.

III -2
Expansion in total loans accelerated in June, mainly reflect-
ing direct and indirect financing of businesses. But banks were under
considerable restraint--from reduced reserve availability, a slackened
inflow of time and savings deposits (mainly at city banks), and a
seasonally adjusted decline in U.S. Government deposits--and to meet
loan demand, they made substantial liquidation of their investments,
mainly Treasury bills. Holdings of other securities also declined
slightly, the second monthly decline in this upswing according to the
revised bank credit series. Banks were not heavy buyers of new agency
issues late in the month, even though there was a large volume of
offerings at attractive yields; some bank selling of municipals was
also reported.
These portfolio adjustments occurred mainly at large banks,
however. Smaller banks, where loan demand has not strengthened
markedly this year and where growth in time and savings deposits has
been well sustained, added further in June to their holdings of other
securities at the same pace as a year earlier, and reduced their
holdings of Governments the same amount as in the comparable period
last year.
In the first two reporting weeks of July, data for banks in
New York City suggest that these banks have found it necessary to make
further adjustments in view of their tight reserve positions and of the
increase in reserve requirements effective July 14. They have made
additional reductions in their holdings of Treasury issues, contraseasonal

II -3
reductions in other securities mainly agency issues and long-term
municipals, and raised their rates on broker loans one-quarter percentage
point above the prime rate after having kept them identical over the
previous 3-1/2 months.
Business needs for bank financing were unusually heavy in
June, reflecting in large part the acceleration of payments on corporate
income and withheld taxes. Direct borrowing at banks by businesses
reached a record $2 billion, one-third more than the previous monthly
record. In addition, borrowing by finance companies mainly to cover
redemption of their maturing commercial paper held by businesses,
expanded by a record $900 million.
Moreover, in contrast with developments in past years,
business loans at city banks continued to expand into early July,
probably reflecting accelerated payments of withheld taxes. At banks
in New York City, business loans rose nearly $200 million in the first
two weeks of July this year in contrast with a decline of $140 million
in the comparable period last year.
To the extent that recent borrowing has been influenced by
temporary factors--the acceleration of tax payments and the build-up
in dealer inventories of new cars--the growth rate can be expected to
moderate in the coming weeks. While a generally strong undercurrent
of demand is expected to persist after these influences have abated,
another factor that may contribute to slower loan growth is a further
tightening of bank lending policies. Although fewer banks reported

III -4
that they were adopting more restrictive policies in the June lending
practices survey than in March, as shown in Appendix A, the percentage
of such banks remained high and the persistence of strong loan expansion
into July has probably resulted in reappraisal of lending policies and
further tightening at some banks since the June survey date.
Deposits and money stock. The money stock, after reaching a
new peak around the June tax payment dates, receded in subsequent weeks.
For the month as a whole, it averaged $171.1 billion, $1.6 billion
higher than in May but the same as in April. The June increase
presumably reflected the seasonally adjusted decline in U.S. Government
deposits during the month as well as the sharp loan expansion associated
with large June corporate tax payments. Over the first half of 1966,
the annual rate of growth was 4.4 per cent, a little below the 4.8 per
cent rate for all of 1965. While transactions needs have expanded
substantially over this period, growth in the money stock has been
held in check by the high opportunity cost of holding cash associated
with high and rising yields on money market investments.
Growth in time and savings deposits at commercial banks
slackened from May to June, and the increase for the month as a whole
was at an annual rate of 9.4 per cent, a little below the average rate
of growth over the first half. Growth at country banks was at an
annual rate of nearly 14 per cent, representing a considerable
acceleration from reduced rates earlier in the year, while growth at
reserve city banks declined further from the rapid pace of April.

III -5
The net increase in time and savings deposits at weekly
reporting member banks during the last week of June and the first week
of July was somewhat smaller than in the comparable weeks of March-
April. But within the time and savings deposit structure, shifts
among types of deposits were much less sharp than in the spring. The
decline in savings deposits and the increase in other time deposits
were each about $500 million less in the recent than in the earlier
period. The smaller growth in CD's accounted for most of the slower
growth in total time and savings deposits.

The pattern of smaller flows of savings and other time deposits
(excluding CD's), which prevailed in nearly all Federal Reserve Districts,
probably is attributable to several factors. These include (1) the
existence of only a moderate volume of delayed transfers of funds to
banks in response to rate increases that either missed out following
the March interest crediting or were not feasible until July owing to

III -6
semi-annual interest crediting; (2) the more aggressive competition,
of other savings institutions, through raising rates and introducing
new instruments, which served to moderate their deposit outflows; (3) the
increased relative attractiveness of market instruments; and (4) the
reduced incidence of bank rate increases and promotional activity in
June, compared with March, presumably in part as a result of the
threat of Congressional action.
By offering ceiling rates on large blocks of funds, at
relatively short maturities, when necessary, city banks were able to
replace most of their large mid-June run-offs of CD's by the end of
the month. The largest volume of CD sales in June, according to
the June 29 maturity survey, lead September maturities. These totaled
$1.2 billion, four-fifths as much as those for July and August com-
bined. Total maturities through September amounted to 56 per cent of
outstandings on the survey date.
Thus far in July, there has been some attrition in outstanding
CD's, possibly reflecting in part the recent rise in yields on Treasury
bills and on a number of other market instruments. In July 1965, out-
standing CD's had continued to increase steadily throughout most of
the month of July.

III- 7
U. S. Government securities market. Yields on U. S. Government
securities of all maturities rose to new highs over the past month, fol-
lowing declines in early June. Announcement of an increase in reserve
requirements against time deposits on June 27 triggered the turn-around
in yields, and yields rose further following an increase in the prime
loan rate to 5-3/4 per cent and removal of certain FHLBB restrictions on
S and L dividends. The market also was affected by a number of other
factors, including increased bombing in North Vietnam, an increase in the
British bank rate and talk of a discount rate hike. As prices declined,
dealers were able to reduce their holdings of coupon issues maturing in
over 5 years. Such holdings have declined by $150 million since June 27,
and are now at only about $25 million.

In the Treasury bill market, rates have risen sharply after
reaching a 4.33 per cent low for the year on June 27. New highs have
been set in the regular weekly auctions for three consecutive weeks. In
the latest auction the average issuing rate on the 3-month bill was
almost 5 per cent, but the bill traded below that rate subsequently.
With public demand for bills becoming more moderate and the
System on the selling side in recent weeks, the high dealer financing
costs began to bite and contributed to the rapid rate rise. Dealer
borrowing rates in New York reached a new peak of 6-1/2 per cent on new
loans, but have eased back slightly in the last few days. In view of
these high borrowing rates, dealers were reluctant bidders in the regular
weekly auctions and have been able to keep their trading positions in
bills at the very low levels reached in early June. To illustrate, bill
trading positions were at $523 million on July 18, less than one-third
their more typical year-ago level.
The System initiated last week the use of matched sale-purchase
contracts for the purpose of absorbing some of the temporary excess
reserves generated by the airline strike. Between July 13 and 19, the
Desk made $1,439million of such transactions and for periods as long as
three trading days. These sales would not be reflected in dealer position
figures, which are on a commitment basis, because they are matched by a
future purchase commitment.

Along with the rise in Treasury bill rates, yields on other
short-term credit instruments also rose, as noted in the table, except
for rates on new CD issues which were already at their legal ceiling.
Federal Agency securities market. A new high yield on a
Federal Agency security was set when the Federal Home Loan Banks priced
the $250 million 18-month portion of their $785 million July 12 financ-
ing to yield 5.80 per cent. Even at this high yield, reception of the
issue was only fair and the yield moved higher to around 5.84 per cent

III -10
shortly after it was offered. In this already congested market, the
Banks for Cooperatives had to place a still higher 5.90 per cent yield
on their $266 million 6-month issue, offered July 19. The issue was
very well received at that rate.
Treasury finance. The Treasury will announce its August
refunding on July 27. Outstanding maturities held by the public amount
to $3.2 billion. The nature of the financing will remain uncertain until
close to announcement in view of the current fluid market situation. The
Treasury will also be raising new cash toward the end of next month,
presumably through tax bills.
Corporate and municipal bond markets. Yield averages on
municipal and new corporate bonds rose about 20 basis points from mid-
June to mid-July, as market expectations of further near-term tightening
of credit intensified. Very recently, bond yields have stabilized--due
partly to the fact that the Federal Reserve discount rate was not raised
last week in advance of the imminent "even-keel" period of Treasury
refunding.

Upward rate pressures over the past three weeks were particularly
pronounced in markets for municipal securities, where yields on some out-
standing issues with short maturities rose more than 75 basis points.
While the volume of new municipal offerings has been smaller since late
June and is expected to show a continuing seasonal lull for the full month
of July as well as for August, dealers advertised inventories rose in
early July to more than $600 million. Since then they have declined some-
what, but the advertised figure reportedly understates the volume of
inventory which dealers would offer for sale if there were less risk of
triggering further yield advances.
To a considerable extent recent weakness in the minicipal
market reflected a tapering off of bank interest in new issues as well

III -12
as some outright selling of outstanding issues by money market banks
under reserve pressure from continuing loan demands. In addition,
however, recent Federal Reserve actions affecting time deposits raised
the question whether further increases in money market rates to levels
above 5-1/2 per cent would necessarily be matched by an upward adjust-
ment in the Regulation Q ceiling. Market participants are highly sensi-
tive to the fact that if the Regulation Q ceiling were not increased and
market rates continued to rise, the resulting bank liquidation of assets
would very likely be concentrated in the municipal market.
Given the uncertain outlook for yields, a number of smaller
municipal dealers whose capital positions had already been squeezed by
losses realized in earlier periods of rapid yield advance, reportedly
stopped bidding on new bond offerings in early July. Moreover, among
dealers who continued to bid, spreads between bids widened substantially.
In these circumstances, several sizable borrowers rejected all bids on
new offerings. Altogether postponements totaled $60 million in the first
two weeks of July, and with new additions to the calendar also tending to
slacken, the July volume is now estimated at only $700 million.

From mid-June to mid-July, yields on new callable corporate
bonds adjusted to a triple-A basis advanced nearly 20 basis points. At
these more attractive yield levels, the reduced volume of new publicly-
offered corporate issues elicited a more active investor interest and
underwriter's inventories of recently offered issues were fully dis-
tributed--though not without marked upward adjustments in their free-
market yields. As the overhang of unsold syndicate inventories was
reduced, the general tone of the corporate bond market improved.
Looking ahead, the expected July volume of publicly-offered
bonds (at $440 million) is almost one-third below a year ago, and
nearly half of this total consists of convertible debentures. In
August, however, new issue volume is expected to pick up again to a
level well above August last year. A large part of the August total is
accounted for by the $250 million A.T.&T. and $175 million Pan Am
issues--scheduled for offering early in the month.

Stock market. Common stock prices have fluctuated without
apparent trend in recent weeks, and at mid-July were little changed from
late May. On July 19, Standard and Poor's composite index of 500 stocks
closed at 86.33, about 3 per cent above the year's low reached in mid-May
but more than 8 per cent below the early February high.
Trading activity has continued quite moderate. Since mid-June,
the volume of trading on the New York Stock Exchange has averaged about
6-1/2 million shares per day, or roughly 30 per cent below the volume in
April when speculative interest in stocks was high. On the American
Stock Exchange, the decline in recent volume has been even more dramatic--
amounting to a 60 per cent reduction from the April average. Demand for
"blue chip" industrials and utility stocks has picked up in recent weeks,
however, following further price declines--in the case of utilities to
the lowest levels in three years.
Despite the narrow price movements and lower volume of
activity in June, the New York Stock Exchange margin panel shows a
(preliminary) June increase of $90 million in regular margin credit.
While customer's net debit balances declined slightly over the same
period, this probably reflected the effects of other forms of credit
which are not included in regular margin accounts. Thus, the increase
in special subscription accounts, generated by the $600 million of stocks
sold through "rights" offerings in June, was apparently not sufficient to
offset the sharp decline of clearing balances in cash accounts which
developed as a result of the June drop-off in trading activity. Clearing
balances represent temporary credit arising from the 4-day delivery rule
for settling stock purchases.

III -15
Mortgage market developments. Pressures on the mortgage
market mounted further in June and presumably in July, reflecting con-
tinuing lender uncertainties about the size of savings flows in the new
interest-accrual period now under way. Although recent changes in the
structure of competitive interest rates appear to have improved the
relative flow of savings to some important local mortgage markets, a
number of these markets are reportedly still quite disorganized.
Market uncertainties during the second quarter were accompanied
by a drop in net mortgage debt formation among the four major private
lender groups, according to tentative estimates to the lowest second
quarter volume in five years. The net increase for savings and loan
associations was probably less than half the rise in the peak second
quarter of 1963, and only the life insurance companies showed some year-
to-year advance. Moreover, acquisitions of mortgages by the FNMA are
reduced from their earlier highs as further adjustments in prices and
other purchase conditions were made to stem the flow of offerings of
mortgages to FNMA by private lenders. As a result, the sharp year-to-
year deceleration in portfolio growth of private lenders was only
partially offset by additions to FNMA holdings.

Pressures from the reduced availability of funds continued to
be most acute for government-underwritten home mortgages, despite a
further increase in the maximum contract rate to 5-3/4 per cent. In
June, secondary market yields for FHA-insured 30-year mortgages rose
13 basis points further to 6.45 per cent. This yield was a full per-
centage point higher than in June 1965 and was slightly above the average
contract rate (6.40 per cent) for conventional first mortgages on new
homes. Contract rates for conventional loans (excluding fees and charges)
also continued upward in June--an average of 10 basis points in the case
of loans on new homes, and 15 basis points (to 6.50 per cent) for loans
on existing houses.
While yield increases demanded by lenders have been pronounced,
shortening of mortgage-loan maturities in recent months have been slight,1966P

judging from data available through May. Also, although loan-to-price
ratios have tended to be less liberal, home purchase prices have con-
tinued generally upward--reflecting among ther things cost inflation
and upgrading--and average loan amounts have moved to or above earlier
highs.

Financial intermediaries. Midyear interest rate increases on
savings accounts at the New York City mutual savings banks and the
California State chartered savings and loan associations apparently
prevented end-of-quarter savings outflows at these two key goups of
institutions from ballooning to the proportions that had been feared.
The special significance of rate changes at New York City savings banks
is suggested by the comparative figures in the table. Thus, during the
end-of-June grace period, when only one of the largest New York City
banks had announced the move to a 5 per cent passbook rate, the net

III -18
outflow of savings for all 15 banks was larger than in the March grace
period and nearly double that of June a year ago. In the first 15 days
of July, on the other hand, when the new 5 per cent passbook rate had
become more general, the trend was reversed; the resulting net inflow
substantially exceeded that of the like period a year ago.
No comparative data for earlier periods are available for the
California State chartered S & L's, but members of the industry report
that net outflows during the June-July reinvestment period were both
less than expected and below the March-April volume. As the table shows,
about a fifth of the net shrinkage of savings capital experienced at
these institutions during late June and early July had been offset by
July 11. Announcement of higher passbook rates at the Californi S & L's
did not become general until after the July 4 holiday.
Given the recently improved position of California S & L's,
the question naturally arises whether associations in other parts of
the country--where dividend rates are generally lower-- have done as
well. To measure S & L experience for the country as a whole, the
Federal Home Loan Bank Board collected net flow data from a sample of 40
associations in each District. When this sample is blown up to represent
the more than 4,000 associations not surveyed, the Bank Board estimate
shows a net outflow at all S & L's in the first 8 days of July of
$1.2 billion. Because of the rough character of the blow-up factor
applied, this figure may be wide of the actual 8-day outflow by several
hundred million dollars. Moreover, since S & L's typically experience

some net inflow of funds following the period of concentrated withdrawals
early in July, the $1.2 billion estimate undoubtedly overstates the likely
attrition in savings capital for the month as a whole. Even so, it seems
clear that the net shrinkage of savings capital in July will be large.
Evidence on reduced savings flows to financial intermediaries
during the first quarter of 1966 suggested that much of the shrinkage in
flows to all depositary-type institutions developed from the competition
of yields on directly purchased marketable securities--with commercial
banks sharing in the general cut-back. While data on second quarter
savings flows suggest that competition from securities markets has con-
tinued to be important, flows to savings and loan associations, and
mutual savings banks also seem to have been substantially affected by
competition from the commercial banks. As the table shows, flows to
both the S & L's and mutual savings banks experienced a large' further
year-to-year contraction during the second quarter. Net flows to commer-
cial banks, on the other hand, showed a year-to-year expansion. As a
result, the commercial bank share of total flows to all three depositary-
type institutions jumped to 84 per cent, from 57 per cent in the first
quarter and 40 per cent in the second quarter of 1965.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
U.S. balance of payments. Preliminary information for June
(drawn partly from sample data) brings the second-quarter balance of
payments deficit to $270 million on the liquidity basis. After seasonal
adjustment, the deficit in the second quarter was at an annual rate of
close to $1 billion, compared with the first quarter rate of $2-1/4
billion.
This reduction in the deficit reflected an unusual bunching
of special transactions. Shifts of funds of foreign monetary authori-
ties and some international lending institutions into technically
non-liquid dollar assets (U.S. Government agency bonds and time
deposits maturing in over a year) reduced the liquidity deficit in
the second quarter by at least $500 million; shifts of funds by
international lending institutions in June, for which data are not
yet available, may increase this estimate. In the first quarter
similar transactions benefitted the liquidity balance by a smaller
amount, about $150 million. Apart from these shifts, the deficit in
each quarter would have been at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
about $3 billion.
For the first half as a whole, including the reduction of
the deficit by these shifts into non-liquid assets, the deficit was
at an annual rate of slightly more than $1-1/2 billion.
The stability of the deficit between the first and second
quarters (before reduction by these shifts) occurred in the face of a

IV -2
sharp decline in the trade surplus for April and May. For these two
months combined, the excess of exports over imports was at a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of only $3 billion, down $1-1/2 billion from the
first quarter. Other factors (including a possible improvement in the
trade balance in June) apparently improved by close to $1-1/2 billion
on balance between the two quarters.
Exports rose sharply in June -- reaching a seasonally adjusted
rate of $29-1/2 billion. However, for the second quarter as a whole,
exports were no higher than in the first. Examination of the area
distribution of exports, based on data through May, fails to shed much
light on the disappointing lack of growth; the moving averages shown in
the chart on page IV- C- have been generally rising since January for
all areas except Latin America. However, a comparison of exports for
the period January through May, with the same period in 1965 shows
that while total exports rose about 13 per cent, exports to
Canada, Western Europe, and Latin America rose at a faster rate,
while gains in shipments to less-developed countries in Asia and
Africa were smaller than the over-all average increase. Exports to
Australia, New Zealand and South Africa were down 14 per cent. The
year-to-year gain in total exports was concentrated in grains and
machinery. Aircraft exports, for which order backlogs have increased
sharply, were little changed.
Imports in April-May rose 4 per cent from the first quarter;
June data are not yet available. Much of this rise appears to have
reflected a resumption of imports of industrial materials which had

IV -3
been held down in the first quarter by sales from Government stockpiles
and by lower imports of steel. But imports of steel were higher in
April-May than in the first quarter, and imports of consumer durables,
other than autos, rose further.
Largely offsetting the effects of the decline in the trade
surplus was a reduction in new foreign security issues. Offerings
of new foreign issues, almost entirely Canadian, declined after April,
and for the quarter the net outflow was about $225 million seasonally
adjusted. This was only half the first quarter rate, which had been
swollen by postponements of some Canadian issues from late last year.
Foreign private purchases of U.S. corporate stocks, including
rights offerings, increased in April and May, to offset much of the
larger net sales from the official British portfolio. Total net
foreign sales of U.S. stocks in the first 5 months have been only
$85 million, less than half the rate of 1965, although net British
sales (possibly including some private sales) were $235 million in
the first 5 months, compared to $400 million for all of last year.
Foreigners made net purchases of more than $100 million of U.S. corpo-
rate bonds in the first five months of 1965 (in addition to the special
purchases of U.S. Government agency issues mentioned earlier). Through
mid-June, their purchases of new issues by domestic affiliates of U.S.
corporations established to finance direct investment abroad are
estimated at $300 million, implying some net reduction in their holdings
of other corporate bonds.
Net outflows of bank credit, which resumed in May, continued
in June, according to preliminary information under the VFCR. The net

IV -4
outflow of roughly $60 million in the second quarter was only about
equal to the normal seasonal rise. In the first quarter there was a
net reflow of about $250 million, seasonally adjusted. U.S. banks
continued to trim their rate of commitment on new term loans to
foreigners. In the second quarter, these commitments averaged about
$50 million per month, down from $70 million per month in the first
quarter and $100 million per month in the second half of 1965.

IV -5
Speculative attack on sterling. U.K. reserve losses since
the first of July have been the heaviest since the exchange crisis
in November 1964. The underlying cause of speculative pressure
has been the continuing rise in British wages and prices. The new
attack against sterling was set off by the announcement of a sizable
reserve loss in June, despite the use of central bank aid, and was
nourished by various evidences that U.K. policies for dealing with in-
flation and the balance of payments have not yielded hoped-for results.
A series of Government policy announcements on July 12 and 14
failed to bolster sagging confidence in sterling. On July 12, Chancellor
Callaghan announced that the ceiling on bank advances -- 105 per cent
of the March 1965 level -- would remain in effect until March 1967 and
until further notice thereafter. He also stated that contrary to his
plans last April, no special arrangements would be made with the banks
to help companies pay their initial selective employment tax liabilities,
which fall due in early September. On Thursday, July 14, the Bank of
England raised Bank rate from 6 to 7 per cent and at the same time
raised the special deposit requirements of the London clearing banks
from 1 to 2 per cent and those for the Scottish banks from 1/2 to I per
cent. This announcement brought only a temporary pause in the attack
against the pound, and late that day the Prime Minister announced that
his government would soon disclose new measures that would dampen private
and public spending in Britain and cut the foreign exchange costs of
national defense. The vagueness of this announcement contributed to
a further deterioration of market conditions on Friday, July 15. Selling

IV -6
pressures against the pound continued on July 18 and 19. The Govern-
ment's new measures, which are being made public as these notes go to
press, will be reported in the Supplement.
Current economic situation in industrial countries. In the
majority of industrial countries economic policies continue to be con-
centrated on holding down the inflation of wages and prices. This is
the case in Britain, Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Sweden,
and also in Canada. In some countries policies are being directed toward
a cautious restimulation of demand after previous periods of restraint;
these countries include France, Italy, Austria, and Japan.

Despite differences in inflationary pressures, expectations
for growth of real GNP in coming months, expressed in terms of the
annual rate of increase from the first to the second half of 1966,
cluster around 4-1/2 or 5 per cent with a few notable exceptions. In
Japan, growth of real GNP at an annual rate of about 9 per cent is
expected. In Britain and Belgium growth is expected to fall far short
of the average.
In April, industrial production was above its first-quarter
average in all countries shown in the table above except Britain,
Belgium, and Sweden. In most of the Common Market countries, annual
rates of increase in industrial production have been in the 5 to 10
per cent range since the third quarter of last year.
In Britain, total industrial production has been virtually
stable since October, with advances in output in some industries, includ-
ing machinery, offset by declines elsewhere. Since November, retail
sales (excluding autos) have moved up only slightly in volume. How-
ever, sales have risen more noticeably in value, as retail prices con-
tinue to rise at a rate of 4 per cent a year.
With the unemployment rate unchanged from January to June at
only 1.2 per cent of the labor force and with wages rising rapidly, dis-
posable incomes are continuing to increase. In March-April, average
weekly earnings in manufacturing were 9 per cent higher than a year
earlier. The basic problem of upward wage and price pressures remains
acute.
Private residential construction has been declining since the
end of 1964, but public authorities were still increasing housing

IV -8
construction throughout 1965. Non-residential fixed investment out-
lays,adjusted to real volume terms, have continued to rise in the
public sector (utilities, rails, communications), have fluctuated
without clear trend in manufacturing, and have tended to decline in
the private services and distributive trades.
The selective employment tax is expected to cause a rise in
prices for services and thereby restrain aggregate real consumption.
It will also tend to curtail investment further in the private services
and distribution sector. Other restrictive measures, including tight
credit as well as the new measures announced today, will check the rise
in public sector investment and are likely to bring a fall in manufacturing
investment.
In Germany business developments are mixed. Some signs suggest-
ing that the period of somewhat slower economic expansion may be coming
to an end are these: sharply increased foreign demand this year compared
with most of 1965; continued strong consumer demand supported by rapidly
rising wages; and a renewed uptrend in public construction, even in the
face of increasing financing difficulties. On the other hand, a further
slowdown in private investment demand appears to be occurring, particu-
larly in the investment goods sector itself. Symptoms of the over-all
easing of demand pressures, at least until lately, include the leveling
off in imports of materials and semi-finished products, and a slight
easing in the very tight labor market situation.
Industrial production, after remaining relatively stable
during the last nine months of 1965, began to expand again in early 1966.
In May, however, output was somewhat reduced from the high Marcy-April level.

IV -9
Germany's GNP, in real terms, in the first quarter of 1966
was 4 per cent above its level a year earlier. Construction activity,
which was hampered last year by bad weather conditions, was sharply
higher. Apart from this recovery in construction activity, the rate of
real GNP growth since a year ago is estimated at about 3-1/2 per cent.
With foreign orders flowing to those industries, such as
machinery, where domestic demand is weakening, not much further easing
of pressures on resources is expected. Consequently, German economic
policies will probably continue to remain restrictive.
Business conditions in France have continued to improve as
demand has expanded further. The major development has been a decided
revival in private investment demand, the first signs of which became
apparent in the last two months of 1965. Order backlogs in the equip-
ment industries have been building up rapidly, while at the same time
their output has risen sharply. The ten per cent investment tax credit,
applicable to deliveries of investment goods after February 15, has
added momentum to the underlying upward trend.
French private consumption demand remains strong, as employ-
ment is increasing (though the decline in unemployment since last autumn
has been only moderate) and the upward movement of wages is accelerating.
Only in those areas where growth was very fast in the latter half of
1965 -- for example, demand for automobiles -- does there appear to be
some slowdown. Residential construction, which was tending to level out
last year after a boom of several years' duration, may be declining
somewhat this year.

IV -10
The general outlook for the remainder of 1966 appears strong.
The National Accounts Commission recently revised its GNP estimates,
putting the rise in real GNP from 1965 to 1966 at 5 per cent instead
of the 4.5 per cent projected in September 1965.
Demand expansion in Italy continued to gather strength through
the first half of 1966. The available resources can still easily
accommodate substantial further increases in demand. Italy is thus the
only country on the European continent where renewed price pressures
do not -- at least for the moment -- present a policy problem.
The recovery continues to be carried by private consumption
demand: retail sales have expanded vigorously, and demand for new
cars has begun to rise again since the beginning of the year. Currently
there are signs that other areas of demand may also be strengthening.
Order backlogs for investment goods have been rising. Business surveys
since January have been increasingly bullish and show that producers of
investment goods expect a substantial advance in demand for equipment.
Building permits issued for residential construction, after
declining for two years, have begun to rise again and in December and
January (latest available) exceeded their year-earlier levels. Recovery
in construction will be especially helpful in reducing unemployment.
Economic expansion in Canada has continued at a fast pace
through the spring of 1966. GNP, in real terms, in the first quarter
of 1966 was 7 per cent above a year earlier, with private investment
outlays and exports up particularly sharply. While industrial production
has continued to increase rapidly, pressures on resources appear to
have increased. Order backlogs have risen. The unemployment rate, which

IV -11
was at 4 per cent by the end of 1964, declined further last year. Since
September 1965 it has fluctuated within a range of 3.3 to 3.7 per cent;
in May it was at the upper end of this range.
The Government has taken a number of monetary and fiscal
measures this year to restrain growth of demand. The Bank of Canada's
discount rate was raised in March. The 1966/67 budget reduced public
investment spending. A number of tax measures designed to postpone
private investment have been enacted, and the 10 per cent income tax
cut passed in 1965 was revised down for middle and above-average incomes.
An early reaction to tight money and rising construction costs
was a downturn in the value of building permits early this year, particu-
larly for residential construction, following a three-year advance to
a peak at the end of 1965.
In Japan, a strong upswing in industrial production has been
under way since last October. Following an earlier upturn in consumer
goods output, production of materials has been rising rapidly. Output
of investment goods has also increased.
Business profits have improved. In the six months ending
March 31, 1966, profits of 340 top corporations are estimated to have
been 15 per cent greater than in the previous six months, although not
as large as a year earlier. Although the number of corporate bankruptcies
has remained high, both the amount of debt per bankruptcy and the total
amount of debts involved have been declining.
Business inventory data for recent months show typical
responses to rising demands. Producers' inventories of finished goods

IV -12
fell 4 per cent from March to May, after changing little in the six
months since September. Raw materials inventories, on the other hand,
showed signs of rising this spring after remaining relatively steady
since mid-1964. Between February and May they increased 3 per cent.
Wholesale prices have continued to rise, increasing 0.6 per
cent in June to a level 4.4 per cent higher than a year earlier. This
12-month increase is an especially sharp rise for Japan.

APPENDIX A:
SURVEY OF BANK LENDING PRACTICES, JUNE 1966*
The results of the eighth quarterly survey of changes in
bank lending practices are summarized in the following paragraphs and
accompanying tables. Reports were received from the 81 banks included
in the quarterly interest rate survey.
Nearly three-fourths of the respondents (58 out of 81 banks)
reported a firming of loan demand in the second quarter of this year--
somewhat less than the record four-fifths in the first quarter. There
was also a decline in the number of banks reporting a firming in their
policies from the record numbers that reported such action in the first
quarter of this year. Significantly no bank eased policies during the
second quarter in any area covered by the survey.
These results may reflect in part the mid-June timing of the
survey at most banks. This preceded the late-June surge in loan demand
and the increase in the prime rate at the end of the month. Ten survey
banks reported their lending practices as of the beginning of July and
all of these indicated stronger loan demand and greater firming of
lending practices than was typical of banks that reported as of mid-June.
About four-fifths of the respondents stated that their
policies were firmer on both interest rates and compensating balance
requirements for business borrowers in the second quarter. In the March
survey, which immediately followed the March 10 raising of the prime
rate, all survey banks had firmed their policies on interest rates and
four-fifths on compensating balance requirements. Between three-tenths
and half of the banks also had tightened their policies on other terms
and conditions of their loans in the second quarter and more than half
of the banks indicated they were less aggressive in seeking new loans
and were less willing to make term loans than formerly.
In lending to finance companies, as in lending to other
businesses, fewer banks firmed their policies than in the first quarter
of this year. As in previous surveys, the firming affected finance
companies to a smaller degree than nonfinancial businesses.
In explaining changes in their policies a number of banks
commented on the limited availability of loanable funds in the face of
continued heavy demand for loans. One Chicago bank stated that it had
been compelled to turn down any sizable requests from new customers for
the past three months in order to take care of its regular customers.
In commenting on the heavy demand for loans one bank stated that many
of the new applicants came from outside its banking area and another
* Prepared by Caroline H. Cagle, Economist, Banking Section, Division
of Research and Statistics.

A-2
indicated that these applicants included a substantial number that had
been declined loans by their regular banks. In summing up the changes
in its lending practices, a large New York City bank indicated that
money market pressures and reduced liquidity had now become overriding
factors in loan decisions.

APPENDIX B:
REVISED SERIES FOR COMMERCIAL BANK CREDIT*
Seasonal factors have been revised for total bank credit and
for three major components. Revised data from 1948 to date will be
published in the July Bulletin, and references to bank credit in this
issue of the Green Book are based on the revised series. The accompanying
table provides revised data beginning with 1963 covering the principal
revisions.
The most noticeable change in the seasonally adjusted series
is in movements of total loans and investments around midyear. Seasonal
factors for June have been raised, reflecting increasing expansion of
loans to businesses, finance companies, and security dealers during the tax
and dividend period. The sharp reversal of June credit expansion in the
following month is reflected in lower seasonal factors for total bank
credit in July.
To some extent this reduced seasonal importance of July reflects
larger repayments of loans, although shifts in Treasury financing patterns
are the most important change influencing the July factors. Until recent
years, banks typically increased their holdings of U.S. Government
securities and their security loans in July, as the Treasury normally
engaged in large cash financings in that month and also sold 1-year bills
at midmonth. With these large cash financings shifted to other months,
and with the 1-year bill cycle changed from a quarterly to a monthly
basis, banks now reduce their holdings of U.S. Government securities and
security loans seasonally in July, For additional details regarding the
revision, see the description accompanying the revised date in the July
Bulletin.

APPENDIX C:
REVISION OF GROSS NATIONALPRODUCT AND NATIONAL INCOME ESTIMATES*
The national income and product accounts have undergone their
regular annual revision to incorporate data which have become available
since the earlier estimates were made. The revision covered the period
from the first quarter of 1963 to the first quarter of 1966 and the
earlier estimates of gross national product have been raised for each
quarter. The changes are typically small but the cumulative effect
is to raise the level of GNP in the first quarter of this year by
$7.3 billion to an annual rate of $721.2 billion -- 1 per cent above the
former figure. The increase in total GNP now shown for the first quarter
of 1966 is almost the same as the former increase.
The implicit price deflators were changed only slightly
during the revision period and thus, virtually all the revisions in
the current dollar estimates are reflected in the constant dollar figures.
Real GNP is now shown to have risen a little more rapidly throughout
this period than indicated by the earlier data.

The upward revision in total GNP in 1963 was largely due
to higher estimates for each major type of personal consumption
expenditures. And in 1964 and 1965 the durable and nondurable con-
sumption items were revised up slightly further. State and local

purchases of goods and services were also revised up somewhat in 1964
and 1965, while outlays for producers' durable goods were revised down
a little. The earlier estimates of investment in nonresidential
structures (construction) were also revised up in the latter half of
last year. The earlier estimates of change in nonfarm business
inventories were little changed for the period through 1965, but for
the first quarter of thi year the revised estimate if $1.1 billion
(annual rate) higher than the earlier figure.
The pattern of Federal defense spending was altered slightly
as defense purchases were revised up in the latter part of 1965 and
then down in the first quarter of 1966. The present second quarter
estimate, however, is the same as we were using with the older estimates.
Corporate profits and personal income were also revised up.
The present estimate of corporate profits for the first quarter of this
year is nearly 2 per cent higher than the earlier one. The new estimates
of personal income, both before-tax and after-tax, are 1.3 per cent
higher; less than half of the increase was in wages and salaries with
most of the balance in farm income, personal interest income, and transfer
payments. The personal saving estimate for the first quarter also was
raised somewhat, as the estimate of personal consumption expenditures
was revised up less than 1 per cent.
The revised figures show Federal government receipts on
income and product account to be a little higher than shown earlier
throughout all except the very early part of the period, while Federal
expenditures (total) were virtually unchanged. Thus, the revised
figures show the Federal surplus to be larger or the deficit smaller
than indicated by the earlier figures.
