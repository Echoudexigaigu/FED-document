SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK
Outlook for GNP
Despite various domestic and international uncertainties,
expansion in GNP is still expected to accelerate in the current quarter
and to maintain the stepped-up pace in the fourth quarter. The staff
projection is for a rise of around $14 billion in both the third and
fourth quarters, about midway between the $11 billion rise of the second
quarter and the exceptional $17 billion rise of the first quarter. In
real terms this projected growth is at an annual rate of 3.9 per cent,
a rate that would be accompanied by continued high levels of resource
utilization and strong upward pressures on prices and wages.
There appears to be no abatement in the pace of the increase
in defense spending. Both new and unfilled defense orders were very
strong in June. Stepped-up draft calls for September and October
suggest the likelihood of a continued build-up in the armed services,
at least through this year. By midyear, the armed services had
already attained the strength originally scheduled for mid-1967.
Business fixed investment is projected to rise much more
sharply in the second half of the year than in the second quarter, when
strikes curtailed construction. The projected rise is in line with the
latest official spring survey of spending plans (a new survey will be
available next month).
The rate of inventory accumulation, in contrast, is expected
to decline appreciably from the second quarter annual rate of $12 billion,

I-2
in part because dealer stocks of autos, which showed a sizable second
quarter rise, after seasonal adjustment, are assumed to show little
change in the third quarter. And residential building is expected
to decline significantly further, as mortgage markets remain tight.
Resumption of a more rapid rate of expansion in GNP is expected
in part to reflect renewed strength in consumer buying, stimulated by
a much greater rise in disposable income. This, in turn, comes from a
projected acceleration in personal income as well as a smaller rise in
tax and social security payments. Revised retail sales data for June,
now up 3.5 per cent from May, and the moderate further growth now
indicated for July are broadly consistent with this view on consumer
spending. The bulk of the projected expansion is in nondurable goods and
services. The staff has projected sales of new domestic autos at an
annual rate of 8.5 million units in the second half of the year, some-
what above the actual sales rate so far this quarter. The 1967 models
will have added safety features but also, presumably, higher price tags.
Resource-use and prices
The GNP projection discussed above points to the maintenance
of relatively strong demand pressures on industrial resources. Recent
expansion in industrial activity, although not so rapid as last winter,
apparently has been at least as fast as expansion of capacity. The
over-all unemployment rate has held at about 4 per cent, the rate for
adult males has remained close to a minimum, and the number of workers

I -3
unemployed for long periods has declined further. These conditions,
along with high profits, rising consumer prices, and wage escalation
in certain industries, increase the likelihood of an acceleration in
wage increases as new contracts come up for negotiation--a development
which would add upward pressure of labor costs to the existing pull
of demand on prices of manufactured materials and prodccts.
The recent rise in list prices for steel sheet and strip may
affect attitudes considerably more than costs. The successful chipping
away at the guideposts could be taken as a signal that market conditions
generally are strong enough to support price increases. The direct
effect of the 2 per cent increase in sheet and strip on the industrial
commodities index will be negligible, only 2 one-hundredths of 1 per
cent. The cost impact is concentrated on the auto and appliance in-
dustries; estimates of the impact on the cost of an auto range from
$2 to $5.
The steel-price increase was taken as an occasion for pre-
dictions of price increases ranging from $50 to over $100 for 1967
autos. Higher prices may affect markets even though the new safety
features will account for some part if not all of the increase. In
the consumer and wholesale indexes the amount attributable to the safety
features will be factored out as quality improvement. In setting prices
the auto companies presumably will be keenly aware of cost increases
that have occurred but also will have before them a recent record of
an appreciable decline in sales.

I-4
Bank credit outlook
The member bank credit proxy, on a daily average basis, is
expanding considerably less rapidly in August than in July or for the
year to date. Security portfolio liquidation and reduced loan demands,
the latter reflecting in part the smaller tax withholding payments
due from large corporations this month, appear to account for much
of the retardation. But with liquidity reduced and time deposit growth
slackening markedly at the large banks, increased credit rationing
may also be contributing to slower expansion or curtailment in some
loan categories. Total bank credit, on a last Wednesday basis, however,
is likely to show a sharp increase for August, since banks will probably
still have on hand a sizable part of the $3.0 billion of Treasury tax
bills to be auctioned this week, with full tax and loan credit, and
delivered just 4 days before the end of the month.
Business demands on banks over the remainder of the year--
particularly in September--are likely to intensify again, even in the
face of the rise in bank loan costs. Not only will the normal seasonal
fall loan expansion be underway--with more of business needs likely
to be reflected in demands for bank loans due to reduced corporate
liquidity--but September tax and dividend needs may also be more
difficult for firms to handle given their increased requirements for
funds for working and fixed capital.

I -5
Large commercial banks will find it increasingly difficult
to satisfy the loan demands expected to be placed upon them over the
next few months. Their security portfolios have already been sharply
reduced, as have their time deposit inflows; New York City banks have
actually suffered declines in time deposits since midyear. Money
market banks probably will be unable to roll over all of their large
September maturities of CD's, under present Regulation Q ceilings, and
this may add greatly to the pressure on bank positions. Increased
demands for credit, low bank liquidity, reduced time deposit inflows,
and the general level and direction of market rates of interest, there-
fore, suggest a further squeeze on credit availability at large banks,
of which this week's increase in the prime rate is one symptom.
These developments should tend to redirect credit demands
from large banks to the market, which may push market rates up further
and make it even more difficult for banks to sell CD's at present Regula-
tion Q ceilings. Under such circumstances, money market banks can be
expected to tap all possible sources of funds. The possibilities include
more aggressive bidding for Federal funds and for foreign official
deposits and Eurodollars obtained through foreign branches (both exempt
from Regulation Q). Most big banks also have room to raise rates paid
on consumer-type time deposits further, unless prevented from doing
so by regulatory or legislative action. More loan demands are also
likely to be directed to banks outside of money market centers, which
since late spring have been much more successful in obtaining time
deposit money.

I-6
Securities markets prospects
The underlying supply-demand influences which have recently
been exerting such marked upward pressures on interest rates in
securities markets can be expected to persist in the weeks immediately
ahead. In fact, they may be intensified by further shifts of
credit demands from banks to the capital markets as a consequence
of the prime rate increase and the possibility that major banks will be
unable to replace heavy September CD maturities.
Depositor reinvestment of the proceeds of CD liquidation
would tend to exert a downward effect on some short-term rates. Also
new issues of regular Federal agency debt are likely to be in substan-
tially smaller volume over the next month. But these downward rate
influences would very likely be offset by additions to market supply
resulting from the imminent Treasury cash borrowing, by the bank
portfolio liquidation needed to cover the deposit withdrawals, and by the
dislocations in existing demand-supply relationships that would result
from any abrupt squeeze on bank positions would bring.
Pressure on bank liquidity positions have already exerted a
marked recent impact on municipal bond yields, both through a sharp
cut-back of bank participation in new debt offerings and through steady
city bank liquidation of outstanding municipal bond holdings. The
resulting sharp rise in tax exempt yields has caused a few postponements
of new issues and has attracted increasing demand from individuals and
bank trust departments, but not in sufficient volume to halt the yield
advance. Any sizable run-off of CD's at larger banks can be expected

I- 7
to concentrate bank portfolio liquidation in the municipal bond market,
further accentuating recent rate tendencies.
Pressures on bank liquidity positions also may be forcing
some business borrowers into new capital market financing, at a time
when general business demands for long-term funds and reduced insti-
tutional investor interest in private placements are also greatly
expanding the volume of publicly offered corporate bonds. The supply
of such offerings now estimated for August is about $1 billion, the
largest monthly total for the year, and underwriters report that Sept-
ember public offerings are also likely to be unusually large. Since
interest rates in the market for public offerings tend to adjust more
quickly than those in the private placement market, the heavy volume
of public offerings has and can be expected to continue to accentuate
the rise in corporate bond yields.
In the mortgage market, the extreme concern which preceded
the July reinvestment period at depositary-type financial intermediaries
was moderated by the better than expected savings experience of mutual
savings banks in New York State and of savings and loan associations
in California. But the July savings experience of S&L's in some other
parts of the country was considerably less favorable than in California.
And with yields on market instruments rising so sharply since July,
the attraction of direct market investment for savers is likely to work
against any significant rebound in savings flows to depositary-type
institutions. With life insurance companies also heavily committed and
under pressure from business demands, the availability of mortgage funds
is likely to continue very limited.

I-8
Balance of Payments
The payments deficit on the liquidity basis was at an annual
rate of roughly $3 billion in July and continued large in early August.
The contrast with a deficit rate of only $1-1/2 billion for the first
half year reflects the fact that that figure was held down by large
shifts of funds by foreign official and international institutions
from liquid to nonliquid claims on the United States.
The balance on the official reserve transactions basis has
behaved differently. From a deficit of nearly $1 billion (annual
rate) in the first half year, it swung into very substantial surplus
in July, as foreign private liquid funds were attracted to this country
in unusually large volume, mainly through the foreign branches of U.S.
banks. Much of this inflow was probably the counterpart of the heavy
drain on U.K. reserves. Unfortunately, the emergence of an official
settlements surplus did not relieve the over-all pressures on U.S.
reserves or on the dollar in foreign exchange markets. While the
official claims of the United Kingdom on this country diminished,
those of other countries continued to increase, partly because of
uncertainties about sterling, and the System made extensive use of
its swap arrangements.
The outlook for the months ahead is for continuation of a
liquidity deficit in the $3 billion range. The merchandise trade
surplus recovered a little in June to about the average rate for the

I-9
first half year, but no early further recovery from that level is
expected. The renewed outflow of U.S. bank credit that developed in
the second quarter may be checked again soon; but there may also be
some increase in outflows through transactions in foreign securities,
which were unusually low in the second quarter (thanks partly to
advance redemptions by the Canadian Government).
Given a continued large liquidity deficit, the balance on
official reserve transactions is likely soon to swing back into
deficit. U.S. banks will doubtless seek to draw further on the
Euro-dollar market, but they are unlikely to be able to continue
to do so at anything like the July pace, or even at a pace sufficient
to match the liquidity deficit, particularly if the new British
economic program ultimately succeeds in reversing some of the earlier
flight from sterling. Thus, further declines in the U.S. gold stock
and further use by the System of its swap lines are to be expected in
the months ahead, in addition to U.S. drawings of $350 million from
the IMF during August-October (confidential untilreleased).

THE ECONOMIC PICTURE IN DETAIL
The Nonfinancial Scene
Gross national product. After rising $17 billion and $11
billion (revised) in the first two quarters of 1966, GNP is projected
to increase by about $14 billion in each of the last two quarters.
The implicit GNP price deflator is expected to continue to
rise at an annual rate of 3.5 per cent. Real GNP is thus projected to
grow at an annual rate close to 4 per cent in the second half of 1966,
about midway between the first and second quarter growth rates.
Most components are expected to increase in the third and
fourth quarters. Only residential construction activity and the rate
of inventory accumulation are projected to decline.
In the projection, consumer spending, which expanded very
little in the second quarter, is shown as expanding rapidly in the third
quarter, although not quite so rapidly as in the first quarter. Changes
in nondurable consumption are in accord with anticipated increases in
disposable income. Service outlays are shown to increase at a somewhat
faster rate than previously because of the beginning of payments under
the Medicare program. And expenditures for durable goods turn up again
after the second quarter decline.
Sales of domestically produced autos in the second half of
1966 are projected at an annual rate of 8.5 million, up a little from
the second quarter and also from July. The greater discounts being
offered this quarter will operate to prevent the dollar value of auto-
mobile purchases from increasing as rapidly as sales of physical units.

II -2
However, these unusually large discounts coupled with widespread
expectations of price increases for 1967 models should operate to stimulate
sales of remaining 1966 models and possibly to draw some sales away
from the normal fourth quarter purchases of 1967 models. In the fourth
quarter, prospective price increases -- partly or wholly for new safety
features -- will cause the dollar value of auto purchases to rise
relative to unit sales. While these new safety features may stimulate
sales in the fourth quarter price increases are likely to discourage
them. Consumer purchases of other durable goods are projected to show'
only a modest growth.
Defense spending increases shown in the projection are in line
with recent experience and the higher draft calls recently announced.
Other Federal purchases are expected to increase sharply from the second
quarter level, when exceptionally large CCC sales of agricultural
commodities (entering the GNP accounts as deductions from Federal
expenditures), resulted in a decline in nondefense Federal purchases.
These CCC sales are not expected to be as large in the remainder
of the year.
A somewhat greater increase in fixed business investment than
in the second quarter is expected for the second half, as indicated
by the latest quarterly plant and equipment survey last May. But the
prospective continued tightness in availability of mortgage funds is
likely to result in continued decline in residential construction
expenditures.

II -3
The rate of inventory accumulation is projected to decline
from the exceptionally high $12.3 billion rate of the second quarter to
a level of $9.5 billion in the third quarter. The buildup of dealer
stocks of new U.S.-made autos to a record high accounted for $1.3 billion
of the second quarter's inventory accumulation.
AUTOMOBILE SALES, PRODUCTION, AND INVENTORY CHANGES

If sales of domestically produced cars in the third quarter are at an
annual rate of 8.5 million and announced production schedules hold
(see estimates shown in table), there will not be any liquidation, on
a seasonally adjusted basis, of the heavy volume of automobile inventories
currently in dealer's hands. Thus, roughly $1.3 billion of the $2.8
billion third quarter decline in the change in business inventories

II -4
is attributable to the fact that automobile inventories will have
stopped increasing.
Other categories of business inventories in general do
not appear to be high relative to sales. A decline is assumed,
however, in the rate of accumulation of inventories in two areas
which have shown the fastest rate of growth, specifically work in
process at machinery and transportation equipment manufacturers and
materials at durable manufacturers. The second quarter increase in
materials at durable manufacturers seems to have brought these
inventories in line with sales.

Industrial production. Industrial production in July was
157.5 per cent of the 1957-59 average, 0.8 per cent above the upward-
revised June figure of 156.2 per cent and 9 per cent above a year earlier.
Increases in output of equipment and materials were substantial, as
vacation shutdowns probably were fewer and shorter than usual. Output
of consumer goods declined slightly.
Auto assemblies, after allowance for the early model change-
over, declined 10 per cent and, at 152 per cent of the 1957-59 average,
were almost one-fifth below a year ago. Schedules indicate that output
will remain at a reduced rate in August but will increase to 165 per
cent in September and be back up to 185 in October, or to an annual
rate of 9.4 million units. If these schedules are realized, the
August-October rise in auto output will add about .6 of one point to
the total index.
The scheduled recovery in output is based mainly on a planned,
rapid building up of stocks of the new models, a more rapid build-up
than a year ago. The 1967 models go on sale in late September and
early October.
Among other consumer goods, output of television sets and
furniture also declined in July in what appears to be a temporary move
as retail sales of furniture and appliances, which had declined in
April and May, rose in June and then advanced further in July to record
levels. Production of consumer nondurable goods increased further in
July.

II -7
Output of both business and defense equipment continued their
upward pace and were 17 per cent and 25 per cent, respectively, above
a year ago. In May and June, new orders for machinery declined slightly,
but they were still higher than shipments and unfilled orders con-
tinued to increase.
Production of iron and steel, as well as most other materials
advanced further in July. Output of construction materials, however,
remained at the somewhat reduced level prevailing since May.
Wholesale prices. The wholesale price index jumped 0.7 per
cent from mid-June to mid-July as the average of prices for foodstuffs
rose more than 2 per cent and returned to its February peak; industrial
commodities rose only 0.1 per cent further. Since mid-July, according
to the weekly estimates, indexes for the total and for both industrial
commodities and foodstuffs have changed little.
The slowing down of the rise in industrial commodities --
from an average of 0.3 per cent a month in the first 5 months of the
year to 0.2 per cent in June and 0.1 per cent in July -- reflects in
the main a reversal in sensitive materials. The sensitive index de-
clined 0.5 per cent from May to July after rising 3.5 per cent in the
preceding 5 months.
It would be premature, at the least, to interpret the decrease
in the sensitive index as indicative of a general easing in demands.
The decline was concentrated in lumber and plywood and in hides and
leather -- two groups which earlier had risen very sharply in response

II -8
to certain actual and threatened supply problems as well as to
strong demands.
The metals component of the sensitive group was unchanged
in July, after rising more than 4 per cent in the first half of the
year. Pressures in copper markets appear to be easing. Prices abroad
had been sustained at very high levels by curtailment in shipments from
Zambia and a threat of a strike in Chile. But recently, Zambia has
yielded to its own need for foreign exchange and has increased shipments
through Rhodesia, and a strike in Chile has been averted. The economic
program in Britain may also be having an influence -- by creating
expectations of lower consumption of the metal and by reducing incen-
tives to hold copper, even at high prices, as a hedge against sterling.
Prices of refined copper have declined sharply in most markets abroad,
but they remain well above prices in this country. In domestic markets,
scrap prices have declined.
Prices of other industrial materials -- which are three
times as important in the index as the sensitive materials -- continued
upward in July at a pace slightly less than the 3 per cent annual rate
of the first half of the year. Prices of plumbing and heating equip-
ment and paper products rose further. In early August, prices of steel
sheet and strip, comprising a third of all steel shipments, were
raised 2 per cent. In consequence the index for all steel mill pro-
ducts will rise.5 per cent to a level 3 per cent above that of 1959-60.
Prices of finished industrial products rose only .1 per cent
in July, after rising 1.3 per cent during the first six months of the

II -9
year. Monthly increases for producers' equipment have been erratic;
since the beginning of the year they have ranged from .2 per cent
(March, April, and July) to .6 per cent (May). Among consumer goods,
prices of apparel rose slightly further but gasoline declined while
other nondurable goods and major durable goods were stable.
Increases in prices of foodstuffs were widespread in July;
indeed, the only exceptions were livestock and meats, which declined
slightly. Prices of milk and dairy products continued to increase in
response to reduced supplies. Grains rose 9 per cent, partly because
of the effect of adverse weather in reducing crop prospects but also
as a result of general recognition that carryover stocks of wheat at
the end of next season will be extremely low unless actions are taken
to reduce exports under foreign-aid programs. In response to the
prospective reduction in the carryover and of strong export demands,
the Secretary of Agriculture raised the 1967 wheat-acreage allotment
by an additional 15 per cent -- a total increase of a third from the
original allotment.

Employment. Nonfarm employment continued to expand vigorously
in July. The gain would have been about 110,000 higher but for the
airline strike and the beginnings of an early shutdown of automobile
plants for model changeover. After allowance for these developments,
the July seasonally adjusted gain was close to the average monthly
increase of 270,000 since January of this year.
In manufacturing, advances in employment were heavily
concentrated in the capital goods produc ing industries, as in other
recent months. The average factory workweek has edged down from the
first quarter average of 41.5 to 41.2 hours in July.
In services and government employment gains continued to be
large and in trade employment moved up moderately further. Construction
employment changed relatively little this month, but average weekly
hours of work increased somewhat. In transportation and public
utilities, employment declined by 67,000, reflecting the effects of the
airline strike.
Unemployment. The over-all unemployment rate, at 3.9 per
cent in July, was virtually unchanged from the 4.0 per cent rate of
May and June, but down sharply from the 4.5 per cent rate of a year ago.
Unemployment has shown little change now for about half a year --
ranging between 3.7 and 4.0 per cent -- and stability in unemployment
rates has been characteristic of most major groups in the labor force.
Unemployment of nonwhite workers, however, has risen almost a percentage
point since the beginning of the year to 7.9 per cent in July.

II -11
Contrasting changes in the age-sex composition of the
civilian labor force, employment and unemployment over the past year
are evident in the table below. The net increase in the civilian labor
force was entirely teenagers and adult women; the number of adult men
participating actually declined, largely because the increase in the
adult male population was small and because many of the 400,000 added
to the armed forces came from this group.
With these changes in the civilian labor force, increases
in employment came largely from the groups of teenagers and adult
women, although managements in many cases would have preferred to employ
adult men having desired types of skill and experience.
Unemployment of adult men, already approaching a frictional
level a year ago, was reduced further and there was also some decline
in the number of adult women unable to find jobs. The number of teen-
agers unemployed did not change but with more of them in the labor
force, their rate of unemployment declined somewhat.

Hourly earnings in manufacturing. Average hourly earnings
of production workers in manufacturing have increased 3.4 per cent
over the past year, with advances for major industries ranging from
1.9 to 5.0 per cent. Increases in hourly earnings reflect, in addition
to higher wage rates, increases in overtime and other premium payments
and shifts in employment within and among industries; for manufacturing
as a whole, overtime averaged 3.7 hours in July as against 3.4 hours a
year ago, with hours up more in some industries such as machinery,
electrical equipment and textiles but less in some other industries and
actually down in the auto industry. Wage rate increases higher than the
3.2 per cent guidepost have occurred mainly in industries in which wage
settlements have recently been concluded or which have long-term
contracts with CPI escalator clauses. Wage settlements this year have
been considerably higher than in the same period last year and for
industries individually have been well above those granted in the
previous contract.
Gains in hourly earnings have been sharper in nondurable
goods industries than in durables. In food, petroleum, textiles and
tobacco, earnings have gone up 4.5 per cent or more. The large increase
in food reflects in part a substantial rise in the meat-packing
industry where wages are tied to CPI. In the rubber and apparel
industries, where wage increases so far have been small, wage negoti-
ations are scheduled early next year.

In the durables, an earnings increase of about 4.5 per cent
in lumber reflects a recent wage agreement. A similar rise in machinery
reflects recent agreements in parts of that industry and also increased
overtime and escalator clauses in the agricultural machinery industry.
In the transportation equipment industry increases in the CPI were
almost immediately reflected in higher earnings. In contrast, wage
increases in primary metals and in electrical equipment industries,
where contracts do not include escalation clauses, have shown no
acceleration. Last year's steel settlement was about in line with the

II -14
guidepost. Wage settlements in the electrical equipment industry in
1963 were among the lowest in manufacturing industries; since then
increases in hourly earnings there have been well below the average.
While some dispersion of earnings increases is to be expected
even when the terms of the guidepost are being observed, it is apparent
that, with more than half the major groups in manufacturing showing
earnings increases of 3.8 per cent or more, these terms were being
breached in manufacturing prior to the airline machinists dispute.
Up-coming contract negotiations in all likelihood will tend to continue
to confirm the pattern of high wage increases indicated in the recent
settlements in many industries.
Personal income. Personal income rose $2.5 billion in July
to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $579.7 billion, 8-1/4 per cent
above a year earlier. The July increase, though smaller than in June,
was about the same as the average in the second quarter and reflected
small gains in all major types of personal income except dividends
(unchanged) and farm proprietors' income (off slightly further).
Wagesand salaries, with manufacturing payrolls up only slightly,
rise $2.8 billion in July. Contributing to the rise was a $1.1 billion
increase in Federal Government payrolls because of higher pay rates.
The earlier shutdown of auto production this year for the model change-
over and effects of the machinists strike at some airlines and scattered
strikes in contract construction limited the rise in wages and salaries.

II -15
Personal contributions for social insurance rose by $700
million, with $600 million reflecting the initial payments of the $3
monthly contribution by the 17-1/4 million enrollees in the Medicare
voluntary medical insurance plan. Benefits paid in July under the
hospital insurance part of the Medicare program increased transfer
payments by $100 million. Federal payments for Medicare-covered
services received in July lagged as administrative procedures were being
worked out to reimburse hospitals concurrently with the provision of
the services.
Retail sales. In July, retail sales, after rebounding from
a low in May, were 2 per cent above the second quarter rate and 1 per
cent above the first quarter rate. June figures were revised to show
an increase of 3.6 per cent, rather than the preliminary 1.2 per cent,
and July was up .6 per cent further.
Growth in retail sales over the past year has been greater
for nondurable goods than for durable goods, partly as a result of
sharp increases in food prices. Much of the April-May decline and
subsequent recovery, however, was in durable goods, and may have been
in part a response to sharp deceleration in the rise in disposable income
early in the second quarter and more rapid advance since then. In
July and early August, unit sales of new domestic autos
remained at the June rate of 8.3 million units, up from 7.9 million in
May, and the value of sales of the automotive group of stores rose
somewhat further; in July it was only 2.5 per cent below the first

II -16
quarter when unit sales of new cars were at an annual rate of 9.3
million. Sales at furniture and appliance stores rose 4 per cent
in July, returning to the March peak.
At general merchandise stores, sales remained close to the
June level and were 4 per cent above the average level earlier in the
year. A shift in composition of sales at these stores toward durable
goods and away from apparel may have occurred in July in line with the
rise in furniture and appliance stores and a sharp, presumably transitory,
decline at apparel stores. Sales at food stores were very little
changed.
Consumer credit. Despite some resurgence in June and July,
consumer credit growth remains sluggish. An estimate for July (based
on incomplete reports) puts that month at about the $7.1 billion annual
rate of the first quarter. This would be higher than the second quarter
but still well below the $8.0 billion rise in instalment credit for all
of 1965. Consumer borrowing in connection with purchases of color
television sets and major appliances continued large in July; the pro-
tracted heat wave resulted in exceptionally strong demands for air
conditioners. Demands for auto credit and personal loans, on the other
hand, were apparently little changed from the June level.

II -17
Auto credit developments in recent months have varied from
the usual seasonal pattern. As the table shows, the proportion of new
cars bought on credit usually increases moderately in the second quarter,
but this year the rise was sharp. In part, this was probably due to the
earlier model changeover which, in turn, advanced the period for the
usual close-out sales. But the high inventories of new cars coupled with
the reduced sales pace of last April and May seems to have spurred
dealers to extra efforts to sell cars. In such situations, it is
the marginal buyer and user of credit who is most commonly attracted
into the market.

Repayments on consumer instalment debt have continued to rise
this spring and summer, despite the general slowdown in instalment credit
use this year. For the most part the rise reflects the fact that the
pattern of repayments is governed by the amount of credit extended in
earlier periods and by contract terms, but it is also a sign of continued

II -18
ability and willingness of consumers to pay their bills. In the second
quarter, with disposable personal income rising at the same rate as
repayments, the repayments ratio remained at the 14.5 per cent level
of the first quarter.
Orders for durable goods. The June preliminary figures for
new orders of durable goods tell about the same story as had the ad-
vance figures; the total continued to show little change at a level
moderately below the March peak. With shipments also relatively stable,
unfilled orders rose $1.4 billion or 2 per cent, which is close to the
rate of monthly increases earlier this year.
New orders for defense products rebounded to a new high for
this period of defense build-up, largely reflecting an increase in
aircraft and parts. Orders for machinery and equipment, which had
increased more than 5 per cent from March to May, declined 4 per cent
in June, with bookings down for construction machinery and electrical
transmission and distribution equipment. Orders remained at an advanced
level for consumer durable goods other than autos, while those for
autos and parts and presumably for stampings declined. For steel,
orders fell from the extraordinarily high figure for May but remained
relatively high; unfilled orders for steel increased further to a level
$1 billion or 36 per cent higher than at the end of January.
Increases in unfilled orders in June were widespread among
durable goods, aside from autos and parts. The increase in the total
nevertheless was accounted for almost entirely by defense products,
machinery and equipment, and steel.

II -19
Business inventories. Business inventories rose nearly one
per cent further in June and at the end of the month were 10 per cent
higher than a year earlier. In the second quarter as a whole the book
value of manufacturing and trade inventories rose at an annual rate of
$14.3 billion, 10 per cent more than in the first quarter and 50 per
cent more than the average for all of 1965. On a GNP basis, which
allows for price changes during the quarter, the rise was at an annual
rate of $11.8 billion.
Manufacturers' inventories increased $890 million in book
value in June, the largest rise in more than six years and a fifth
more than the average for April and May. The second quarter annual
rate of accumulation was $9.4 billion, considerably more than the $6,6
billion rate in the first quarter of the year and the $7.0 billion
rate in the final quarter of last year.
The bulk of the June increase was at durable goods industries,
where increases in stocks of producers of defense products, and machinery
and equipment and consumer goods, accounted for three-fourths of the
increase. Stocks held by producers of textile mill products and paper
and paper products also increased in June.
Relatively large increases occurred in inventories of materials
and supplies and of work-in-process in June, accelerating the uptrends
in these sectors. In the second quarter, materials and supplies increased
at an annual rate of $3.8 billion, compared with $1 billion in the first,
and work-in-process increased at an annual rate of $4.2 billion, up from
$2.9 billion in the first. In the machinery and transportation equip-
ment industries the increases in materials and supplies and in work-in-
process have been especially large relative to finished goods.

II -20
At retail stores the build-up in June was considerably less
than in May but still somewhat more than in earlier months this year.
Nearly half the May-June increase in retailers' stocks was at auto-
motive stores and reflects the build-up in auto dealers' new car stocks
which was particularly large in May.
August crop prospects. Hot, dry weather during July cut
yield prospects for most crops and reduced pasture feeds, especially
in the South Central and Atlantic Seaboard states. Over-all-pasture
conditions on August 1 were the lowest for the date since 1954.
Indications are that average crop yields will be 5 per cent below last
year's record and that crop output, also at a record level last year,
will be down nearly 7 per cent. One major factor in the output decline
is a reduction of 28 per cent in the cotton crop, reflecting an even
greater decline in acreage in this first year of the new 4-year cotton
program.
Feed grain output is likely to be 6 per cent under the
1965 record output. July weather was unfavorable for corn except in
the West and in the Northern portions of the Corn Belt and yield
prospects declined during the month. The crop is now placed at 4.0
million bushels, down 6 per cent from July 1 prospects, and 5 per cent
from last year's crop. Because of smaller yields, the soybean crop is
expected to be only 2 per cent above the 1965 crop although acreage
planted was up 7 per cent. Combined production of oil crops --

II -21
soybeans, flaxseed, peanuts, and cottonseed -- is expected to be 5 per
cent below last year.
Food grain prospects improved in July. The winter wheat
harvest, now largely completed, turned out better than expected and
rice made favorable progress. The combined food grain crop, however,
will probably be about 2 per cent under last year's relatively large
crop. Supplies of fresh vegetables, potatoes, and sweet potatoes are
likely to be below last year and, because of late spring freezes and
summer drought, deciduous fruits will also be less plentiful.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL SITUATION
Bank deposits. Growth in commercial bank time and savings
deposits accelerated to a 14 per cent annual rate in July, and inflows
continued at near this pace early in August. While one-time shifts from
nonbank depository institutions undoubtedly were contributory factors,
continuation of rapid growth after mid-July is attributable in large part
to a greater relative success of country banks in attracting time deposits
than earlier in the year.
This recent time deposit growth has been of a different pattern
than in April and early May, when increasing time deposit rates last
expanded time deposit inflows sharply. As indicated in the first table,
at weekly reporting banks there has recently been a less rapid increase
in time deposits other than CD's and a less rapid decline in passbook
savings. While the net effect of these offsetting movements was a larger
inflow of total savings and time deposits other than CD's. The July
decline in negotiable CD's kept aggregate inflows below the April pace.
New York City banks (middle panel) suffered a relatively large
attrition over the July and early August period in the sum of savings and
time deposits. On the other hand, weekly reporting banks outside New York
(bottom panel) did even better than in April, and estimates for member
banks suggest that country bank inflows of total time and savings deposits
also have accelerated over the summer. This may reflect recent increases
in rates at smaller banks, the less intense interest of small bank
customers in market securities, and less active competition from nonbank
savings institutions.

Net flows of negotiable CD's have also tended to increase
inflows at smaller banks and reduce inflows at the large, money market
banks. As indicated in the second table, weekly reporting banks
experienced only a small inflow of CD funds in the three months ending
July--after doing relatively well earlier in the year--and have had a
contraseasonal decline in outstandings in early August. Almost all of
this reduction in the six weeks of July and early August has been in
New York City, where CD's declined 153 million. Even earlier in the
year, New York banks had had only moderate increases in CD's. In
contrast, weekly reporting banks outside New York and Chicago had
sharply increased their CD's earlier in 1966, and, while their CD inflow
had decelerated, they have continued to do relatively better than banks
in New York and Chicago. The ability of these banks to continue to
attract CD's may reflect efforts of their customers to keep their own
credit lines open by taking a little lower yield on their liquid
investments than is available in the market.
The slowdown in CD sales in New York has occurred despite
rates of 5.50 generally available on 30 day maturities throughout most
of July. Since midyear, the Regulation Q ceiling has increasingly forced
concentration of sales in short CD's by money market banks, and with
September maturities already quite large, there is little question that
maturities next month will set a record.
With reserve pressures mounting, New York and other large
banks turned to a variety of sources of funds in July--including sales
of promissory notes, heavy Federal Funds purchases, additional borrowing

at the discount window, enlarging corporate RP's and borrowing from
their foreign branches. In New York City, the sum of these sources
increased more than $700 million in July, compared with $60 million
last year. Moreover, there were reports of CD sales in New York City
above 5.50 per cent to exempted foreign accounts. In the first two
weeks of August New York banks increased outstanding CD's other than
IPC by $68 million -- possibly reflecting sales to foreign official
accounts.
Repayment of loans obtained in June and shifts of private
balances to Treasury accounts due to accelerated payments of withholding
taxes reduced private demand deposits in July, following the June run-up.
Over the June and July period combined, there was little change in
either seasonally adjusted private demand balances or the money stock.
Since the end of November, the money stock has increased at a 3.5 per
cent annual rate, substantially below the 4.8 per cent rate for all of
1965.
Bank credit. Seasonally adjusted loans and investments of
banks increased by an estimated $2.8 billion in July on a last Wednesday
basis. This was an annual rate of almost 11 per cent, the highest rate
of expansion since early spring, and about as rapidly as the rate of
increase indicated on a daily average basis. Total loans registered a
seasonally adjusted growth of about $3.2 billion -- an annual rate of
increase of almost 19 per cent. To finance such loan expansion banks
(especially the larger ones) continued to liquidate Treasury issues and
to liquidate or reduce their acquisitions of other securities.

III -6
Loan demands of nonfinancial firms continued large in July,
with business loans showing a very large seasonally adjusted growth for
the second straight month -- about $1.8 billion. For the two months,
business loans increased at an annual rate of almost 31 per cent (see
Table 3), the largest rate of increase for any two consecutive months
in the 1960's. In both months, accelerated withholding tax payments --
which increased payment by $1.75 billion in June and $2.7 billion in
July -- placed special financial pressures on corporations. However,
these special needs merely buttressed a heavy underlying business
demand for bank credit and perhaps some anticipatory borrowing based
on fear that funds would not be available in the fall. The metal and
metal products industries were very heavy borrowers at city banks, as
they have been all year. Loan demand of miscellaneous manufacturing
and mining, public utilities and trade firms also showed strength in
July.
Business loans demands at weekly reporters -- especially in
New York City -- were financed mainly by the liquidation of loans to
security dealers and finance companies. As the result of both reduced
auto dealers needs and increased sales of market paper by finance
companies, finance company loans dropped off at all weekly reporters
from the very high June level. It also appears that city banks --
through higher rates for dealers, and stiffer rate and nonrate terms
for finance companies -- were shifting security dealer and nonbank finan-
cial needs to other banks and to the market in order to finance nonfinan-
cial customers.

Nonweekly reporting banks -- with their time deposit inflows
higher -- apparently showed a very strong increase in loans in July,
accounting for a much larger share of seasonally adjusted total loan
expansion than in any previous month of this year. Most of their
expansion was probably centered in business and finance company loans --
some of which may have represented loans to customers denied credit at
larger banks. Country member banks reduced their borrowings from the
Federal Reserve in June and July by almost $90 million, despite their
increased loans, while other member banks increased their discounts and
advances. In the first five months of the year, most of the increase
in member bank borrowing occurred at country banks.
The initial reports for early August indicate a considerable
retardation in growth of bank loans and investments, due mainly to a
contraseasonal decline in total loans and investments in New York City.
Weekly reporters outside of New York in the first week of August also
showed less than seasonal increases in total earning assets, although
loan demands continued strong. Nonweekly reporting banks probably will
continue to show a more rapid increase in loans in August, as their time
deposit inflows have remained large.
In assessing what is likely to be a smaller growth in busines
loans in August, it must be kept in mind that business demands for
credit are now being affected by the lower level of withholding tax
payments. Such payments in August will be less than normal by about
$1.8 billion due to previous accelerations of payments into June and
July.

III -9
Savings flows at depositary-type institutions. Using preliminary
tabulations of monthly savings flows for 200 representative associations,
the Home Loan Bank Board now estimates that share capital at all savings
and loan associations contracted $1.3 billion, or 1.2 per cent, in July.
This is roughly $300 million more attrition than was indicated by an
estimate based on savings experience for the first half of the month.
The difference reflects failure of the seasonal pattern of net inflow
to develop as expected during the latter half of the month.
While it is possible that the Bank Board sample gives a more
bearish view of over-all S & L experience than is justified, the July
attrition clearly exceeded both the $750 million net withdrawal of share
capital in April and the $490 million net withdrawal in July 1965.
In contrast with April, when California associations accounted
for more than 60 per cent of the net shrinkage in total share capital at
S & L's, net losses at the California associations in July--apparently
no more than $50 million--were less than 4 per cent of the total.
While this more favorable California experience was due partly to
seasonal influences, recent dividend rate increases and aggressive
advertising also helped to minimize net outflows at these associations.
On the other hand, losses of share capital at associations in other
Home Loan Bank districts were much larger than in April, in part
reflecting experience of the larger number of associations in those
districts that credit dividends semi-annually.

III -10
In sharp contrast with the S & L experience, mutual savings
banks in New York State showed a net savings growth of $150 million
during July. Net growth for all savings banks is estimated at $175
million or .3 per cent of outstanding deposits--nearly as large as in
July 1965. The experience of New York institutions, as for the
California S & L's, strongly reflected widespread increases in rates
paid.
Looking at institutional savings growth for the first seven
months of the year, the more favorable experience of commercial banks
becomes evident. The seasonally adjusted growth in savings deposits
at commercial banks for the first 7 months of 1966, although less than
in the record year 1965, was still larger than in 1964. Growth of
savings at mutual savings banks, on the other hand, was less than
half the record 1964 rate and at S & L's less than one-fourth the
1964 rate; for both, growth had already slowed appreciably in 1965.

Home Loan Bank advances showed a net increase of $550 million
during July, some $200 million less than in April notwithstanding the
considerably larger July attrition in savings capital. The smaller
borrowing this year is explained by the new Home Loan Bank Board policy,
enunciated in late April, requiring member associations to reduce their
own liquidity prior to securing advances. During the first seven
months of 1966, advances outstanding at the Home Loan Banks expanded
by $1.4 billion, more than in the full 12 months of any previous year.
Advances outstanding normally remain at about the end of July level
until late December when they show some further seasonal expansion.

U. S. Government securities market. Yields on U. S. Government
securities have risen sharply since late July, notably in the short- and
intermediate-term maturity areas where the impact of Treasury financings
has been concentrated. The recent advances have pushed these yields to
new cyclical highs following a short-lived rally during the third week
of July. Currently, the Treasury yield curve displays roughly the same
type of "humped" pattern as in late 1959 and early 1960, with yields
highest in the 2 to 4 year area. But the level of the present curve is
well above that of the earlier period, as may be noted in the table.

The Treasury's August refunding, which included a new 1-year
certificate and a new 4-3/4 year note, was accompanied by sizable upward
yield adjustments in the secondary market for short- and intermediate-term

III -13
Treasury obligations. While direct exchanges into the new issues by
the public were fairly large -- $1.4 billion into the certificate and
$2.7 billion into the note--- secondary market demand for these issues
proved decidedly lackluster and by payment date on August 15 the new
note had declined nearly 1/2 point below its issue price. In fact,
dealers absorbed some net selling of the new note from the public,
although dealers' over-all positions in the refunding issues were reduced
by Treasury investment account buying. On August 15, the dealers still
held $250 million of the new issues, down from $372 million on August 3,
when the subscription books were closed.
Apart from the disappointing demand for the refunding issues,
the Treasury note and bond market also reacted to rising yields and
increased calendars in the corporate and Federal Agency security markets.
Another weakening influence was contributed by widespread talk of an
increase in the prime loan rate against a background of taut money market
conditions and the approach of seasonal expansion in business loan
demands. The actual announcement of a prime loan rate increase to 6 per
cent by most major banks on August 16 and August 17 occasioned a further
sharp adjustment in bond prices and bill yields. It should be added
that retail selling of outstanding notes and bonds has been light in
recent weeks and dealer holdings of longer-term bonds have remained
small, totaling less than $1 million on August 16.
Treasury bill yields rose markedly in the first half of
August, especially on the longest maturities which were most directly
affected by the announcement of a $3.0 billion auction of March and April

III -14
tax bills. The auction is scheduled for August 1 and payment date
will be August 26. Commercial banks will bid for the bulk of the new
issues to take advantage of the 100 per cent tax and loan credit, but
their subsequent sales of the bills to acquire reserves may be larger
than usual in view of current tight bank money positions. After this
cash financing, the Treasury will be out of the market until mid- or
late October.

Yields on most other short-term debt instruments have
continued to rise in recent weeks, although secondary market rates on

shorter-term Federal Agencies declined in the latter part of July and
are still somewhat below their mid-July peaks. Generally speaking,
yields on these money market instruments are a full percentage point or
more above the pre-discount rate action level last December and at new
postwar highs.
Federal Agency securities market. Yields have continued to
move up in recent weeks on new Agency offerings in the short-intermediate
maturity area. On August 10, a $350 million FNMA issue due in about
2 years met with only a fair reception at a yield of 5.91 per cent. And
on August 16, a $590 million FHLB offering due in 1-year was also accorded
an unenthusiastic reception at a 6.00 per cent yield. The calendar ahead
includes several fairly heavy maturities which will have to be refinanced;
additionally, some FNMA participation certificates will probably be sold
in late summer or early fall.
Corporate and municipal bond markets. Following a short
period of relative stability in late July, yields on both corporate and
municipal bonds advanced sharply further in the first half of August,
in harmony with the mounting pressure in markets for other debt issues.
Among other things, a rapid build-up in the August and September
calendars of publicly offered corporate bonds and continuing bank liquida-
tion of municipal securities contributed to the further yield advances.

In the corporate market, even well-knownborrowers with prime
credit ratings were faced with the highest net interest costs since the
early Twenties. The large AT&T debenture issue -- Aaa-rated and pro-
tected against call for 5 years -- was priced to yield investors 5.58
per cent, 47 basis points above that on Telephone's similar offering in
late March, and the highest since 1923. Although this historically
generous yield led to significantly increased takings of the new
debentures by individuals and trust funds, only two-thirds of the issue
had been distributed when underwriters broke the syndicate a week later.
Subsequent trading in the free market resulted in an upward yield
adjustment of approximately 10 basis points. While several other recent
corporate bond issues were quickly distributed, these were convertible-

debentures. Most recently an Aa-rated utility bond with call
protection was reoffered to yield 5.85 per cent -- which adjusts to
5.72 per cent on an Aaa basis.
In general, market participants report a decline of
institutional interest in new corporate private placements -- due
chiefly to the relative scarcity of uncommitted investible funds at
life insurance companies. At the same time corporate financing demands
on capital markets have grown, with August offerings of corporate debt --
both private and public -- expected to be nearly 75 per cent more than
those of a year ago. Although August is typically a seasonally low
month, publicly offered corporate bond issues may aggregate as much as
$1 billion, the largest monthly volume for the year and the largest for
any August on record.

In the past three weeks, the major municipal bond yield
indexes have advanced between 10 and 21 basis points, with most of the
increase taking place last week. And the Bond Buyer's index penetrated
the 4 per cent level for the first time since 1934. The large New York
City issue was successfully distributed as large numbers of small
investors -- with purchases of as little as $5,000 or $10,000 -- as
well as trust funds were attracted to the record tax-exempt return. A
taxpayer in the 36 per cent marginal Federal tax bracket, for example,
would need a 7.1 per cent taxable return to be equivalent to the 4.55 per
cent yield available on certain of the New York City maturities and, if
this taxpayer were a resident of New York City, the tax equivalent yields
would be even higher because income on these securities is not subject to
the progressive income taxes of either the City or New York State.
Besides shunning new tax-exempt issues, commercial banks --
under conditions of tight money and strong business loan demand -- have
continued to liquidate long-term municipals. This behavior, in conjunction
with expectations of even higher yields, has supplied much of the upward
pressure on yields. The August municipal volume is now estimated at
$900 million, about 1/5 more than a year earlier, but would of course be
lower if any further postponements should materialize because of current
high borrowing costs.

reached in mid-July. The longer-run downtrend from the all-time index
high of 94.06 reached in early February now ranges to 13.2 per cent,
more than the 9.6 per cent market correction experienced in May-June
1965, but still only half as large as the major decline of 1961-62.
Recent stock price weakness has reportedly reflected more a drying up
of demand for stocks than any significant step-up in investor selling.
Trading activity since mid-July has averaged about 5,9 million
shares daily, as compared to averages of 8.2 million and 6.4 million for
the months of May and June, respectively, Investor interest and trading
in electronics stocks has increased recently.
The decline in stock prices since February has been widespread
among individual stocks and industrial groups. For example, since the
week of February 9 -- when the Standard and Poor's "500" hit its all-time

III -20
high -- the price indexes of 74 of the 82 industrial components of the
"500" have declined; 50 groups have registered declines of between 10
and 20 per cent and 10 groups declines in excess of 20 per cent. Only
8 groups -- including such earlier investor favorites as electronics
and airlines -- are above their early February levels.
Reduced demand for stocks has reflected historically high
yields now available on both bonds and liquid short-term assets, which
provide a good current hedge against stock market uncertainty. Since
early February, yields on bonds have advanced more than those on stocks
despite the downtrend in stock prices; for example, yields on new high
quality public utility bonds are up about 75 basis points since February
whereas the dividend yield on the 50 stocks in the Standard and Poor's
utility index are up only 55 basis points. To cite a specific example
of the size of the spread between the yield on the bonds of a given
utility and that on its stock, an investor interested in a stable income
could currently acquire the new bonds of Consumers Power -- at a yield
of 5.80 per cent -- or acquire its common stock at a yield of about
3.90 per cent.
Stock market credit eased $127 million during July, the
largest monthly decline since March. Most of this decline took place
in customers' net debit balances, but bank loans to other than brokers
and dealers also declined, by $28 million.
Mortgage markets. Mortgage markets continued quite tight
through July, with savings and loan associations, the dominant type of
lender, experiencing substantial losses in savings as noted elsewhere.

III -21
Recent scattered informal reports of a mild increase in investor
interest in mortgages by savings banks, where deposits rose in July,
and life insurance companies cannot yet be verified. Any substantial
pickup seems doubtful, in view of other strong competing demands for
lenders' available funds.
In July, heavy pressure on home mortgage markets was indicated
by a continued active volume of offerings of FHA and VA mortgages to FNMA
for purchase under its secondary market operations. Also yields on both
Federally-underwritten and conventional home loans increased further,
but by less than in June. Applications and requests to FHA and VA for
mortgage insurance on home loans continued to decline and were a third
below their year-earlier levels
During July, agency field reports and other sources stress
the tightness of mortgage credit for both construction and permanent home
loans. Faced with a sharp reduction in new mortgage commitments, some
would-be builders and buyers are said to be taking growing recourse to
other methods of financing, including greater use of installment land
contracts. Even so, sales of existing homes as well as new homes have
reportedly slowed down in recent months, with some existing homes formerly
for sale being taken off the market by owners unwilling to absorb large
mortgage discounts or unable to find buyers with the necessary financing.
Mortgage debt outstanding expanded much less than usual in
the second quarter, to reach a level of over $355 billion. The net
increase in outstandings was an eighth less than a year earlier, and the
smallest for the quarter in five years. As tentatively indicated in the

III -22
last FOMC report, only insurance companies recorded a year-to-year
increase in portfolio growth among the four major types of private
lenders, and insurance company takings, more than those for other
lenders, reflect take-downs of prior commitments. The sharpest reduc-
tions in year-over-year expansion were made by savings banks (down by
nearly a half) and by savings and loan associations (down by two-fifths).
Further additions to FNMA holdings, smaller than in the first quarter,
only partly offset the year-to-year reduction of one-fourth in portfolio
expansion by all other lenders combined.

U.S. balance of payments. The liquidity deficit in the
second quarter fell sharply to $163 million, seasonally adjusted,
from $554 million in the first quarter. The reduction resulted from
very large shifts of funds held in the United States by foreign
official and international institutions from liquid to nonliquid assets.
Apart from these shifts (and also from the postponement of Canadian
security issues from 1965 into 1966, less advance Canadian redemptions),
the liquidity deficit would have increased further in the second quarter
and would have averaged about $2-1/2 billion at an annual rate during
the first half of the year, as shown in the table on the next page.
Some of the shifts of foreign funds into nonliquid claims might have
occurred in response to market interest-rate incentives, but U.S.
official persuasion is believed to have been an important element in
most.
On the official reserve transactions basis, the seasonally
adjusted deficit diminished only moderately from $248 million in the
first quarter to $189 million in the second. This balance was less
affected by the changing liquidity of foreign assets since it is not
changed either by shifts in the portfolios of international institutions
or by shifts of central bank funds into long-term time deposits. It
was, however, held down in both quarters by inflows of foreign private
liquid funds totaling more than $500 million during the half-year.

Preliminary and incomplete data for July show a liquidity
deficit of $440 million before seasonal adjustment, or roughly
$3 billion at an annual rate. Net shifts of foreign official and
international institutions' liquid funds into nonliquid assets are thought
to have been small. Weekly indicators through August 10 show continuing
large deficits on the liquidity basis.
On the official reserve transactions basis, however, there
appears to have been a substantial surplus during July. The wide
divergence between this balance and the liquidity balance reflected
unusually large inflows of foreign private liquid funds, of the order
of $800 million for the month. These inflows were channeled mainly
through the foreign branches of U.S. banks, which have been bidding

IV -3
aggressively for Euro-dollar funds. Much of the July inflow probably
had its counterpart in heavy British reserve losses, as foreigners
shifted from sterling to dollars. Also, Italian banks continued to
place dollar funds in London, and other investors were probably also
attracted by the high yields there.
In the past, very large inflows of foreign private liquid
funds into the U.S. have occurred mainly during short periods of intense
pressure on sterling, notably in late 1964 and in the summer of 1965.
It seems unlikely that inflows could continue at anything like the July
pace in the absence of such pressure, although they might continue
on a significant scale. The average increase in U.S. liabilities to
foreign commercial banks (including head office liabilities to foreign
branches) was $800 million a year in 1963-65, and $1,450 million in
the peak year 1964.
The trade surplus fell sharply further in the second quarter
to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $3-1/4 billion, a seven-year
low. There were strong increases in almost all categories of imports
while exports fell off a little.
The broadly based strength in imports is shown in some detail
in the following table. Imports of industrial supplies increased
sharply after falling off a little in the first quarter. Releases from
U.S. stockpiles of $280 million in the first quarter had contributed
to the decline in imports at that time, but the second quarter increase
occurred despite further stockpile releases.

The decline in exports in the second quarter reflected lower
sales to Europe and Latin America partly offset by sharply higher
sales to Japan and shipments of wheat to India. Sales to Canada also
increased further.
The prospects of sharply higher cotton exports in the
marketing year which is just beginning, together with strong demands
for U.S. jet aircraft, may prevent further erosion of the trade surplus
later this year, but the surplus is unlikely to show significant growth
during the remainder of the year.
Those flows of U.S. private capital for which second-quarter
data are available did not show large net changes from the first quarter.
Claims on foreigners reported by U.S. banks--mainly covered by the VFCR
but including also customer items--increased moderately, by $130 million,
seasonally adjusted, in the second quarter. This renewed outflow
represented a substantial shift from reflows which averaged $270 million
a quarter during the three preceding quarters. Reflows from Japan
continued, but there were renewed outflows to Western Europe and Latin
America.
On the other hand, transactions in foreign securities shifted
almost as sharply in a favorable direction, from large outflows to a small
and exceptional net inflow, seasonally adjusted. New issues of foreign
securities in this country fell to less than $200 million, and this flow
was offset by redemptions (including advance redemptions by Canada) and
higher than usual net U.S. sales of outstanding issues.

IV -6
Financial markets abroad. Financial markets in most
industrial countries have continued to tighten in recent months.
The widespread rise of long-term and short-term interest rates,
which began about three years ago, now has carried them in many
countries not only to postwar highs, but even above the levels reached
in the late twenties. The notable exceptions are France, Italy, and
Japan, and in France rates have recently been rising again.
In most cases, the rise in interest rates has reflected the
deliberate tightening of monetary policy by the authorities in efforts
to contain inflationary pressures. Seven major countries have raised
their official discount rates since the beginning of May 1966:
Dae Country from to
May 2 Netherlands 4-1/2 5 per cent
May 27 Germany 4 5
June 2 Belgium 4-3/4 5
June 10 Sweden 5-1/2 6
July 6 Switzerland 2-1/2 3-1/2
July 14 United Kingdom 6 7
The countries continuing to pursue a restrictive monetary
policy can be divided into two main groups: those where economic
expansion continues at a fairly rapid rate (Canada, the Netherlands,
the United States, and to some extent, Germany) and those where the
rate of expansion, at least of output, has slackened considerably
(Belgium, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland). The reason
that monetary policy remains restrictive in the latter group lies
mainly in the fact that price and wage advances continue strong despite
the fact that output has stopped rising. The persistence of inflationary

IV -7
pressures reflects the chronic labor shortages experienced by most
countries since the late fifties, enhanced in some cases by labor
hoarding and reductions in the work week, and continually rising public
sector demand with little or no.restraint of private demand through
fiscal policy. Thus the burden of demand management has largely fallen
to monetary policy, and the desired restoration of relative price
stability so far has not been achieved in most countries.
In Britain, the authorities took new steps in July to restrict
domestic demand. On the monetary side, Bank rate was increased from
6 to 7 per cent, special deposit requirements of the commercial banks
were raised, and consumer credit terms were tightened, as were over-
all ceilings on bank lending.
Through the first half of the year net borrowings by the
private sector had expanded fairly rapidly despite monetary restraints.
Increases in outstanding bank advances and mortgage loans and net new
security issues of private corporations all were at a more rapid rate
than in the preceding year; only the rise in consumer credit outstanding
was more moderate. The Chancellor announced on July 12 that the
ceiling on bank advances--105 per cent of the March 1965 level--would
remain in effect beyond March 1967, and that, contrary to earlier
promises, no special arrangements would be made for commercial banks
to help business firms to meet their liabilities under the new
Selective Employment Tax, which begin to fall due on September 5.
Thus the private sector will be making a forced loan of about

IV -8
£250 million to the Government between September and December 1966,
when the Government will begin to make refunds and bonus payments
under the SET. Since banks in aggregate had reached the credit
ceiling in July, the SET payments are expected to exercise a
powerful squeeze upon the liquidity of the corporate sector in the
fall.
Mortgage funds also may be coming under further pressure.
For more than a year the spread between deposit and lending rates of
the building societies has been unusually narrow, and the societies
have had difficulties in maintaining adequate reserves. An increase
in lending rates from 6-3/4 to 7-1/8 per cent, voted last May, has
been held up pending a decision of the Prices and Incomes Board.
(In Britain, increases in lending rates affect both new and outstanding
loans.) The Bank rate increase of July 14 has aggravated the position
of the building societies, which now may have to raise deposit rates
in order not to lose funds to higher yielding investments,
In Germany, financial markets have continued to be generally
tight, but the re-emergence of balance-of-payments surpluses recently
is beginning to ease the commercial banks' liquidity positions.
Money market rates in Frankfurt rose above 6 per cent in
early June after the increase in the Bundesbank's rediscount rate.
Thereafter, seasonal demand tended to push rates up further and by
mid-July day-to-day money was quoted at 6.6 per cent, but since then
the rate has declined to 5.9 per cent on August 5. The major reasons
for this easing were the large improvement in the trade balance in

IV -9
recent months, some inflows of hot money connected with the speculation
against sterling last month, and large cash advances by the Bundesbank
to the Federal Government. As a result of the lessening strain on
their liquidity positions, banks reduced their indebtedness to the
Bundesbank from a high of DM 8,5 billion in early July to DM 6.9
billion on July 29, the lowest point in several months.
In capital markets,there appears to have been some restoration
of investor confidence as high yields have begun to attract some cautious
buying, but yields still remain near their 1966 highs. Thus 6 per cent
public authority bonds on August 5th yielded 8.34 per cent as compared
with a high of 8.60 per cent on July 15 and 8.00 per cent at the end of
May just before the discount rate was raised. But the bond market remains
generally weak and the German authorities have decided to continue
indefinitely the issue pause for public authorities which had previously
been announced for the period May-June 1966, only. Net new issues
during the first half of 1966, at DM 3.5 billion, amounted only to 41 per
cent of the volume raised a year earlier. Borrowers have been turning to
sources outside the bond market. The Federal Postal Authorities are
now raising funds from their major suppliers at a reported 8 per cent
cost; a large German city has borrowed in Switzerland against a
promissory note yielding 10.2 per cent; at the beginning of August
Farbenfabriken Bayer raised DM 50 million from domestic sources
against a promissory note yielding 9.7 per cent, a new high for a prime
borrower.

IV -10
The demoralization of the capital market has contributed to
rising criticism of the Bundesbank's restrictive policies. It is argued
that the private sector is made to pay for fiscal irresponsibility and
that the choking off of funds at a time when business is cautious about
its investment anyway may endanger future growth possibilities. In this
connection, an easing of export credit facilities by the monetary
authorities on July 22, through an increase in the rediscount facilities
of the Export Credit Corporation and a reduction in the share of
financing to be put up by the exporter, has been interpreted as an
indication of a general softening of the Bundesbank's strict policy
line.
For longer-run stabilization, the Federal Government puts its
faith in the General Economic Stabilization Bill now before Parliament.
This bill calls for coordination of Government financing plans on local,
State and Federal Government levels, possible limitation of public and
private borrowing, the establishment of a cyclical equalization reserve
to be set aside from tax funds, cyclical use of certain taxing powers,
and longer-range planning of budgetary needs.
In Canada, the continued pressure of demand upon resources
is the primary cause of tight credit conditions. This tightening is
being reflected in a slowdown in the pace of bank loan extensions. In
fact, the amount of bank loans outstanding (after seasonal adjustment)
fell fractionally in May and June, the first decline after a series of
uninterrupted month-to-month increases which had been registered
since June 1963.

IV -11
Banks find themselves in an increasing squeeze for funds,
partly because the Bank of Canada's cash management policy has seen to
it that the banks' ratio of "more liquid" assets to total assets is
remaining at slightly below the 30 per cent level considered minimal
by the banks, and partly because deposits are growing more slowly than
in the preceding year. Banks find it difficult to compete for deposits
because the 6 per cent limit set to their lending rates puts an effective
ceiling on the deposit rates they can pay. With rates in the United
States and yields on short- and long-term paper in Canada rising,
deposit flows into banks are diminishing. Although mortgage banks have
no limits set upon the rates they can pay or charge, they also find
themselves in a liquidity squeeze because the relatively low yield on
outstanding loans does not allow them to raise deposit rates to
competitive levels.
Canadian interest rates have increased significantly, though
unevenly, since the discount rate increase in March. The rate on
three month finance paper has moved from 5-3/4 per cent in March to
6 per cent at the beginning of May and to 6-1/4 per cent in early
August. The Treasury bill rate rose from 4.7 per cent in March to
5.1 per cent in April, and has since been fairly steady at 5.0-5.1 per
cent. Long-term bond yields which changed relatively little between
March and June have been rising since. On August 15 a new 26-year
bond was issued by the Government of Canada at 5.94 per cent. Even
then initial reception was not enthusiastic, as investors had
expected at least a 6 per cent coupon.

IV -12
In France, the authorities have sharply raised the yields on
new issues of public sector bonds. In early June the Finance Ministry
announced that future issues would bear a 6-1/4 per cent coupon instead
of the former 5-3/4 per cent rate. Effective yields to maturity on
two new issues in June were 6.72 and 6.79 per cent, respectively,
compared with an average yield of 6.26 per cent on the eight new
public issues floated in January-May, and market yields on outstanding
public sector bonds have risen about half as much. Rising interest
rates abroad, expanding credit demands at home, and the poor reception
given by the market in France to some new issues during the spring,
appear to be the causal factors behind the authorities' decision.
Short-term rates in July have been seasonally high and the
day-to-day rate against private paper has been at the 4-7/8 per cent
ceiling set by the Bank of France in April 1965 in order to prevent
undesirable inflows of capital from abroad. For August, expectations
are that conditions will remain tight, in part because banks will have
to cope with a 34 per cent coefficient de tresorerie in August,
substantially higher than the 31 per cent coefficient prevailing in
June and July.
In Italy, long-term yields, as reflected by the composite bond
index, remained quite stable during the first half of 1966 after the
sharp declines which had occurred during the 18 month-period ending
December, 1965. The relatively low rates available at home as compared
with those prevailing in the rest of Europe, have led firms to repay
foreign debts and refinance at home. This has been the main cause

IV -13
of the Italian deficit on private capital account which developed
during the past year. Thus there was a net outflow of private capital
from Italy of $229 million during the first six months of 1966 as
compared with a small net inflow a year earlier. Mainly for this reason the
over-all balance of payments surplus declined from $512 million in the first
half of 1965 to $278 million in January-June, 1966. Nevertheless, the
surplus still is large and is contributing to the liquidity of the
banking system. Bank loans have been rising slowly but the increase
has been accelerating lately. In May, 1966 outstanding loans were
10 per cent above the preceding year's level.
In Japan, business demands for credit have generally remained
slack in recent months and the rate of credit expansion has declined
a little. Interest rates have been stable to declining. These develop-
ments have been due in part to the moderate rate of economy recovery and
the existence of substantial excess capacity.
The average interest rate on all bank loans and advances was
7.49 per cent in June, down from the previous high of 7.99 per cent in
December of 1964. Most of the decline occurred in 1965, with the rate
dropping only slightly in recent months. Call loan rates have remained
unchanged since October, 1965, at less than 6 per cent.
The Japanese authorities are attempting to prevent rapid
repayment of foreign borrowings as a result of the lower interest rates
in Japan and higher rates abroad. In line with the steady rise in the
U.S. interest rate for acceptances, Japanese banks have steadily

IV -14
increased their rates for dollar import acceptances. Effective July 20
the Japanese authorities abolished the system of interest rate ceilings
applied to Euro-dollars borrowed by Japanese foreign exchange banks,
which had been in effect since mid-1962. The move gives the
Japanese banks more flexibility in the adjustment of the interest
rates paid for Euro-dollars.

APPENDIX A: UNEMPLOYMENT IN CONSTRUCTION*
There has been no evidence of any easing in supply of
construction workers so far this year despite the decline in hous-
ing starts and in construction expenditures. In July, unemployment
in the construction industry declined more than seasonally to the
lowest rate for the year and a level one-third below a year ago.l/
Unemployment in all industries fell only about one-fifth.
In each month this year, the unemployment rate in the construc-
tion industry has been lower than the comparable month for all
years since the Korean conflict (Table 1). According to official
Labor Department figures, unadjusted for seasonal changes, unemploy-
ment in construction was down to 4.6 per cent in July. Historically,
this is a very low and largely frictional rate and one which is
associated with intensive pressure on skilled construction workers.
Many of the unemployed are transitory workers.
Characteristically, annual average unemployment in construc-
tion has been about twice as high as the total unemployment rate
(Table 2). This is true in periods of expansion and periods of
recession. Often the higher unemployment rate in the construction
industry is quoted as evidence of large available supplies of
construction workers and substantially weaker demand in construc-
tion than for the economy as a whole. Such comparisons do not
represent a fair evaluation of current labor supply-demand conditions
in the industry because the higher unemployment rate in construction
reflects primarily the seasonal nature of the industry and the
large amount of frictional unemployment created by the continual
ending of jobs on separate construction projects.
I/ The seasonally adjusted unemployment rates are unofficial Federal
Reserve calculations. The unadjusted figures are from the official
Labor Department unemployment series which is based on a national
survey of households. All wage and salary workers in the construc-
tion industry are covered, including those engaged in repair and
maintenance. Workers are considered to be unemployed in construction
if their last job was in that industry. There is no Government un-
employment survey which differentiates unemployed workers last
employed in residential or nonresidential construction activity.
Unofficial estimates of unemployment in construction are sometimes
made for cities by the Bureau of Employment Security, but such esti-
mates are not necessarily consistent from area to area or with the
national series.

The high ratio of unemployment in the construction industry to
the average has held even in periods of very tight labor market conditions
when there were intensive wage pressures and substantial shortages of
construction labor. Although the ratio dropped slightly below the usual
2:1 during the Korean conflict, the average annual unemployment rate in
construction never fell below 5.5 per cent. The ratio of construction
unemployment to total unemployment is now as low as in 1951 and 1952, and
represents a relatively greater decline in construction unemployment since
1963 than for total unemployment.
The seasonal swings in unemployment in construction are extremely
large. In the relatively good year of 1963, unemployment was at a high
22.2 per cent in February and a low of 6.6 per cent in August, a decline
of more than two-thirds. For total unemployment the seasonal decline was
from 6.9 to 5.2 for the same months. As economic expansion progressed,
unemployment has declined both at the seasonal highs and lows. In 1966,
the unadjusted unemployment rate in construction in February was
11.4 per cent and 4.6 per cent in June.
Two major conclusions can be drawn. First, if the annual
unemployment rate in construction is to be brought down to the average
for total unemployment, there will have to be a major reduction in winter

A- 4
unemployment and a change in the employment pattern from relatively short
jobs on different projects to steady year-round jobs. Since such basic
changes are not likely in the near future, the annual average unemployment
rate in the construction industry can be expected to continue to be close
to twice as high as total unemployment.
Second, the relatively constant ratios between construction
and total unemployment,apart from seasonal shifts, strongly indicate that
unemployment in construction is largely influenced by changes in total
demands. Even when construction expenditures (residential or nonresi-
dential) show somewhat different patterns of change than overall ex-
penditures, the unemployment ratio apparently is not greatly affected. For
example, in 1955 and 1956 sharp reductions in residential activity occurred
in a period of strong overall demands and both total unemployment and un-
employment in construction dropped significantly. This would seem to
imply that when total unemployment is low, laid-off construction workers
move relatively easily into other jobs either within or outside the con-
struction industry and hoarding of skilled tradesmen increases.
Past experience suggests, therefore, that if residential
activity is reduced further this year the laid-off workers are likely
to find other jobs if overall demand continues to expand and total
unemployment remains at about current levels. With declining con-
struction activity, however, some cities or geographical areas could
experience relatively sharp declines in construction employment.
Fortunately, mobility of construction workers is very high and a large
number of dropped workers would probably be able to take jobs in other
industries or move to other areas with stronger construction activity.

APPENDIX B;
REVIEW OF FLOW OF FUNDS IN SECOND QUARTER*
Summary. Accelerated Federal tax collections in the second
quarter had a major influence on both total borrowing and the forms of
funds advanced in credit markets during the quarter. Primarily because
of extra tax receipts from April and June prepayments on 1966 corporate
profit tax liabilities, the Federal cash surplus was markedly higher
than in the first quarter. This rise was reflected in both reduced
Government borrowing and in a sharp rise in Treasury cash balances.
The shift of funds from the private economy to the Government
resulted in abnormally low private flows into financial claims, with all
forms of private financial investment down from the first quarter except
inflows into commercial bank time deposits. Supported by time deposits
growth and increases in Treasury cash balances, banks supplied 41 per cent
of total funds borrowed during the second quarter, twice the first-quarter
proportion and higher than 1965 as a whole. After netting out the build-
up in Treasury deposits, however, bank credit supplied about 26 per cent
of funds raised during the first six months of 1966 taken together, well
below the 40 per cent average for 1965.
Federal finance. Table 1 shows at annual rates the large
shifts in Federal fiscal and financial position from the first to the
second quarter that affect the subsequent financial-market summary
tables. On a national-income basis, the Federal surplus shows little
change from the first to the second quarter, primarily because corporate
profit taxes in the national-income accounts are credited to the
Governments as they accrue rather than as they are paid.l/ Converting the
national-income surplus to a cash basis for corporate taxes, as on line 3,
suggests the size of impact that the April and June prepayments had on
the Federal fiscal position. Further adjustments on lines 4 and 5 toward
a cash-budget concept bring the total increase in surplus (at annual
rates) to over $27 billion in the second quarter.
* Prepared by Stephen P. Taylor, Chief, Flow-of-Funds and
Savings Section, Division of Research and Statistics.
1/Higher withholding rates on individual taxes are included in
the national-income surplus in both the first and second quarters, while
accelerated transfers of withheld taxes by large employers are reflected
in line 5 of Table 1.

B- 2
In its financial operations, the Government met this rise in
surplus by cutting back borrowing sharply from the high rate of the
first quarter and by building up cash balances far more than seasonally.
As can be seen in subsequent tables, the rise in Treasury deposits at
commercial banks was a major incremental source of bank credit during
the quarter.
As shown in Table 2, the $3.8 billion rate of Federal borrow-
ing during the quarter was the difference between a $13.5 billion rate
of retirements on direct debt (mainly bills) and a $17.3 billion annual
rate of issues in nonguaranteed forms and loan participation certificates.
Of the $17.3 billion increase in indirect debt, $8.6 billion constituted
borrowing through home loan bank, FNMA, and land bank bonds, and $7.2
billion represented sales of loan participations of all types--FNMA,
SBA, CCC, and Export-Import Bank. The $17.3 billion growth in indirect
debt was well above the $9 billion rate of lending by the Government and
thus supplies funds, at least indirectly, for Federal purposes other
than loan programs.
Private borrowing in credit markets. Private borrowing was
little higher in the second quarter than in the first, and as Table 3
indicates, the ratio of private funds raised to private net investment
expenditures declined in the first half of 1966 and was well below the
1961-65 average. About $10 billion of net funds other than depreciation
allowances and credit have been used to finance investment outlays this
year. Earlier in this expansion, such internal financing, from net
saving and drawdowns of financial asset holdings, had been negligible
before the second half of 1965.
Although the total of private borrowing was little changed
from the first quarter, there were large shifts in the forms of credit
raised. Virtually all of the rise from first quarter rates of borrowing
was in business bank loans, while there were declines in mortgage borrow-
ing from $26 billion to $23 billion, in security issues from $12 billion
to $8 billion, and in consumer credit from $9.2 billion to $7 billion,
all at seasonally adjusted annual rates. The high rate of business
borrowing from banks in the second quarter, however, no more than offset
the low first-quarter flow of bank loans, and for the half year as a
whole, bank loan growth was not significantly different from the 1965
rate. The increment in private credit this year has thus been supplied
in other forms, mainly corporate bond issues.

2/ Bank loans n.e.c. shown here are similar to business loans
in other banking statistics, differing mainly in seasonal adjustment
procedures used. For business loans in L.4.3 banking statistics, the
annual rates of growth for the periods shown above were 18.1 per cent
in 1st half 1965, 14.1 per cent in 2nd half 1965, and 20.5 per cent in
first half 1966.
Financial investment by the public. The second-quarter shift
of funds from the public to the Federal Government reduced sharply the
total flow into financial markets from private investors, as shown in
Table 4. Although time deposit inflows to commercial banks held up well,
investment in cash balances, savings accounts at nonbank institutbns,
Government securities, and private instruments were all sharply down
from the first quarter. Apart from changes in cash holdings, which are
characteristically volatile in the short run, the largest relative drop
was in flows to nonbank savings institutions, which were more than 60
per cent below the first-quarter rate. This decline was not fully off-
set in bank time deposits, and the total of bank and nonbank time and
savings accounts increased somewhat less than in the first quarter and
at about two-thirds the 1965 rate.
The drop in private investment in securities was mainly in
direct Federal debt, reflecting the sizable reduction in Federal borrow-
ing during the quarter. Total direct investment in securities was still
high by any standard other than the first quarter, however, and of the
$l6 billion rate indicated, well over $10 billion appears to have been
in U.S. Government agency issues.
Within the constraint of reduced funds available for lending,
private investors thus shifted from cash to interest-bearing invest-
ments, from claims in nonbank institutions to bank time deposits, and
from deposit claims as a whole to market securities, mainly nonguaranteed
Federal debt issues.

B-4
Bank credit in relation to total credit. Inflows of time
deposits and the exceptional rise in Treasury cash balances made banks
a major direct source of credit to borrowers during the second quarter,
supplying 41 per cent of funds raised. The transitory increase in
Treasury deposits was the main source of this rise, however. Bank
credit from other sources constituted 26 per cent of total credit flows
during both quarters of 1966, as indicated in Table 5. This was well
below the 40 per cent in 1965 as a whole and the 35 per cent average for
1961-65 and reflects primarily the heavy volume of direct security pur-
chases by the nonfinancial public and the relatively high volume of
Federal lending this year.
