SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK
Outlook for GNP
Gains in GNP in this and the next quarter are still likely
to be appreciably larger than in the second quarter with a deepening
of the decline in residential construction but with an acceleration of
the increase in defense outlays. We are now projecting GNP expansion
at about $14 billion in the third quarter and $15 billion in the fourth
quarter, as compared with $11 billion in the second quarter and $17
billion in the first.
The level of business plant and equipment outlays projected
earlier for the third and fourth quarters has been confirmed by the
latest Commerce-SEC survey, and the second quarter was raised moder-
ately. An increase of 17 per cent is still in prospect for the year
1966. Order and output trends remained strong in the machinery and
equipment industries through July.
A rapid run-down in the Federal cash balance and upward
revision of recent defense orders suggest that defense spending is
rising faster in the third and fourth quarters than was projected
earlier--at a $3.5 billion rate rather than a $2.5 billion rate.
Also, with new evidence showing a further step-up in the rate of
stock building by manufacturers in July, our earlier projection of
business inventory accumulation has been raised to show somewhat less
decline from the exceptionally high second quarter rate.

I- 2
The third quarter rise projected in consumer spending on
goods and services--about double the small second quarter increase--
is about in line with the rise projected for disposable income.
Increases are expected to be higher because of the rise in Federal
salaries, Medicare and other transfer payments, and a smaller increase
in the personal tax take. Sales of new domestic autos rose appreciably
in late August, and for the month were apparently at an 8.5 million
annual rate--our projected rate for the current and next quarter. The
recovery in auto sales following the decline in the spring accounts
for much of the sharp pick-up in the rate of increase in consumption
expenditures from the second to the third quarter.
Resource-use and prices
With the rise in economic activity now in prospect,
pressures on resources are likely to be maintained. Expansion in
industrial activity since midyear--even with auto production down--
has equaled or exceeded the estimated growth in capacity. Use of
manufacturing capacity has remained above 92 per cent, and unemploy-
ment has remained at about 4 per cent of the civilian labor force.
That rates of resource use will be at least maintained in coming
months is suggested by prospects for recovery in auto production and
for further expansion in output, not only of business and defense
equipment but also of materials for current use and for inventory.
Only in the residential construction area is there clear evidence of
declining activity.

I-3
Price developments in the months ahead, as has been stressed
before, will be strongly influenced by the response of participants in
labor contract negotiations to the developing business and financial
situation. The very low level of unemployment for prime labor force
groups, increases in consumer prices and wage escalation in some
industries, large profits in most industries, and the waving influence
of the guideposts for wages and prices have already led to increasing
labor demands. Moreover, after many years of stress on fringe benefits,
the emphasis has been shifting back toward money wage increases and
escalator clauses, which tend to have a more certain and often more
prompt effect on unit labor costs. In the first half of this year,
however, the increase in labor costs per unit of output in manufacturing
was small, and was caused mainly by the January increase in social
security taxes.
While price prospects continue to be dominated by the wage
and labor cost response to strong demands, prices of sensitive
materials, which contributed so much to the earlier rise, have declined
somewhat in recent months. A general easing in supplies for the major
nonferrous metals, including copper, has brought sharp price declines
in the more volatile markets. Consequently, the rise in the index for
all industrial commodity prices since midyear has been considerably
less rapid than the 3.5 per cent annual rate of the first half.
Whether the supply situation for sensitive materials will remain easier,
or whether it will tighten again and renew upward pressures on the

S- 4
price structure will depend primarily on two factors: the military
effort in Vietnam and the seriousness of any strikes or other inter-
ruptions to production,
For other industrial materials and finished products prices
have continued to rise in recent months although the pace has been
slower than in the first half of the year. Expansion and activity at
the projected rate will sustain the rise, and the rate of increase will
be strongly influenced by what happens to wages and labor costs per
unit of output.
Bank credit outlook
Growth in bank loans is likely to be much larger in September
than in August, but probably will fall appreciably short of the unu-
sually high levels of June and July. Some of the temporary factors
which tended to dampen loan demands in August will no longer be
operative or will be of reduced importance: (1) corporation payments
on withheld income and social security will be about normal in September
again after having been at a much reduced level in August as a result
of the recent acceleration program; (2) large corporate income tax
payments are due in September; and (3) finance companies will need to
borrow heavily again to redeem commercial paper over the tax period
after having made unusually heavy bank loan repayments in July and
August.
In addition to these temporary influences, corporate cash
flows are continuing to fall short of expenditures, and corporate needs

I-5
for outside financing will be continuing large. The extent of actual
rise in bank loans, however, might well be moderate compared with
earlier this summer by two possible developments--a reduction in the
rate of business inventory accumulation from recent high levels and a
further tightening of lending policies at the banks, particularly in
the light of the Board's discount policy statement of September 1.
Bank efforts to accomodate expected loan demand will be
complicated by a record level of CD's maturing in September, an amount
in excess of $5.2 billion. In New York City alone, $2.2 billion of
CD's will mature in September--31 per cent of their total outstandings.
Current rate relationships suggest that banks, in the aggregate will
be unable to roll-over all of these certificates. Banks in major
money market centers particularly are likely to face CD attrition as
holders of maturing certificates shift to other short-term assets or
use the proceeds for tax and transaction purposes; for the banking
system as a whole net CD run-offs could amount to $1.5 billion or
more. The banks likely to be most adversely affected by CD attrition
are also the institutions that will be most affected by this month's
increased reserve requirements on time deposits in excess of $5 million
and the September 1 reclassification of promissory notes as deposits.
In anticipation of the resultant reserve pressures, large
banks appear to have increased their holdings of short-term liquid
assets in August; for example, New York banks became Federal funds
sellers late last month. This preparatory accumulation of liquid
assets, however, will not eliminate the necessity for banks to make

I-6
other adjustments--in both assets and liabilities--in meeting September
loan demands.
Securities markets prospects
The abrupt recent turn-around of yields in the bond market
is attributable chiefly to some abatement in fears of an approaching
credit availability crisis, fears which were being accorded increasing
credence during the latter half of August. Short-term rates, by way
of contrast, have contined to advance as bank reserve positions have
remained under pressure and the money market has had to digest a
$3.0 billion addition to the supply of Treasury bills. The advent of
fall seasonal loan demands, combined with continuing reserve pressures
and the prospect of unusually large shifts in deposit funds, can be
expected to maintain upward pressure on shorter-term rates.
In long-term markets, easing in investor concern developed
following reports of increased prospects for near-term fiscal action.
With the possibility thus raised of some shift in the monetary-fiscal
policy mix, the extreme yield mark-ups of late August were quickly
reversed. Also, reports that the contemplated September sale of FNMA
participation certificates would be postponed or reduced in size, and
the Federal Reserve statement on use of the discount window suggesting
that banks would be under less pressure to liquidate securities,
reinforced the downward tendency in yields. At the same time security
dealers scrambled to cover short positions and, in the case of municipal
securities, to replenish depleted bond inventories.

I- 7
At this juncture, the likely extent and duration of the
yield down-swing are uncertain. As the current down-turn in rates is
extended, it increasingly reflects expectations about future events
which still have to be confirmed. In particular, the course which the
Administration actually takes on fiscal policy, and the extent to which
either new fiscal actions--or monetary actions already taken--will
moderate business spending and financing plans are the major determi-
nants of whether recent yield declines are sustained and extended, or
simply prove to be temporary as was the case last spring. In the
absence of a significant cut-back in spending plans, business needs
for financing will remain heavy and, with bank credit further con-
strained, should continue to weigh more heavily on capital markets.
In the municipal bond market, the steep run-up of bond
yields during late August was attributable more to actual and expected
bank selling in the secondary market than to the calendar of new
offerings, which has recently been running below a year ago. To some
extent, however, the reduced calendar has reflected both voluntary and in-
voluntary withdrawals of planned offerings--the latter due to statutory rate
limitations. Hence, any sizable decline of yields would be likely to
encourage some enlargement of the new issue calendar.
Balance of payments
A continuing large inflow of foreign liquid funds kept the
U. S. payments position in surplus on the official settlements basis,
seasonally adjusted, in August, and may have averted some pressures

I-8
that ight otherwise have developed on the U. S. gold stock and on
Federal Reserve swap lines. But balance-of-payments relief from this
source on the August scale should probably be viewed as temporary.
The underlying payments position continues to be one of substantial
deficit. On the liquidity basis of calculation, there was a deficit
in July-August on the order of $3 billion at an annual rate.
The inflow of foreign liquid funds came through the foreign
branches of U. S. banks, which continued to bid aggressively for
Euro-dollars in August. The liabilities of U. S. head offices to
their foreign branches increased further by about $350 million during
the month, after an increase of about $750 million in July. As the
run on sterling abated, the supply of Euro-dollars from that source
apparently diminshed sharply, while transfers (presumably covered
forward) out of Continental European currencies into Euro-dollars
apparently increased. The latter development is suggested by market
reports and by the behavior of exchange rates and official reserves.
The merchandise trade balance continued to deteriorate in
July. From the first quarter to June-July--a fairly representative
period--imports shot up at an annual rate of more than 20 per cent;
i.e. about three times as fast as GNP, while exports advanced at an
8 per cent rate. There are reasons to expect some acceleration of the
export advance and some slowing of the import expansion in the months
ahead. These developments, together with minor net changes on other
current transactions, may halt the shrinkage of the current account
surplus, but seem unlikely to reverse it.

I-9
New favorable developments on capital account also seem
unlikely. In particular, reflows of U. S. bank credit are already
large, and the outflow of U. S. direct investment capital, net of
amounts borrowed abroad, had already declined in the first half year
to about the $2-1/2 billion annual rate expected for the full year.
Thus the outlook for the remainder of the year is for
continuation of the liquidity deficit at roughly the recent $3 billion
rate, and for reemergence of a deficit on the official settlements
basis as inflows of foreign private liquid funds diminish.

THE ECONOMIC PICTURE IN DETAIL
The Nonfinancial Scene
Gross National Product. Gross national product is projected
to rise about $14 billion in the third quarter and $15 billion in the
fourth quarter -- to reach a year-end level of over $760 billion. Prices
are expected to continue to increase about as fast as in the first half
of the year; the rise in GNP in real terms in the second half would
then be at an annual rate of 4 per cent, the same as in the first half of
the year.
The over-all increase indicated for the last half of the
year is little changed from that projected three weeks ago. In light
of the sharp drop in housing starts through July and of the continuing
stringency in mortgage markets, projected levels of residential con-
struction activity have been lowered appreciably in both the third and
fourth quarters to show a much larger decline than indicated earlier.
On the other hand, defense spending has been raised to show increases
of $3.5 billion a quarter, instead of the $2.5 billion projected
earlier. This boost in defense spending is suggested by recent evidence
of a much more rapid rundown in the Federal cash balance in recent
months than had been anticipated, by some upward revisions in the
recent level of defense orders, and by the large increase in draft
calls for October.
The rate of nonfarm business inventory accumulation is still
expected to decline in the last half of the year from the exceptionally

II -2
high second quarter level -- but by not quite so much as was projected
earlier. July book value figures indicated a sustained high rate of
accumulation of goods other than autos, particularly in manufacturing,
and preliminary August indications for production and final takings
show a continued high rate of inventory accumulation. Auto inventories,
which increased substantially in the second quarter, are projected to
show little change overthe current quarter and then to decline somewhat
in the fourth quarter.
Farm inventory accumulation has also been revised upward for
the current and next quarters -- by small amounts which have been
deducted from "other Federal purchases of goods and services."
According to information now available, farmers are accumulating inven-
tories rather than putting crops under Federal loan, because of the
favorable market price situation.
Large further increases in business fixed investment are
still being projected for the last half of this year. The latest
Commerce-SEC survey of nonfarm outlays for new plant and equipment
(conducted in late July and August) confirmed the third and fourth
quarter levels that business had planned three months ago (and which
have been incorporated in the GNP projections for the last half of this
year) the latest survey also showed a moderate ($.5 billion) upward
revision in outlays for the second quarter (not now incorporated
in the second quarter GNP estimate) The increase in dollar outlays for
the year as a whole remains 17 per cent. It might be significant that

II -3
business has this time not revised upward its earlier projections;
upward revision of initial estimates -- from lower rates -- was
virtually the rule from early 1964 to mid-1966. According to a recent
NICB survey a moderate decline in new capital appropriations is now
expected by manufacturers in the last half of the year; however, the
backlog of unspent appropriations also is expected to rise.
Third and fourth quarter consumer income, spending, and savings
patterns remain about as projected earlier. The third quarter rise in
disposable income is expected to be double the small second quarter
increase, largely as a result of a spurt in Federal transfer payments
and the Federal pay increases and because of a smaller rise in personal
tax payments. In the fourth quarter disposable income is expected to
rise as much as in the third quarter. Private wages are expected to
increase somewhat faster, and there will be some further increase in
transfer payments. Moreover, the increased taxes for the supplementary
Medicare insurance plan, which limited somewhat the rise in personal
income in the third quarter, will not affect the fourth quarter rise;
and the increase in other personal tax payments is expected to moderate
further.
Consumption expenditures are projected as rising about
$9.5 billion in the third and also the fourth quarters. As in the case
of income these gains are about double the small second quarter increase.
The reversal from sharp decline to moderate recovery in new auto sales
accounts for much of the speed-up in consumer spending in the third
quarter. In the fourth quarter sales of new domestic autos are projected

II -4
as holding at the 8.5 million annual rate estimated for the third quarter,
but auto prices are expected to be up, leading to a further rise in the
dollar volume of auto sales. In line with recent retail sales
developments, the rise projected for nondurable goods is about the
same as the second quarter increase. Partly under the expected
stimulus of the Medicare program to the volume of medical treatment
and partly due to an apparent step-up in price increases, some
acceleration in gains in service expenditures is being projected in
the last half of the year.

Industrial production. Industrial production in August is
estimated to have increased about 1 percentage point further from the
preliminary July figure of 157.5 per cent of the 1957-59 average.
Gains in output were widespread among both final products and materials.
Auto assemblies in August failed to meet earlier production
schedules and, after allowance for the model changeover, were 9 per
cent below the reduced July level. Schedules for September indicate a
rise in output of about 15 per cent; the level would still be 10 per
cent below production at the beginning of the model run a year ago.
Production of television sets and furniture, which had declined in
July, increased in August, apparently in response to the recovery in
retail sales of these goods in July and August.
Continued rapid expansion in output of both business and
defense equipment in August is suggested by increases in production
worker manhours in the machinery, aircraft, and ordnance industries and
by a further rise of unfilled orders in July.
Output of iron and steel, which declined considerably less
than seasonally in July, continued strong in August. Paperboard, crude
oil, and refined petroleum products were at advanced production levels
and August employment data suggest further increases in output of chemical
products.
Auto sales and inventories. Sales of new domestic autos in
the month of August were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 8.5
million, 2 per cent above the two preceding months, but 4 per cent below

II -7
a year ago. Inventories of new cars on August 31, estimated to be 1.1
million, were down sharply from the extraordinary peak of 1.7 million
at the end of June. Stocks are expected to increase rather sharply
in the month of September as a consequence of the accelerated September
production schedule. Assuming a seasonally adjusted sales rate of 8.5
million in September, ending inventories on September 30 will likely be
about 1.3 million units, an unusually high level for the beginning
of a model year.
Consumer credit. Consumers added $564 million to their instal-
ment debt in July. The rate of increase in instalment credit in July
was up from June and the second quarter but still below the first quarter
rate. And, moreover, the pace thus far in 1966 remains well behind that
for 1965.
In July a larger share than usual was accounted for by credit
purchases of furniture and other home goods. Through the first six
months of the year, such credit contributed one-third of the increase
in total instalment credit, but in July it accounted for almost 45 per
cent. Retail sales of furniture and appliances, and especially color
television sets and air conditioners, were strong in July, giving rise
to somewhat larger than usual demands for credit.
Repayments on instalment debt have continued to rise, but the
increase in the second quarter was the smallest in a year and a half.
Meanwhile, credit extensions, which leveled off late last year, turned
down a little in the second quarter. The tempo of both extensions and
repayments then picked up in July, as the table shows.

Interest charges on consumer loans continue to rise. In
some areas, bank lending rates are bumping against statutory limits as,
for example, in Chicago where the legal maximum under usury laws is
7 per cent, in Philadelphia where it is 6 per cent, and in Los Angeles
where it is 8 per cent. The rates that have reached these limits are,
for the most part, those charged on used car and unsecured personal
loans. New car loans continue to carry a preferential rate at many
banks.
In general, sales finance company rates have risen about as
much as bank rates. Most consumer finance companies, on the other hand,
have not raised their charges at all, since they already operate at the
maximums provided by State small loan laws. Credit unions, too, have
changed their rates little. Perhaps the stickiest rates have been those
charged by consumer lenders in smaller cities and towns. These seem to
have changed little, even where not affected by statutory limitations.

II -9
Consumer buying plans. According to the Census mid-July
survey, consumer intentions to buy new autos within 12 months were
about as numerous as they were in mid-1965, with 9.4 per cent of
households expressing such intentions as compared with 9.6 per cent a
year earlier. Leveling off over the past year contrasts with a
sequence of large increases from 1962 to 1965. Twelve-month buying
plans for used cars were up slightly from a year ago; 7.9 per cent as
compared with 7.6 per cent in July 1965.
Plans to buy household durable goods, on the other hand,
were considerably stronger than a year ago: in the recent survey 18.7
per cent of all households expressed intentions to buy at least one
of 7 major items within 6 months as compared with 17.2 per cent a
year earlier. Similar large year-over-year gains were recorded in
the preceding two quarterly surveys.
In July as in the earlier surveys this year, sizable year-
over-year gains were reported in the proportion of households whose
current income exceeded year-earlier levels and in the proportion of
households expecting higher income a year hence.
Manufacturers' inventories. The pace of inventory accumu-
lation stepped up further at manufacturers in July, when the book
value increase totaled nearly $1 billion. Accumulation was about $850
million in June and, for the second quarter as a whole, averaged
$767 million. From mid-1965 to last March, the book value of factory
stocks was increasing at a rate of about $550 million per month.

II -10
MONTHLY AVERAGE CHANGE IN MANUFACTURERS' INVENTORIES

Other durables 76 148 90 169 196
Nondurable goods 24 170 228 190 182
The pronounced pick-up in the rate of accumulation in recent
months has been concentrated in durable goods industries. Accumu-
lation by nondurable goods producers has fluctuated rather narrowly
around a monthly average close to $200 million since mid-1965.
The July book value increase for durable goods of $799
million was over a third above the high second quarter, with increases
widespread. Half the rise was in the business and defense equipment
industries where inventory increases continued to accelerate owing
mainly to a further spurt in work-in-process stocks; order and output
gains remain strong in these industries. A large rise was reported for
inventories in the auto industry (about $170 million) which may have
been an aberration due to problems of seasonal measurement during the
model changeover.
Factory inventories of materials and supplies, which had
spurted in the second quarter, showed a much smaller rise in July,
although accumulation of such stocks continued at a fairly rapid pace
in the business and defense equipment industries.

II -11
The rise in factory stocks in recent months has exceeded the
rise in shipments and the manufacturing inventory-shipments ratio,
which was at a low for this expansion period in the first quarter, has
increased moderately. For durable goods, this July inventory-shipments
ratio was the highest since the beginning of 1963, except for October
1964 which was affected by auto strikes. The inventory-shipments
ratio for nondurable goods remains unusually low -- 12 per cent below
early 1963.
Retail inventories. The book value of retail inventories
declined slightly in July, as stocks held by auto dealers showed a
sizable decrease and other trade inventories increased only moderately.
The drop in auto stocks was associated with an unusually sharp cutback
in production due to the early model changeover, while sales showed
only the usual seasonal decline. A reversal of the July decline in
auto stocks may come in September, when the early model changeover is
bringing an unusually sharp run-up in output for that month.
Thus, July developments are not considered representative
of the probable change in retail trade inventories during the third
quarter.
Residential building. The sharpness of the drop -- one-third --
in housing starts from March through July has exceeded initial expec-
tations and has raised further questions about the extent of further
cutbacks that may occur in the period immediately ahead. A significant
decline in housing starts during the course of the year was anticipated,

II -12
but at 1.06 million (including farm starts) the seasonally adjusted
annual rate in July is one of the lowest since World War II. While
the series is inherently volatile and subject to marked revision, it
has rarely, as in this instance, declined as many as four consecutive
months in a row. Moreover, the three-month moving average at 1.22
million for the May-July period was below the 1.25 million average in
1960, a recession year for housing starts.
Owing to difficulties in seasonal adjustment, some upward
fluctuation in the series may occur in individual months immediately
ahead. The Census Bureau, for example, does not allow fully for
variations in the number of working days in deriving the seasonally
adjusted starts series. Consequently, the possibility that a temporary
rise in the rate may be reported for August cannot be ruled out mainly
because August this year had an unusually high number of working days
relative to July. Unlike the situation in the early part of the year,
mortgage commitments to builders are now at a low ebb and funds available
for mortgage loans from all of the major types of institutional lenders
are severely restricted.
While most of the decline in starts of both single and multi-
family units may have already been experienced, a really significant
upturn cannot occur until basic inflow positions of private lenders are
improved and pressures lessen from other types of demands for credit.
Pending such a development, it seems most likely that starts over the
remainder of 1966 will average at most 1.1 million units and bring the
total for 1966 under that for 1960.

II -13
The stimulative impact of the new legislation (still to be
signed by the President) granting the Federal National Mortgage Associ-
ation an additional $4.8 billion of purchasing authority, as is
explained more fully in the appendix, the magnitude of the direct
contribution to starts from this source may be moderate. Altogether
the direct contribution may amount to no more than 130,000 new housing
units spread over a period of at least 12-18 months.
Of the two programs affected by the legislation (FNMA's
secondary market operations and its special assistance functions),
the $1 billion special assistance portion potentially offers the speedier
and more direct avenue of assistance to builders. In April 1958,
FNMA received similar authority under conditions when mortgage discounts
were lower than they have been recently and the market for mortgages
was generally beginning to ease. Nevertheless, it is estimated that
although there was some immediate impact in the month the legislation
became effective, there was a lag of some 7 months before starts
financed by the special assistance program reached their maximum
volume. This suggests that the major impact of the new program will
probably not be experienced until some time next year.
Labor market. The labor market showed continued strength
in August. Employment gains in manufacturing were impressive -- especially
in the metals and machinery industries -- but employment weakness
was evident in construction, and trade failed to show its recent strength.
Hours of work in manufacturing increased in August following 2 months

II -14
of decline, in part due to the early start of the auto model year. The
over-all unemployment rate, at 3.9 per cent in August, continued
virtually unchanged for the fourth consecutive month.
Nonfarm employment. Nonfarm payroll employment continued to
move up quite vigorously in August but gains were somewhat more
selective. Employment rose by 210,000 to 64.3 million (revised) and
was 3.3 million, or 5 per cent, above a year ago. Manufacturing and
government accounted for 2 million of the gain.
In manufacturing industries, employment in August continued
to increase at the fast pace set so far in 1966, as shown in the table.
Gains, however, were increasingly concentrated in the defense and capital
goods oriented industries. Especially large increases were recorded
in primary metals and electrical machinery. A sharp rise in transportation
equipment from July to August is due in large measure to the earlier
than usual model changeover in autos this year.

II -15
In government (Federal and State and local), as in manufacturing,
the rise in employment continued at the rapid rate of 85,000 monthly
or 1.0 million annually. On the other hand, in the private nonmanu-
facturing sector, construction employment declined and trade failed to
show its recent increase. Since the March peak, the decline in con-
struction employment has amounted to 170,000 or 5 per cent.
Hours and earnings in manufacturing. The workweek rose 0.2
hours from July to 41.3 hours in August, slightly below the February
peak of 41.5 hours. Some of the decline in July and the rise in
August resulted from the early seasonal shutdown of auto plants. The
workweek rose strongly -- by 0.5 hours -- in primary metals. In
nondurable goods industries, the workweek has gradually declined from
a high of 40.5 hours in February this year to 40.1 hours in July and
August.
Average hourly earnings in manufacturing, at $2.69 in August
were 10 cents, or 3.9 per cent higher than a year earlier, reflecting
in part more overtime work. The rate of increase in earnings has
accelerated somewhat; in the first quarter, hourly earnings were showing
a 3.4 per cent rise, and between 1964 and 1965 the increase was 3.2
per cent.
Unemployment. The lack of improvement in the over-all unemploy-
ment rate -- close to 4 per cent since last January -- reflects some
worsening of the unemployment situation for Negroes and less skilled

II -16
workers in recent months. The unemployment rate for nonwhite workers
rose to 8.2 per cent in August, over a percentage point higher than in
January. By comparison, the unemployment rate has continued at near
frictional levels for married men, white collar workers and skilled
blue collar workers. Although the economy appears temporarily to have
reached a floor for over-all unemployment at close to 4 per cent, some
improvement may be apparent in the fall with the return to school of
teenagers and with recovery of auto production.
Between the summers of 1965 and 1966, the number of teen-
agers in the civilian labor force (16 to 19 years old) was swollen by
over 1 million, an increase of 14 per cent. This was 2-1/2 times the
average increase of the preceding 3 years. This tremendous surge of new
teenage workers -- the heritage of the baby boom that began about 2
decades ago -- was on the whole successfully absorbed into employment
(or employed in a Federal work program). But the unemployment rate
among youths remains high and accounts for about one-third of all
unemployment. Negro youths have not fared as well as whites over the
past year; the unemployment rate for nonwhite teenagers this summer
was at the same high rate of 27 per cent as last year, while the unemploy-
ment rate for white teenagers dropped from 14 to 12 per cent.
Collective bargaining. Major contract negotiations in the
firsthalf of this year have affected relatively few workers. Contracts
covering only about 835,000 workers were negotiated during the first
6 months -- about half in manufacturing. In manufacturing settlements have
been mainly in the lower paying lumber, textile and apparel industries.

II -17
From here on the pace of contract settlements will be faster.
Already the ariline agreement in August and a comparable settlement
in early Setpember at 5 per cent by the telephone installers appear
to be establishing a pattern of wage increases well above the guide-
posts. It is expected that 350,000 telephone workers will receive
wage increases in the next two months in line with those of the
installers.
Contracts in the electrical products industry expire in
October and this bargaining will affect some 135,000 workers. The
number of workers directly affected by major contract renegotiations in
1967 will be substantially greater.

II -18
In contrast to the small number of new contracts, wage
increases scheduled for this year in major contracts negotiated in
1965 or earlier are affecting a much larger number of workers than in
most recent years. Over 4 million workers were scheduled to receive
deferred wage increases in 1966 under major collective bargaining
agreements, the largest number since 1957. In September and October
alone, deferred increases will raise the wages of 1.2 million workers.
For auto workers, a scheduled productivity increase will total 10.5
cents, or an average increase of 3.4 per cent of straight time earnings.
In most other industries affected -- mainly farm equipment and aerospace,
and metal containers in December -- the rise will be in the 2-1/2 to
3 per cent range.
Over 1-1/2 million of these 4 million workers receiving
deferred wage increases are also covered by contracts with cost-of-
living clauses. With increased pressure from rising prices, cost-
of-living adjustments are having a significant impact on wage rates in
these industries. Automobile workers have received 8 cents an hour in
wage increases over the past year as a result of the rise in consumer
prices. With the 10.5 cents from the annual improvement factor, auto
workers by this month will have received 18.5 cents increase in their
basic wage rate over the past year -- a rise of about 6 per cent.
The pressure of increasing prices is likely to see a renewal
of interest for inclusion of escalator clauses in wage contracts.
The agreement by the airline industry to an escalator clause was a key
factor in the final settlement of the recent machinist strike. The

II -19
electrical workers have now made the reinstatement of an escalator clause
in their contracts with G.E. and Westinghouse a major goal of their
negotiations, and other unions may be expected to follow suit. Popu-
larity of escalator clauses has risen and fallen in the postwar period
with the tide of inflationary pressures. Only 800,000 workers were
covered by contracts including such clauses in September 1950; within
a year the number reached 3 million, and by September 1952, 3.5 million,
mainly in autos and related products and in railroads. This total was
about one-fifth of all workers covered by collective bargaining con-
tracts at that time. With the end of the Korean War in 1953, interest
in escalator clauses diminished, and by the beginning of 1955, less than
2 million workers remained covered. The 1955-57 expansion brought a
renewed surge of interest and coverage rose to a postwar peak of 4
million in 1958 and 1959. Beginning in 1960, escalator clauses were
dropped from contracts in electrical equipment and the railroads and
in the steel, aluminum and container industries. Only about 2 million
workers were covered this year, largely in the relatively high wage
automobile, aerospace, farm and construction equipment, trucking and
meatpacking industries.
Wholesale prices. The monthly wholesale price index for
mid-August will show a further rise, but the rise will not be so large
as the .7 per cent from June to July. Although increases were wide-
spread among foodstuffs, the average for this group is expected to show
only about half the rise of 2.2 per cent in the preceding month.

II -20
After mid-August, expansion in livestock marketings brought about
declines in prices which apparently halted the rise in the over-all
index. Sustained expansion in supplies of meats may now be underway.
As a result mainly of continued decreases among the sensitive
materials, the rise in the industrial commodity index in August has
probably been at about the reduced pace of July. Prices of hides and
lumber, which contributed so much to the rise in industrial commodities
early this year, have declined further in recent weeks, and prices of
most scrap metals have fallen. Copper prices in the London market have
dropped to about 50 cents a pound from 75 cents two months ago and about
95 cents at the high in April; a shift in expectations followed resumption
of shipments from Zambia and elimination of a strike threat in Chile
reinforced by prospects of a decline in consumption in the United
Kingdom. In this country, prices of a few copper products have been
reduced as a result of the declines for scrap copper and for refined
copper from sources other than the primary producers.
It is likely that the price index for other or "sluggish'
industrial materials and the index for finished products continued to
rise in August. The announced increases in steel sheet and strip will
be reflected in the August index, and increases also are known to have
gone into effect for some fabricated metal products, industrial
chemicals, petroleum products, paper boxes, and glass containers. Some
makers of heavy-duty trucks also announced price increases.

II -21
Consumer prices. The consumer price index rose .4 per cent
further in July and, as shown in the table, was 2.8 per cent higher
than a year earlier. Food prices continued to rise, but the increase
was considerably less than seasonal. On a seasonally adjusted basis,
while dairy products and eggs increased, fruits and vegetables and
meats declined.
Services continued on their rapid upward course. July was
the month that the increase in New York City subway and bus fares went
into the index, and that contributed much to the rise in transportation
services. Medical services continued to rise at a rapid pace.
Nonfood commodities rose somewhat in July, reflecting mainly
increases for used cars and cigarettes, with the latter affected by tax
increases. Higher prices were reported also for furniture and some
nondurable household goods. New autos showed less than the usual
seasonal decline, although a larger decrease had been expected in view
of the large number of cars in dealer hands at midyear.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL SITUATION
Bank credit. Preliminary estimates indicate that total
bank credit on a last Wednesday basis increased about $1.5 billion in
August, an annual rate of 5.8 per cent. This was a little more than
half of the July rate of growth and well below the 8.2 per cent average
for the first six months of this year. On a daily average basis, the
member bank credit proxy declined at a 2.0 per cent annual rate during
the month. The discrepancy between these two measures is accounted
for primarily by bank acquisitions of the March and April tax anticipa-
tion bills--fully payable by tax and loan account credit--which were
delivered late in the month. Of the $3 billion total of these bills
sold, practically all to banks, about $2 billion were apparently still
in bank portfolios at month-end. In addition, the member bank credit
proxy understates bank growth somewhat since it excludes foreign branch
borrowing, which has increased recently.
Total loans at commercial banks in August showed little or
no change on a seasonally adjusted basis, in sharp contrast with the
July increase of nearly a 20 per cent annual rate. In the absence of
the large acquisitions of the tax anticipation bills in the last week
of August seasonally adjusted commercial bank holdings of Government
securities also would have remained virtually unchanged, in contrast
with the $2.1 billion increase now estimated. Furthermore, commercial
banks liquidated $600 million in other securities, whereas banks were
able to make substantial net additions of these securities earlier in
the year.

III -2
The sharp departure in August from earlier monthly expansions
of bank loans is accounted for, in part, by the $650 million decline in
loans to finance companies at city banks. These repayments, which were
much larger than seasonal, reflected not only a sizable reduction in
the need for funds as auto inventories declined from their June peaks,
but also a shift in the composition of short-term financing from bank
loans to commercial paper. This shift presumably was partly in response
to firmer lending policies at banks as well as differences in the rela-
tive cost of financing for these borrowers.
The slowdown in total loan expansion in August also was
related to the effects of tax payment schedules on business loan
demand. Previous tax accelerations in June and July reduced withhold-
ing tax payments due during the month by an estimated $1.8 billion.
Preliminary seasonally adjusted figures show business loans declined
$400 million, or at a 6.2 per cent annual rate, in August, after
having increased sharply at a 31 per cent annual rate over the combined
June and July period and an 18 per cent rate for the first 5 months of
the year. Because of the temporal shifting of tax payments, the growth
of business loans over the whole June to August period--an 18.3 per
cent increase, at annual rates--may provide a better reflection of real
trends than the August figure alone, though the new tax schedule for
this 3-month period does include some payments shifted forward from
September. The less than seasonal increase in bank loans in August to
petroleum and chemical firms and the contraseasonal decline in loans
to other manufacturing and mining firms most likely reflected these tax

III -3
shifts. Loans to wholesale and retail trade concerns were also off
sharply, whereas loans to metal and metal products industries remained
strong during the month.
In the last 2 weeks in August the basic reserve position of
New York banks dramatically improved as they curtailed sharply their
borrowing from the Federal Reserve--to zero in the week ending
August 31--and shifted to net sales of Federal funds. Earlier in the
month, they had been net purchasers of Federal funds. These changes
are more indicative of bank preparations for the September pressures
rather than of any over-all easing in the money market. In addition
to selling Federal funds, the New York banks also put some of the funds
they received from the large repayments of business and finance company
loans into short-term assets, such as dealer loans, rather than in
other securities. Moreover, these banks were able to obtain additional
large amounts of funds by borrowing from their foreign branches, as
well as by issuing short-term promissory notes early in August. The
outstanding volume of promissory notes fell sharply during the week
ending August 31, as these notes were to become subject to reserve and
interest rate requirements after September 1.
Bank deposits. Growth in commercial bank time and savings
deposits in August continued at a pace approximately equal to the July
annual rate of 14 per cent. Weekly reporting banks outside of New York
City continued to be highly successful in attracting time deposits,
though they did experience a contraseasonal decline of about $150 million

III -4
in savings deposits. Their outstanding CD's rose by about $170 million
in the 5 weeks ending August 31, and time deposits other than CD's by
more than $530 million, an increase well above that for the comparable
period in previous years. As mentioned in earlier Greenbooks, the
ability of these banks to continue to attract time deposits may reflect
the willingness of their business customers to sacrifice yield to keep
their credit lines open, though some switching out of savings deposits
may have also been operative. At New York City banks, in contrast,
total time and savings deposits declined by $203 million during the
month, reflecting a $260 million run-off in CD's and a small contra-
seasonal decline in savings deposits. Time deposits other than CD's
rose much more than seasonally.
In order to sell new CD's within the 5-1/2 per cent ceiling,
it appears that the larger banks have had to offer mainly short matu-
rities. Consequently, 30 per cent of all CD sales made in August will
mature in September with another 21 per cent falling due in October.
For New York banks more than 60 per cent of their August sales will
mature in these 2 months. September maturities, which already amounted
to $4.0 billion at the end of July, rose to a new record level of almost
$5.3 billion by the end of August. The magnitude of these maturities
was clearly a factor in the evident preparations for September run-offs.
At country banks, time deposit growth slowed down in August
on average, with rapid expansion in July and the early weeks of August
giving way to a decline in flows as August progressed. These banks
were apparently under some pressure during August as their borrowing

III -5
from the Federal Reserve resumed the upward course it had followed
prior to June and July, during which months time deposit inflows at
country banks had accelerated.
The private money stock declined again in August though by
much less than in July. For the two months combined, the reduction
amounted to 7.0 per cent (annual rate), and for the year to date the
annual rate of increase now amounts to only 1.5 per cent. Treasury
deposits dropped $1.6 billion in August following a July rise of
similar size, but loan repayments and attractive yields on money sub-
stitutes prevented this development from greatly influencing the level
of private demand balances.
Corporate and municipal bond markets. Yields on recently
offered corporate bonds, after rising steeply--by as much as 30 basis
points--in the latter part of August, have since been marked down
abruptly erasing most of the preceding rise. In the municipal bond
market the pattern of yield changes has been similar, but the magnitudes
of the rise and fall are more difficult to pin-point because of the
greater variation in maturity and quality among recently offered issues.
Because the published yield series shown in the table are weekly
averages for outstanding issues on which yield changes typically lag
behind those for recently offered issues, the averages do not fully
reflect the steepness of either the late August rise or the most recent
decline. The reoffering yield on the one new corporate bond with 5-year
call protection scheduled for sale this week is expected to adjust to
about 5.90 per cent.

The down-turn in bond yields during the past week has been
chiefly attributable to changed market expectations, following press
leaks indicating the possibility of an Administration proposal for
near-term fiscal action to combat inflation and higher interest rates.
As a result, some of the rather extreme fears of an approaching credit
availability crisis that had developed in late August were moderated.
Reports that sales of Federal participation certificates might be
deferred or reduced in size, and the Federal Reserve statement on dis-
counting, which was taken to suggest that banks would be under less
pressure to liquidate securities, further accentuated the yield reversal.
The impact of the Federal Reserve statement was most
pronounced in the secondary market for municipal bonds where continued---------- ~ -----------

III -7
bank liquidation of holdings had begun to create trading conditions
which many market participants were characterizing as disorderly. The
yield on one large new issue of muhicipal bonds brought to market at
about the time of the statement was subsequently marked down more than
30 basis points, and dealers moved quickly to cover short positions.
By early September the "blue list" of dealers advertised inventories
had dropped to about $250 million, the lowest level reported since
August 1960.
In the corporate bond market one might have expected the
Federal Reserve statement to buttress expectations of an enlarged
corporate bond calendar and thus to create upward pressures on yields.
But corporate bond yields in fact moved down with those in other
markets, apparently reflecting the more important influence on expecta-
tions of the reports of imminent Federal fiscal actions. Thus, the
Aaa-rated AT&T debentures which were reoffered in early August at
5.58 per cent, with 5-year call protection, and then rose to 5.93 per
cent on August 29, have since been marked down about 20 basis points.
Similarly, the Aaa-rated Southern California Edison bonds, offered at
6.05 per cent on August 24, which then rose to 6.28 per cent, have
since dropped back below 6 per cent.
Looking beyond the immediate psychological factors influenc-
ing expectations immediate business demands for long-term financing
remain heavy. The calendar of publicly-offered corporate issues
already scheduled for September exceeds $800 million and ultimately

III -8
seems likely to run to at least $1 billion, nearly as large as the
record $1.2 billion August volume. On the other hand, the restricted
availability of funds among institutional lenders is likely to keep
the volume of private placements at a reduced level. While there are
some reports of businesses deciding to cancel or defer spending and
financing plans, it is difficult to measure the quantitative signif-
icance of these changes.

In the municipal bond market, volume for both September
and the third quarter is expected to run behind a year ago. To some
extent, the year-to-year reduction in volume reflects recent post-
ponements or cancellations of new issues--due largely to the limitations
of interest rate ceilings. In addition, announcements of new listings
on the forward calendar have slowed somewhat in recent weeks. More

III -9
general pressures to finance State and local government expenditure
programs appear to be continuing, however, and any significant yield
decline would very likely bring back some of the borrowers held out
of the market recently.

Flows to financial intermediaries. Final data on
savings flows to mutual savings banks and savings and loan associations
indicate that the S&L's lost $1.5 billion in savings capital during
July, whereas deposits at the mutuals rose a near record $200 million.
Both numbers are larger than previously estimated.

No firm data are yet available on net savings flows for
August, but preliminary estimates for New York State indicate that
mutual savings banks continued to experience near record net inflows,
as in July, while net inflows at S&L's in New York were reportedly no
more than half the already reduced inflow of last August. Preliminary
reports from S&L's in some other areas indicate a roughly similar
experience. In August a year ago net inflows at all S&L's totaled
$550 million.
S&L industry analysts are now looking ahead to the next
quarterly reinvestment period in October with some concern, wondering

III -11
whether that month too will show a net loss of savings capital, as in
the three previous quarterly reinvestment periods. Industry apprehen-
sion about October is heightened by the sharp further advance of yields
on competitive market instruments since July. Also there is some
concern that commercial banks will begin to compete more aggressively
for savings with their consumer-type CD's if these institutions begin
to experience a sizable run-off of large negotiable CD's.
As the table shows, October has not been a typical quarterly
reinvestment period, since neither seasonal nor semi-annual dividend
pressures are present. January, April, and July have built in seasonal
pressures such as Christmas, Tax or vacation payments and both January
and July experience the coincident termination of quarterly and semi-
annual interest accrual periods. Consequently, during the past 20
years S&L's have not experienced any net outflows within the last 5
months of the year and mutual savings banks have had net losses on only
a few occasions during this period.
Since July, S&L's have been pressed by the Home Loan Bank to
repay advances from net gains of savings capital. This policy has been
dictated by the need to conserve lending power within the Home Loan
Bank system preparatory to expected expansion of advances during October.
For this reason, outstanding advances have declined more than season-
ally. At the same time, S&L's have also apparently added to their own
liquidity, raising the average liquidity ratio (without Governments or
a per cent of their control) from the record industry low of 8.94 per
cent reached in July.

III -12
Mutual savings banks, virtually all of which credit interest
quarterly, have also placed a large part of their July and August
savings inflows in short-term investments, presumably in preparation
for their own October reinvestment period. For this reason, deposits
at mutuals have not been reflected in an equivalent increase of new
mortgage loan commitments.
Mortgage market developments. Reflecting the sharp cut-back
in availability of mortgage funds this summer, July mortgage debt held
by the major types of institutional lenders grew only about half as
much as in July a year ago. The availability squeeze was most pronounced
at savings and loan associations--traditionally the major lenders on
homes where July mortgage originations and purchases barely exceeded
the reduction in portfolios from normal amortization and other factors.
Other types of private lenders, with the possible exception of life-
insurance companies, also continued to show their net acquisition of
mortgage debt.

III -13
The net increase in holdings by FNMA in July offset roughly
one quarter of the year-to-year shortfall in debt growth among the
private lenders. In August, however, although offerings to FNMA by
mortgage holders were being maintained at about the July level, pur-
chases by FNMA were below those in July and other recent months,
reflecting steps taken earlier to conserve buying power. Implementa-
tion of the new legislation expanding FNMA's purchasing authority
potentially could permit an increase in FNMA's net acquisition of
mortgages by $600-750 million per quarter over the next two years.
With mortgage credit generally constrained and with interest
rates in other sectors of the capital market rising sharply further
during August, there is little question that mortgage rates increased
further in August. In July, the latest month for which data are avail-
able, the secondary market yield series for 30-year, FHA-insured
mortgages reached an average of 6.51 per cent--6 basis points higher
than in June and 105 basis points above the plateau prevailing a year
ago just before mortgage yields began their steep climb. While the
increase in contract rates for conventional first mortgages for home
purchase has also been substantial since early last autumn, the amount
of rise through July was less pronounced than for FHA-insured yields.
Conventional interest rates (FHA series) reached 6.45 per
cent on loans for new home purchase and 6.55 per cent on loans to
purchase existing homes, both 65-70 basis points higher than a year
earlier.

III -14
Stock market. Stock prices as well as bond prices have
risen on balance from the two year low reached in late August. Very
recently, however, they have been edging lower again. In the Standard
and Poor's composite index, the net advance from the August low amounts
to about 2-1/2 per cent, following an earlier net decline of 21 per
cent from February. The table shows how this decline compares with
other major stock market breaks in the post-war period.

The late August rally developed despite reports of a possible
suspension of the investment tax credit. While some temporary rise in
prices had been anticipated on technical grounds--because of the sus-
tained earlier price decline and the resulting general drop in price-
earnings ratios to levels below those reached at the bottom of the
stock market break in 1962--the price improvement apparently developed

III -15
partly because of the rumored change in the tax credit. Some of the
earlier downward pressure on stock prices had reflected concern that
the likely severity of an increasingly restrictive monetary policy
might trigger serious financial dislocations.
Perhaps the most significant factor contributing to the
general down-trend of stock prices this year has been the deepening
belief among market participants that corporate profits and profit
margins are likely to shrink in the period ahead. This would reduce
earnings below those on which price-earnings ratios are currently
being calculated and would limit opportunities for capital gains.
Given this market expectation, the historically high yields available
on fixed income securities have attracted increased investor interest
vis-a-vis stocks.
The market outlook on corporate profits is, of course,
partly a reflection of uncertainties concerning the chance of more
stringent tax and wage-price policies. In addition, it apparently
reflects expectations that the developing tight money and cost-push
squeeze will be similar to those that occurred prior to the top of
the boom in earlier post-war cycles.

III -16
U. S. Government securities market. The Treasury bond market
registered its sharpest rally in many years at the end of August and in
early September. The rally served to erase 50 to 60 per cent of the
unusually large price decline of the previous five weeks. Treasury bill
rates, on the other hand, continued to move to new highs in the recent
period.

An atmosphere of unrelieved pessimism in
market gave way in late August and early September
optimistic outlook for bond prices, reflecting thethe Treasury bond
to a somewhat more
same influences at
work in other bond markets. The main thrust of the rally in the
Treasury bond market appeared to be provided by dealer demand, including
purchases to cover short positions. Dealer holdings of bonds due after

III -17
5 years rose from a small net short position in late August to a net
long position of over $60 million on September 7.
Treasury bill rates continued to rise in the latter part of
August and in early September, following the Treasury's $3.0 billion
auction of March and April tax bills on August 18. Sizable bank sales
of the new bills were reported and dealer bill positions increased as
a consequence. Tending to moderate the run-up in bill yields and dealer
positions were large System purchases in the market totaling nearly $925
million between August 24 and September 2. Public demand for bills
remained relatively light, however.
The recent advance in bill rates has been accompanied by
only selective yield increases on short-term debt instruments other
than bills, as the accompanying table indicates.

Federal cash position. Despite a $3.0 billion cash financing
in late August, the Treasury's cash operating balance is being drawn
down sharply in the current quarter. The $6.0 billion balance now
projected for the end of September is below the corresponding 1965
figure of $7.5 billion and well below the 1961-64 average of $8.8 billion.
The projected decline in the balance reflects a higher than
usual third quarter cash deficit. Treasury cash payments ran well
above projections in August and receipts fell somewhat short of
expectations. A detailed breakdown of Treasury expenditures in August
will not become available until later in September, but accelerated
military expenditures account for most of the higher spending.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
U.S. balance of payments. Weekly indicators suggest a
payments deficit on the liquidity basis for August somewhat below the
July figure. (revised to $500 million before seasonal adjustment.) For
July and August together, the deficit after seasonal adjustment was
probably somewhat less than $300 million a month.
On the official settlements basis seasonally adjusted, there
were payments surpluses in both July and August, attributable in good
part to the run on sterling (particularly in July) but also to shifts
of foreign private funds from Continental currencies into dollar assets.
Large-scale bidding for Euro-dollars by the European branches of U.S.
banks has contributed importantly to upward pressure on Euro-dollar
interest rates, particularly for short maturities. In July and
August together, these branches provided $1 billion to supplement
money positions of head offices. With these rates at high levels,
some short-term funds have been attracted out of European currencies
into dollar deposits abroad. Thus, since late July in some cases and
mid-August in others, Continental exchange rates have weakened against
the dollar, and a number of central banks have lost reserves supporting
their currencies. French dollar intake of $45 million in August is
believed to have been concentrated early in the month, and in early
September the French franc was quoted at the lowest level in 5 years.
Stringency in U.S. financial markets has also helped hold
down U.S. private capital outflows. Banks reported a net reflow of

IV -2
$147 million in July under the VFCR, following a moderate second-
quarter outflow, bringing the total leeway for expansion within the
target ceilings to $1 billion. Preliminary indications suggest that
in the summer banks may have been making new commitments on term
loans to foreigners at a rate below the $70 million per month average
of the first half, which already implied some net reflows on term
loans. Reflows of bank credits have reflected not only pressures on
U.S. banks, but also changes in the availability of credit abroad.
The July reflow was primarily from Japan, and followed sizable reflows
from that country as well as from Italy in the first half of the year.
In both countries credit markets are relatively easy.
Effects of credit restraint are less evident for other
types of U.S. private capital. Direct investment outflows in the
second quarter, apart from investments of $280 million financed by
sales of securities abroad, were about $650 million (confidential)
until published at month-end) -- little changed from the average of
the three preceding quarters. And new foreign bond issues in the
United States in the third quarter seasonally adjusted were up from
the low second quarter, mainly reflecting a large IBRD issue early
in July.
While money and credit market developments have contributed
both to favorable results on the official settlements balance in the
past month and to some reflows of U.S. capital, internal demand
pressures continue to squeeze the trade surplus, which stands at
the lowest level since late 1959.

IV -3
Imports rose further in July, and the trade surplus declined
to an annual rate of $2-3/4 billion. Average figures for June-July
show imports at a $26 billion annual rate (up $2 billion from the
first quarter) and exports at an annual rate of $29-1/4 billion (up
$1 billion from the first quarter.) The $1 billion decline in the
trade surplus, to an annual rate of $3-1/4 billion, brings it to less
than half the 1964 peak level.
Details on the specific commodities responsible for the rise
in imports, or on the particular markets where exports fell off are
not yet available beyond June, data for which were presented in the
last Green Book.
Payments balances of other countries. The large and persistent
payments deficits of the United States and the United Kingdom have
inevitably been matched by an excess of surpluses over deficits else-
where in the world. As will be seen from the table on the next page,
a wide variety of countries had substantial surpluses during the 6 or
12 months to mid-1966. The general tendency was for the surpluses of
less developed countries to increase, and for those of industrial
countries to diminish. For some countries the position swung widely,
either from deficit toward surplus, as for Australia and South Africa,
or in the opposite direction, as for Spain, Switzerland, and the
Netherlands. France and Italy continue to run the largest surpluses,
although Italy's surplus has diminished significantly over the past
year.

The Common Market countries taken together continued to have
a substantial surplus during the first half of 1966 of the order of
$1-1/2 billion at an annual rate. After rough allowance for seasonal
variations, almost all of that surplus accrued to France and Italy.
The French surplus continued at about the same rate as in earlier
periods. Italy's surplus, however, has declined significantly,
partly as a result of a more rapid increase in imports than in
exports, and partly owing to the emergence since mid-1965 of net
capital outflows in place of earlier inflows.
Both Germany and the Netherlands had deficits during the
year to mid-1966. In Germany, however, a substantial surplus has
reemerged since last spring as a result mainly of the strong expansion
of exports that got underway towards the end of 1965. And a sharp
deterioration in the payments balance of the Netherlands during the
first quarter of 1966, both on current and capital account, was
partly reversed in the second quarter. Belgian reserves declined
during the first half of 1966 as the trade balance weakened and capital
inflows were lower than a year earlier.
In Switzerland, the other main European member of the Group
of Ten, shifts in capital movements appear to explain the large
reserve losses experienced during the first half of 1966. Higher
interest rates abroad, especially on the larger volume of long-term
dollar-denominated bonds offered in Europe, have attracted funds
from Switzerland.

IV -6
Among industrial countries outside Europe, Canada lost
reserves in more than seasonal amount during the first half of 1966,
but this was the outcome of a deliberate Government policy of reducing
reserves (and net capital inflows from the United States) by redeeming
Canadian bonds from U.S. holders in advance of maturity, and did not
appear to reflect the emergence of an underlying payments deficit.
Japan has remained in substantial surplus (on a calculation including
commercial bank positions as well as the official reserve position),
although in recent months official reserves have declined as the
commercial banks have shifted from foreign to domestic financing of
imports and have repaid debt to the United States.
Major developed countries outside the Group of Ten have
experienced large payments fluctuations over the past year. Spain has
had a very large deterioration in its international transactions,
shifting deep into deficit after several years of large surplus.
Australia and South Africa, on the other hand, have corrected earlier
deficits and moved into substantial surplus. Much of the Australian
shift resulted from an increase in capital inflows. South Africa has
cut imports sharply by means of direct import controls as well as
internal policies of restraint, and capital inflows have increased.
Recently, the import controls have begun to be relaxed again.
Incomplete data for less developed countries indicate
continued substantial payments surpluses and reserve gains during
the first half of 1966. Buoyant economic activity in industrial

IV -7
countries has kept markets for primary commodities generally strong.
The surge in reserves of the petroleum producing countries early in
1966 is largely attributable to Libya, which had extra receipts
arising from retroactive renegotiation of contracts, as the other
countries had a year earlier. The international transactions and
reserves of a number of Asian countries, including Thailand, Taiwan,
Korea, and the Philippines, have been favorably affected by U.S.
expenditures related to the war in Viet Nam.

APPENDIX A: FNMA BILL AND MORTGAGE MARKETS*
Now awaiting the President's signature is a bill (S.3688)
to provide the Federal National Mortgage Association with nearly $4.8
billion in additional authority to purchase FHA-insured and VA-guaranteed
home mortgages. Of that total, $1 billion would go toward a special
assistance program. Almost $3.8 billion would be for FNMA's secondary
market operations, as indicated in Table 1. At present, FNMA mortgage
holdings acquired under existing legislation exceed $6.3 billion.
Benefits and costs
If all the $4.8 billion were directed into new housing, the bill
could finance as many as 317,000 housing starts, assuming an average
mortgage amount of $15,000 per dwelling. A substantial share of the
funds released by FNMA's mortgage purchases, however, will likely leak
out into other uses. Unless FNMA concentrates its activity in mortgages
on new rather than on existing homes, perhaps somewhat more than half
of the funds total will go toward financing existing homes which will
stimulate new housing only indirectly.
The full impact of the bill on the availability of mortgage
credit and on housing starts will, of course, be considerably delayed;
the bulk of the funds ($3.8 billion of the $4.8 billion total) must be
obtained by selling new FNMA debentures in a congested capital market.
This, as well as high interest costs, dictates financing in moderately-
sized individual chunks over a number of quarters -- particularly so if
the yield spread favoring mortgages over debentures should narrow further
and make it more difficult for FNMA to break even. In addition, the lag
may reflect difficulties that building firms encounter in obtaining temporary
construction loans from private sources if credit remains tight.
One of the positive results of the legislation will be to
facilitate indirectly the purchase of new houses by providing financing
for the sale of some older houses. In current markets, many new-home
buyers are finding difficulty in meeting required downpayments because
they are unable to find buyers for their existing homes who can obtain
the necessary financing. Another result will be to ease the currently
unsettled state of the mortgage market, thus giving home builders some
basis for advance planning. A third effect will be to keep intact some
building organizations that might otherwise disband because of inability
to finance their operations on even a limited basis.

Funds Raised
and UsedMechanics of
Operation
Special assistance program:
$1 billion to be borrowed
from the Treasury as required to
pay for purchases. Funds would
be used to acquire FHA and VA
mortgages solely on new homes
started after date of Act, in face
amounts not exceeding $15,000 each
($17,500 in "high cost" areas and
$22,500 in Alaska, Guam, and
Hawaii).
Secondary market operations:
$3.76 billion, to be borrowed
ultimately from the general
public by issuing short-term
notes or debentures. Funds
would be used to acquire FHA
and VA mortgages on new or
existing homes.Advance commitments to purchase loans
would be issued first by FNMA, probably
at or near par. This price would be
substantially above the current market
(in July, FHA reports indicated that
secondary market discounts on 30-year
loans averaged 6-1/2 points; in August,
discounts probably exceeded 7 points).
Actual purchases would come later when
completed loans were submitted to FNMA.
In a similar program (Number 10) in
1958, FNMA commitments were made over
a 7-month period and were picked up
later with an average lag between date
of commitment and date of purchase
exceeding 6 months. Altogether, about
85 per cent of the number of commitments
issued were taken down by FNMA during a
period when the mortgage market was
generally easing. More than four-fifths
of FNMA's commitments were made at par
(then 1 to 2 points above the market);
the remainder, closed toward the end of
the program, were made at prices slightly
above the market.
No advance commitments would be issued.
Seller submits offering to FNMA for
agency to buy loans under FNMA-posted
price schedule. If acceptable, FNMA
approves offerings by entering into
purchase contract to buy, usually for
immediate delivery. The lag between FNMA
approval and FNMA purchase generally runs
about 45 days.
In addition to setting prices, FNMA may
impose other conditions, such as age of
acceptable mortgage (currently must be no
older than 4 months), outstanding balance
of loan (currently must not exceed
$15,000), amount of FNMA stock that seller
must subscribe to when sale is consummated
(currently 1 per cent of unpaid balance of
mortgages sold), and purchase and marketing
fee (currently 1/2 of 1 per cent of unpaid
loan balance).__

A- 3
The program seems likely also to provide some early stimulus
to housing but with a delayed impact on capital markets for permanent
financing. Advance purchasing commitments made by FNMA under its special-
assistance program would be taken down, on the average, perhaps no sooner
than two quarters later. FNMA purchase contracts executed under its
secondary-market operations for immediate loan delivery would ordinarily
be taken don more than a month later, and sometimes with a lag of as
long as 2-1/2 months. (Table 1) In the interim, of course, short-term
construction and/or warehousing credit would have to be obtained from
private sources.
On the less positive side of the scale, financing of FNMA's
mortgage purchases, under either its expanded regular secondary-market
program or the new special assistance program, will require the flotation
of additional agency or Treasury obligations, putting further pressure
on already congested markets. Also, at a time when construction materials
and labor are under strain in many places, additional credit supplied
for home building--without further restraint on credit available to other
sectors of the economy--may well result partly in still higher construction
costs as well as in expanded output. Even now, for example, unemployment
in the construction industry as a whole is still low, although the full
effects of the sharply reduced rate of housing starts have not yet been
fully reflected in construction employment.
Special assistance program. The $1 billion in special assistance
funds will go toward loans solely on new housing. A large portion of
this total will presumably find its way into financing housing starts
that would not otherwise occur in a period of tight mortgage money. This
conclusion is based on the assumption that a majority of the additional
Treasury borrowing needed to finance these FNMA purchases will draw funds
that would not otherwise be used (1) to finance mortgage acquisitions, or
(2) as savings deposits in mortgage-lending institutions. But in view of
the current high rates on Treasury obligations and the liquidity squeeze
on many lenders, some substitution of public for private credit will
inevitably occur.
The windfalls (to builders and/or mortgage companies) under this
program will be large, since it appears likely that FNMA--following
Congressional intent--will make commitments to buy these loans at or very
near par, although discounts in the private mortgage market are now
perhaps 7 points or more. Because the bill requires that all new-house
loans purchased must be originated after the effective date of the
legislation, sales to FNMA of loans taken out of existing warehoused
inventories or sales of mortgages made under earlier commitments would
not be possible.
Secondary market operations. A substantial part of FNMA's
authorization for expanded secondary-market operations is likely to go
into existing housing, unless FNMA takes offsetting administrative steps
to direct the bulk of the aid into new-home loans. One possible change
that FNMA might make would be to set a differential ceiling on the
unpaid balances of different types of home loans that it stands ready

A -4
to buy. This ceiling would be set at a substantially higher level for
net-home loans than for existing-home loans. At present, the same
ceiling of $15,000 applies to both types of loan collateral, although
the average amount of loan underwritten by FHA or VA runs a fifth to
a sixth larger on new homes than on existing homes.
Other considerations will also influence the stimulus to
the housing market provided by the provisions of the bill. They
include the willingness and ability of builders and old-house sellers
to absorb the unusually large discounts that will undoubtedly be asso-
ciated with FNMA's secondary-market purchases of loans. These discounts
will be substantial even though FNMA does not necessarily have to break
even over the short-run in order to fulfill the statutory injunction
that its secondary-market activities should be "within its income derived
from such operations and that such operations should be fully self-
supporting."
Under current conditions in capital markets, FNMA might have
to pay as much as 6-1/4 per cent if it floated 1-year debentures to
raise needed funds. In addition, FNMA would incur home-office overhead
costs of about 20 basis points, and would have to pay its standard
servicing costs on the mortgages of 50 basis points. If FHA and VA loans
continue to bear a face contract rate of 5-3/4 per cent per annum, FNMA
would have to buy the mortgages at an average discount of approximately
10 points (at a price close to 90) in order to break even. If FHA and VA
contract rates should be raised by administrative action to the 6 per
cent statutory ceiling, discounts charged by FNMA would still average
around 8 points. For used-house sellers also paying (in many cases) a
fee of 6 per cent to a real estate broker, total selling costs could
come to nearly 14 to 16 per cent.
Keeping in mind the long-run statutory objective of breaking
even, FNMA could nevertheless buy mortgages in the near future at somewhat
higher prices (smaller discounts) that might not fully cover its current
costs. This step might be taken in the hope that FNMA could roll over
its debentures at some later time at lower rates and so eventually make
ends meet. As a practical matter, the step would have to be taken in
order to stay at (or close to) going prices in the private market,
where discounts now probably average 7 points or more.
Raising funds for FNMA debentures.
One obvious risk of FNMA's secondary market operations is
that the agency's financing at prevailing market rates will divert some
funds from lenders or from savers that might otherwise have gone into
mortgages.
Through the first five months of this year, FNMA outstanding
indebtedness expanded by $1.3 billion. Of this total increase, "all
other investors" (including bank trust funds) took 64 per cent, and

A-5
state and local general funds took 22 per cent. Commercial banks
acquired nearly 10 per cent, while savings banks, savings and loan
associations, and life insurance companies took virtually nothing.
For the "other investors" category--accounting for nearly
two-thirds of the total--there is no information as to size of holding
or source of funds. Some insight into the behavior of "small savers,"
however, may be obtained from unpublished, confidential information
about the initial reception of FNMA's offerings of August 10. Of the
total issue of $350 million, $300 million was offered privately at a
coupon rate of 5-7/8 per cent, and reoffered at 5.91 per cent. The
following table shows the distribution of private takedowns of
debentures by the end of the first day of re-registration:
Outstanding Amount as
Denomination Amount per cent
Number (millions) of total
$ 1,000 2,200 $ 2
5,000 2,180 11 4
10,000 3,535 35 12
50,000 593 30 10
100,000 2,219 222 74
$300 100
Only one-sixth of the total amount was in the form of debentures in
denominations of $10,000 or less.
Assume that "other investors" account for as much as 70 per
cent of the future expansion in FNMA debentures and that as much as 30
per cent of this share might be taken by "small savers," possibly out
of existing savings or out of savings flows usually routed to trad-
itional mortgage-lending institutions. On these assumptions, perhaps
a fifth of the total amount of FNMA debentures might involve a sub-
stitution of credit otherwise used for mortgage lending.
Buying mortgage loans.
In recent years, four-fifths or more of all mortgages bought
by FNMA under its secondary market operations have been offered by
mortgage companies and related institutions. Banks and trust companies
have accounted for nearly all the remainder.
Over the recent past, FNMA has maintained a 4-month rule
(loans submitted must not be more than 4 months old) on offerings,
partly in order to limit the volume of its purchases. It seems likely

A -6
that this 4-month rule will continue to be imposed, in order to prevent
lenders from perhaps unloading a considerable volume of older FHA and
VA loans (even at quite large discounts) on FNMA so as to raise funds
for liquidity or for other lending purposes.
Continued imposition of the 4-month rule should inhibit the
direct substitution of FNMA for private holdings, thus limiting the
achievement of FNMA's statutory objective of "providing a degree of
liquidity for mortgage investments..." Even so, the maximum potential
amount of substantial credit could still be large. In the most recent
four-month period (April through July), FHA and VA underwrote a total
of $2.8 billion in mortgages on new and existing homes. During the
same period, FNMA purchased a total of $700 million under its secondary-
market operations.
It seems probable that FNMA will lift its present restrictive
$15,000 ceiling on the maximum amount of mortgage that it will buy.
If this limit were increased to, say $25,000, nearly all FHA and VA
loans would become eligible for submission by this test. Nevertheless,,
the 4-month rule might well prevent FNMA from buying many FHA and VA
loans now in warehouse that may exceed $15,000 in face amount.
The volume of loans now being warehoused by mortgage companies
without commitments from permanent private investors probably does not
exceed $300 million, according to the best current estimates of the
Mortgage Bankers Association of America. This figure probably includes
some loans underwritten more than 4 months ago. But even if FNMA took
down the entire amount, its action would, in effect, involve a sub-
stitution of credit of no more than $300 million.
As long as FNMA purchasing prices remain attractive, a con-
siderable volume of submissions could continue to come from mortgage
companies acting, in effect, as FNMA's agent even without advance
commitments. Mortgage companies will continue to push FHA and VA loans
(despite large discounts) for resale to FNMA in order to build up their
servicing volume at an attractive fee (FNMA still pays an annual
servicing fee of 1/2 of 1 per cent of the outstanding loan amount; many
private mortgage holders now pay only 3/8 of 1 per cent, or less), and
in order to derive whatever capital gain may be possible after deducting
expenses of interim warehousing (now said to range between 6 and 6-1/4
per cent).
New versus existing homes.
In the first half of this year, about three-fourths of the
record volume of FNMA's secondary market purchases were accounted for
by loans on existing homes rather than on new ones. This portion was
not far out of line with the share of loans then being underwritten by
FHA and VA on older houses. Particularly in view of the fact that
$1 billion of FNMA's special assistance funds will go exclusively to

A -7
acquire FHA and VA loans on new houses, it seems difficult to believe
that the new-home share of FNMA's total purchases under its secondary
market operations will increase in the future, unless offsetting
administrative actions are taken, as mentioned earlier.
If FNMA continues to purchase about three-fourths of its
mortgages on old houses, most of this credit would be used, in effect
to refinance outstanding mortgages on the older houses that are paid
off at the time of sale. A reasonable assumption seems to be that
between two-thirds and three-fourths of the amount of new loans might
go toward replacing outstanding loans. If so, a third to a fourth
would go toward expanding the amount of credit secured by the properties.
A crucial question, then, is the extent to which holders of
loans that are then paid off will put the funds back into the mortgage
market by making new commitments. This is hard to answer precisely,
in view of the sharp structural strains being placed on all sectors of
the capital market. Certainly, there are attractive--if not compelling--
alternatives to mortgage investment.

APPENDIX B: REVISION OF NONFARM PAYROLL DATA*
Data on employment, hours and earnings in August reflect the
revision by BLS to March 1965 benchmark levels and recalculation of
seasonal factors for the adjusted series. The revision to benchmark
levels was carried back to March, 1964 for most series. Unadjusted
data on average hours and earnings in manufacturing were little changed
by the revision. New benchmarks for religious hospitals and agricultural
services, however, result in revised employment levels for service and
total nonfarm employment beginning with January 1958. The seasonally
adjusted series have been revised starting with January 1955.

The revised level of total nonfarm employment, seasonally
adjusted, was about 450,000 higher in the second quarter this year than
the old estimates. The major revisions were in services (up 200,000)
and trade (up 133,000). Manufacturing employment was relatively little
affected -- up 73,000. The effect of revised seasonal factors for average
weekly hours of production workers in manufacturing on the series this
year was to eliminate the February high of 41.6 hours and to extend the
period of stability at 41.5 hours through May.
