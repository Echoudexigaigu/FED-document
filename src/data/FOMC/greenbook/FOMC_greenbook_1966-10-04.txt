SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK
Outlook for GNP
Most evidence continues to point to increases in GNP in the
$14-15 billion range in the third and fourth quarters. With price
increases absorbing half the dollar gains, real growth would be at the
rate of about 4 per cent a year, as compared with 2 per cent in the
second quarter and 6 per cent in the first.
Expansion of defense spending continues to dominate the
outlook. Such spending appears to have accelerated sharply further
since midyear; increases are now estimated at $3-1/2 to $4 billion a
quarter in the second half of the year, up from $2.5 billion in the
second quarter and an average quarterly increase of about $2.0 billion
over the preceding three quarters.
A further sizable increase in business fixed investment seems
likely for the rest of the year, in line with reported business spending
plans, the large backlog of orders on hand in machinery and equipment
industries, and -- for manufacturers and utilities -- the large carry-
over of projects underway at midyear. However, new orders for machinery
and equipment declined in August and further declines may be in prospect
as a result of the proposed suspension of the investment tax credit.
Financial restraint seems also to be an increasingly important limita-
tion; many manufacturers report also finding their internal funds less
adequate relative to their spending and their external sources of
financing more difficult to tap.
Manufacturers plan some slackening in inventory accumulation
in the fourth quarter from the high second -- and probably third --
quarter rates. Such a development would be reinforced by restrained

I-2
business lending by banks. Residential construction activity continues
to decline sharply, with mortgage funds difficult and costly to obtain.
With permits continuing to decline, near-term prospects for any signif-
icant rebound in housing activity are dim.
As projected earlier and as confirmed by data through August,
disposable personal income and spending have stepped up sharply from the
low rate of gain in the second quarter, but rising consumer prices con-
tinue to account for a major part of the increase in dollar expenditures.
The decline in auto sales in the first 20 days of September is difficult
to interpret because of the earlier new model introductions this year.
The magnitude of the consumer spending rise in the fourth quarter -- now
projected as almost as large as in the third quarter -- will depend in
large measure on public reception of the new -- and higher priced --
autos.
The outlook for prices
The pace of the prospective increases in output points to
continued expansion at a rate that will maintain pressures on available
resources. Although the increase in the industrial production index
has been at a less rapid pace in recent months than in the first half of
the year, it has nevertheless continued to exceed the estimated rate of
growth in capacity, and utilization of manufacturing capacity remains at
the highest level since the period of the Korean War.
Pressures on labor resources also are likely to be maintained.
With an overall unemployment rate that has hovered around 4 per cent this

I-3
year, rates for the various categories of experienced and skilled workers
have remained extremely low.
The sharp rise in the consumer price index this year has led
to sizable increments in wages in those industries where labor contracts
include cost-of-living clauses and is contributing to demands for sub-
stantial wage advances in those industries where contracts are being or
are soon to be renegotiated.
Wage increases provided for in new contracts will undoubtedly
exceed those of recent years and will exceed the rate of improvement in
productivity, and labor costs per unit of output are likely to show more
of an uptrend than heretofore. The prospects for prices thus are that
the upward pull of strong demands will be reinforced by an upward push
of costs. The degree of acceleration in wages and costs is difficult to
judge, but it may be tempered by growing expectations of tax increases
next year; such expectations not only give rise to anticipations for
after-tax profits and also increase uncertainties about the strength of
demand for some goods and services.
Demand for funds
Business demands for loans from banks in October can be
expected to be quite strong in large part because during that month the
acceleration of corporate payments of withheld individual income taxes
will again increase the cash needs of business. October tax payments
will be about $2.7 billion larger than would have been the case under
the old schedule. In addition, continued relatively large business

I-4
inventory accumulation expected during the fall will sustain business
demands for bank credit in the coming month.
The need for business external financing is likely to be
reflected in sizable demand on the corporate bond market, too. Corporate
underwriters generally see no reason to expect any significant let-up of
continuing business financing pressures on capital markets. However, the
September calendar turned out to be about three-fifths of the unusually
large August total, which had reflected some acceleration of planned
offerings. The volume of offerings thus far scheduled for October is
still less than half the August total, but it is already much larger than
the supply ultimately marketed in October 1965.
In the municipal market, the volume of new offerings being
scheduled is continuing to fall short of a year ago, although if interest
rates decline it is possible that demands postponed earlier may return
to the market.
Federal Government credit demands will be large during the
months immediately ahead, with net cash borrowing during the final
quarter of the year estimated to be about 30 per cent more than last year's
heavy $5.7 billion. The great bulk of the borrowing is likely to be in
the bill market.
Source of funds
The banking system is likely to remain hard pressed to
accommodate loan demands. The more restrictive lending programs already
undertaken by banks may be a factor in keeping loan growth below the very

I-5
rapid rate of the first eight months of the year. Still, the process
of banks losing funds to the market is likely to continue in October --
especially at large banks who rely heavily on negotiable CD's -- and
banks may have to make further adjustments in their portfolios, lending
terms, or propensity to borrow from the System.
As of yet, only a few banks are showing an increased inclina-
tion to make use of the discount window. Thus, it is not clear that
banks will choose to borrow rather than to make the portfolio adjustments
that would sustain their ability to make loans. With U.S. Government
security holdings diminished, bank portfolio adjustments may be princi-
pally in the municipal market and perhaps also in reduced mortgage
lending.
In the period ahead, banks' ability to obtain consumer-type
time deposits -- which have recently been growing less rapidly -- may
have been lessened somewhat further because of the new structure of rate
ceilings on time and savings accounts at banks and other savings institu-
tions. Savings and loan associations and mutual savings banks particularly
in the key California and New York City areas are likely to be the
principal beneficiaries of the new rate structure. This influence,
together with the increase in FNMA secondary market purchasing authority,
will have the effect of adding to the availability of mortgage money.
But these two tendencies toward ease are likely to be offset in the
period immediately ahead by the competition of prevailing money and
capital market yields with savings rates.

I- 6
Given the rate structure on time and savings accounts, the
process of financial disintermediation is likely to continue, with a
large part of lendable funds moving directly into the market from
individual investors. During recent weeks, individuals have apparently
been active buyers at advanced yield levels of municipals -- of both new
securities and seasoned issues sold by banks. While bank selling appears
to have tapered off recently, market participants are sensitive to the
fact that any greater than seasonal build-up in business demands for bank
credit this autumn could force a renewal of such bank liquidation.
Heavy reliance on individual investors as a source of funds
has often been accompanied by rising long-term interest rates. In
recent weeks, the tendency for long-term rates to rise under such con-
ditions has been moderated, and partly reversed, by expectational factors
related to Vietnam peace rumors and/or a tax increase. In addition, some
of the past credit demand appears to have been anticipatory, and this has
also taken some pressure off the market currently.
Over the period ahead, future private credit demands, though
they may be somewhat more moderate than in the past, will be joined by
strong U.S. Government demands. As a result, over-all demands are
likely to press against available supply, and interest rates are likely
to rise. The rise may result from pressures generated initially in the
short-term market and also from the absence of large institutional
demands for securities. If interest rates do not tend to rise -- given
the current outlook for the supply of funds and for Government credit
demands -- it may be an indication that business expenditures are being
cut and credit demands consequently reduced.

I- 7
Balance of payments
During September money market tightness in this country
continued to draw in foreign private liquid funds via the Euro-dollar
market. Also U.S. banks may have further reduced their outstanding
foreign loans and credits; net reflows of bank credit in July and August
were better than seasonal, and new term loan commitments have been
running at a reduced rate.
Strength of the dollar in exchange markets during the past
month or two reflects private capital movements, and especially the
efforts of U.S. banks to draw in funds from abroad. The growth in U.S.
banks' short-term liabilities to their branches abroad has amounted to
nearly $1-1/2 billion since midyear. As U.S. short-term liabilities to
other commercial banks and to private foreigners other than banks have
not been reduced, the impact has fallen entirely on foreign central bank
reserves -- which have risen less than seasonal forces and the underlying
payments position would have caused them to. Thus the U.S. balance on
the official reserve transactions basis during the third quarter has
been a large surplus, about $1 billion after seasonal adjustment and
about $1/2 billion unadjusted.
The underlying payments position remains in deficit. U.S.
merchandise imports eased off slightly in August, but the July-August
average still showed an increase at an annual rate of about 20 per cent
measured either from late 1965 or from early 1966. U.S. merchandise
exports failed to

I- 8
rise further in August. On this account and because of the very high
July imports, the trade surplus during July and August was down to an
annual rate of less than $3 billion; this compared with $4.8 billion in
1965, $4.5 billion in the first quarter of 1966, and $3.4 billion in the
second quarter.
The marked worsening of the trade balance between the first
and second quarters reflected not only the steady rise in U.S. imports,
but also a slackening at that time in the pace of U.S. export expansion,
related in part to a slowing in the previously rapid rise in Continental
European countries' imports. Around midyear U.S. exports moved up to a
new plateau, assisted by advancing import demands in Japan, France, and
Italy, as well as in non-industrial countries. Current hopes and expec-
tations of a 2nd-halfyear trade surplus above a $3-1/2 billion rate imply
a fairly strong rise during the rest of the year in aggregate import
demands of foreign countries, as well as a moderation of the growth in
U.S. import demand.
Even if these expectations for exports and imports are ful-
filled, the over-all payments deficit on the liquidity basis seems
likely to be between $2 and $2-1/2 billion, annual rate, during the
present half year. Preliminary indications for July, August, and a
part of September are consistent with this prospect. During this half
year the balance is being benefited by Italian and French debt prepay-
ments totalling over $200 million, of which about $70 million has been
received by September 28. The liquidity deficit would be larger and the
official reserve transactions surplus (cited earlier) smaller, in the
absence of these prepayments.

THE ECONOMIC PICTURE .IN DETAIL
The Nonfinancial Scene
Gross national product. Gross national product is projected
at an annual rate of $746.5 billion in the current quarter and $761.0
billion in the final quarter of the year. These figures and the in-
dicated quarterly gains of $14-15 billion are little changed from those
indicated by the projection of three -- and also six -- weeks ago.
In real terms, total output is still projected as increasing
at an annual rate of close to 4 per cent in each of the last two
quarters of the year; the rate in the first quarter was 6 per cent,
in the second quarter 2 per cent. Prices, particularly of consumption
items, have risen a little faster in recent months than expected
earlier.
Underlying data which have become available in recent weeks
imply slightly different patterns of development for several of the
major expenditure categories than were projected earlier. Consumption
expenditures are now projected at a slightly higher level than before --
they have been raised $1.5 billion in the third quarter and $2.0 billion
in the fourth. Although some easing apparently occurred in retail sales
in September, following a sharp run-up the preceding 3 months, large
gains were registered for the third quarter as a whole for most types

II -2
of merchandise. Expenditures for autos are still being estimated
for the third quarter and projected for the fourth on the basis of an
8.5 million annual rate for new domestic cars, as compared with 7.8
million in the second quarter.
Although personal income is expected to show sizable gains
in both the third and fourth quarters, the relatively large increases
projected for consumption expenditures and continued substantial in-
creases in personal tax payments are resulting in a small drop in the
ratio of personal saving to disposable income.
Private construction outlays, both residential and business,
were revised down moderately in the current projection. Residential
outlays were reduced because of a further decline in housing starts in
August, and business construction was lowered on the basis of recent
changes indicated by the new construction put-in-place data. The increase
projected for total business fixed investment, including producers'
durable equipment as well as business structures, embodies business
plans as reported in the August Commerce-SEC plant and equipment survey.
Defense expenditures apparently are accelerating even faster
than anticipated three weeks ago. On the other hand, net outlays by
the Commodity Credit Corporation are now expected to continue in smaller
volume than in earlier years and this is acting to limit the rise in
"other Federal purchases" in the last half of the year.
Quarterly changes now projected for GNP imply continued in-
tensive use of productive resources -- particularly manufacturing
capacity. Consequently, pressure on prices is projected to continue
about as strong as in the first half of the year.

Industrial production. Available production data for September
are insufficient to estimate the industrial production index, particularly
in view of the usual large seasonal rise which must be allowed for
from August to September. Only fragmentary information is available:
output of steel ingots has increased about seasonally. Auto assemblies
through September 23, although they failed to meet earlier production
schedules, indicate a rate about 10 per cent above the sharply reduced
August level but 15 per cent below the rate prevailing earlier in the
year. Fourth quarter schedules suggest a further rise to an average
annual rate of 8.9 million units, which would be 5 per cent below a
year earlier. In the first three weeks of September, output of color
television sets changed little while monochrome sets and home radios
declined. Truck production rebounded from the model changeover low and
was about unchanged from the advanced levels prevailing earlier.
The increase in the total index has slowed considerably from
the extraordinary pace earlier in the year, as shown in the table.
While all components of the index, except nondurable materials, recorded
a slower rate of increase in the second quarter of 1966 than in the
first, four showed some acceleration from June to August. The sharp
decline in auto assemblies from June to August amounted to .5 of one
point in the total index. Exclusive of the decline in auto assemblies,
the annual rate of change in the over-all index from June to August was
the same as from the first to the second quarter.

The decline in new private housing starts in recent months
has not (through August) led to actual declines in output of home goods
and construction materials. The rate of increase in output of home goods,
however, has slowed considerably in the latest period, as shown in the
table, and since May, production of construction materials has been stable
at a level about 5 per cent below the March peak. Output of iron and
steel has changed little since last May at a level exceeded only by the
peak in July 1965.
Retail sales. Retail sales in early September, according to
weekly figures, may have slackened off slightly from the advanced August
level. In the first two weeks of the month, however, they were 9 per
cent above a year earlier.--- --- --

II -6
Sales increased 1.5 per cent in August, with gains in both
durable goods -- autos and furniture and appliances -- and nondurable
goods -- particularly apparel. The total was up 10 per cent from a
year earlier as compared with a 9 per cent rise in personal income.
The August sales increase extended the rise that began in
June -- the total increase from May to August amounted to 6 per cent --
and brought the level of total retail sales above the preceding high
reached last March. With new auto sales in August still well below
March -- although up considerably from the May low -- total dollar sales
of durable goods stores remained below March. Nondurable goods sales,
on the other hand, were substantially higher than in March -- with
appreciable gains in prices a significant factor in steadily rising
dollar volume.
Unit auto sales and inventories. Sales of new domestic autos
in the first 20 days of September were down 15 per cent from a year
earlier and 22 per cent from a month ago. This decline probably re-
flects the lessened consumer interest in the old models prior to the
introduction of the majority of the 1967 models on September 29.
Strong sales in the last 10 days of September, however, are expected
to raise the seasonally adjusted annual sales rate of domestic cars to
something close to 8.5 million units for the month. Dealer inventories
are expected to increase further by month end, to 1.3 million units.
Consumer credit. Preliminary reports for August and early
September suggest continuation of the instalment credit expansion at

II -7
about the July rate, or perhaps a little faster. The increase in July
was $6.8 billion, seasonally adjusted annual rate, up from $6.3 in
the second quarter but below the $7.1 billion rate of the first quarter.
Activity picked up in the auto credit area in August along
with the improvement in new car sales, but other types of consumer
instalment credit apparently showed little more than the usual seasonal
changes. Demands for credit to purchase appliances and other home goods
had been especially strong earlier in the summer.
Credit played a more important role than usual in new car
sales in recent months. During June and July, nearly 4 out of 5 new
cars sold involved the use of credit financing. This was a considerably
higher proportion than during the same two months in other recent years.
High inventories of 1966 models and prospective early introduction of 1967
models spurred dealers to extra sales efforts; credit buyers are
typically attracted into the market in such circumstances.
There has not been any easing of terms; indeed, auto terms
have tightened somewhat this year. The proportion of new car contracts
written for 36 months was rising steadily by 2 or 3 points a year from
1961 to 1965, but in 1966 there has been little further change, and
lately, even a slight decrease. Buyers of used cars also have found
it more difficult to obtain unusually long maturities. Major sales
finance companies report a sizable decline this spring and summer in
used car contracts in the over-30-month category.

II -8
Personal income. Personal income in August showed the largest
monthly gain of the year, rising $5 billion to a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of $585 billion, nearly 9 per cent above a year earlier.
The acceleration came mainly from a $1-1/2 billion spurt in transfer
payments as the pay-out of benefits under the Medicare program reached
sizable volume. These benefits had shown only a slight gain in July,
the first month of the new program.
Wage and salary disbursements increased $3 billion, about the
same as the July and June increases but more than in the spring months.
Manufacturing payrolls showed a pronounced spurt, after showing little
change in July, while construction employment and payrolls declined.
There were further advances in trade and service industries and govern-
ment.
Personal interest income increased appreciably further. The
volume of farm marketings was down and despite higher prices, another
drop was reported in farm proprietors' income -- to a level 12 per cent
below the peak reached last March.
Construction activity. Value of construction put in place
declined slightly further in August. The decline, which followed down-
ward revisions of 1 per cent or more for July in all major private
categories, was to the lowest rate since last October, a rate 8 per cent
below the recent peak in March.
Reflecting the sharp and pervasive further contraction in
housing starts and permits in recent months, further attrition in

II -9
residential construction expenditures is indicated over the period
ahead. The extended boom in nonresidential expenditures also may have
already passed its peak, although unlike residential activity, the ad-
justments within the nonresidential group have been quite selective.
For example, the decline (through July) was concentrated in commercial
structures and in religious, educational and related building; expendi-
tures for public utilities, on the other hand, have been maintained at
an advanced rate and expenditures for industrial plants have moved
irregularly higher. The lower rate of commercial construction possibly
may reflect mainly seasonal adjustment problems instead of underlying
weakness. In the previous two years, this series also slowed or declined
during the early summer months only to soar again in the latter part
of the year.
Revised data available for state and local construction for
the first half of the year suggest that a peak in public construction
may have been reached in February, although the reduction since then
has been moderate.

Seasonally adjusted private housing starts, which were re-
vised upward somewhat for July, dipped further in August. This left
the rate still barely above the recession low in December 1960 and marked
the fifth consecutive month of decline, a development almost without
precedent in the history of the series. On a three-month moving
average basis, the rate for the June-August period was 1.14 million,
a third below the recent high reached in early 1964.
The downward movement of starts may not yet have run its
course. Building permits, for example, also were down sharply further
in August. (Unlike starts, seasonal adjustment of the permits series
includes an explicit allowance for the number of working days.)
As in the other months this year, the decline has affected all regions
and was greater for multifamily structures than for single family
dwellings.

Orders for durable goods. New orders for durable goods
declined about 5 per cent in August, according to advance figures, after
being relatively stable from April to July at a level moderately below
the March peak. August orders remained above shipments but the rise
in unfilled orders was the smallest since August 1965 and was only one-
third of the average gain in the intervening eleven months.
The August decline in new orders amounted to $1.1 billion,
and was about equally divided among steel, machinery and equipment,
and defense products. New orders for steel were the lowest since
January and the steel order backlog declined moderately. The decline
in new orders for machinery and equipment followed a bulge in July;
the August level was only a little below the second quarter average
and unfilled orders continued to rise -- although at a much slower pace
than in other recent months. Large monthly fluctuations are fairly
typical of new orders for defense products, and such orders were at
sharply advanced levels in June and July.
New orders received by the auto industry (roughly equal to
shipments), were about unchanged in August following a sharp decline
between May and July.
Inventory anticipations of manufacturers. According to the
Commerce August survey, manufacturers anticipate that their inventory
accumulation in the third quarter will about equal the high second quarter
rate. The book value increase in the third quarter is expected to total
$2.4 billion; in July alone -- the latest month for which actual figures

II -12
are available -- accumulation totaled nearly $1 billion; realization of
the anticipated figure for the quarter would require a significant drop
in the rate of accumulation in August and September.
For the fourth quarter, manufacturers anticipate a halving
of the third quarter increase -- to only $1.2 billion -- mainly because
of an expected abrupt drop in the rate of accumulation by durable goods
manufacturers who have been accounting for the bulk of the recent large
increases in inventories. Along with the lower rate of inventory
accumulation, durable goods manufacturers are expecting a further
speed-up in their sales gains -- fron less then 1 per cent in the
second quarter, to 2-1/2 in the third and to 3-1/2 in the fourth
quarter.
These inventory surveys have shown a large downward bias in
the quarterly anticipations over the past year. Thus, from the second
quarter 1965 to the second quarter 1966, the first anticipations (i.e.,
the equivalent of the August survey finding for the fourth quarter)
understated the actual reported rate of accumulation on average by $1
billion -- or over 50 per cent per quarter -- and the second
anticipations showed surprisingly small improvements over the first
ones. While little confidence can be placed in the size of the drop
in the rate of projected accumulation for the fourth quarter, these
anticipations may well be pointing in the right direction and the

II -13
rate of inventory accumulation by manufacturers may have reached a
peak in July and now be receding.
Labor market. Increasing employment and overtime work,
particularly in automobile factories, and further expansion in the armed
forces are adding to pressure on labor resources.
A substantial increase in over-all nonfarm employment is
expected in September. Unemployment claims which appeared to level off
during the summer months declined again in September after seasonal
adjustment. In mid-September, the number of weeks claimed under State
programs was 25 per cent below a year ago and at the lowest level
for this time of the year since 1952. The ratio of claims to covered
employment -- estimated at 2.2 per cent in September -- was the lowest
for the month since World War II.
Another indication of strong demand for manpower has been the
steady decline in the number of geographical areas classified as having
substantial labor surpluses. The number of areas with unemployment rates
of 6 per cent or more dropped from 35 in July 1964, to 19 in July
1965 to only 10 this July.

II -14
Recent rapid expansion in employment has removed from the
surplus group a number of areas which have suffered from heavy unemploy-
ment for many years, such as Lawrence-Haverhill, Massachusetts; Scranton
and Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania; Charleston, West Virginia and San
Diego, California. Remaining in the 6 per cent or more unemployment
category were 3 areas in California; 3 in Massachusetts; one in
Pennsylvania; one in New Jersey and 2 in Puerto Rico. At the same time,
the number of areas with 3 per cent or less unemployment rates has
increased substantially. About 2 out of 5 areas were in this low
unemployment group in August.
Wages. Increases in average hourly earnings in manufacturing
over a year ago are substantially greater than in the preceding year.
The upward drift is accounted for in part by larger negotiated settle-
ments and by escalator clauses included in the contracts of some major
industries. Recent stability in the workweek, however has tended to
limit further increases in take-home pay from this source.

II -15
In August hourly earnings in manufacturing were 10 cents or
almost 4 per cent above a year ago -- the same rate of increase as in
the two previous months. This rate of increase is above the approximately
3 per cent rise in productivity now indicated for manufacturing. Rising
consumer prices, a pattern of 4-5 per cent wage increases in new con-
tracts and an unusual bunching of deferred wage increases in September
and October suggest further increases in hourly earnings in the coming
months.
Wage increases have been in the 4-5 per cent range in most
nonmanufacturing industries with even larger increases reported in the
low-wage service activities. Wages rose earlier in these industries
than in manufacturing over the past year and generally increases were
above those reported from 1964 to 1965. The rapid advances in
trade and service wages contributed significantly to upward pressures
on the consumer price index. Both the direct and indirect effects of
the expansion in coverage in these industries under the new minimum
wage law, effective next February, will probably add to upward momentum
in wages in these sectors and continue to influence price movements.
Changes in the minimum wage law. Recent revisions of the
Fair Labor Standards Act will become effective February 1, 1967. It
is estimated that the direct impact will be to raise wages and salaries
by $1 billion, annual rates in the first quarter of 1967. In addition,
there will be a substantial secondary impact as other wages tend to
adjust upward to maintain traditional wage differentials.

II -16
In addition to lifting the minimum wage from the current $1.25
per hour to $1.40 in February 1967 and $1.60 in February 1968 for
workers now covered, the new amendment provides for an extension of
coverage to an additional 8 million workers mainly in trade, services,
and on farms. The minimum for newly-covered nonfarm workers will
start at $1.00 per hour in February 1967 and will increase by 15 cents
a year until a $1.60 an hour is reached in February 1971. For farm
workers the $1.00 minimum goes up in two annual steps to $1.30 by
February 1969.
Minimum wage protection is extended for the first time to
1.5 million service workers in hospitals and educational institutions;
to 700,000 workers in restaurants, hotels and motels; to 500,000
laundry workers; and to some 700,000 Federal government wage board and
other workers previously specifically exempted. In these newly-covered
industries, the largest concentration of workers with hourly earnings
of less than $1.00 is in hospitals and educational institutions and on
farms.
The amendments also lower or eliminate previous annual volume
of sales criteria for coverage. In retail trade, coverage is increased
by lowering the annual volume of sales test from $1 million, set in the
1961 amendments to $500,000 on February 1, 1967 and to $250,000 on
February 1, 1969. In construction, the $350,000 annual sales volume
criterion is eliminated.

II -17
Farm production prospects. Surveys of crop and pig pro-
duction prospects reported in September were generally reassuring from
the standpoint of supply outlook. Marked improvement in crop yields
during August raised the September 1 index of crop production 3 points
from the August 1 forecast to 112 per cent of the 1957-59 average. The
crop index was still 4 per cent below the record output of last year,
but about half of the difference resulted from the planned cut-back in
cotton, which is in surplus supply.
Increases in crop prospects during August were sharpest in
soybeans and feed grains, although food grains, cotton, tobacco, peanuts,
and sugar crops also improved. Future prices of most of the traded
commodities except cotton weakened in response to news of improved crop
prospects. The most pronounced price declines were soybeans and grains.
The pig crop survey showed that numbers are expanding, al-
though not quite so rapidly as the June survey had indicated, and that
increasing slaughter can be expected through the summer of 1967.
Wholesale prices. The wholesale price index for mid-August
showed a further rise, as expected, but one not so large as in July --
.4 per cent compared with .7 per cent. Information through September
20 suggests no further increase in the total index. Over the past year,
the wholesale index has risen by about 3-3/4 per cent; prices of food-
stuffs have increased 8 per cent, and although they have an importance
in the index of only a fourth, foodstuffs have contributed about half
the rise in the total index; industrial commodities have increased somewhat
more than 2 per cent over the year.

II -18
From mid-July to mid-August, average prices of industrial
commodities were unchanged, apart from the effect of a decrease of about
25 per cent in raw cotton which resulted mainly from a change in the
form of the Federal program. Prices of some sensitive commodities --
copper scrap, hides, lumber, and plywood -- declined but the other or
"sluggish" group of industrial materials continued to rise at about the
same pace as earlier in the year, mainly as a result of increases for
steel sheet and strip and for fuels. Wholesale prices of both consumer
finished products and producers' equipment edged up only slightly
further.
Since mid-August, however, price increases have been announced
for a number of products, suggesting resumption of the rise in the
industrial average, although some of the increases are not scheduled to
take effect until October 1. Increases have been announced for many
consumer durable goods -- including furniture, color television sets,
room air-conditioning units, and small appliances. In addition prices
for some tractors have been raised by one manufacturer and the increase
announced earlier for trucks has been followed by additional producers.
Following many weeks of speculation about the amount of the
likely increases in autos, the price tags have now been announced for
the 1967 auto models that go on sale this week. Ford, the first to make
an announcement, appraised its changes as being slightly greater than
accounted for by the new safety features and other changes in specifi-
cations, but General Motors followed with smaller increases in price
tags which it appraised as being slightly less than accounted for

II -19
by safety and other features. Ford then scaled down its increases in
price tags, but about half the revision was attributable to changing
the status of some equipment items from "standard" back to "optional."
The Bureau of Labor Statistics technicians have the task of determining
what the real change in prices is, after taking into consideration the
addition of some safety features and other changes in specifications,
and the Bureau is having engineering evaluations made. At this point,
one may guess that the BLS index for autos after adjustment for quality
change will show little if any increase.
While prices of industrial commodities have resumed their
rise in recent weeks, those of foodstuffs have declined somewhat. Prices
of livestock have fallen about 5 per cent since mid-August in response
to seasonal expansion in marketings. So far in September, hog marketings
appear to be little larger than a year ago although a large year-over-
year expansion is expected this autumn.
Consumer prices. The consumer price index showed another large
rise -- .4 per cent -- in August, a month in which the balance of seasonal
influences usually produce stability or a small decrease. The list
of increases was long; the number of decreases was small and they were
chiefly of a seasonal variety. The rise from a year earlier amounted
to 3.5 per cent.
Continuing increases in food prices accounted for about three-
fourths of the August rise in the total index. The increase of 1.5 per
cent in food purchased for home consumption was both large and contrary
to the usual seasonal change. Increases were sizable for eggs, for bread

II -20
and some other bakery products, and for milk, butter and other dairy
products. Retail prices of meats continued to change little.
The increase of .3 per cent in services in August was slightly
below the monthly average over the past year. The rise in medical
services, however, remained very rapid.
The index for nonfood commodities changed little in August.
New cars declined and used cars increased, both more than seasonally.
Apart from autos, nonfood commodities rose on a seasonally adjusted
basis as increases in furniture and floor coverings were about balanced
by seasonal reductions in textile housefurnishings.
In commenting on price changes from August 1965 to August 1966,
BLS noted that mortgage interest rates rose by more than 8 per cent and
hospital rates by 9 per cent, that auto insurance, public transportation,
professional medical fees, barber and beauty shop services, and taxes,
insurance, and upkeep on owned homes increased by amounts between 4
and 6 per cent. Aside from foods and services, the largest increases
were for shoes, newspapers, cigarettes, and furniture.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL SITUATION
Bank credit. Growth in bank credit over the past two months
has come to an abrupt halt. As measured on a daily average basis
by the bank credit proxy, there was no net change over the August-
September period, after allowing for increased borrowing from foreign
branches. Over the first three weeks of September, loans and investments
at city banks rose $810 million, only a third to a fourth as much as
in the comparable periods of other recent years. This recent slackening
in credit expansion contrasts sharply with developments over the first
seven months of the year, when the credit proxy (adjusted for borrowings
from foreign branches) rose at an annual rate of 8.2 per cent and the end-
of-month credit series at a 9 per cent rate.
The recent smaller bank credit growth has been influenced
by lessened bank financial intermediation, a run-down in U.S. Govern-
ment deposits, and a reduction in the rate of growth in bank loans.
Tightening of bank lending terms and conditions as banks came under
increasing pressure presumably contributed to the slackened loan growth;
in August, it also appeared to reflect some backwash of the earlier tax
speed-up and, thus far in September, perhaps a less-than-expected
resurgence of business loan demands.
So far this month, business loans at city banks have increased
$1.2 billion, about $200 million more than in the comparable weeks
(ending September 22) last year. However, this year's increase included

III -2
a substantial amount of term loans to Consolidated Coal to facilitate
its absorption by Continential Oil. In the absence of this borrowing,
the increases for the two years would not havediffered greatly. On
the other hand, relative to the volume of corporate tax payments, which
were about $1 billion less this September than last, business borrowing
at banks this year was heavier than a year ago. While corporate income
tax payments were about $400 million larger this year than last, owing
mainly to acceleration, withholding tax payments were much lower because
September payments this year were to be made in two instalments early
and late in the month rather than concentrated entirely at midmonth
as in former years.
Security loans at weekly reporting banks showed a substantial
contraseasonal decline over the first three weeks of September. One
factor contributing to this weakness was the substantial purchase of
money market paper at midmonth by some large business corporations and
local governmental bodies. Government security dealers were able to
reduce their bill inventories over the tax week more than usual, with
some of the demand for bills presumably representing funds transferred
out of CD's. Finance company loans thus far in September have increased
about the same as a year ago.
Reflecting their generally tight positions, weekly reporting
banks reduced their holdings of Treasury issues by over $800 million in
the first three weeks of September in contrast with increases in these
holdings in other recent years. The September decline included large
reductions in tax bills at banks outside of New York City. New York

III 3
City banks, in contrast, having built up their bill holdings for
several weeks prior to the tax week in anticipation of both large loan
demands and CD run-offs, liquidated only about $100 million of bills
over the tax week. Holdings of "other" securities at weekly reporting
banks rose less than in most other recent years, as might have been
expected.
Bank deposits. All weekly reporting banks lost almost $900
million of negotiable CD's from-mid-August to September 14, as yields on
these instruments became increasingly less attractive than money market
assets. Most of this decline was centered in New York City banks,
who lost $630 million, with further losses at these banks running about
$100 million over the tax week. If CD losses for the rest of September
are similar to those experienced so far during this month, New York
City banks are likely to lose one-third of their $2.2 billion of
September maturities this month, and other weekly reporters will lose
about one-fifth of their scheduled maturities of $3.1 billion. This
implies a September reduction in negotiable CD's of about $1.4
billion, compared to less than $300 million for the same month last year.
This month's decline in negotiable CD's, however, was $500
million less than it might have been, because of the Continental Oil-
Consolidated Coal merger, which resulted in purchases of CD's by
Consolidated Coal in that amount. These CD's -- $380 million placed in
New York -- were acquired during the tax week and have a 33-day maturity.
CD's were apparently the vehicle used for investing the funds borrowed

III -4
to facilitate the merger because of the need for a specific
maturity to meet the liquidating dividend. The resultant smaller
decline in New York City bank CD's, therefore, provided these banks with
only temporary comfort because of the near certainty of the complete
run-off of these Consolidated Coal CD's next month.
The large CD run-offs account for most of the projected
sharp decline in time and savings deposit inflows to all banks in
September. However, it is also apparent that bank inflows of other time
deposits have moderated from the pace earlier this year, as shown in the
table. The inflow of time deposits other than CD's at weekly reporting
banks this year in mid-September was only about half again as large
as last year, whereas through the first 8 months of 1966 the increase
was more than 2-1/2 times that for the comparable period last year.
Newly revised data now indicate that September inflows of time and savings
deposits will be at a 4 per cent annual rate compared to 15 per cent in
July and 11 per cent in August.
On the basis of the revised seasonal factors, Treasury deposits
at banks during September, as in August, show a large seasonally
adjusted decline -- $1.4 billion in August and $0.7 billion in
September -- as Government expenditures continue to increase and

III -5
early heavy agency financing is terminated. These recent declines
provided liquidity to the public partly in the form of funds
that were used to make loan repayments and partly in the form of
a sharp increase in the money stock in September. The expected
$1.3 billion September increase in the money stock would bring
the seasonally adjusted annual rate of increase for the year to date
to 2.9 per cent.

III -6
U. S. Government securities market. Prices of Treasury notes
and bonds have fluctuated sharply since mid-September, but on balance
have changed relatively little. The market has been very sensitive to
news or rumors, particularly concerning taxes, the war in Vietnam, and
the Treasury's huge financing needs over the rest of the year. In this
environment, the market has been dominated by trading among professionals,
with investor activity remaining relatively light.

inventories to relatively low levels, and a more comfortable tone in
the central money market has facilitated the financing of the lighter

from a wide range of investors and may reflect in part the reinvestment
of proceeds from maturing CD's. Bill yields on all but the shortest
maturities have been more attractive than yields on CD's recently.
In other short-term markets, most yields have changed little
since late August, although secondary market yields on CD's and short-
term Agency issues have advanced somewhat, as the table shows.

Federal Agency securities. Sales of new Agency issues since
early September have involved a net paydown of over $300 million in the
amount of such securities sold to private investors, as the table below
shows. Agencies nevertheless have raised over $200 million, net, of
new money in this period through sales of portions of the new issues
directly to Government Trust Accounts. These direct sales, which
actually were initiated in early August, represent one aspect of the
President's five point program to minimize cash borrowings in the market
by Federal Agencies over the balance of the calendar year. One result
has been an excellent market reception accorded recent new issues.

Treasury finance. On September 21 the Treasury announced a
$1.4 billion auction of 9 and 12 month bills to replace $1.0 billion of
maturing 1-year bills. The auction -- comprised of $500 million reopened
9-month bills and $900 million new 1-year bills -- initiates a new

III -9
financing cycle which is expected to raise $400 million of cash each
month until next June.
The Treasury also indicated that its next major cash borrowing
is expected to be announced in early October with the payment date after
mid-October. The Treasury may raise perhaps $3.0 billion to $3.5 billion
in this financing which will probably involve tax bills. Over the
balance of the calendar year, many market observers expect the Treasury
to raise a total of around $8.0 billion, a figure derived from a recent
statement made to the press by President Johnson. On this assumption,
the Treasury would be raising some $11.0 billion over the second half of
1966, a figure that was last approached, but not equalled, in the second
half of 1959, as the table indicates.

Corporate and municipal bond markets. Yields on new and
recently offered corporate bonds have fluctuated since Labor Day 20 to
25 basis points below their highs of late August. Yields on municipal
bonds also dropped back from their late August highs by roughly 15 to 20
basis points, but turned up slightly on balance after mid-month. Both
the sharp general rise of bond yields in late August and the sharp sub-
sequent reversal in early September strongly reflected changing market
judgments about the future availability of loan funds and the strength
of expected demands. Recently, with the outlook for both still uncertain,
yields have showed a high degree of sensitivity to renewed press specula-
tion about a post-election tax increase and a shift in the Vietnam
situation.

With respect to current demands for funds, corporate
flotations of publicly-offered bonds appear to be smaller in September
than had been previously estimated, amounting to approximately $750
million or only 60 per cent of the record August total. The August
total had been enlarged mostly because offerings of several large
issuers had bunched together and partly because borrowers were tending
to accelerate planned offerings in order to get ahead of feared credit
availability crisis.
The smaller than estimated September total reflects both a
moderate volume of postponements and the absence of further significant
additions to the calendar after the crisis atmosphere of late August
had colored. While the aggregate volume of public issues estimated for
September exceeds that for September 1965 by about $90 million, the
volume of all corporate financing -- including private placements -- is
expected to fall somewhat below a year ago. More than half of the
public bond offerings are convertibles.
Looking ahead, the forward calendar of scheduled corporate
offerings as yet shows little evidence of any significant further build-
up of offerings stemming from the intensified squeeze on business loans
at banks. Bond offerings already listed for October amount to $500
million and total public offerings for the month are now estimated at
about $575 million. While substantially below August and September,
$575 million would still be a relatively large figure for October.

e/ Estimate.
In the municipal market, underwriters apparently over-
estimated the significance of the early September down-turn in yields,
and aggressive pricing of new issues produced a rather poor investor
response. Advertised inventories rose from about $250 million to $375
million in less than a week. At the same time, continued pressure on
short-term market yields resulted in the postponement of more than $200
million of short-term municipal notes. New issues of longer maturity
offered at the higher yields established last week have been accorded a
good investor reception, however, as evidenced by several recent sell-
outs, including the previously postponed $179 million New Jersey Turnpike
issue which carried a 4.75 per cent yield.
The expected September volume of municipal issues -- at
$975 million -- is above earlier estimates due to late additions to the
calendar but it is still below a year ago. Likewise, the calendar for

III -13
October, at about $775 million, is expected to fall short of last year.
In September, however, some issues postponed in August were induced back
into the market following the down-turn of yields, and any further yield
decline in the period ahead would be likely to encourage other additions
to the calendar.

Stock market. After hitting a two-year low at the end of
August, common stock prices have since turned up on balance, with
Standard and Poor's composite index showing a net advance of nearly
5 per cent. This up-turn was more than accounted for, however, by the
sharp rally -- the largest for any week in three years -- which developed
following announcement of the President's new program of fiscal actions.
Later, as investors reappraised the likely near-term impact of such
measures on economic activity and monetary policy, about two-thirds of
the gain was erased. Since then stock prices have fluctuated uncertainly
with shifting appraisals of the prospects for peace in Vietnam and for
a post-election increase in Federal income taxes.

III -14
Trading volume has likewise shown considerable variation
since late August, generally rising and falling with stock prices.
Reports indicate that institutional investors have been returning to
the stock market, acquiring blue chip stocks and largely accounting for
a moderate pick-up of activity in utilities and other investment grade
issues.
During August, when stock prices were still declining to
their two-year lows, the volume of credit used by investors contracted
significantly further. Customers' net debit balances which had already
declined $103 million in July were down another $56 million in August,
and margin credit as measured by the New York Stock Exchange margin
panel dropped $163 million in August. On the other hand, because market
values of stocks shrank faster than debt was repaid, the ratio of net
debit balances to market values of listed shares rose to 1.23 per cent
in August from 1.15 per cent in July and 1.02 per cent at the beginning
of 1966.
Mortgage market development. Interest rates on mortgages
rose substantially further during August, reflecting the intense general
pressures then prevailing in capital markets. Secondary market yields
for 5-3/4 per cent, 30-year FHA-insured mortgages advanced 7 basis points
to a new high of 6.58 per cent. This was 1-1/8 percentage point higher
than a year earlier when mortgage markets were still relatively easy and
a possible shift in underlying conditions was just beginning to be felt.
Contract rates for conventional first mortgages also rose
further in August, to 6.55 per cent on loans for new homes and 6.65 per

III -15
cent on existing homes. While its year-to-year increase in such rates
was also large -- 3/4 of a percentage point -- it was not so large as
the advance in FHA secondary market yields.
The sharp upward adjustment in mortgage rates over the past
year has been associated with tightening in loan-to-price ratios and in
maturities, particularly for loans on existing houses. Moreover, as in
other recent years, purchase prices of both new and existing homes have
continued to advance and, even with some downward adjustment in loan-to-
price ratios, average loan amounts have continued to rise.

Savings flows. Savings and loan associations and mutual
savings banks continued to experience reduced rates of growth in August
compared to previous years, according to preliminary figures. S & L's
were again the most severely affected with a net increase of $180 million
in savings capital two-thirds below that of a year ago. The $160 million
net inflow at mutual savings banks was one-fourth smaller than in August
1965.

Combining these net changes in savings at the S & L's
and mutuals with changes in time and savings deposits (other than
negotiable CD's) at commercial banks, the over-all flow to depositary-
type intermediaries shows a larger year-to-year short-fall in August
than in earlier months of the year -- due chiefly to the less favorable
August experience at banks. Thus, the net inflow to all types of
institutions was 44 per cent less than in August 1965, whereas that for
the first eight months was 32 per cent less than a year earlier. While
the relative disparity between types of institutions in their ability to
secure savings was still substantial in August, as the table shows,
commercial bank dominance in securing both current savings and savings
transferred from other types of institutions apparently diminished some-
what even before the announcement of new maximum rate ceilings.

Last week's general roll-back of maximum permissible rates
payable on consumer-type time deposits at commercial banks is likely to
enhance the competitive position of S & L's and mutuals vis a vis banks
in the key geographic areas where competition between depositary-type
institutions has caused the sharpest increase in savings rates. In
particular, the medium and small sized commercial banks in California
and New York City, which have been competing most aggressively for con-
sumer savings by offering smaller denomination certificates at the
maximum 5-1/2 per cent rate, are likely to be seriously disadvantaged.
More generally, the California S & L's have an advantage relative to
banks in attempting to hold existing accounts, because they can continue
to offer a 5-3/4 per cent rate on existing minimum-term bonus accounts

III -18
whereas the banks must roll-back rates to 5 per cent on all accounts
of less than $100,000. Also, the California S & L's can maintain their
5-1/4 per cent passbook rate on new accounts, which gives them a 1/4 of
a percentage point spread above the peak rate payable at area banks.
Similarly, in New York City mutual savings banks can continue to pay
a maximum of 5 per cent on their passbook accounts, whereas their bank
competitors have had to give up the 1/4 to 1/2 per cent spread advantage
which some institutions in the area had been maintaining on certificates.
Reflecting the improved competitive positions of S & L's and
mutuals under the new rate ceilings, spokesmen for both industries have
reacted favorably to the changes. However, considerable uneasiness still
prevails about prospective competition from market rates during the
October quarterly reinvestment period.

U.S. balance of payments. There continues to be a marked
divergence between the two customary measures of the payments position.
On the liquidity basis before seasonal adjustment, the first three
weeks of September show another deficit, although at a rate sub-
stantially below the figures for July ($500 million) and August
($330 million), even after allowance for the favorable effect of a
French debt prepayment of $70 million. On the other hand, on official
settlements there was a surplus of almost $300 million in the three
weeks of September, following smaller surpluses in July and August.
For the third quarter (through late September) the deficit
on the liquidity basis after seasonal adjustment was about $500 mil-
lion, whereas on official settlements there was a surplus of close to
$1 billion, seasonally adjusted. The difference between these two
measures is accounted for by an increase of nearly $1-1/2 billion in
U.S. liabilities to commercial banks abroad, almost entirely
liabilities of a few member banks to their foreign branches.

For the year 1966 (through September 21) U.S. liabilities
to foreign branches have risen about $2-1/4 billion, while U.S. lia-
bilities to other foreign banks on balance have shown little change.
Thus, broadly speaking, the supplies of dollars which the foreign
branches have attracted and left at the disposal of their head offices
have come not from reductions of dollar holdings in the United States
by other foreign banks, but from reductions in holdings of foreign
monetary authorities and from additions to total foreign dollar holdings
arising from the U.S. payments deficit. Private foreigners have pur-
chased dollars, or refrained from converting into their own currencies
dollars they have received.
The deficit on the liquidity basis in the third quarter
(through late September) appeared to be in the range of $2 to $2-1/2
billion at a seasonally adjusted annual rate. This estimate is a little
below the second-quarter rate, adjusted to exclude the effects of shifts
from liquid to nonliquid assets, which were very large in the second
quarter and negligible in the third. Information that might account
for this modest improvement is not yet at hand. The trade balance in
July-August deteriorated from the already low second-quarter rate, while
the shift from an outflow to a reflow of bank credit was partly offset
by increased new security issues.
The trade balance in July-August was at a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of less than $3 billion, compared to almost $3-1/2 billion
in the second quarter and to $4-1/2 billion in the first quarter. Exports
in August were unchanged from July, at an annual rate of slightly more

IV -3
than $29 billion, up more than 2 per cent from the second quarter.
Although imports in August eased from the extraordinarily high July
level, they averaged $26-1/4 billion at an annual rate for July-August,
up 5 per cent from the second quarter. The growth in exports in
recent months has been mainly to the primary producing countries (see
chart). Among industrial countries, Japan and Canada have continued
to increase their purchases from the United States, but these gains
have been offset by declines in purchases by Europe.
Total bank-reported claims on foreigners declined $260
million in July and August combined, while those bank claims reported
under the VFCR fell $210 million. These reflows were larger than the
customary seasonal ones, and appear to confirm that the second-quarter
outflows were temporary. Long-term loan commitments to foreigners in
July-August were less than $50 million a month, apart from extension
of the maturity of a large loan that already had several years before
maturity. This rate of commitment is down one-third from the first
half of the year, and only half of the rate in 1965 (post VFCR).
Foreign trade of other industrial countries. The leveling-
off in U.S. non-military exports from late 1965 through May of this
year resulted in part from parallel slackening in the growth of Conti-
nental European and Canadian total imports. In European Economic Com-
munity countries, according to the EEC Commission's economists, stocks
of imported materials were being built up rapidly last year but this
buildup came more or less to a halt in most of the member countries in
the first half of 1966. Demand for food imports also moderated in view

IV -4
of gains in Community agricultural production and prospects. (An
additional factor in the slackening of import growth was a reduction
in German military imports, but in so far as corresponding U.S. exports
are paid for through the Defense Department they are excluded from U.S.
"non-military exports.")
Increases in many industrial countries' imports -- including
those of the United States and Canada as well as of the EEC countries --
had been unusually rapid between the second and fourth quarters of 1965
as the table on page IV-5 shows. In the next interval of seven or eight
months, from 1965 Q-4 to mid-1966, increases in imports were in some
cases much slower. The change in pace was quite out of proportion to
the changes in rate of expansion of industrial output that were occurring.
In some of these countries output gains diminished, but in others in-
dustrial production rose more rapidly in the second period than in the
first. It is evident that industrial production indexes are not always
sensitive indicators of import demand. This is illustrated by the follow-
ing tabulation referring to total EEC industrial production and imports.

investment demand was easing -- and partly because of resource limita-
tions, German industrial output had changed little during most of 1965,
while imports were rising rapidly. In the first quarter of 1966 both
industrial production and imports rose somewhat. Since then, with
domestic production stable, imports have fallen off.
In three of the countries covered in the table on page IV-5,
United Kingdom, Japan and Sweden, both imports and industrial production
were nearly stable during a considerable part of 1965. In the United
Kingdom, imports jumped to a higher level early this year, but since
the first quarter British imports have been virtually stable, apart
from fluctuations due to the May-June shipping strike. The increase in
British imports at the beginning of 1966 was mainly in finished manu-
factures and semi-manufactures, rather than in basic materials or foods.
In Japan, rapid domestic expansion began again late last year. The up-
turn in demand led to a sharp step-up in Japanese imports early this
year and, more recently, to a further increase in imports in August.
In Sweden, too, there were upturns in both domestic production and im-
ports this year.
In contrast to the wide variation in import patterns, exports
of industrial countries have shown a considerable degree of similarity
in rate and time of growth since the spring of 1965. See the table on
page IV-7. At mid-1966, exports of most of these countries were run-
ning about 12 to 15 per cent higher than in the second quarter of 1965.
(For the United States this comparison is based on 1965-Q2 figures
adjusted down to remove the post-strike distortion; the unadjusted data

IV -7
show a somewhat smaller increase.) Italian exports have risen even
more rapidly than the general average. British exports moved in line
with others until this spring, but the May-June seamen's strike cut
June exports drastically.
Export increases since the latter part of 1965 have been
particularly rapid for Japan and Italy, countries in which there is
now considerable capacity for output expansion. In both cases export
growth had leveled off during 1965; also, in Japan, a maritime strike
had cut down December exports.
