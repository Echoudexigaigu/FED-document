SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK
Outlook for GNP
Department of Commerce preliminary figures show that GNP
increased at a faster pace in the third quarter -- rising nearly $14
billion as compared with $11 billion in the second. Larger increases
in defense outlays, business fixed investment, and consumer spending
contributed to the step-up. Retarding influences in the quarter were
declines in residential construction and the rate of inventory accumu-
lation. Sectoral changes -- and the rise in total GNP -- in the fourth
quarter are expected to be broadly similar to those in the third quarter.
With rising prices absorbing a large proportion of the
increase in consumption expenditures since the beginning of the year,
the rise in consumers' real takings has slackened, and output of con-
sumer goods has shown only a small rise since early spring. The sharp
step-up in consumer spending in the third quarter came from recovery
in durable goods purchases, but only to the first quarter rate. In
the current quarter, spending for durable goods is expected to increase
only moderately further, with higher prices for autos a factor in the
rise. More of the increase in total consumer spending now projected
to accompany the large expected rise in income is likely to result from
stepped-up purchases of nondurable goods and services, with higher
prices also contributing significantly to the increase in current dollar
volume.

I -2
Future growth in consumer incomes and spending will depend
to an important degree on how strong an upward thrust is maintained in
defense and business equipment sectors. Recent months have seen a
steady escalation of defense spending estimates for the last half of this
year. The third quarter increase in defense purchases of goods and
services now stands (in the preliminary Commerce GNP figures) at $4.2
billion (as against $2.5 billion in the second quarter), and a further
large rise in defense spending is projected for the fourth quarter.
Orders for defense equipment spurted sharply in September to a new
record level.
Since the beginning of the year, business construction has
been easing off -- mainly in the commercial sector -- and an unusually
large rise in equipment purchases has accounted for the entire increase
in business fixed investment. New orders, the order backlog, and out-
put continued to rise for machinery and equipment through September,
and equipment outlays are expected to rise further in the current quarter.
Only a moderate further slowing in the rate of nonfarm business
inventory accumulation is now being projected for the current quarter,
in part because of the sustained growth in inventory requirements in
the defense and business equipment industries. In consumer goods
lines the rate of inventory accumulation appears to have tended down-
ward since midyear.
Looking beyond the fourth quarter, it seems reasonable that
continued monetary restraint, suspension of the investment tax credit
and accelerated amortization, and some moderation of capacity pressures

I-3
in consumer goods industries will probably result in reduction in over-
all growth in business fixed investment. Moreover, further downward
pressures on the pace of inventory accumulation would tend to follow
from any slackening of the rate of increase in activity in equipment
industries, as well as from the general influence of restrictive monetary
policy. But in the absence of any basis for forecasting the pace of
defense spending or of additional fiscal restraints, it has not seemed
fruitful to incorporate in the Green Book any quantitative projections
of total GNP going into 1967.
Resource use and prices
Utilization of manufacturing capacity remained quite high in
the third quarter and the unemployment rate was quite low. Nevertheless,
expansion in industrial output and employment has slackened.
Levels of unfilled orders suggest that the deceleration of
the rise in output in defense and business equipment industries --
to an annual rate of 14 per cent in the third quarter from about 20
per cent during the preceding 12 months -- was caused largely by
limitations of plant or labor resources. For consumer goods, the virtual
leveling in output is attributable, in part, to slackening in demands for
autos last spring and summer and to a reduction in demand for appliances
and other home goods associated with the decline in home building.
Partly as a result of crosscurrents in output of final products,
pressures among materials-producing industries have varied. Supplies of
major nonferrous metals and some types of textiles have remained short

I -4
and supplies of some chemicals and paper products also may not be ade-
quate to meet inventory demands as well as production requirements.
But for other paper products and chemicals (including synthetic textiles),
steel, and building materials, potential supplies are ample, and in
certain cases, inventories may have increased to or somewhat above
desired levels.
Looking ahead, output of defense and business equipment is
likely to continue to press against capacity, but auto production is
not expected to expand beyond the relatively high level to which it
is recovering in October, and output of other consumer goods and most
materials is likely to expand less rapidly than capacity. Although
there are prospects for some selective easing in pressures on plant
facilities, the expansion projected for GNP is sufficient to sustain
increases in aggregate employment in line with growth in the labor
force. The unemployment rate will remain below 4 per cent and various
skills will remain scarce, but overtime work may be reduced in selected
manufacturing industries.
Price developments, over the past year, have been dominated
by the direct impact of expanding demands on certain materials and
products, by reduction in supplies of a number of foodstuffs, and by
rising wages in service industries; labor costs per unit of output have
not generally increased by appreciable amounts in commodity-producing
industries. In recent months, however, negotiated wage increases have
tended to become larger, and with unemployment low, profits high, and

I -5
the consumer price index up considerably, demands for wage increases
are likely to remain large. At the same time, slower expansion in
industrial output is likely to be accompanied by a reduction in the rate
of gain in productivity. Rising unit labor costs, therefore, may become
a greater influence on price developments.
Banking system
Business loans by banks will apparently expand at between a
10 to 12 per cent annual rate in October. While this expansion is
greater than the 7-1/2 per cent rate of September, the increase was less
than anticipated in light of the further acceleration of corporate pay-
ments of withheld taxes in October. Taking September and October together,
business loan expansion has been at roughly one-half the pace of the
first eight months of the year.
Apparently both supply and demand factors entered into the
recent experience. Commercial banks have been forced to reduce their
over-all credit growth sharply, and this has been reflected in a
further tightening of lending standards to businesses and discourage-
ment of loan applications. But there has also apparently been some
moderation in business demand for funds at current loan costs. The
cutback in bank loans to business has not been associated with any
marked growth in security market financing. And while some business
need for funds may have been satisfied by redemptions of outstanding
negotiable CD's, at least part of funds withdrawn from CD's appears to

I-6
have been reinvested in the bill market and helps account for the recent
rapid decline in rates there.
Business loan growth over the next few weeks is not likely
to be much more rapid than in the recent past, and might even be less
so. Corporate tax liabilities will be reduced in November because of
the accelerated payments of withheld taxes in October. While loan
demands could be held down if inventory accumulation dropped more rapidly
than is now projected, in the short-run rising capital outlays should
maintain business external financing needs.
Banks may find less pressure on CD's over the next few weeks
because of the lower level of interest rates on Treasury bills, especially
on very short-term bills. With a possibly more favorable CD experience
coupled with less intense bank credit demands, banks would have less
need to liquidate securities and their borrowing demands on Reserve
Banks would be reduced.
Capital markets outlook
In corporate and municipal bond markets the estimated volume
of new financing during October and on the calendar for the
period immediately ahead has remained quite moderate, despite the
sizable general roll-back of bond yields since early September and the
continued slower growth of business loans at banks. While there un-
doubtedly will be further additions to the November calendar in the
weeks immediately ahead, underwriters at the moment report fewer large
issues in the gestation stage than was the case last summer.

I -7
Offerings bf new municipal bonds are expected to continue
to run behind a year ago, as they did in the third quarter. Even
at currently reduced rates a few recent State and local government
borrowers continue to experience difficulty in covering financing needs
at acceptable interest costs. And only a few of the issues postponed
earlier in the year have as yet been brought back to market, notwith-
standing the considerable recent decline in municipal bond yields.
In the U.S. Government securities market, yields have declined
rather sharply thus far in October. The Treasury will announce its
mid-November refunding by the end of this week. It is expected that
this will involve two issues, the longer-term option maturing in
3-5 years with an attractive coupon, perhaps 5-1/4 per cent. In the
prevailing market atmosphere such an issue could generate some selling
of other securities in order to capture the higher current yield over
the life of the new offering.
While the Treasury refunding could lead to some, perhaps
temporary, upward yield adjustments, the outlook for the capital markets
as a whole does not suggest any substantial upward interest rate
movements. And in the absence of any build-up in corporate and municipal
calendars, bond yields could drift off somewhat further. Such a develop-
ment may, however, generate offerings of participation certificates by
the Federal Government.
With respect to mortgage markets, under the new maximum rate
ceilings and with market interest rates somewhat lower, savings flows

I- 8
to mutual savings banks have maintained their recent improvement in the
first half of October; savings and loan associations also appear to be
somewhat less hard pressed than earlier, although California S&L's
appear little if any better off. Funds available for mortgage lending
at life insurance companies may very well be cut back further, however,
in view of the combination of heavy prior commitments and the erosion
of available cash flows.
Balance of payments
With some abatement of tightness in U.S. money market con-
ditions, U.S. banks made only slight further net drawings in the four
weeks through October 19 on the Euro-dollar market, where the call-
money and seven-day rates remained near earlier highs. Lacking large
inflows of foreign private liquid funds such as occurred in July-
September, the U.S. balance of payments has been in deficit so
far this month on the official reserve transactions basis, as well
as on the liquidity basis.
In the absence of large accretions to Euro-dollar supplies
such as those associated with movements out of sterling last summer,
it is unlikely that inflows of foreign liquid funds through U.S. banks
will resume on the very large scale of July to mid-September. Toward
the yearend, seasonal tightness in the Euro-dollar market may produce
some return flow to Europe.
The short-term liabilities of U.S. banks to foreign holders
of Euro-dollar deposits now constitute a sizable threat overhanging

I-9
the U.S. net official reserve position. However, if a substantial
run-off of these liabilities some time in the future were to be
associated with movements of funds from the Euro-dollar market into
sterling -- either in response to covered rate differentials or for
other reasons -- the resulting addition to U.S. official reserves
could hardly be considered an unfavorable development from the U.S.
point of view -- even though U.K. repayments of central bank credits
(and eventually of IMF drawings) would tend to augment the official
dollar holdings of Continental Europe.
Data on U.S. international transactions in September show
a further shrinkage in the trade surplus, with merchandise imports
at a new high, and on the other hand further net repayments of bank
credit by foreigners. Preliminary incomplete data on settlement items
suggest the following seasonally adjusted balances for the third quarter:
a deficit under $1 billion annual rate on the liquidity basis without
special adjustment; a deficit near $2 billion annual rate if adjustment
is made for foreign debt prepayments to the United States and foreign
shifts into nominally nonliquid U.S. assets; a large surplus on
the official reserve transactions basis, amounting in the single quarter
to something between $1 and $1-1/2 billion -- so far out of line with
other periods that measurement in annual rate terms would be meaningless.
In coming months, official reserve transactions are unlikely
to show a surplus for the United States. But even if (as seems likely)

I -10
there are no further massive inflows of foreign liquid funds, the net
outflow of U.S. capital may continue to be restrained. Accordingly,
so long as U.S. bank credit remains as tight as in recent months, the
liquidity deficit (apart from special transactions) may remain nearer
a $2 billion level than the $3 billion level which was feared a few
months ago.

THE ECONOMIC PICTURE IN DETAIL
The Nonfinancial Scene
Gross National Product. Gross national product is projected
at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $759.5 billion in the fourth
quarter, up $13.5 billion from the third. This rise is about the same
as in the third quarter, when, according to the Commerce preliminary
estimates, GNP totaled $746 billion. Present estimates for the two
quarters -- and the indicated real growth rate of about 4 per cent per
year -- are little different from our projections made over the past
2 or 3 months.
The third -- and fourth -- quarter increases represent a
step-up from an $11 billion rise in the second quarter, and the step-up
comes mainly from larger increases in defense outlays, business fixed
investment and consumer spending. Part of the boost represented by
these expansive developments has been offset in total GNP by a much
larger fall-off after midyear in residential construction activity
because of the sharp curtailment of mortgage financing funds and by a
moderate decrease in the rate of inventory accumulation.
The main expansive strength in the second half year continues
to be centered in defense and business equipment sectors. New and
unfilled orders, output, and employment (including the Armed Forces)
were rising through September, and large further increases in outlays
seem assured during the current quarter. The increase in defense pur-
chases of goods and services amounted to $4.2 billion in the third

II -2
quarter, according to preliminary Commerce estimates; a similar increase
is projected for the current quarter, after allowance for inclusion in
the third quarter rise of the one-time stimulus of the Federal pay raise.
These figures represent a sharp step-up from earlier increases, and they
are having a major influence on the pace of over-all activity.
In the other area of major strength -- business equipment --
order and activity trends also remained strong through September, and
outlays are expected to rise sharply further in the current quarter.
Business outlays for producers' durable equipment have been rising since
the beginning of the year at an annual rate of 17 per cent, as compared
with a 13 per cent increase from early 1965 to early 1966. Over-all
business construction has shaded off since the first quarter, however,
as the effects of restrictive monetary policy have limited commercial
building activity, while industrial construction has remained relatively
strong. The easing off in business construction has tended to limit the
rise in total business fixed investment since early 1966 to an annual
rate of around 8 per cent, as compared with a 15 per cent increase from
early 1965 to early 1966 -- a period during which business construction
rose by a fifth. Looking beyond the next few months, selective suspen-
sion of the investment tax credit, as well as some slackening of
pressures on capacity in consumer goods lines, may well act to moderate
the growth in equipment outlays as well.
Rising prices have been absorbing a large proportion of the
increase in consumption expenditures thus far in 1966; the rise in real
consumer takings has slackened and output of consumer goods has shown

II -3
very little increase since early spring. Partly reflecting these
developments in consumer buying, increases in nonfarm employment have
tended to slow in recent months. However, wage increases have been
accelerating and supplements to current income in the form of Federal
transfer payments have been boosted since midyear (for Medicare and
other purposes) with the result that personal income is continuing to
rise rapidly. In the third quarter, despite a boost in social security
tax payments (for Medicare) and a further large rise in other personal
tax payments, disposable income increased $7.5 billion as compared with
about $5 billion in the second quarter. Another large increase in
disposable income is projected in the current quarter,
Recovery in durable goods purchases to the first quarter
level accounted for the spurt in total consumption expenditures in
third quarter, which outran the rise in disposable income and brought
the indicated saving rate to the lowest level in three years. For the
current quarter we are now projecting as large a rise in consumer spending
as in the third quarter and no change in the saving rate. The projection
assumes no change in unit (new) auto sales but larger increases than in
the third quarter for nondurable goods and services. Evidence on the
current reception of the new auto models is still uncertain, however.
The different incidence of the auto model changeover this year is
preventing accurate determination of seasonally adjusted sales levels.
Present GNP estimates incorporate only a moderate slackening
in the rate of nonfarm inventory accumulation during the last half of

II -4
year. This is in recognition in part of the probable continued growth in
inventory requirements in defense and business equipment sectors, which
last spring and summer were accounting directly for over 40 per cent
of the large accumulation of factory stocks. Moreover, the magnitude
of the change in auto stocks -- rapid accumulation of which contributed
so significantly to the second quarter bulge in business inventory
investment -- are still not firmly set. Some decline in auto stocks
is assumed after midyear.
A major question is the extent to which the very high rate
of accumulation of factory stocks in July and August may have been
"involuntary." With manufacturing shipments showing little change from
March on and with inventories rising rapidly, stock-sales ratios moved up
rather abruptly and generally, and in the consumer goods, construction
material and related sectors particularly inventories probably became
too high. In August, manufacturers of durable goods reported intentions
to make a very large downward adjustment in the rate of inventory
accumulation in the current quarter, but this was predicated in part
on an expected pronounced rise in shipments after midyear, which had
not developed through September.

Industrial production. Industrial production in September
was 158.2 per cent of the 1957-59 average, virtually unchanged from the
August level. Auto assemblies increased from the reduced August level
but production of furniture and some other consumer durable goods
declined. Output of defense, industrial, and freight and passenger
equipment increased while production of commercial equipment was un-
changed. Among materials, output of iron and steel declined further but
production of most other durable materials increased. Production
of nondurable materials, chiefly some paper, textile, and chemical
products, also declined.
Available production data, primarily for autos and steel, are
insufficient to estimate the October index. Auto assemblies, so far
this month, have advanced substantially, and this increase may account
for about .3 to .4 of one point in the total index. Output of steel
ingots, however, has declined further.
The rate of increase in industrial production slowed consider-
ably further in the third quarter from the very rapid rate in the first
quarter and somewhat lower rate in the second quarter. Among consumer
goods, auto assemblies, reacting to a drop in sales and high dealer
inventories, declined sharply in July and August but rose moderately
in September. Over-all output of household durable goods rose from
the first to the second quarter and then declined. Apparel production
reached a new high last April and has changed little since then. Out-
put of business and defense equipment increased in the third quarter,

II -7
but the August-September rise in business equipment was one of the
smallest in recent months.

Retail sales. Following sharp recovery in June from the decline
in April and May, retail sales edged up somewhat further to August but
in September and early October -- according to preliminary indications --
edged down a bit. In the first two weeks of October retail sales were
reported to be only 5 per cent above a year earlier, as compared with a
9 per cent year-over-year gain in August. However, the largest part
of this narrowing of the margin resulted from a substantial rise in
sales between August and October last year. Moreover, year-over-year
early October sales comparisons for auto dealers are somewhat ambiguous
because of model changes.1966

II -8
Sales for the third quarter as a whole were up nearly 2-1/2
per cent from the second quarter, when auto sales were sharply curtailed,
but were only 1 per cent above the first quarter. Sales of nondurable
goods stores in recent months have been about 3 per cent above the first
quarter average, while sales of durable goods have been somewhat
below the first quarter in part because of lower unit sales of new autos.
Unit sales of new domestic automobiles in the first 20 days
of October were at an annual rate of approximately 8.2 million, 5 per
cent less than the rate in the preceding month but only slightly below
a year ago. In the first 10 days sales appeared strong relative to a
year ago, reflecting the early introduction of the new models, and in
the second 10 days, sales appeared weak relative to the year-earlier
period when the last of the new 1966 models were introduced. Dealer
inventories of new cars on October 20 remained somewhat high for this
time of year and were slightly above both a month ago and a year ago.
Consumer credit. The increase in consumer instalment debt
was not as large in September as in August. On the basis of early
reports from commercial banks, the September increase (seasonally
adjusted, annual rate) is estimated to have been about $6.5 billion,
compared with $7.2 billion in August and $6.8 billion in July. This
would put the rate for the third quarter as a whole a little ahead of
the second quarter but still behind the first, and sharply lower than
last year's third quarter.

The tempo of the instalment credit expansion had picked up
in July and August along with increases in consumer spending for
autos, furniture and appliances, and other consumer durable goods.
Similarly, when retail sales edged down in September, so did consumer
credit growth.
Credit grantors have continued to pursue restrictive consumer
lending policies, according to a special System survey of consumer
loans taken three weeks ago. Problems of obtaining desired funds have
apparently affected the small finance companies the most, and credit
unions and retailers the least. The survey did not include an adequate
sample of small retailers, so it is not clear how they have fared, but
large retailers have been able to draw upon well-established lines of
credit with their banks.

II -10
Construction activity. Seasonally adjusted new construction
activity was off further in September from the peak reached last March
and was at the lowest annual rate ($72.5 billion) in more than a year.
Private residential construction accounted for all of the September
decline, but private nonresidential construction expenditures were also
down further in the third quarter as a whole. Reductions in commercial,
educational and related activity were only partially offset by a small
further increase in the already sharply advanced outlays for industrial
plants and public utilities. Public construction activity apparently
leveled off in the third quarter and was below its first quarter peak.

Developments so far suggest that the first quarter rate of
residential construction outlays probably marked the peak in this
series, and that the rate over the remainder of the year will not change
significantly. In addition to limited availability of mortgage and
other types of funds, costs of construction and financing have risen to

II -11
dampen earlier plans. And although there was an increase in seasonally
adjusted Dodge contracts for nonresidential building in September, it
followed a period of irregular decline. Moreover, suspension this
October of the 7 per cent investment tax credit and elimination of the
most accelerated types of depreciation allowances for tax purposes
(until early 1968) can be expected to have a contractive influence on
speculative types of projects not yet started. While plans for large
projects reaching architects' drawing boards are reported by Engineering
News-Record to have risen again in the third quarter of the year,
many of these plans are still at a stage at which, under the currently
altered tax conditions, construction can be postponed.
Seasonally adjusted housing starts declined in September from
a revised (upward) August rate nearly to the December 1960 recession
low. For the third quarter as a whole, the rate was 1.09 million,
more than a third below the recent peak in the first quarter of 1964.
Some tendency toward stabilization over the near-term appears likely on
the basis of depths already reached and in view of certain potentially
ameliorative legislation affecting the flow of loanable funds recently
approved by Congress. However, a further slide-off is likely in
October, possibly to below 1 million unit rate for the first time since
1946, judging by the continued downward course of seasonally adjusted
building permits in September. Although the decline in permits has
affected multifamily units and activity in the Northeast and West the
most, it has been quite pervasive, as shown in the table.

Orders for durable goods. New orders for durable goods rose
3-1/2 per cent in September, recovering most of the August decline, and
the rise in unfilled orders, which had slackened in August, speeded
up again to the high rate prevailing over the period from September 1965
to July 1966.
The September rise in both new and unfilled orders was con-
centrated in defense products. New defense orders were up a fourth,
to a new record level 5 per cent above the preceding high reached in
June. Excluding defense, total orders were about unchanged from
August, with some industries up and some others down. Orders for machinery
and equipment increased somewhat and unfilled orders rose substantially
further; new orders for steel recovered half of the large August decline.
New orders in September were somewhat below the peak reached
last March, although over that period the backlog of unfilled orders

II -14
continued to rise at a rapid pace. The decline from the March peak has
reflected mainly a fall-off in new orders for construction materials
and consumer durable goods. The increase in new orders from early 1965
to date was concentrated in the six months from September 1965 to March
1966.

Business inventories. In August, as in July, auto stocks dropped
sharply and total trade inventories were about unchanged. Thus, despite
further acceleration in the rate of accumulation in manufacturing, the
book value increase for total business inventories in August -- at an
annual rate of nearly $13 billion -- continued below the exceptionally
high second quarter rate of $15 billion. Auto stocks apparently increased
in September; thus, for the entire third quarter some rise in trade in-
ventories is expected and the over-all book value increase is likely to
be closer to the second quarter rate than indicated by the July-August
figures alone.
In the table below, July-August inventory changes are shown in
terms of some perspective. The main features of this showing are the
marked acceleration in inventory accumulation in durable goods industries
in the spring and summer and the shift in retail auto stocks from rapid
increase in the spring to marked decrease in the summer. The rate of
accumulation by nondurable goods producers and by non-auto distributors
has proceeded at a fairly steady pace.

Labor market. Nonfarm employment showed little change in
September, highlighting a moderation in the rate of employment growth
which has been evident during the past several months. But the manu-
facturing workweek continued at 41.4 hours in September, close to the
highest level since World War II and, at 64.2 million, nonfarm employment
was 3 million higher than a year earlier. The unemployment rate was
3.8 per cent in September, virtually unchanged from August's 3.9 rate.
The lack of employment growth in September reflected a number
of factors. Employment in trade, service, and Federal Government sectors

II -17
was apparently affected by the withdrawal of about 3 million youngsters
from the labor force to return to school -- about half a million greater
than seasonal. The exodus of young persons last month may also have
been a factor in the widespread but small declines in manufacturing
industries. (In contrast, when young workers were entering the labor
force in June, nonfarm employment rose by almost one-half million).
The continued decline in construction employment was the result
primarily of a further contraction of residential building, but con-
struction employment was still somewhat above a year earlier.
Only two major sectors showed significant employment growth
in September -- State and local government and transportation. The
substantial gain recorded in transportation reflected in large part
the end of the airline mechanics strike following settlement on a new
contract after mid-August.
The strength in hours of work also suggests that recent
slackening in employment growth may have reflected special factors.
Hours of work in manufacturing, contrary to expected movement when
employment demand eases, have risen almost half an hour since the
summer low. The workweek in electrical equipment, primary and
fabricated metals, and machinery all rose in September although employ-
ment leveled off or declined.
The increase in nonfarm employment in the third quarter was
considerably below the very rapid rate achieved in preceding quarters;
employment increased at an annual rate of 2.1 million in the third

II -18
quarter as compared with 4 million in the first quarter and 3.1 million
in the second quarter. The slowing in the rate of gain has been wide-
spread, but the reasons vary. In manufacturing, employment increases
in capital goods and defense-related industries appear to have slowed
partly because of shortages of skilled workers, and employers as a
result have been lengthening workweeks. On the other hand, some slowing
in textiles and apparel, curtailment of expansion in automobiles and a
decline in construction materials industries all contributed to reducing
total growth of manufacturing employment to half the average increase
of the previous two quarters. In nonmanufacturing sectors, in addition
to the continued decline in construction employment, trade and State and
local government employment showed smaller gains than earlier.

Wages and collective bargaining. Higher wage increases provided
in recent contracts and the impact of cost-of-living adjustments have
begun to show up in accelerated increases in earnings in manufacturing.
Average hourly earnings rose to $2.74 in September and were 4.2 per cent
higher than a year earlier. In the first half of this year, hourly
earnings were up 3-1/2 per cent from a year earlier and in 1965, they
had increased about 3.0 per cent.
The largest rise last month was in the transportation equipment
industry, reflecting a 10.5 cent annual improvement factor increase as
well as a further cost-of-living adjustment received by auto workers.
As a result, wages of these workers have increased by nearly 6 per cent
over the past year. Workers in farm and construction equipment industries
also have annual improvement factor clauses in their contracts and their
earnings will rise substantially in October.
The recent General Electric and Westinghouse settlements provide
for average annual wage and fringe increases (excluding possible cost-of-
living adjustments) of somewhat more than 4 per cent. The addition of
cost-of-living adjustments could boost the average increase to 5 per
cent or more a year.
The G.E. contract provides an average wage increase of 11.4 cents
an hour the first year, 9 cents an hour the second year, and 9.1 cents an
hour the third year. The escalator clause guarantees at least an
additional 3.0 cents an hour increase in wage rates in the second and
third year of the contract regardless of the rise in the cost-of-living.

II -20
However, benefits from the clause are limited to a maximum of 1-3/4 per
cent, or 5-1/4 cents, a year so that the maximum increase can be no more
than 10.5 cents over the two year escalator period. Such limitations to
price adjustments appear to be characteristic of recent contracts -- some-
thing similar was provided in the airline mechanics contract -- and they
represent an important limitation of union demands for open-end escalator
clauses such as contained in the auto contract.
The agreement also provides a ninth paid holiday, longer
vacations, improved pension, health and welfare benefits and more pay
for skilled workers.
Since growth in productivity in the electrical industry appears
to be well above the average for the economy, much of the additional wage
cost could probably be absorbed. But this settlement, coming after the
airline mechanics and other recent similar agreements, seems to have
crystallized a wage and fringe increase pattern at about 5 per cent --
well above the average productivity gains for the economy. This pattern
is likely to spread as other contracts are negotiated in coming months.
The limited escalation provided in the new contracts in a fashion
represents a favorable development, since in past periods of rising
consumer prices open-end escalator clauses tended to become fairly
widespread.
Consumer prices. The consumer price index in September
continued on its upward course, although the increase of 0.3 per cent
was only slightly more than seasonal. The net increase in commodities
was only of about seasonal proportions; it resulted from decreases in

II -21
foods and in new and used cars that were larger than seasonal and
increases in apparel and other nondurables that were also larger than
seasonal. The rise in services remained rapid, with the increase of
1.1 per cent for medical care extraordinarily large for one month.
Since their rise accelerated beginning in March, medical services
have increased 5 per cent, or at an annual rate of about 8 per cent.
(They have an importance in the total index that approaches 5 per cent.)
The 12-month increase in the total index remained 3.5 per cent; foods
were up 5.6 per cent, services 4.2 per cent, and commodities other than
foods only 2 per cent.
Wholesale prices. The total wholesale price index was
unchanged from mid-August to mid-September as foodstuffs showed only
a small further increase (0.4 per cent) and industrial commodities
remained stable (-0.1 per cent). Since mid-September, the total index
has declined as a result of substantial decreases in foodstuffs, especially
livestock and meats. Little evidence is available on industrial commodities
but it is likely that there has been some increase from the mid-September
level.
Continued stability in the industrial commodity index in
September reflected offsets between additional increases in machinery
and equipment and a number of metal products and further declines in
sensitive materials (hides and leather, lumber and plywood, copper scrap,
and synthetic textiles), seasonal rebates on autos in the final month of
the 1966 model year, and decreases for some household appliances. The

II -22
expectation of a rise in the industrial index in October is based on a
slowing in the decline in sensitive materials, a return to full list
prices for autos after introduction of the new models, and reports of
increases for some types of machinery and consumer durable goods.
However, a return of the industrial index to the 3.0 to 3.5 per cent
annual rates of increase in the first two quarters of this year, when
some of the sensitive materials were rising rapidly, is not likely.
Industrial commodity prices turned stable after midyear; the
anatomy of the shift from substantial rates of increase in the first
half is illustrated in the table, although no one set of time periods
is ideal for all groups. (The sensitive group, for example, reached
a peak in May when lumber was at its high.) A large part of the
acceleration in the rise that occurred at the beginning of the year
and the turn toward stability in the third quarter is accounted for
by sensitive materials. Prices of hides, lumber, and copper first rose
rapidly as a result of various interruptions to supplies as well as
strong demands in industrial countries generally, and they subsequently
declined.
A pattern of acceleration and subsequent slowing in the rise
is evident to some extent in the other groups of industrial commodities --
especially producers' equipment. For some types of machinery, specifically
agricultural and construction machinery, price increases tend to be smaller
in the second and third quarters than at other times of the year. A
major feature of the shift, however, was the behavior of electrical

II -23
equipment; this group rose more than 2 per cent in the first half of this
year, after having been virtually stable in 1965, and then increased only
0.4 per cent further in the third quarter. As yet there are no indications
as to whether the recently negotiated labor contract in the electrical
equipment industry will be followed by a renewed acceleration in prices.

Livestock supplies. Expanding livestock production is showing
up in sharply larger farm marketings in the fourth quarter. Supplies of
red meats and poultry for the quarter as a whole are expected to average
from 7 to 9 per cent above a year earlier. Egg supplies are rising too,ere

II -24
but milk production continues under a year ago. Reported increases in
the pig crop indicate that hog slaughter rates 7 to 10 per cent above
those a year earlier may continue throughout 1967. Feedlot operators
are also expanding operations and on the first of October they had
8 per cent more cattle on feed than a year earlier. Fourth quarter
marketings of fed cattle will be up 7 per cent from last year's high
level, if feedlot operators carry out their intentions. Next year,
total market supplies of beef may level off as cattlement begin to
withhold cows and calves for herd building.
1967 grain crops. With the announcement on October 17 of
the terms of the Voluntary Feed Grain Program for the 1967 crop, the
Department of Agriculture rounded out plans for bolstering next year's
supplies of wheat and feed grains. The wheat program had been announced
earlier in the year.
The feed grain program permits farmers to expand land planted
to corn and sorghum grain by as much as 15 million acres. Prices
support payment rates will be unchanged. Rental payments on diverted
land are eliminated except on small farms. Favorable market prices are
expected to maintain growers' incomes.
With normal weather, it is hoped that the expanded acreage
will lift 1967 production to 175 to 180 million tons, a substantial
increase over the 158 million-ton output of 1966. Carryover stocks of
feed grains on October 1 this year amounted to 47 million tons, generally
considered a desirable level. In the marketing year just ended, feed

II -25
grains fed to livestock increased 10 per cent to 130 million tons and
exports jumped 32 per cent to a record 29 million tons to become the
biggest dollar earner among farm products shipped overseas. Further
expansion in utilization in 1966-67 is expected to draw down stocks to
25 to 30 million tons by October 1, 1967, the end of the current mar-
keting year.
The wheat acreage allotment for the 1967 crop was increased
in May and again in August, for a total increase of 17 million acres,
or 32 per cent. With favorable growing conditions, this acreage
should produce a 1.6 billion bushel crop, 300 million bushels larger
than the crop harvested this year.
Wheat stocks on July 1, 1966 were 550 million bushels, an
adequate reserve, but a further drawdown is in prospect during the
course of this year to meet overseas commercial and foreign assistance
program demands. In fact, exports are expected to be trimmed down
somewhat from the record 869 million bushels shipped in 1965-66,
largely by substituting grains in ample supply, such as grain sorghums,
for part of India's requirement under the foreign assistance program.
In the meantime, the worldwide wheat supply situation for
1966-67 has improved markedly over the relatively tight prospects that
earlier had prompted loosening our acreage controls. Both Canada and
Russia have reported record crops, and the European crops are good.
The Argentine and Australian crops, which begin to be harvested in
December, are expected to be substantially larger than last year.

II -26
The Monsoon rains which largely determine the autumn cereal output in
India have turned out to be better than last year, although they were
still only 82 per cent of normal. These developments were reflected in
substantial declines in cash and future market prices of wheat during
September and October. Despite these declines, farmers are continuing
to hold a much larger proportion of their current crop than in recent
years.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL SITUATION
Bank credit. In October, for the third month in a row, bank
credit growth appears to be relatively weak. This continuing slowdown,
coming after the very rapid expansion of the first seven months of the
year, reflects mainly CD runoffs and the associated liquidation of
Treasury securities. Total commercial bank credit, seasonally adjusted,
showed virtually no change on balance in August and September combined.
Weekly data thus far available do not indicate any renewed strength in
bank credit thus far this fall. During the three-week period ending
October 12, total credit at weekly reporting banks declined by about
$1.8 billion, a sharp contrast to the $600 million decline in the com-
parable period last year, after excluding the effects of last year's
Treasury financing.
As shown in the table below, U.S. and other security holdings
and total loans all declined at weekly reporting banks since the September
tax date. The reduction in total loans was associated mainly with a sharp
decline in loans to security dealers and slower business loan expansion.
The growth in business loans, which totaled $186 million
compared with $415 million in the corresponding period last year, was
especially small considering the large accelerated payments of withheld
taxes due in two instalments this month. During the tax week there was
a substantial runoff of CD's at large banks, and an apparently large
volume of maturing commercial paper as well as reflected in a large con-
traseasonal rise in bank loans to finance companies.

III -2
The factors accounting for the slowing in business loan
expansion are still not clear, though it is probable that business
demand for credit may be moderating somewhat from the pace of the spring
and early summer months.
The September 15 System lending practices survey provides
some partial evidence of this moderation in business demand. As compared
with the four quarterly surveys since September 1965, the most recent
survey showed that a small but increasing number of banks were experi-
encing weaker demand for loans, and a smaller number of banks had
stronger loan demands. On the whole however, the majority of survey
respondents still reported loan demands to be moderately stronger than
in the preceding quarter. The continued rapid expansion in bank loans
to machinery and transport equipment firms, associated with the capital
goods boom, is one of the areas of strong demand.
The restrictive monetary policy of the past few months, which
has helped to keep banks under pressure, presumably has been transmitted
to some potential business borrowers who in turn have reduced outlays.
For example, loans by weekly reporting banks to retailers, which have
been weak since midyear after allowing for fluctuations in dealer
financing of new car stocks, may reflect the reported efforts by retailers
to consolidate their inventories. The weakness in bank loans to the
construction industry this year, both because of the slide in home
building and since the spring, because of a softness in nonresidential
construction, also reflects the effects of a restrictive monetary policy.

III -3
On the other hand, the reduced growth in loans to food processors and
commodity dealers since midyear does not appear to be related signif-
icantly to monetary policy, but rather appears to be mostly associated
with farmers' holding on to their crops in anticipation of higher
prices.
In addition to the slower expansion of business loans, and
the decline in loans to security dealers -- whose inventories were de-
clining -- weekly reporting banks also liquidated securities as their
CD's dropped sharply. For the three weeks ending October 12, they
reduced their holdings of U.S. Government securities by $880 million
and other securities by a contraseasonal $230 million. New York City
banks, in the week ending October 19, picked up about $550 million in
U.S. Government securities, but practically all of this increase was
in the new tax anticipation bills, payable through tax and loan credits,
which these banks presumably have been disposing of very quickly. One
indication of the continued tightness of New York City banks in the
week of the new tax financing was that they also reduced their holdings
of other securities by more than $100 million. These liquidations,
especially of other securities, reflect in large part attrition in
negotiable CD's due to their noncompetitive rates.

Bank deposits. In sharp contrast to the first eight months
of the year, when time and savings deposits on a daily average basis
at commercial banks rose at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 11 per
cent, the estimated rise in September was only at a 3.0 per cent rate,
and preliminary data for October appear consistent with a projected
decline in time and savings deposits at a 2.3 per cent annual rate.
This decline is concentrated at reserve city banks, which have had large
CD runoffs. Country banks have been able to continue to add to their
time deposits at a more than 11 per cent annual rate thus far in October,
about in line with their third quarter rate of increase, although pre-
liminary data for the third week in October indicate some apparent
moderation of this rate of increase. Perhaps the closer customer

III -5
relations these banks have with their depositors, less interest
sensitivity among their customers, and fewer accessible alternative
investment outlets, help to explain their relatively better performance.
At weekly reporting banks the main source of weakness in
time deposits following the September interest crediting period and
since the change in the Q ceiling on time deposits under $100,000, has
been the inability of these banks to replace maturing CD's as shown in
the table below. This table also indicates a marked slowing in the
pace at which these banks have been able to attract time deposits other
than CD's. This slowdown presumably reflects the September rollback to
5 per cent in the maximum amount that banks can pay on these deposits,
the more attractive rates on other financial assets, and the more
moderate switching by depositors out of savings accounts into savings
certificates and savings bonds.

In September outstanding CD's of large banks declined by
$1.2 billion, with all but $100 million of this decline occurring at
banks with total deposits of $1 billion or more, where the interest
sensitivity of depositors is apparently very high. All weekly report-
ing banks lost $350 million in CD's through the two weeks ending
October 12, with New York City banks losing slightly more than half of
this amount. In the week ending October 19, New York City banks lost
an additional $475 million in CD's, of which about $380 million was
associated with the Consolidation Coal-Continental Oil merger. Of the
$5.2 billion of CD's scheduled to mature in October it is now estimated
that runoffs will total between $1.2 and $1.5 billion, though the recent
declines in the yields on short-term market assets, including Treasury
bills, should help to keep these runoffs on the low side of this
estimate. Moreover, under present rate relationships, a large portion
of the remaining CD's rolled over probably will be put in short
maturities, as they were in September. Nearly half the CD's sold in
September mature in October and 80 per cent will mature by yearend.
For New York City banks the comparable figures are roughly 70 per cent
and 93 per cent, respectively.
Because of September's large CD runoffs, a record number of
banks had declines of 10 per cent or more in their outstanding CD's
during that month. However, since CD's were not important to many of
these banks, only 5 banks had CD losses equal to more than 3 per cent
of their total deposits. Four of these banks had total deposits of
$1 billion or more, which would indicate the difficulties that some
money market banks have been having in replacing their maturing CD's.

III -7
Reflecting liquidation by banks of their securities, payment
of accelerated withholding tax payments, and the continued attraction
to the public of yields on market instruments, the private money stock
is expected to decline by $400 million in October, or at a 2.8 per cent
annual rate. With the money stock showing no growth since April, its
rise for the first 10 months of the year, will be at a 2.3 per cent
annual rate, well below the 4.1 per cent rise for the comparable period
last year.
In large part because of these CD runoffs, reserve city banks
have come under more reserve pressure in recent weeks relative to
country banks. In October, through the week ending October 19, the
weekly average of reserve city bank borrowing from the Federal Reserve
has been more than $600 million, $120 million higher than in September
and $220 million above August's weekly average. Furthermore, in both
September and October, the weekly average of Federal funds purchased
by net-purchasing banks has been running about $300 million higher than
in August. Over this same period, country bank borrowing from the
Federal Reserve has declined from a $360 million weekly average in
August to around a $240 million average for the first three weeks in
October, in part because of their success in attracting time deposits.
U. S. Government securities market. Since early October,
yields have declined in all maturity sectors of the U. S. Government
securities market. Long-term bond yields currently are at their lowest
levels since June, while Treasury bill rates have fallen well below
their peaks reached around the third week of September.

The recent strength in the U. S. Government securities
market has reflected a growing conviction that the boom in the private
sector of the economy could be tapering off and that in any event a tax
increase will be requested if needed to temper any inflationary impact
from further acceleration in military expenditures. Debt markets also
have been bouyed in recent weeks by growing acceptance of the view that
monetary authorities would not permit another escalation in short-term
interest rates.
In the note and bond sector of the market, trading has
continued to be dominated by the dealers who have built up positions
in longer-term bonds to their highest level since September 1965. On
October 25, the dealers held $208 million of bonds due in more than

III -9
5 years. This compares with small net short positions in this maturity
category in late August when bond yields reached their peaks. Recently,
activity has been quiet as the market has awaited the Treasury announce-
ment of its mid-November refunding.
Treasury bill rates have been influenced in recent weeks by
generally strong demand and scarcities in most maturities. Dealer
positions in longer bills have risen, however, as dealers absorbed
sizable sales of bills by banks following the $3.5 billion auction of
April and June tax bills on October 11.
Yields on most short-term debt instruments other than bills
also have shown some tendency to edge down recently from their peaks,
as the table shows. However, rates on commercial paper and finance
company paper remain at their highs set in late September and mid-
October, respectively, and new issue CD rates at major New York banks
are still at the 5-1/2 per cent ceiling.

Federal Agency securities. The recent declines in yields
on Federal Agency securities have been influenced by developments in
the U.S. Government securities market and also by continued reductions
in the amount of Agency issues held by private investors. Since early
September, Federal Agencies have raised about $465 million of new
money, but the Treasury trust accounts have absorbed $895 million of
such securities, as the table shows. As a result, holdings of private
investors have been reduced by $430 million.

Treasury finance. The Treasury is expected to announce the
terms of its November refunding on October 27. Maturing issues total
about $4.1 billion, including a moderate $3.2 billion held by private
investors. The terms of the new offering will be described in the Green
Book supplement.
On October 22, the Treasury auctioned $1.4 billion of 9-month
and 1-year bills to replace a $1.0 billion maturity and raise $400 million
of new money. A similar auction was held in late September and the new

months ahead. Over the balance of the year and again in the early
weeks of 1967, the Treasury will need to raise a sizable amount of cash
in addition to these auctions. On current Board projections, the total
would approximate $5 billion through January, not counting the monthly
auctions. Some of this money may be obtained in conjunction with the
November refunding, if a cash refinancing is undertaken, but additional
amounts will probably have to be raised by late November or early
December.

Corporate and municipal bond markets. Yields on corporate
and municipal bonds have continued to decline since late September,
reflecting the further modification of market expectations that has
also been affecting yields on U.S. Government securities. The decline
in October therefore amounts to as much as 10 basis points and has
extended the total rate roll-back from the late August highs to more
than 30 basis points in some series.

Flotations of publicly-offered bonds in October are estimated at $525

III -14
million, large relative to prior Octobers, but the lowest monthly volume
since July. And projected volume of public bond offerings in November --
at $575 million -- is less than a year earlier. Thus, despite the
slower rate of growth in business credit at banks, the forward bond
calendar has not evidenced any unusual build-up.
Moreover, total corporate financing in the capital markets,
including public and private issues of bonds, and stocks, is estimated
to have declined in October to about the low monthly levels registered
in July and May. Preliminary estimates also suggest that the seasonal
increase in total corporate financing may be less than usual in November.
Life insurance companies are reported to be expecting smaller take-
downs of corporate bonds over the next few months than in the like
period a year ago. The sharply reduced volume of gross cash flows
currently available for investment at life insurance companies, together
with the over-all decline in new life company commitments made since
the first quarter, lend support to the view that takedowns of corporate
private placements will remain at a reduced level in the period ahead.

The volume of long-term financing by State and local govern-
ments in October ($750 million) will be nearly $100 million less than
a year ago. The 30 basis point point drop in yields since late August
has not produced significant additions to the calendar of previously
postponed issues, and even current yield levels continue to lead to a
few postponements. Beyond the current week in which yields are being
tested by an outsized level of offerings -- including New York City's
$123 million issue -- the forward calendar is not congested and shows
a fairly even weekly distribution of scheduled issues. November
volume is estimated to rise to $850 million, but this would be one-
fifth below the high total a year earlier.

Mortgage market developments. Although recent legislation on a
variety of fronts as well as the downtrend in interest rates on market
securities since September has eased the position of nonbank depository
institutions somewhat, mortgage markets generally appear to have re-
mained very tight. Contract rates for conventional first mortgages on
homes rose 5 to 10 basis points further in September, to 6.65 per cent
for loans to purchase new homes and 6.70 per cent for loans on existing
homes. These levels are about 80 basis points above those a year earlier
when upward pressures on interest rates first began to appear.
The advance in yields has been even sharper for Government-
underwritten mortgages, with secondary market yields on FHA-insured,
30-year mortgages in September up 117 basis points from a year earlier
to an average of 6.63 per cent. To reduce the unusually high discounts
demanded by lenders, the Department of Housing and Urban Development
raised the regulatory maximum contract rate on such mortgages from 5-3/4
to 6.0 per cent effective October 3. This marked the third 1/4 point
increase this year and brought the regulatory maximum to its statutory
limit for the first time in the history of the program. A comparable
adjustment for VA-guaranteed home mortgages was also made by the
Veterans Administration.
In line with these developments, the Federal National Mortgage
Association lowered its price on 5-3/4 per cent mortgages to sellers in
the secondary market by another 2 points effective October 4. Also,
under the expanded secondary market program authorized by Congress late
last summer, FNMA announced an upward adjustment from $15,000 to $25,000

III -18
in the size of mortgages eligible for purchase for new homes provided
final certification of underwriting of such mortgages had been made by
FHA or VA on or after October 19. While this change was made mainly to
stimulate starts of new housing, some increase in the purchase-limit to
$17,500 was also authorized for loans on existing homes. For budgetary
and other reasons, activation of the $1 billion special assistance
authorization, which was also initiated by Congress last summer, has
been deferred for the time being. In recent months, overall purchases
by FNMA have moved downward appreciably from the record highs reached
last March.
Savings flows. In September, savings flows to the major
depositary-type institutions showed a further year-to-year shrinkage,
dropping more than 40 per cent behind September 1965. This compares
with a year-to-year short-fall of 35 per cent in net flows to these in-
stitutions over the first 9 months of 1966.
As in August, the further shrinkage in combined savings flows
was chiefly accounted for by the slower growth of time and savings de-
posits at commercial banks. Even when negotiable CD's are excluded,
savings flows to banks were 50 per cent smaller than in September a year
ago, compared with the 14 per cent reduction in flows experienced for
the first nine months as a whole.
At mutual savings banks, September savings flows continued the
more favorable experience shown in July and August and were only 15 per
cent smaller than in September 1965, much better than the 40 per cent
year-to-year shrinkage experienced over the first nine months. While

III -19
flows to savings and loan associations were still 40 per cent below those
in September 1965, this too represented an improvement, since the short-
fall for the first nine months was 75 per cent. It is too early to assess
the importance of the recent rate legislation to the improved flows in
September at these two types of institutions.

On the basis of a sample survey, staff of the Federal Home Loan
Bank Board estimate that the S & L industry experienced a net loss of
share capital amounting to $350 million (excluding interest credited)
during the last three days of September and $260 million in the first week
of October--the two periods in which quarterly withdrawals are concen-
trated. Nearly 90 per cent of the outflow occurred in the San Francisco
district. Some of the $260 million loss in October will, of course, be
offset by net inflows during the remainder of the month. Though, for
seasonal reasons, the large net outflows which occurred in April and July

III -20
will not be repeated in October, the ultimate result for the month will
fall well below the $610 million net gain of share capital experienced
for the full month of October a year ago.
While no October estimate is available for all mutual savings
banks, the New York State mutuals, which have recently accounted for well
over half of industry flows, experienced a net deposit inflow of $30 mil-
lion during the first two weeks. This was larger than in the comparable
period of 1965, but smaller than in July when most New York City insti-
tutions first raised their rates to 5 per cent.
Stock market. A sharp further decline of common stock prices
in late September and early October carried the major indexes of stock
prices to their lowest levels since President Kennedy's assassination in
November 1963. At the early October low, Standard and Poor's composite
index was 73.20, down 22 per cent from its early February peak. But
since October 7 the index has advanced about 8 per cent.
While virtually all stocks participated in the price retreat
from spring to fall this year, with declines in excess of 30 per cent
fairly general for individual issues, recovery since early October has
been quite selective. There seems to have been some tendency for selected
conservative stocks to show the largest recent gains. A number of these
are typically viewed as defensive stocks, attractive to investors in
periods of slower business activity because of the greater relative
stability of their income and dividends.
Among stock groupings in the defensive category that reached
their lows in August rather than in October, prices of New York City

III -21
bank stocks have advanced about 22 per cent, those of electric utilities
are up almost 14 per cent and those of oils are up over 9 per cent. In
the case of stocks that reached their lows in early October, food issues
have since gained in excess of 7 per cent, issues of telephone companies
more than 8 per cent, and issues of cigarette manufacturers 9 per cent.
In contrast to these advances, stock prices in some industry groupings
considered to be more sensitive to cyclical swings--such as auto and
building material companies--have declined further on balance since
early October.
As one would expect with stock prices declining on balance,
stock market credit also showed some further contraction in September.
At the end of the month, total customers' net debit balances reported by
NYSE firms were about $250 million below their month earlier levels.
Preliminary estimates by the Exchange staff suggest, however, that less
than half of this reported decline actually represented a reduction in
margin account debt (as measured in the Exchange's margin panel sta-
tistics). In the view of the Exchange staff, lower trading volume
around the end of September--relative to August--accounted for part of
the decline, because it reduced debits associated with the clearance of
cash transactions, and a large increase in short positions in September
generated credit entries of a bookkeeping nature which accounted for a
further offset to outstanding debit balances. Making a rough allowance
for these statistical idiosyncracies, the cumulative decline in margin
debt through September, from the April 1966 high of $5.8 billion,
probably amounted to $350 million, or roughly 6 per cent.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
U.S. balance of payments. Weekly indicators show a sizeable
payments deficit on the liquidity basis for the first 19 days of
October -- probably in excess of $500 million. October has regularly
accounted for a major share of the total fourth quarter deficit.*
Thus, while these preliminary and partial October results represent a
sharp deterioration from the rate for the third quarter, and for the
year to date, they do not necessarily represent a deterioration if we
exclude for these periods the favorable effects of debt prepayments
and of known shifts of foreign official and international funds into
non-liquid forms.
For the third quarter, there was a deficit on the liquidity
basis of around $200 million seasonally adjusted, down from the esti-
mate given in the last Green Book primarily by reason of $250 million
of special receipts at the end of September (representing debt pre-
payments and foreign official purchases of U.S. Govt. agency bonds.)
Apart from special receipts, the liquidity deficit in the third
quarter was at an annual rate of around $2 billion, roughly the rate
for the first 9 months on a similarly adjusted basis.
* In 1962 and 1963 the deficit in Ocotber exceeded the fourth
quarter deficit on the liquidity basis; in 1965, October accounted
for essentially all of the fourth quarter deficit; and in 1964, when
there were large outflows late in the year associated with uncertainties
concerning the forthcoming U.S. payments program, the October deficit
was 60 per cent of the total for the quarter.

IV -2
Exports in September were at the July-August level (revised,
with all figures adjusted for carry-over of documents), and for the
third quarter exports were at an annual rate of $29-1/2 billion, up
4 per cent from the second quarter. However, despite the sharp growth
of exports, the trade surplus in the third quarter narrowed (falling
to an annual rate of less than $3 billion, compared to $3-1/2 billion
in the preceding quarter) as imports rose by nearly 7 per cent to an
annual rate of $26-3/4 billion.

The rise in exports through July-August (latest detail
available) consisted of both agricultural and non-agricultural com-
modities. Agricultural exports were stable from mid-1965 to mid-1966,
but in July-August they advanced sharply.
The bulk of the rise in exports in July-August over the
second quarter was to primary producing countries, particularly to
Australia and Latin America. Among the industrial countries JapanI

IV -3
continued to increase purchases of U.S. exports, but shipments to
Canada in July-August were little changed from the second quarter,
and shipments to the United Kingdom and to Continental Western Europe
were somewhat lower.
The adverse effects on the payments position of the cyclically
low trade surplus and of high, and doubtless rising, military expendi-
tures have continued to be partly offset by reduced net outflows of
U.S. private capital. Net repayments of bank-reported claims on
foreigners occurred in the third quarter after seasonal adjustment,
in contrast to a small outflow in the second-quarter. At the be-
ginning of October, banks' claims as reported under the VFCR were
below their target ceiling for the end of 1966 by $1-1/4 billion,
unadjusted; there is normally a seasonal outflow of bank credit of
about $300 million in the fourth quarter, so that the VFCR leeway
might be estimated at less than $1 billion on a seasonally adjusted
basis.
A massive inflow of foreign private liquid funds in the
third quarter resulted in a surplus of more than $1 billion on the
basis of official reserve transactions (preliminary estimate); for
the first 9 months of the year the surplus on reserve transactions
exceeded $1/2 billion. As noted in earlier Green Books, the surplus
resulted from very large shifts of foreign private funds from European
currencies -- and principally from sterling -- into Euro-dollar assets.
This market is doubtless the only Euro-currency market that could
readily absorb an influx of the size represented by the run on sterling,

IV -4
and probably the only market in which such a volume of funds could
readily be invested in liquid, interest-bearing assets. Although the
actions of U.S. banks in bidding for Euro-dollars through their branches
played a part in producing the inflow of foreign liquid funds, the U.S.
surplus on reserve transactions must be regarded as heavily dependent
on decisions of foreign residents to move out of sterling and into
Euro-dollar assets.
Despite the surplus on the basis of official reserve trans-
actions, there was a decline totaling $940 million in our gold stock
and IMF position in the first 9 months (no figures in this paragraph
are seasonally adjusted). There was a net increase of $370 million
in U.S. official holdings of convertible foreign currencies, for the
most part reflecting increased holdings of sterling under swap ar-
rangements. Liquid liabilities to foreign central banks and governments
declined more than $1-1/2 billion, while non-liquid liabilities rose
$1/4 billion.

IV -5
Current economic situation and prospects in industrial coun-
tries. Over the summer months, economic trends among industrial
countries were becoming even more clearly differentiated than earlier
in the year. On the one hand, economic activity in Britain was defi-
nitely turning down, the slowdown of expansion in Germany and Belgium
was continuing, and there were signs that the Dutch and Canadian booms
might be cooling off. On the other hand, the recoveries in France,
Italy, and Japan became broader and now appear to be firmly rooted.
In recent unpublished forecasts, the OECD Secretariat puts the
rate of growth in real GDP of the European countries as a group at 3.9
per cent from 1965 to 1966 and again from 1966 to 1967, about equal to
the 4.0 per cent rate achieved from 1964 to 1965. The OECD Secretariat
foresees a beginning of recovery in the United Kingdom in the course of
next year, and a quickening in the rate of growth not only in France and
Italy but also in Germany. Further slowdowns are looked for in Canada,
the Netherlands, and the Scandinavian countries. Rapid expansion of out-
put is expected to continue in Japan.
In Britain, signs suggesting that the succession of deflationary
measures taken by the Government early in the year and again in July have
taken hold are accumulating. Automobile sales in August-September were
20 per cent below those of the same months in 1965. A further drop in
instalment credit outstanding in August brought consumer credit to its
lowest level since April 1965. The wage freeze, initially voluntary,
has been made compulsory.
Private investment demand is weakening sharply; expenditures
may have turned down in the second quarter. Latest investment intention

IV -6
surveys, conducted by the Board of Trade and by the Confederation of
British Industry, show a sharp deterioration in the investment climate.
The CBI reported that 60 per cent of its respondents in August-September
expected to invest less next year than in 1966. The drop in confidence
about future developments in the order, output and employment situation
between the preceding survey and this one was steeper than any recorded
in the eight-year history of the survey.
Demand for bank loans has fallen off. Seasonally adjusted
outstanding advances of the clearing banks fell sharply from mid-July
to mid-September, putting the banks 3 per cent below their credit ceil-
ing. Since then demand for bank loans has reportedly remained weak
despite business use of funds to make selective employment tax payments.
Weakening domestic demand was not yet reflected in a fall in
industrial output through August. In fact industrial production in-
creased in both July and August. The labor market, however, has clearly
begun to ease. Unemployment, which had been rising slightly since June,
jumped sharply in September and October.
In September the foreign trade deficit on the balance-of-
payments basis virtually disappeared, with both imports and exports
down from August. However, the fall in imports may reflect anticipation
of the removal of the import surcharge scheduled for November. The
drop in exports may reflect tapering off of the bulge in shipments
delayed by the seamen's strike.
In Germany, demand pressures have continued to ease. Expan-
sion of private investment demand has been moderating since the fall of
1965, and private consumption demand is now also growing more slowly.

IV -7
Final domestic expenditures for goods and services in the first six months
of 1966were only 7 per cent higher (valued at current prices) than in
the corresponding period of 1965; this compares with year-to-year
increases of 11 per cent and 9 per cent for the first and second halves
of 1965, respectively.
With domestic demand easing, inflationary pressures have
diminished noticeably. The labor market remains tight, but since March
unemployment has been rising, albeit fractionally, Job vacancies have
been falling steadily since the beginning of the year, and the number of
vacancies per unemployed worker has declined from 5.6 in March (seasonally
adjusted) to 3.1 in August. One reason unemployment remains very low
is that the number of foreign workers in Germany has begun to decline.
Labor hoarding is said to have diminished and labor mobility has increased.
Wage increases are slowing. New contracts are being written
with average increases of 6 per cent a year rather than the 7 per cent
which had been standard until recently, and the gap between increases in
contract rates and effective earnings also appears to be narrowing. As
a result, disposable incomes from wages and salaries have been recording
steadily decreasing year-to-year growth rates since the third quarter
of 1965.
Prices for industrial producers' products remained virtually
stable between May and July and decreased in August. Declines were con-
fined to prices of basic materials, but prices of investment and con-
sumer goods also stopped rising and were stable during the summer months.
Retail prices stabilized for the first time in many months; they were

IV -8
unchanged in June and July and declined seasonally in August. While
the decline was mainly in food prices, price increases in the non-food
sector appear to be moderating.
Smaller domestic order books and the easier labor situation
have put German industry in an excellent position to take advantage
of rising external demand. Exports have in fact been increasing strongly,
and it is expected that by next year this development will have signifi-
cant repercussions on domestic investment demand. From March through
August, however, total new orders to German industry were falling; in
July-August they were at their year-earlier level, even though foreign
orders were up 13 per cent. Industrial production, too, has shown no
net increase since the beginning of this year.
Imports, reflecting easier domestic investment demand, more
cautious inventory policies, and smaller deliveries of military goods,
have leveled off since early this year. As a result, the German trade
surplus averaged about $150 million a month during April-August, com-
parable to its size in 1963 and 1964.
In France, the recovery which began last year has broadened
in 1966. Private investment demand, which leveled off in 1965, has
turned up this year; the latest INSEE survey shows that outlays should
increase substantially over the next twelve months. This development,
combined with a slight quickening in the growth of consumer expenditures
and strongly expanding public investment, is the main factor underlying
OECD Secretariat expectations that the growth of real GDP may reach
an annual rate of 5-1/2 per cent by the second half of 1967 (change
measured from the preceding half year) as compared with 3.8 per cent
for the first half of 1966.

IV -9
So far, the quickening expansion has not generated new in-
flationary pressures. Residential construction, which had continued to
expand gradually through 1964 and 1965, has been relatively stable.
The steady growth in industrial output -- up 8 per cent from mid-1965
to mid-1966 -- has been achieved with only fractionally rising employment.
Productivity has been growing quite fast -- as expected in the early
stages of an upswing -- and wage pressures have remained relatively
moderate. The age distribution of the population is such as to produce
sizable additions to the labor force over the coming year.
Price increases are remaining relatively moderate: retail
prices continue to rise at an annual rate of 2-1/2 to 3 per cent, with
non-food prices rising by about 3 per cent; wholesale prices for finished
goods have remained fairly stable since early this year.
Imports in July-August were up 14 per cent in value from a
year earlier. French exports, after rising strongly to last March,
leveled off in April-August and apparently declined in September. A
substantial balance of payments surplus nevertheless continued to be
expected for coming months; the French reserve losses in September and
early October were probably due in considerable part to movements of
interest-sensitive funds and to increased confidence in sterling.
In Italy, exports and government expenditures are still the
mainsprings of expansion, but reviving private investment and expanding
consumer demand give further buoyancy to economic activity. A recent
upturn in residential construction permits suggests that recovery is
now spreading to this lagging sector. If OECD Secretariat projections

IV -10
are borne out, the annual rate of growth of real GDP will accelerate
to about 7-1/2 per cent in the second half of 1967 (change measured
from the preceding half year) as compared with 5.4 per cent for the
first half of 1966.
As in France, industrial output has easily accommodated
expanding demand. Italian industrial production at mid-year was up
10 per cent from a year earlier. The major part of the rise was
achieved through increases in productivity; manufacturing employment
was up only 2 per cent
Price developments reflect the fact that the Italian expansion
is going forward without strain on resources. Consumer prices are ris-
ing at an annual rate of only 2 per cent, less than in any other in-
dustrial country except Austria. Wholesale prices of investment and
consumption goods have been very stable. Export prices, too, have
remained stable, in contrast to the upward trend exhibited in other
countries. This price stability, combined with the fact that delivery
periods have remained short in Italy, helps to explain the continued
rise in Italian exports, which in July-August were 11 per cent higher
than a year earlier.
In Canada, a number of weak spots are appearing in the economy,
suggesting that the rate of expansion may be slowing. The inflow of new
orders to industry declined from March to July (latest), residential
construction demand has weakened considerably, and automobile sales
in April-July (seasonally adjusted) averaged 11 per cent less than in
the first quarter. Some uncertainties regarding private investment
demand are developing. The June intentions survey indicated a 21 per

IV -11
cent increase in equipment outlays for 1966 over 1965, but recent data
on equipment imports, which generally correlate closely with investment
spending, suggest that this large rise may not fully materialize.
The easier demand situation was reflected in a decline in in-
dustrial production from the April high to July (latest), and an increase
in the unemployment rate from 3.3 per cent in April to 4.0 per cent in
August. Machinery production has been level, and output of various types
of materials, including steel, paper, and construction materials, has
declined.
Wage settlements have been very large, averaging between 5 and
8 per cent this year compared with a range of 3-6 per cent in 1965. Prices
also are continuing to rise fairly strongly: in August wholesale prices
for manufactured goods were 1.2 per cent above the February level, and
retail prices had risen by 2 per cent over the six months. This persistence
of an inflationary atmosphere, despite tightness of bank credit, explains
the Government's announcement in September that an increase in taxes to
cover increased social security benefits will be asked for in November.
In Japan, industrial production has been increasing steadily,
and in August it was 15 per cent higher than a year earlier. Producer
goods and durable consumer goods have registered the most rapid rates of
increase.
The expansion has outrun official Japanese production predictions
made late in 1965. The forecast was that industrial production would be
8 per cent greater in fiscal 1966 (April 1966-March 1967) than in fiscal
1965. This implied, on a straight line basis, a September index of 189
(1960=100). In August, however, the index was already 198.

APPENDIX A: RECENT HOUSING AND RELATED LEGISLATION*
Awaiting the President's signature are two major bills
affecting housing and other real estate. One bill (H.R. 17607) --
which suspends the investment tax credit allowance for business
machinery and equipment -- also suspends for the next 15 months two
methods of accelerated depreciation now permitted on new and recon-
structed real estate properties. The other bill (S. 3708), which has
longer run implications, authorizes the President's demonstration
cities program and other measures.
Tax bill
With one exception, the depreciation provisions of this bill
prohibit taxpayers that order, start, or reconstruct properties between
October 10, 1966 and December 31, 1967, from claiming for income-tax
purposes any accelerated deductions for depreciation at an annual rate
greater than 150 per cent of the applicable straight-line method.
Exempted from the suspension is construction purchased by a taxpayer
during the suspension period for use in his trade or business, to the
extent of an aggregate cost of $50,000.
These provisions, in effect, forbid the use of the present
forms of accelerated property depreciation -- the double declining
balance (200 per cent of straight line) and the sum of the years-
digits systems -- for affected properties ordered or constructed during
the next 15 months. The prohibition applies over the entire useful
life of the new or reconstructed properties. However, the present
150 per cent declining balance and the straight-line systems of depre-
ciation will continue to be allowed for both new and used real estate.
Most market observers feel that the restrictive effect of
these changes on starts of new private rental housing or nonresidential
structures will be minor during the suspension period, partly because
taxes are only one of many factors to be considered. But the precise
effect is hard to foretell because we do not know exactly how much the
suspended double-declining balance system of depreciation has been
used in the past on new properties as compared with other methods of
depreciation that will remain in effect. The suspended sum of the
years-digits method has accounted for only a very limited number of
cases, at least for active construction and real estate corporations

Section, Division of Research and Statistics.

filing tax returns for 1960-61 (the latest available year). In that
period, the sum of the years-digits method was reported in only about
5 per cent of all outstanding cases for which the method of computation
was given for new or used personal or real property.
While the dampening effect on new construction may be small
in the aggregate, some contemplated projects will, without doubt, be
curtailed. In the past, postponement of income taxes by deducting
accelerated depreciation allowances has provided high-leveraged real
estate owners with substantial tax shelter and additional cash flow
through the early life of new properties. During the first ten years,
for example, the double declining method of depreciation -- compared
with the 150 per cent method -- can produce an additional cash flow for
new structures (with 40-year lives) equivalent to about 6 per cent of
the initial cost of the investment. The double declining method may
also permit a larger part of any profit realized from the eventual sale
of the property to be taxed as a capital gain.
For certain new properties, such as hotels-motels or
industrial plants with substantial owner investments in equipment as
well as in structures, suspension of the investment tax credit as well
as suspension of accelerated depreciation will undoubtedly cause their
owners to take another look at their near-term development plans.
Housing bill
The omnibus Demonstration Cities and Metropolitan Development
Act of 1966 seems likely to provide little net stimulus to new con-
struction over the next year. Its principal features are actually of
a longer-run nature; the fiscal year 1967 authorizations are relatively
limited and subject to the usual uncertainties about appropriations and
implementation.
A number of the bill's features are designed to alleviate
some of the basic problems of modern urban living by widening the scope
of Federal assistance to include whole sections of cities or entire
metropolitan areas. Among its many provisions are the following:
(1) a new $1.2 billion demonstration-city program (through 1969) to
eliminate physical and social blight within entire city neighborhoods,
to be financed by Federal planning grants and supplemental development
grants; $12 million in appropriations is authorized for the current
fiscal year; (2) a new $75 million program of supplemental grants
(through 1968) to assist public agencies in carrying out area-wide
development projects for public facilities; $25 million is authorized
this year; (3) a broadened program of FHA-mortgage insurance of land-
development loans to include tracts in new communities; FNMA could
purchase such loans under its special assistance program; (4) a new

A- 3
program of FHA insurance of loans to finance the construction and
equipment of facilities for the group practice of medicine, optometry,
or dentistry; (5) new authority for FNMA under its special assistance
program to participate in making construction loans on certain FHA-
insured cooperative, urban renewal, or below-market-rate housing
projects; to date, FNMA's authority has been limited to purchasing
permanent loans on completed projects.

APPENDIX B: FARM EXPORTS*
Farm products moved overseas in record volume during fiscal
1965-66. According to Department of Agriculture estimates, dollar
earning on farm exports (actual dollar sales plus imputed earning on
aid-financed programs) exceeded the value of farm imports by nearly a
billion dollars. This favorable balance, and one nearly as favorable
in the preceding year, compares with negative balances on agricultural
merchandise trade from 1960 through 1963 and a very small plus balance
in 1964. Further expansion in the over-all volume of exports is in
prospect in the coming year.
The 1965-66 export was valued at $6.7 billion, 10 per cent
more than the record export of 1964-65. The big gain was in commercial
exports for dollars with sales exceeding last year by 15 per cent.
Government-financed sales under P.L. 480 and the AID programs amounted
to $1.6 billion, down 5 per cent from the preceding year. Export
subsidies were used to bring prices of wheat, cotton, rice and tobacco,
into a competitive position with world prices on both cash and
government-financed transactions.
The commodity "mix" of the 1965-66 export total revealed a
substantial reshuffling in relative importance of commodities moving
into world trade from the United States. Of the traditional "Big
Three" -- wheat, cotton, tobacco -- only wheat retained its top
position in 1965-66. As shown in the table, cotton and tobacco ranked
below feed grains and soybeans in value in the past year. Wheat owes
its retention of top position to subsidies on commercial exports and
to large P.L. 480 shipments from surplus stocks only recently brought
down to manageable levels from the peak surplus of 1961. In fact,
the reduction in wheat stocks has been largely achieved through massive
P.L. 480 shipments coupled with moderate cuts in production.
Markets for feed grains, largely dollar markets, have been
rising with the fast-growing food livestock industries abroad. However,
poor feed crops in many parts of the world gave a fill-up to the
1965-66 market which may not reoccur in 1966-67. Soybeans are benefiting
from rising demand for animal feeds abroad and also from a broad shift
in consumer tastes away from animal oils to vegetable oils. On the
supply side, soybeans have benefitted from the gap in world trade created
by the reduced export availabilities in Red China.

New farm programs are expected to encourage expansion in
cotton exports in the current year. Cotton exports of 3,065 thousand
bales in 1965-66 were 32 per cent below the 4,491 thousand bales
exported the year before. Our exports in 1965-66 were held down by
larger export availabilities in other net exporting countries and by
both lower mill consumption rates in the major importing countries
and by importers' reluctance to add to stocks until the new low price
of 21 cents per pound on U.S. cotton (the key to the world price) took
effect on August 1, 1966.
