SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK
Outlook for economic activity
An increase of $12 billion in GNP is now indicated for the
current quarter and a slightly smaller increase for the first quarter
1967. In real terms, these projected increases are at an annual rate
of about 3.5 per cent. The fourth-quarter increase is somewhat smaller
than we projected 3 weeks ago, mainly because the recent Commerce/SEC
survey indicated a smaller rise in business plant and equipment outlays
and because the most recent housing starts figures suggest a deeper
decline in residential construction.
The marked slowing of the pace of expansion in business
investment in plant and equipment is beginning sooner than the large
build-up in equipment order backlogs would seem to have warranted.
Fixed capital spending was somewhat lower in the third quarter than
indicated earlier, and spending programs for the current quarter have
been lowered appreciably. The survey also indicates a progressive
tapering off of expansion in the first half of 1967.
Auto sales continue to lag both third quarter and year-
earlier levels, and future buying intentions for both autos and house-
hold durable goods were reported relatively weak in mid-October. Despite
further gains in nondurable goods, total retail sales remained stable
through November, in marked contrast to the sharp rise in the autumn of
1965. Increases in total consumer spending in the current quarter and
those projected for early 1967 are smaller than in the third quarter.

I- 2
Meanwhile, employment and incomes continued to expand at a
rapid rate through November. The strength exhibited in these series
contrasts with other evidence indicating slackening in consumer demands
as well as some slowing in growth of the economy as a whole. The pro-
jections of consumer income and spending imply a sizable increase in
the saving rate through the first quarter from the low third-quarter
figure; this would not be inconsistent with the recent slackening in
consumer credit expansion.
Residential construction is clearly down sharply further in
the current quarter, but the rate of decline is likely to moderate
appreciably in the first quarter. Tapering off of the decline in con-
struction activities would help support expansion in total GNP. But
slackening of the pace of increase in the business equipment sector can
be expected to exert downward pressure on GNP, directly and through its
influence on the rate of business inventory accumulation in the current
and next quarters.
The current and future course of defense spending still
remains uncertain. Prospects are for further sizable increases in such
spending, but it seems unlikely that it will continue at the extra-
ordinary third quarter rate. We are projecting progressively smaller
increases in the fourth and first quarters, but it must be emphasized
most strongly that this is conjecture and as such, should not be used
publicly.

I-3
Priced and resource use
Reflecting a mixture of influences, the rise in industrial
commodity prices--which was interrupted chiefly by declines in prices
of some sensitive materials--probably has been resumed but at a lesser
rate than earlier in the year. Wholesale prices of foodstuffs already
have declined sharply in response to expansion in supplies, and they may
not decline further. But the decreases had not yet been reflected at
retail when foods were priced in early October for the latest consumer
price index, and decreases in food prices are expected in indexes for
subsequent months. Recent increases in retail prices for other goods
have been mainly seasonal; e.g., auto prices rose with elimination of
seasonal discounts on the old models but prices of new models are not
significantly higher than a year ago. Service prices continue to rise
at a rapid rate.
Capacity utilization in manufacturing may have eased a bit
from the 91 per cent rate of the third quarter. The rise in output of
business and defense equipment probably has been limited by capacity or
labor supply, but slackening in demand has resulted in actual cutbacks
in production of autos and announced reductions in output of some house-
hold durable goods. The demands of these industries for steel and other
materials--including some nondurables--consequently has been or will be
curtailed, and demands for some building materials and supplies are
being reduced by the decline in residential construction. In some of
those industries experiencing an easing in demands for their products,
prices may be held in check even if wage increases push up unit labor
costs.

I-4
Although press reports point to occasional elimination of
overtime and selective layoffs in consumer durable goods industries,
the November statistics showed a substantial further expansion in
employment in manufacturing as well as most nonmanufacturing lines.
The unemployment rate fell back to the low of 3.7 per cent touched
earlier this year, and the average factory workweek was unchanged from
October.
Bank credit and deposits
The outlook for the commercial banking system continues
to be dominated by the interaction of investor demands for CD's with
the need for banks to accommodate financing needs of their business
customers. After tapering off in late summer and early fall, business
loan expansion slowed further last month, most notably at banks outside
New York. Business loan growth is likely to be more rapid than in
December, but still considerably below the pace of the first half of
the year. Although corporate tax payments are estimated to be about
$1.3 billion higher this year than last, a good part of the added tax
need may be financed by using funds from maturing CD's. Meanwhile, non-
tax financing demands of business could be relatively moderate, assuming
the rate of business inventory accumulation does not show any pick-up
during the last few weeks of the year.
If business loan expansion does not accelerate sharply this
month, there may still be pressure on banks from a short-term spurt in
other bank loans and from CD runoffs. Government security dealers may

I -5
have greater recourse to banks as repurchase agreements with corporations
mature around the dividend and tax dates. And sales finance companies
are likely to draw on bank credit lines as their outstanding market paper
matures.
With respect to CD's, even with present rate relationships,
the December runoff could well be larger than the estimated $400 million
in November. Preliminary estimates indicate that CD maturities in
December have risen to a record $5.5 billion. Moreover, it normally
takes several weeks for banks to regain the large amounts of funds lost
over the December dividend and tax dates. Meanwhile, U.S. Government
deposits will be drawn down on average during the month. Although such
deposits will begin to rise in the latter part of the month, they will
remain at relatively low levels by year-end, so that many banks will
find themselves with considerably less Government deposits than they
normally have at this time of year.
Thus, unless there is a marked resumed expansion in bank
reserves, pressures on banks could be generally sustained over the weeks
immediately ahead, although they probably will be less intense than in
early fall and may ease off further in the early weeks of the new year.
Outlook for capital markets
In corporate and municipal bond markets, upward pressures on
interest rates recently moderated, as evidence of less restraint in
money markets has been widely interpreted as a modest shift in Federal
Reserve policy. The market appears now to be awaiting the specifics of

I 6
the new Federal budget. Meanwhile, the heavy weight of current and
prospective new issue volume--particularly in the corporate market--
might inhibit any significant decline in long-term interest rates in
the period immediately ahead; and some rate pressures are possible as
the process of market digestion of the new securities continues.
The apparent decline in business spending plans, however,
may lead to a tendency for capital market rates to decline over the
longer run. Such a tendency could be offset in some degree by sizable
Treasury offerings of participation certificates; at least a modest
offering appears possible before year-end. In a favorable atmosphere,
businesses and State and local governments, which earlier had been
discouraged from financing by tight market conditions, might also be
encouraged to come back to market. It is difficult to quantify the
likely volume of such offerings, however, and the pressure they exert
on market generally will depend not only on the outlook for capital
spending at the time but also on the nature of bank and other investor
portfolio adjustments.
With respect to banks, the analysis of the preceding section
suggests little if any support to capital markets in the period immed-
iately ahead, but banks could become more of a positive factor after
the new year. Meanwhile, net inflows of funds to savings and loan
associations are likely to remain sluggish over the rest of this year.
It is difficult to evaluate their likely loss experience in January
after the interest-crediting period, but drastic losses are likely to
be avoided given prospective market conditions.

I- 7
With only gradual easing in the position of institutional
investors likely, mortgage funds probably will remain relatively limited
for a while longer. The mortgage market will be aided to some extent
as Federal Home Loan Banks resume expansion advances, but a rapid
reversal of tight mortgage conditions is likely to be dependent mostly
on a significant and sustained decline in interest rates on market
securities. Finally, it should be noted that the rather low levels to
which commitments have fallen in mortgage markets may make the volume
of new forward commitments quite sensitive to even a modest pick-up in
new savings flows.
Balance of payments
The deficit on the liquidity basis in October and November
was almost as large as in the corresponding months two years ago when
outflows of U.S. capital swelled in anticipation of new governmental
restraints. However, regular year-end receipts (possibly including
British debt service payments, which were waived in 1964 and 1965),
together with an expected large receipt from Germany under the military
offset agreement, could still bring the liquidity deficit for the fourth
quarter down below $3/4 billion, making the published total for the year
about $1-1/2 billion.
The balance on the basis of official reserve transactions,
also a deficit in October and November, will continue to depend heavily
upon developments in the Euro-dollar market and related changes in the
liabilities of U.S. banks to their foreign branches. These liabilities

I-8
showed only a modest net increase in November. If they decline toward
year-end, as in earlier years, this would enlarge the official settle-
ments deficit for the quarter, and leave the balance for the year near
zero.
Merchandise trade figures for October are consistent with
earlier expectations of a turnaround in the trade balance and the current
account. Exports rose sharply further, imports advanced only moderately,
and the balance improved. Given the current prospects for domestic
demand, further slackening of the advance in imports is to be expected
in the months ahead. Strength in exports is hoped for, but the reper-
cussions of developing weakness in the internal economies of Britain,
Germany, and Canada may make the export trend less buoyant than in
recent months.
Bank-reported flows of U.S. capital were negligible in
October, and November-December outflows may be smaller than seasonal.
Some renewed outflow in 1967, however, is to be expected if U.S. credit
conditions ease, and would not be prevented by compliance with the vol-
untary program for 1967, to be announced this week.
Direct investment outflows diminished in the third quarter,
but the large liquidity deficit in October-November may reflect a new
increase. The direct investment restraint program for 1967 will
attempt to hold outflows below the 1966 level, but will probably have
difficulty doing so unless U.S. corporations not only seek foreign
financing aggressively but also scale down their spending plans abroad.

I-9
Both current and capital transactions have been greatly
influenced by temporary factors this year. The year's liquidity deficit
may prove fairly representative of the longer-term underlying trend, with
the temporary swelling of merchandise imports as a result of excess do-
mestic demand roughly offsetting temporary inflows of foreign nonliquid
capital and of U.S. bank credit.
On the other hand, the official settlements balance has been
unusually favorable this year, because of the large inflow of foreign
liquid funds. Cessation and partial reversal of that flow could produce
a large official settlements deficit in 1967 even if the liquidity
deficit does not change much.

THE ECONOMIC PICTURE IN DETAIL
The Nonfinancial Scene
Gross national product. We have again lowered our sights
on the amount of rise in prospect for GNP in the current quarter. We
are now estimating an increase of $12 billion--to a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of $756.5 billion--and in the first quarter of 1967 we
are projecting continued expansion at close to this rate. These dollar
gains are little different from the increase now shown for the third
quarter, and in real terms, growth over the period from midyear through
winter holds at an estimated annual rate of about 3.5 per cent.
A major new demand development has been the finding, in the
latest Commerce-SEC quarterly survey, that business has reduced its
fixed capital spending in the last half of this year. Actual outlays
for new plant and equipment were apparently somewhat lower than estima-
ted earlier in the third quarter, and spending planned for the current
quarter has been reduced appreciably. This is the first significant
downward revision in the surveys since 1963.
The increase now programmed for plant and equipment outlays
from the second to the fourth quarter is at an annual rate of 8-1/2 per
cent--down from 11-1/2 per cent projected last summer (and the 17 per
cent rate realized between the fourth quarter 1965 and the second quarter
of this year). Progressive further slowing of expansion is indicated
in the first half of next year--to an annual rate of only 4-1/2 per

II -2
cent--and, in view of the marked tapering off of expansion indicated
by this government survey to midyear and the small increases projected
for the whole year 1967 by recent private surveys, business fixed invest-
ment outlays could well level off or decline in the second half of 1967.
The recent weakening of business fixed investment plans undoubtedly
reflects businessmen's re-appraisal of the economic outlook and the
limited availability of funds for financing capital spending as well
as their reactions to suspension of the 7 per cent investment tax
credit and of accelerated depreciation allowances on newly acquired
structures.
Residential construction also has contributed to the
smaller rise now anticipated for GNP in the current quarter. Housing
starts showed an unexpectedly large drop in October and, as a result,
the fourth quarter estimate of residential building has been reduced
further. Meanwhile revised figures indicate a somewhat higher level
for the third quarter. The decline from the third to fourth quarter
is now estimated at $2.8 billion, the same as from the second to the
third quarter. It now appears probable that little further decline
is likely in early 1967. A tapering off of the decline in this
sector, which has been a major downdrag in the last half of this
year, would provide an offsetting influence in terms of total GNP
to further slackening of expansion foreseen in other sectors of the
economy.
The rise in consumption expenditures estimated for the
current quarter remains about as projected three weeks ago--and

II -3
smaller than in the third quarter. Some further slackening in the
rise is projected for the first quarter. The outlook for sales of
autos and household durable goods remains relatively uncertain--
sales have been lagging recently and near-term buying intentions in
mid-October were reported by Census to be down significantly from
year-earlier levels. Total dollar purchases of consumer durable goods
are projected as holding at the third quarter level in the current and
following quarter; in line with recent retail sales trends, expenditures
on nondurable goods continue to rise and services maintain their rapid
rate of expansion.
In contrast to evidence of slackening in the rise in consumer
spending since the summer, expansion in personal income has speeded up.
Payroll employment and personal income rose rapidly in October and
November, and the increases in both total personal and disposable
income estimated for the fourth quarter are considerably larger than
their third quarter gains. As a result of this indicated upward diver-
gence of expansion in consumer incomes from spending, the saving rate
is estimated as recovering in the current quarter from the large
decline in the third quarter (when consumer spending bulged sharply).
A further increase in the saving rate is projected for the first quarter--
to a more normal level close to the average in 1964 and 1965.
The rate of inventory accumulation, which showed a sizable
decline in the third quarter from the exceptionally high second quarter
rate, is estimated as declining further in the current and following

II -4
quarter. The projected decline in the rate of accumulation is expected
to result from slackening of expansion in final sales and output of
consumer goods and business equipment, as well as from the sharp curtail-
ment in construction activity. The extent of the decline over this
period will depend, to an important degree, on the speed with which
output curtailments are instituted in response to lagging sales. In
the auto and appliance industries such output curtailments are now
being instituted, and in the business equipment industries output
increases have been slowing in recent months.
The Vietnam War and defense spending remain, by all indications,
major expansive influences on the economy. A $3.5 billion rise in
defense spending is still being estimated for the current quarter--below
the third quarter increase largely because the latter included the
special military and civilian pay increases. Although there is little
evidence on which to base such an estimate, a rise of $2.5 billion is
projected for the first quarter.
Industrial production. Industrial production in November
is tentatively estimated to rise by only about 0.2 per cent and thus
to remain at 159 rounded. This was the same level as in October and
about 0.5 per cent above the August-September level. Output of steel
and autos declined but output of most other durable goods is expected
to have shown some increase. Auto assemblies in November did not

Steel ingot production declined about 2 per cent further.
In October, total output of iron and steel mill products was already
down 5 per cent from the record summer level but was still relatively
high. Two factors have contributed to the high rate of mill operations:
consumption of steel in consuming industries has been at record levels
and, according to trade reports, the steel mills themselves have been
increasing inventories. November manhour data suggest further gains
in output in many metal consuming industries, i.e., fabricated metal
products, electrical and nonelectrical machinery, aircraft, and
ordnance.
Preliminary November data for the nondurable industries suggest
a continuation of the recent pattern of little change. Output of
apparel, paper, and textiles, has edged downwards since midsummer.
Demand for household appliances has been softening. The
output index for this group, while fluctuating from month to month,
has remained at an advanced level since last April, but at the end of
November and in early December, some producers announced cutbacks in
output. Trade reports are ambiguous regarding the reasons for the
cutbacks, but it no doubt reflects in part the sharply reduced volume
of residential construction.
Production of construction materials also has been cut back.
The rise in output of these materials accelerated in the last quarter
of 1965 and by March 1966 output was at a new high. Since then it has
declined and by October was down 5 per cent. Lumber production in late

II -7
1965 and early 1966 was stimulated by the escalation of the war in
Vietnam and the threat of a strike. With peaceful settlement of
the labor contract and with the sharp decline in residential construc-
tion, an oversupply quickly developed and by September lumber production
had declined 15 per cent. However, output of most other major
construction materials--concrete, structural metal parts, flat glass--
has remained at advanced levels reflecting the continued relatively
high rate of total public and private nonresidential construction.
Autos. Sales of new domestic automobiles were at a
seasonally adjusted rate of 8.4 million units in November. While this
was 4 per cent above October, it was slightly below the third quarter
average, and was 7 per cent below the unusually high 9 million rate a
year ago. Whether the apparent strengthening in sales from October
to November can be taken as a favorable indication of the future sales
outlook for the industry remains questionable,
Dealer inventories on November 30, at approximately 1.3
million units, are expected to remain unchanged in December as the
industry adjusts production schedules down from an annual rate of 9.1
million units in October to 8.5 million units in November and possibly
to a lower rate in December.
Consumer credit. Consumers added $380 million to their
instalment debt in October. Excluding the auto strike period in the
fall of 1964, this was the smallest monthly increase in four years.
In September, the increase had amounted to $475 million, but that, too,
was the smallest for a long time.

II -8
The instalment credit expansion has been at a relatively
slow pace most of the year, and even assuming some pick-up in the final
two months, the increase in outstandings for the year as a whole is
not likely to reach $7 billion, as compared with a rise of $8 billion
in 1965.
Recent weakness in consumer credit has affected all major
credit lines--autos, home goods, home improvements, and personal loans.
New extensions declined in October for the second month in a row in
each of these categories. Meanwhile, repayments have continued to move
up, although at a slightly slower pace than a year earlier.
Credit grantors are continuing to pursue restrictive lending
policies. As would-be borrowers are screened more carefully, a higher
proportion of applicants is being rejected than at this time last year.
The trade press recently has reported elimination by some retailers of
the option under which a customer who settles his account in 90 days
pays no interest. This practice had been particularly prevalent among
furniture and apparel stores.
Auto terms have been becoming more restrictive, too. The
proportion of new car contracts written for 36 months was rising
steadily by 2 or 3 points a year from 1961 to 1965, but during 1966
the proportion has tended down slightly. The typical new car contract
still calls for a 36-month maturity, but apparently somewhat fewer
applicants are now being rated sufficiently credit-worthy to obtain
such favorable terms.

Consumer buying plans. In mid-October, according to the Census
quarterly survey of consumer buying intentions, the proportion of house-
holds reporting intentions to buy autos and major household durable
goods within 6 months was significantly below a year earlier, and the
number reporting intentions to buy either a new or previously occupied
house within 12 months was down considerably.
For new cars, the proportion of households reporting intentions
to buy within 6 months was 4.8 per cent, well below a year earlier
(5.5 per cent) and the lowest since 1963, On the other hand, 12-month
buying intentions held up much better, amounting to 10.4 per cent of
households as compared with the record.October 1965 figure of 10.6
per cent. Current uncertainties, such as availability of credit,
draft status and perhaps safety considerations, appear to be affecting
intentions to buy in the near term, although spending propensities
over the longer term still seem relatively strong.

II -10
Intentions to buy used cars are down considerably, both
on a 6-month basis (4.1 per cent as compared with the year-ago 4.5
per cent) and on a 12-month basis (7.5 per cent versus 8.2 per cent).
The mid-October 12-month buying plan figure is the lowest since this
quarterly survey began in 1959.
The decline from a year ago in 6-month buying intentions for
household durable goods--to 18 per cent from 19 per cent, for one or
more of the 7 major items covered in the survey--followed a sequence
of unusually strong gains in the three preceding surveys taken this
year. The recent decline from a year-ago reflected primarily lower
purchase plans for washing machines, refrigerators, and television
sets, although, as compared with the earlier surveys in 1966, demands
for other household equipment also appear to be not so strong.
The proportion of households reporting current incomes
above a year earlier was down from the October 1965 survey, but
consumers' income expectations over the coming year remained relatively
strong.
Orders for durable goods. New orders for durable goods
declined nearly 5 per cent in October, following a 7 per cent increase
in September. Unfilled orders continued to expand in October, although
at a reduced pace.
Most of the large September-October changes in new orders
reflected fluctuations in defense products, which declined about 30
per cent in October after spurting nearly 50 per cent in September.

II -12
While the rate of inventory accumulation was speeding up
during the spring and summer, manufacturers' shipments were showing
little change and stock-sales ratios increased appreciably. But the
ratio has levelled off this fall. In September, and also in October,
the total book value of factory stocks represented 1.70 months'
shipments, as compared with an average ratio of 1.61 in 1965 and
early 1966.

Moderate liquidation of stocks continued in the auto
industry in October (the unusual build-up shown for the third quarter
was concentrated in July and August). Another major factor contribu-
ting to the smaller increase in October than in the third quarter was
the slackening of the pace of increase in the business and defense
equipment sector, where earlier this year inventory accumulation hadCTOBER

The October level for defense products, while down sharply from the
extraordinary September peak, was only a little below the average for
the first eight months of the year and resulted in an appreciable
further increase in the order backlog for this sector.
Apart from defense products, new orders on balance rose
somewhat in October owing mainly to sharp recovery in the auto industry
from reduced summer levels. New orders for steel showed a sizable
decline. Orders for machinery and equipment, which had shown only
a small further rise during the summer decreased in October although
order backlogs in these industries continued to expand. The October
level of new orders for the total of all durable goods except defense
products was little changed from the average level prevailing during
the first three quarters of the year, with October new orders for
machinery and equipment and autos and other consumer durables
moderately above early 1966 and orders for steel and construction
materials down.
Manufacturers' inventories. The rate of accumulation of
inventories by manufacturers, which had accelerated sharply from
February through August, slowed considerably in September and, in
October, held at about the September rate. The book value increase
for September has been revised upward to $774 million (from the
preliminary showing of a $695 million increase) and the October
rise totaled $822 million; these increases are almost one-third
smaller than the August rise of $1,152 million. The October inven-
tory increase may still be on the high side as an indicator of the
possible average monthly rise during the fourth quarter.

II -13
accelerated sharply. While one month's figure should not be taken to
indicate a trend, some moderating tendency would appear to be in order
in this sector, in line with the lag in new orders and slower growth
of output of business equipment in recent months and the prospective
slowdown in the rate of increase in final takings--especially for
business equipment but perhaps also for defense products.
In contrast to lower rates of accumulation elsewhere, inventory
accumulation in October was above third quarter--and earlier--rates for
consumer durables other than autos and for construction materials. This
step-up was probably temporary. Both sectors are subject to downward
pressures from slack in final demands. Since October, output
curtailments have been announced for some appliances, and output of
construction materials has been trending downward.
Construction activity. Data on housing starts and permits
for November and possible revisions for October are not yet available.
Analysis of the decline in the seasonally adjusted annual rate of starts
in October to 848,000 suggests the probability, however, that the
October reading may appreciably overstate the extent of decline
that will eventually be reported for the fourth quarter as a whole.
While starts reached a 20-year low in October, a large part
of the drop was anticipated because, in a period when starts are under
as abnormal downward pressure as at present, usual seasonal movements
can hardly be expected to prevail, and in October unadjusted starts
are normally expected to turn temporarily higher by about an implied

II -14
10 per cent. Given the fact that the seasonal adjustment factors
decline sharply in the late fall and winter months, the seasonally
adjusted starts series seems likely to rise in these months to rates
significantly above the October level. At best, however, the rate
for the fourth quarter as a whole is projected to average no more than
1 million, and this would still be down at least 8 per cent further
from the reduced third quarter average.
Partly because of seasonal adjustment considerations, staff
projections of starts are currently for little or no change in the
first quarter of 1967 from the fourth quarter of this year. However,
a further drop in the starts rate seems quite likely during the second
quarter. Normally, unadjusted starts rise more than 50 per cent in
the second quarter, but in view of the presently restricted flow of
funds, the low level of commitments, and the relatively limited--though
augmented--help currently being made available from FNMA and the
Federal Home Loan Banks, a spring rise of this magnitude now appears
to be more than can be expected. Further easing of mortgage funds
during the second quarter would exert its major impact on starts in
subsequent quarters because of lags between loan commitments and starts.
In the case of new construction expenditures, indications are
that the present quarter will show a further downtrend, owing mainly to
the drop in private residential outlays. In October, the latest
month for which data are available, total expenditures were running
below their third quarter average. While the trend for the private
nonresidential and public components appeared to be relatively favorable,
both types of activity remained below the peaks reached in the first
quarter of the year.

Total new construction outlays will probably decline further
in the first quarter of next year even though some slowing in the rate
of decline in residential construction expenditures is expected. Non-
residential construction expenditures, like public expenditures, are
still unusually high and construction contracts and other information
confirm the possibility of some further slackening from earlier peaks,
owing to tax, cost, and other considerations. In the case of public
construction expenditures, further attempts by the Administration is
likely to limit such activity further.
Plant and equipment expenditures. Business outlays for
new plant and equipment will continue rising but at sharply reduced
rates in the first two quarters of 1967, according to the Commerce-SEC
Survey conducted in late October and November. Moreover, the estimates
for the third and fourth quarters of 1966 and the year as a whole
have been reduced.

II -16
In the second quarter of 1967 such outlays are now indicated
to be only 2.3 per cent more than estimated for the fourth quarter and
6.6 per cent more than in the second quarter of 1966. Quarterly
increases in plant and equipment spending have become progressively
smaller since the beginning of this year.

According to this survey, third quarter outlays were $400
million (anual rate) less then reported in the August survey and plans
for the fourth quarter have been reduced nearly $1 billion (annual rate).
For the year, outlays are now estimated at $60,6 billion, up 16.5 per
cent from 1965; as compared with a gain of 17.1 per cent shown by the
August survey.

II -17
The Commerce-SEC survey findings for the first two quarters,
coupled with the earlier McGraw-Hill survey for the whole year suggest
a levelling off or a decline in spending after mid-1967. In recent
years of vigorously expanding activity early plans were revised up as
the year progressed. However, current prospects of more moderate
growth in activity next year, together with scheduled termination at
the beginning of 1968 of the suspensions of the investment tax credit
and the accelerated depreciation allowances, may well limit upward
revisions in 1967 spending plans, or even result in downward revisions.
Cutbacks from earlier plans in the third and fourth quarters
of 1966,as reported in the latest survey, are the first of significance
since 1963. Plans were lowered by producers of motor vehicles and
parts, all major nondurable goods industries except petroleum products,
transportation industries, and the communication-commercial sector.
Several industries, however, raised planned outlays, including: primary
metals, machinery, transportation equipment other than motor vehicles,
petroleum products, and mining and public utilities.
Manufacturers' capital appropriations. Manufacturers approved
new capital appropriations of $6 billion, seasonally adjusted, in the
third quarter of this year according to the latest NICB survey. This
represented a 15 per cent decline from the second quarter and was only
3 per cent above a year earlier. An advance estimate (confidential)
suggests some recovery in the fourth quarter. This series is highly
volatile but the third quarter decline--although it followed a 12
per cent rise in the second quarter--was considerably larger than the

II -.18
usual range of fluctuations in this series. The bulk of the third quarter
decline was in nondurable goods industries--down 28 per cent, as compared
with a decline of only 4 per cent in durable goods industries.
The backlog of unspent appropriations edged up further in
the third quarter despite the decline in newly approved appropriations.
This rise in backlogs was the smallest since early 1963.
Labor market. Demands for labor were stronger in November
than had been anticipated. The rise in nonfarm employment so far in
the fourth quarter has been at a faster rate than in the third quarter,
and the unemployment rate has declined to 3.7 per cent. The average
workweek in manufacturing--one of the most sensitive indicators in a
tight labor market--continued at a high average of 41.3 hours, unchanged
over the month and only slightly lower than the postwar peak reached in
earlier months this year.
Unemployment. Much of the advance in employment in recent
months has been accounted for by sharp growth in the labor force of
adult women in response to expanding demands. But, in addition, some
further inroads in unemployment appear to have been made among most
groups in November. The rate for adult men continued close to fric-
tional levels, with the rate for married men declining to 1.7 per cent,
the lowest this year. The rate for adult women decreased to 3.5 per cent
from 4.0 per cent in October. But the unemployment situation among
teenagers and nonwhite workers also showed some slight improvement but

II -19
their rates continued relatively high. The teenage rate in November
was at a new low for the year. The unemployment rate for nonwhite
workers, at 7.4 per cent, has also been reduced somewhat from the summer
months and a year earlier. It remained, however, 2-1/3 times as high
as for white workers.
Nonfarm employment. Nonfarm payroll employment rose by 270,000
a more rapid advance than the average over the past year. Gains were
widespread, with State and local government, services and manufacturing
again leading, while construction employment continued to decline.
The unemployment rate in the construction industry rose slightly
further to 9.3 per cent, well above the 7.4 per cent rate prevailing
in March.
In manufacturing, employment rose substantially. Moreover,
the increase in durable goods employment was limited in part by strikes
against G.E. and Westinghouse. A lack of increase in the transportation
equipment industry resulted from reductions in auto production and a
strike of 10,000 workers at West Coast shipyards. Almost all nondurable
goods industries added to their work forces in November.

Wages and unit labor costs. Average hourly earnings of
production workers in manufacturing industries rose to $2.76 and were
4.2 per cent higher than a year earlier. Year-to-year increases of
more than 4 per cent have been maintained in recent months, compared
with a 3.5 per cent average gain in the first half of this year. Added
pressure on hourly earnings in December will come from the October rise
in the Consumer Price Index. Over a million workers in the automobile
and parts, aerospace, construction and farm equipment industries received
a 3-cent cost-of-living increase early in December. All of these
workers have now received 11 cents an hour in cost-of-living adjustments
for 1966 compared with 4 cents in 1965.

II -21
Wage increases in manufacturing have been exceeding gains in
productivity and have been reflected in reported increases in unit
labor costs. Newly revised figures have become available which incor-
porate more recent estimates of supplements to wages and utilize improved
computation procedures. These data show that unit labor costs, which
had been holding relatively stable for several years, began to rise
toward the end of last year, and in the past few months have been
averaging more than 2 per cent higher than a year earlier; the previous
series had shown an increase over the year of only about one per cent.
The revised series appears to be more in line with recent trends in
earnings. Average hourly earnings in manufacturing have been rising
steadily throughout 1966, reflecting upward pressure on wages from
higher contract settlements--which have recently been in the 5 per
cent range--as well as the highest cost-of-living wage adjustments in
many years.

do not provide very reliable indicators of the most recent behavior
of prices. The BLS weekly estimates of the wholesale index for
industrial commodities shows no change from October, but the compre-
hensive monthly index probably will show an increase; and the October
increase in the consumer price index was as large as the average increase
over the preceding four months, but the November increase is not
likely to be so large.
The BLS weekly estimates for industrial commodities are over-
weighted with sensitive materials, and they have been relatively stable
since mid-October following an appreciable decline from the spring peak.
The BLS daily index of 13 basic industrials also has leveled out since
mid-October after declining 15 per cent from its March peak. However,
price increases to take effect in November and December have been
announced for agricultural machinery, commercial and home air-conditioners,
and other electrical equipment. Some chemicals and fuels also have
increased.
Wholesale prices of foodstuffs declined further in late
October and then turned relatively stable in November at an average
level about 1.5 per cent lower than the index for mid-October. Live-
stock and meats, accounting for most of the decline, fell about 5 per
cent further to the lowest levels in more than a year.

II -23
Retail prices of meats still had not shown much decline by
early October, the pricing period for the latest consumer price index;
they were down only 0.5 per cent from September and were still about
5 per cent higher than in the autumn a year ago. The October decrease
in prices of foods for home consumption consequently was small and the
total for foods including restaurant meals was unchanged. A decline
in food prices is expected in November.
With foods not providing any offset to increases in prices
of other commodities and services, the total consumer price index
showed another large increase in October (see table below). Services
(not including rent) rose another 0.5 per cent, with medical care
continuing to lead the way with an increase of nearly 1 per cent. The
reported rise in rent has picked up slightly; in the four months from
June to October the index rose 0.7 per cent or as much as in the
first half of the year.
The increase in nonfood commodities was seasonal. Furniture
and some household supplies increased, but apparel and fuels rose less
than seasonally, and although new cars rose considerably more than
seasonally, they did so mainly because of the earlier introduction of
1967 models which resulted in the sales mix having a higher proportion
of new models than had been typical for October. BLS also reported that
while suggested retail prices for the 1967 models averaged $55 or 2.1
per cent higher than for the 1966 models, all but 0.2 per cent of the
increase was accounted for by quality improvements.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL SITUATION
Bank credit. Commercial bank credit is estimated to have
increased by $600 million in November, or at an annual rate of 2.3 per
cent following declines in October and September at annual rates of
2.3 per cent and 8.5 per cent. However, the late November Treasury
bill issue of $1.2 billion, payable by full tax and loan credit,
accounted for about one-third of the November increase, since banks
purchased essentially all of this issue, a good part of which they
still retained at month-end. For the three months, September-November,
bank credit declined at a 2.7 per cent annual rate, in sharp contrast
to the 8.4 per cent rate of increase recorded for the first 8 months
of the year.

Pressures on the banking system remained severe in November,
even though loan expansion was much more moderate than in October,
primarily because of further reductions in both private and U.S. Govern-
ment demand deposits. City banks also continued to lose time deposits.
As a result, banks liquidated $100 million of municipal and Federal
agency securities, and--despite the late November financing--added only
$200 million to their holdings of Treasury issues.
More banks--especially large ones--apparently have found it
necessary to obtain funds by relying more heavily on sales of other
securities. This was particularly noticeable at weekly reporting banks
during the 4 weeks ending November 23. In that period such banks
liquidated $900 million of municipal and agency securities and nearly
$200 million of U.S. Treasury issues, while their total loans declined
$20 million.
The increase of only $500 million in total loans at all
banks in November reflected a slowing in business loan expansion,
following the October spurt, and a continuing small increase in real
estate and consumer loans. All other loans in the aggregate showed
little net change. Limited availability of bank funds probably was the
major factor in the small increases in real estate loans, while weakness
in sales of new autos apparently contributed to the slowing of consumer
loan expansion. Security loans showed little change; while financing
needs of government security dealers moderated somewhat as the month
progressed--because of heavy System buying and strong investment demand
from public authorities and nonfinancial corporations--they rose again
at month-end to accommodate dealer positions in the new bills.

III -3
Business loans rose only $400 million in the month, somewhat
below the reduced rates of the 2 preceding months. The continuing
slowdown is associated evidently with both the limited supply of bank
funds and some reduction in business demand for bank credit. On the
supply side, deposit losses have compelled banks to enforce more strin-
gent lending standards. On the other hand, the fact that moderation in
loan expansion is quite widespread among industries, with transport
equipment a notable exception, suggests that slowing of demand may also
have been a factor. Of particular interest is the weakness in trade
loans, since these loans are closely related to trade inventories.
Bank response to recent Federal Reserve efforts to encourage
curtailment of business loan expansion has varied. Among weekly
reporters, business loans at New York City banks--although expanding
less rapidly than in 1965-have been cut back much less than at weekly
reporters outside New York City, as shown in line 5 of the table follow-
ing. As a result, New York City banks' share of the increase in these
loans from mid-August to late November amounted to about 60 per cent,
compared with around 40 per cent for comparable periods of earlier
years.
Since New York City banks experienced about two-thirds of
the $3 billion CD runoff over this period (line 10), they had to make
sharp reductions in their nonbusiness loans (line 6) and in their hold-
ings of other securities (line 3) in order to maintain their business
loans. They also made substantial use of Euro-dollars (line 11). While
banks outside of New York cut back relatively more on their business

III -4
loans, they also relied heavily on liquidation of other loans and other
securities to meet deposit losses. Since business loans are relatively
more important to New York City banks than to all other weekly reporters--
as measured as a percentage of total loans and investments--these data
suggest that New York bank attached higher priority to accommodating
business loan demands than outside banks and paid a much higher price
to meet those demands. It might be noted that New York City banks hold
only about one-third of the business loans of all weekly reporting banks.

Bank deposits. Time and savings deposits at commercial banks
rose only $100 million during November, an annual rate of less than one
per cent. While this increase partially offsets October's 2.3 per cent
annual rate of decline, it fell far short of the 11 per cent rate of
increase in the first eight months of the year. Country banks--having
less interest sensitive customers--continue to do relatively well in
the time deposit market. Over the past 3 months time deposit growth at
these banks--though moderating somewhat--was still running at a 9 per
cent annual rate; at reserve city banks, however, time deposits have
declined at a 10 per cent annual rate, reflecting in large part CD run-
offs at New York and Chicago banks.
As shown in the table, weekly reporting banks continued to
lose total time and savings deposits in November, although at a some-
what reduced pace, especially after taking account of the normal
seasonal decline in time deposits other than CD's. With interest
rates on short-term Treasury bills falling below the 5-1/2 per cent
ceiling, the runoff of CD's in the four weeks ending November 23
slackened to $400 million, less than 40 per cent of the September-
October loss. New York City banks, which have highly interest-sensitive
depositors, accounted for nearly all of this loss, as other city banks
were better able to replace most of their maturities. Indeed, since
November 2, weekly reporters outside of New York have actually increased
their outstanding CD's by $40 million.

The outflow of savings deposits at city banks during November
continued to be more moderate than it had been following the March and
June interest crediting periods. This presumably reflected the smaller
residual of interest-sensitive funds remaining in passbook accounts and
the reduced attractiveness of time deposits in some areas following the
rate rollback. However, the decline in time deposits other than CD's--
a decline seasonally associated with Christmas Club maturities--was
larger than usual this year. Part of the runoffs in State and local
funds and in consumer-type time deposits, other than Christmas Club
accounts, were associated with continued transfer of funds to market
securities. The 5 per cent ceiling on time deposits with denominations
under $100,000 was evidently a contributory factor in some cases. A

III -7
discussion of time deposit behavior of those banks paying above 5 per
cent on consumer-type time deposits prior to late September, as well
as those banks which have been important issuers of CD's, can be found
in Appendix A.
The money stock declined $400 million further in November--
or at an annual rate of minus 2.8 per cent. Since March, the money
stock has remained virtually unchanged even though the volume of trans-
actions, as reflected by the volume of debits to demand deposit accounts,
increased at an annual rate of approximately 12 per cent at 224 Standard
Metropolitan Statistical Areas (excluding New York) between March and
October. However, since mid-summer both the volume of debits to demand
deposit accounts and demand deposit turnover at these areas declined
slightly, while the money stock was unchanged.
With Government expenditures continuing to expand and with
the legal debt limit imposing restrictions on new Treasury borrowing,
seasonally adjusted U.S. Government deposits at banks declined by
$600 million in November, to their lowest level of the year.
With city banks continuing to lose total private deposits,
and with Government deposits down sharply, large banks obtained net
$125 million of funds in the Euro-dollar market in November. However,
the flow of funds from this source was sharply reversed in the last 3
weeks, due, in part, to some window dressing operations by foreign banks.
Corporate and municipal bond markets. Yields on new corporate
and seasoned municipal bonds rose as much as 25 basis points during

III -8
November--erasing roughly half of their sharp September-October declines.
Recently, however, most new issues have been received quite well, in some
cases at lower yields, and yields on recently offered issues also have
edged lower in secondary markets. These tendencies developed even though
most of the heavy December calendar was yet to come. The stronger tone
among other things reflected recent money market evidence of reduced
Federal Reserve restraint.

In the municipal bond market late additions to the new issue
calendar boosted November volume nearly to the $1 billion total of a
year ago, and for December the estimated volume is $200 million larger

III -9
than last year--due chiefly to the Oklahoma Turnpike issue which was
marketed last week following several months of postponements.
While more than $50 million of smaller issues were deferred
because of high interest costs within the past two weeks, the Oklahoma
Turnpike issue sold out quickly and distribution of other recent offer-
ings has been quite successful. Strengthening of the municipal market
apparently reflects a presumption in market circles that the recent
moderation of monetary restraint will maintain the improved competitive
position of large bank CD's relative to Treasury bills, and thus make
banks a more positive factor in the demand for municipal bonds during
the months ahead.

Some of the influences accounting for the enlarged calendar
in the face of indicated slowing of corporate spending seem clear. Most
important, corporate outlays for types of investments typically financed
with security issues have continued to grow, whereas external financing
available to finance such outlays from other than public offerings--such
as term loans at banks and private placements with institutional investors--
have continued to shrink. In addition, the forward calendar of new issues
may have been augmented to some extent recently by corporations seeking
to anticipate heavy cash needs in the second quarter of 1967. In that
quarter advance payments due on corporate income taxes will rise to
50 per cent of estimated 1967 liabilities from the 24 per cent rate
applicable (to 1966 liabilities) in the second quarter of this year.
Among these influences continued increases in outlays on
fixed investment has probably had the greatest impact on financing.
While over-all corporate investment expenditures have been cut back
since mid-year, the decline has been concentrated in outlays for inven-
tories and multifamily and commercial construction which are more likely
to be financed with bank loans and mortgages than with security issues.
Plant and equipment outlays have continued to rise and are expected to
rise a little further in the first half of 1967. At the same time,
corporate internal funds have failed to grow (with further expansion
of capital consumption allowances about offsetting a down-trend in
retained earnings). Hence, it is not surprising that fixed investment
outlays have continued to require a large volume of security market
financing.

III -12
Stock market. Common stock prices--as measured by Standard
and Poor's composite index--have declined slightly in each of the past
three weeks. At 80.84 on December 6, the "500" index was almost 2 per
cent below its mid-November level, but remained 10 per cent above its
1966 low (October 7). In general, the whole period since late October
has been marked by moderate day-to-day price fluctuations within a
narrow range, reflecting prevailing cross-currents of uncertainty about
the business outlook, corporate profits, Federal spending and taxes.
In recent weeks, the volume of trading has been heavy,
averaging about 7.5 million shares daily, with the most active trading
tending to accompany price advances. Activity has been augmented by
year-end tax swapping. But November was nevertheless the third
successive month in which trading activity fell behind the 1965 pace.
The use of stock market credit by margin customers declined
slightly ($7 million) in October or measured by the NYSE margin panel.
While customers' net debit balances with NYSE member firms were
down considerably more--$186 million to less than $5.2 billion--this
was due chiefly to the technical influence of start selling. Record
short-selling in both September and October created a large volume of
credit entries of a bookkeeping nature which offset an equal amount of
debit balances.
Mortgage market developments. Fragmentary trade and press
reports during recent weeks suggest that there may have been some slight
improvement in the availability of mortgage funds, along with some

III -13
lessening of pressures to tighten loan terms. Comprehensive data on
mortgage flows and credit conditions are available only through
October, however, and these do not indicate any significant market
turn.
The number of offerings of Government-backed loans to the
Federal National Mortgage Association for purchase under its secondary
market operations did ease off somewhat in November, due partly to
a slowdown during Thanksgiving week. And the FNA also announced on
November 29 that it stands ready to issue $250 million in advance
mortgage commitments under the added $1 billion special assistance
authorization approved last fall. Under these commitments, FNMA will
agree to buy, at prices well above the current market, certain FHA and
VA 6 per cent mortgages on yet-to-be-started homes.
Coming at a time when home mortgage debt has been expanding
at a seasonally adjusted rate of around $2-1/2 billion per quarter,
infusion of an additional $250 million in FNMA's new commitments
promises a modest degree of near-term market support. Further support
will be provided by the just announced release of $500 million in
Federal Home Loan Bank funds to finance expansion of residential
lending by savings and loan associations. Together, however, these FNMA
and FHLB support actions could finance no more than 40,000 homes
which would probably be started over roughly the next 90 to 180 days,
depending on the speed that builders with developed land and construction
plans can complete the details of their financing arrangements.

III -14
In October, the cumulative effects of months of tight credit
on conventional home mortgage lending showed up in further year-over-
year reductions in average maturities, according to the FHLBB-FDIC series.
Average loan-to-price ratios were also lower, as loan amounts increased
less since last year than prices of new and existing homes being financed.
The tendency to ration available loans in favor of better-quality
collateral and lower-risk borrowers is suggested by the fact that
implied cash downpayments (purchase price less first-mortgage loan)
remained at or close to record amounts for this 4-year-old series.

Flows to intermediaries: Final data for October indicate
that net flows to savings and loan associations and mutual savings
banks were less favorable than preliminary reports had suggested. At
all insured associations (representing 96 per cent of industry
assets) there was a small net contraction of share capital rather
than a net gain as initially indicated. While this loss was con-
siderably smaller than many in the industry had feared, the algebraic
difference between October net flows this year and those of 1965
(see table) was nearly as large as the difference in April, and nearly
two-thirds as large as in July following the semi-annual interest
crediting date.
Net flows to mutual savings banks in October were also below
preliminary estimates which had been based on results for the New York
State banks alone. But when allowance is made for seasonal influences,
savings bank deposits grew at nearly a 7 per cent annual rate in
October, as compared with about a 5 per cent rate in August-September,
and a 4 per cent rate in the preceding seven months.

Data on November savings flows at the S&L's and savings
banks are still incomplete. But savings banks in New York State
alone experienced a net deposit inflow of $185 million, slightly
larger than in any other November. If savings banks outside New York
continue to fare less favorably, it would appear that November inflows
for the industry would total about $220 million, or 20 per cent less
than in November 1965.
As for savings and loan associations, a somewhat larger
than seasonal repayment of Home Loan Bank advances during November as
well as a substantial contra-seasonal increase in association deposits
at the Home Loan Banks indicate that the S&L's have experienced sufficient
net inflows to make progress in repaying advances and adding to
liquidity. Under recent FHLBB regulations, associations which have
received advances to meet withdrawals must repay these advances out of
any net expansion in share capital before making new loans; consequently
many associations have been limited to repayment flows in acquiring
new mortgages.
During October, in fact, the volume of new mortgage
acquisitions by insured S&L's dropped virtually to the same level
as repayment flows. At the least, this relationship suggests that
mortgage funds available from S&L's will not shrink further, it is
an industry "rule of thumb" that repayments are automatically
reinvested in mortgages, and although further net drains of share
capital are expected in the post-Christmas January reinvestment period

III -17
(following quarterly and semi-annual interest crediting in December),
these drains would be covered largely by FHLB advances.
FHLB funds provided to cover withdrawals in January would be
in addition to the $500 million of Federal Home Loan Bank credit released
this week for expansion purposes. These expansion advances will be
made available over a two to three month period. But their availability
will not alter existing policy requiring individual S&L's to repay
promptly their outstanding withdrawal advances as savings capital grows.
Looking beyond January, industry analysts are hoping for some
strengthening of the slight pick up in net savings flows which they
believe has already been occurring in November and December, Their
hopes reflect the fact that a sizeable number of associations (600 in
October and November) are experimenting with various types of certifi-
cate plans which appear to have been successful in attracting funds.
Also, they apparently hope that market rates will decline relative to
S&L rates in the period ahead.

U. S. Government securities market. Yields on Treasury
notes and bonds declined in late November and early December after
rising on balance since late October. Currently, yields on short- and
intermediate-term Government securities (including bills) are at, or
close to, their lowest levels of the fall months, but yields on long-
term bonds remain somewhat above their recent lows of late October.

There has been sizable market demand for Treasury coupon
issues in recent weeks, as measured by the decline in dealer holdings.
From their peak in early November, dealer positions in notes and bonds
due after 1-year have been reduced by about $300 million to their
current level of about $750 million. This demand has featured recent
large purchases of the new 5-3/8's of November 1971 by a major New York
City bank and by a turnpike authority.
Treasury bill rates declined sharply in the second half of
November when strong bill demand from private investors was supplemented
by large Desk purchases for System and foreign accounts. The dealers
also were able to find an improved availability of financing from cor-
porations, public funds, and banks around the country. New York banks
continued to post relatively high dealer lending rates, although these
rates declined from their peaks as November progressed. Additional
financing was provided in late November and early December as the Desk
made a sizable volume of repurchase agreements to meet seasonal reserve
needs.
The bill market steadied in early December, as demand tapered
off and dealers built up their inventories through large awards of
newly auctioned bills. However, the smaller than expected size of the
Treasury cash offering of June tax bills on December 6 ($800 million)
injected a positive note in the market.
As bill rates declined in recent weeks, the spread between
3-month and 6-month bill rates narrowed considerably and fell to less
than 10 basis points in late November. This spread compares with one

III -20
ranging from 25 to 50 basis points since mid-summer, and apparently
reflects market expectations of lessened pressures on bills rates in
the months ahead.
Yields on short-term debt instruments other than bills have
also been steady to slightly lower in recent weeks, as the table shows.

U.S. balance of payments. The October payments results were
somewhat more unfavorable than had been expected. There was a deficit
of $215 million on the official reserve transactions basis and a defi-
cit of $765 million on the liquidity basis, both without seasonal
adjustment. Weekly figures for November suggest a further small
official reserve transactions deficit and a fairly substantial (perhaps
$200 million) liquidity deficit in that month. Week-to-week payments
swings during November were very large, making it more than usually
difficult to estimate what the complete month-end statistics will
show when they become available.
For the first eleven months of the year, seasonally unadjusted,
there was a cumulative official settlements surplus of about $200 mil-
lion; the liquidity deficit (on the basis on which it will be published)
was probably somewhat more than $1-3/4 billion. There is still a large
margin of uncertainty attached to forecasts of the full year's results.
It is not yet known, for example, whether the U.K. Government will
make or waive its year-end debt payment (about $140 million). It is
uncertain whether a payment of $250 million expected in connection
with the German Offset Agreement will be received before the end of
the year. And it is not possible to predict with any accuracy the
effect of year-end window-dressing operations by banks (net of of-
ficial actions to moderate or offset these movements of funds). These
transactions, together with the results of the first eleven months,
probably imply a full-year liquidity deficit (published basis) in the

IV -2
range between $1-1/4 to $1-3/4 billion and an official settlements
balance not far from zero.
Liabilities of U.S. banks to their overseas branches showed
very large weekly fluctuations in November. For example, they rose
by $280 million in the week ending November 23 (the day before
Thanksgiving) but fell by $480 million in the week ending November 30.
Probably part of this swing was due to very short-run loans of dollars
by foreigners to the foreign branches over the long holiday weekend
(the so-called "Thursday-Friday" transactions), and it is not impossible
that U.S. lenders may have similarly advanced funds via the Euro-dollar
market. Taking October and November together, the net increase in
liabilities due to branches abroad appears to be about $400 million;
for the eleven months the increase was $2-1/2 billion,
The trade balance recovered in October to a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of about $4 billion after averaging just under
$3 billion in the third quarter. Exports advanced sharply while imports
rose at a relatively modest pace.
Exports rose by 9 per cent between the third quarter of 1965
and the third quarter of 1966, but in October alone they advanced by
5-1/2 per cent over the third quarter average. This expansion con-
sisted entirely of non-agricultural commodities; agricultural exports
had already risen sharply after mid-year and in October were not much
changed. Little information is available about the components of non-
agricultural exports on a seasonally adjusted basis, but about one-
fifth of the increase appears to have consisted of new aircraft.

IV -3
Imports, which had expanded by 20 per cent between the third
quarters of 1965 and 1966, rose further by 1-1/2 per cent in October.
Imports of petroleum, steel and sugar declined slightly from their
third quarter levels. These commodities had accounted for more than
one third of the rise in imports from the second to the third quarters.
Outstanding claims on foreigners reported by banks, seasonally
unadjusted, were about unchanged in October: a small reflow of long-
term credits was matched by a small outflow of short-term credits.
Outflows of bank credit, particularly on short-term, tend to be
seasonally high in the fourth quarter. New issues of foreign securi-
ties (less foreign participation) have been running in the fourth
quarter at about the same level or a little less than in the third
quarter (about $300 million seasonally adjusted). New issues for the
full year are expected to be about $1.2 billion.

IV -4
Industrial production abroad
Except in France, Italy, and Japan, a marked and widespread
tendency is now evident for the expansion of industrial activity abroad
to slacken or give place to contraction. Statistics of monthly production
indicate that this change was occurring during the second and third quarters
of 1966. Nevertheless, in monetary terms, GNP expenditures have still been
increasing briskly in most countries. Even in Britain, where real GNP has
been declining since midyear, current-value GNP may still have been rising
a little.
In view of the 3-1/2 year length of the upswing in all industrial
countries except Japan, France, and Italy, and in view of the very tight
monetary policies that have been used to damp the inflationary pressures,
it is not surprising that a common feature in the slowdowns that have
occurred has been a slowing in growth, or even a decline, in private fixed
capital and residential construction expenditures. (Inventory investment
may also have slackened this summer and autumn, but relevant data are
hard to come by.) Public investment outlays, on the other hand, continue
to increase, though in Germany and the Netherlands their growth is limited
by financing difficulties imposed by tight money and (in the Netherlands)
by administrative regulations.
For the OECD European countries taken together, industrial pro-
duction was at the same level in July-August as in the second quarter, and
probably declined in September. Data for September are available for
Germany, Britain, and France, with a combined weight of two-thirds of
OECD European output. In September, German output declined for the third

IV -5
month in a row. British industrial production also dropped in.September
and other indicators suggest that it has declined further since then.
In several other countries, including Sweden, Austria, and
Belgium, industrial production was below second-quarter averages in July-
August (latest). This was the case also in the Netherlands, but other
evidence suggests that in that country the third quarter as a whole may
show no decline.

IV -6
Of the European OECD countries, only France and Italy had
further expansion in industrial production after midyear. French in-
dustrial production as presently adjusted for seasonality was unchanged
in September, but with proper allowance for changing seasonals the in-
dex might have risen further. Outside Europe, rapid expansion has con-
tinued in Japan, while in Canada output remained last summer on the
plateau reached in March.
In Britain, recent production and employment changes, taken
with other evidence, indicate that the economy has moved into a period
of recession. Seasonally adjusted unemployment increased in November
for the sixth month in succession -- with sharper increases beginning in
September than had occurred earlier. The seasonally adjusted number
wholly unemployed in November (excluding school-leavers) was 423,000, up
more than 50 per cent from the February-May low average of 277,000.
The September decline in industrial production, by 3 per cent,
was especially marked in the engineering and allied industries. In
October there was a further decline in passenger car output (which has
been affected by strikes) and seasonally adjusted steel production also
fell -- by 2.5 per cent, to a level about 5 per cent below October of
last year.
Investment surveys by the Confederation of British Industry
and the Board of Trade earlier this fall indicated substantial cut-
backs in planned investment in 1967; the Board of Trade survey pointed
to a 7 or 8 per cent decline from 1966 to 1967 in capital outlays by
manufacturing industry valued at constant prices. Weakness persists in

IV -7
private residential construction. Activity in this field has been on a
declining trend since late 1964 and is generally thought to be still
falling, though seasonally adjusted statistics are not available beyond
the second quarter (when there was a slight pick-up after the very sharp
first-quarter drop). The government has predicted that its 1966 goal
of 400,000 new dwelling units will not be met, and that total completions,
private and public, will probably total 380,000 or the same as last year.
In Germany, signs of weaker domestic demand have been increasing-
ly evident since about mid-year. By September industrial production had
fallen 5 per cent below the March-June high. The decline was widespread
among industries, affecting capital goods, consumer goods, and materials.
Total new orders received by manufacturers fell sharply between
March and the third quarter. Since May new orders have been running below
shipments, so that backlogs of unfilled orders are shrinking. Rapid in-
creases in new foreign orders through the second quarter partly offset
the decline in domestic demand. There was no further advance in the
third quarter, but new foreign orders in that period were 12 per cent higher
than a year earlier.
Unemployment remains very low in Germany, but has been rising
since mid-year. A sharp increase occurred in November.
The German money market has been eased somewhat since mid-year
by the improvement in bank liquidity arising from the favorable balance
of payments, and indications are that the balance of payments will re-
main in surplus. However, the Bundesbank at the beginning of November
expressed the view that its policy should continue to aim at countering

IV -8
inflationary dangers. Despite the new measures the Bundesbank took
on December 1, its policy stance has not altered greatly over the past
month.
The December 1 actions appear to have had two objectives. One
is to induce the large German banks to hold more of their increasing
liquid assets in domestic securities rather than abroad. To do this,
the regulations affecting reserve requirements against the banks' foreign
liabilities are being changed. The minimum ratios -- 20 per cent against
time liabilities to foreigners and 30 per cent for demand liabilities,--
are to apply next year to total foreign liabilities rather than only to
net liabilities as at present. This will alter the incentives for plac-
ing funds abroad.
An initial effect of this action on the banks' total liquidity
(apart from the continuing effects of net acquisitions of foreign ex-
change by the central bank and commercial banks combined) is contractionary.
The Bundesbank's second action had the purpose of offsetting at least in
part this contractionary effect: the Bundesbank will keep in force after
the year-end the cut of one-eleventh in the ordinary reserve requirements
against domestic liabilities -- a cut which is presently in effect as a
temporary seasonal measure for the month of December only.
Industrial production has leveled off in a number of the smaller
European countries. In Austria, domestic demand conditions appear general-
ly satisfactory but the rising share of imports in domestic sales and the
scanty growth in export sales have been reflected in a loss of momentum
for industrial output. In Sweden, the economy is still reacting to

IV -9
restrictive measures taken to moderate the severely overheated conditions
of 1965 -- measures which helped to slow the expansion of industrial out-
put from mid-1965 on. However, investment demand revived last spring,
and demand for the highly specialized output of the export-oriented en-
gineering branches has held up well. A sharp drop in residential con-
struction this year has led to a decline in production of building materials.
In the Netherlands, industrial production in July-August was
7 per cent above the corresponding period in 1965, and it is not at all
clear that its slight decline from the second quarter of this year marks
a definite change of trend. Although domestic demand has been weakening
somewhat, the inflow of new foreign orders has been strong enough to
sustain the rising trend of total unfilled orders.
In Canada, industrial production has shown some signs of softness
since the spring, and industrial output appears to have reached a plateau.
The index peaked in April and declined for the next three months. Pro-
duction turned up again in August, but this may reflect an earlier than
usual start of new model auto production. The decline in production from
April to July was concentrated in durables manufacturing and steel, and
the development appears to have reflected weaker demand conditions
especially for consumer household durables and automobiles. Output of
machinery and heavy electrical equipment has no longer been increasing
since February or March, but through August was off only slightly. Out-
put of construction materials fell by 6 per cent from February through
August.

IV -10
In the general picture of more moderate production gains
or of recessions, the three notable exceptions are Japan, Italy, France.
In Japan, industrial production continued to rise through
September at a substantial pace. Output has been rising pretty steadily
since a low was reached in October of last year, and the 11-month in-
crease has been 17 per cent.
Comparing August-September with the corresponding period in
1965, the most rapid gains have been in output of intermediate goods
(up 20 per cent) and of durable consumer goods (up 23 per cent). The in-
creases for the other three sectors have been lower: non-durable consumer
goods (9 per cent -- but in this field there had been no slowing in 1965);
construction materials (12 per cent); and final-demand capital goods (11
per cent). The upturn in production of capital goods did not occur until
May of this year; since then, advance has been rapid.
The level of outstanding orders for machinery, seasonally ad-
justed, has been rising since June 1965, and in August was 12 per cent
higher than a year earlier. New orders received in September were 14 per
cent higher than a year earlier.
In Italy, vigorous output expansion has been the rule this
year in most sectors of industry. Construction activity has been de-
pressed, but even in this sector demand has been moving up in 1966.
Italian industrial production in June-July was 11 per cent
higher than a year earlier. Consumer goods production has been in-
creasing rapidly, in response to both domestic and export demand. An
increase of 6 per cent in "investment goods" output (including steel)
would probably have been greater but for widespread work stoppages that

IV -11
plagued the metallurgical and engineering industries between February
and July. The sharpest rise in the year to June-July was in "industrial
materials," with a 14 per cent advance; this group includes petroleum
refining, chemicals, and electricity, all having strong secular growth
trends.
According to Italian officials, the recent flood damages will
not significantly reduce the rate of economic growth next year; their
estimate in September was that real GNP would increase from 1966 to 1967
by 5-1/2 per cent. Government expenditures for flood damage repairs
are being financed in part by special tax increases.
In France, 1966 has seen a sustained advance in industrial
production under the influence of rapidly rising domestic demand, des-
pite some weakening in foreign demand for French exports. The rise in
industrial production from the third quarter of 1965 to the third quarter
of 1966 was 7 per cent.
The pick-up in business fixed investment outlays has especially
benefitted the equipment industries, as can be seen in the 7 per cent
gain in output of the "metals transformation" branches, which, however,
also include automobiles and some steel mill products in addition to
equipment. Passenger car production rose rapidly in the autumn and
winter of 1965-66, but then flattened out in the period February through
September. A number of other consumer-oriented branches of industry
have shown large output gains: in the third quarter, textile output
was up 11 per cent from a year earlier, leather production by 9 per cent,
paper output by 12 per cent, and printing-publishing by 17 per cent.

IV -12
Weak sectors in French industrial production this year have
been steel and construction materials, both showing very small changes
since the third quarter of 1965.

APPENDIX A: SURVEILLANCE PROGRAM OF BANKS MOST AFFECTED BY REGULATION Q CEILINGS*
In order to determine the effect of the September 21 roll-
back of the rate ceiling on time deposits of less than $100,000 and
the general impact of higher market yields on large denomination
negotiable certificates of deposit, the Division of Research and
Statistics has initiated a special surveillance program. The 300
banks under review are those which were paying over 5 per cent on
consumer time deposits at the time of the September 21 rollback and
weekly reporters with outstanding large denomination CD's in excess
of 10 per cent of total deposits as of the August CD maturity survey.
Included in the consumer time deposit group are all banks showing rates
above 5 per cent on such deposits in the May 11 survey plus 66 banks
that were reported by Reserve Banks to have raised consumer time deposit
rates above 5 per cent between May 11 and September 21.
Results thus far in the survey suggest the following:
1. Big bank losses of time deposits have been mainly
caused by declines in large denomination CD's;
2. At small banks the effect of the rate rollback
has been to halt the growth in time deposits for
these banks. While the totals for these banks
suggest no loss of time deposits, the lack of
expansion of their deposits is in sharp contrast
to the rapid expansion for these banks over the
year ending June 1966;
3. The only noticeable portfolio change among banks
in the surveillance is that banks losing CD's have
sharply reduced holdings of U. S. Government and
other securities.
Characteristics of Banks Reviewed
Over half the banks under review are located in the West--
in the Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts--with the
remaining bulk in the Northeast and Chicago areas, as shown in Table 1.
Of the 257 banks affected by the rollback, about two-thirds are small
banks (having deposits of less than $100 million), and 72 of these

have been chartered since the beginning of 1963. About 80 per cent
of these newly chartered banks are in western districts, mainly in
the States of California, Texas, Wyoming, and Collorado.

on consumer time deposits and are counted only once in total.
Approximately one-half of the 300 surveillance banks have
deposits of less than $100 million and about one-tenth have deposits in
excess of $1 billion, as shown in Table 2. More than one-fourth of
the banks with high CD ratios have over $1 billion in deposits.

Banks in the surveillance had been extremely successful in
attracting time deposits between mid-1965 and mid-1966, as shown in
Table 3. This was particularly true for the newly chartered banks,
whose time deposits almost doubled over this period. In contrast,
such deposits at all country banks rose only 12 per cent and those
at older surveillance banks with deposits under $100 million rose
25 per cent.

Deposit and Portfolio Changes
As indicated in Table 4, the weekly reporting banks in the
survey experienced sharp declines in total time and savings deposits
during October and early November, while such deposits at the smaller,
nonweekly reporting banks under review showed little change. Reductions
at large banks, however, were mainly the result of CD run-offs, which
is not surprising since the surveillance banks account for 90 per cent
of all large negotiable CD's outstanding. Changes in other types of
time deposits at weekly reporters in the survey differed little from
those at other weekly reporting banks. Sizeable security liquidations
accompanied CD run-offs, but the difference between changes in business
loans at surveyed and other weekly reporters appears insignificant.
Nonweekly reporters in the survey showed little variation
from all country banks--the most comparable control group--with one
notable exception. Nonpassbook time deposits at small banks which had

A- 5
been paying in excess of 5 per cent on time deposits of less than
$100,000 slowed while those at country banks continued to increase.
This occurrence is a sharp reversal of the trend which had been
established prior to the rollback, which suggests that many of the
smaller banks surveyed had been able to attract deposits by paying
relatively high rates and are failing to expand these deposits when
forced to offer rates more in line with competitive institutions and
below some market rates.

Reflecting their heavy concentrations of outstanding CD's,
the New York, Chicago, and San Francisco Districts had the largest numbers
of weekly reporting banks showing declines in total time and savings
deposits over the period surveyed. Among nonweekly reporters,
Atlanta and San Francisco ranked highest in the number of deposit-
losing banks, and these banks were heavily concentrated in the States
of Florida and California, where competition from nonbank savings
institutions is intense.
Of the total of 127 deposit-losing banks, less than a
fourth had decreases in excess of 5 per cent--19 weekly reporters
and 10 nonweekly reporters. In the case of the weekly reporters,
all but 4 had CD run-offs of 15 per cent or more. Among the 10
nonweekly reporters, the decreases in nonpassbook time deposits
ranged between 7 and 47 per cent. Relative to the number of banks
in the two surveillance groups, however, the proportion of the
smaller nonweekly banks experiencing large time deposit declines was
relatively small, suggesting that customers at these banks are much
less interest-sensitive than those of larger banks.
Tabulations are in process on the borrowings of banks in
the surveillance, and an analysis will be made available as soon as
the data are completed.
