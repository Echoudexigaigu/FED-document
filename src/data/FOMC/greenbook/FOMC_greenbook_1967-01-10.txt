SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK
Outlook for GNP
GNP for the fourth quarter is now estimated to show a
larger increase than was projected four weeks ago because inventory
accumulation was much larger than previously indicated. At the same
time new evidence now becoming available shows less strength in retail
sales than estimated earlier. Estimates of defense spending for both
quarters are somewhat lower than those presented in the last Greenbook
because of later information for the fourth quarter. Over-all, GNP is
projected as rising only $7 billion in the current quarter, as compared
with $14 billion in the fourth. In real terms, the rise is estimated
to be at an annual rate of about 1.5 per cent in the present quarter.
The fourth quarter inventory bulge -- associated as it was
with little, if any, further increase in real consumer takings of goods,
another large cut in construction activity, and the slowing in expansion
now evident in the equipment sector -- must largely represent involuntary
accumulation of stocks which should lead to adjustments of production
schedules shortly. Cutbacks in output instituted earlier in construction-
related industries and recently in major consumer durable goods
industries already have led to reduced output of some materials. More
widespread or deeper cutbacks in consumer lines are probably now in
order, along with further slowing of expansion in the equipment sector.
Under these circumstances, the prospect is for some decline in industrial
production in the current quarter.

1 -2
In a broad sense, inventory accumulation has been excessive
since early last spring -- particularly for durable goods -- and stock-
sales rations have risen substantially from the low levels prevailing
earlier. The rate of accumulation now projected for the first quarter
of 1967 for nonfarm business is still as large as in early 1966, and
would not likely result in any decline in stock-sales ratios. Conse-
quently, business generally may be expected to continue efforts to
curtail inventory additions. Such an adjustment, through its effects
on industrial production, can be expected to slow the rise in incomes
and to moderate further the rise in consumer spending; in addition, it
may weaken further business incentives to expand or maintain investment
fixed capital.
Prices and resource use
Crosscurrents in demands and output in recent months have
resulted in virtually no net change in the index of industrial produc-
tion between August and December. Given the excessive level of stocks,
near-term prospects in many industries are for output to remain at
somewhat reduced levels or to decline. With capacity generally con-
tinuing to increase, reductions in output-capacity ratios are in prospect.
While indications of layoffs and cutbacks in the workweek
are few and labor markets remain generally tight, there are some signs
of softening, such as in the recent more than seasonal rise in unemploy-
ment claims.
With output levelling off and manhours continuing upward in
recent months, productivity growth has slowed and labor costs per unit

1-3
of output have risen. But with product markets less strong it will be
more difficult to raise prices. As a result, efforts to protect profit
margins are likely to focus on holding down cost increases. Thus, even
with somewhat larger wage settlements in the months ahead, the average
rise in industrial commodity prices may remain limited. The rise over
the past year has amounted to 2 per cent, with the largest increases
among machinery and equipment.
The outlook for farm and food prices is mixed. For grains,
increases in acreage allotments could bring enough expansion in produc-
tion to weaken prices, but that would have little impact on consumer
prices for foods. Prospects are for smaller market supplies of beef
this year but for larger supplies of pork, poultry, and eggs. If
retail food prices rise at all, apart from seasonal movements, the rate
of increase is likely to be far below that in 1965 and most of 1966.
However, the recent declines in prices of foodstuffs at both wholesale
and retail are believed to be about over and, thus, this offset to
higher industrial and service prices can no longer be counted on.
Supply and demand at commercial banks
The supply of deposits at commercial banks increased markedly
in December, with both demand and time deposit growing. Total deposits
are likely to continue rising, at least by moderate amoungs, in the
weeks immediately ahead. At current levels of interest rates, banks
may be able to continue adding moderately to outstanding large CD's and
to compete relatively successfully for consumer savings. Banks were

I-4
able to add a very small amount to their outstanding CD's during
December, but it is very likely that the maturities on their record
sales during the month were generally quite short. Thus, banks will
be faced with a continuing problem of rolling over heavy maturities in
the weeks ahead.
In the degree that banks continue to have a large burden of
maturing CD's and until they are quite certain about their ability to
roll them over, they are likely to move slowly in changing their loan
policies. Rescission of the September 1 letter may have indicated to
banks that funds will be more generally available in the period ahead,
but most major banks will probably be awaiting confirming developments
as seen in the Federal funds rate and the continued availability of CD
money before making any basic loan policy changes.
The inclination of banks to move toward less restrictive
lending policies would be encouraged not only by indications of a
greater supply of funds but also by any continuation of recent diminished
loan demands. The almost negligible business loan expansion of the past
two months and bankers' reports in the December 15 lending practices
survey suggest some reduction in demand. The December expansion in
total bank credit was almost wholly accounted for by additions to
U.S. Government security holdings and loans to security dealers.
Still, business loan expansion may pick up in the weeks
ahead as compared with the pace of the past two months. Large accel-
erated payments by corporations of withheld individual income and social
security taxes in January will be a factor. Also, it is likely that any

I-5
gradual relaxation of banks' lending policies will encourage some
additional business borrowing from banks, partly because projected
capital spending programs imply a continued need for external financing,
including term loans from banks. However, the prospect that businesses
will be sharply reducing inventory accumulation over the months ahead
suggests that there will be no strong sustained resurgence of business
loan demand, although there amy be periods of heavy demand associated
with tax payments.
Banks are likely to continue rebuilding their U.S. Government
securities portfolios in the period ahead. And they should be a positive
factor in the municipal market, all-assuming CD money continues to be
in reasonably good supply and business loans do not expand sharply.
Capital markets
The viability of the reduced levels of bond yields resulting
from the sharp decline last month will be tested by the large volume of
new securities scheduled for offering in January. Taxable securities
offered during that period will total about $1.5 billion, two-fifths
of which represents Federal participation certificates; tax-exempt
issues will amount to more than $1 billion. And the supply of corporate
securities on the horizon after January also appears to be building up.
It is possible that the December yield declines may have
overdiscounted the present strength of market forces leading to lower
rates. Also, some of the long-term funds that normally come available
early in a new year may have already been committed. As a result, the
downward tendency of interest rates could be slowed or temporarily

1- 6
halted in the process of marketing forthcoming issues -- barring budget
surprises of more than expected fiscal restraint and assuming no intensi-
fication of market expectations as to the likely degree of monetary ease.
The Treasury will announce its February refunding toward the
end of January. While this refunding is expected to be fairly routine,
U.S. Government security dealers do hold a very large inventory of
securities in all maturity areas at the moment. This could tend to
limit their participation in the new issue(s) and make them less willing
holders of existing issues, especially if their borrowing costs remain
relatively high and if the Federal budget implies less than expected
net debt repayment in the first half of 1967.
The tone of mortgage markets has improved recently, although
the latest data (as of November) do not yet show an easing of mortgage
rates and other terms. The improved atmosphere is based largely upon
expectations that recent increases of savings flows to major types of
mortgage lenders will soon be reflected in expanded new loan commitments.
But because mortgage lenders have first taken steps to improve their own
liquidity, new mortgage loan activity has not yet expanded appreciably.
Balance of payments
In October-November, the advance in merchandise imports
slackened while exports continued to increase, and the annual rate of
trade surplus was about $3/4 billion larger than in the third quarter.
The favorable turn in the trade balance was more than offset, however,
by unfavorable developments in other transactions. The over-all
deficit on the liquidity basis appears to have approached $1 billion

I- 7
(quarterly rate) in the fourth quarter, despite special receipts of
nearly $1/2 billion from Germany at year-end; and the balance on the
official reserve transactions basis reverted to deficit, even though
inflows of foreign private liquid funds remained large.
Only a small part of the deterioration in non-trade trans-
actions can yet be identified. There was a renewed outflow of bank-
reported capital in October-November, even after rough allowanc for
seasonality, in contrast to the third-quarter inflow. But there must
also have been a substantial worsening on some of the items for which
no data are yet available -- other private capital, Government grants
and credits, military transactions, and service transations. Some part
of the deterioration may prove unexplainable and show up in the residual
errors and omissions item; this item showed an unusual plus in the third
quarter.
In the months ahead, the trade balance should continue to
improve. Weakening of demand in Britain, Germany, and Canada may slow
the export advance but seems unlikely to halt it, given the continued
strength of demand in Japan, France, Italy, and a large number of non-
industrial countries. Meanwhile, imports are likely to level off as
domestic inventory accumulation slackens and the boom in capital
equipment subsides.
The outlook for capital flows is highly uncertain, but there
will probably be four adverse tendencies to reckon with. (1) The
inflow of liquid funds through foreign branches of U.S. banks is likely
to diminish sharply as domestic credit conditions ease. (2) There is

1-8
likely to be an outflow of U.S. bank credit. (3) Receipts under
military offset arrangements with Germany will probably be significantly
smaller than in 1966. (4) It may be difficult to arrange new shifts of
funds by foreign official and international institutions from liquid to
nonliquid U.S. assets on the massive 1966 scale.
The net result of these adverse tendencies and of the improve-
ment in the trade balance is likely to be a liquidity deficit running
above a $2 billion annual rate in the months ahead. And the official
settlements deficit, which will be particularly affected by a change in
inflows of foreign private liquid funds, may be about as large as the
liquidity deficit, in marked contrast to the 1966 experience.
Perhaps only a small portion of the deficit in coming months
will have to be settled in gold or in currencies drawn from the IMF.
Seasonal factors will be favorable, some reserve gaining countries
(e.g. Germany) may be willing to add to their holdings of dollars or
Roosa bonds, and Britain will be repaying swaps. But later if Britain
gains sufficient reserves to make its scheduled $1 billion repayment to
the IMF, it will have to draw upon U.S. reserve assets to do so unless
another technique can be found; the Fund cannot accept repayment in U.S.
dollars when the United States is a debtor of the Fund.

SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK
Gross national product. The pattern of GNP developments now
envisaged for the fourth and first quarters differs in some major respects
from that presented in the Green Book four weeks ago.
In the fourth quarter, more recent evidence--particularly on
retail sales--has resulted in a further lowering of the rise estimated
for total final sales (gross national expenditures less outlays to
build up inventories). The rise in final sales was reduced in our
successive fourth quarter projections beginning in late October, as
evidence developed on slackening of expansion in consumer spending and
business fixed investment and on deepening of the decline in residen-
tial construction; now--with the increase in defense spending also
reduced from earlier estimates--the rise in final sales appears to
have been considerably smaller than in the third quarter. On the other
hand--despite recent production cutbacks instituted in major durable
goods lines to halt the rise in stocks--over-all inventory accumulation
apparently bulged sharply in the fourth quarter. The result is that
GNP is now estimated to have increased $14 billion to a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of $758.5 billion ($2 billion higher than the
estimate of four weeks ago).
With inventories too high relative to current and prospective
sales--chiefly in the durable goods sector--additional production cut-
backs are expected to result in a sharp drop in the rate of inventory
accumulation in the first quarter. This drop would act as a major

II- 2
offset to a projected further rise in final sales and GNP is projected
as rising only $7 billion further, to $765.5 billion. In real terms,
growth in the first quarter would be at an annual rate of only 1.5 per
cent, as compared with 4 per cent in the second half of 1966, and the
unemployment rate is expected to rise moderately. Even with the pro-
jected drop in the rate of inventory accumulation, stocks at the end
of the first quarter would still be high relative to sales and if
sales are not stimulated by, say, a pick-up in defense outlay or in
consumer willingness to spend, further inventory liquidation into the
spring is likely.
Retail sales, which had been about unchanged from August to
October, declined slightly in November, In December, according to
weekly data, they may have recovered some or most of the decline of
the preceding month--but for the entire fourth quarter they showed
only a fractional increase. New domestic auto sales were down mod-
erately for the quarter and sales of some major household durable
goods have weakened recently. Altogether, dollar consumption
expenditures for goods showed little, if any, more rise than prices
of consumer goods. Dollar service outlays continued to expand rapidly,
with price increases--now at the fastest pace since 1946--accounting
for a major part of this increase.
The rise in consumer income in the fourth quarter exceeded
the apparent increase in consumer spending, and the saving rate
is indicated to have risen moderately from the low third quarter
rate, though still continuing below normal levels, In the first

II-3
quarter, the rise in consumer income is expected to slow, as expansion
in employment and wages and salaries is retarded by slackening indus-
trial activity associated with the inventory adjustment, and as a
small further increase in the social security tax takes effect. This
slowing in turn is expected to act to limit further the rise in
consumer spending.
The recent lag in consumer spending reflects such influences
as the sharp and prolonged rise in prices for goods and services,
which has served to squeeze funds for the more postponable purchases, the
more restricted availability of consumer credit--including mortgage
credit used for consumption purposes--the effect of the sharp drop
in housing transactions on demand for household durables, and a growing
feeling of uncertainty about the future evidenced by the large
and progressive decline over the past year in consumer "sentiment"
as measured by the Michigan Survey Research Center Index, Moreover,
while personal income rose at a fast pace throughout most of 1966, a
significant portion of this rise was absorbed in sharply stepped-up
personal tax payments.
The moderate rise in business fixed investment now estimated
for the fourth and first quarters is based essentially on the findings
of the latest Co.mmerce-SEC plant and equipment survey, which was con-
ducted in late October and November. That survey showed the first sig-
nificant shortfall from preceding survey estimates since 1963 and it
projected a very slow rate of expansion in the first half of this year.

II-4
Although order backlogs in the machinery and equipment industries
were continuing to rise in October and November, new orders were
down and the rise in the backlog appeared to be tapering off.
Meanwhile, factory shipments of machinery and equipment have been
showing little change since midyear, and this may suggest a smaller
rise in business equipment outlays than was indicated by the Commerce-
SEC survey, Further downward adjustment of business capital invest-
ment programs, particularly for capacity expansion, may also develop
as the increase in over-all output slows markedly during the course
of the large decline in the rate of inventory accumulation now pro-
jected as beginning in the current quarter.
Defense purchases of goods and services--according to limited
information available--remains a major (perhaps the major) expansive
element in the GNP outlook. But the rate of increase, which reached
a peak $4.2 billion rate in the third quarter, receded to an estimated
$2.8 billion in the fourth quarter and is now projected at $2.5 billion
in the first quarter, based on the latest information we can obtain
from the Budget Bureau. New orders for defense-type products dropped
off sharply in October and November and while the order backlog
remained very large, the main expansive impact of defense on production--
including the materials and equipment build-up--and employment may
already have taken place.
Residential construction now represents a comparatively
favorable element in the outlook, in the sense that the sharp curtail-
ment that began last spring probably is about over. Following

II-5
declines at the rate of about $5 billion in each of the third
and fourth quarters, we are now projecting a further decrease of
only $0.4 billion in the first quarter. Easing of monetary policy,
a resumption of inflows to the savings institutions, and an apparent
weakening in business and consumer credit demands appear to be
bringing some improvement in the supply of funds available for
mortgages. There may well be a considerable lag, however, before
any significant pick-up occurs in residential building activity.
The sharp bulge in inventory accumulation--from a rate of
$9.9 billion in the third quarter to an estimated $13.5 billion in
the fourth quarter--was a compound of a moderate step-up in the book
value increase for nonfarm business and a large upward shift in the
GNP "inventory valuation adjustment." In the GNP accounts, the
inventory item is defined as the change in the physical volume of
inventories during the quarter with the change valued at average
(inventory) prices for the quarter. During the first three quarters
of 1966, the book value increases incorporated large gains in prices
and substantial downward adjustments were applied to the book value
increases in calculating the GNP inventory change. In the fourth
quarter, however, as a result of declines in prices of foodstuffs,
fibers and some other materials and the marked slowing of the rise
in prices of industrial commodities, the book value increase over
the quarter is estimated on net to have included a slight decline
in over-all (inventory) prices.

1-6
In the first quarter with little change now estimated for
the inventory valuation adjustment, inventory accumulation is pro-
jected at an $8.5 billion rate, down $5 billion from the fourth
quarter. This drop is expected to come from a marked slowing of
the rate of accumulation in both manufacturing and trade--with
possible decumulation taking place for some consumer goods and materials.
The rate projected for the first quarter is expected to halt the rise
in stock-sales ratios which began last spring.

II -8
Industrial production. Industrial production in December
is expected to change little from the November level of 158 per cent
of the 1957-59 average. Anticipated declines in output of some
consumer goods may be offset by a further rise in business and defense
equipment. Output of durable goods materials, however, is expected
to decline further.
Auto assemblies in December were unchanged from the November
annual rate of 8.5 million units but were 8.5 per cent below a year
earlier. In early December output of color television sets reached
a new high but that of monochrome sets declined further, Truck
production, despite trade reports of some softening in demand, con-
tinued at high rates in December. Steel ingot production declined
further, and there was some easing in output of paperboard. Output
of crude petroleum and refined petroleum products, however, were at
record levels.
In the first nine months of 1966, industrial production
rose at an annual rate of 9 per cent and in August was 158.0 per
cent of the 1957-59 average. Since then the total index has changed
little, although tending slightly downwards during the last quarter
of the year. Curtailments in output in some industries, mainly autos,
steel, and construction materials, burdened by large inventories and
declining demands, offset continued gains in others. There also have
been some selective adjustments in the textile and chemical industries,
centering in man-made yarns and fibers, and in some household appliances.

II -9
Output of business equipment rose further iri the last quarter
of the year, and at the end of November unfilled orders for machinery
and equipment were at record levels. However, new orders for trans-
portation equipment and all categories of electrical machinery,
except transmission and distribution equipment, declined in November.
Autos. Daily average sales of new domestic automobiles during
December were 6 per cent below a year ago, and 8 per cent below a month
ago. In terms of units, the seasonally adjusted annual rate for the
month was 8 million, compared to 8.4 million in November and 8.5 million
a year earlier.
Dealer stocks of new cars on December 20 were slightly above
the ending November level. For the month as a whole, stocks are
expected to show a somewhat more than seasonal rise. At the December
selling rate, inventories representa 52 day supply, considerably
above the longer-run relation to sales.
For the calendar year as a whole, sales of domestic new
cars totaled 8.4 million units, moderately less than the 8.8 million
units sold in calendar year 1965, but substantially ahead of the
7.6 million in 1964. Including imports, total sales of new cars in
1966 reached 9 million units, somewhat less than the record 9.3
million units sold in 1965.
Present industry assembly schedules call for first quarter
1967 output at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 8.0 million
units, approximately 10 per cent below the number of units assembled
in the first quarter of 1966. With sales now expected to be a little

II -10
higher than scheduled production, seasonally adjusted stocks would
decline slightly. On an unadjusted basis, however, the number of
units in inventory would rise to about 1.7 million at the end of
March as compared with 1.4 million in late December.
Consumer credit. Instalment credit expansion increased in
November to $444 million, up from a very low $380 million in October,
but still less than in any other month in the last two years.
The increase was most noticeable in the auto area and
reflected not only increased sales of new cars but also a rise in
the proportion of cars bought on credit and in the size of the average
instalment contract. The average new car note has risen well over
$100 since the introduction of 1967 models, partly because of higher
list prices and partly because consumers are continuing to upgrade the
models and options purchased.
The increase in consumer instalment debt for the year as
a whole is estimated at $6.5 billion, about 15 per cent less than
the record $8 billion for 1965. In 1965, both extensions and repay-
ments were in a vigorous uptrend, but in 1966, extensions leveled
off while repayments continued to rise.
The slower growth in outstanding auto credit this year
accounted for most of the difference in total instalment credit
growth. Thus, auto credit increases averaged less than $200 million
per month in 1966 as compared to over $300 million a month last year.
Expansion in personal loans and repair and modernization loans was
also less this year but some offset was provided by greater expansion
in credit in the other consumer goods category.

II -11
For this expansion period as a whole, the rise in instalment
credit extensions has not been as steep as in the upswings of 1954-57
and 1958-60. But credit extensions did move up for a much longer
period than in the two earlier expansions. In both of the earlier
upswings, new borrowing accelerated sharply at first, and then
leveled off, even though the upswing continued in general economic
activity. As of now, credit extensions have moved sidewise for almost
a year-.about the same length of time as preceded the downturn in
1961--but still much less than the 2-1/2 year leveling trend which
preceded the 1958 downturn.
Consumer attitudes and buying plans. According to the
survey conducted by the Michigan Survey Research Center in November-
December 1966, consumer sentiment--as measured by their special index
based on consumers' evaluation of their own and general business
conditions and prospects--has continued to deteriorate since August.
But the recent rate of decline has not been quite so pronounced as
it was earlier in the year. As the survey report rather encouragingly
puts it, "it would be incorrect to characterize the present state of
consumer attitudes as outright pessimisim."
Consumers continued to exhibit concern and uncertainty about
the effects of inflation, tight money, and high interest rates on
personal-financial, as well as general economic trends, despite the
fact that the proportion of family units reporting having made more
money than a year ago remained at a record level, As also reported

II -12
in the Census survey--taken a month or more before the Michigan Survey--
buying plans for autos were down significantly from the record year-
earlier levels, but, in contrast to the Census survey, the Michigan
Survey found no decline in intentions to buy major household durable
goods.
Orders for durable goods. New orders for durable goods
declined 4-1/2 per cent in November, bringing the total decrease
from the September peak to 8-1/2 per cent. The bulk of the decline
over this two-month period stemmed from a drop of over 40 per cent in
orders for defense-type products; this drop reversed an earlier sharp
run-up and brought these orders to the lowest level since December 1965.
However, the defense order backlog remained very large at the end of
November.
New orders for machinery and equipment and steel also showed
sizable declines in October and November, and for steel unfilled orders
also decreased. The order backlog for machinery and equipment continued
to expand, although at a much slower pace than earlier.
For all durable goods combined the November new order level
was the lowest since November 1965 and the backlog of unfilled orders
edged off slightly--for the first decline in almost three years.

II -13
Inventories. For manufacturing, preliminary October inventbry
figures have been revised upward appreciably. The rate of accumulation
increased substantially further in November, when the factory stock-
sales ratio reached 1.73 as compared with a level close to 1.60 pre-
vailing in 1965 and early 1966. For the two months, the average book
value increase equalled the high third quarter rate--or an annual
rate of nearly $12.billion. Trade inventory accumulation was very large
in October (an annual rate of about $6 billion), in large part because
of a sharp rise in auto stocks. Since then, however, auto stocks
have declined, and trade inventory accumulation for the entire fourth
quarter is expected to be well below the October rate.
The high rate of inventory accumulation in manufacturing
has been heavily concentrated in durable goods industries and within
that sector expansion in stocks--particularly work-in-process--was
very pronounced through November in the business and defense equip-
ment sector. In this sector expansion in production has slowed in
recent months and given the recent decline in new orders and prospects
for much smaller increases in final takings, the earlier rapid inventory
accumulation is expected to slow appreciably in coming months. For
consumer durable goods, inventory accumulation appears to have been
excessive at both the factory and distributive outlets, and output
curtailments have already been instituted for autos and some major
appliances. Despite these curtailments, inventories were high at
the end of the year, and producers and dealers are expected to work
them down during coming months.

II -14
Construction activity. Seasonally adjusted new construction
expenditures dropped 2 per cent further in November, following some
downward revision for October. At $69.9 billion, the annual rate
was 12 per cent below the peak reached last March and the lowest since
early 1965. Residential construction--down for the seventh consecutive
month--accounted for all of the further decline in November. Although
outlays for both private nonresidential and public construction were
estimated to have changed little, these had already dipped further
in October and indications were that, on a quarterly basis, the down-
trend for these sectors was continuing.

1/ Seasonally adjusted annual rates; preliminary.
Seasonally adjusted housing starts, which had plummeted
more than a fifth further in October to a twenty-year low of 841,000
(annual rate), rose nearly as sharply in November. The November
rise was closely in line with earlier expectations and reflected mainly

II -15
a much less than seasonal decline in the unadjusted series from the
unusually low level already reached in October. Even if, as seems
probable, seasonally adjusted starts in December cbntinued upward,
the average indicated for the fourth quarter as a whole would still
be below the reduced third quarter average. Moreover, while some
easing now appears to be devleoping in the mortgage markets, current
staff projections are for no significant revival in starts from the
1 million unit level until next summer. And because normal seasonal
adjustment implies an extremely sharp rise in the unadjusted data
during the spring, there is even a possibility of a seasonally
adjusted decline during the second quarter of 1967.
Building permits changed little in November from the
sharply reduced October rate, as an upturn for 1-family structures
was accompanied by a further, though moderate, drop for multi-family
structures. Apart from the Northeast, all regions continued to show
a further downdrift.

Wages. An acceleration of hourly earnings increases was
evident during 1966 in most nonfarm industries for which data are
available.

Large wage settlements, especially during the latter part
of 1966, were a factor in the higher average rate of increase. First
year wage increases in major settlements in 1966 were substantially
larger than in 1965--about 5 per cent as compared with 3.9 per cent.
The effect on average wages would have been even greater, except that
the number of workers who received wage increases in major contract
settlements in 1966 was the smallest in many years. A large number
(4.1 million) also received deferred wage adjustments under major
contracts negotiated in 1965 or earlier but these increases were
generally smaller than those obtained under contracts negotiated during
1966.
The accelerated increase in average earnings in 1966 also
reflected several other factors: the substantially larger wage rate
adjustments which occurred in the nonunionized sectors where employers

II -17
have been responding to the tightening of the labor market; the receipt
of larger wage increases in 1966 by more than 2 million workers covered
by cost-of-living escalator clauses; and the continued relative shift
of employment into higher paying industries. As a result of the per-
sistent rise in wages, and the trend toward smaller gains in productivity,
unit labor costs in manufacturing was upward during 1966; in November
they were 2-1/2 per cent above a year earlier.
Some of the factors which have tended to moderate wage
increases this past year will operate in the other direction in 1967.
A much larger number of workers--more than 3-1/2 million--are covered
by major contracts which expire this coming year, and the negotiations
will be conducted by stronger unions, namely, trucking, autos, farm
equipment, rubber, meat packing and the nonoperating railroad brother-
hoods. Also, an increase in the minimum wage early in 1967 will put
additional pressure on wages in some nonunionized sectors.
There also will be a large number of deferred wage increases
in 1967 but the average size of these wage adjustments will be
smaller than in 1966. If, in addition the economic situation and
the demand for labor weakens and if consumer price increases moderate
in 1967, upward pressure on wages should be reduced somewhat.
Price developments, The comprehensive wholesale price
indexes for November confirmed the general pattern of developments
outlined in the last Green Book. Industrial commodities edged up
slightly while foodstuffs fell about 1.5 per cent. The total
index, consequently, declined somewhat further; it was down nearly

II -18
1 per cent from the August-September peak, and the increase over a
year ago narrowed to about 2.5 per cent.
For industrial commodities, the November increase was very
small; as in October--and also through the summer months--declines
in sensitive materials roughly offset increases in finished products,
chiefly machinery and furniture. The increase of 0.5 per cent in the
index for machinery and equipment was about in line with average monthly
increases earlier in 1966. Since November, prices of metals and
products generally have remained strong, announced increases among
chemicals appear to outweigh announced decreases, and the declines
among sensitive commodities have tapered off if they have not ended.
Price weaknesses among textiles, however, may have continued in
December. Altogether it appears likely that the industrial commodity
average continued to rise in December.
Wholesale prices of foodstuffs apparently have eased slightly
further since mid-November. Livestock and meat prices declined some-
what in contrast with the large increases in December a year ago; in
December, livestock prices were down about 15 per cent and meat prices
7 per cent from a year earlier.
The long string of sizable increases in the consumer price
index was broken in November when the total rose by only 0.1 per cent.
The long-awaited decline in food prices developed, with decreases
of 0.9 per cent in food-store prices and 0.7 per cent in the total
for food including restaurant meals which, as shown in the table,

II -19
continued to rise. Commodities less food rose further, with increases
in apparel, housefurnishings, and new cars--the last strictly seasonal.
On a seasonally adjusted basis, the rise in nonfood commodities remained
close to the 2 per cent annual rate of the past year. Services, led
by medical care, continued to exert a strong upward push on the total.
One may optimistically speculate that in December the index
will again show only a small increase; it could even be stable--which
last happened in January--or decline--which it last did in August of
1965. November's decrease in food prices owed something to-reductions
in meats, but later evidence on market supplies and wholesale meat
prices suggests further declines in retail prices from the November
levels. These may not be fully offset by seasonal increases in other
foods. End-of-season sales of apparel generally begin in December,
and discounting on new cars may have begun earlier this year in view
of the contraction in demand and the high level of dealers' stocks.
Used car prices declined somewhat in November, and market conditions
may have caused a further decline since then. Services, of course,
continued upward but there is no basis for a guess at the rate,

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL SITUATION
Bank credit. Preliminary estimates indicate that commercial
bank credit on an end-of-month basis rose substantially in December,
perhaps at an annual rate of around 11 per cent. However on a daily
average basis bank credit showed less of an increase in December. The
bank credit proxy, the daily average of total member bank deposits,
increased only at an estimated 3,4 per cent rate during the month.
The more rapid rise in total bank assets as measured on an-end-of-
month basis primarily reflected the continual growth of bank credit
during December from a relatively low end-of-November level. December's
rise in credit was far above November's nominal end-of-month increase,
and contrasted sharply with the 5.2 per cent annual rate of decline
from the end of August to the end of October. Expansion in bank
earning assets during December was made possible primarily by the
sharp rise in bank time deposits, which followed small average
monthly increases since mid-summer.
The increase in total bank credit was accounted for largely
by increases in bank holdings of U.S. Government securities and loans
other than business credits--especially loans to security brokers and
dealers. Business loans showed little further change while bank
holdings of municipal and other securities increased only moderately.

The substantial increase in bank holdings of Treasury issues
mainly reflected acquisitions of bills and other short-term issues.
These acquisitions partly represented bank efforts to rebuild their
liquidity positions after the sharp reductions in recent months and
partly window dressing operations for year-end statements. In the
four weeks ending December 28 weekly reporting banks, especially those
outside of New York, added $1,364 million to their holdings of
Treasury issues--an unusually large increase for these four weeks.
The lack of expansion in business loans in December
apparently continued to reflect both the cumulative effects of
restrictive bank lending policies in recent months and some further
lessening in the demand for bank loans. In any event the failure of

III -3
business loans to expand was especially surprising in that total
corporate tax payments are estimated to have been $1.6 billion
larger than in December 1965. Based on reports from 71 of the 81 banks
in the quarterly interest rate survey, the December 15 survey shows
that a significantly greater percentage of banks (about 25 per cent)
reported moderately weaker loan demand compared with only 6 per cent
three months earlier, although most banks reported over-all demand
unchanged, Moreover, about 16 per cent of the banks also anticipated
that loan demands would be moderately weaker over the next three
months./
Most industries increased their bank loans less than sea-
sonally in December. However, producers of machinery and transport
equipment continued to increase their loans rapidly. Loans to
commodity dealers, reflecting in part large CCC sales of quality
cotton, rose contraseasonally.
Because of the unusually large increase in dealer inventories
of Treasury and Agency issues during the month, dealer financing needs
rose substantially. With no business loan expansion, and with bank
deposits rising during the month, banks were able to satisfy much of
these dealer needs. Through the four weeks ending December 28, bank
loans to security dealers and brokers increased by $1,390 million,
with more than half of this increase occurring in the week ending
December 28, On the other hand, loans to nonbank financial institutions
are estimated to have increased by the usual amount in December, even
though bank borrowing by finance companies was especially large during
the tax period.
1/ A more detailed summary of the results of the survey will be available
in the supplement to be distributed Friday January 6.

Bank deposits. On a daily average basis time and savings
deposits at commercial banks rose by an estimated $1.1 billion during
December, or at an annual rate of 8.4 per cent. While somewhat below
the 11 per cent annual rate of increase for the first 8 months of this
year, December's estimated growth compares with a less than one per
cent rate of gain over the previous three months. As shown in the
table reserve city banks outside of New York City and Chicago made
substantial gains during the month. Time deposits at New York City
and Chicago banks, on a seasonally adjusted daily average basis, declined
by 5.4 per cent, substantially less than the losses of other recent
months. This reflects some weakness at these banks in late November
and early December, followed by large gains over the last three weeks
of the month. Country banks increasedtheir outstandings at about a
12 to 13 per cent annual rate, somewhat more than in most recent months.

The increased attractiveness of CD rates relative to rates
on other short-term market instruments, particularly Treasury bills,
was primarily responsible for this dramatic turnaround. Although
facing a record $5,6 billion of December CD maturities and an expec-
tation of large seasonal attrition because of maturities at the tax
and dividend dates, banks actually were able to make record sales of
new CD's and their outstandings rose by about $170 million over the
month. Sales were particularly large for banks outside of New York,
but even New York City banks replaced all but $50 million of their
$2.3 billion December maturities, their smallest runoff in five months.
During the tax weeks the net run-off was only $65 million, compared
with $528 million and $338 million for the comparable weeks in 1965
and 1964. Preliminary results of the December 28 survey of the maturity
distribution of outstanding negotiable CD's show that banks will have
$5.5 billion of CD's maturing in January, about the same as matured in
December. These data indicate that banks continued to sell pre-
dominately short CD's.
Weekly reporting banks also increased their time deposits
other than CD's by $660 million in the four weeks ending December 28.
This was the strongest showing for these deposits in three months.
Banks affected by the late September rollback in ceiling
rates continue to have time deposit inflows similar to those reported
in Appendix A of the last Green Book. That is, from the end of
September through the end of November, interest-bearing deposits at
small banks in the surveillance program have remained unchanged, while
these deposits at small banks not affected by the rollback showed

III -6
modest growth. In the case of large banks with high negotiable CD-
to-deposit ratios, interest-bearing deposits declined as compared
with no growth in time deposits for other large banks.
The money stock is now estimated to have risen by about
$1.1 billion in December, an annual rate of less than 8 per cent,
following a decline of 2.7 per cent from June through November. Over
the last half of the year the money stock declined by about $800
million, or at an annual rate of less than one per cent. For the year
1966 as a whole it increased 2.0 per cent.
Most of the December increase in money stock was in private
demand deposits, reflecting in part the $700 million decline in U.S.
Government deposits. With restrictions on new Treasury borrowing imposed
by the legal debt ceiling, the Treasury drew down its balances at
commercial banks through the first three weeks of the month.
Large bank borrowing from their foreign branches declined
by about $240 million in the three weeks ending December 28, a decline
which was less than had been associated with year-end window dressing
in recent years. This may indicate continued strong demand by large
banks for Euro-dollars, even though time deposit flows improved in
December.

III
Corporate and municipal bond markets. Yields on new and
recently offered corporate bonds have declined about 25 basis points
from the recent highs reached at mid-November, and nearly 40 basis
points from the 1966 peaks of late last summer. Over the same periods
municipal bond yields have dropped as much as 25 and 50 basis points,
respectively. At current levels, yields on new corporate bonds have
reversed nearly 1/3 of their advance between the discount rate change
in December 1965 and their 1966 highs; while municipal bond yields have
reversed as much as five-eights of their earlier advance.
Yield declines since mid-November have occurred despite the
heavy calendar of new corporate and municipal bonds already marketed in
December and the continuing large volume scheduled for January. While
the strength of investor demand for bonds has reflected market expecta-
tions of declining long-term rates, the quick distribution of December
offerings was also aided by the investment of large turn-of-the-year
supplies of funds available to pension funds, fire and casualty companies,
and trust accounts.

Corporate bond issues scheduled for public offering in
January now total $690 million. Allowing for late announcements, the
calendar may ultimately total as much as $775 million, which compares
with only $460 million in January a year ago. More than half of this
total represents the AT&T and Bethlehem Steel issues scheduled for
offering next week. It should be noted, however, that if the pattern
of over-all corporate financing evident in recent months persists during
January, the enlarged calendar of public offerings may not represent any
significant year-to-year rise in total corporate demands on capital
markets; smaller take-dowrnof private placements may about offset the
relative growth in public offerings.
Other types of debt issues competitive with corporate bonds
will also add significantly to the total volume of January security
financing. Among these, this week's $600 million offering of FNMA
participation certificates is the most important. But, in addition,
$100 million of foreign bond issues have been scheduled for January
offering. Thus, the January calendar of taxable security offerings
looms as a formidable one which may create resistance to further yield
declines -- particularly so since other Federal participation certif-
icate offerings are expected as the year progresses and the volume of
new corporate issues already planned for February and March is quite
large for such an early point in the year.

Tax exempt bond issues already scheduled for January are
also lage ($875 million), and ultimately the total for the month will
probably exceed $1.1 billion. While this would be less than the record
January volume a year ago, it would be the largest monthly total since
June. Moreover, in the period ahead the forward calendar may be further
augmented by several sizable negotiated issues, as well as by reofferings
of issues deferred earlier due to market congestion and high rates.
Current yield levels on municipal bonds may not be maintained
in January unless commercial banks acquire an increased share of the
large net addition to supply. Take downs of bank purchase of municipals
normally are reflected in portfolios only after about a month lag behind
actual commitments, but reports from dealers suggest that banks haveStocks

Mortae market developments. The tone of the mortgage
market appears to have improved in recent months, with indications of
actual or prospective credit easing and renewed flow of savings to
savings and loan associations and other major lender groups. Neverthe-
less, given the unusual scarcity of funds during most of 1966 and the
uncertainties still prevailing, trade and other expectations at the
year-end were that it would be some time before improvement in funds-
flows would be reflected in a significant upturn in commitments and a
decline in mortgage rates.
In November, the latest month for which data are available,
yields on mortgages were at a record high. For 6 per cent, 30-year,
FHA-insured mortgages, secondary market yields averaged 6.81 per cent.

III -11
This compared with 6.63 per cent for 5-3/4 per cent mortgages in
September, the last full month when the 5-3/4 per cent regulatory
maximum, effective in early October, was associated with some improve-
ment in average prices (and therefore in discounts) offered by investors
in such mortgages. But the level of yields were 130 basis points above
a year earlier when the regulatory maximum was 5-1/4 per cent.
Contract rates on conventional first mortgages on homes --
FHA series -- held at the advanced October levels in November -- 6.70
per cent for loans on new homes and 6.75 per cent for loans on existing
homes. (These data are reported by FHA rounded to the nearest five
basis points.) This was only the second time since October 1965, when
tightening was already becoming evident, that the series did not show a
rise. Even so, although the year-to-year increase in November was much
less than for FHA-insured yields, it was still substantial, amounting to
80 basis points for mortgages on both new and existing homes.
Loan/price and maturity terms in November were holding at
or very near the restrictive levels reached early last autumn for loans
on both new and existing homes, according to the Federal Home Loan Bank
Board. Moreover, although prices of homes involved in transactions were
still appreciably higher than a year earlier, average loan amounts were
staying fairly close to year-earlier levels but somewhat below prior
peaks.

Nonfarm real estate foreclosures dipped about seasonally from
the second to the third quarter of 1966. The year-to-year increase,
1 per cent, was the smallest since late 1959 and the foreclosure rate
was the lowest for any third quarter since 1963. Foreclosures reflect,
in large part, the result of decisions made some time earlier as well
as more recent income and mortgage-market developments. However, given
the pattern of more cautious lending that has prevailed in recent years,
and particularly in 1966, some further improvement in foreclosure rates
seems likely.

Flows to depositary-type intermediaries. Net inflows of
share capital to savings and loan associations showed a substantial
pick-up in November, and savings flows to mutual savings banks continued
the relative improvement already evident in preceding months. While
some of this improvement was largely offset by the poor November time
deposit performance at commercial banks (even after exclusion of large
CD's), all three types of institutions apparently experienced relative
gains in their savings inflows during December.

The November increase of share capital at S&L's exceeded
$600 million, better than for any other month this year in which there
was no crediting of dividends. While no data are yet available on
December changes in share capital, S&L deposits with the Home Loan Banks
rose in December and their advances declined, both contraseasonally.
This strongly suggests that the November pick-up of S&L savings flows
has persisted.
November inflows at mutual savings banks fell only 8 per cent
short of November 1965. And contrary to October, when improved flows
were heavily concentrated among New York State banks, November gains
were more widely shared by banks outside New York as well. Data avail-
able for the first half of December from the 15 largest savings banks in
New York City show that these institutions experienced a net inflow of
$45 million, the largest on record for these weeks. And in the first

III -15
four days of the end of quarter reinvestment period -- in which with-
drawals can be made without sacrificing accrued interest -- the volume
of net withdrawals was a little less than half as large as in the com-
parable period a year ago.
Assuming that the fragmentary evidence now available for
December correctly indicates the likely course of flows for both S&L's
and savings banks, the net gain of share capital for S&L's may total
about $2 billion in the fourth quarter, about 30 per cent less than in
the like period of 1965. This is the smallest year-to-year short-fall
since the January-March quarter of 1966, when the relative decline was
also nearly 30 per cent. At savings banks the net inflow in the fourth
quarter should total about $900 million, less than 15 per cent below a
year ago.
Stock market. Standard and Poor's composite stock price
index, after rising during the first half of December, declined on
balance during the second half and showed little net change for the
month. Price weakness in the closing weeks of the year reflected heavy
tax-loss selling in combination with some hesitation on the part of
sellers to reinvest the proceeds in stocks. At the start of the new
year the index was 80.38, still about 10 per cent above the 1966 low
registered in early October, but 2-1/2 per cent below the recent high
reached at mid-November and 14-1/2 per cent below the record high of
last February.
Trading volume during December was quite brisk, as is
typically the case in a period of active tax adjustments and ended the

II -16
month with an 11 million-share day, third largest for the year. For
the month as a whole, activity averaged 7.9 million shares per day, the
highest for any month since May, but substantially less than in December
a year ago when speculative interest was large.
In November, although stock prices had advanced slightly on
balance, the use of stock market credit by margin customers declined
$27 million, as measured by the NYSE margin account panel. Thus, on
November 30, margin debt had declined $270 million or about 5 per cent
from the record total reached in April 1966.

III -17
U.S. Government securities market, In recent weeks yields
have declined sharply in all maturity sectors of the U.S. Government
securities market and in early January were some 50 to 125 basis points
below their late sumner peaks. Yields on intermediate and long-term
bonds have fallen to their lowest levels in nearly a year.

The recent declines in
continued signs of moderation inTreasury bond yields occurred as
the domestic economy and of a less
restrictive posture for monetary policy overcame the adverse implica-
tions of large current and prospective offerings of new corporate
and municipal issues and of FNMA participation certificates. The
decline in yields was fueled by dealer efforts to build up their

IIl -18
inventories and by a pick-up in investment demand by institutional
investors. In this market atmosphere, prices of many intermediate-
and long-term issues rose 3 or 4 points from late November to early
January and yields on such issues declined 30 to 60 basis points.
Treasury bill rates fell during most of December but turned
up somewhat late in the month. The earlier decline was stimulated
by sizable dealer and investment demand, with dealers building up their
positions substantially through aggressive bidding in the auctions.
Late in the month investor demand tapered off, apparently reflecting
in part a switch of funds from bills to CD's and other short-term
market instruments. As the table below shows, yields on many short-
term debt obligations other than bills have held steady or have
declined less than bill rates in recent weeks, thereby providing
increasingly attractive alternatives to investments in bills.

Federal Agency securities, A $1.1 billion offering of FNMA
participation certificates was announced on December 19, including
$600 million to be sold to the public and $500 million to Treasury
investment accounts. The publicly-offered portion is comprised of a
$300 million 15-year maturity and $150 million each of 5-year and
10-year maturities. All three maturities were priced to yield 5,20
per cent and early investor interest in the PC's was reported to be
strong.
The Export-Import Bank announced in late December that it
will sell participation certificates before the end of the current
fiscal year. No amount was set, but the January 1966 Budget docu-
ment had projected $975 million of such sales in the current fiscal
year. That document had also projected $3.2 billion of PC sales
by FNMA, of which the current issue is the first offering.
Treasury finance. The $600 million of new cash being raised
by the public sale of participation certificates should enable the
Treasury to get by a mid-January trough in its balances without
additional borrowing. Thereafter, the Treasury may not need to
return to the market for new money until late February or early
March. In any event, an increase in the debt ceiling will be required
to permit any significant amount of new borrowing.
The Treasury is expected to announce the terms of its February
refunding late this month. The refunding will involve $7.4 billion of
maturing issues, of which a relatively moderate $3.9 billion are held by
the public.

U.S. balance of payments. The payments deficit in November
exceeded $500 million on the liquidity basis (not seasonally adjusted).
It was substantially higher than had been suggested by weekly indicators,
and the deficit for October and November combined totaled $1.3 billion
before seasonal adjustment. Weekly indicators showed a further deficit
of $350 million in the period December 1-28. There was probably a
large surplus in the last few days of the month, primarily because of
several large transactions which together produced receipts of $600
million;* but unless the last two days of December produced other
large net receipts, the liquidity deficit for the fourth quarter may
be estimated at around $1 billion, seasonally adjusted, and the defi-
cit for the year at close to $2 billion, on the liquidity basis.
Information to account for the apparent substantial deteri-
oration in the payments position is not at hand. Data through November
show some improvement in the balance on merchandise trade from the
third quarter level but, on the other hand, a resumption of outflows
of short-term bank credit. The moderate easing of money market
stringency in the United States since mid-November, coupled with
increased confidence in sterling since September, may have ended or
reversed the net inflows on unrecorded transactions that benefited
the payments balance in the third quarter.
* A British debt payment of $150 million, a German payment under the
military offset agreement of $250 million, and a German debt prepayment
of $200 million.

IV -2
Both exports and imports fell in November but exports had
jumped sharply in October and the trade surplus for October and
November together came to an annual rate of $3.8 billion, up from
the $3.1 billion low reached in the third quarter.
Imports for the two months October and November, though
lower than in September, were fractionally above the third quarter
average level. From the third quarter to October-November, imports
of some manufactured goods, motor vehicles in particular, continued
to rise; but these advances were offset by a decline in imports of
industrial supplies and some foodstuffs. Most of the sharp rise in
imports of autos and parts over the past year reflects a response to
the U.S.-Canadian automotive agreement of 1965. Petroleum and sugar,
which accounted for a substantial portion of the rise in imports
between the second and third quarters, declined significantly in
October-November. Steel imports,which also advanced sharply in the
third quarter, remained unchanged. During the third quarter, imports
equalled 13 per cent of domestic consumption of steel products as
contrasted with only 7 per cent in the third quarter of 1964. Imports
of other industrial supplies appear to have declined in October-
November after having levelled off in the third quarter.
Exports increased at an annual rate of 13 per cent between
the third quarter and October-November, a somewhat faster rate of increase
than was experienced between the third quarter of 1965 and the third
quarter of 1966. The expansion from the third quarter was concentrated
in non-agricultural exports; agricultural exports increased only fraction-
ally above the high rate achieved in the third quarter (see Table).

IV -3
Civilian aircraft exports approached an annual rate of
$1 billion in October-November, up from an annual rate of $850 mil-
lion in the third quarter but about unchanged from the first half.
An expansion in aircraft exports is expected; unfilled export orders
totalled $2.6 billion at the end of October in contrast with $1.7
billion at the end of 1965.
Exports of autos and parts increased by 25 per cent between
July-November 1965 and July-November 1966, most going to Canada as
a result of the automotive agreement. Autos and parts also accounted
for one-quarter of the growth in all U.S. non-agricultural exports in
this period.

October, reflecting high borrowing costs in the U.S. market, but were
offset by increases in credits outstanding to other areas. In November,
there was no net reflow from Japan, but there were outflows of short-
term credits to other areas, and particularly to Continental Europe.
In part this outflow to Europe might have represented use of U.S.
credit lines by European borrowers resulting from stringent conditions
in the Euro-dollar market. In the first 11 months of 1966, outstanding
short-term bank credits to Europe rose (net) by more than $100 million,
while long-term credits to Europe declined by $L00 million.
Total long-term banking claims on foreigners rose $50 million
in November, after having declined $270 million in the first 10 months
of the year, but the November rise does not necessarily represent
increased willingness of U.S. banks to make term loans to foreigners.
New long-term loan commitments to foreigners in October and November
were no higher than the $70 million per month average which obtained
in the first three quarters, and the sizable November net disbursements
may well have reflected some bunching of disbursements on commitments.
Liquid liabilities to private foreigners, mainly commercial
banks, rose $900 million in October and November together, and by an
additional $350 million in the first four weeks of December, reaching
a peak at mid-month. This large fourth-quarter increase served to
finance the deficit measured on the liquidity basis, so that the
outcome measured on official reserve transactions for the quarter was
probably not far from balance, even after tkaing into account an
increase in non-liquid liabilities to foreign monetary authorities of
roughly $300 million (preliminary).

IV -5
Reserve changes and payments balances of other countries. For
other Group of Ten countries not including the United Kingdom the pre-
dominant tendency in October and November was for official reserve gains
to be smaller than in the third quarter, as may be seen in the first
three columns of the table on p. IV- 6. For all Group of Ten countries
(plus Switzerland) other than the United States and the United Kingdom,
net official reserves increased about $350 million in the third quarter
and only about $50 million in October-November. The direction of
change was similar to that shown in the U.S. balance of payments on
either of our two methods of accounting. (As noted above, the liquidity
deficit became much larger in October and November than it had been in
the third quarter, even before seasonal adjustment. Inflows of foreign
private liquid funds, primarily via U.S. bank branches, were large in
both periods.) U.S. official reserve transactions (before seasonal
adjustment) shifted from a surplus of about $400 million in the third
quarter to a deficit of about $400 million in October-November.
In contrast to these tendencies in the payments positions of
most of the major industrial countries, a marked improvement occurred
in the British balance of payments. Last summer's speculative attack
on sterling ended in September, and in place of the heavy reserve losses
(adjusted for assistance received) which the United Kingdom had suffered
in the third quarter, reserve gains (adjusted for repayments) were
achieved in October-November.
Germany provides a second exception to the recent tendency toward
smaller reserve gains. Its official reserve gains were at a somewhat more

rapid rate in October-November than in the third quarter, but were held
down in both periods by the additions German commercial banks were making
to their net foreign assets. When commercial banks' external assets and
liabilities are combined with the official reserve accounts, as is done
in the last three columns of the table, the marked enlargement of Germany's
surplus on other payments accounts becomes evident.
Apart from Britain and Germany, major shifts were toward smaller
reserve gains or reduced payments surpluses. On either basis of computation,
the Italian balance of payments moved rapidly from surplus in the third
quarter, accentuated by seasonal factors, to deficit in October-November.

A marked reversal occurred also in French official reserves, which with the
help of net inflows of banking funds in the third quarter had continued to
grow then, but were drawn down in October and November. No marked trend
is evident in the recent Canadian figures. In Japan, the seasonally large
third-quarter surplus was followed by near-balance in October on current
transactions and long-term capital. However, outflows of banking funds
have been occurring from both Canada and Japan, no doubt in response to
tightness in the U.S. and Euro-dollar markets, and these outflows caused
both Canadian and Japanese net official reserves to decline in the third
quarter.

IV -8
The table on page IV-7 puts recent reserve changes and pay-
ments balances in a broader perspective, comparing the whole five-
month period July-November 1966 with the corresponding period a year
earlier. For the nine G-10 countries other than Britain and the United
States, the combined payments surplus in this recent period was somewhat
smaller than that of July-November 1965. Within the total, however, the
German surplus was nearly $800 million larger (measured by combined
official and bank asset changes). On the other hand, the French balance
(similarly measured) had gone from surplus to deficit, with a shift of
about $400 million; and the Italian surplus had shrunk by nearly $700
million. (On an annual rate basis, these shifts would all be larger.
Eleven-month data for 1965 and 1966 do show larger shifts, but just
because these data cover longer periods, they understate the pace at
which balances have been changing recently.) The Canadian and Japanese
payments surpluses (still using the same basis of measurement) were re-
duced somewhat betweenJuly-November 1965 and July-November 1966; and,
because of the recent large increase in Canadian commercial bank net
assets and decline in Japanese bank liabilities, the official reserves
of these countries declined over the recent five-month period.
This table also shows total reserve changes for developed
countries outside the Group of Ten, and for LDC's. Comments on these
figures are given below, following a brief country-by-country review
for the G-10 countries.
Britain's payments deficit on current and long-term capital
accounts in the third quarter of 1966 was larger than in preceding quarters
though not as large as in the third quarter of 1965. Short-term capital

IV -9
flows greatly enlarged the U.K.'s (adjusted) reserve losses. An improve-
ment in the speculative atmosphere since September and a rise in exports
relative to imports have both contributed to the recent reversal of re-
serve drains.
The shrinkage of the French surplus accelerated last fall, as
demand for French exports from such major trading partners as Germany,
Britain, and the Netherlands leveled off while expanding domestic activity
stimulated French imports. In Italy similar factors have been at work
to enlarge the trade deficit. Over-all, the very large surplus of 1965
(nearly $1.6 billion) has gradually and continuously dwindled, and in
October-November 1966 the Italian accounts were apparently in deficit.
With the restoration of ample liquidity in the Italian economy in 1966,
net outflows of long-term and other non-bank capital funds reached about
$500 million in the first ten months of the year, compared with a negligible
amount the year before.
The turn-around in the German balance of payments began to
develop around the end of 1965; it has been due in considerable part to
the leveling off in German imports while exports continued to rise strongly.
Imports have been influenced by a marked easing of domestic demand pressures,
evidenced by the leveling off, and decline since June, in German industrial
production; the September-October average index was 3-1/2 per cent below
the March-June average. Net inflows to Germany of private capital other
than those involving changes in German bankst liabilities or assets con-
tinued during 1966 on a somewhat larger scale than in 1965, amounting to
about $750 million in the first nine months of 1966. On the other hand,
inflows of commercial credit (in "errors and omissions") were smaller while

IV -10
net official capital outflows were larger than in the corresponding
period the year before.
As noted earlier, the declines in Canadian and Japanese
reserves in recent months reflect sizable net outflows of commercial
banking funds. On other accounts, the Canadian current account has
shown only seasonal changes over-all since mid-1965, with the trade surplus
growing and the deficit on services also increasing. The Japanese trade
surplus, seasonally adjusted, has not changed greatly during the past
two years. Long-term capital movements have been persistently outward
since mid-1965.
Developed countries outside the Group of Ten have, on the whole,
improved their reserve positions during the course of 1966. Australia
and South Africa, which had lost over $600 million in the first three
quarters of 1965, moved into a surplus position in the next nine months
as imports fell owing mainly to policies of financial restraint (and also
quantitative restrictions in South Africa). More recently, Australian
imports have risen sharply, resulting in some loss of reserves. Quantita-
tive restrictions have been relaxed in South Africa, but exports have
advanced as well as imports. In Europe, Spain has continued to experience
reserve losses, but had seasonal gains during the summer. Among other
European countries, reserve gains in 1966 have been running at about the
same level as in 1965.
The less-developed countries, which had gained over $1.0 billion
of reserves in 1965 and an additional $400 million in the first half of
1966, lost about $250 million in July-November 1966. About $100 million
of these reserve losses was by two oil-producing countries, Libya which

IV -11
experienced rapidly rising imports, and Venezuela, from which there was
a sharp outflow of private capital in the latter part of the summer. In
Latin America, Brazil had built up its reserve position during 1965 by
$300 million; a more realistic exchange rate led to an upsurge in non-
traditional exports as well as holding down imports. There was also a
much larger amount of aid received. In 1966, as imports were allowed to
rise, reserves have apparently declined. In Asia, some countries, Thailand
in particular, have had their foreign exchange position bolstered by U.S.
military expenditures. But India, Ceylon and Pakistan have experienced
moderate losses of reserves (including IMF accounts).
Changes in commercial bank external asset positions. Confidential
data assembled by the BIS are of some help in visualizing the repercussions
in recent months of the heavy bidding for Euro-dollar funds by U.S. banks.
The table on p. IV-12 contains data on commercial banks' net
short-term external assets for nine countries. Switzerland, for whose
banks the BIS has only recently begun to obtain such monthly data is omitted.
Plus signs indicate increases in assets and/or decreases in liabilities;
minus signs indicate decreases in assets and/or increases in liabilities.
The changes in total net external assets shown in the upper half of the
table correspond, for the eight countries other than the United Kingdom,
to differences between official net reserve changes shown in the two pre-
ceding tables and the combined official and bank net asset changes also
shown in those tables.
The second section of the table give the U.S.-dollar component
of the changes in banks' net external assets. The totals ought, in
principle, to measure changes in the net U.S.-dollar assets of the banks

in the 9 countries vis-a-vis all external debtors or creditors except
other banks within the group. As the totals on line A in the last two
columns indicate, these banks increased their external U.S.-dollar assets
much more than they increased their external U.S.-dollar liabilities
during the first ten months of 1966 -- apparently by well over $2 billion
more, though the data are incomplete for July-October. (In fact, assets
increased by about $3-1/2 billion and liabilities by more than $1 billion,
but these figures include inter-bank deposits.) Presumably a good deal
of this addition to net external U.S.-dollar assets of these banks taken
as a group was acquired through swaps, market purchases covered by market
sales of dollars forward, and reversals of previous switches into sterling,
covered. A complete analysis would have to take account also of dollar
deposits obtained from residents of their own or other countries, and of
dollar loans made. In the end it would be found that the increase in net
external dollar assets of the group as a whole must have come primarily --
directly or indirectly -- from the reserves of central banks outside the
United States (or, at least, have diverted away from central banks dollars
that would otherwise have gone to them).
The third section of the table gives data for one important
segment of liabilities, U.S.-dollar deposit liabilities of the Canadian
banks to U.S. non-banks (line B),and for one important segment of assets,
claims on the United States (line C). The largest single element in line
C is the change in balances due from American banks to their branches
abroad, and a second (recently much smaller, but in some earlier months
quite large) element is the change in balances due to Canadian banks from
their agencies in the United States.

IV -14
The last line of the table is a residual, and is subject of
course to the influence of all sorts of statistical discrepancies. The
figures here may be interpreted as indicating that in the first half of
1966 the banks in the nine countries were using a considerable part of
their net purchases of dollars to make Euro-dollar loans. Since mid-year,
with U.S. banks pulling funds out of the Euro-dollar market on a greatly
increased scale, it appears that banks operating in the Euro-dollar market
may possibly have liquidated some of their Euro-dollar loans and in any
case have probably increased substantially their Euro-dollar liabilities
to external depositors outside their own circle, i.e. to commercial banks
outside the nine countries, to central banks and the BIS, and to businesses
and individuals.

APPENDIX A: CHANGES IN LABOR FORCE DEFINITIONS IN.1967*
Beginning with January 1967 data, revised definitions will
be used in the measurement of employment and unemployment through the
monthly household survey. The revisions reflect several years of
experimental work by the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Bureau of
the Census focused on implementing the basic recommendations of the
President's Committee to Appraise Employment and Unemployment Statistics
in 1962. The stated objectives are to clarify the present concepts of
unemployment and employment, to make the concepts more consistent with
public understanding and to provide additional information on manpower
resources and labor force behavior.
The principal revisions in definitions and other changes are
as follows: (1) the labor force will include persons 16 years and over
rather than 14 years and over; (2) to be counted as unemployed, in
addition to "seeking a job," a person must be (a) currently available
for work and (b) have engaged in some specific job seeking activity
within a 4-week period--no specific time period is currently used;
(3) persons with a job and looking for other jobs, such as those on
strike, will be classified as employed even though they were not at
work -- such persons are now classified as unemployed; (4) new and more
detailed questions will be asked on hours of work, duration of unemploy-
ment, and for the self-employed; (5) more information will be obtained
on persons not in the labor force.
The new definitions are not expected to change the level or
rate of unemployment substantially. However, a pretest of the new
concepts in the period November 1965-August 1966 resulted in an average
over-all unemployment rate 0.2 percentage points lower than estimated
by the current concept. It is anticipated that roughly the same
difference will hold in the future. In addition, the new age cut-off
for labor force activity at 16 rather than 14 years of age will reduce
the unemployment rate by about 0.1 percentage point.
Changes in definition of unemployment
The aim of the household survey since its inception in 1940
has been to define unemployment as the overt act of looking for work.
When the interviewer asked the question for those not already at work
"Was ..looking for work," a "yes" answer classified the persons as
unemployed. The meaning of the answer was often unclear. It could
mean that the person unsuccessfully looked for work a month or more ago.
*Prepared by A. Jane Moore, Economist, National Income, Labor and
Trade Section, Division of Research and Statistics.

A-2
the revised definitions are aimed at making the concept "unemployed"
more explicit. To be classified as unemployed under the new definition
a person must not be employed during the survey week and must have
engaged in specific work-seeking activity within the past four weeks
(unless temporarily ill) as determined by questions asked regarding the
method used to search for a job. Persons on layoff from a job or wait-
ing to start a new job within 30 days will continue to be classified as
unemployed. Persons who did not look for work within the past four weeks
because they thought no work was available in their line of work or
community -- now counted as unemployed if this reason is volunteered --
will be classified as not in the labor force.

A. Changes by age and sex
The effect of making the definition of unemployment more
explicit was to lower, on average, the level and rate of over-all
unemployment. The impact by sex and broad age groups are presented in
Table A for persons 14 years of age and over. Lower average rates of
unemployment resulted under the new definition for teenagers and adult
men; a higher average rate resulted for adult women.
(1) Adult men: The reduction in unemployment of adult men
reflected in part the change in classification to employed from unemployed
of persons with a job but not at work (because of strikes, bad weather,

A -3
vacation, etc.) who were seeking another job. The lower level also
reflected the exclusion from the unemployment count of men who had been
without a job more than 4 weeks but had not engaged in specific job
seeking activity within the past 4 weeks.
(2) Adult women: The increase in unemployment among adult
women under the new definitions probably resulted from the intermittent
nature of their job seeking. It is thought that the question on methods
used to search for work tends to recall efforts made within the 4-week
period to find a job which, under current procedures, were either for-
gotten or not volunteered.
(3) Teenagers: The reduction in unemployment of teenagers
reflected the exclusion from the unemployment count of students seeking
summer work in the spring while still attending school, because they
were not available to take a job in the survey week -- they do not meet
the requirement of current availability. This effect of the new defini-
tion will be mainly felt in April, May and June, thus changing the
seasonal pattern. Both the total and teenage unemployment rates were
reduced substantially in these months.
The 14 and 15 year old population will now be excluded from
the data on labor force, employment and unemployment. This age group
represents a very marginal group from the standpoint of labor force
activity. Nearly all 14 and 15 year olds in the labor force (about
1 million on the average) work very few hours during the school year;
while those counted as unemployed in this age group (about 100,000) seek
only part-time work. The exclusion of 14 and 15 year olds reduced the
unemployment rate by 0.1 percentage points.

B. Changes by selected characteristics
The effect of the change in definitions on the number
unemployed by duration, color, etc. are related to the points brought
out in the discussion of Table A. Thus the increase in the number of
persons seeking part-time jobs undoubtedly reflected the increase in
unemployment of adult women; while the decline in the number seeking
full-time jobs is probably due to the reduction in unemployment of
adult men. To some extent the reduction in the "never worked" category
reflected the elimination of large numbers of teenagers during the
spring months from the unemployment count.

civilian job for two consecutive weeks or more.
The more detailed questions on duration of unemployment significantly
reduced the number of persons unemployed for 15 weeks or longer and,
in part, reflected the re-classification of persons not actively seeking
work from unemployed to outside the labor force. Unemployment among
nonwhites was not affected by the change.
Employment
The addition to the new schedule of probing questions on the
number of hours worked during the survey week were designed to make it
easier for the respondent to recall any time taken off as well as of

A -5
any overtime or hours worked on a second job. In answering the old
question on hours the respondent was likely to report the scheduled
workweek and forget longer and shorter hours of work. Thus, the revised
questions indicated a sharp increase in part-time work. Similarly there
was a largely offsetting increase in the number of persons reporting
longer than scheduled hours of work. The average workweek, however, in
nonfarm industries was little affected by the new questions.
Table D also shows the effect of the probing questions asked
of the self-employed to determine if they are operators of small incor-
porated businesses. Such operators have tended to report themselves as
proprietors but since they are technically employees of a corporation,
they will now be classified as nonfarm wage and salary workers. The
previous misclassification of this group as self-employed has been a
major reason for the lower level of wage and salary employment in the
household survey compared with establishment data.

Nonworkers
The new household survey schedule also includes a number of
questions to be asked of persons who have not actively looked for work
within the preceding 4-week period -- when last worked, why left job,
nature of last job, why not looking for work, and future intentions
regarding job seeking. The BLS hopes that these questions will help
to distinguish between persons who are outside the labor force because
their past job-seeking activity led them to believe no jobs were avail-
able, from those with personal handicaps or who are not seeking work
for other reasons.

Effect of revisions on historical comparability
Insofar as possible, monthly and annual estimates for the
period 1947-1966 as well as major published and unpublished seasonally
adjusted series will be revised to take into account the higher age
cutoff.
With this exception, no revision of previously published
official estimates will be published and for most major series the new
definition data will be treated as continuous with the past. The over-
lap data showing the differences between the new and old measurement
techniques will be confined to annual averages for 1966 and will be
published in the February 1967 issue of Employment and Earnings. The
usual annual revision of seasonally adjusted monthly series to take into
account the addition of 1966 data will also be published in this issue.
Special procedures are being developed to obtain 1967 seasonal factors
for unemployed teenagers.
Accurate comparisons with the past will be difficult in a
number of series. The probing questions with respect to hours of work
will introduce a marked discontinuity in employment by hours of work
series because of the sharp increase in the number of persons reporting
less than 35 hours and 41 hours of work or more. The very large increase
in nonfarm wage and salary employment because of the reclassification
of operators of incorporated businesses from self-employed to employees
will also make comparisons with past periods difficult. The sharp
reduction in unemployment of teenagers in the April-June period -- when
students seeking summer jobs will no longer be counted as unemployed
because they are not currently available to take a job -- will change
the seasonal pattern of teenage unemployment significantly in these
months. Several years of data will be required to obtain reliable
seasonal factors for the new definition series; meanwhile comparison of
unadjusted data for previous years will be difficult.
