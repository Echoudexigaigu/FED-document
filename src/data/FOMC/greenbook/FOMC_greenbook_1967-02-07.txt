SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK
Outlook for economic activity
Expansion in over-all economic activity continues to moderate
in early 1967. Retail sales have been notably weaker, initial unemploy-
ment claims have risen more than seasonally, and industrial production
appears likely to have declined a bit in January. We now expect increases
in GNP of around $7 billion in each of the first two quarters of this
year, with the annual rate of growth in real terms reduced to about 1-1/2
per cent.
With industrial activity on the weak side, the rise in private
wages and salaries is slowing, but Government transfer payments--mainly
for Medicare--are expected to rise substantially further in the current
quarter. Moreover, a pronounced tapering off in last year's sharp rise
in personal tax payments that resulted from placing such payments on a
more current basis is expected in this and the next quarter. Thus,
disposable income apparently continues to rise at a respectable pace.
But the reduced propensity of consumers to buy goods (and increased
propensity to save), in the face of the large inventory over-hang, is
resulting in further output cutbacks. Net liquidation of stocks of
some consumer products is in prospect for the coming months.
Only a minimal further expansion in business equipment outlays
and a reduced rate of increase in defense spending are now expected;
considerably slower production gains and a sizable drop-off in the rate
of inventory accumulation in the equipment sector of manufacturing seems

1 -2
probable. On the other hand, owing in part to the effect of sharply
reduced business inventory demands on imports, net exports are expected
to rise sharply. Also, the decline in residential construction is
expected to end and State and local government outlays will likely con-
tinue to expand.
Resource use and prices
The outlook for GNP given above would result in further
decline in the rate of industrial capacity utilization and some easing
in manpower demands, particularly in manufacturing industries. In the
labor market, some lay-offs were being reported and unemployment claims
were continuing to rise more than seasonally in the first 3 weeks of
January. Excessive inventories and the general easing of demands are
narrowing the area of price advances for industrial products and prices
of some industrial materials are continuing to decline.
Declines are continuing in prices of food and farm products.
Supplies of major food items are now running substantially larger than
the relatively low volume of a year earlier. Meat production is up one-
tenth, for example, and higher domestic output is being supplemented by
a large volume of imports. The decline in retail food prices so far has
been small but further decreases may be expected. (The expected drop in
food prices accounts for much of the reduced rate of rise in the GNP
deflator shown in the GNP table,) In both November and December, the
total consumer price index rose only 0.1 per cent, and in December the
total for nonfood commodities was down slightly. Prices of services

1- 3
have continued their rapid upward course, and further boosts are
expected as the new higher minimum wage increases pervade the wage
structure.
In industry, the plant capacity utilization rate has fallen
off from last year's peak. Also, there apparently has been some further
slowing down in productivity growth, which is falling further behind the
rise in average wage rates. Upward pressures on prices from higher unit
labor costs have been partly countered in markets for industrial products--
except chemicals and metals--by reduced demands for business inventories
and decreased consumer buying of autos, home goods, and apparel.
Commercial banks
In the next two or three months, time deposit inflows of
commercial banks are likely to continue fairly large, but below the
very high January pace. While rate relationships currently make time
deposits relatively attractive financial assets, the large money market
banks apparently have become somewhat less aggressive in their efforts
to attract CD money after the record dollar inflows of CD's in January.
Their aggressiveness in the CD market is likely to be influenced in
part by the strength of business loan demand; with CD offering rates
for all maturities now below the Regulation Q ceiling, the major banks
have some flexibility to vary interest rates to attract such funds in
order to accommodate business customers.
Business loan expansion at banks in February will probably
be below the unusually rapid January pace. A part of the January loan

I-4
increase appears temporary, representing funds needed for accelerated
tax payments. Repayments of such loans and reduced inventory accumula-
tion will tend to keep business loan growth to moderate proportions in
the weeks immediately ahead. Taking a somewhat longer perspective, the
apparent sharp fourth quarter erosion of corporate liquidity is likely
to be a factor maintaining business demands for credit, including bank
loans, especially in the spring when even larger accelerated tax payments
have to be made.
It is not yet clear what impact the downward adjustments in
the prime loan rate will have on bank lending. The new issue rate on
high grade corporates is still low relative to the prevailing prime
loan rates, and, on balance, one would not expect any very significant
movement away from capital market financing toward banks. The differ-
ential in prime loan rates--with only a few banks at the lower rate--
may reflect the reportedly large backlogs of loan demands and the still
relatively unsatisfactory liquidity position of many banks.
It is likely that banks will continue efforts to improve their
positions by using deposit inflows gradually to reduce further their
reliance on very short-term borrowed funds and to acquire marketable
securities. In this process, and partly in order to anticipate loan
demands later in the spring, it would not be surprising to see banks
attempt to attract longer-term time deposits, including CD's maturing
in beyond three months.

I- 5
Outlook for the bond and mortgage markets
In capital markets, demands for funds seem likely to be
fairly well sustained in the weeks immediately ahead. With the rate
on new Aaa corporate bonds now back close to the 5 per cent level, there
is some evidence that the volume of new corporate issues is picking up
again. Demands from State and local government borrowers have also
expanded with the decline in rates, and have been running ahead of the
very high level which prevailed in the early months of 1966. Finally,
demand pressures on capital markets will continue to be reinforced by
the large immediate and prospective volume of Federal participation
certificates and also by distribution of the 5-year note component of
the current Treasury financing.
Given the demands that appear to have been generated by the
recent decline in interest rates and the continuing large external finan-
cing requirements of corporations, the short-run sustainability of current
long-term bond yields is open to some question during the period immed-
iately ahead. Recent interest rate declines have reflected in part the
bullish bond market psychology generated by the President's request for
a tax increase and lower interest rates. Without any further overt
shifts in monetary policy toward ease, or improved prospects for peace
talks on Vietnam, a technical correction from the recent rapid yield
declines is a possibility.
In mortgage markets, the marked December-January expansion
in savings flows to depositary-type intermediaries has begun to ease

I-6
mortgage availability and terms, although to some extent the pressure
for ease has reflected a shortage of immediately available mortgages
for lenders to buy in the secondary market. Much of the increase in
flows to savings and loan associations has apparently been directed
toward the rebuilding of liquidity, but a step-up in new mortgage
commitments is to be expected shortly. At the mutual savings banks,
where the pick-up in savings flows began as early as July and some
rebuilding of liquidity was accomplished during the late summer and
fall, the pace of mortgage acquisitions was resumed at a nearly normal
rate in December of last year.
At life insurance companies, the policy loan upsurge has
subsided and there is a more optimistic outlook for cash flows. Like
other institutions, insurance companies are making some effort to
rebuild liquidity, but some companies are becoming more aggressive in
making new loan commitments in both the mortgage and corporate bond
markets. The bulk of the new commitments is for delivery many months
ahead, extending into 1968.
International developments
New data relating to U.S. international transactions call for
no amendment of last month's pessimistic prognostication of a liquidity
deficit running above a $2 billion annual rate in the months ahead and
an official settlements deficit also that large. The December merchandise
trade surplus was smaller than expected, with exports down and imports
level. The net inflow of liquid funds through foreign branches of U.S.

I- 7
banks, which began to taper off at the middle of last November, has
ceased; on balance there has been some outflow since then.
For the longer-run trade outlook, no comfort can be found in
1966 price developments here and abroad. Last year, contrary to exper-
ience in other recent years, the rise both in consumer prices and in
wholesale prices of manufactures was greater in the United States than
in Common Market countries other than the Netherlands.
For the near future, however, the easing of domestic inven-
tory demand is expected to hold imports at or below their recent levels.
Exports are expected to rise further, bringing an increase in net exports.
Abroad, there are as yet no industrial production data beyond
November to show either a cessation of the British recession and an up-
turn in Germany or--what seems more likely--a continuation of weakness
through December and January. However, indications of the development
of inventory-and-fixed-investment recessions in Germany and Britain are
less disturbing now than they may have appeared two months ago. This
is so mainly because further moves have been made, in those two countries
as well as the United States, away from the extreme stringency that
characterized financial markets in the late summer and early autumn.
In Germany, the inclusion of a contingency program of public works in
the budget has had a favorable reception in the press, and clearly con-
stitutes insurance against recession. The Bundesbank has taken a series
of cautious moves to ease credit. In Britain, last week's long anticipated
reduction in Bank rate opens the way to a further decline in long-term
interest rates.

I-8
In both countries, there are indications that inventories
have been cut back considerably by now, so that a general improvement
in demand in Germany, at least, might be magnified when it comes, or
even triggered, by buying for replenishment of stocks. British policy
will no doubt seek to delay and damp any general upturn that might push
U.K. imports up, while continuing efforts to encourage productive fixed
investment.

THE ECONOMIC PICTURE IN DETAIL
The Nonfinancial Scene
Gross national product. The picture for the fourth and
first quarters remains, in broad outline, the same as presented in the
Greenbook four weeks ago. GNP rose about $14 billion in the fourth
quarter--according to the Commerce preliminary estimate--and we are
projecting a rise of only half that much in the first quarter. More-
over, we are now projecting a repetition of the slow $7 billion increase
in GNP in the second quarter. Despite a slackening anticipated in the
rate of price advances, real growth during the first half would be at
an annual rate of little more than 1.5 per cent, as compared with about
4 per cent in the last half of 1966 (and over the entire period from
late 1965 to late 1966), and it would be accompanied by some decline in
the rate of industrial capacity utilization and some rise in unemployment.
The chief contributing factor to the first half slowdown is
a projected large decline in the rate of inventory accumulation--the
stage for which was set at the end of 1966. Given the poor performance
of retail sales in the opening weeks of the year, it may be that inven-
tory reductions will not be as large as expected, or alternatively that
output rates will be cut more than now contemplated. But it is too early
to judge whether the adjustments needed in production-stocks-sales rela-
tionships will take the path of substantial reductions in output with
sales sagging, or of output maintained relatively close to earlier levels
and stocks reduced by a significant improvement in sales.

11 -2
Nonfarm inventory accumulation in the fourth quarter is now
estimated at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $15.6 billion--a new
postwar high in absolute, though not relative, terms--and this may prove
to be on the low side (the estimate for the quarter as a whole was based
on only October and preliminary November figures, and implies a marked
reduction in stockbuilding in December. A decline has now been reported
for manufacturing but complete trade data are not yet in). The fourth
quarter bulge in nonfarm inventory accumulation--which accounted for
about $5 billion of the $14 billion increase in GNP--accompanied a
marked slowing of the rise in final sales--particularly for consumption
purposes--and by November, the stock-sales ratio for manufacturing and
trade combined reached the highest level since mid-1961.
Consumption expenditures showed a very small rise in the
fourth quarter, with real takings of goods now estimated to be declining.
Despite production cutbacks instituted in some industries, stocks of
major consumer durable goods--already high--increased considerably
further. Early indications for January suggest continued slack in
retail sales, with new auto sales down further, and additional produc-
tion cutbacks have been announced. Only a small rise in consumer real
takings of goods is now projected for the current and next quarters,
and, in view of the large over-hang of stocks of consumer durables at
the end of 1966, we anticipate a sharp drop in the rate of inventory
accumulation in this sector--with net liquidation possible in some lines.
A major part of last year's large inventory build-up was
concentrated in the business and defense equipment sector--much of it

II -3
in work-in-process. In the latter part of 1966, when business fixed
investment outlays began to taper off and expansion in defense spending
was below the extraordinary third quarter increase, the rate of inven-
tory accumulation in this sector appeared to be leveling off. In the
first half of this year the prospect is for little,if any, further
expansion in business equipment outlays and--according to the new Budget
estimates--for further slowing of the rise in defense spending. Given
these developments, we are projecting a pronounced slowing of the rate
of inventory accumulation in the equipment sector. The inventory
"adjustment" envisaged for both the equipment and consumer goods
sectors is, of course, expected to have a deterrent effect on produc-
tion.
Weakness in the goods sector of the economy is expected to
virtually halt the rise in industrial employment and payrolls during
the first half of the year. However, wages and salaries in the private
service sector and in Federal and State and local Government are expected
to continue to expand at an appreciable pace, and some pick-up is
possible in the construction sector by the second quarter. Moreover,
consumers will benefit by a further rise in transfer payments in the
first quarter because of additional Medicare benefits and growth in
regular social security benefits. In addition, in the first and second
quarters, Federal income tax refunds should be large as a result of the
introduction of graduated withholding rates last May. This is expected
to slow considerably the rise in personal tax payments, which took such

II -4
a large bite out of consumers' incomes during 1966. Acting to moderate
somewhat the rise in personal--and disposable--income early this year
was a moderate boost in social security taxes.
Altogether, disposable income is projected as rising about
$9 billion in the first quarter and at a somewhat slower rate in the
second quarter. Meanwhile, with no indication yet that consumers are
breaking out of the cautious buying pattern evidenced in the late months
of 1966, personal outlays are expected to show moderately less increase
than income, and the saving rate--which rose sharply in the fourth
quarter--may rise slightly further. The estimated saving rate in the
first half, at about 6 per cent, is above the average rate prevailing
throughout this expansion period, although it was reached temporarily
at times of extra large increases in income, as in late 1965 and in mid-
1964 when taxes were cut.

II -6
Industrial production. Industrial production in January
will probably decline from the preliminary December level of 158.7 per
cent. Available output data, while insufficient to estimate the January
index with precision, show declines for both final products and materials,
and the decline in the total index may be possibly about one point.
Auto assemblies in the first four weeks of January were down
10 per cent from December and 17 per cent from a year earlier. Sales
declined further in the first 20 days of January and with stocks high,
further curtailments in output have been scheduled by all auto producers
for February. Sales of trucks eased off in the last quarter of 1966
and declined again in the first 20 days of January partly reflecting
curtailed buying because of elimination of the investment tax credit.
Inventories of trucks reached a peak in mid-July but were reduced sharply
in the August and September model changeover period. Since then they
have been rising and on January 20 were near previous highs. Truck
production, which was at record levels during much of 1966, was cur-
tailed in December and again in January.
Output of household appliances probably declined further in
January. Trade reports indicate that many companies are making selective
cuts in output to stop the rise in inventories. Curtailments also have
been announced for February, and, for the first time, have included
color television sets.
Steel ingot production declined 3 per cent further in January--
for the sixth consecutive month--reflecting the lessening in demand for

II -7
autos, trucks, and appliances. In December, output of iron and steel
mill products was down 10 per cent from the summer peak. Output of
paper board--which is sometimes viewed as a general business indicator
because of its wide use as an important packaging material--eased off
in the fourth quarter of 1966 and declined further in early January.
Unfilled orders for paper board since mid-December have posted succes-
sively larger declines from year-earlier levels and for the 4-week
period ending January 14 were 10 per cent below Last year. New orders
also declined and on January 14 were 3 per cent below a year ago.
Gains in industrial production in 1966 were substantial as
shown in the table. The rate of increase in output slowed considerably

in the fourth quarter, except for autos which rose following the severe
cutbacks during the change-over period. Final takings, however, levelled
off and the rate of inventory accumulation increased, as a larger pro-
portion of industrial production went into stocks. The slower rate of
inventory accumulation projected for the first quarter of 1967, unless

II -8
accompanied by a substantial rise in final takings, implies cutbacks in
industrial production during this period.
The rate of capacity utilization in manufacturing reached
a peak rate of 91 per cent in the first quarter of 1966. With the
additions to capacity during 1966 estimated at nearly 7 per cent for
the year, the utilization rate remained at 91 per cent in the second
and third quarters despite further increases in manufacturing output.
It then declined to 90 per cent in the fourth quarter, reflecting reduced
output of iron and steel and construction materials.

In December, the rate of capacity utilization in manufactur-
ing was estimated at 89 per cent, one point below the fourth quarter
average. If manufacturing output declines one point in January, the
utilization rate would be close to 88 per cent, the lowest rate since
the first quarter of 1965.

II -9
Autos. Daily average sales of new domestic automobiles during
the first 20 days of January were about one-fifth below the very high
sales rate a year ago. Assuming sales remain at this rate in the final
10 days, the seasonally adjusted annual rate for January would be about
7.5 million units, compared to 8.0 million for December and 9.4 million
a year ago. Trade reports indicate that reduced demands for autos are
resulting in output cuts in Canada and European countries as well as in
the United States.
Although domestic output was curtailed by about 10 per cent
in January, the reduced rate of sales would probably result in a further
increase in the number of cars held in dealer inventories to about 1.5
million units by the end of January. January is usually a month of
seasonally large increases in stocks, however, and on a seasonally
adjusted basis stocks at the end of January would be below the end of
December.
Consumer credit. Consumers added to their instalment debt in
December at a relatively slow pace. The seasonally adjusted annual
rate of increase for October was a very low $4.6 billion. November saw
a slight increase to $5.3 billion, but early reports from commercial
banks and retailers indicate that in December the rate dropped off again,
possibly to about $5.0 billion. For the fourth quarter as a whole, the
rate also was about $5.0 billion, the lowest for any quarter in over
4 years.

II -10
The slow pace of expansion in December reflected largely the
turndown in new car sales, but sales of color television, furniture,
and major appliances--all big ticket items frequently bought on credit--
were also less buoyant than earlier. Restrictive lenders; standards,
as well as reduced demands, also played a role. In recent weeks, however,
there have been scattered reports of some easing in credit standards
accompanying the general easing of monetary conditions.
A significant feature of the instalment credit expansion in
1966 was the levelling off in new credit extensions. Extensions were at a
$79 billion annual rate in the first quarter but increased little further
in subsequent quarters. Repayments on instalment debt continued to grow,
however, from an annual rate of just under $72 billion in the first
quarter to a little over $74 billion in the fourth. Thus, over much of
1966--and particularly since the fall--there has been a narrowing of the
excess of extensions over repayments.
Construction activity. New construction outlays--revised
upward by 2 per cent for November--dipped slightly in December to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of $70.4 billion. The decline, which
continued to be mainly in residential activity, brought the total to
$74.6 billion for 1966 as a whole. This was 4 per cent higher than in
1965, but it amounted to a slight year-to-year decline in real terms.
Reflecting in part the sharp further reduction in residential
construction toward the year end, both private nonresidential and public
construction exceeded residential expenditures in the fourth quarter of

II -11
1966, as shown in the table. And, although each of these sectors
remained below the highs reached in the first quarter of the year, they
maintained their advanced third quarter levels.

I/ Seasonally adjusted annual rates; preliminary.
Seasonally adjusted housing starts, which led residential
outlays, rose nearly a tenth further in December, but only to an annual
rate of 1.1 million units. Starts for the year as a whole totaled only
1.2 million, nearly a fifth below the already declining level in 1965
and the lowest since 1957.
The rise in the seasonally adjusted series in December, as
in November, reflected a less than seasonal decline in the unadjusted
data. Including the 20-year low of 848,000 reached in October, moreover,
the fourth quarter average was appreciably below the reduced third
quarter rate; the decline was particularly marked for the Northeast
states, as shown in the table. Issuances of building permits increased
from November to December, especially for single-family structures, but
for the quarter as a whole also were at a sharply reduced rate.

I/ Seasonally adjusted annual rate; preliminary.
Prospects are for an annual rate of starts of a million or
better in the first quarter, based on seasonal adjustment considerations,
the low level of starts already reached, and also the recent sharp
improvement in prospects for mortgage flows. Whether the projected first
quarter improvement in starts can be sustained on a seasonally adjusted
basis during the second quarter will depend on the extent of the unad-
justed rise that can be achieved during the spring months. Under normal
conditions, seasonal expectations are for an expansion in actual starts
of about 60 per cent from the first to the second quarters, and for a
virtual doubling in the number of starts from January to May. In view
of this, and given the abruptness of the shift in financial markets,
lender needs to replenish liquidity, the interrupted momentum of builder
plans during 1966 and the time required by lenders, builders and prospec-
tive home buyers alike to review and adjust expectations, it seems

II -13
unlikely that more than the usual seasonal rise in starts can be
accomodated this spring. Thus, an appreciable rise in the seasonally
adjusted starts series probably will be delayed until the third quarter,
even if easier credit conditions persist. But the rapidity of change in
financial conditions improves prospects for a second quarter rate of
starts at least equal to the first quarter rate.
Business inventories. Inventory accumulation by manufacturers
declined appreciably in December (the book value increase totaled $775
million as compared with $1.1 billion in November), while shipments
increased moderately following some months of little change. As a
result, the factory stock-sales ratio declined somewhat but remained
well above the low levels prevailing in 1965 and early 1966.
Reduction in the rate of accumulation in December was concen-
trated in durable goods and it occurred in both the equipment and consumer
durables sectors.
For the entire fourth quarter, the inventory book value
increase now indicated for manufacturing was at an annual rate of about
$11 billion, down moderately from $11.7 billion in the third quarter.
Trade inventory figures are not yet available for December.
In October and November,inventory accumulation at wholesale and retail
distributors combined was at an (average) annual rate of nearly $6
billion--as compared with less than $1.5 billion in the third quarter.
Book value increases in October and November were especially large for
wholesale distributors of durable goods and for retail auto dealers.

II -14
The prospect for trade inventory accumulation in December is
uncertain. While it is expected to show a drop from the high October-
November rate (the increase at wholesale was surprisingly large in those
months and these inventories fluctuate considerably from month to month;
and also, unit auto stocks stopped increasing in December),the sizable
decline now reported for retail sales in December may have resulted in
a large back-up in stocks outside auto dealers. Altogether, we are now
estimating the book value increase in stocks for manufacturing and trade
combined in the fourth quarter at an annual rate of around $16 billion,
as compared with $13 billion in the third quarter.
Orders for durable goods. New orders for durable goods
increased about 3.5 per cent in December, following a decline totaling
9 per cent between September and November. Durable shipments also
increased in December and the unfilled order backlog was about unchanged
from the October-November level. For durable goods industries with
backlogs, the total value of unfilled orders represented 3.60 months'
shipments in December, as compared with 3.67 in November and October
and 3.15 in mid-1965 before the defense-stimulated boom began.
The recovery in new orders in December--as well as the sharp
preceding two month decline--was concentrated mainly in the defense
products industries. The December order level for these industries,
while sharply below the exceptional September peak, was close to the
average for the other months in the year and well above year-earlier
levels; unfilled orders rose somewhat to a new high. New orders for

II -15
machinery and equipment edged down slightly further in December and
were nearly 10 per cent below their midyear high; the order backlog
stabilized at a level nearly a fourth above a year earlier.
Labor market. Layoffs and short workweek schedules continued
to be reported in January in the automobile and some consumer appliance
industries and unemployment claims, on a seasonally adjusted basis, were
at slightly higher levels than at the end of the year. Despite weakness
in selected activities, the over-all employment picture apparently
remained strong in January.
There was a quarter million increase in nonfarm jobs in
December following an expansion of 350,000 (revised) in November. One
element in December's employment rise was a modest pick-up (seasonally
adjusted) in construction employment, following a substantial decline
beginning last spring. The expansion in nonfarm payroll employment
between the fourth quarters of 1965 and 1966 totaled 2.9 million, an
increase of 4.7 per cent over the year. December's unemployment rate
of 3.8 per cent--virtually unchanged over the month--remained in the
narrow range of 3.7 to 4.0 per cent that characterized unemployment
throughout 1966.
Some indications of weakness in the labor market were reflected
in the December figures, however. The number of workers employed part-
time for economic reasons rose somewhat. The workweek of production
workers in manufacturing, usually a fairly sensitive leading indicator
of economic activity, declined by three"tenths over the month to 41.0 hours

II -16
in December, and was also 0.3 hours shorter than a year earlier. The
workweek reached a postwar high of 41.5 hours early last year. Also,
the factory hiring rate fell and the layoff rate rose in December,
pointing to a slowing in the growth of employment.
Labor force. Manpower needs of the economy in 1966 were met
by a substantial expansion of labor supply--mainly from marginal workers.
The increase in the total labor force--including the armed forces--
between the fourth quarters of 1965 and 1966 totaled 2.1 million; demo-
graphic and labor force participation trends would have suggested a
"normal" increase of only about 1.4 million.
In part this exceptionally large labor force growth reflected
an expansion of the armed forces by about half a million from the end
of 1965 to late 1966. But also reflecting exceptionally sharp demands
for civilian workers, total nonfarm employment averaged 2.2 million
higher in 1966 and agricultural employment and total unemployment each
declined by 300,000. Civilian manpower needs were met largely by the
addition to the civilian labor force of over a million adult women;
teenagers provided 300,000 additional workers, and the adult male labor
force increased by less than 200,000.
In contrast to 1966, total labor force is projected to
increase only 1.4 million in 1967. The age-sex composition of the
increase, moreover, will differ sharply from last year's. Teenagers
will contribute relatively little to the projected rise since their
population is leveling off. Instead, the 20 to 24 year-olds are expected
to account for approximately half the total increase over the next four

II -17
quarters as large number of persons born shortly after World War II
begin to reach their early twenties. Adult men and women (25 years of
age and over) are expected to account in about equal measure for the
remainder.
The smaller projected rise in the armed forces in 1967 is
expected to be filled largely from the 18 and 19 year-old group, and
could result in some reduction in the teenage civilian labor force.
The armed forces are expected to total about 3.4 million in mid-1967,
and 3.5 million by the fourth quarter--some 200,000 more than in the
fourth quarter of 1966.
Productivity and unit labor costs. The average rate of
productivity growth for the total private economy in 1966, at 2.8 per
cent, was equal to the previous year's gain, but substantially below
the 3.6 per cent average for the 1960-1965 period. Moreover, the
increase for 1966 as a whole was substantially larger than the rates
of increase in the latter quarters of the year. In fact, quarter-to-
quarter increases in productivity averaged less than one per cent
(annual rate) after the first quarter of 1966 and the year-to-year
increases declined progressively throughout the year. By year's end,
the rise in productivity over a year earlier was only 1.3 per cent.

Productivity in manufacturing showed only modest gains after
mid-1966 and for the year as a whole also averaged 2.8 per cent over
1965. In conjunction with the steady upward pressure on wages, unit
labor costs in manufacturing rose appreciably in the latter part of the
year. These costs now stand 2.7 per cent above a year ago. With no
reduction in pressure for wage increases immediately in sight and some
likely easing in output, a continued rise of unit labor costs in manu-
facturing is in prospect.
Increase in minimum wage. The first-step increase in the
minimum wage provided by the 1966 Amendments to the Fair Labor Standards
Act went into effect February 1. It is estimated that the direct impact

II -19
will raise wages by $1 billion (annual rate) in February, or by about
$2/3 billion in the first quarter. There will also be a substantial
secondary impact as other wages tend to adjust upward to maintain tra-
ditional wage differentials.
The Amendments not only raised the minimum wage from the
current $1.25 per hour to $1.40 on February 1 and to $1.60 on February 1,
1968 for workers now covered, but also extended coverage for the first
time to an additional 8 million workers mainly in services, trade, con-
struction and on farms. The minimum for newly-covered nonfarm workers
started at $1.00 per hour on February 1, and will increase by 15 cents
a year until $1.60 is reached on February 1, 1971. For farm workers the
$1.00 minimum goes up in two annual steps to $1.20 by February 1969.
Minimum wage protection was extended to 1.5 million service
workers in hospitals and educational institutions; to 700,000 workers
in restaurants, hotels and motels; to 500,000 laundry workers; and to
some 700,000 Federal Government wage board and other workers previously
specifically exempted. The largest concentration of newly covered
workers with hourly earnings of less than $1.00 is in hospitals, educa-
tional institutions, farms and laundries.
Coverage was also extended to additional workers mainly in
retail trade, construction, and gasoline service stations by lowering
or eliminating the previous annual volume of sales criteria. In retail
trade, coverage was extended to 1.5 million additional workers by lower-
ing the annual volume of business criteria from $1 million, set in the
1961 Amendments, to $500,000 on February 1, 1967 and $250,000 on
February 1, 1969. In construction, the volume of business criteria was
eliminated.

Wholesale prices. Wholesale prices of foods and farm
products showed little further decline in December, and with the
industrial commodity average unchanged, the total wholesale index
showed no change. Since mid-December, prices of livestock and meats
have risen somewhat, while eggs, grains, and some other food materials
have decreased. It is not certain, however, what the net effect of
these price changes have been, because the B.L.S. weekly indexes for
these products were discontinued--along with the total weekly index--
on December 27.
The industrial commodity price average and the total index
probably rose slightly in January, reflecting some important increases
in basic chemical and metal prices and continued advances in various
machinery and industrial supply items. The price increases for chemicals
were generally effective January 1 and were relatively moderate, except
for sulphur, which is reported to be in world-wide shortage because of
sharply expanded demands for fertilizer.
The special U.S. Arrangement to purchase copper from Chile
at the domestic price of 36 cents per pound came to an end in early
January and the price of copper supplied by Chile was raised to the
world level, which has been around 55 cents. At the same time, major
domestic copper producers raised their prices by 2 cents to a level of
38 cents per pound (a previous attempt in November 1965 was withdrawn
at Federal request). Prices for aluminum and products were raised
one-half to one cent'per pound and tubular steel mill products were

II -21
generally advanced. Steel scrap, textiles, and other sensitive markets,
however, have reflected some mounting concern over a possible business
letdown.
Consumer prices. The consumer price index showed a small
further rise in December--O.1 per cent, as in November--and ended the
year at a level 3.3 per cent higher than in December 1965. In December,
prices of food for home consumption declined slightly, but the decrease
was less than expected and the food total including restaurant meals
was unchanged. Retail prices of meats declined 1 per cent further and
were about 3 per cent below the level of last summer, but they still
appear high in relation to wholesale prices of meats and livestock.
Prices of nonfood commodities edged off 0.1 per cent in
December as a seasonal decrease in new cars and a more-than-seasonal
decrease in used cars were nearly offset by a contraseasonal increase
in apparel. Services continued on their rapid upward course, with the
total excluding rent up another 0.5 per cent.
The 3.3 per cent rise in the index over the 12 months from
December 1965 to December 1966 compares with 2.0 per cent during 1965
and an annual average increase of 1.5 per cent in 1962-64--a period
generally regarded as one of relative price stability. As the table
shows, services made a very large contribution to last year's increase
in the total index, with medical care services rising sharply. The
increase in mortgage interest rates over the year also was a significant
factor in the index, accounting for roughly 1 percentage point of the

II -22
5 per cent rise in services and about 0.3 percentage points of the rise
in the total CPI.
Retail food prices rose slightly more during 1966 than during
1965. Meats, which accounted for much of the rise in 1965, showed little
net change in 1966 but dairy and cereal products increased substantially.
Nonfood commodities rose 2 per cent in 1966, with much of the increase
resulting from higher apparel prices. For nonfood commodities, a signif-
icant portion of the difference in increases between 1965 and 1966 was
accounted for by the reduction in 1965 in Federal excise taxes on autos
and other consumer durable goods.

Food supplies. Supplies of high-protein foods are expected
to be substantially larger in the first quarter of 1967 than the rela-
tively low supplies of a year ago. Red meat and poultry slaughter will
probably be up about 10 per cent and there is little evidence of slacken-
ing in the large red meat imports which were attracted by high U.S.
prices during most of 1966.
The number of cattle on feed on January 1 was 7 per cent
larger than a year earlier and feeders have reported intentions to market
in the first quarter 8 per cent more cattle than a year ago. Slaughter
supplies will probably be smaller in the second half of the year.
The large supply of slaughter hogs on farms suggest that
pork production may average 10 to 15 per cent above the low first
quarter of 1966 with the margin narrowing later in the year. Broiler
slaughter since October has been running a tenth above year-earlier
levels and shows little sign of slackening; egg production is expanding
as the large flocks of layers come into production. Egg output for the
year will probably be 3 to 4 per cent larger than in 1966. Milk pro-
duction also is edging upward after declining in 1966.
Dry edible beans, one of the cheapest sources of protein,
are in burdensome supply because of record output. Stocks of winter
potatoes are close to the record high of last winter but the movement
out of storage is also large. The largest citrus crop of record is
being harvested. The orange crop is 28 per cent above 1965-66. Early
season movement to fresh market lagged because of slower than usual
ripening and packs of processed citrus products will be substantially
larger than last year.

II -24
Farm earnings. Net realized income of farmers in 1966 Was
$16.3 billion, $2.1 billion above that of 1965 but below the record
$17.1 billion reached in 1947. Net realized income per farm, however,
did reach a new record of $5,000, about 19 per cent above 1965, and
72 per cent above 1947. Each year since the mid-1930's total net income
has been divided among fewer, but larger, farms.
Gross realized income in 1966 came within 1 per cent of the
$50 billion mark, a new dimension in agriculture. Cash receipts totaled
$43 billion, 9.4 per cent above the preceding year; and Government pay-
ments reached $3.3 billion, about a third higher than the record of the
previous year.
The major factor in the rise in cash receipts was the expand-
ing commercial, foreign aid, and military demands for a slightly smaller
supply than a year earlier. The quantity of products marketed was 1 per
cent larger than in 1965--with stocks run off further--while prices
averaged 8 per cent higher. Receipts from the sale of livestock and
products were up 13 per cent, reflecting a 2 per cent increase in volume
of marketings and a 12 per cent increase in prices. Receipts from crops
were up 5 per cent with volume little changed and prices up 2 per cent.
The broadening of acreage diversion programs to include cotton and a sub-
stantial rise in price support payments on wheat accounted for most of
the rise in Government payments.
Production expenses rose 8 per cent to $33 billion, reflect-
ing for the most part, higher prices for purchased livestock, feed,
motor vehicles, and farm machinery. Taxes and interest expenses also

increased. Outlays for labor were little changed because, although
wage rates averaged 8 per cent higher, the number of hired workers was
smaller.
On balance, farmers sold a little more than they produced in
1966. At year-end, farm stocks of some major crops were smaller than a
year earlier but stocks of soybeans and flaxseed were larger. Final
data on livestock inventories will not be available until mid-February
but other sources suggest that cattle numbers are down while hog and
poultry numbers are larger.
Farmers' asset position--valued at current market prices--
improved during the year with the value of farm real estate rising 8 per
cent and of other assets rising 6 per cent. Debts rose too but from a
smaller base. As a result, the value of farmers' equities increased
7 per cent, or $14 billion. However, the ratio of debts to assets
increased to 16.8 per cent from 16.3 per cent in 1965 and 12.2 in 1960.
Farm income in 1967, boosted in 1966 by strong demands to the
highest level in two decades, is expected to be down a little, largely
because of the continuing rise in production costs. Gross receipts from
sales of crops are expected to rise further, reflecting larger marketings
from the expanded production indicated in a November survey of farmers'
planting plans. Little change is expected in cash receipts from sales
of livestock and products. Government payments may be down a fifth
because of smaller diversion of feed grain acreage.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL SITUATION
U.S. Government securities market. In recent weeks yields
have fallen sharply in all maturity areas of the U.S. Government securities
market. The latest declines, following advances in February, have pushed
yields on all but the shortest and the longest maturities to levels below
those prevailing at the time of the discount rate hike in early December
1965.

Major influences on the Treasury bond market in recent weeks
have included further weakness in most domestic economic indicators,
reductions in the U.K. bank rate and in other central bank rates, and

III -2
further indications of easing by the Federal Reserve following announcement
of a decrease in certain reserve requirements in late February. Against
this background, there has developed increasing speculation about a pos-
sible cut in the Federal Reserve discount rate. Restraining influences
over the recent period, affecting mainly the longest-term bonds, have
included the record calendar of new corporate issues and the $750 million
of FNMA PC's offered to the public in March.
Dealers sought aggressively to build up their holdings of
Treasury notes and bonds in recent weeks, and a moderate amount of
speculative buying was also in evidence from other market professionals
such as trading banks. Offsetting this demand, however, was a fair
amount of selling by investors switching into new corporate or Federal
Agency securities. Since early March dealer holdings of Treasury securi-
ties due in more than 1 year have risen over $100 million to $725 million
on March 27. This increase occurred in the face of System purchases
totaling about $100 million of notes and bonds maturing in more than one
year.
In the bill market, rates on the longest bill maturities have
fallen most in recent weeks, with the 1-year issue trading just below
4 per cent on some recent days. Declines in bill rates occurred as the
market was absorbing $2.7 billion of new June tax bills auctioned on
March 7, and despite money market pressures associated with the March
dividend and tax dates. The latter pressures appeared to be reflected
mainly in the Federal funds market and in closely related dealer lending
rates. Some of the pressure on dealers from the latter source was

Ill -3
relieved by sizable System repurchase agreements which totaled over $3,1
billion in the month through March 7 and averaged $315 million in amounts
outstanding per day. The System also purchased $1.0 billion of bills from
dealers in this period, up sharply from the purchases made in the same
period last year.
Despite these large purchases, dealer bill positions have re-
mained relatively high as dealers have been willing buyers of new June
tax bills and have bid aggressively for new bills in recent auctions. The
continued dealer willingness to hold bills, given still relatively high
financing costs over much of the period, has reflected their expectation
of further easing of monetary policy.
Yields on short-term debt instruments other than bills have
also declined substantially in recent weeks, as the table shows.

Corporate and municipal bond markets. Reflecting the same
background influences exerting downward pressure on Treasury bond yields,
yields on corporate and municipal bonds have turned down from the levels
to which they rose temporarily in late February. While yield declines
since late February on new corporate and seasoned municipal bonds amount
to as much as 1/8 of a percentage point, current yield levels on both
types of issues are still as much as 1/4 of a percentage point above
their earlier 1967 lows. Moreover, the most recent efforts of under-
writers to mark new issue yields still lower have encountered some
investor resistance in both markets.

In March, flotations of publicly offered securities aggregated
about $4.0 billion, including $2.9 billion of corporate and municipal
bonds, $750 million of Federal participation certificates, and $350
million of foreign and World Bank bonds. Corporate bond offerings ac-
counted for nearly $1.7 billion of the total and set a record for any
month. Investor response to these latter issues was a bit mixed, with
most industrial offerings selling out quickly, whereas several public
utility issues have recently moved rather slowly.
Reflecting the very large March calendar, total corporate
security offerings in the first quarter now appear to have aggregated
$5.8 billion, surpassing by a wide margin the previous record of $5.1
billion in the first quarter of 1966. This total includes stocks and
private placements of bonds as well as publicly offered issues. Re-
cently available January data indicate that takedowns of corporate private
placements totaled nearly $900 million in January, well above earlier
estimates and nearly 30 per cent higher than in January 1966. Reports
from the life insurance industry indicate that a part of the unexpectedly
large January total represented takedowns that were originally scheduled
for December but were postponed because of the tight fourth quarter
squeeze on insurance company cash positions. Comment from the industry
also suggests that private placements in February and March may have
been somewhat above earlier estimates.
Despite the very large volume of first quarter corporate
financing, only a moderate immediate respite from heavy public offerings
of corporate issues is likely. Bonds already scheduled for April total

III -6
nearly $900 million, and the final volume is expecte4 to amount to at
least $1 billion. At $1.0 billion, gross public bond offerings would
exceed April 1966 by about two-thirds. Looking beyond April, offerings
already scheduled for May total about $350 million and those for June
$550 million. Since financing in these months typically reaches a
seasonal peak, sizeable further additions to the two monthly calendars
as the quarter progresses would not be unexpected. But given the heavy
volume of financing already accomplished or scheduled far in 1967, some
weakening of corporate demands for funds is generally expected later in
the year.

Flows to savings and loan associations expanded nearly $300
million in the first half of January, according to a preliminary staff
estimate of the Home Loan Bank Board. When this rate of inflow is
extrapolated, it suggests that the seasonally adjusted gain in share
capital during all of January may have been as much as $550 million.
For mutual savings banks, the 15 largest institutions in New York City
experienced an unadjusted net inflow of $111 million during the first
two weeks of January, twice that in the like period of 1966 and nearly
identical with the figure for the first half of January 1965.
Despite the recent expansion of inflows at depositary-type
institutions, only the mutual savings banks resumed a nearly normal
pattern of mortgage acquisitions in December. This apparently re-
flected the earlier pick-up in their deposit growth which had already
permitted them to rebuild liquidity during the late summer and fall.

III -8
Savings and loan associations used a large part of their new inflows
in both November and December to rebuild liquidity -- in particular
to repay advances and acquire time deposits at the Home Loan Banks.
While some increase in new loan activity has been reported in January,
loan repayments and deposit increases at the Home Loan Banks have
persisted.
From November to the middle of January, S&L's reduced their
outstanding advances with the Home Loan Banks by more than $750 million
and expanded deposits by about $220 million. Pressure to reduce
outstanding advances apparently stemmed both from the Home Loan Bank
policy requiring repayment of the withdrawal advances obtained earlier,
and from the cost of these and expansion advances--which remained at
6 per cent until early January when the rate was lowered to 5-3/4 per
cent.

At life insurance companies the severe pressures on
liquidity positions which had developed in the late summer and fall

III -9
of 1966 have eased, as the policy loan scare has subsided. Also,
there is now a more confident outlook on forward cash flows from
mortgage prepayments. As a result, a number of companies--including
some of the largest--have become more active in making new loan
commitments. On the other hand, other companies, particularly those
most seriously affected by earlier policy loan increases, have taken
a more cautious approach and have in some cases used their increased
lending leeway to add to holdings of readily marketable securities.
Where new loan commitments are being made, they are said to be going
chiefly into business mortgages and corporate private placements.
While some of these allocations are still being made for 1967, the
bulk of the funds available are reportedly for commitments in 1968.

III -10
Deposits. The turnaround in time deposit inflows at commer-
cial banks, which began in early December, accelerated in January as
declines in market yields further increased the relative attractiveness
of bank deposits. On a seasonally adjusted daily average basis, time
deposits at banks expanded at an estimated annual rate of almost 17 per
cent in January--the largest rate of increase since October 1965.
Most of the increase in time deposits was centered in the
negotiable CD inflows of the largest banks, and, as a result, reserve
city banks--especially those in New York City and Chicago--showed very
high rates of time deposit growth. Country banks--most of which do not
issue negotiable CD's--increased their time deposits at about their
average 1965-66 pace. At weekly reporting banks, negotiable CD's in-
creased by about $2 billion in January, a one month record. Indeed,
in the six weeks since mid-December, weekly reporting banks are estima-
ted to have recovered over two-thirds of the $3.2 billion attrition in
their CD's over the previous four months.

After mid-January, as short-term rates declined further,
many of the larger banks reduced their CD offering rates. By the end
of the month, most banks with deposits in excess of $1 billion were
posting rates of 5-1/4 per cent across the maturity range, with a few
having reduced their CD rates to as low as 5 per cent. Most major
banks in New York City were quoting 5 per cent on CD's maturing in less
than 90 days, and offering slightly higher rates on longer-term CD's.
Even at 5 per cent, yields on 90-day CD's exceeded the investment yield
on Treasury bills by about 40 basis points at the end of January, 10
to 15 basis points above the past "normal" spreads, but considerably
below the spreads in the spring and summer of 1966 when banks last
aggressively sought CD funds.
Over the month of January, banks were able for the first time
in 6 months to extend the maturity of their new issues of CD's, con-
siderably reducing the roll-over problem faced since last summer. In
New York City, CD's sold in January carried an average maturity of 4.4
months, up from 2.5 months in December and banks outside of New York
and Chicago issued new CD's with an average maturity of 5.2 months as
compared to 3.0 months in December. Moreover, preliminary estimates
indicate that banks sold about $1 billion of CD's with 1968 maturities;
most of these were sold by banks outside of New York and Chicago.
While negotiable CD's accounted for the largest proportion
of the growth in interest-bearing deposits at banks, other forms of
time deposits also accelerated sharply. At all weekly reporting banks
during the first three weeks of January, time deposits other than large

III -12
negotiable CD's increased by $1.2 billion, almost twice as much as in
1966. A large portion of this growth reflected transfers from pass-
book savings accounts after the interest-crediting period, but still
the growth in total consumer-type interest bearing deposits (passbook
savings plus other IPC time) was larger than last January. Transfers
from passbook accounts to time deposits appear to have been greater
than last January, but were below the very large post interest-crediting
outflows from passbook accounts that occurred last April when many
banks first introduced higher rate consumer time deposits.

2/ In the fourth week of January, banks in the cities of New York and
Chicago increased their outstanding CD's by $444 million.
New York City banks also lost savings deposits, but--despite
the introduction of new 5 per cent passbook accounts (in the form of
time deposits, open account)--did not offset these outflows by increased
issues of time depsoits other than large CD's. This exception to the
pattern of other weekly reporters--evidently reflects the attraction
of mutual savings bank deposits in New York City. Mutuals in New York

III -13
City also offer 5 per cent on passbook accounts,but do not have the
notification requirement of the competitive commercial bank open account
time deposits.
Treasury deposits at commercial banks were much higher in
January, in large part due to accelerated payments of withheld income
taxes by corporations. These higher Treasury deposits more than offset
declines in private demand balances.
All in all, total bank deposits at member banks on a daily
average basis (credit proxy) expanded at a seasonally adjusted annual
rate of almost 16 per cent from December to January. However, some
repayments of foreign branch bank borrowing reduced the growth of total
member bank resources to 13 per cent.
Bank credit. Incomplete data make it possible only to pro-
vide very preliminary estimate of month-end bank credit developments
for January. With total deposit inflows greatly enlarged however, it
appears that bank credit at all commercial banks may have increased
at about a 15 per cent annual rate during January--the highest rate
since mid-1966, Bank purchases of Treasury issues moderated consider-
ably from the December pace, but other security holdings--tax warrants,
other municipals, participation certificates, and agency issues--rose
sharply. Total bank acquisitions of securities in December and
January rebuilt their holdings to about the early spring level.
Loan expansion to January appears also to have been the
largest since mid-1966, with most of the expansion centered in loans
to nonfinancial business and to security dealers. The latter loans,

III -14
made at rapidly declining interest rates over the month, reflected
mainly the continued heavy financing needs of U.S. Government security
dealers. Finance companies reduced loans at banks, as open market
financing remained relatively cheaper than bank accommodation.
The January spurt in business loans--which may have risen by
$1.5 billion, the largest increase since mid-summer--follows five months
of very moderate growth. This sharp increase in business loans is
probably temporary, however, since it appears to coincide with the im-
pact of large tax payments on liquidity-depleted nonfinancial corporations.
Tax payments by businesses in January were enlarged by an estimated $2.5
billion as the result of acceleration of payments otherwise due in
February. with business liquidity sharply reduced in the final months
of 1966, and with banks in a better position to accommodate customers,
a large portion of these tax payments appear to have been financed by
bank borrowing, mostly at the large money market banks. In addition,
in January expectations of declining market yields might have led some
corporations to seek short-term bank accommodation in anticipation of
being able to repay the proceeds from later capital market financing.
The reduction in the prime rate from 6 to 5-3/4 per cent
(with a few exceptions at 5-1/2 per cent) at the very time that
business loans were rising is explained by a number of factors. Not
only did these banks have large fund inflows at declining costs, but
the reduction in the prime rate may also be indicative of a slower
pace of basic loan demands then was indicated by banks in the mid-
December lending practices survey. Moreover, at the time of the

III -15
reduction, the prime rate was almost 100 basis poipts above the cost
of capital market financing--a record gap--and 50 to 75 basis points
above the cost of CD's. Finally, the bank which led the reduction
was in a more liquid position than most of its large competitors, and
many large non-prime banks evidently also found their position at
least as comfortable. Thus, the competitive pressures on other banks--
which might have preferred to await later developments before reducing
the prime rate--were no doubt intense.

III- 16
Mortgage market developments. With flows to institutional
lenders improving and expected to improve further, and with yields on
securities sharply reduced, easing in home mortgage markets, which
first appeared in December, has apparently developed further in re-
cent weeks. To some extent the degree of ease has reflected the fact
that improved flows of loan funds have come at a time when the supply
of mortgages available for immediate delivery to lenders has been par-
ticularly low. Because of the temporary paucity of mortgages from
private sources, investors recently bought a few mortgages from the
FNMA for the first time in many months.
In December, FHA data indicate that home mortgage yields
turned down--but only slightly--from their record highs of October or
November. On certain FHA-insured home loans, secondary-market yields
declined by 4 basis points to 6.77 per cent. On conventional first
mortgages, average contract rates were off by 5 basis points (rounded)
to 6.65 per cent on new homes and 6.70 per cent on existing homes--
both still 65 basis points above a year earlier.
On the other hand, the mixed character of the December mort-
gage market and the minor nature of yield changes are suggested by
the fact that conventional home-mortgage rates, as measured by the
FHLBB-FDIC series, actually increased slightly further. This series
purports to measure rates on loan contracts actually committed within
the month in question, whereas the FHA series is an average of field
office judgments of rates lenders are charging in local markets.
While the FHLBB-FDIC series also indicates that conventional mortgages
approved in December on new as well as existing homes carried slightly

III- 17
more restrictive average loan-to-value ratios and shorter maturities
than they did in November, a breakdown of the series by metropolitan
and nonmetropolitan areas suggests that slight tendencies toward ease
in the former (on both rates and terms) were more than offset by
further tightening in nonmetropolitan areas.
During the fourth quarter, further cut-backs in mortgage
closings and mortgage prepayments were reflected in the lowest season-
ally adjusted rate of net debt expansion in more than 5 years. Re-
ductions in net takings of mortgages on both nonfarm homes and income
properties contributed to the further decline, lowering net debt ex-
pansion by a third from the record first quarter high when FNMA net
acquisitions were unusually large. For 1966 as a whole, annual net
debt expansion of $24.5 billion was nearly a fifth below the record
increases of the two previous years.

Although savings inflows improved in the closing months of
the fourth quarter, net takings of mortgage loans by thrift institu-
tions declined. Savings and loan associations made virtually no
change in their portfolios for the first time in the postwar period,
and mutual savings bank net takings were less than in the fourth
quarters of earlier years. Commercial banks and life insurance com-
panies, which had shown larger increases in holdings than the year
before through each of the first three quarters, apparently cut
back, too. While net acquisitions by FNMA and other Federal
agencies remained relatively high, those by all other types of non-
institutional holders were smaller than in 1965.

Corporate and municipal bond markets. The sharp further
roll-back of interest rates in January has carried the average yield
on new issues of corporate bonds (adjusted to an Aaa basis) down to
the lowest level since April 1966, a full percentage point below the
peak reached late last summer. Yields on seasoned municipal bonds
have also declined sharply (three-fourths of a percentage point
since late summer); and are now at levels below those prevailing
just prior to the December 1965 discount rate increase.
Before the prime bank rate cut last week, yields on both
corporate and municipal bonds showed signs of leveling off. New
issues in both markets attracted a rather lukewarm investor response,
and yields on seasoned municipal issues turned up. Following the prime
rate action, however, lagging new issues were distributed more rapidly
and secondary market yields turned down again.

The monthly volume of municipal bond offerings swelled
to a new all-time high of more than $1.3 billion in January, in
excess of the previous monthly record set in April 1964. This volume
was about 8 per cent above January 1966 which had itself been a record
for the month. In February, although new offerings are estimated to
drop seasonally--to about $1 billion--this volume would still be
about 15 per cent in excess of February 1966.
About $125 million of the January supply of municipals
represented issues that had been definitely scheduled for 1966 but
then were postponed. Looking ahead, the combination of rapid growth
in State and local government expenditures and the recent relief from
earlier market constraints are generally expected to create a large
continuing volume of municipal security offerings this winter.

In corporate bond markets, the January volume of publicly-
offered debt aggregated about $730 million--with two large issues
accounting for $400 million of the total. While this compares with
a similar volume of only $460 million in January 1966, total corporate
bond and stock offerings may actually have been slightly smaller this
year than last because of a shrinkage in private placements.

underwriters report that there is no diminution in the volume of new
capital market financing being discussed with corporations. But they
indicate that because of the rapid recent changes in credit market
conditions, corporate managements are generally taking another look
at both the volume and timing of their prospective requirements.
Estimates just available for fourth quarter flows of funds
suggest that nonfinancial corporations in the aggregate began 1967
with a sizable accumulated financing need. Capital expenditures of
such corporations (including inventory accumulation as well as plant
and equipment outlays) exceeded their flows of internal funds in the
fourth quarter by at least as wide a margin as in the second and
third quarters. But because of the general tightness of credit,
external financing was sharply below that of earlier quarters. New
issues of bonds and stocks provided less than half as much funds as
in the third quarter, and other forms of credit market borrowing
also declined.
Corporations appear to have filled the resulting gap by
reducing their holdings of liquid assets by $7.5 billion (seasonally
adjusted annual rate) in the fourth quarter. On an unadjusted
basis, this means that corporations added much less to their liquid
assets than is usual in the fourth quarter and that the conventional
liquidity ratio (i.e., cash, deposits, and holdings of U.S. Governments
as a per cent of total current liabilities), which usually rises rather
sharply in the fourth quarter, may have changed very little.

IIl- 23
While a slower rate of inventory accumulation in the early
months of this year may result in a narrowing of the gap between
internal funds and capital expenditures, corporations are faced with
very large income tax payments this spring. In the absence of the
usual build-up in liquid assets in the closing months of last year,
and with heavy prospective needs for funds to carry out fixed capital
spending programs already in progress, the external financial needs
of corporations should be large at least over the early months of
1967.

Stock market. Common stock prices--as measured by all of the
popular indexes--have risen virtually without interruption since New
Year's Day on extremely heavy trading. For Standard and Poor's com-
posite index, the advance has amounted to nearly 8 per cent, extending
the cumulative rise from the October 1966 low to more than 17 per cent.
The rise has now made up about three-fifths of the earlier 1966 decline
in the index.
The January rise in stock prices has been widely distributed.
All but 1 of the 82 separate indexes which Standard and Poor's constructs
for major industrial groupings have advanced, with 32 of these groups
chalking up gains in excess of 10 per cent. In general, cyclically
"defensive" groups which already had experienced a significant recovery
last fall have shown the smallest additional gains. The utilities
index, for example, while up more than 20 per cent from the 1966 low,
has advanced less than 2-1/2 per cent this year. Low-priced and
speculative stocks, on the other hand, have shown larger price increases.
The two indexes of low-priced stocks have shown January increases of 12
and 17 per cent. And prices of stocks on the American Exchange--where
issues traded are typically of a more speculative character--have
advanced about 13 per cent.
Trading statistics also suggest some recent step-up in
speculative activity. On the New York Stock Exchange, activity has
averaged more than 10 million shares per day in each of the last three
weeks, and the daily average for January exceeded the all-time record
of 9.3 million shares set in April 1966 when speculative activity was
particularly large.

III -25
While speculative interest in stocks has clearly been on the
rise, its character has been different from that evident early last
year. For example, large orders from institutional investors have
apparently played a more important role in the recent market than last
spring when individuals were particularly active market participants.
Also, unlike other recent periods of intense activity, trading has
not been unusually concentrated in a small group of issues. During the
past three weeks, for example, trading in the 20 most active issues
accounted for about 15 per cent of total volume; whereas during the
large volume weeks of late 1965 and early 1966, this concentration ratio
ranged from 20 to 25 per cent. Finally, while the step-up in specula-
tive interest has been reflected in a January rise of average trading
activity on the American Stock Exchange to more than 3 million shares
per day (from 1-1/2 million shares per day in November) the recent
level of daily activity has still been only about half as large as the
Amex record established in mid-April last year.
The importance of credit financed purchases to January stock
market activity can not yet be determined, since the latest available
credit statistics are for December. The December data show an increase
of $112 million in customers' net debit balances with NYSE member
firms, but because end of month activity was much larger in December
than in November, a large part of the December increase represented an
expansion of clearing balances rather than margin credit.

U. S. Government securities market. In January yields con-
tinued to decline in all maturity sectors of the U. S. Government se-
curities market. Late in the month, yields on intermediate- and long-
term issues touched new 1966-67 lows and were close to their levels
just prior to the discount rate increase in early December 1965.

The continued decline in Treasury bond yields during January
was spurred by a variety of economic and financial developments, includ-
ing notably the President's tax hike proposal, further easing in money
market conditions, and -- late in the month -- the cut in prime loan
rates, the reduction in U. K. bank rate, and the favorable reception
accorded the Treasury's February refunding (discussed below). Some
profit-taking by dealers and other investors resulted in a temporary

III -27
pause in the market's improvement around mid-month, but yields sub-
sequently declined to new lows.
Over the course of the month, dealers were net sellers of
coupon issues, notably in the intermediate-term area where bank demand
was reported. Dealer positions in coupon issues due in more than 1-year
declined from around $800 million in late December and early January
to $680 million on January 30.
Treasury bill rates continued to move lower in January, with
the largest declines occurring in the longest maturities where rates
currently are below those in the 3-month area. Dealer bill inventories
remained sizable and late in January were at a new record level of
$4.3 billion. An improved availability of financing at lower rates in
conjunction with the market's outlook for declining yields contributed
to dealer willingness to carry these large positions. Dealer holdings
of Federal Agency securities, CD's, and bankers' acceptances have also
been substantial in recent weeks.
Downward yield adjustments on a variety of short-term debt
instruments other than bills have been substantial in January, as the
table shows. Some of these rates had previously been sluggish in
adjusting lower.

Treasury finance. On January 25 the Treasury announced a
cash refunding to replace $7.5 billion of securities maturing in mid-
February. Two new issues were offered, including a 15-month note priced
to yield 4.85 per cent and a 5-year note priced to yield 4.84 per cent.
Investor response to the refunding was enthusiastic and very lCw allot-
ment ratios were anticipated. Immediately following the closing of sub-
scription books on January 30, the new 5-year note traded at a premium
of about 1/2 point above issue price, while the new 15-month note was
quoted at a 1/4 point premium.
The next Treasury financing is expected around the latter part
of February or in early March when the Treasury has indicated it would1967

III -29
offer around $2.5 billion of June tax anticipation bills. In addition,
the Treasury is expected to raise cash over the balance of fiscal 1967
through the sale of around $2 billion of participation certificates,
all tentatively scheduled to be sold to private investors. These sales
are in addition to the $600 million of FNMA PC's sold to the public in
January and $500 million of Ex-Im PC's scheduled for offering in early
February. Finally, the Budget document estimates for Federal Agency
spending imply that these Agencies will be raising around $2.5 billion
of new money in the first half of calendar 1967.
Despite such financings, net borrowing in the market by the
Federal Government in the first half of calendar 1967 would result in
some net reduction of debt outstanding, after allowing for maturities
of tax bills in March, April, and June. As is shown in the table below,
such borrowing increased Federal Government debt slightly in the first
half of last year.
In the second half of calendar 1967, the data in the Budget
document suggest that gross cash borrowing by the Treasury through
marketable issues could exceed the $10 billion raised in the second
half of 1966, even on the assumption of a relatively low cash balance
at the end of the year. Moreover, this borrowing assumes that the
Government will bring to market some $2.5 billion of participation
certificates during July-December 1967, or about one half of the total
PC sales projected for fiscal 1968, The other Federal Agencies might
also raise something on the order of $1 billion in this period.

U.S. balance of payments. Large net receipts at the end of
December produced a surplus of $750 million for the month on the
liquidity basis, not seasonally adjusted, offsetting much of the large
October and November deficits. For the fourth quarter the deficit
seasonally adjusted was $500 million, and for the year $1.4 billion.
In early January, there were apparently large net payments, and weekly
indicators point to a deficit for the month.
The December results benefited not only from year-end
receipts -- including $600 million of official receipts from the
United Kingdom and Germany -- but also from acquisitions by foreign
monetary authorities of more than $300 million of non-liquid assets,
primarily long-term CD's.
The balance measured by official reserve transactions was
not affected by these shifts in holdings of foreign monetary authori-
ties. In December, there was nevertheless a surplus of $130 million
on this basis, and for the year a surplus of $175 million -- both
results reflecting net inflows of foreign private liquid funds. In
January there was apparently a substantial deficit on official reserve
transactions, primarily reflecting (1) very large reflows of funds
into sterling (which produced dollar accruals for the Bank of England)
and probably also (2) the repayment by the BIS of the swap drawing on
the System that had been made in late 1966. (Repayment of this drawing
reduced U.S. reserve assets, while the accompanying withdrawal of funds

IV -2
by the BIS from the Euro-dollar market would have tended to reduce U.S.
liquid liabilities to commercial banks abroad rather than to central
banks.)
The BIS withdrawal of funds from the Euro-dollar market, and
the inflows into,sterling, largely on a covered basis, have been re-
flected in a somewhat reduced level of outstanding borrowings of
Euro-dollars by U.S. banks through their foreign branches, compared to
December. Liabilities of U.S. banks to their foreign branches on
balance changed very little since early January -- about $700 million
below their December peak -- whereas, in earlier years there has been
some seasonal increase in liabilities during January. Nevertheless,
liabilities to branches, at more than $3-1/2 billion on January 25,
were $1-1/2 billion above the level of last spring, while Euro-dollar
interest rates have declined to the levels that obtained at that time.
Recent data on U.S. merchandise trade appear to reflect the
slowing of economic activity in this country, and also in some countries
abroad. Data on U.S. private capital flows do not extend beyond
December, except for information on new issues of foreign securities,
and show only fragmentary evidence of changes that might be interpreted
as a response to easier credit conditions in the United States.
In the fourth quarter, the trade surplus advanced to an
annual rate of $3-1/2 billion from the cyclically low $3.1 billion
third quarter rate. After having risen rapidly since early 1964,
imports levelled at an annual rate of $26.7 billion in the fourth
quarter, while exports -- despite a decline in Decemberl/ frcm the

December may understate both figures somewhat, since the adjustments

IV -3
high October-November average -- advanced by 2 per cent from the third
quarter to an annual rate of $30.2 billion (estimated balance of payments
basis).
A further increase in imports of machinery and motor vehicles
in the fourth quarter was offset by declines in imports of industrial
materials, food and consumer goods other than autos. The decline in
imports of industrial materials included a fall-off in imports of steel
and petroleum which had bulged high in the third quarter; but imports
of other materials (constituting 30 per cent of total imports) also
fell in the fourth quarter after having levelled off in the third
quarter. The fourth quarter decline in imports of consumer goods
other than autos was rather small, but it followed a 25 per cent
annual rate of growth in purchases of these goods between early 1965
and mid-1966.
Agricultural exports declined from the third to the fourth
quarters, while non-agricultural exports rose. However, strength in

non-agricultural exports was confined to aircraft and motor vehicles
and parts; all other non-agricultural exports together declined a
little. The sharp rise in shipments of motor vehicles and parts to
Canada is a continuation of the growth that resulted from the Canadian
auto agreement in 1965. Aircraft exports (civilian and military)
increased in the fourth quarter by about $70 million to almost $400
million, about the same rate of sales as in the first two quarters of
the year.
Exports averaged larger in October-November than in the
third quarter to Japan, Continental Western Europe, Australia and
South Africa, and to some less-developed countries outside Latin
America. (Inclusion of December data, not yet available, might alter
these comparisons.) The sharp rise in exports to Canada shown in the
chart at the end of this section represents entirely the October-
November expansion of auto shipments; all other exports to Canada
were little changed. Exports to the United Kingdom continued to
decline.
Net outflows of short-term bank credits in the fourth
quarter exceeded by almost $150 million the amount to be expected
on seasonal grounds alone. They consisted primarily of credits to
Latin America and (in October and November, when the Euro-dollar
market was particularly tight) to Europe. Outstanding credits to
Japan, which had declined throughout most of last year as Japanese
borrowers obtained financing elsewhere, rose less than seasonally in
December. For the year as a whole, there was little net change in
total outstanding short-term credits to foreigners.

IV -5
There were further net repayments ($180 million, seasonally
adjusted) of long-term bank loans in the fourth quarter, and for the
year reflows of such credits totaled $340 million. New comnitments on
long-term loans to foreigners in 1966, and particularly after mid-year,
were down from the $100 million monthly average of the last three
quarters of 1965. As shown in the table, the reduction in the total
was accounted for entirely by a decline in commitments to developed
countries. In both periods, however, new commitments were made to a
fairly wide range of developed countries, and in each period commitments
to finance U.S. exports accounted for about 40 per cent of the total
to developed countries. At least some of the decline in commitments
to developed countries may reflect use of alternative sources of
financing by borrowers in these countries.

In Germany, the cautious reduction of the Bundesbank's rediscount
rate from 5 per cent to 4-1/2 per cent on January 6 was followed on January
19 by a reduction (effective February 1) in reserve requirement ratios on
the banks' foreign liabilities -- which, for example, cut requirements
against time deposits at the largest banks from 20 per cent to 9 per cent.
This partly offset the increase in effective requirements at the beginning
of the year that resulted from removal of the privilege of deducting
foreign assets from liabilities. Meanwhile, with the balance of payments
in surplus, Bundesbank purchases of foreign exchange continue to supply
reserve funds to the banking system. Yields on German Government long-
term bonds have fallen further to around 7.33 per cent, compared with a
peak of about 8-1/2 per cent last July.

IV -7
In England, the reduction of Bank rate from 7 to 6-1/2 per cent
on January 26 ratified the decline that had already occurred in sterling
money market rates in expectation of this action. The downward movement
of U.K. long-term rates from their peak last September, briefly in-
terrupted in November, has proceeded further in the past two months;
War Loan yielded 6.71 per cent this week compared with a peak of 7.31 per
cent in early September. Despite the decline in short-term sterling
interest rates and a continuing forward discount on sterling in the ex-
change markets, covered yield differentials have favored switching from
Euro-dollars into sterling, and substantial movements occurred during
January, to the benefit of the U.K. official reserve position.
The drop in Euro-dollar rates since early December has been much
more than the one-half percentage point or so that would be expected season-
ally. The extra decline no doubt reflects the change in U.S. money market
conditions, and may have included an expectational element as well. Lia-
bilities of U.S. banks to their foreign branches have been reduced con-
siderably from their December peak, releasing Euro-dollar funds for other
uses. Probably the flow of funds into sterling assets has been fed also
by movements, partly seasonal, out of continental European money markets,
either directly or via the Euro-dollar market.
Both the Bank of Canada and the National Bank of Belgium have
reduced their Bank rates from 5-1/4 per cent to 5 per cent, effective
January 30 and February 2, respectively.
Business conditions in Germany and Britain. The last several
month's rise in seasonally adjusted unemployment in both these countries
appeared to be tapering off in December and January, but this may have been

IV -8
a result of unusually good weather rather than changes in demand trends.
For both countries the industrial production declines to November (latest
available) were especially sharp in automobiles, and also in steel and in
textiles and apparel -- probably a sign that in these cycle-sensitive
industries users' inventories were being cut back. So far no clear indica-
tions have appeared of an upturn in new orders or production in either
country. However, in Germany changes in financial markets and budgetary
developments appear to be generating some optimism about the business
future. The budget-balancing actions submitted to Parliament last week
are largely nominal, a contingency program of public works has been pro-
posed, and depreciation allowances are to be accelerated.
The evidence from France now shows a decided slowing of expan-
sion last fall, no doubt partly in reaction to the easing of demand in
Germany and Britain. Output declines are evident for autos -- following
a very good 1965-66 year -- and for textiles. There was also a dip in
total French imports in November; up to October they had been rising rapidly.
Basic commodity prices abroad. The easing of demand last year
in Britain and Germany may have been a significant factor behind the decline
in primary commodity prices on world markets. Indexes that include the
London Metals Exchange price of copper -- which fell 40 per cent from an
extraordinary peak caused by supply uncertainties -- show declines of well
over 10 per cent from last spring to late summer. Prices were of course
affected by varying supply conditions and by the workings of governmental
stabilization arrangements, but declines in prices of materials such as
metals, fibers, and natural rubber were sufficiently general to indicate
the influence of an easing in industrial demand for use or for inventory.

IV -9
Since September, movements in raw materibl and foodstuff
prices have been diverse, and indexes of such prices have fluctuated
with no clear tendency to advance or fall further.
Prices in industrial countries. In almost all European countries
and in Canada and Japan -- as well as in the United States -- consumer
price averages showed larger increases than prices of manufactures at the
wholesale level in the twelve months through November 1966. However, after
the spring of last year, the pace of consumer price advances tended to
moderate, reflecting generally slower increases in demand. The United
States and Canada were notable exceptions to this pattern of moderating
rise in consumer prices and so, to a lesser extent, was France.

Wholesale prices of manufactures also tended to advance more
slowly after the spring of 1966 than before. Some of the indexes given in
the following table (especially the French one) were affected in some degree

the early months of 1966 and their subsequent decline. In no countries
but the United States did the indexes selected for use in this table
show accelerating rises in wholesale prices of manufactures in the latter
part of 1966.

Export unit values continued to rise through the third quarter

advances in the range of 1 to 3 per cent. However, export unit values
again declined in Italy and Japan, as in the previous year. For the
United States, data are not available beyond the second quarter of 1966;
the index for that period was unchanged from a year earlier.

The Japanese consumer price rise last year, though larger than
those in many other industrialized countries, was below average for Japan;
this is partly explained by absence of the usual annual governmental action
to raise the retail price of rice.
In Italy, the continuation of relatively slow price advances
despite rapid growth in output has reflected both the absence of inflation-
ary wage increases and the availability of less-than-fully-utilized manu-
facturing capacity. Productivity gains undoubtedly much exceeded the
4 per cent increase in contractual wage rates in Italian industry in the
twelve months through October.
In the Netherlands, after rapid price increases at the beginning
of 1966, a freeze was imposed in May. Meat prices declined following the
end of an epidemic of hoof-and-mouth disease, and the easing of over-all
demand in the Netherlands has helped to keep prices under control. However,

IV -13
wholesale prices of manufactured goods have continued to rise; under the
terms of Dutch price control measures,increases in raw material prices
may be passed on in higher prices.
In Britain, increases in both retail prices and wholesale
prices of manufactures slowed in the second half of 1966, after imposition
in July of a freeze on all prices with exceptions only for increases
necessitated by unavoidable cost rises, including indirect taxes. The
price freeze ended on January 1, but the authorities have made clear that
during the current period of "severe restraint" they will continue to
use their powers to prevent price increases not justified by unavoidable
cost rises. The absence of any fast expansion in demand is tending to
minimize upward pressures on prices.
In France, productivity gains and labor force increases have
kept labor markets sufficiently free of tensions so that the rise in
wage rates has held steady, at 6 per cent, for the past year. The steady
but moderate rise in prices reflects cost-push as well as demand forces,
but neither have intensified over the past year.
Prices in Germany appear to be rising more slowly now than in
the first few months of 1966. Important elements in the consumer price
rise at that time had been sharp advances in rents and in the cost of
services and transportation, stemming largely from governmental action to
relax rent control and to increase transportation charges. In the light
of the general easing in over-all economic activity in Germany, one
official forecast has predicted that the total consumer price index will
rise by only 2 per cent in 1967, compared to an increase of about 3 per
cent in 1966.

IV -14
The Canadian consumer price index rose somewhat more rapidly
last year than in 1965, with increases concentrated in services and food;
prices of durables rose only fractionally.

APPENDIX A: THE FEDERAL BUDGET*
The President's Budget Document predicts Federal deficits
on all three bases in fiscal 1967 and 1968. All of the deficits would
be even larger if the proposed $5 billion tax increase is not enacted.
The NIA budget, stressed by the Document because of its greater use-
fulness for economic analysis, shows the smallest deficit of the
three types; the cash deficit is larger because it includes a sizeable
amount of net lending (which is a cash expenditure but not a NIA
expenditure), and the administrative deficit is even larger because
it excludes the surplus-prone trust funds.
The first table gives the three budgets for fiscal 1966,
1967, and 1968. Both receipts and expenditures are expected to grow
rapidly in all budgets, with expenditures generally growing somewhat
more rapidly to create the increasing deficits.

The major increases in expenditures are for National

The projected growth in revenues has two explanations.
First, a succession of discretionary tax rate changes are expected
to result in revenue increases of $8.0 in fiscal '67 and $5.1 billion
in fiscal '68. The important changes are the 1966 increase in Social
Security tax rates and the proposed surtax on corporate and personal
incomes. Over and above these discretionary changes, revenues are
expected to grow with the growth in projected income. Table III
breaks down the growth in revenue into these two components for each
type of tax. The table suggests that the Budget Document has projected
quite an optimistic automatic revenue increase between fiscal 1967
and 1968, but it is not clear whether this optimism pertains to the
level of income in January-June 1968 or to the relationship between
revenues and income.

Another highlight pertains to the credit programs embodied
in the budget. These credit programs involve a simple transfer of
assets between the Government and the private sector, and for this
reason are not included in the NIA budget. Yet they do affect the
liquidity of the private sector, and are important from a monetary
and economic stabilization standpoint.
The table IV gives information on net new lending by the
Government. According to the Document projections, the large amount
of net lending the Government has been doing for the past few years
will begin to tail off in fiscal 1968. New loans are expected to run
at about the same rate, but more of the loans will be sold to the
private sector in the form of participation certificates. There also
is projected to be a shift in the timing of new loans. In fiscal
years 1966 and 1967 most of the new loans came and are expected to come
in the January-June period, primarily because of the large spring
outflows from the Federal Home Loan Banks. But in fiscal 1968 the
FHLB is expected to stop its January-June net lending, and with it the
seasonal pattern of total Federal lending will change markedly.
