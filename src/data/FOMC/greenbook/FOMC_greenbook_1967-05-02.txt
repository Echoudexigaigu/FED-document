SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK
Outlook for Economic Activity
Although there was no growth in real GNP for the first quarter
as a whole, the period ended on a firmer economic tone. In closing weeks
of the quarter, private final demands strengthtened appreciably. The
downward inventory adjustment during the quarter, on the basis of still
incomplete data, was very rapid. Government outlays also were higher
than expected.
As a consequence of the recent improved performance of the
economy, second quarter GNP is now projected to show a somewhat larger
increase than estimated a month ago, and a significant increase is pro-
jected for GNP in the third quarter. The improved outlook is attributable
largely to an apparent revival in consumer goods spending. Sales of
appliances and autos in April have risen from the reduced levels reported
earlier in the year. Moreover, the rapid rise reported in nondurable
sales in March--which is somewhat suspect because of the problem of
adjusting for an unusually early Easter--appear to have been followed
by relatively strong sales in April, on the basis of weekly data.
Near-term developments, however, are clouded by ambiguities
in a number of the preliminary statistics for the first quarter, The
extremely large reduction in inventory accumulation reported from the
end of the year to February appears to be inconsistent with the relatively
small reduction indicated for industrial production, and a larger-than-
apparent inventory overhang may still exist. With stock-sales ratios
at very high levels and order backlogs declining, substantial further
reductions in inventory accumulation, and even some actual liquidation,
seems likely in the months ahead.

I -2
If the inventory adjustment still has some way to go, prevailing
bullish sentiment could be dampened by reports of further declines in
production and factory employment in the second quarter. In addition,
wage rates are continuing to rise faster than productivity, and further
increases in unit labor costs would bring additional pressure on
corporate profit margins. Reduced generation of internal funds, coupled
with a further reduction in capacity utilization rates, could operate
to weaken incentives for business fixed capital spending. We have
tentatively, therefore, projected only a small increase in fixed invest-
ment outlays through the third quarter.
On the other hand, prospects for an earlier pickup in housing
activity have improved, with housing starts rising more than seasonally
in the first quarter. With mortgage money more readily available and
rates somewhat lower, starts should rise further in the third quarter and
residential expenditures are expected to make a sizable contribution
to economic expansion. Nonresidential construction expenditures also
are expected to respond further to the availability of funds,
The impact of reduced growth in total private GNP on aggregate
economic activity is being cushioned by both reduced tax receipts and
sustained advances in total government spending. The Federal NIA
budget is estimated to have moved to a $9.6 billion deficit, annual
rate, in the first quarter 1967 as compared with a $3,6 billion deficit
in the fourth quarter 1966. Federal defense spending has exceeded
Budget estimates--and indications are that defense outlays will continue
to outrun earlier estimates. In addition, State and local purchases
continue to show strong upward momentum,

I-3
Outlook for resource use and prices
Even though the GNP outlook for the current quarter is more
optimistic than earlier, some further cutbacks in manufacturing employ-
ment, and moderate declines in industrial production and in capacity
utilization still appear in prospect. While a slight increase in total
nonfarm employment is in prospect, labor force growth should be more
rapid, bringing a rise in the unemployment rate to about 4 per cent, or
slightly over, in the next several months. The expected resurgence of
growth in the third quarter should stimulate employment somewhat, but
an increase in the workweek could offset some of the impact on hiring,
and the unemployment rate is not expected to decline until later.
Improved prospects for the economy, particularly after midyear
when much of the inventory adjustment will have been accomplished--does
not yet appear likely to be of sufficient magnitude as to precipitate
general upward demand pressures on industrial prices. Over the past
two months, prices of basic industrial materials have again weakened
considerably, following several months of relative stability. Wholesale
prices of industrial commodities showed no change in March and April,
and the over-all wholesale index declined. The weakness in basic
industrial materials prices reflects the improved world supply situation
as well as slackening in domestic and foreign demands. Industrial
prices as a whole, however, will continue under pressure from rising
unit labor costs as productivity gains are likely to remain modest,
operations to be disrupted by labor negotiations, and wage increases
to continue substantial--despite prospects for lower rates of capacity
utilization and higher unemployment.

I -4
Given the present supply outlook, agricultural prices may decline
somewhat further, but stability, or some strengthening, is in prospect
later this year if livestock producers carry through their intentions
to level off production. The sharp decline in primary agricultural
prices over the past 7 months has been translated into a lagged and much
more moderate decrease in food prices at retail. Stability--or possibly
some further decline--in retail food prices is expected to continue to
limit increases in the CPI for several months. Service prices are
expected to continue to rise at a fairly fast pace--though not so
rapidly as last year. In view of the stronger outlook for consumer
demands, retail prices of nonfood commodities are likely to resume their
upward drift after the near-stability of recent months.
Outlook for commercial banking system
Demands for bank loans by businesses are likely to be light
in May, followed by some strengthening in June, reflecting in large
part wide swings in corporate tax payments. After having accelerated
sharply in April, such payments are expected to fall $2 billion below
year-earlier levels in May and to about equal last year's advanced
level in June. Business loan demands for reasons other than tax payments
are expected to continue quite moderate. Given the current relationship
between borrowing costs at banks and in the market, and expectations
that market interest rates may not decline much further, corporate
external financing requirements are being accommodated to a large
extent in the capital markets. Further, inventory adjustments may serve
to moderate business demands for short-term bank financing in the weeks

I-5
ahead. On the other hand, if recent tendencies for increased consumer
buying of durables should continue or accelerate, bank lending to consumers
is likely to become more active,
Moderation of credit demands on banks is expected to be
accompanied by some further slackening in the rate of growth of time
and savings deposits over the next month. Recent sharp reductions in
offering rates on CD's to levels appreciably below secondary market
yields on comparable maturities suggest that banks are not eager
issuers, and may remain passive for some time unless loan demand
strengthens appreciably.
Meanwhile, some slackening from recent high growth rates in
consumer time and savings deposits appears in prospect. In the absence
of any further sizable drop in market rates, transfers of funds to
bank time and savings deposits from other financial instruments, which
have contributed to recent large inflows, are likely to taper off, With
respect to demand deposits, a decline in private demand deposits on average
in April has been more than offset by a rise in U.S. Government deposits
as a result of April tax payments. Over the coming month a sharp
reversal in these deposit movements is in prospect. But on balance the
total of demand deposits (Government and private together) may decline
as private holders utilize part of the cash they receive from the
Government to reduce bank debt.

1- 6
Capital markets outlook
The recent upturn of bond yields has reflected the effect
of more favorable business news on market expectations, coming at a
time when the forward calendar of new security offerings was building
to a volume only moderately below the March record. During the month
immediately ahead there is little prospect for any substantial respite
in new security financing. Hence any near-term decline of bond yields
would seem to depend chiefly on some combination of less optimistic
business news and further ease in money markets.
The April calendar of publicly offered corporate bonds has now
grown to more than $1.3 billion and that for municipal issues to more
than $1.0 billion. While municipal offerings may drop short of the
April total in May, corporate public offerings scheduled for May
already total in excess of $1 billion, and given the tentative announce-
ments of other sizable additions, the calendar may ultimately be as large
as in April. A sizable Treasury pre-refunding is a possibility in May,
another large issue of FNMA participation certificates will probably
be announced near the end of May, and a corporate calendar of $800
million is already scheduled for June. Moreover, the growing practice
of selling some part of large publicly-offered corporate issues for
delayed delivery has already preempted some of the forward supply of
funds available well into the summer.
In mortgage markets, record net inflows of savings to depositary-
type insitutions have maintained downward pressure on mortgage rates.

1 -7
But the unusually rapid downward momentum evident in mortgage rates from
November through March is likely to taper off in the period immediately
ahead as a result of the combined effect of heavy demands for funds in
other sectors of capital markets and a seasonal pick-up in demands for
mortgages.
Balance of payments
The payments deficit on the liquidity basis now appears to
have been roughly $600 million, seasonally adjusted, in the first quarter,
little larger than in the preceding quarter though well above the 1966
average. In each of the latest two quarters, the deficit was held down
by about $1/2 billion of special transactions--foreign official acquisi-
tions of nonliquid U.S. assets plus debt prepayments.
The merchandise trade surplus increased from an annual rate
of less than $3 billion in the fourth quarter to more than $4 billion
in the first, with exports up sharply and imports flat. Also, reflows
of U.S. bank credit, seasonally adjusted, increased. Data are not yet
available to explain what offset these favorable developments. Possibly
the hugh flows of funds into sterling this year have had some counter-
part not only in known movements of bank funds through the Eurc-dollar
market but also in increased outflows of nonbank funds from the United
States (or reduced inflows).
The first-quarter deficit on the official reserve transactions
basis was not affected by all of the special transactions that held down
the liquidity deficit, It came to a near-record $1-1/4 billion (unad-
justed) for the quarter, being swollen by a reduction of about $600 million

1- 8
in U.S. liabilities to commercial banks abroad (including branches of
U.S. banks). This deficit was financed mainly by a decline in official
U.S. holdings of convertible foreign currencies.
Interest rates in Britain, Germany, the Netherlands, and
Canada have declined at least as much as U.S. rates from last summer's
peaks, and also in recent weeks. However, credit conditions are begin-
ning to tighten in Japan, and some outflow of U.S. bank credit to Japan
and some Japanese security issues in New York are expected later this
year,
Prospects for further improvement of the current account have
been dimmed somewhat by more buoyant appraisals of the domestic outlook,
by some upward revision of prospective military spending for Vietnam, and
by further uncertainty about the strength and timing of any cyclical
upturn in Germany. Thus, while unidentified outflows occasioned by the
recovery of sterling may subside, the outlook is for a continued liquidity
deficit on roughly last year's scale, and for an even larger official
settlements deficit if U.S. banks continue--as they did in April--to
reduce their liabilities to their foreign branches.

THE ECONOMIC PICTURE IN DETAIL
The Nonfinancial Scene
Gross national product. The stronger statistics of recent
weeks have caused the staff to revise moderately upward its projection
of GNP for the second quarter. A gain of almost $8 billion, in current
dollars, is expected. With the first quarter rise officially estimated
at $5 billion, the increase in GNP over the first half would be about
$13 billion, about the same as the staff projection in the chart show
presented in early February. The expansion is expected to accelerate
in the third quarter, with a projected gain in GNP of about $14 billion
in current dollars and 4 per cent in real terms.
Although the economy experienced no real growth in the first
quarter there was a massive shift in the use of output, from excessive
inventory building in the fourth quarter to rapid expansion in final
demands in the first. Final demands rose $10.2 billion, in constant
dollars, in the first quarter, compared with only $1.2 billion in the
fourth quarter. Most of the increase was in the private sector, but
government spending was also stronger than anticipated.
Final demand seems likely to expand a little more slowly in
the second quarter, since a jump of the first quarter magnitude in con-
sumer expenditures for nondurable goods is not likely to be repeated,
and the growth in disposable income is likely to slow down. Continued
strength in final sales, including better markets for consumer durable
goods, however, will continue to be partially offset by a further

II -2
substantial drop in inventory building--from the $5.5 billion rate now
shown for the first quarter to an estimate of no change in the second
quarter. Significant improvement in inventory-sales relations, however,
is not expected to be achieved until the third quarter.-
In considering the apparent pick-up in consumer demands for
goods this spring, it is important to take into consideration the shift
that has taken place over last year in the seasonal pattern of the
Federal personal income tax take. The increase in withholdings initiated
in May last year was designed to put taxpayers on a relatively current
basis. Last year, final payments on 1965 personal tax liabilities were
very heavy, following an increase of $3 billion in social security taxes
on employees in January. As a result of rising tax payments, the large
increases in personal income did not flow through fully to disposable
incomes through the third quarter of 1966. This year, wages and salaries
are rising more slowly, but personal income is being translated into
spendable income at a faster rate; in fact, the rise in disposable income
in the first half of this year is likely to exceed that in 1966. Con-
sumers may also be encouraged by the tapering-off in the rise in consumer
1/ It should be noted that our estimates of the change in the rate of
accumulation--a drop of $5.5 billion from the first quarter rate--
does not necessarily result in our best estimate of the second
quarter level of inventory change. Further revisions of basic data,
we believe, may well show a smoother pattern of inventory change from
last autumn through spring and early summer. However, by projecting
the magnitude of change rather than levels, a more realistic rate of
growth in total GNP from first to second quarter is maintained. The
projected shift to actual liquidation of inventories in the third
quarter reflects, in part, the view that the threatened auto strike
will accelerate the pace of auto sales and deplete dealer's stocks.

II -3
prices which has occurred in the last few months. Moreover, the higher
rate of saving--averaging about 6 per cent of disposable income since
the fourth quarter of 1966--and reduced rates of auto sales and housing
are to some extent restoring consumer liquidity positions.

security benefits.
Although the largest upward revisions in estimates for the
first half are in consumer expenditures, other areas of final demand
also appear somewhat stronger than estimated earlier. Residential
construction, in particular, is reviving fairly rapidly. The February
rate of 1.2 million starts was maintained in March providing something
of a test of strength, since a large rise in actual activity is needed
to achieve even the normal seasonal improvement in March. The 1.2
million average rate of starts in the first quarter will be reflected
in rising expenditures for construction in the present and subsequent
quarters. Although the market for new houses still must be tested this

II -4
spring, mortgage money is now more plentiful, and frther adjustments
in interest rates and other terms seem likely. We have accordingly
increased our second quarter estimate of the value of work put in place
by half a billion dollars, to $23 billion, and a further rise of almost
$2 billion is projected for the third quarter.
Government spending is also providing somewhat more upward
impetus to economic expansion than had been anticipated. First quarter
defense outlays increased at a rate of $3.3 billion; this makes it
likely that the Federal Budget estimates for fiscal 1967 will be exceeded,
probably by about one billion dollars. However, in line with Budget
estimates, we have tapered the increase off this quarter and next, with
a rise of $2.5 billion and $2.1 billion (annual rates), respectively.
Federal non-defense outlays for goods and services are showing a moderate
upward trend; the sharp rise from the fourth to the first quarter is
largely the result of a drop in sales of commodities by the CCC.
State-local outlays were also revised upward in the first
quarter, partly reflecting increased construction outlays. The upward
trend in public works seems likely to continue, in view of the unprec-
edented rate of municipal bond flotations in the last few months, the
release of funds for Federal highway aid, and rising revenues. State-
local employment also continued to rise in the first quarter and sizable
increases in wage rates accounted for a sizable share of the rise in
State and local spending (and also for much of the 0.7 per cent rise in
the GNP deflator).

II -5
Capital spending for plant and equipment made no gain from
the fourth to the first quarter, and is expected to show little change
through the third quarter. A survey of larger firms carried out by
McGraw-Hill at about the time the President proposed reinstating the
investment credit failed to disclose any significant shift in expansion
plans from those reported in March by the Commerce-SEC survey.
A drop in corporate profits of at least $4.5 billion (annual
rate) in the first quarter will probably be followed by a further decline
in the second. While this decline from the almost stable rate of 1966
may have been partially anticipated at the time plans were formulated by
business early this year, in some industries the fall in profits was
probably larger than expected. Capacity utilization rates are expected
to decline to 85 per cent in the second quarter, and unit labor costs
are increasing. New orders for machinery have declined from the peak
rate of mid-1966, and the backlog of orders has also fallen somewhat.
These factors should work to limit possible resurgence in business
capital spending. However, the rate of business investment is still
extremely high by past standards, and increases in business construction
are expected to offset weakness in equipment outlays this year.

Industrial production. The virtual leveling off of the
preliminary March index of industrial production--156.4 compared with
156.1 in February--was the result of declines in output of equipment
and materials and a sharp rise in auto assemblies (13 per cent) which
more than offset a further decline in other consumer durable goods.
Industrial production in April will probably decline about one-half
point, Among final products, output of consumer durable goods other
than autos, apparel, and some business equipment lines is estimated to
have been cut back further. While over-all materials production was
unchanged in March from February, it most likely will decline further
in April. These declines should more than offset a rise in auto assem-
blies and parts amounting to one-half point in in the total index.
The relatively small changes in March in major measures of
manufacturing activity, as shown in the table, may suggest that any
further declines will be more limited and more selective than anticipated
earlier. However, first quarter reports of declining profits, continu-
ing large inventories in many lines, and uncertainties regarding consumer
takings of final goods, could still lead to deeper cuts in manufacturing
production and employment.

Selective readjustments in output in response to high
inventories and a weakening in demands began well before the January-
February decline in total industrial production and in some industries
seem to be about completed. (See table.)

Among consumer goods, auto assemblies which had been
scheduled at a reduced annual rate of about 7.5 million units in the
first quarter, were cut sharply below schedules in February by storms
and strikes and then rose in March. Aprl output will be at an annual
rate of around 7.7 million units, up 10 per cent from March but still
down 27 per cent from a year earlier. Despite the output declines for
household goods, inventories of many products are still large and unless
there is a sustained rise in consumer takings, further declines in out-
put are probable. In early April, television set production fell further.
Output of the three groupings of business equipment shown
in the table have been declining since December. This may reflect
partly an anticipation of the pending reinstatement of the investment
tax credit; two of the series include trucks, railroad cars, and farm
tractors, for which the tax credit may be a significant influence.
However, defense equipment and also output of commercial equipment--
which contains a substantial amount of military products not included
in the defense equipment series--have continued to rise, and the index
for total equipment including defense has changed little.
Cutbacks in output of steel and lumber seem to be over,
although inventories at steel mills remain exceptionally large. But,
with output of consumer durable goods down sharply from earlier levels
and output of equipment losing momentum, the decline in over-all
materials production (down 2.3 per cent from October to March) may not
be over. Manufacturers' inventories of purchased materials and supplies
at the end of February totaled $25.3 billion, somewhat smaller than in

II -11
January, but still 10 per cent greater than a yeari earlier. Assuming
the February decline was the beginning of an adjustment of supplies to
desired levels and assuming that the rise in inventories of work in
process continues to slacken, industrial production will probably decline
further.
Retail sales. Retail sales in March rose 3.2 per cent from
February, according to the Census Bureau "advance" estimates, with a
significant surge coming in the final week before Easter and the week
immediately after. Sales at durable goods stores were up 3.8 per cent
from February and at nondurable goods stores, up 3.0 per cent. Declines--
relatively small ones--were reported by department stores, farm machinery
dealers, and the miscellaneous grouping of durable goods stores.
February sales are now indicated to have been only slightly
below January, rather than 1.7 per cent below as indicated by the
"advance" figures reported four weeks ago. The sharp March gain,
coupled with the upward-revised February estimate lifted retail sales
in the January-March period to a level 1.7 per cent above the final
quarter of 1966, with sales of nondurable goods up 2.6 per cent and
durable goods down slightly, mainly because of the sharp decline in new
car sales. In the first half of April, retail sales were running some-
what above a year earlier.
Auto markets. Unit sales of new domestic automobiles in the
first quarter were at an annual rate of 7.3 million units, one-fifth
below the first quarter a year ago and 10 per cent below the fourth

II -12
quarter of 1966. This sales decline was about as great as during the
1960-61 readjustment, but far less than in the 1953-54 and 1957-58
cyclical declines.
Despite lagging sales of domestically produced cars, sales
of imported cars continued at a strong pace through March, bringing the
first quarter average to a seasonally adjusted rate of almost 720,000
units, somewhat above the fourth quarter 1966 rate, and 10 per cent
above a year ago.
The average assembly rate in the first quarter was reduced
to an annual rate of 6.8 million units, 20 per cent below the preceding
quarter, and 25 per cent below the rate a year earlier. As a result,
some liquidation of excessive dealer inventories was achieved; on a
seasonally adjusted basis, the ending March stock of new cars was 12 per
cent below the December 31 level, and 4 per cent below a year ago, though
still high in relation to the lower sales rate this spring.
Deliveries of domestic new cars in the first 20 days of April
were at a rate one-fourth above the low delivery rate a month ago, and
4 per cent above a year earlier. Sales during this 20-day period are
difficult to translate into an annual rate, partly because the closing
10-day period for April can vary widely. However, based on the mean
increase in the average sales in the last 10 days over the preceding
6 years, the seasonally adjusted annual rate for the entire month of
April would be about 7.8 million units. Sales a year ago were at an
annual rate of 7.9 million units. With production expected to reach an

II -13
annual rate of 7.7 million units, the ending April stock would show a
small decrease from March.
Prices of used cars sold at auction (seasonally adjusted)
changed little in March and early April, but remained somewhat below a
year earlier.
Consumer credit. The slowing in consumer credit expansion
may have halted in March. Early reports from commercial banks indicate
a rise in total instalment credit outstanding equal to or perhaps some-
what larger than, the February increase. February had marked the third
month in a row of decidedly weak demand for consumer credit, and the
$216 million rise in outstandings was the smallest in 5 years.
The indicated pick-up in March was mainly in the auto area
and reflected some improvement in new car sales, as well as a probable
further increase in the size of the average credit note. In February,
banks had reported a decline of $16 million and sales finance companies
$38 million in auto credit outstanding. Among major lenders, only
credit unions reported an increase. The over-all decline amounted to
$40 million, and was the first since September 1961.
The proportion of new cars bought on credit continues to run
well ahead of a year ago. In February--the latest month available--it
was 65 per cent, up from 60 per cent in February 1966. The year-to-year
differential was 4 percentage points in January, and for the year 1966
it was 3 points. The proportion has risen steadily since 1961, by 2 or
3 points each year, tending to provide an upward thrust to the volume
of auto credit throughout the expansion period.

II -14
The widening of the differential in early11967 was probably
due both to vigorous selling efforts by the auto dealers and general
easing of money and credit conditions. In such situations, the marginal
buyer and user of credit is typically attracted into the market.
Meanwhile, large sales finance companies report little change
from a year earlier in auto repossessions and inventories of repossessed
cars are about the same. And while losses per car are running a few
dollars higher than in early 1966, gross losses as a proportion of total
receivables have been somewhat smaller.
A development of considerable interest over the past year has
been the slowdown in personal loan activity in the face of continued
strong demand for consumer services. Personal loan credit outstanding
increased only 4 per cent in 1966, compared with a rise twice that large
in spending for consumer services. There are a number of reasons for
this, but the increased use of credit cards to finance travel and vaca-
tions is probably one of the more important. Instead of making personal
cash loans for these purposes as in the past, consumers have been charg-
ing the items to their credit cards. And these are reported in "other
consumer goods" credit in the Board's consumer credit estimates.
Personal income. Personal income rose $3.4 billion in March
to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $613 billion and was 7-3/4 per
cent above a year ago. For the first quarter as a whole, personal
income was more than 8 per cent above a year earlier. However, dispos-
able income exceeded the year earlier rate by only 6-3/4 per cent in the

II -15
first quarter because of the sharp rise in personal tax payments. In
real terms, after-tax income was up only 3-3/4 per cent from a year ago.
Wage and salary disbursements in March rose $2.2 billion,
following a rise of $500 million in the previous month. Manufacturing
payrolls advanced $500 million in March--mainly reflecting a modest rise
in average hourly pay, after a decline of more than $1 billion in February
when weekly hours were sharply reduced. Payrolls outside manufacturing
continued to rise in March in line with recent trends. The rise has been
particularly strong for State and local governments.
Transfer payments increased $700 million in March--half the
increase in February which had reflected a concentration of earlier-
than-usual payment of 1967 dividends on Veterans' life insurance. Medi-
care payments continued to rise but less rapidly than earlier.
Business inventories. Book value figures now available for
February--which are subject to imminent and possibly substantial
revision--show a nice offset between accumulation totaling about $400
million by manufacturers and net liquidation by trade concerns (retail
and wholesale combined) of nearly $400 million--leaving total business
inventories about unchanged. In January, business inventories increased
$1,050 million, and in the fourth quarter at a monthly average rate of
almost $1,600 million.
Despite the leveling off in inventories in February, the
over-all stock sales ratio rose appreciably further--to 1.59, the highest
level since early 1961--and 10 per cent above a year earller--as sales by

II -16
manufacturers and wholesalers declined and retail sales were about
unchanged. In March, with retail sales reported up sharply and ship-
ments of durable goods manufacturers moderately higher, the business
stock sales ratio may have declined.
The shift by trade concerns from a very high rate of inventory
accumulation in the fourth quarter--and in December in particular--to
little change in January and net liquidation in February reflected sub-
stantial adjustments for both durable and nondurable goods. Sizable
liquidation by auto dealers in both January and February made a major
contribution to the shift. In February, food and general merchandise
stores and durable goods wholesalers also reported appreciable stock
declines. The magnitude of the shift (from accumulation totaling $700
million in December to the nearly $400 million liquidation in February)
is so large as to be suspect, with both or either the December or
February figures probably aberrant in some degree.
Orders for durable goods. New orders for durable goods in
March remained at the reduced February level and 12 per cent below the
peak reached last September. A sharp drop in steel orders--reversing a
spurt in February--offset moderate gains in a number of other industries.
New orders for machinery and equipment--a special combination of indus-
tries making finished producers' equipment--increased 4 per cent,
following a steady decline over the preceding five months; the March
new order level remained about 10 per cent below last year's highs and
the order backlog declined somewhat further. New orders for defense

II -17
products were about unchanged from February and were close to the
year-earlier and average 1966 level.
Shipments rose somewhat in March, following a two-month
decline, with defense products accounting for most of the increase.
Unfilled orders decreased further, to a level about 3 per cent below the
December high. Steel mills accounted for half the March drop in the
durable goods backlog; other industries showed small declines except for
the defense products grouping where unfilled orders edged up to a new
high.
Business plant and equipment spending. According to the
March-early April McGraw-Hill survey of business plans, new plant and
equipment expenditures this year will total 5.6 per cent more than in
1966, Because of survey differences, this 5.6 per cent increase probably
does not represent an upward revision in business plans from the 3.9 per
cent rise shown for all business by the Commerce-SEC survey taken in late
January and February. The McGraw-Hill survey is limited to the large
firms in their industries and has a somewhat limited coverage of commer-
cial business.
Expenditures on new plant and equipment this year, 47 per
cent of which are reported to be for expansion of productive facilities,
are expected to increase capacity in manufacturing as a whole by 6 per
cent. as compared with a capacity increase of 7 per cent in 1966. Based
on reported expectations for an increase in unit sales of 5 per cent this
year, capacity would be less fully utilized than last year.

Construction activity. Outlays for new construction, which
were revised upward by about 2 per cent for January and February, edged
higher in March to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $73.3 billion.
Residential and other private construction expenditures changed little
in March, but public construction apparently increased further.
For the first quarter as a whole, construction outlays are
indicated to have risen about 2 per cent from their low in the fourth
quarter of last year. Residential construction expenditures, which lag
starts and which had accounted for most of the drop through the last
three quarters of 1966, were about unchanged; both private nonresidential
and public construction, however, rose to levels in excess of earlier
peaks reached in the first quarter of 1966. An unexpected factor in this
nonresidential development has been a rapid return to earlier advanced
levels by commercial construction. Also, industrial construction, which
had turned downward after mid-1966, has held fairly steady in recent
months.

Labor market. Lack of growth in real output in the first
quarter was reflected in a further easing of the labor market in March.
Nonfarm employment showed little increase and manufacturing employment
dipped for the second straight month. Total manufacturing employment
in March was off by 115,000 from January, and production worker jobs
were down by almost 150,000. With reports of further layoffs in selected
consumer durable goods industries, and unemployment insurance claims
continuing to run well above last year's levels, April employment data
(available next week) will likely show additional slackening in the
labor market, with a further erosion of manufacturing employment and a
probable increase in over-all unemployment.
Although the total unemployment rate remained virtually
unchanged in March--edging downward by 0.1 to 3.6 per cent--this move-
ment was somewhat misleading. A careful look at the household survey
data also indicates further general easing in the labor market. A
decline of about 400,000 in total employment--entirely among adults--
was accompanied by an almost equivalent drop in the civilian labor
force rather than a rise in the unemployment rate.
In contrast to the slight decline in the over-all unemployment
rate, the rate of insured unemployment, which is a senstive measure of
layoffs in manufacturing, was up slightly to 2.6 per cent in March.
Unemployment insurance claims continue to show an increasing spread over
last year; in the week ending April 15th, total claims were running
300,000 above a year ago.

II -20
Reflecting the improved level of starts, residential
construction expenditures are expected to play an important role in the
developing strength of over-all construction developments as the year
progresses. Apart from recent steps to promote greater ease in the
mortgage markets, other supporting factors for private construction as
a whole include the expected restoration of the investment tax credit
and more liberal depreciation allowances, and, in the case of public
constribtion, the announcement of release of additional funds which the
Administration had withheld last autumn.
Seasonally adjusted private housing starts edged 2 per cent
higher in March, following a sharp (6 per cent) upward revision for
February. The advance, which required a more than 50 per cent increase
in the unadjusted data, brought the seasonally adjusted annual rate in
March to 1.2 million, including farm starts. While this was appreciably
below the advanced January rate, it was enough to carry the first quarter
average as a whole to 1.2 million--still unusually low, but only barely
below the average for all of 1966.
The better than expected performance of housing starts in
March and evidence of revived optimism by builders lend support to the
view that sufficient momentum already has been attained in the easier
mortgage market environment to support at least a normal expansion in the
level of starts in the second quarter as a whole. This would insure a
seasonally adjusted rate of starts about the same as in the first quarter,
even though the seasonal adjustment factors rise considerably further

II -21
during most of the second quarter. On a month-to-month basis, however,
a temporary decline in the April seasonally adjusted rate still cannot
be ruled out, largely for technical reasons.
Regionally, the increase in starts in March was fairly
widespread, with only the Northeast states showing a decline. Neverthe-
less, owing mainly to an extremely sharp rise in January, the Northeast
led the rise for the first quarter as a whole.
Seasonally adjusted building permits rose somewhat more than
starts in March from an upward revised February rate. Permits for
multifamily structures, which had dropped even more sharply than single-
family permits in 1966, showed the greater relative rise in March, as
well as for the quarter as a whole.

Productivity and unit labor costs. Along with the decline in
manufacturing output on the first quarter, there was a parallel dip in
productivity. Although employers cut both hours of work and payrolls
in response to weakened sales and excessive inventories, the production
drop was larger than the reduction in man-hour input. As a result, output
per manhour declined between the fourth andfirst quarters.
The continued rise in hourly earnings in manufacturing, in com-
bination with the dip in production and productivity, have added to pressure
on unit labor costs. In the first quarter of this year, they averaged
4.7 per cent above a year earlier, the largest over-the-year increase in
almost a decade. With wages likely to continue to rise at a substantial
rate, it is unlikely that pressure on unit labor costs will ease until
the volume of production increases materially with a corresponding
increase in productivity.
Productivity in the private economy as a whole also has shown
little growth during the past year, and year-to-year increases became
progressively smaller throughout 1966. In the first quarter of 1967,
the increase over a year earlier dipped to 1.5 per cent, less than half
the rate of rise in early 1966 when output was expanding vigorously.

Wages and collective bargaining. Contract negotiatinns have
involved a much larger number of workers (nearly 1 million) and proceeded
far less smoothly thus far this year than last. Union demands for
substantial wage increases and improved fringe benefits are meeting with
considerable employer resistance. Negotiations with the trucking industry
involving 450,000 teamsters, the shopcraft nonoperating railroad brother-
hoods (136,000) and rubber (100,000) have resulted in strikes or the
threat of strikes. On the other hand, major contract settlements have been
reached in apparel, petroleum and meatpacking, and wages have been increased
for State and local government employees, hospital workers and nurses.
In general, the wage settlements so far this year start at about
4 per cent. In the manufacturing sector, contract settlements in the
apparel industry and scattered agreements in textiles, provide wage
increases of substantially more than 4 per cent. In the higher paid
petroleum and meatpacking industries, first-year wage rate increases
were about 4 per cent--in line with the average increase in settlements
reached in 1966,
Upward pressure on wages in manufacturing has tended to be
greater in the lower paid nondurable goods industries, where the effect
of the rise in the minimum wage in February has probably been a factor
contributing to the recent substantial increases in hourly earnings.
This pressure has been reflected in a 5.4 per cent rise in average hourly
earnings in nondurable goods manufacturing, considerably higher than the
3.5 per cent rise in durables over the past year. This differential is

II -24
not so large, however, if allowance is made for the large cutback in
overtime worked at premium pay in durables. Straight-time hourly earnings
in durable goods have risen 4.4 per cent over the year as compared with
5.6 per cent for nondurables.
Contract negotiations in manufacturing in the second quarter
will continue to be heavily concentrated in nondurables--rubber, apparel,
and paper. There will be some activity in electrical equipment in June,
but more pressure on wage rates in the durable goods sector will come in
the third and fourth quartess this year when contracts come up for
negotiation for nearly a million auto and machinery workers.

Increases in average hourly earnings also continue to be larger
in the generally lower paid nonmanufacturing industries than in manufacturing.
In the low paid laundry, hotels and motels industries, earnings were 8 to 9
per cent above a year earlier, reflecting in part the increased minimum
wage. In most other industries the increase has been somewhat less, but
only in construction has the rise been less than from 1965 to 1966.
Prices, The wholesale price index declined 0.3 per cent in
March--instead of showing no change as estimated by BLS a month ago. For
April, BLS is estimating a further decrease of 0.4 per cent, to 105.3
per cent of the 1957-59 average. March declines in prices of farm products
and foods proved to be larger than estimated earlier, and the industrial
commodity average was unchanged rather than up. In April, agricultural prices
continued downward and industrial commodities have remained stable.
The continuing sharp price decline brought the combined average
for farm products and processed foods and feeds to an estimated level in
mid-April which was 7 per cent below last September's high. For farm
products alone, the decline over that period amounted to 10 per cent and
it brought prices down to the lowest level since April 1965 (only 3-1/2
per cent above the low 1964 level). Reductions in prices of agricultural
commodities beginning last autumn have reflected to a major degree the
greatly improved domestic supply situation--particularly for livestock
and products (including poultry and eggs and milk as well as beef
cattle and hogs)--and to a lesser extent the substantial improvement
of world grain supplies with its concomitant easing of U.S. export
demands.

II -26
Average prices of industrial commodities in mid-April were
estimated at 106 per cent of the 1957-59 average, unchanged from March
and February and about 1.5 per cent above a year earlier. Since February,
prices of basic industrial materials have weakened again--following several
months of relative stability--with copper scrap and hides down sharply
and prices of cotton print cloth, wool tops, and some chemicals also
off. Prices of machinery, rubber, and paper products have continued to
move up, but generally at a slower pace than over the past year.
The Consumer Price index in March increased 0.2 per cent, to
115 per cent of the 1957-59 average. The March rise was a little faster
than the very slow up-creep of the preceding 4 months but it was well
below the monthly increases occurring from the beginning of 1966 to last
October. The moderate step-up in March occurred in large part because
food prices were unchanged, following earlier declines. Prices of nonfood
commodities rose moderately from February--with advances reported for
apparel, household furnishings, used cars, and gasoline--but the March level
for this group was unchanged from last November. Stability over this
latter period is in part a seasonal phenomenon. Prices of services
continued to rise at a sizable pace in March--accounting for more than
half of the increase in the total CPI--although, with costs of financial
services turning downward in March (primarily because of a drop in
mortgage interest rates) and with charges for utilities and public
transportation rising at a slower rate than, on average, in 1966, the
over-all increase in service prices has slowed somewhat from last year's
pace.

II -27
Food prices. Current production prospects suggest that food
prices will remain relatively stable in 1967, rather than averaging
higher as had been forecast earlier. Meat supplies will be larger than
expected earlier and poultry and eggs will be plentiful. Dairy prices
will probably hold around current levels, although the possibility of impor-
tant policy changes that may affect prices should not be discounted. Prices
of cereals and baked goods will probably show little change. Processors of
fruits and vegetables will probably try to hold these steady but weather
is always a big unknown until the new pack is underway.
Farm developments. Farmerst realized gross income in the first
quarter declined moderately on a seasonally adjusted basis from the record
$51.1 billion high of the fourth quarter of 1966, primarily because of
lower farm prices. Realized net income was off more sharply because of a
further rise in production expenses. Whether or not the first quarter
decline marks the beginning of a downtrend in farm earnings turns largely
on the size of 1967 crop, particularly the wheat and feed grain crops,
because with grain stocks no longer in surplus supply, farm prices will
be particularly sensitive to supply developments.

Present (tenuous) prospects for a large crop and larger supplies
of beef cattle on farms than earlier indicated point to a more pronounced
decline in prices of farm commodities in 1967 than had been forecast by the
Department of Agriculture in the November Outlook. As a result, cash
receipts may be no larger than 1966, or possibly lower, Government
payments will be down about a third by autumn because of smaller diversion
of grain acreages. In the meantime, no decline in prices paid by farmers
is in prospect.
Prices of meat animals beyond the first half of the year rests
largely on decisions of cattle producers--and the reliability of the pig
crop reports, a source of chronic uncertainty. At present, a somewhat
less than seasonal summer price rise in in prospect for hogs and fed
cattle with some strength developing in the fall. Hog producers have
reported production plans which would gradually reduce marketings this
summer to year earlier levels and in the fourth quarter to slightly less
than the relatively high marketings of a year earlier. Marketings
of cattle may follow a similar though less pronounced trend, although the
picture is far from clear beyond the summer.
Beef production was up 5 per cent in the first quarter with fed
beef up 8 to 9 per cent and cow beef down probably 10 per cent. With 4 per
cent larger marketings of fed beef planned for the second quarter (as
reported in April), total beef production in the summer may be at the
sale level as a year ago. If feedlot operators continue to reduce placements
on feed in line with the 3 per cent cut in the first quarter, beef production
by the fourth quarter, may drop below a year earlier. With the supply of
feeder cattle sufficient to keep feedlots filled, operators could move
in either direction.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL SITUATION
Bank credit. Growth in commercial bank credit in the first
half of April slackened considerably from the 20 per cent annual rate
in March. Available data for city banks suggest that the rate of in-
crease may have been a little more than half the March pace.
Loan demands were moderate despite large April tax payments
by corporations, and expansion in total loans, after allowance for usual
seasonal changes, appears to be continuing at close to the average rate
in recent months. Another factor which limited total bank credit expan-
sion in early April was a substantial decline in holdings of U.S. Govern-
ment securities, presumably reflecting in part sales of new tax bills
by underwriting banks as the Treasury sharply reduced its demand balances
prior to mid-month tax inflows.
This decline in bank holdings of Governments was more than
offset, however, by a huge increase in holdings of other securities at
city banks (see table). This increase suggests a growth rate for hold-
ings of these securities at all commercial banks considerably above even
the 30 per cent annual rate that prevailed in the first quarter. Part
of the April increase in these holdings was in Agency issues and parti-
cipations, the latter probably representing subscriptions to the new $900
million FNMA issue. But three-fifths of the increase was in municipals
maturing in more than one year, mainly at banks outside New York City.
Holdings of tax warrants and other short maturities, which accounted
for nearly half the first quarter increase in total city bank municipal

III -2
portfolios, showed little further change in early April, but information
is not available for judging to what extent this might have been the
usual seasonal trend. However, with time and savings deposit inflows
large, loan demands moderate, and yield spreads between short- and long-
er-term municipals widening, banks may be showing more interest in longer
maturities, but market reports indicate that such interest still does
not extend much beyond the 1-5 year area.

Reflecting moderate loan growth and rapid expansion in bank
holdings of Govermments and municipals in recent months, bank loan/deposit
ratios have declined. At the end of March the average ratio for all
commercial banks was 65.4 per cent, down 1.4 percentage points from the
September 1966 high. This is nearly half the average drop from peak to
low point in this ratio during earlier post-Accord periods of monetary

Ill -3
ease. While ratios at city banks have declined much more than those at
country banks, they had also increased faster during the period of re-
straint and they still remain relatively high by historical standards.
More direct measures of liquidity at city banks also show improvement
in recent months, but the ratio of liquid assets to total loans and
investments at these banks is still considerably below the level pre-
vailing in the early part of the 1961-66 expansion.
Business loans at city banks declined substantially in the
first two reporting weeks in April (ending April 12), reflecting a larger
than usual drop at New York City banks. A major part of the decline was
attributable to large loan repayments by manufacturers of machinery and
transportation equipment following a sharp rise in their borrowings in
March. Most major industry categories, however, continue to show only
usual seasonal movements or to exhibit somewhat weaker tendencies.
In the tax week ending April 19, business loans at banks in
New York City rose nearly $300 million--a moderate rise relative to the
step-up in tax payments this April. Total corporate tax payments for
the month, all of which were payable by the 19th, are estimated at $9.3
billion, or $4.4 billion more than last April, after deducting the $750
million maturing tax bills turned in for taxes this year. Corporations
apparently have used some of the proceeds of recent capital market
financings for meeting these payments, and they also ran off moderate
amounts of their recently increased holdings of CD's. Outstanding CD's
at New York City banks declined $212 million during the tax week, but
this was well within the past range of tax-period run-offs.

III -4
The prospectuses for major capital market financings indicate
that an unusually high percentage of new issues thus far this year was
for the purpose of repaying bank loans. However, outstanding term loans
at banks in New York City and in the Cleveland District rose slightly
further during this period. Considering the $9 billion year-over-year
increase in business tax payments over the first 4 months of 1967, it
appears that a sizable amount of the funds raised in recent capital
market financings was used to fund tax payments.
Real estate loans at city banks continued to decline in early
April as they have since late November. Although the rate of decline
beginning in March was only about half that in the first two months of
the year, there was no pickup in these loans after allowance for usual
seasonal changes.
Bank deposits. Total time and savings deposits at commercial
banks continued to expand in April at close to the 15 per cent annual
rate which prevailed in March, but less rapidly than in January and
February. The pace of the recent expansion has been sustained by fur-
ther acceleration in growth of consumer-type deposits, since deposits
of corporations and State and local governments, which accounted for
much of the growth earlier this year, have expanded relatively little
in recent weeks. Passbook accounts showed their usual seasonal decline
in early April, presumably reflecting withdrawals for income tax payments,
but over March these deposits had expanded at an 11 per cent annual rate,
following reversal in mid-February of the downtrend which had prevailed

III -4a
since early 1966. Growth in savings certificates and pther consumer-type
time deposits also accelerated in March, and continued at a rapid pace
in early April. In response to rapid depceit inflows and declining asset
yields, a few banks announced rate decreases in recent weeks.
Negotiable CD's rose in late March and declined in early April,
but showed only a small net rise over the period. Beginning in late
March, issuing banks sharply reduced their offering rates in all maturity
ranges, trimming the spread over the 90-day bill yield to the lowest level
since December 1964. These reductions, together with the relatively
unchanged level of outstandings in recent weeks, suggest that banks may
be relatively satisfied with current outstandings for a time unless loan
demand should pick up appreciably.
With Government deposits rising sharply in recent weeks, the pri-
vately held money stock has receded from its end-of-March peak. Between
mid-November and mid-April, the money stock had increased at an annual
rate of 3.5 per cent, but as compared with a year earlier, it was up
less than $500 million, or less than one-half of 1 per cent.

Corporate and municipal bond markets. Yields on new corporate
and municipal bonds advanced sharply last week to levels near or above
the earlier highs reached in late February and early March. Even at
these higher levels several recent new issues have met with a lukewarm
response from investors.

attitudes were affected by the unexpectedly favorablle economic news for
March, as well as by press reports that further near-term expansion of
U.S. forces in Vietnam is likely.
Earlier in April, corporate and municipal bond underwriters
had bid aggressively for new issues, apparently assuming that a cut in
the Federal Reserve discount rate, further ease in reserve policy, and
some reduction in the volume of security offerings from the hectic first
quarter pace would maintain the downward momentum of bond yields. Investors,
on the other hand, had increasingly resisted the attempts of underwriters
to anticipate future yield declines. As a result, unsold syndicate
balances of new issues expanded substantially. When expectations on
the economic outlook then strengthened and the forward calendar continued
to grow, underwriters attempted to trim their inventories by releasing
bonds from syndicate price restrictions. On five public utility issues
released to free market trading last week, yields in the secondary market
rose 10 to 13 basis points, and on some recently offered municipal issues
the yield adjustment ranged from 15 to 20 basis points.
In the corporate bond market, the April volume of publicly-
offered issues is now expected to aggregate over $1.3 billion, a record
for the month and more than double the volume in April 1966. This
figure is larger than earlier estimates due primarily to the late addition
to the calendar of a $200 million General Electric offering. Looking
beyond April, the forward calendar promises to remain very heavy. Offerings
already scheduled for May and June total $1.0 billion and $800 million
respectively; and several large industrial companies have indicated that

III -7
they plan shortly to register additional issues aggregating $350 million,
although the timing of these offerings has not yet been definitely
scheduled.

State and local government bond offerings in April are also
now expected to total $1.0 billion or more. While this is less than
in April a year ago, it is the fourth consecutive month in which volume
will have exceeded $1 billion, As in the corporate market, the large
volume of recent offerings has not been fully distributed, and under-
writers have attempted to cut-back inventories. Even so, the Blue
List of dealerst advertised inventories has remained at a very high level--
around $800 million--and the actual level of inventories, including
unadvertised bonds, is reportedly closer to $1.0 billion. If offerings

III -8
for May are no larger than the $850 million now estimated, however, there
is some prospect for at least modest relief from the present state of
market congestion.
Recent difficulties in the distribution of new municipal securities
have centered on longer maturities. Commercial banks, although still
very active in the municipal market, have reportedly restricted their
acquisitions largely to bonds with maturities of less than five years,
continuing their efforts to rebuild liquidity. Since fire and casualty
companies--the other major institutional purchaser of municipal bonds--
have also apparently restricted their purchases of long-maturity muaicipals
during recent weeks, yields on longer maturity issues have risen substan-
tially relative to those on short maturities.

Flows to depositary-type intermediaries. Net savings flows to
depositary-type financial intermediaries remained in record volume during
March, as in February. Moreover, both savings and loan associations
and mutual savings banks had sizeable net inflows during the first 10 days
of April, which contrasts sharply with the same period a year ago when
these two types of institutions experienced a net outflow of more than
$1 billion.

Despite the large net savings inflows, mortgage acquisitions
at S&L's continued to lag through the first quarter, as funds were
allocated principally to the rebuilding of liquid assets and the
reduction of indebtedness. As the following source and use table shows,
S&L's added only about one-third as much to the value of their mortgage
portfolio as during the first quarters of the two preceding years,
whereas they repaid more than $2 billion of their debt with the Home Loan

III -10
Also, by increasing their holdings of cash and government securities
relative to savings capital, the S&L's increased their liquidity ratio
to 10 per cent, up from the postwar low of 9 per cent reached in August
of last year. Since World War II, this liquidity ratio has declined
steadily, and in the 1960-65 period averaged about 11.5 per cent.

Complete first quarter data are not yet available for savings
banks. But because their liquidity positions were augmented in 1966 by
the earlier improvement of their savings flows (relative to S&L's) they
have moved more aggressively to allocate funds to capital markets this
year. Their net acquisitions of mortgages totaled $780 million in theI

III -11
first quarter about 4 per cent more than in the like period of 1966
(when net acquisitions dropped about $200 million below those in the
first quarters of 1964 and 1965). In addition, they acquired about
$750 million of corporate securities, more than the $680 million added
to their portfolios during all of the preceding five years. This
heavy interest in corporate securities reflected the relative paucity
of available mortgages, the record volume of new corporate issues, and
apparently a desire to hold a larger share of total assets in marketable
securities. Small increases in cash and decreases in holdings of
Governments left the aggregate liquidity positions of the mutuals
essentially unchanged from the end of 1966 at 10.3 per cent, a relatively
low ratio historically.
While some industry observers had thought it possible that
the combination of very large savings flows, gradually improving
liquidity positions and high dividend rates relative to the level
of mortgage rates would cause depositary-type institutions to reduce
rates paid for savings, only a few have done so thus far. One small
savings bank in upper New York State has reduced its passbook rate
from 5 to 4-1/2 per cent and two commercial banks in New York City
have reduced the rate on consumer CD's below the 5 per cent ceiling.
At savings and loan associations the changes have been more
numerous and widespread but do not represent any significant trend
toward lower dividend rates. According to reports from the Home
Loan Banks, five associations, in the west and southwest, reduced their
passbook rate generally to 4-1/2 per cent, and about 45 associations,

III -12
mostly in the southeast and southwest, have reduced their maximum
certificate account rate from 5-1/4 to 5 per cent. On the other
hand, about 40 associations in the northeast and northwest actually raised
their passbook rates during the first quarter, in order to meet
earlier rate advances initiated by competing types of institutions,
Industry sources for all three types of institutions report
the existence of some firms which were on the verge of reducing rates
for the second quarter, but which then refrained from doing so partly
in the belief that the regulatory agencies would lower the ceilings
at mid-year. While the squeeze on profits of savings institutions,
arising from narrowed spreads between savings and mortgage rates, has
been clearly reflected in lower allocations to reserves and surplus
accounts, particularly among the S&L's, thus far this squeeze seems to
have been less severe than some industry spokesmen had predicted. This
fact, together with the fear that massive outflows might result from
unilateral rate reductions, no doubt accounts for the relatively small
number of institutions that have reduced rates.
Mortgage market developments. With the resumption of large
net inflows of loanable funds to major lender groups in recent months
and with liquidity positions continuing to improve, mortgage yields have
been under substantial downward pressure. In early April, this develop-
ment received further support from the Federal Reserve discount rate cut
and also from a 1/4 per cent reduction in the rate charged on outstanding
advances by the Federal Home Loan Banks. During March, when the more
liberal 5-1/2 per cent rate was initially introduced, it had applied
only to new advances.

III -13
Although the decline in the FRA secondary market yield series in
March (to 6.35 per cent) was less than the average decline in the previous
two months, it amounted to 11 basis points and was one of the largest on
record. The yield decline was associated with a reduction in average
discounts to 3 percentage points, 4 points lower than last November and
the lowest since November 1965 when the regulatory maximum contract rate
was 5-1/4 per cent. During the extended period of lull from early 1963
through most of 1965, discounts had averaged somewhat less than 2 per cent.
Interest rates on conventional mortgages (FHA series) also declined
in March by another 5 basis points for loans on both new and existing
homes. While less than the 10 basis point declines in February, the
latest reduction brought the averages down to 6.45 and 6.50 per cent,
respectively. Because of the sharp over-all rise last year, however,
these rates were still about 65 basis points above the averages that had
prevailed in 1963-65. In the case of secondary yield series, the spread
in March from the pre-October 1965 plateau continued to be even greater--
90 basis points.
In March, there were also indications of further liberalization
of both loan-to-price and maturity terms for home loans, according to
the Federal Home Loan Bank Board. This reflected the relative scarcity
of mortgages currently being generated and borrower hesitation in the
fact of the extremely fluid conditions obtaining and the still high
level of interest rates. As a result, in the case notably of existing-
home loans, loan amounts in recent months have apparently reached new

III -14
highs. At the same time, offerings to the Federal National Mortgage
Association of mortgages for purchase in the secondary market have
dwindled considerably and this trend-malong with some pick-up in sales
by FNMA--was continuing in April.

Stock market. Acter declining moderately in the weeks just
prior to the mid-April income tax date, stock prices, as measured by
Standard and Poor's 500 stock index, rose steadily through 9 trading
days to reach a new 1967 high of 93.11 on April 25. The further advance
carried the index to a level 27 per cent above last year's October low
and only about I per cent below the all-time high reached in early
February 1966. At the currently hgher prices, the price-earnings ratio
for Standard and Poor's composite index, based on fourth quarter 1966

III -15
earnings seasonally adjusted, was 16.9 which compares with a ratio of
13.0 at the October low and 17,9 at the February 1966 high. Since
early October 1966, dividend stock yields have fallen by about 70 basis
points and the spread between these yields and those on newly issued
corporate bonds has widened by about 40 basis points.
Both blue chip and glamor stocks have participated in the
further market rise, with autos, TV producers, and air transport
manufacturers among the outstanding industrial performers. Trading
volume, which rose along with stock prices, averaged about 10 million
shares in the third week of April, slightly below the daily average for
March. Through the first half of April, when stock prices generally were
declining, daily volume averaged about 8.5 million shares.
Some of the weakness in stock prices early in April apparently
reflected selling by individuals to obtain funds for the payment of
income taxes, as well as to nail down long-term capital gains on stocks
acquired near the October low. Weakness generated by such selling was
apparently accentuated by continued talk of recession at the time and by
the larger than expected drop in the first quarter profits reported
by a number of key industrial companies. Subsequently, however, as
mid-month selling slacked off and data accumulated suggesting that the
economy had regained some buoyance in March, stock prices began to move
up. Apparently, the March evidence helped to rene w market expectations
of a resurgence in economic activity during the second half of the
year. At the same time a more complete run-down of corporate earnings
reports seemed to indicate that on balance the results were no worse
than had been generally anticipated.

III -16
Net debit balances, as measured by the New York Stock Exchange's
margin panel series (first published in February), which had increased
by $120 million in February rose by another $80 million in March,
However, from the end of October last year through January customers' margin
debt had declined by $100 million, so that over this 5-month period, the
increase in margin debt measured by this series has been only $100 million.
Purpose loans at banks rose by about $25 million in March though they
remained about $45 million below their early October 1966 total.
U.S. Government securities market. Since early April yields
on intermediate- and long-term Treasury obligations have risen around 20
basis points, while Treasury bill rates have declined around 25 basis
points. Currently, yields on long-term Treasury bonds are at or very
close to their 1967 highs, while 3-month Treasury bill rates are at their
lowest level since November 1964.

The rise in Treasury bond yields in recent weeks has occurred
against a background of improved business indicators and continued
additions of new issues to the corporate bond calendar. The approach
of the Treasury's May refunding and associated talk of a possible pre-
refunding of other Treasury issues maturing later in the year has also
exerted a cautionary influence on the market, especially in the inter-
mediate area. A further weakening influence has been the expectation
of another sale of FNMA participation certificates before the end of
fiscal 1967. On the basis of the January 1967 Budget projections,
such an issue could total around $900 million.
In this market environment dealers have been willing sellers
of coupon issues and have reduced their holdings of issues due in more
than 1-year from just under $800 million in late March to $550 million
on April 25. A large part of this decline was accounted for by System
and Treasury trust fund purchases totaling about $160 million. Other
demand was generally light, although a large New York City bank made
sizable purchases of intermediate-termnotes in mid-April.
Treasury bill rates, which had moved persistently lower during
March, continued to decline on balance following the reduction in the
discount rate announced on April 5. Easier money market conditions--including
ready availability of dealer financing at lower rates--along with strong
market demand for bills from a wide range of investors--notably from public
funds temporarily investing seasonal tax receipts--combined to depress
bill rates. This demand was supplemented by large System purchases of

III -18
bills aroud mid-April and by sizable foreign official account buying
over the course of the month. Thus, dealer inventories in bills were
reduced to their lowest levels in several months, even though the dealers
were aggressive bidders in the regular weekly auctions.
Interest rates on short-term market instruments other than
bills also continued to fall in April--in some cases by as much as
50 basis points--as the table shows:

Treasury finance. The Treasury is expected to announce the terms
of its May refunding on April 26; a pre-refunding of other issues maturing
beyond May is also anticipated. The terms of the offering and indications
of early market response will be noted in the Greenbook supplement.
Federal budgetary developments. Budgetary figures are diverging
from those shown in the January Document. We now expect the national
accounts (NIA) deficit to be around $6.3 billion for fiscal 1967, some
$2.5 billion more than was estimated in January. The difference is
primarily attributable to an indicated decline in corporate profits tax
accruals. Aggregate expenditures are now estimated only about $.5 billion
above the earlier figure, with higher than expected defense purchases
being partially offset by lower than expected civilian expenditures.
In contrast, the expected cash deficit has declined slightly
since January. The reduction in estimated cash revenue is about $1 billion,
much less than that shown in the NIA accounts. The main reason for the
difference is that profits tax accruals (NIA concept) reflect declines in
corporate profits much faster than cash tax payments. These cash receipts
in the first half of this year are still high because of the large final
payments on last year's liabilities. There also have been some accelera-
tions of tax payments which were not allowed for in the budget, and are
not shown in the accrual basis NIA budget. The projected decline in
revenue appears to be more than offset by a $1.5 billion decline in cash
payments as against earlier expectations. This is mainly due to the unex-
pectedly large repayments of Federal Home Loan Bank advances by savings
and loan institutions.

III -20
As measured by the high employment budget, it is now
apparent that fiscal policy is becoming very expansionary in 1967.
This budget is expected to move about $9 billion into deficit between
1966 and 1967, whether on a calendar or fiscal year basis. (It is
assumed in this projection that the surtax will not be passed, that
the investment credit and accelerated depreciation will be restored
earlier than was expected, that the increase in social security benefits
will be smaller and will take effect later than expected, and that
spending will be somewhat above the level projected in the Document).
It should also be noted that since GNP seems to be falling short of its
high employment level in the first three quarters of the year, we expect
the actual NIA deficit to be even larger than the full employment
deficit.

U.S. balance of payments. The balance of payments was in
substantial deficit in the first quarter, though the amount was less
than suggested by the earlier reports for February and March. Before
seasonal adjustment, the liquidity deficit for the quarter was $250
million, and the official settlements deficit was about $1-1/4 billion.
Seasonally adjusted, the two deficits would be about $600 million and
over $1-1/2 billion, respectively.
Weekly data for April (to the 19th) have continued to reflect
substantial deficits.
The full extent of the underlying deficit on the liquidity
basis has been masked for some time by shifts of foreign official
accounts out of U.S. assets that are classified as liquid into other
assets (principally certificates of deposit or Government Agency
obligations) that are counted as non-liquid. In addition there
have been advance repayments by foreign governments of U.S,
Government loans, and a variety of other special transactions.
Last year the amount of these transactions that tended to improve
the liquidity deficit was $1.4 billion, and in the fourth quarter
alone it was nearly $600 million. Without this assistance, therefore,
the liquidity deficit for the year would have been about $2.8 billion,
and in the fourth quarter alone it would have been $1.1 billion
(seasonally adjusted). The effect of these official transactions
on the results for the first quarter of this year is not yet fully
known, but such special receipts were probably above the quarterly

IV -2
average of last year. If so, the seasonally adjusted liquidity deficit
in the first quarter after taking account of special receipts was proba-
bly not much different from that of the fourth quarter of 1966, i.e.,
on the order of $1 billion.
It is difficult to reconcile the lack of improvement in the
overall balance with the gains shown by the figures on the trade
balance and bank lending that are now available for the January-March
period. Merchandise exports were at very high rates in January and
February, and though there was a slight decline in March exports for
the quarter were at an annual rate of about $31 billion, up 4 per cent
from the previous quarter, Imports were also down slightly in March;
for the quarter as a whole they were unchanged from the fourth quarter
of 1966 at $26.7 billion. Thus, the export surplus of somewhat over
$4 billion (annual rate) was considerably better than the approximately
$3 billion registered for the final quarter of last year. For the full
year 1966 the trade surplus was $3.7 billion.

However, it may be more difficult than earlier anticipated
to make further gains in the trade accounts as the year progresses.
The decline in U.S. imports from the peak rates of last September
through January has been quite moderate considering the much lower
rate of domestic inventory accumulation and the 2.4 per cent fall
from October to February in the materials component of the U.S.
industrial production index. Further reductions in imports are
still likely to occur as a lagged response to the easing of the
demand and supply situation in this country that began late last
year. Imports would resume their upward course, however, if there
were a rapid upturn in domestic demand. On the other hand, somewhat
weaker growth rates in major industrial countries than had been
anticipated would have the effect of reducing their purchases from
the U.S., reducing their contribution to the buying power of less
developed countries, and increasing their incentives to penetrate
U.S. and other markets. As noted below, U.S. exports to the non-OECD
countries rose rapidly in 1966, but those countries will probably be
less able to expand further their purchases from the U.S. or other
countries this year.
With respect to foreign claims reported by U.S. banks, there
was a sizable short-term outflow in March, as would be expected on a
seasonal basis. Taken together with inflows in January and February,
the net inflow reported by banks for the quarter (seasonally adjusted)
was under $150 million. Inflows of the banks' own funds were somewhat
larger. New long-term loan commitments have diminished this year, so

IV -4
that disbursements on longer-term credits are likely to continue to
be lower than repayments. At the end of March leeway under the VFCR
program for banks amounted to about $1.1 billion.
Net U.S. purchases of foreign securities in the first
quarter have been about normal, averaging less than $100 million per
month. The largest activity has been sales here of new Canadian
bonds. U.S. investors have continued a moderate liquidation of their
holdings of foreign equity securities. There has also been a con-
tinuation of foreign purchases of bonds issued by U.S. companies to
finance their direct investments abroad, though the amount in the
first quarter was less than $100 million.
At this time there are still many major international trans-
actions for which no first quarter data are available, including
military expenditures, U.S, Government aid, direct investment capital
outflows and income receipts, and other types of non-bank capital
flows. The explanation of continued large deficits may be found in
these items. However, there may also be a repetition of the large
unexplained negative errors and omissions entry that appeared in the
balance of payments accounts for the fourth quarter last year. This
could reflect a rebuilding of sterling balances by U.S. non-banks or
a lengthening of leads and lags in commercial transactions with Britain.
Very large deficits on the official transactions basis were
registered in the first half of April as U.S. banks resumed repayments
of borrowed funds to their European branches. Some $350 million was
returned in the two-week period. The reflow of borrowings was inter-
ruped in mid-April, but might be expected to resume if short-term rates
in the U.S. move down relative to Euro-dollar rates.

Changes in composition of U.S. imports. (The leveling off
in U.S. imports in January and February appears to have involved some
shrinkage of imports of crude materials. Previously, from the second
half of 1965 to the second half of 1966, these had risen in value much
less percentagewise than total imports. (A substantial part of the
"Other" imports in the table would be counted in the end-use classifica-
tion as "industrial supplies and materials"; imports of such manufactured
and semi-manufactured materials have increased much more than those of
"crude materials.") The data used in this table are not seasonally
adjusted; probably the narrowing of the very large year-over-year in-
crease in imports of machinery and transport equipment from over 60 per
cent to about 40 per cent reflects the rapid rise in this group from
late 1965 into the early months of 1966 as well as a recent slowing in
their rise.

In terms of origins, recent year-over-year increases have
been relatively slow for imports from Asia outside Japan and from
Latin America. Imports from Japan in January and February were 15 per
cent above corresponding months a year earlier; however the rise to a
higher level of these imports ended last summer, and since then they
have declined more than seasonally. No significant slowing in the rise
of U.S. imports from Europe is evident in the comparison of January-
February figures with those of a year ago; seasonally adjusted data to
measure recent changes more sensitively are not available.

Imports of other industrial countries. The pace of import ex-
pansion in other major industrial countries slowed during 1966 and probably
into the first few months of 1967. The primary influences behind this

IV -7
development were the fall-off of aggregate demand in Britain until the
turn of the year and the decline in German total demand which apparently
continued at least through March. Easing of demand in the economies of
some smaller European countries -- including the Netherlands, Belgium,
Sweden and Spain -- contributed to the general slackening in international
trade, as did also the unexpectedly slow growth of economic activity in
France.
Only in Japan and Italy was there continued rapid growth of
economic activity and of imports through 1966 and into the early months of
1967. At a slower pace, imports also continued to grow in France and
Switzerland. Imports to Canada increased rapidly in the fourth quarter of
1966 and on into January, but this upsurge consisted in large part of a
sharp rise in Canadian imports of motor vehicles and parts under the
Canadian-U.S. Automotive Agreement.

In Britain, earlier indications of a bottoming out of the
brief recession that began in mid-1966 are confirmed by later data.
While total industrial production (preliminary) fell back one point in
February to its December level, manufacturing output remained at the
January level of 133 (1958 = 100). Upturns for steel and other metals,
after a low reached last November, and for textiles and related industries
after December, reflect a diminution of pressures to reduce inventoris of
major materials.
There was a moderate recovery in consumer expenditures in the
three months through February, and public investment expenditures --
mainly by nationalized industries and local authorities -- are continu-
ing to expand rapidly, at a two-year trend rate of 8.5 per cent in volume
terms, according to U.K. Treasury estimates. The Budget for 1966-67
announced this month made no changes in taxation or any other provision
for reflationary measures.
It is not clear whether imports have begun to react to the
strengthening of aggregate demand in Britain, because the removal of the
10 per cent surcharge in November caused a bulge in imports around the
year-end. By March total imports were down to about the average of the
preceding six months (September-February).
German imports declined steadily from October through March
(latest). In the fourth quarter they were already lower than in late
1965, and by that time even nonfood consumer goods imports -- in recent
years the category of steadiest growth -- were less than a year earlier.
No pick-up in German domestic demand has yet appeared. In-
dustrial production declined further in February and (as seasonally

IV -9
adjusted by OECD) was 7 per cent below the plateau of March-July 1966.
New orders received in February were little changed from January, and
for the two months together were at a new low.
A government statement issued on April 12 announced that the
Ministers of Finance and Economics had been instructed to prepare addi-
tional spending measures to be used to stimulate the economy later in the
year if that should prove necessary. Earlier, both President Blessing
and the Chancellor had opposed the Economic Council's recommendation for
further fiscal action. Also, despite the Bundesbank's readiness to fi-
nance the Federal deficit, instructions had previously been given to
government departments to hold their current expenditures 25 per cent
below 1966 monthly averages pending Parliamentary approval of the budget.
These instructions were rescinded on April 12, and at the same time the
States and local authorities were urged to push forward their own expendi-
ture plans even if this required increased borrowings. On April 13 the
Bundesbank cut its discount rate to 3-1/2 per cent; this was the third
reduction made this year.
Trade of industrial countries with others. While import growth
was slowing in most industrial countries, the imports of many countries
in Latin America, Asia, and Africa continued to rise strongly throughout
1966. During 1965 these countries' sales to the industrial countries had
increased while their own purchases had not risen much, Last year the
situation was reversed: export sales by the outside countries to the in-
dustrial nations increased relatively little, but the latter found active
markets in the less developed countries.

IV -10
As the upper part of the following table indicates, Japan and
Italy were the only two of the ten leading industrial countries whose
imports from non-OECD countries in the final quarter of 1966 were sub-
stantially higher than a year earlier. U.S. imports from non-OECD
countries rose strongly up to the third quarter. In the other direction,
relatively large gains in exports to non-OECD countries from late 1965 to
late 1966 were experienced by Japan, Italy, Germany, and the United States.

Industrial countries' exports in recent months. Exports of
most industrial countries continued to increase up to December or January
despite the slackening growth of their aggregate imports from each other
and from the outside world. With few exceptions, exports in February
and (where available) March were off a little from the peaks, even though
first-quarter averages were up from the preceding quarter.
The export growth of Germany and the U.K. has been spurred on
by the fall in domestic demand within those economies. With capacity
utilization in German industry at 83 per cent in the last quarter of
1966 compared to 88 or 89 per cent during 1964 and 1965, German producers
particularly have reportedly been pushing exports in order to sustain
production levels. With German imports down, the country's trade balance
rose to a surplus of over $4.5 billion, annual rate, in January-February
1967 from $1.1 billion a year earlier. (Adjusted to the balance-of-
payments basis by omission of freight on imports, the surpluses were
still larger.) Britain reduced its trade deficit in the first quarter
of 1967 to $0.1 billion, annual rate, balance-of-payments basis, compared
to $0.8 billion a year earlier.

Japanese exports peaked out last December (as seasonally adjusted
by the Bank of Japan). By March they were down 4 per cent from the fourth-
quarter average. With imports still rising rapidly, the first-quarter
trade balance (with imports c.i.f.) was a deficit of $0.6 billion, annual
rate, compared to a surplus a year earlier at a rate of $0.5 billion.
Exports of European countries that customarily send a sub-
stantial part of their total exports to Germany and the U.K. were adversely
affected last year. Exports of many of the smaller countries leveled off
in the course of the year. However, around the year-end renewed expan-
sion appeared to be occurring in exports of some, especially the

IV -13
Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland. In the case of the Netherlands,
this development may in part have been a by-product of the easing of
internal demand.
