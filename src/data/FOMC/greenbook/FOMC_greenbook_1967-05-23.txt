SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK
Outlook for economic activity
The outlook continues to be for a small gain in real GNP
this quarter followed by a stronger third quarter. Sharp downward
revision of retail sales figures for March and other recent indications
of sluggishness have cooled some of the earlier exuberance in business
and financial expectations. However, despite the recent unfavorable
turn of the news, we believe the progressively slower rate of inventory
accumulation since the beginning of the year has begun to lay the ground-
work for a resumption of more rapid economic growth later on.
Substantial increases in final demand are estimated for the
second quarter, partly offset by a continuation of the inventory adjust-
ment. Some decumulation of stocks is now anticipated for the second
quarter. Inventory liquidation is likely to continue in the third
quarter, particularly if auto sales pick up in anticipation of a strike,
but such liquidation should exert much less of a downward drag on economic
activity than in the two preceding quarters. Gains in government and
private final demands over the summer are expected to be at the same fast
pace as in the second quarter. We project a rise in real GNP of 4 to 5
per cent, annual rate, which would be sufficient to end downward pressures
on industrial output and employment.
Outlays by consumers in the second and third quarters are
expected to show somewhat larger increases than earlier, partly because
of greater strength in auto purchases. Even with an expected resumption

I-2
of rapid advance in personal income over the summer, the strength
projected in consumer buying would result in a drift off in the savings
rate from the exceptionally high level reached in the first quarter.
In addition, developments in Vietnam are resulting in larger
defense outlays than previously expected. And our expectations continue
to be for some further expansion in residential construction, for little
change in fixed capital investment, and for sharply rising State and
local spending.
Outlook for resource use and prices
The pause in over-all economic expansion in recent months
has continued to exert downward pressure on industrial production. Out-
side the auto and defense sectors, cutbacks in output were widespread
among final products and materials in April, resulting in a half-point
decline in total industrial production and a full-point decline--from
87 to 86 per cent--in the rate of manufacturing capacity utilization.
Further moderate declines in industrial production and capacity utiliza-
tion are still in prospect for the next few months, while the inventory
adjustment is being completed. Moreover, the unemployment rate is likely
to rise moderately further. The civilian labor force, which declined
from December to March, began rising again in April and is expected to
continue expanding at a substantial rate, while industrial employment
is tending lower.
Cutbacks in employment and working-time per employee have
brought manufacturing menhours down along with production, and productivity

I -3
has shown little net change since December, while wage rates and hbutly
earnings have continued on up at a sizable pace. As a result, unit
labor costs have risen substantially. These trends are likely to hold
in the near future. Upward pressures on unit labor costs are likely to
continue until production turns up vigorously, with the usual concomitant
increase in productivity.
Despite these upward cost pressures, wholesale prices of
industrial commodities were stable in March and April. Stability in
the over-all total resulted in part from declines in sensitive industrial
materials, while prices of some other materials and products continued to
rise. With domestic and world supplies of metals and other basic mate-
rials generally much more ample than a year ago, and with--as yet--little
prospect for renewal of expansion in business equipment demands, indus-
trial price increases are likely to be moderate.
Sharp declines in prices of farm products through April
resulted in a decline in the over-all wholesale price index and acted
to slow appreciably the rise in the consumer price index. But this
moderating influence may be waning. The earlier marked expansion in
output of livestock and products has tapered off as producers have begun
to react to the sharp fall-off in prices received and sustained relatively
high costs of feed. Supplies of many livestock products are expected to
work down to around year earlier levels by summer or autumn, and while
crop prospects now appear favorable, wholesale prices of farm products
and foods may generally stabilize or increase. At retail, average food
prices are now expected to rise more than seasonally this summer, and

I -4
the consumer price index may then rise faster than during the period
from last October through March.
Outlook for banking
Bank credit in May is expected to be essentially unchanged
or only slightly higher. Corporate tax payments in May are projected
about $2 billion less than last year, reducing the amount of tax-related
loan demands. This, along with continued business inventory adjustments
and the high level of capital market financings, might even lead to some
net business loan repayments this month. Demands for other types of
loans are also likely to remain relatively weak, but bank security port-
folios will probably rise further, although at a reduced rate.
In June, corporate tax payments are expected to amount to
over $15 billion--about the same as last year--which should tend to
lead to a repetition of last year's temporary bulge in loan demand.
Banks may be under some temporary pressure in meeting these customer
loan demands with their large CD maturities and with their Treasury
balances expected to continue to decline because of rising Government
expenditures. This pressure might induce some increased bank efforts
to expand CD sales, to obtain other short-term borrowings and to liqui-
date some securities. Over the somewhat longer run, bank competition
for CD funds is likely to be moderate so long as loan demand remains
weak and inflows from passbook savings and time deposits other than
large CD's continue strong.

I-5
Capital markets outlook
New uncertainties have developed in capital markets in the
wake of the Treasury's request for statutory leeway to breach the 4-1/4
per cent interest rate ceiling on U.S. Government bonds and to extend
the maturity of notes (which are not subject to the ceiling) to 10 years.
Prior to the Secretary's testimony, bond yields had shown some signs of
leveling off, following a substantial advance extending over more than a
month. But with the May and June calendars in both corporate and munic-
ipal markets still very heavy and with the FNMA expected to announce a
$900 million offering of participation certificates later this month,
even this earlier tendency toward stability in bond yields might have
been short-lived.
The initial reaction of corporate underwriters to the Treasury's
request has been to defer offering of a few negotiated issues scheduled
for the current week. These postponements are likely to be strictly
temporary, however. Thus in the short-run, the supply pressures on bond
yields seem likely to persist.
In the secondary mortgage market, scattered yield advances
have been reported recently for FHA and VA home mortgages. These changes
seem to have been made more in anticipation of tightening credit markets
later in the year than to any current shortage of mortgage credit. At
life insurance companies, most commitments now being made are for delivery
either in late 1967 or beyond; for the limited volume of uncommitted funds
that are available for investment currently, corporate obligations have
been more attractive than mortgages.

I-6
Among depositary-type lenders, recent data show no slackening
in the net growth of consumer-type savings accounts. The below normal
share of these inflows being allocated to mortgages at savings and loan
associations and savings banks through April was apparently attributable
more to the relative shortage of immediately available mortgages than to
the preemption of funds by other types of borrowers. However, the high
corporate bond yields, which have attracted savings bank funds in record
volume recently, suggests that as mortgages do become more readily avail-
able they will have to provide liberal returns in order to attract a
normal share of such funds.
International developments
Preliminary U.S. payments results for the first quarter of
1967, announced today, show a seasonally adjusted deficit of $540 million
on the liquidity basis. The figure was held down by special transactions
in the absence of which it would have been about $1 billion. The deficit
on the official reserve transactions basis was a record $1,830 million.
In April, the liquidity deficit apparently increased, owing mainly to
the absence of favorable special transactions. The official settlements
deficit remained very large last month, as U.S. banks further reduced
their liabilities to their foreign branches.
Compared with the fourth quarter, the first-quarter liquidity
deficit before special transactions was little changed. Capital outflows
increased, while net exports of goods and services rose from an annual
rate of $4.5 billion to about $5.4 billion.

I- 7
Some adverse influences that were present in the first
quarter--unusually large outflows of U.S. private capital into foreign
securities, and high food imports--may now be waning. On the other
hand, the first quarter included some temporarily favorable elements,
including large foreign official placements in nonliquid U.S. assets
and further reflows of U.S. bank credit in January-February which gave
way to a renewed outflow in March. Also, military expenditures in Asia
are doubtless continuing to increase.
In the months ahead, a substantial further increase in net
exports will be required to hold the rates of deficit for the full year
1967 down--as earlier projected--to about $2 billion on the liquidity
basis and $3-1/2 billion on the official reserve transactions basis.
Recent business developments abroad still leave the U.S.
export outlook uncertain. Prospects for a gradual pickup of demand in
European economies are brightened by the further discount rate reductions
in Germany and Britain this month, as well as by some indications that
the recessions in these countries may have begun to bottom out earlier
this year. The OECD staff now estimates that real GNP may rise from
the first half of 1967 to the second half almost as much in OECD Europe
(4 per cent annual rate) as in the United States (4-1/2 per cent). For
OECD Europe as a whole this would constitute a marked acceleration,
after growth in the current half year at a rate of only 1-1/2 per cent;
for Germany alone it would represent a sharp turnaround from decline to
advance.

I -8
But it is still uncertain whether the monetary and fiscal
actions Germany has taken up to now are sufficient to get this result.
Also, recovery in Britain thus far has been slow, and a recent deterio-
ration in the U.K., trade balance, coupled with the need to make further
large repayments this year to the IMF, seem to insure that Britain's
economic policies will remain cautious. Thus in general we may expect
the recent weakening tendencies in world markets to be arrested, but no
early renewal of boom conditions in Europe should be looked for.

THE ECONOMIC PICTURE IN DETAIL
The Nonfinancial Scene
Gross national product, Gains of $8 billion and $14 billion
in GNP now projected for the second and third quarters are about the
same as our previous estimates. After a first quarter which showed
a slight decline in real GNP, aggregate real output is projected to
rise at about a 1-1/2 per cent annual rate in the second quarter and a
4-1/2 per cent rate in the third quarter. The trend of prices as
reflected in the GNP deflator is assumed to continue upward at around
the first quarter rate.
Revised first quarter estimates of GNP (to be released by
the Department of Commerce May 18) incorporate a number of changes
which are largely offsetting. The first quarter figures now show an
increase of $4.4 billion in current dollar GNP, and a slight decline
after adjusting for price changes. The major revisions are as follows:
Consumer expenditures for nondurables have been lowered by about $2
billion, reflecting downward revisions in retail sales for February
and March; this results in an upward revision in the saving rate to
6.5 per cent, up from the 5.9 per cent rate in the fourth quarter.
Defense expanditures, which previously had been estimated as increasing
by $3.3 billion, now show a rise of $4.2 billion. And net exports
have been increased up from $4.9 billion to $5.4 billion, with exports
up sharply and imports up only moderately.

II -2
Our expectation is that any continued sluggishness in
consumer spending for nondurables will be compensated for by greater
strength in auto sales in this and next quarter. Prospects for some-
what higher Federal defense expenditures also tend to support
expectations of acceleration of the expansion. All in all, there
does not appear to be sufficient new evidence to support any major
modification in the profile of our previous projections.
If this outlook proves correct, the economy will have ad-
justed to the massive shift in inventory investment from a peak rate of
accumulation in the fourth quarter to slight liquidation indicated
for the current quarter with only a minor interruption in economic
growth and with relatively mild adverse secondary effects on the
economy. By the third quarter the economic advance will have resumed
a pace which should halt, and probably reverse, current downward
pressures on industrial output and employment.
The drop in the rate of accumulation in the book value of
business inventories has been very steep--from a rate of $19 billion
in the fourth quarter to about $2 billion in March. With this
sharp drop in stock building, the inventory-sales ratio declined
slightly in March, reversing the sharp uptrend which had been under-
way since mid-1966.
The principal inventory problem remaining is in the area of
manufacturer's durable goods, where stocks for both defense and non-
defense categories are still high relative to sales. The nondurable

II -3
goods inventory-sales ratio fot madhiacturers in March, although
highet thad a year ago, was in line with that of March 1965 and below
that of March 1964. Stock-sales ratios for manufacturer's finished
durable goods were moderately higher than in March 1964 and 1965,
but the really large increase over the past year was in work in
process (much of which probably reflected long leadtime defense and
business equipment items). The durable goods inventory overhang thus
remains very large, foreshadowing further cuts in output in these lines.
Distributors' inventories were reduced in both February and
March, in large part because of reductions in auto stocks. Rising
auto sales in April and May cut the stock-sales ratio to a more
satisfactory level, and in view of recent better sales and the
possibility of a strike this fall, auto production should remain
relatively strong and any further buildup in stocks would likely be
intentional. The moderate increases in demand projected for non-
durable goods, along with reduced production levels, are expected
to result in further stock adjustments in this sector.
It seems likely, therefore, that total business inventories
will be liquidated, possibly at an annual rate of around $.5 billion,
in the second quarter in contrast to the $5.6 billion rate of accumu-
lation in the first quarter. In the third quarter, the retarding
influence of production cutbacks should be about over, and with some
final sales rising faster than output, some small further liquidation
is likely, perhaps at an annual rate of about $2 billion.

II -4
In real terms, the rise in disposable income in the first
quarter was larger than in any quarter of the past year. Although the
second quarter flow of income will be somewhat smaller, the increase
in spending power will still be substantial. Gains in total employ-
ment--although not in industrial employment--and wage rates are con-
tinuing, while the small increase in the personal tax-take in the
first half of this year is leaving an unusually high proportion of
income gains in consumer's hands. These high levels of real income
have been reflected in an exceptionally high and rising saving rate
over the last six montha, and consumers are therefore in a position to
step up spending. However, total retail sales are still sluggish,
and since extended periods of high rates of consumer savings have
occurred before, we are projecting only a moderate growth in consumer
expenditures in the second and third quarters, Spending for nondurable
goods is projected as increasing only at about the modest (revised)
first quarter rate; domestic auto sales, however, are projected to
rise to an $8 million annual rate in the third quarter, from a $7.6
million rate in the second quarter.
Although the outlook for consumer expenditures thus con-
tinues to have major elements of uncertainty, there is more widespread
agreement that defense expenditure will be significantly higher than the
January Budget estimate. For fiscal 1967, the defense Budget will be
exceeded by over $1.5 billion, with rates of expenditures for the
January-March quarter already nearly $2 billion over January expectations.

II -5
In the April-June quarter, the annual rate of defense spending may
be nearly $3-1/2 billion higher than projected in January. Current
guesses suggest 1968 fiscal year defense outlays of $5-6 billion over
the Budget. These levels are reflected in our projection, which now
shows a $3 billion rise in the second quarter and $2.5 billion in the
third quarter.
Expenditures for transfer payments and interest are also
outstripping Budget estimates, with the result that the Federal
deficit (NIA basis) will run at a rate in excess of around $10
billion annually in the first half of this calendar year, compared with
$2 billion in the second half of last year. The $8 billion increase
in the deficit provides a rough measure of the role of the Federal
government in sustaining activity in the first half year when total
GNP is expected to rise only $16 billion. After midyear, the deficit
is expected to continue to increase to very high levels, even if
revenues should rise more rapidly as the economy returns to a higher
rate of expansion.
The role of State and local governments must also be con-
sidered stimulative, even though they normally do not run large deficits
on current account. Continued large municipal flotations in the
capital market and rising State-local revenues suggest a continued rise
in public works and related services.
Residential construction appears to be regaining its momentum
slowly. The staff projections embody increases in these outlays in

II -5a
the second and third quarters, in line with the recent pattern of
housing starts. High bond yields so far do not appear to have curbed
the flow of savings to mortgage lending institutions--in fact the
supply of mortgage money at the moment remains somewhat in excess of
demand on current lending terms. Potential demand for new homes is
being strengthened by rising resales of existing structures, de-
creasing vacancies, and new family formation, but even vigorous
response on the part of the housing industry cannot greatly shorten
the lag between the low winter rate of starts and a more normal rate
of completions.
In the area of fixed business investment, the unfavorable
impact on capital expenditures of the gradual decline in manufacturing
capacity utilization rates to 86 per cent or lower, and the decline in
profits, should be counterbalanced to some extent by the expected
reinstatement of the investment tax credit. Expenditures for farm
equipment were a little stronger in the first quarter and spending
for plant construction a little higher than estimated earlier. Mean-
while, the Commerce Department reported the profits decline in the
first quarter at $4.5 billion. Selling prices of finished industrial
commodities have risen somewhat and may moderate the effect of rising
unit labor costs on margins. If labor costs continue to rise, profits
margin may dip further in the second and third quarters, but corporate
liquidity should rise. It seems likely that outlays for business fixed
investment will remain fairly constant in this and the next quarters.
The next Commerce-SEC quarterly survey of business intentions to invest
in plant and equipment, to become available in early June, should help
to clarify the picture.

Industrial production. In April, industrial production
declined one-half point, or 0.3 per cent, to 155.9 per cent of the
1957-59 average from 156.4 in March. The decline in the total index
was moderated by a further rise in output in the automotive industry
amounting to one-half point in the total index. Cutbacks in output
were widespread among other final products and materials.
Auto assemblies rose 10 per cent in April--to an annual rate
of 7.6 million units (equal to sales)--but remained 16 per cent below
a year earlier; in May and June, output is scheduled at about the April
rate. Production of television sets dropped 20 per cent in April, to a
level 30 per cent below last December's high, but despite the sharp
cutback in production since December, manufacturers' total stocks of TV
sets increased 40 per cent as color TV inventories rose three-fold,
according to confidential trade reports. Output of furniture continued
to decline in April while production of appliances apparently stabilized
at a level about 15 per cent below last October's peak. Manufacturers'
inventories of some appliances, however, have continued to rise in this
period. Among consumer nondurable goods, output of apparel was below
previous highs, but production of staples edged up further.
Output of equipment continued to decline, except aircraft and
defense equipment which rose further. In April, production of business
equipment was 3 per cent below the high reached at the end of 1966.
Output of most nondurable and durable materials, including iron and
steel, also declined.

II -9
The moderate decline in the total index and decreases in its
components in the four months since December have been in some respects
similar to developments in the early stages of the mild 1960-61 recession,
whereas in the first four months of the 1953-54 and 1957-58 recessions
declines were much more pronounced. In those earlier downturns, output
in most industries was generally reduced simultaneously. In the recent
period, however, production in some groups started to decline before
the end of 1966 and in some industries--autos, appliances, lumber, and
to a lesser extent steel--the readjustment in output appears to be about
over.

Retail sales. Retail sales in April were indicated to be
about unchanged from the revised March total, according to the Census
advance- estimate, and were not much changed from the level reached
1/last September. March sales, however, according to the preliminary-
estimate were revised sharply down from the level indicated previously
and were only 1.2 per cent above February sales, which have also been
lowered. The figures now indicate a rise in first quarter sales of only
.5 per cent from those in the final quarter of last year, in contrast to
a 1.7 per cent increase reported a month earlier. April sales at both
nondurable goods stores and durable goods outlets, as well as total
sales, were about 3 per cent above a year earlier.
Over the period since last September, total sales of durable
goods stores have declined nearly 3 per cent (with auto dealers off
about 7 per cent and other durables up 3 per cent) while nondurable
goods sales have increased 1 per cent. These changes have been about
offsetting and total retail sales have shown little change.
Auto markets. Domestic deliveries of new cars in the month
of April were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 7.6 million units,
5 per cent above the rate in the preceding month, but 4 per cent below
a year earlier. Trade papers reported that the April sales increase
represented a market strengthening and that the industry views second
quarter sales with considerable optimism.
1/ See Appendix A for explanation of these designations.

II -11
Daily average sales in the first 10 days of May rose more
than seasonally to a rate 9 per cent above a month ago and 17 per cent
above a year earlier. Taken literally, this implies that May has started
off with a much higher annual rate of sales than in April, but the figures
should not be taken as too suggestive of the entire month's results
because they were so strongly influenced by special sales contests. Thus
almost all of the increase was attributable to a very sharp increase in
GM sales which were influenced by sales incentive programs in the Pontiac
and Chevrolet Divisions. Ford daily average sales were virtually unchanged
from the corresponding period in the preceding month, and were 10 per
cent below last year. On the other hand, Chrysler daily average sales
were down slightly from early April but 8 per cent above a year ago.
Output of new cars in April reached 657,000 units, or an
annual rate of 7.6 million units, up 10 per cent from March, but 16 per
cent below the rate a year ago. On a seasonally adjusted basis, the
stock of new cars on April 30 was virtually unchanged from the end of
March level. At the April daily average sales rate, the unadjusted
inventory, at 1.43 million units, represented a 50 days' supply, down
substantially from the record levels reached early in the year. Trade
papers indicate the industry expects new cars stocks to reman at 50-55
days' supply through the end of June and then to decline sharply in
July and August during the model change.
Consumer credit. In recent months, sluggishness in spending
for autos and other durable goods has been translated into reduced
demands for consumer credit. By February, the instalment credit expansion

II -12
had dropped to the lowest rate in 5 years. Consumers stepped up their
borrowing a little in March and the expansion rate accelerated for the
first time since last November, but it is still too early to tell
whether this signals a turn-around in the instalment credit situation.
Perhaps the most important development in March was that auto credit
outstanding was once again increasing. In February, repayments on old
auto debt actually were larger than new extensions, and as a result auto
credit declined $40 million, the first decline since September 1961.

Reports presently available for April are too sketchy to
permit much more than a guess. However, with April new car sales up
further, and fairly good sales increases reported by apparel and depart-
ment stores, it is likely that the rate of consumer borrowing at least
kept pace with March.
There are some signs of further easing in consumer lending
standards, although the picture is mixed. The clearest evidence is
provided by reports on auto contracts written by sales finance companies.

II -13
These show that the proportion of new-car contracts written for 36 months
has begun to rise again, after flattening out and turning down a little
in 1966. The ratio has now moved up for 5 successive months, from
80.1 per cent in October to 82.8 per cent in March, on a seasonally
adjusted basis. There are also signs of some easing in downpayment
requirements on new-car contracts. Interest charges on consumer loans
continue to react sluggishly, as they typically do, to changes in the
general level of market rates of interest. Right now, consumer rates
appear to be holding firm. Meanwhile, there are reports that some banks
are easing their policies on loans to new customers and to borrowers
outside their immediate service area and are again actively promoting
instalment loans.
Business inventories. The rate of inventory accumulation by
manufacturing and trade concerns (combined) in March declined slightly
further from the sharply reduced February rate. Preliminary March data
show a book value increase of $165 million (an annual rate of $2 billion),
as compared with $190 million in February (an annual rate of $2.3 billion).
In both months, declines in trade inventories offset a substantial por-
tion of the continuing--but reduced--accumulation by manufacturers. The
first quarter book value increase now works out to an annual rate of
$5.6 billion--down over two-thirds from the extraordinary $18.8 billion
rate in the fourth quarter.
Inventory liquidation continued in the trade sector in March,
with the decline again mainly accounted for by a large decrease in auto

II -14
dealer stocks, and for the entire quarter, trade inventories declined
at an annual rate of $1.7 billion. In the fourth quarter, trade stocks
had increased at a rate of almost $7 billion.
Inventory accumulation by manufacturers dropped sharply in
February and March and for the first quarter was at an annual rate of
$7.2 billion versus $12 billion in the fourth.
Last year's high and rising rate of inventory accumulation--
culminating in the record fourth quarter burst--generally far outpaced
the rise in sales, particularly in the durable goods sector, and stock-
sales ratios, which had been tending downward in 1964 and 1965, rose
substantially over the year, as shown in the table below.

While the rate of business inventory accumulation slowed
drastically in the first quarter of 1967, sales albo slackened and the
over-all stock-sales ratio rose further between December and March,
reflecting primarily developments in durable goods manufacturing indus-
tries.
At trade concerns dealing in durable goods, which had
contributed significantly to the sharp run-up in the total business
stock-sales ratio in 1966, the ratio stabilized during the first quarter.
At auto dealers sharp output curtailments brought stocks down consider-
ably more than sales. For other durable goods, the stock-sales ratio
showed only a small further rise, although it appeared clearly excessive
in March and a substantial adjustment in their inventory position was in
order, either through a sales pickup or further output curtailments, or
both. A pickup in auto sales in April and early May further improved
dealers' inventory position in that area.
In durable goods manufacturing, stocks of defense products,
which had shown by far the largest rise and had accounted for 30 per
cent of the total inventory increase in 1966, took another sharp spurt
between December and March and accounted for 60 per cent of the total
increase over that period. The December to March rise was about in
line with the increase in sales and the stock-sales ratio showed only
a slight further rise. In machinery and equipment industries, the stock-
sales ratio also showed little further increase, but as a result of a
marked slowing of the rate of stock build-up to the accompaniment of
little further increase in sales. For other durable goods, inventory
positions continued to deteriorate despite a pronounced slowdown in
inventory accumulation, as sales dropped sharply.

II -16
Construction activity. New construction activity in April
apparently continued to fluctuate near the moderately improved February
rate, at a level 7 per cent below the high in the first quarter of 1966.
While a month-to-month increase of 1 per cent is indicated by confidential
projections now available to us for April, this was associated with a
1 per cent downward revision for March.
Residential construction expenditures, which, as expected,
were revised upward for March, continued to expand in April for the
fourth consecutive month. Private nonresidential construction activity,
however, has apparently dwindled in recent months, particularly in the
case of commercial construction, which along with industrial activity,
had shown unexpected strength last winter. Public construction expend-
itures, as projected, have tended higher.

Seasonally adjusted private housing starts in April edged
slightly above the revised (1 per cent downward) rate for March. While
the March rate was moderately below the average for the first quarter
as a whole, it exceeded earlier projections and suggested that builders
have already moved into position to meet the difficult test of at least
a normal spring seasonal rise.
Moreover, seasonally adjusted building permits also expanded
further in April and much more sharply than starts. All regions and
all types of residential structures shared in the advance, which tended
to be most pronounced for multifamily units and in the Northeast which
had declined in March.

Whether the unusually heavy pressures from other capital
market sectors will seriously inhibit recently reviving commitment
activity for residential construction still remains to be determined.

II -18
Even if commitments are inhibited, sufficient momentum already has now
been generated by builders to maintain the course of starts and related
expenditures through the third quarter, within the range of our earlier
moderately optimistic projections. Moreover, transactions in existing
homes, which were also a casualty of last year's developments and which
are an important factor in new home demands, have picked up considerably
in recent months. Also, with completions still extremely low, vacancy
rates on rental properties have moved down further and rates for home-
owner units remained below earlier peaks.
In the first quarter as a whole, rental vacancy rates were
the lowest since early 1959. Among regions, a build-up of potential
demand based on this factor alone, seems clearest in the North Central
states and the South, as shown in the table. In both regions, the rate
in early 1967 was the lowest since early 1958. In the West, the average
was still relatively high, reflecting, in part, lingering elements of
overbuilding from earlier years in some localities; and in the Northeast
states, where rates tend to be lowest, there was little change.

Labor market. The latest labor market figures reflect some
further easing in demands for manpower. Unemployment insurance claims
continued into May at levels ccnsiderably above last year, suggesting
further layoffs in the industrial sectors. Manufacturing employment
in April was down for the third successive month, and both transporta-
tion and construction suffered employment cuts. But the labor market
on the whole remained relatively strong, with the unemployment rate
in April edging up only one tenth to 3.7 per cent.

Nonfarm payroll employment rose 98,000 over the month, but
the increases occurred entirely in trade, government and private services--
sectors with strong growth trends. Manufacturing employment was cut
117,000 in April, and after three months of decline, was down 234,000
from its January peak, This was the sharpest dip in manufacturing
employment since the 1961 recession, although the April figure may
have been affected somewhat by the teamsters strike. In contrast to

II -20
the previous month, the cutbacks in April were concentrated almost
entirely in durable goods industries; employment reductions of 20,000
or more occurred in primary metals, electrical and transportation
equipment.
Although average weekly hours of all factory production
workers were up by one tenth to 40.5 hours in April, there were wide-
spread further reductions in the workweek of durable goods industries.
Primary and fabricated metals, machinery, and electrical equipment
industries all had their workweeks cut by at least four tenths of an
hour in April, and all were down an hour or more from January. The
only significant increase in hours among durable goods industries
was in transportation equipment, reflecting the moderate rebound in
auto production. In contrast to the further shortening of the
workweek in durable goods industries, hours in nondurable goods'
industries increased two tenths of an hour, with the largest gains in
apparel and tobacco.
Employment gains totaling 286,000 in trade, finance, services
and government more than offset declines in the industrial sectors.
Expansion in these non-industrial activities reflects a general
tendency for them to grow both in periods of expansion and contraction,
They have increased steadily as a proportion of total employment in
recent decades, and now provide so much built-in employment growth
that total nonfarm employment is unlikely to decline very much short
of a major economic contraction.

II -21
The large employment increase in trade (188,000) folloting
a decline in March, probably reflected little more than the difficulty
of making an accurate seasonal adjustment at this time of year because
of the shifting date of Easter. The net rise from January to April
is more in line with the longer term trend of growth of the industry.
Unemployment. Stability of the total unemployment rate at
current low levels in the face of three months of continued layoffs
in manufacturing and slower growth in other industrial sectors has
been an impressive aspect of the labor market scene. The unemployment
rate in April was 3.7 per cent, virtually unchanged from the level of
the past four months, and about the same as a year earlier. As
suggested above, part of the reason for stability is the continued
strong growth of employment in government and the private services;
in the past three months, these industries increased their employment
by over half a million, apparently absorbing some of the laid-off
industrial workers.
Another reason for the stability of overall unemployment,
however, is the fact that along with the decline in overall employ-
ment there has been a compensating decline in the labor force. With
an easing of employment demand, some workers left the labor force--
mainly adult women--while others put off their entrance, which has
reduced the pressure on unemployment temporarily. The normal growth
in the labor force from December to March would call for a rise of
about 350,000; actually, the labor force contracted during those months.
However, unemployment insurance claims, which are particularly
sensitive to industrial layoffs, have been rising relative to last year.

II- 22
The seasonally adjusted rate of State insured unemployment rose from
2.5 to 2.7 per cent over the month, and in April was half a point
above a year earlier. Weekly unemployment insurance claims continued
well above last year's levels; in the week ending May 6th, claims were
running 340,000, or 35 per cent, higher than the same week last year.
It is unlikely that the total unemployment rate could
continue for long its recent remarkable stability if industrial
employment declines persist. With modest additional growth of real
output likely in the second quarter, some increase in unemployment
may be anticipated. But if a more rapid expansion of output is generated
in the third quarter the increase in the unemployment rate should be
relatively small.
Hours and earnings in nonagricultural industries. A new
statistical series was released in April by the Bureau of Labor
Statistics which makes available monthly estimates of average weekly hours
and average hourly and weekly earnings for the private nonagricultural
economy. These new estimates, covering some 44 million production or
nonsupervisory workers--about two-thirds of all nonfarm employees--provide
a much more comprehensive measure of changes in hours and earnings than
has heretofore been available. The data are currently available only
back to 1964, and are not seasonally adjusted.
Weekly earnings have increased more in the nonmanufacturing
sector than in manufacturing in the past year. The workweek in private
nonagricultural establishments was down by six tenths over the year,
while in comparison, the workweek of production workers in the more

II -23
cyclically-sensitive manufacturing sector, at 40.2 hours (not
seasonally adjusted), was down by an hour; in addition, hourly
earnings have been rising faster in most nonmanufacturing industries.

Agricultural developments. Farmland prices advanced 2 per
cent further from November to March when they were 7 per cent above a
year earlier, according to preliminary USDA data. This year-to-year rise
compares with an increase of 8 per cent in the preceding year. Advances
during the past year ranged from 9 per cent in the Corn Belt to less than
5 Der cent in Mountain States and the West Coast.

The somewhat slower rate of increase in the national average
in the latest 4-month period was largely confined to the regions along
the Atlantic Seaboard and the West Coast, Values rose at a quickened
pace in the Corn Belt and the Southern Plains. In the other central
regions, values advanced at a fairly even pace throughout the year.

II -25
USDA analysts suggest that whatever dampening effect higher interest
rates and reduced availability of credit may have had on land prices
in the past year was offset at least in part, by increased incomes
received in calendar 1966, and expanded plantings planned for 1967
crops.
Net realized farm income in the year 1966 was 15 per cent
above a year earlier and nearly one-third higher than the 1960-64
average. On a perfarm basis the increase was even more impressive
with average net realized income of $5,024 up 19 per cent from a year
earlier. However, farm income was declining after the first quarter
of 1966.
Increases in incomes from a year earlier were centered in
livestock regions which benefited from a 12 per cent average rise in
prices received for livestock and products in 1966. The smallest
increases were in regions largely dependent on crops. Increases of
a fifth or more in realized net income per farm were reported in the
central and western regions in 1966. The eastern third of the nation
fared less well. The Appalachian and Southeast regions had increases
of 7 per cent and 4 per cent, respectively, reflecting their dependence
on cash sales of tobacco, peanuts, potatoes, sugarcane, which brought
about the same cash receipts as the year before. Cotton receipts were
down 45 per cent from 1965 but compensating government payments were
made.
Voluntary transfers of farmland are off slightly in most
regions except the Corn Belt and Lake states, preliminary data show.
Both Federal land bank and insurance company representatives attenting

II -26
the May 1 meeting of the National Agricultural Credit Committee in
Chicago reported relatively low demand for farm real estate loans.
This undoubtedly reflects resistance to high land values but it may
reflect resistance to high interest rates as well. The rate is now
6 per cent at Federal land banks and according to a weighted fourth
quarter 1966 average, 6.6 per cent at insurance companies* The Federal
land banks, the only lender to publish such data, report that new
money advanced in the first quarter this year is 17 per cent less than
a year earlier. Perhaps many prospective borrowers have been dis-
couraged by the very tight lending policies last year.
Non-real estate loans are larger than a year ago but the rate
of expansion may be tapering off, At the end of December 1966 member
banks had 10 per cent more credit outstanding to farmers than a year
earlier, the same rate of expansion as in the preceding year, and
operating loans of the Farmers Home Administration were unchanged from
a year earlier. Production Credit Association loans outstanding in
March were up 17 per cent from a year earlier, a margin unchanged since
November. First quarter cash advances of the PCA's were 7 per cent
above a year earlier.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL SITUATION
First Quarter Flow of Funds. Preliminary estimates of the
flow of funds for the first quarter indicate a sharp increase in the
rate of credit expansion. Total borrowing, at a $70 billion seasonally
adjusted annual rate, was $16 billion above the fourth quarter of 1966.
The bulk of this increase was in Federal borrowing, business security
issues, and state and local borrowing. Mortgage flows were up slightly
and consumer credit flows were little changed.
Commercial banks supplied directly about half of the total
credit flow, a high proportion by any historical standard and a sharp
change from late 1966 when they supplied less than a fifth. Banks
were a major source of funds to the Government and municipal securities
markets during the first quarter, with net purchases larger than the
total of net issues in the two markets combined. The large supply of
corporate bonds was absorbed partly by nonbank financial institutions,
but funds were also attracted into the market from nonfinancial investors.

Federal finance. The major influence on the fiscal and
financial position of the Federal Government was the widening NIA
deficit which is estimated at about $10 billion during the quarter,
$6 billion deeper than the fourth quarter. The Home Loan Bank
System provided a substantial offset to this deficit with funds received
from savings and loan associations both as deposits and as loan repayments.
The burden of financing the deficit nevertheless was primarily on the1967

credit markets, where government borrowing rose to a $10.6 billion rate,
about three quarters of it in direct U. S. securities. Sales of loan
participation certificates were at a $6.3 billion rate, about as high
as the second quarter of 1966 and mainly in FNMA and Export-Import Bank
issues. This was offset in part by the retirement of Home Loan Bank
debt at a $4.8 billion annual rate during the quarter.
Business borrowing in credit markets. The first-quarter rise
in private borrowing was concentrated in security markets and contrasted
with the leveling of plant and equipment outlays and the decrease in
inventory investment. In part, the security issues were a funding of
capital outlays of late 1966 that had been paid for to a large extent
out of cash assets and other sources. In the fourth quarter of 1966,
over $20 billion (annual rate) of business investment had been covered
by sources other than borrowing and capital consumption (Table II, line 4),
and to some extent there was a need to restore liquid assets after the
drains of that period. Corporate holdings of liquid assets appear to
have risen sharply during the first quarter, at a $10 billion annual rate.

The borrowing may also have been partly in anticipation of
second-quarter tax payments, however, The corporate profit tax
payment schedule was accelerated another notch in April this year,
with payments that at annual rates will be $20 billion higher than
accruals of taxes during the quarter. This compares with a $7 billion
rate of excess payment over accruals in the second quarter of last yaar.
The tax payment schedule is a predominant influence on first-half
corporate finance this year, and uncertainties are mainly about the
extent to which payments will come from borrowing as against liquid
assets.------ ---- -.L~-L.ll~n.. -~1~ -I i f LI- _- -.-.-^ --

Sources of credit supply. The pattern of credit supply
continued the trend toward easing that had begun in the fourth quarter.
Inflows both to savings institutions and to commercial-bank time deposits
rose to the extraordinary annual rate of $50 billion, $15 billion above
any previous quarter and $35 billion above the fourth quarter. About
$7 billion of the increase from the fourth quarter was to savings
institutions, but much of this flow was channeled to Federal Home Loan
Banks, and lending by these institutions in credit markets was only
$2.5 billion higher than the fourth quarter.

The rise in time-deposit flows to banks was reflected in
loans and investments, however, and brought bank credit up to 50 per
cent of total borrowing during the quarter, as .against 18 per cent in
the fourth quarter and an average of 36 per cent for the years 1961-65.
The rise in bank lending was predominantly in direct Treasury issues,
loan participation certificates, and municipals and was a major factor
in each of these markets. Thus, while State and local government
borrowing rose to exceptionally high levels during the quarter, bank
buying of municipals was up over twice as much (relative to the fourth
quarter) and left only minor amounts of the net new supply of
municipals to be distributed among other investors. The impact was
still greater in Treasuries, where banks bought over twice as much
as the net total issued to the public (after seasonal adjustment) and
left nonbank investors as net sellers of $14 billion of these
securities at annual rates.
In the corporate bond market, the high rate of offerings was
facilitated to some extent by demand from mutual savings banks and
insurance companies. The mutuals, with a $2 billion increase over
the fourth quarter in rate of deposit inflow, invested the entire
increment in bonds and maintained their mortgage flows at the rate
of the last half of 1966. Insurance companies had a smaller drain
from policy loans than in 1966 and an offsetting rise in flows into
corporate bonds, much of it in the form of takedowns on commitments.
Even with the institutional demand, new issues were high enough to
require investment by the household sector at over a $2 billion
annual rate, and the market was under pressure during the quarter.

The rise from the fourth quarter in household buying of corporates
was almost equal to the decline in their flow into municipals. Within
the household totals, this shift was less important than the $11 billion
drop in buying of Governments and the rise in savings-deposit flows from
a $17 billion rate in the fourth quarter to a $33 billion rate. Corpo-
rations also sold Governments and invested in time deposits, but in
addition they appear to have bought large amounts of commercial paper.
Net issues of commercial paper continued in the first quarter at the
very high rate of the fourth quarter after seasonal adjustment, although
the first-quarter borrowing was mainly by nonfinancial corporations
rather than finance companies. For both groups, however, it was an
important substitute for bank credit, and the funds were evidently
supplied largely by other corporations investing for liquidity purposes.

Bank deposits. Since late April, total deposits of membet
banks have shown almost no expansion, and current projections suggest
that a modest reduction in deposits is expected over the remaining
weeks of May. As indicated in the table showing average weekly changes
in the components of member bank deposits, the recent slower growth
is the result of a sharp contraction in Treasury balances, not
completely offset by a more rapid rate of growth of private deposits.

U. S. Gov't demand -937 +274
Time and savings +422 +378
The rather sharp decline in Treasury balances since late April
reflects factors influencing both receipts and payments. Scheduled tax
receipts in May will be considerably smaller than April and payments from
Treasury balances were expanded by the increased pace of Government
expenditures. Payments were also increased by the large official
purchases of intermediate-term Treasury issues, designed to reduce
dealer inventories during the recent refunding. As a result, Govern-
ment balances are expected to decline, on a seasonally adjusted monthly
average basis, by $2 billion this month following their sharp rise in
April.

III -9
Time and savings deposit.inflows at weekly reporting banks
have been well maintained since the tax date. However, as indicated
in the table below, essentially all of the expansion at weekly reporting
banks has occurred in deposits other than negotiable CD's. From mid-
December of 1966 to mid-February of 1967 outstanding CD's had risen
rapidly as banks took advantage of declining market yields to replace
their previous deposit losses. After mid-February, CD inflows slowed
to a pace below that in 1966, and over the April tax period sizable
CD run-offs occurred. Since then, banks in New York and elsewhere have
not replaced all of their April run-offs.

Since mid-Feburary, offering rates on negotiable CD's have
not been high enough to attract sizable inflows. Banks tended to pull
back from the CD market in part because large deposit inflows were avail-
able from other sources-'especially consumer interest-bearing deposits.
Indeed, the enlarged inflow of consumer deposits has led some banks to
take actions to moderate their inflows.

III -10
Since late April, there have been some indications that a few
banks may be attempting to attract more large CD funds. While other
short-term rates have declined, offering rates on CD's have edged up
12 to 25 basis points since the tax date. In addition, there have
been reports that a few banks--expecting heavier loan demands later
this year--are now seeking longer-term CD's by offering over one year
certificates at rates above posted levels, apparently as high as 4-3/4
to 4-7/8 per cent. It is too early to determine the success of these
banks in attracting longer-term money, or whether this tendency will
spread.
While the increase in posted rates on CD's and the decline
in yields on other short-term investment has somewhat reduced the yield
advantage of competing money market paper, yields on CD's is still
historically low relative to finance company and commercial paper. Offer-
ing rates are also still 20 to 25 basis points below secondary market
yields on CD's. CD yields appear favorable only relative to Treasury
bills, whose yields have been under particular downward pressure due in
large part to official purchases and tax bill run-offs.
Bank credit. One reason why banks may lose interest in
replacing recent CD attrition quickly is that tax-related and other
credit demands in coming weeks are not expected to be particularly
large. The fluctuating and higher level of total corporate tax payments
this year has been an important factor determining both the pattern and
relatively high level of loan demands at banks. But in both May and
in June, tax payments are expected to be smaller than in the same months

III -11
of 1966, and this month the level of payments is relatively modest.
These payment schedules suggest the prospect of--perhaps substantial--
easing of business loan demand. This view tends to be reinforced by
the continued high level of market financing by businesses, their
apparent build-up of liquid assets since late last year, and the
sharp reduced rate of inventory investment.
Since the tax date, business loan expansion has been small
at weekly reporting banks outside of New York, and at New York City
banks--for which we have one more week of data--such loans declined
contraseasonally. With security financing remaining large and tax
payments lower, some of the May loan repayments in New York apparently
reflected the use of capital market proceeds. We have been advised
that most of the $100 million decline in loans to the machinery industry
at New York City banks during the second week of May represented
repayment of bank debt by a single large firm out of the proceeds of
its recent large capital market issue.
While business loan expansion has been generally dominated by
the pattern of tax payments so far this year, three industrial categories
of loans have remained strong. Loans to machinery and "other fabricated
metals" manufacturers--industries which are heavily affected by defense
outlays--have risen more than seasonally, and loans to the chemical
industry have also increased sharply. On balance, so far this year,
most other industrial classifications have shown seasonal or less than
seasonal changes. Declines in retail trade borrowing since year-end
apparently has been dominated by the reduction of automobile dealer
inventories.

III -12
Most other loan categories have continued to show relative
weakness. Growth in real estate and consumer loans has apparently
remained modest since mid-April, and loans to finance companies--which
had increased in April for the first time since last fall--declined
somewhat after the tax date as finance companies shifted back to
cheaper financing in the commercial paper market.
Weekly reporting bank holdings of Treasury issues--mainly
bills--continued to decline after the tax date, as they had in early
April, due perhaps to some continued liquidation of securities under-
written in March as Treasury deposits declined, but probably more the
result of the sharp decline in bill yields that have reduced their
relative attractiveness. New York City banks also liquidated sizable
amounts of State and local tax warrants, but these declines reflect
the seasonal tax inflows of political subdivisions. Weekly reporting
banks outside of New York City continued to be relatively large buyers
of municipals--mainly short-term issues.
U.S. Government securities market. In the first half of May
yields on Treasury notes and bonds rose further while Treasury bill
rates continued to decline. Thus, the spread between short- and long-
term yields continued to widen, with bill rates moving to new 1967 lows
and Treasury bond yields reaching new 1967 highs.

The further weakness in longer-term Treasury bonds since early
May has reflected continued concern over the size of new issue flotations
in capital markets, increasing investor awareness of the prospects for
large Treasury financing needs in the second half of 1967, and wide-
spread expectations of more vigorous economic expansion later this year.
Most recently, Treasury proposals before the House Ways and Means
Committee to modify the 4 1/4 per cent interest rate ceiling and permit
some borrowing through longer-term issues at higher yields served to
half a minor rally which developed late last week.
Issues in the 5-year maturity area performed somewhat better
than longer-term bonds in the first half of May, reflecting in part
sizable Treasury trust fund purchases in the 1971-74 maturity range.
These purchases helped to absorb loosely-held blocks of securities that
had been weighing on the market during the period of the Treasury
refunding.

III -14
Preliminary results of the refunding indicate public
subscriptions of $2.0 billion for the new 15-month note and $247
billion for the new 5-year note. Attrition from holders of securities
maturing in May and June was somehwat larger than anticipated and
totaled $0.8 billion or around 18.5 per cent, but private holders
of $1.3 billion of issues maturing in August exercised their option
to exchange into the new 5-year note, a better turn-in than had been
generally expected.
Treasury bill rates continued to decline in the first half
of May, as bills remained in generally strong demand from a wide range
of investors, including the Federal Home Loan Banks. Some funds from
sellers of rights in the May refunding and from holders of maturing
securities redeemed at mid-month may also have been re-invested in
Treasury bills.
Short-term rates on market instruments other than bills
showed mixed changes in the first part of May, after declining earlier.
While rates on commercial and finance company paper and on bankers'
acceptances fell, rates on CD's edged up, especially on the longest
maturities.

Treasury finance. Treasury borrowing needs are expected to
be very large over the second half of 1967, as a large budgetary deficit
is projected to augment the usual seasonal cash drain. Although
estimates at this point must be highly tentative, our current "best
guess" points to overall borrowing needs on the order of $18 billion
for the July-December period (Table A line 2) and this figure does not
allow for an additional $2.5 billion in participation certificate
sales implied by the Budget message.

III -16
Major assumptions underlying these projections include
continued expansion in defense expenditures, legislation raising
social security benefits (retroactive to July 1), and no surtax legis-
lation effective in calendar 1967.- For the present, we are assuming
that the Federal Home Loan Banks will not be significant net borrowers
in the second half of 1967. It might be noted that Treasury borrowing
needs in the second half are higher than otherwise, because the
Treasury is not expected to have a large end-of-June cash balance on
which to draw as in other recent years. This will also mean that the
Treasury must come to the market for cash relatively early in the
second half. Table A compares borrowing needs projected for the second
half with those of comparable periods in other recent years.
I/ The second half projection carries defense expenditures at an annual
rate that would be about $5 billion above the January 1967 Budget
message figure for fiscal 1968. The projection also assumes in-
creased social security benefits at an annual rate of $2 billion,
which is about half the amount recommended by the President. If a
surtax of 6 per cent is passed, effective October 1, it should
reduce the second half cash deficit by around $1 billion.

Corporate and municipal bond markets. Yields on new corporate
and municipal bonds rose again last week to new highs for the year. At
these more liberal yield levels, some signs of expanded investor demand
appeared. But most recently, Treasury's request for statutory leeway
to sell longer-term Treasury debt has created new market uncertainties.
With the immediate calendar of new issuesstill heavy, the likely near-
term course of long-term rates thus remains in doubt.
Precise quantification of the extent of the yield advance since
the early weeks of April is difficult because the available yield series
on new and recently offered bonds have lacked homogeneity. But last
week's new Aa-rated electric utility issue with five-year call protection
carried a yield of 5.78 per cent, 40 basis points above that on a similar
issue offered at the end of March, Over the same period, yields on
seasoned municipal bonds have advanced as much as 34 basis points.

The sharpness of the yield advance since early April has of
course, reflected the general strengthening of market convictions about
the course of economic activity in the second half. But the most immediate
and pressing cause of recent yield increases has been the continued and
mounting pressure of new issue volume. In addition to the heavy supply of
corporate and municipal bonds expected through June, a large Federal
participation certificate offering (of as much as $900 million), and a
number of foreign bonds will add to aggregate security volume in markets
for public offerings. Altogether, and in the absence of postponements,
the June volume of public financings may amount to as much as $3.8 billion,
about the same as in March.
In the corporate bond market, the estimated volume of public
offerings for May has swelled nearly to the $1.4 billion total marketed
in April, and in June volume may exceed $1.4 billion. While June always
shows a seasonal increase in corporate public offerings, this year's
estimated total could exceed last year's by $600 million. This would
make aggregate public offerings for the second quarter total a little
over $4 billion--$800 million larger than in the first quarter and more
than twice the second quarter volume last year. Prior to the Secretary
of Treasury's debt statement, corporate utility companies had already
postponed scheduled issues totaling about $150 million, and since then two
negotiated industrial offerings have been deferred temporarily, However,
these latter issues are expected back in the market shortly, and other
industrial corporations also have indicated tentative plans for large
debt issues. Thus, any lifting of yield pressures as a result of post-
ponements could encourage new additions to the corporate calendar

Among other things, the record volume of corporate borrowing
in the public market this year has reflected the substitution of publicly-
offered bonds for other forms of borrowing. In addition to the
substitution of market borrowing for expansion of bank debt, growth
of public offerings has occurred partly because of a shrinkage
in the volume of private placements--due chiefly to the constraints
exerted by tight money on the advance commitment activity of life
insurance companies in 1966.
Data just released by the SEC indicate that corporate private
placements in the first quarter this year dropped $750 million or 30
per cent behind private placement volume in the like period of 1966. As
a result, first quarter private placements accounted for only 41
per cent of total corporate borrowing this year, whereas they had
amounted to nearly 60 per cent of the total in the like period of 1966,- --- --
--

III -22
Manufacturing corporations--the major users of private place-
ments--have accounted for much of this year's increase in public bond
offerings. From the end of December through April, roughly three-fifths
of all public bond offerings were made by such corporations, one-fifth
more than in the like period of 1966. Public utility financing, although
considerably larger than a year ago in absolute dollar volume continued
to amount to about one-fifth of the total, while financing attributable
to financial corporations, dropped sharply, both absolutely and relatively.
Most recently, financing by both industrial corporations and public
utilities has continued heavy, but offerings by financial corporations
have also expanded.
In the municipal bond market estimate of May,offerings have
been revised upward to more than $1 billion, following the scheduling
of several large new issues. And the number or large offerings already
scheduled for June suggests that the total may exceed $1 billion in that
month as well. A special influence currently adding to pressures on
municipal yields in the fact that volume in the weeks immediately ahead
includes an unusually large proportion of long-term maturities, the part
of the term structure that has attracted the least investor interest in
recent weeks.
While the blue list of dealers' advertised inventories has
dropped about $150 million since late April, the total overhang of unsold
issues held by market professionals is estimated to be substantially larger
than the advertised figure. One small municipality scheduled to borrow
last week announced that it was postponing long-term financing and would

III -23
finance its interim needs with short-term loans. This action had little
effect on the volume of expected long-term financing, but it may presage
other postponements if the present market congestion continues.

Mortgape market revelopments. With credit demands in
capital markets strong, the decline in yields on home mortgages
slowed in April, despite the large continuing net inflows of
savings to nonbank thrift institutions. In fact, during the first
two weeks of May, there were scattered reports of a slight rise in
yields on Federally-underwritten home loans in a number of Eastern
cities, adding to uncertainty about future mortgage market conditions.
The change apparently surprised some mortgage companies that had been
warehousing uncommitted FHA and VA loans in the belief that the recent
improvement in prices paid for these mortgages by savings banks and
life insurance companies would continue for some time longer. Official
data are not yet available to assess how much the tone of the market
has changed or how widespread the change may have been.
The over-all decline in yields on new-home mortgages from
the turning point last November to April amounted to 30 basis points
in the conventional series and to 52 basis points in the FHA series.
Despite these unusually large reductions, April yields on conven-
tional loans were still 60 basis points above the yield plateau which
prevailed from the spring of 1963 through the summer of 1965. Yields
on FHA loans, which have been more volatile, were still about 85 basis
points above their 1963-65 low.

Continued underlying strength in the availability of mortgage
credit during April is suggested by the reduced volume of mortgages
offered to FNMA for purchase under its secondary market operations as
well as by scattered FNMA mortgage sales. But with yields on corporate
bonds tending upward while those on home mortgages were declining,
yield spreads in favor of home mortgages narrowed sharply after February.
By April, the spread had declined nearly to the unusually narrow
margins that prevailed during much of 1966.
Flows to financial intermediaries. Preliminary estimates
indicate that all three depositary-type financial intermediaries con-
tinued to receive savings in record volume during April.

III -26
As the table shows, aggregate April flows are estimated to
have been nearly three times the previous April high reached in 1964,
(the first year for which separate data on large CD's are available).
On a seasonally adjusted annual rate basis, the 17 per cent April
increase for S&L's and the 19 per cent increase for savings banks were
the highest growth rates reached since savings flows began improving
last year.

While data are not yet available on the uses to which April
flows were put, industry observers report that neither S&L's nor savings

inflows of this magnitude. Savings banks are apparently continuing to
place an unusually large share of their funds in corporate bonds And
S&L's are continuing to reduce their indebtedness at the Home Loan
Banks and to a lesser extent to build up holdings of liquid assets.
At both types of institutions, however, the allocation of funds was
apparently dictated in large part by the continuing relative scarcity
of immediately available mortgages.
During the first quarter, S&L repayments to the Home Loan
Banks, while consistent in direction with the normal seasonal pattern
were unusually large. The $450 million of further repayments since
March, however, is distinctly contra-seasonal and compares with net
increases in April borrowing of $829 million in 1966 and $472 million
in 1965. Over the longer period since last August, S&L's have repaid
$2.6 billion of their outstanding advances. As a result, their total
indebtedness to the Home Loan Banks has dropped to the lowest level in
two years.
While both savings banks and S&L's have rebuilt liquidity
ratios (cash and governments to savings) from last year's low points,
these increases have net been as sharp as the recovery in savings
flows. S&L's, by reducing their relatively expensive Home Loan Bank
debt, are now in a position to borrow heavily again, if this should
become necessary. Savings banks, on the other hand, in purchasing
record amounts of corporate bonds have not sacrificed significantly
on their earning potential (once allowance is made for servicing costs
on mortgages), and at the same time they have acquired assets with
more potential marketability than mortgages.

Stock market. After reaching new high levels early in
May, stock prices declined moderately on balance through May 16. The
decline--which amounted to about 1-1/2 per cent in Standard and Poor's
composite index--was partly a reaction to the sustained rise from
mid-April to early May. But it also apparently reflected some
weakening in investor optimism regarding business and profit prospects
later this year and in 1968.
Trading volume remained high--during both the period of
price advances and the subsequent period of decline. In the first two
weeks of May, daily volume averaged about 10.7 million shares--well
above the 9.4 million share average for all of April.
Based on seasonally adjusted fourth quarter 1966 earnings,
the price-earnings ratio for Standard and Poor's composite index at
the early May high was 17.2, compared with 13.0 in October 1966.
However, the early May ratio was below the 17.9 level of February 1966--
the previous high for stock prices--and well below the 20-22 range
which prevailed in 1961. Since mid-April, dividend yields have
fallen further to 3.14 per cent, and the spread in favor of newly
issued corporate bonds has widened by an additional 15 basis points.
In April, net debit balances, as measured by the New York
Stock Exchange's margin panel series, increased by $60 million. This
rise follows the revised increase in March of $90 million and a
February increase of $120 million. The smaller increase in April
apparently reflected some customer withdrawals of funds to pay personal
income taxes. Purpose loans at banks, which increased by about $60
million in April, were back to levels which prevailed in early October 1966.

U.S. balance of payments. The payments deficit in the first
quarter on the liquidity basis was $540 million, seasonally adjusted,
after reduction by about $500 million of special transactions. The
"flash" report for April -- based on reports from a sample of 40 large
banks -- shows an unadjusted deficit on the liquidity basis of $350
million. Apparently there were no sizable special transaction receipts
during the month. In past years, April has accounted for much more
than one-third of deficits in the second quarter, so that substantial
downward seasonal adjustments of April deficits were appropriate. This
year, with oil company payments to Libya shifted from April to March,
this may no longer be the case. It therefore appears that the April
result represents, broadly speaking, a continuation of the past two
quarters' large underlying liquidity deficits, not counting special
transactions, which have run about $1 billion per quarter.
Data presently available show that there was a substantial
improvement ($300 million) in the merchandise trade balance between
the fourth and first quarters and (based on new seasonal adjustments)
no change in the rate of reduction in claims reported by U.S. banks.
The trade improvement was more than offset by an increase ($200 mil-
lion) in outflows of U.S. private capital into foreign securities and
by the absence of debt prepayments receipts, which had amounted to
about $200 million in the fourth quarter. The balance on all other
transactions that affect the liquidity deficit was about unchanged.
Within that residual, military expenditures in Asia probably continued

IV -2
to increase. It is not yet known whether outflows of direct investment
capital and net unrecorded payments continued unudually large, as in the
fourth quarter, nor are data yet available on investment income, other
services, or Government grants and loans.
Additional information regarding the large first-quarter
improvement in the merchandise trade balance is sketchy. The balance
of automotive trade with Canada appears to have been somewhat less
favorable than in the fourth quarter. Total imports, at an annual rate
of $26.8 billion, were essentially unchanged from the fourth quarter.
Imports of foods, notably sugar and cocoa, increased, while imports of
materials such as lumber and wool declined. On the export side, the
unusually sharp increase of about 7 per cent in nonagricultural exports,
while agricultural exports declined, included large shipments of many
types of machinery and aircraft.
The net outflow on new security issues in the first quarter --
mainly to Canada -- was higher than indicated earlier; at $350 million,
seasonally adjusted, it was substantially above the depressed level of
the fourth quarter. Well over half of the issues sold in the first
quarter were offered in January and the beginning of February, al-
though not all were taken down then. Offerings of foreign issues
subsequently have been in much reduced volume, apart from the $250
million IBRD issue in March, of which $90 million was paid for in
April. The firming of long-term rates in this country since February,
together with the availability of funds in the Euro-dollar bond market,
reduces the incentives for foreigners -- especially others than

IV -3
Canadian borrowers and international organizations -- to sell issues
in the U.S. market. The narrow margin that presently obtains between
U.S. and Euro-dollar bond rates is illustrated by two issues by the
Government of Mexico: an April offering in the U.S. (not subject to
IET) was quoted in early May to yield 7.3 per cent; a Mexican Euro-
bond issue has been scheduled to be offered at a yield of about 7.5
per cent.
In the first quarter there was a net reduction of $65 million
in claims on foreigns reported by banks in the United States, following
a similar reflow in the fourth quarter (based on revised seasonal
adjustments.) The first-quarter reflow reflected continued large net
repayments on long-term loans; there were also net repayments of short-
term bank loans and acceptance credits, but these were more than offset
by increased collection claims on foreigners. The total reflow of
bank loans plus acceptances, before seasonal adjustment, was close to
the $215 million reflow reported for the quarter under the VFCR.
Within the first quarter, there were net reflows of bank
credits in January and February and net outflows in March. The March
outflows consisted mainly of net extensions of credits to Japan and
Latin America, which offset earlier reflows from these countries.
Most of the net reflow for the quarter represented reductions in
outstanding credits (long- and short-term) to Europe.
Reports by banks and non-banks (still incomplete for the
quarter) reveal no significant movements of liquid funds in the first
quarter. There was a small increase in sterling assets, and a rise

IV -4
in dollar deposits abroad that may have been associated with temporary
investment of proceeds of external bond issues by domestic affiliates
of U.S. companies making direct investments abroad.
On the basis of official reserve transactions, the U.S.
payments deficit in the first quarter was $1.3 billion before seasonal
adjustment and $1.8 billion after adjustment. Preliminary indicators
show that large deficits have continued in April and early May. For
the 6 weeks March 30 -May 10 (which overlaps the first quarter by two
days) the unadjusted deficit totaled $1.1 billion; during this most
recent period U.S. banks reduced their liabilities to foreign branches
by $620 million, and this decline appearsto account for the difference
between the balance on the liquidity basis and on official settlements,
as shown by the weekly indicators. (By contrast, the $1 billion differ-
ence between these two measures of the balance in the first quarter
greatly exceeded the reduction in liabilities to branches, primarily
because special transactions which benefited the liquidity balance did
not equally affect the balance on the basis of official reserve trans-
actions.)

IV -5
Industrial production abroad. Over-all industrial activity
in Europe was virtually level during the last quarter of 1966 and the
first two months of this year, and slightly below the plateau of the
two preceding quarters. This interruption of growth was due mainly
to policy actions the two largest countries took to curb excess demand.
British industrial production declined from last summer through November,
and German output from last summer through February. The weakness of
German demand in particular exerted a depressing or restraining in-
fluence on the economies of neighboring countries, including not only
such smaller countries as the Netherlands, Belgium, and Austria, but
also France, where industrial activity was virtually unchanged from
July 1966 through February of this year. In Italy output rose strongly,
but less rapidly after midyear than before.
Major restraining roles were played in Britain in 1966 by a
wage freeze, instalment credit controls, new taxes, and general mone-
tary measures -- with marked effects in reducing consumer expenditures
and inventory investment in the latter part of last year. In Germany,
tight monetary conditions until late in the year hit State and local
governments particularly hard, and consumer outlays for goods also
fell off in the fourth quarter. Easing of monetary policies in both
countries this year has removed one block to recovery, while expan-
sion of government expenditures -- together, perhaps, with autonomous
strengthening of consumer demand -- seems to be providing the chief
immediate stimulus. Business fixed capital expenditure plans in both
countries remain weak.

German industrial production was unchanged from February to
March (OECD seasonal adjustment) at a level 7 per cent below the high
plateau of March-June 1966. After falling rapidly since October, out-
put of "capital goods" (including autos, TV's, and other eleectrical
goods) declined only a little further in March, and output of consumer
nondurables (excluding food) moved up slightly. These developments
followed a pickup in February of manufacturers' new orders. We will
need at least another month's production data to judge whether a turning

IV -7
point was being reached in German industrial activity. New orders
in March rose slightly further according to the Bindesbank's seasonal
adjustment, but the OECD adjustment (not yet available)may show a new
dip.
Through most of 1966 new orders for both durables and non-
durables were falling faster than current deliveries, and consequently
there were large reductions in outstanding unfilled orders. The level-
ing out of new orders in the early months of 1966 may have been related
to the improvement registered in retail sales: after dropping by 10
per cent from September to December, retail sales picked up sharply,
and in the first quarter were again at their third-quarter-of-1966 level
(OECD seasonal adjustment). As there was very little change in average
retail prices, a corresponding recovery occurred in the real volume of
retail trade.
In contrast to the developments described above, industrial
output of materials (including chemicals, steel, and building materials,
but excluding intermediate products of the textile industry which are
classed with consumer nondurables) has been relatively stable in total
over the past year. Excess order books for steel built up in 1963 and
1964 were largely run off in 1965. Apparently of late there has been
no large overhang of materials inventories to work off -- apart from
chronic trouble with coal.
Despite these signs suggesting a possible bottoming out of
the German recession, business confidence has continued at a low ebb.
This is understandable in view of the emergence of a considerable margin

IV -8
of unused capacity and of the further rise in unemployment, which
reached a new high of 2.2 per cent of the labor force at the end of
March, over three times its level a year earlier. Moreover, though
exports in the first quarter were at a very high level, new export
orders in February and March averaged no higher than in the preceding
three months November-January. Thus foreign demand, the principal
support for German economic activity during most of 1966, could no longer
be counted on for immediate stimulus.
In mid-April the Parliament's Budget Committee approved re-
lease of the final one-third tranche of the DM 2.5 billion contingency
budget. The Bundesbank (as previously reported) announced on April 27
a reduction in reserve requirements effective May 1. On May 11 the
discount rate was lowered for the fourth time this year and is now
3 per cent, as low as during cyclical troughs in 1954 and 1961.
In Britain industrial production has shown signs of recovery
since the sharp drop of last summer and fall. From the 1966 high in
July-August output had fallen steadily to November, dropping 4 per cent.
Manufacturing production had declined 6 per cent. In December and
January, manufacturing output moved up more than 2 per cent, and the
January level was maintained in February.
The cyclical movement was most marked in the textile, leather,
and apparel sector and in metals. In these two sectors recovery con-
tinued in February. Output of textiles, leather, and apparel had fallen
10 per cent from March 1966 to December, and then regained two-fifths
of the lost ground in the next two months. Metals production had been

IV -9
declining from quarter to quarter since the spring of 1965, and fell
off most rapidly toward the end of 1966; the fourth-quarter average
was down 12 per cent from the second quarter of 1965. Monthly, out-
put of metals was lowest in November, and it rose in each of the next
three months.
In the important "engineering and allied industries" (machinery
and equipment, including vehicles) the fourth-quarter level of production,
which was 3 per cent lower than in the first quarter of 1966, was main-
tained in January and February. Partial recovery in automobile production
offset declines for capital equipment.
Construction activity in the last quarter of 1966 stayed at
the high level reached in the third quarter. However, the value of new
construction orders fell considerably; for both residential and non-
residential construction, orders were one-tenth lower in the fourth quarter
than in the second.
As we noted three weeks ago, stimulus to expansion in Britain
is being provided by a rising trend in publis investment expenditures --
mainly those of nationalized industries and local authorities -- and no
further reflationary measures were taken in the April Budget. On May 4,
Bank rate was reduced to 5-1/2 per cent; this was the third reduction
this year.
British imports rose in April, apparently confirming the pick-
up in domestic demand, but the increase was far sharper than had been
expected. Though exports also rose, regaining their February-March aver-
age level, the trade balance worsened.

IV -10
In France industrial production was unchanged in January
and declined one point in February. The February INSEE survey in-
dicates continuing cautiousness on the part of businessmen, reflect-
ing weakness in domestic consumer demand and the unsatisfactory export
situation.
The government still expects real GNP to rise by 4.7 per
cent in 1967 over 1966, but French business opinion appears more nearly
in line with the OECD staff estimate of a 4 per cent gain. Both estimates
assume an upturn in German demand before long.
Italy was the only major European country where economic
activity was still rising vigorously when the year came to a close.
For the full year 1966, industrial production was 11.4 per cent higher
than in 1965, while the rise in real GNP was 5.5 per cent. The OECD
staff looks for continuation of this rate of GNP growth in 1967, but
with a somewhat less rapid rise in industrial production.
The generally rising trend of Italian exports was interrupted
last summer by the fall in German demand, but has since resumed. There
may also have been some moderation of inventory investment in the second
half of 1966, especially for cars and trucks. But such restraining in-
fluences have been outweighed by rising domestic consumption and fixed
investment.
The decline in Italian residential construction that started
in 1964 has been reversed. Housing starts rose, and the decline in
completions appeared to be leveling out as the year progressed.
In the Netherlands, industrial production continued to rise
through February (OECD seasonal adjustment), but order backlogs have

IV -11
been declining and demand pressures have diminished enough to have
led the central bank in February to moderate its restraints on credit
expansion.
Belgian industrial output, after remaining generally stable
through most of 1966, stepped up in December-February, apparently re-
flecting increased output of consumer nondurables such as textiles and
of materials. Output of capital equipment was unchanged. The pro-
duction increase was accompanied by a rise in exports, and both may
have been related to the removal of the British import surcharge. That
is known to have been a factor in the temporary bulge in Austrian in-
dustrial production in December and Austrian exports in December and
January.
In Sweden, where fiscal policy has been directed toward reduc-
ing the pressures of domestic demand on resources, industrial production
declined after last September to a low in January. Output rose in
February. From the fourth quarter of 1966 to the first quarter of this
year production in consumer goods industries increased, but there were
declines for metal products, wood products, and iron mining.
Canadian industrial production, after an earlier dip, moved
up from July to November last year. In the next three months it changed
little, dipping slightly in January and rising in February (latest).
Fixed investment was fairly stable in real terms throughout 1966. De-
spite some reduction in the rate of inventory investment, manufacturers'
stock-sales ratios remained higher after mid-1966 than they had been for
some time past.

IV -12
The first significant interruption to the rise in Japanese
industrial production since late 1965 occurred in February, followed,
however, by a rise to a new high in March. Some fall-off in the months
February and March taken together is evident in output of consumer
goods, both durable and nondurable; this may be related in part to the
leveling off in Japanese exports since late last year. Output of capital
goods has continued to advance.

APPENDIX A: RECENT CHANGES IN RETAIL SALES ESTIMATES*_
The recent revision in the retail sales estimate for the month
of March has raised questions concerning the reporting sequence and in-
terpretation of the Census Bureau's retail sales series. For any given
month, a succession of estimates of the level and change in retail sales
becomes available over a period of several months, beginning with the
weekly retail sales figures (not adjusted for seasonal variation) which
are based on sample data collected from 2,500 firms covering approximately
48,000 retail stores. The weekly figures are released on Thursday after-
noon of the following week, and as the month progresses the weekly figures
provide some basis for a very rough estimate for the month as a whole.
The first actual seasonally adjusted monthly estimate, however,
is the Census Bureau's "advance" estimate which -i published about 10 days
following the close of the month. This is based on monthly information
collected from the same subsample that reports weekly sales, A month
later a "preliminary" estimate of monthly retail sales becomes available
which is based on the Census Bureau's full reporting sample of retail
stores, a sample about three times greater than the weekly sample. This
preliminary estimate is then subject to further revision (usually mod-
erate)--and becomes the "final" estimate--about two months after the
"advance" estimate is released.
The advance estimate of retail sales in March, released on
April 10, optimistically specified a strong 3.2 per cent increase above
February. This estimate led many to conclude immediately that a moderate
to strong revival of consumer demand was underway. Probably, the concen-
sus of informed opinion was that the advance estimate properly signaled
a spring upturn. Retail sales had remained virtually unchanged over the
preceding six months while personal income. had risen sharply further,
making for a strong presumption that sales would turn up soon. However,
final retail sales have rarely increased so sharply in any one month,
except in months in which sales were strongly affected by exogenous
economic circumstances such as a nationwide strike.
Once preliminary returns from the full reporting panel were
completed, a downward revision was required in sales for March. The
preliminary March estimate released on May 10, revised downward by about
$0.7 billion (or nearly 3 per cent) the advance March estimate of a month
earlier, understandably dampening the previous optimistic view that a
spring sales revival was underway. Based on the more complete data,
March retail sales at $25,771 million, seasonally adjusted, were 1.2 per
cent above February (which in the meantime had been revised downward),
and 1 per cent above a year earlier.
