SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK
Outlook for economic activity
Most currently available indicators suggest that the expected
upturn in economic activity is now under way. New orders for durable
goods, industrial production, nonfarm employment, and the factory work-
week have all moved up in varying degrees; retail sales figures for
June have been revised upward, and unemployment is apparently drifting
down after the moderate uptrend of recent months. In the third quarter,
GNP should show a relatively large rise, with real growth expected to
reach an annual rate of around 4 per cent. Supported by rising govern-
ment expenditures, and by a shift from inventory liquidation to some
accumulation of stocks, the fourth quarter is likely to show a further
rise in the rate of real growth in total GNP, even though our estimates
assume the proposed tax increase on individual incomes becomes- effec-
tive October 1.
A continued uptrend in new orders for durable goods and the
July turnaround in the production index suggest that cutbacks in output
to adjust excessive inventories may be largely completed. In June,
there was a sizable liquidation of business inventories--with stocks
reduced in both manufacturing and at distributors--and the over-all
stock-sales ratio declined. Further liquidation may take place in the
third quarter as producers continue to seek a better balance with sales;
by the fourth quarter, however, output and employment are expected to
be expanding more rapidly and some inventory rebuilding should be under-
way.

I-2
Recent sharper gains in personal income, reflecting
rising employment and earnings, are now providing strong support for
consumer expenditures. In coming months, the pace of hiring in manu-
facturing and other industrial activities is expected to pick up, and
large wage increases are likely to become more widespread. Neverthe-
less, the upward trend in consumption expenditures would be expected
to slow markedly in the fourth quarter if withholding taxes are raised
on October 1.
The outlook for business fixed investment also seems to be
improving. New orders for machinery and equipment have increased
steadily in recent months, backlogs have expanded, and in July,output
and employment in the machinery industries turned up. These develop-
ments appear related in part to the reinstitution of the investment tax
credit and are consistent with our expectation of a modest rise in
business outlays in the last half of this year.
Outlook for resource use and prices
With industrial production estimated to be up in July and
prospects for further gains in coming months, the protracted decline
in manufacturing capacity utilization--from a 91 per cent rate last
August to 84 per cent in June--may now be about over. At current rates
of operation, pressures on capacity persist in only a few lines--notably
aircraft and electrical generating equipment. In most industries, more-
over, capacity is continuing to expand at a rapid pace despite the
decline in utilization rates since last autumn. Thus, there is ample

I-3
room for expansion in output, and the rise in production now anticipated
for the remainder of the year is likely to result in only moderately
higher rates of utilization.
For manpower, too, resources appear adequate. Employment is
expected to continue to expand substantially along with growth in
aggregate demands for civilian and military purposes. But the labor
force also is expected to grow rapidly, and the unemployment rate is
likely to decline only moderately below the relatively low 4 per cent
level.
Excess capacity and labor resources contributed to industrial
price stability from February to June, but prices appear to be rising
now. A fairly large number of relatively moderate price increases
recently has been announced, although through mid-July BLS has estimated
only a slight rise in the over-all index of industrial prices. Unit
labor costs in manufacturing are up substantially, and although rising
output should contribute to increased productivity, the recent pattern
of wage settlements suggests continued pressures on costs.
The upward spurt in wholesale prices of farm products in
May and June precipitated a sharp rise in retail food prices and an
acceleration of the rise in the consumer price index. Retail food
prices may continue to rise, even if the increase at wholesale slows.
Earlier retail prices of non-food commodities were rising appreciably
and prospects are for continuing advances. Altogether, the consumer
price index is likely to continue to advance at a faster pace than last
winter--when food prices were declining--but not so rapidly as the May-
June average.

I -4
Capital markets outlook
The psychological atmosphere in capital markets improved
only to a minor extent as a result of the President's recent tax
message. Doubts about the timing and size of a tax increase prevailed,
and it became apparent that the projected budgetary deficit would be
very large even with a tax increase. Nevertheless, distribution of
recent large corporate offerings was somewhat encouraged by the tax
message, and yields on such high-grade bond issues have leveled off
somewhat below their late June highs. Yields on new and seasonal
municipal bonds have continued to decline from their recent peak.
Offerings of new corporate and municipal issues are expected
to remain large in the weeks ahead, especially in the corporate market,
although abating somewhat from recent levels. Such offerings may not
generate any further upward interest rate pressures--they could even
be accompanied by some tendency for long-term rates to edge lower--
provided that prospects for a tax increase do not begin to appear more
remote.
Perhaps the principal force that might offset a tendency for
intermediate- and long-term rates to stabilize or drift down in the
period ahead--apart from the appearance of good economic news--would be
the Treasury cash financing of about $2.5 billion expected at the end
of August. If a coupon issue is offered in the financing, as appears
possible, it is likely to have an attractive enough yield to generate
some selling of intermediate-term issues for swapping purposes as well

I -5
as leading to some shifts out of time deposits. Under those conditions,
the yield spread favoring corporates over Government bonds may narrow
further, as it has been since Government bond yields began rising in
mid-July. And a further narrowing of the spread could feed back and
exert upward pressure on corporate rates themselves.
Leveling off in corporate bond prices during July and
additional large savings inflows to thrift institutions have apparently
been reflected in little further recent change in yields on home
mortgages. Although the immediate outlook for prices of Federally-
underwritten mortgages still seems to hinge closely on the behavior of
corporate bond prices, availability of funds to mortgage borrowers at
going yields should remain relatively ample.
In the absence of dramatic increases in market rates, or
sudden and unexpected shifts in consumer saving, non-bank depositary-
type financial institutions should continue to receive sizable inflows
in the period ahead. Inflows of savings to non-bank financial inter-
mediaries appear to have continued in near record volume during July
and to have been especially impressive within the most interest sensi-
tive areas. In addition, early August inflows to New York City's
largest savings banks continue to be larger than a year ago, although
these instituions had fully reversed the reduction in savings by that
time.

I- 6
Banking-outlook
Over the remaining weeks of the summer, bank credit growth
will continue to be sustained by Treasury financings. Banks are likely
to have increased their holdings of Treasury securities, net, in the
recent refunding, and to participate actively in the Treasury cash
offering expected to be paid for in late August. Banks can also be
expected to continue acquiring other securities, although at a rate
remaining below the unusually high rates of late winter and spring.
The recent drop in acquisition of other securities to a more moderate
pace in part may reflect the rising returns available on more marketable
short-term assets--especially Treasury securities--and also may reflect
preparation for the acceleration of loan demands that many banks believe
may occur in the fall.
However, it is not clear how strong a loan demand can be
expected in the coming months. On balance, it appears that business
loan expansion may be modest, as demands to finance inventories remain
small, although tax payments may tend to increase loan demands somewhat
in September and October. The possibility of an auto strike poses
additional uncertainties for the loan outlook.
Time deposit inflows may be somewhat restrained in coming
months by the markets' absorption of the new Treasury securities likely
to be issued at the end of this month and over the balance of the year.
An issue of new securities by the Treasury in the 3 -5 year maturity
range, given current market rates, could induce the public to shift
some of its funds from financial institutions to a relatively liquid

I- 7
market instrument with an attractive coupon. The part of Treasury new
cash raised through tax bills is also likely to restrain time deposit
inflows by making sales of CD's more difficult. Under the circumstances,
banks are likely to raise CD rates and their demands on the Euro-dollar
market are likely to be strong, even if domestic loan demands are modest.
The expansion of the money stock in the early fall is
unlikely to be as rapid as in recent months. Some rebuilding of cash
balances has already occurred. Moreover, Treasury deposits are not
expected to decline, and therefore should not contribute to the growth
of private balances to the degree observed in late spring and early
summer.
Balance of payments
The merchandise trade balance has not improved further since
April. Exports have leveled off and imports have not declined as
expected. Some renewed improvement in the balance is still hoped for
during the second half year. Even with no early European economic
upturn in sight, a rise in exports--mainly of agricultural products--
to other areas is expected to increase total exports. Meanwhile,
imports, which remain larger in relation to GNP than at any time before
mid-1966 despite marked easing in pressures on domestic manufacturing
capacity, are not expected to advance significantly for several months.
Nevertheless, with near-term trade prospects less encouraging
than before, and with no prospect of net improvement in other current
transactions or of reductions in net outflows of U.S. capital, there is

I- 8
little reason to expect the liquidity deficit (before special trans-
actions) to be much smaller in the second half year than in the first
half, unless specific measures are taken to improve the balance of
payments.
Second quarter figures, to be released next week, will show
the liquidity deficit about unchanged from the first quarter, seasonally
adjusted, bringing the total for the half year to $1.1 billion. Without
special official transactions, the deficit would have been twice as
large as this during the first half year and would have increased from
the first quarter to the second. Weekly indicators for July suggest a
continued deficit at about the first half year rate.
On the official reserve transactions basis, which is little
affected by special transactions, the second quarter deficit will be
published at about $900 million, seasonally adjusted--only half the
record first-quarter deficit but still very large. In June and July,
however, this volatile balance was apparently small as U.S. banks
received funds from the Euro-dollar market through their foreign
branches.

THE ECONOMIC PICTURE IN DETAIL
The Nonfinancial Scene
Gross national product. The rate of economic growth is
expected to continue to accelerate throughout this year even if
higher tax rates go into effect as proposed. Assuming both the 10
per cent surcharge on corporate and personal taxes proposed by the
Administration and an increase in Federal civilian and military pay
of $1.5 billion, we would expect GNP in the fourth quarter to increase
by $16.5 billion. This would be $2.5 billion larger than the third
quarter rise and in real terms the economy would be growing at a 4.5
per cent annual rate, compared with an estimated 4 per cent in the
present quarter.
The major over-all effect of the assumed tax increase in
the fourth quarter is to moderate what would otherwise be an even
more expansive situation, with its initial impact operating mainly to
restrain consumer expenditures. By next year, the lower profit and
disposable income resulting from the tax increase could have a more
pervasive impact on private final sales and possibly could slow real
growth in GNP. Without a tax rise, a quickened pace of inventory
rebuilding, rising government expenditures and sharply rising income
due to faster growth in employment and stepped-up wage increases, could
result in a GNP increase as high as $20 billion in the fourth quarter,
implying significantly stronger pressures on resource use and prices.

II -2
A further tapering off in the inventory drag followed in the
fourth quarter by moderate restocking is likely to be a major factor
contributing to the strength in GNP, The large June reduction in the
book value of business inventories of $5.6 billion, annual rate--with
the first decline in manufacturing inventories in three years--
probably marks the end of an important phase of the recent adjustment.1/
Reflecting the large inventory liquidation in June and the sustained
increase in new orders, as well as strike settlements, industrial
output rose in July. But, with final sales expected to continue
strong and output still only rising slowly, further inventory liquida-
tion will likely take place in manufacturing in the present quarter
and stock-sales ratios should decline considerably. Also, dealer
stocks of autos are likely to be further reduced this quarter, es-
pecially if, as we have assumed, a limited strike takes place in the
automobile industry in September. Thus, some net liquidation of
business inventories in the third quarter is likely and this may
exert an additional $2 to $3 billion drag on GNP in the present
quarter.
By the final quarter, however, some rebuilding of inven-
tores is projected. Thus, in contrast to the first three quarters
1/ Because the reduction in inventories in June was larger than
had been assumed, the inventory change initially reported by the
Commerce Department for the second quarter will probably be revised
down by perhaps as much as $2 billion and the revised figures would
then show little, if any, accumulation for the second quarter.
However, this downward revision is likely to be largely offset in
total GNP by upward revisions in final sales, particularly in con-
sumer expenditures for nondurable goods.

II -3
when indicated reductions in inventory investment exerted a strong
negative influence, additions to inventory should become an expansive
force in the economy.
Sharply rising personal income has become an increasingly
important expansive force supporting increasing consumer expenditures.
In June and July nonfarm employment increased by almost 500,000, and
as a result, personal income in June rose $3.7 billion, annual rate,
almost three times the rise in the previous two months, and another
sizable increase is indicated in July. In part reflecting higher
incomes, retail sales in June also rose sharply--retail sales have
now been revised upward to show an increase of more than 2 per cent
instead of the little change indicated by the "advance" estimate.
Unit sales of domestic autos increased to an annual rate of 8.4
million in June and this rate was maintained in July. Nondurable
sales also accelerated in June to a new high and apparently in-
creased further in July. In the coming months, employment gains
are expected to continue to be relatively large, as manufacturing
and other industrial activities pick up momentum. In addition, a
Federal pay raise will add to total earnings in the fourth quarter.
Thus, without a tax increase in the fourth quarter, consumption ex-
penditures would be expected to show continued large increases.
If the tax increase goes into effect on October 1, higher
withholding taxes on personal income would be imposed immediately
with a consequent impact on consumer expenditures. Growth in total
final sales is projected to decline from an annual rate of $17

II -4
billion in the third quarter to $14 billion in the fourth quarter,
almost entirely because of a slower rise in consumer outlays. Durable
goods expenditures are projected, consequently, to show no change in
the last quarter, although an increase in new car prices is likely.
The gain in nondurable goods expenditures is expected to be relatively
small and only services would continue to expand as rapidly as in the
current quarter. Moreover, in order to maintain this projected level
of consumer outlays the savings rate would likely decline--the usual
pattern of response when personal tax increases are imposed--to 5.8
per cent in the fourth quarter. This would be down sharply from the
exceptionally high 7.3 per cent first quarter rate and about at the
1965-1966 average.
We have not assumed any increase in social security benefits
for the fourth quarter on the grounds that it is not possible to re-
calculate and process payments between the time a bill can be passed
and the end of the year. However, if the current House bill event-
ually is passed, over $3 billion would be added to disposable income,
probably in the first quarter of 1968. In effect this would offset
around half of the increase of over $6 billion in personal tax re-
ceipts stemming from the 10 per cent surcharge.
In the other private sectors, imposition of the surcharge
largely would be felt in 1968 rather than in the fourth quarter of
this year. It seems unlikely that the higher corporate tax would
significantly influence plans for plant and equipment spending in the
short-run. The effect of the tax on current profits has been partly

II -5
offset by the reinstitution of the investment credit. Meahwhile, new
orders for machinery and equipment have increased by 13 per cent since
February, order backlogs rose moderately in May and June, and in July
producers expanded output of machinery. In line with these develop-
ments and recent anticipation surveys, business fixed investment is
projected to show modest gains in both the third and fourth quarters.
Nor should the tax rise, which might be expected to stim-
ulate construction by reducing money market pressures, have much in-
fluence on expenditures for residential construction in the fourth
quarter. Recent commitments and housing starts, which will largely
determine fourth quarter activity, indicate that the recent upward
trend in residential activity is likely to be maintained. Expendi-
tures for housing may rise by $1.6 billion and $2.0 billion,
respectively, in the third and fourth quarters.
The Government contribution to final sales also is expected
to be large in this and the next quarter. Defense costs are increas-
ing (we continue to incorporate an additional $4 billion above the
January Budget estimate for defense outlays in our projections--this
is also the amount of "add-on" now suggested by the Administration
for fiscal 1968); moreover, the civilian and military pay raise is
likely to add at least $1.5 billion to Federal outlays in the fourth
quarter. As a result, the increases in both defense and nondefense
expenditures are expected to be larger in the fourth than in the
current quarter. With State and local outlays rising as rapidly as

II -6
earlier, total Government expenditures are projected to be up $5
billion in this quarter and $6 billion in the fourth quarter,
accounting for almost half the rise in final sales in the fourth
quarter.
As already indicated, the anticipated inventory turnaround
and rising Government expenditures provide important offsets to the
moderating influence of the tax increase; real GNP is projected to
rise in the fourth quarter, and use of both industrial capacity
and manpower resources will increase. The possiblity of passing
through higher business costs to prices are also likely to increase.
The sizable increases in unit labor costs in the past year have not
yet been reflected fully in industrial prices and further upward
pressures on costs should result from recent and prospective labor
contracts. Prices, as measured by the GNP deflator, are projected
to be rising at an annual rate of 3.0 per cent in the final quarter
excluding the impact of the Federal pay raise on the deflator, com-
pared with 2.4 per cent in the second quarter.

Industrial production. Industrial production is tentatively
estimated to have increased one-half point or more in July from the
preliminary June level of 155.2 per cent. At an estimated 155.8, the
total index would be one per cent below a year earlier and two per cent
below the December peak.
The July rise is primarily due to settlements of strikes in
the electrical machinery and rubber industries and a 6 per cent increase
in crude oil production in response to the mid-East situation. Other
output changes in July appear to be about offsetting with likely
declines in furniture, construction materials, paper, some chemical
products, and copper (because of a strike) about balanced by increased
output of autos, nonelectrical machinery, commercial aircraft, defense
equipment, and petroleum refining. Production in most other industries,
including steel, apparently changed little.
Estimating output changes in July are more hazardous than
iJe most other months because of the sharp seasonal curtailment in
output; the seasonal factors allow for a 6 per cent decline in the total
index from June to July. Moreover, the year the shift forward of the
auto model changeover, the timing of strikes and strike settlements, and
the effects on production of the riots further complicate the problem
of estimating production changes.
If a strike in the auto industry can be avoided and if the
copper strike can be settled before shortaLes affect output of consumer
goods and business equipment, the testing period for the strength of
expansion in industrial production will be between now and October, when

II '8
over-all production usually reaches its seasonal high for the year
8 per cent above the summer seasonal low.
Retail sales. June retail sales are now shown to have been
more than 2 per cent above May, rather than just slightly higher, and
4 per cent above a year earlier. The new estimates indicate higher June
sales volume for nearly all types of stores, durable and nondurable,
than the advance estimates. Sales at durable goods stores in June were
up nearly 4 per cent. While sales at furniture and appliance stores
are still shown to be down from May, the decline now indicated is sub-
stantially less than reported previously. Sales of nondurable goods in
June are now shown to be up nearly 1.5 per cent from May with the
declines indicated earlier for food and apparel stores reversed. The
figures now show a 3 per cent rise for apparel stores.
With the revised June figures, retail sales in the second
quarter were up 1.8 per cent from the first quarter. Unit sales of new
U.S.-made autos were up considerably.from the first quarter, while sales
at other durable goods stores declined slightly. At nondurable goods
stores, second quarter sales were up 1.7 per cent from the first quarter,
with relatively large increases at stores other than food.
In July, according to weekly sales figures, sales continued
at the high June rate, both at durable goods and nondurable goods stores.

II -9
Auto markets. Despite some weakening of domestic new car
sales in the last 10 days of July, the seasonally adjusted annual rate
for the month as a whole was 8.4 million units, unchanged from the
preceding month and up slightly from the 8.3 million rate a year earlier.
Trade reports indicate that supply limitations in some popular models
were beginning to affect sales, as is usual at this season of the year;
consumer demand is expected by the trade to remain strong through the
introduction of new models in September.
The stock of new cars was sharply reduced in July and at
month end, at 1.18 million units, was 16 per cent below the end of June
and about one-fourth below the level a year earlier, reflecting the
sustained high level of sales and early termination of the 1967 model-
year output. At the July selling rate, stocks at the end of the month
represented 47 days' supply--a relatively normal level at this stage
of the model year.
Prices of used cars (seasonally adjusted) reported in the
Consumer Price Index declined slightly in June for the first time in
five months.
Consumer credit. Consumers incurred instalment debt in June
at a more rapid rate than in any other month since the slowdown in
instalment credit began early last year. The June spurt resulted from
a combination of factors. A few finance companies promoted travel and
vacation loans in competition with bank credit cards, and with unpreced-
ented success. Automobile sales picked up sharply in June giving rise

II -10
to the largest auto credit volume since last November. Some durable
goods such as air conditioners, which normally have peak sales in the
warm months, were offered early in the year on a delayed-payment basis,
and these contracts were carried on the books for the first time in
June. In fact, demands for all major types of instalment credit were
larger than in earlier months this year.
Although repayments increased somewhat to record levels in
June, they rose less than extensions. Nevertheless, expansion in instal-
ment credit continues far below 1966.

The instalment debt burden of consumers, measured by the
ratio of outstandings to disposable income, amounted to 13.8 per cent
the first and second quarters of 1967, about the same proportion as in

II -11
the first quarter of last year and somewhat lower than in the remainder
of the year. While both extensions and repayments have moved up slightly
relative to disposable income, both are below the ratios of a year
earlier.
New and unfilled orders. New orders received by manufacturers
edged up 0.6 per cent in June, with the rise concentrated in the durable
goods sector which was up 1.4 per cent. Orders for nondurables were
unchanged. The June increases brought orders for manufactured goods to
a level less than 1 per cent below the peak of last September. Orders
for durables have recovered about two-thirds of their earlier decline
and are now only 4 per cent below the September peak.
Among durable goods industries, increases were concentrated
in machinery and aircraft which were up 5 per cent and 11 per cent,
respectively. New orders for steel, fabricated metals, motor vehicles,
and all other durables were down slightly. The special machinery and
equipment grouping showed a 4 per cent increase and the defense products
category--which includes commercial aircraft--was up 7 per cent from
May and 30 per cent from the average for the first four months of the
year.
Unfilled orders for manufactured goods rose 1.5 per cent
further in June. Three-fourths of this rise was accounted for by an
increase in backlogs for aircraft. Backlogs at steel mills were up
5 per cent. Changes in unfilled orders in other industries were minor.

II -12
Shipments. The value of manufacturers' shipments edged down
0.2 per cent in June from the level of the previous month. There was
considerable stability throughout the list of industries. Sales of
durables were up very slightly while nondurables showed a small decline.
Shipments from steel mills were off 2 per cent, while non-ferrous metals
were up 4 per cent and machinery was up 1.5 per cent.
Construction and real-estate. The value of new construction
put in place increased further in July for the third consecutive month,
based on confidential July projections available from the Census Bureau
and on slightly revised data for all earlier months of this year. Con-
struction outlays in July, although 4 per cent below the peak in early
1966, were again above their declining level a year earlier. While
private nonresidential activity apparently changed little further from
its reduced level, public construction edged upward and private resi-
dential expenditures were higher for the seventh straight month.

Seasonally adjusted private housing starts, which rose
sharply in May above the plateau reached in the previous three months,
were down somewhat in June to 1,209,000 units, but once again exceeded
their reduced year-ago level. During the second quarter, starts averaged
7 per cent above the first quarter rate and 31 per cent above the 1966
fourth quarter low, according to newly-revised Census Bureau data. One
of the most marked improvements during the first half came in the West,
where starts had been in a downtrend for several years prior to 1967.
In June, residential building permits--now one of the major
NBER leading indicators--increased somewhat further, with 1-family
structures again the dominant factor. Regionally, permits rose in the
Northeast and West; elsewhere, they changed little.

Note: Starts data reflect one-time Census Bureau revisions, going
back to 1963 and incorporating improved estimation and adjust-
ment procedures which have reduced previously-published starts
levels in 1966 and 1967 by about 4 per cent. Newly-revised
seasonal indexes have tended to lower former seasonally adjusted
starts levels slightly during the first half of the year and to
raise them slightly during the second half.

II -14
With housing output developing enough mqmentum to more than
exceed the normal spring rise (three-fifths) and with permits higher,
the prospect for an additional advance in starts was further enhanced
by a second quarter decline in vacancies. Vacancy rates for both rental
and home-owner units were down, reflecting the sharply reduced volume
of new completions, with rental vacancies at the lowest quarterly levels
since 1959. The greatest year-over-year reduction in rental vacancies
was in the West, as shown in the table. In line with the recent decline
in vacancies since 1965, the rent component of the consumer price index
has been edging up at a somewhat faster rate.

Business inventories. A sharp downward adjustment in the
rate of inventory accumulation by manufacturers turned between January
and May into sizable liquidation in June, and, with the liquidation at
distributors that began in February continuing, the book value of total
business inventories declined over $450 million, according to preliminary
figures.

II -1
The substantive June decline exceeded the combined April-May
increase (when accumulation by manufacturers more than offset liquida-
tion by distributors), and the book value of nonfarm business inventories
now shows a slight decrease for the quarter as a whole. The table shows
in some detail the massive inventory adjustment that took place between
the fourth quarter 1966 and the second quarter of this year.

1/ Preliminary
The June shift to inventory liquidation at manufacturers
(totaling $160 million) reflected primarily a large reduction in stocks
(mainly finished goods) in nondurable goods industries. Shipments of
nondurable goods in June were slightly below the record May level, but

II -16
for the second quarter as a whole they were up 2 per cent from the
first quarter, equaling producers' anticipations as reported in the
May Commerce survey. Owing mainly to the June drop, inventories held
by nondurable goods manufacturers showed only a fractional net increase
for the quarter--much less than anticipated--and the stock-sales ratio
held at a level only moderately above a year earlier.
Among durable goods manufacturing industries, inventories
continued to run off in the auto industry. From February through June
stocks declined $300 million, or 8 per cent, as shipments spurted
sharply. Some liquidation also was reported by other consumer durable
industries and in construction materials. Inventory declines in these
lines were offset by continued accumulation, mainly of work-in-process
stocks, in the business and defense equipment sector, and all durable
goods industries combined showed a slight net accumulation. For the
second quarter as a whole, sales by durable goods producers were down
from the first quarter (and from the fourth quarter peak) and well
below anticipations; however, in marked contrast to the late 1965 and
1966 experience, inventory accumulation also fell short of anticipa-
tions. The durable goods stock-sales ratio in June was down moderately
from the April peak but still well above a year earlier.
Distributors' stocks declined about $300 million further in
June. Total liquidation since January amounted to nearly $1.2 billion,
of which $1.1 billion was in durable goods lines, bringing the stock-
sales ratio generally down to a viable level. In June, as in earlier

II -17
months, a substantial part of the liquidation was at auto dealers.
Other durable goods retailers also reported a sizable further stock
decline in June, and the reduction in inventories at durable goods
wholesalers was again large.
Labor market. The tone of the labor market improved further
in July. Nonfarm employment rose by 200,000 following a substantial
(upward revised) pick-up in June, bringing the level close to a half
million above its recent low in May.
The over-all unemployment rate edged downward to 3.9 per cent
in July. Despite the entry of some 3 million teenage workers between
May and July, their unemployment rate has remained relatively unchanged
in the past two months as most successfully obtained jobs. Significantly,
the decline in unemployment this past month was mainly among adult men;
their rate of unemployment fell to 2.4 per cent.
Although most of the employment growth in July occurred in
State and local government and services, moderate gains were also
evident in construction, transportation and trade. Manufacturing
employment edged downward somewhat, but this was largely the result of
technical factors. With continued strong growth in public and private
services, evidence of recovery in construction employment, and adjust-
ments in manufacturing employment and weekly hours apparently largely
completed, nonfarm employment should continue vigorous growth later this
year as over-all demand accelerates.
With demand for labor again expanding, the labor force appears
now to have regained its momentum after several months of relatively slow

II -18
growth. In July the civilian labor force increased by 250,000, and
was 1.7 million (the total labor force was up over 2 million) above a
year earlier. This rate of growth is well above the "normal" trend
for the labor force, based upon growth in the population of working age
and the long-term increase in participation of women.
Nonfarm employment. The 200,000 increase in nonfarm employ-
ment in July raised the year-to-year gain to 1-3/4 million. Indications
of firming in labor markets were fairly widespread. In manufacturing,
a 40,000 drop in employment was largely the result of special circum-
stances. A decline of 20,000 in durable goods employment reflected
mainly a sharp seasonal cut in auto employment as a result of the early
model changeover. The BLS makes no special adjustment for changes in
the timing of model changeovers; such an adjustment is made in the
production index, however. Among other durable goods industries,
machinery showed some strength, responding to a pick-up in new orders,
but fabricated metals, lumber and furniture were off somewhat. The
25,000 increase in electrical equipment represented a return from strike.
In nondurable goods industries, a drop of 20,000 jobs
reflected a cutback of that magnitude in apparel, probably a seasonal
drop not adequately eliminated by the seasonal adjustment procedure.
Other nondurable goods industries showed only small and offsetting
employment changes.
Producers in manufacturing, in some cases still wrestling
with an overhang of inventories, were apparently not yet ready in July

II -19
to increase their payrolls significantly. Nevertheless, the relative
employment stability in July, following a pick-up of 60,000 jobs in
June and a modest rise in accessions and reduction in separations,
suggest that manufacturing is ready for a resumption of employment
growth in the coming months. The beginning of production of the new
auto models, and the return to work of some 50,000 or more rubber
workers who were on strike in mid-July should alone provide the basis
for an employment increase in August.
At the same time, employers still seem to be concerned with
the need to restrain rising labor costs, and are doing so by limiting
overtime. Average weekly hours in manufacturing, at 40.3 in July, were
little changed from June--the total was up one-tenth of an hour over
the month, while overtime was down one-tenth. The average workweek in
July was seven-tenths of an hour below the level of January, and of
July a year ago.
Outside of manufacturing, employment demand continued
particularly strong in the private services and in government. These
sectors provided three quarters of the employment increase in the past
month, and two-thirds of the additional jobs in the nonfarm economy
over the past year. In the period of relative job slack from January
to May, they provided all of the employment growth. In the past month,
however, construction and trade were up by about 30,000 each. The
evidence of improvement in the construction picture was also supported
by a rise of three-tenths in that industry's workweek. Average hours
in construction are now only three-tenths of an hour below July a year
ago.

II -20
Collective bargaining. Settlements of several major wage
negotiations in the past few weeks, following strikes, have set an
example for wage and fringe benefit increases which is likely to be
followed in the second half of 1967. Several recent wage settlements
have been in the 5 per cent range, higher than the 4-1/2 per cent
average for 1966. The rubber agreements, which settled strikes affect-
ing four producers, provided wage increases ofover 5 per cent for most
rubber workers, and somewhat over 4 per cent for tire workers. The RCA
settlement with the Electrical Workers in early July--ending a one
month strike--involved a wage increase of about 4 per cent.
In addition to wage rate increases, unions in most cases are de-
mandingnew or enhanced fringe benefits which are adding substantially
to the total cost of packages. Along with liberalized health, welfare,
pensions and other fringes, there have been several recent demands for
variants of guaranteed annual income programs; the rubber workers had
their supplemental unemployment (SUB) benefits raised from 65 to 80 per
cent of wages. The cost of these fringes has been substantial; the
total packages in rubber and electrical equipment are estimated to
involve increases in total compensation of over 6 per cent.
In major industry negotiations still under way, the Steel
Workers, who represent most of the 37,000 striking copper mining and
smelting workers, are asking for a 5 to 6 per cent wage increase, the
Railroad Shopcraft Unions are asking for about 6-1/2 per cent, and the
auto wage demands appear to be in the same range.

II -21
Large wage adjustments have by no means been limited to the
unionized sectors, and many nonunion settlements in fact have been at
the higher end of the range. Increases of at least 5 per cent have
been widespread. For example, pay raises of up to 6.5 per cent were
granted in early August in the largely nonunion southern textile mills.
The recent uptrend in consumer prices has also led to demands
by both copper and electrical unions for cost-of-living escalator clauses;
this demand was not granted in the contract signed by RCA, and the copper
contract is still being negotiated. But, demands for a renewal of the
cost-of-living clause in the auto and agricultural equipment contracts
can certainly be expected. In a period of rising prices, these clauses
can add substantially to the total wage bill. In autos, during 1966,
cost-of-living benefits totaled 11 cents, adding about 3 per cent (in
addition to other negotiated benefits) to the basic wage rate in the
industry.
Unit labor costs. The July revisions in national income
data have resulted in a sharp upward adjustment of earlier estimates
of unit labor costs in manufacturing. The Census index, at 106.2 per
cent of the 1957-59 average in the second quarter of 1967, was at the
highest level in the post-World War II period. These costs are now
running 5-1/2 per cent higher than a year ago; as compared with an
increase of about 4-1/2 per cent shown prior to the revision.

3/ Manufacturing output (FRB) per manhour.
The sharp spurt in unit labor costs is a function of both
the continued growth in compensation per manhour and the reduced rate
of productivity increase that has accompanied the dip in output in the
past half year. Output per manhour in manufacturing in the first two
quarters of 1967 averaged only one per cent above the year-earlier
levels. With productivity in manufacturing growing at so slow a rate,
virtually all the over-the-year increases in wages and supplements have
been translated into increased unit labor costs. Wages and supplements
are continuing to expand at a brisk rate, and little easing in pressure
on unit labor costs can thus be anticipated until a substantial recovery
develops in manufacturing productivity--which should accompany the antic-
ipated pick-up in production later this year.

II -23
Prices. After rising 0.5 per cent a month in May and June,
the comprehensive wholesale price index rose only 0.2 per cent further
in July--to 106.5 per cent of the 1957-59 average--according to the
BLS preliminary estimate. Prices of farm products and processed foods
and feeds, which had been responsible for the abrupt and sharp upturn
in May and June, rose only moderately further in July, but average
industrial prices increased 0.1 per cent following 4 months of stability.
The spurt in wholesale prices--particularly for meats and fresh fruits
and vegetables--brought the earlier decline in retail food prices to an
end in May and led to a sharp rise in June. With retail prices of non-
food commodities continuing to rise--although at a slower pace than
earlier in the year--and services going on up, the June rise in the
consumer price index was stepped up; for May and June the increase was
at an average annual rate of 3.5 per cent as compared with less than
1 per cent in the first quarter, when food prices were declining.
Wholesale prices of farm products, which had increased 5 per
cent from April to June--recovering half the large decline from last
September--leveled off in July; and processed foods and feeds increased
0.5 per cent as compared with a 2-1/2 per cent gain from April to June.
(If allowance is made for the usual seasonal change, prices of farm
products and foods and feeds declined in July.) Following the unex-
pectedly sharp drop from late April to the end of May, hog marketings
and pork production have shown substantial recovery and prices have
eased. Beef production in June and July was relatively stable, below

II -24
the highs reached earlier in the year and prices continued to edge up.
Prices of fresh produce in July reportedly reversed part of the sharp
run-up in May and June, as summer crops improved supplies that had
been curtailed by poor late-spring weather. However, prices of pro-
cessed fruits and vegetables apparently continued upward. With record
crops in prospect which will more than meet anticipated domestic and
foreign needs, prices of wheat declined further in July and at mid-
month were a fifth below a year earlier; corn prices also showed a
decrease.
Price declines for sensitive industrial materials, which
slowed the rise in the index for industrial commodities from mid-1966
to early 1967 despite continuing advances for other materials and for
finished products, persisted in the first half of this year. Moreover,
under the generally slack economic conditions the earlier upward move-
ment in prices of other materials and of consumer and producer goods
slowed appreciably, with the result that the BLS wholesale industrial
composite was stable from February through June. At 106 per cent of
the 1957-59 average, this index in June was 1 per cent above a year
earlier--with sensitive materials down nearly 7 per cent; from June
1965 to June 1966 the over-all index had increased almost 2.5 per cent.
From mid-June to mid-July, the BLS estimates a slight upturn
in the industrial commodity index and in recent weeks additional price
increases have been announced. While prices for some industrial
materials remain weak--e.g., hides and some textiles--prices of copper
scrap (and of primary copper sold in dealers' market) have strengthened

II -25
as a result of growing concern about the duration of the current labor
dispute; with the pick-up in building activity proceeding, lumber prices
have risen further and higher prices have been announced for aluminum
siding and gypsum products (the latter to be effective in mid-September);
moderate price increases for crude petroleum have spread throughout the
industry as domestic crude oil production moved up to a record volume
to make up for a diminished flow from the Mid-East; and moderate price
increases have been announced--effective in early September--for tin-
coated steel (tinplate) and uncoated steel (black plate) used in the
manufacture of cans. Among finished products, prices of various types
of machinery and some types of furniture and appliances were apparently
higher in mid-July than in June; and since mid-July tire and tube prices
have been increased, the sharp spurt in silver prices has resulted in
higher prices for silverware and some photographic film, and some
producers have announced substantially higher price schedules for 1968-
model trucks.

II -26
Farm incomes. Realized net incomes of farm operators have
been declining gradually since late 1966 from the $16.5 bil-ion annual
rate maintained throughout the first three quarters of 1966. Lower
farm prices until April were a factor in the downtrend, but not the
only one, A larger volume of marketings and near record government
payments have moderated the effect of price declines on cash receipts but
rising prices of items used in production and higher interest and wage
rates have steadily trimmed net earnings.
First half of 1967. Net realized income in the first half
of 1967 averaged 11 per cent below a year earlier. Cash receipts were
only 2 per cent less and with imputed value of home grown food and house
rent and government payments included, gross realized incomes were
even closer to the year-earlier level. But production expens s were
5 per cent larger than a year earlier.

II -27
These national averages concealed widely disparate returns
to producers of specific commodities, For hog producers and poultrymen,
cash receipts were down 11 and 9 per cent respectively, with a substantially
increased volume of marketings sold for sharply lower prices. Dairy
receipts were up 11 per cent entirely because of higher prices. Crop
receipts were about the same as a year earlier except for cotton, corn,
and oranges, Receipts from corn were 12 per cent above last year with
both marketings and prices higher but cotton sales receipts were
down 58 per cent reflecting sharply reduced production and lower prices
provided by the 1965 acreage diversion program. Reduced cotton receipts
were compensated by direct payments to producers. Orange marketings
were 42 per cent larger than the year before, but cash returns were
down 15 per cent because of lower prices.
Increases in production expenses resulted mainly from higher
prices paid for productive inputs and larger outlays for taxes and
interest. Prices of feed, machinery, and building materials were up
substantially from a year earlier. Fertilizer prices were unchanged
but more was purchased because of larger acreages planted this year.
Prices of feeder and replacement livestock were down and the volume
of purchases was less than a year earlier.
1966 income, Last year's net realized income, the most
favorable in twenty years, resulted from strong demands for livestock
supplies, still limited by earlier retrenchments in production, and crop
stocks deliberately drawn down from surplus, Strong demand and somewhat

II -28
limited supplies pushed farm prices to the highest levels since the
Korean War bulge. Livestock prices were sustained at high levels
until toward the end of the year when expanding production pushed
prices down, Crop prices bulged in the middle of the year because
of sharply expanded demands for stocks associated with the world
food shortage scare but declined by harvest time.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL SITUATION
Bank credit. All of the aggregate measures indicate a sharp
acceleration in the growth of bank credit during July. To some extent,
however, the expansion indicated in the table may be exaggerated. The
inability of seasonal adjustment techniques to correct for rapidly
shifting patterns of tax payments and Treasury financings have contri-
buted to sharp month-to-month fluctuations in the bank credit series
which make it extremely difficult to judge underlying trends. Thus,
the unusually rapid expansion of bank credit indicated for July may be
in part illusory, but it also may reflect some strengthening of loan
demands, at least in the short run.

After declining late in June, Government security holdings
of banks expanded sharply in July, with acquisitions of the new tax
anticipation bills--payable with full tax and loan credit--widespread
among banks. The increase in holdings of Treasury issues accounted for

III -2
about one-third of the total increase in bank earning assets and
about one-half of the acceleration in bank credit from June to
July. However, for the second consecutive month, the pace of acqui-
sition of other securities moderated from the unusually high rate
over the first 5 months of the year. While some banks are apparently
still interested in the attractively priced participation certificates
and longer-term municipals, the combination of current and prospective
loan demands and the ability to obtain relatively high yielding--
and more liquid--other short-term financial assets, particularly
Treasury issues, has contributed to a lessened general interest in
tax-exempt securities.

The statistics indicate an unusually rapid rate of growth in
total bank loans in July, following quite modest expansion in May and
June, but shifting seasonal factors mentioned above, and the difficulty
of estimating window-dressing at midyear may have resulted in an
overstatement in the indicated growth of total loans.

III -3
Business loans were particularly affected by seasonal
adjustment problems. With withholding tax payments shifted forward,
the previously normal repayment of June tax borrowing in July failed
to appear. Discussions with individual bankers on balance suggest
that the "seasonally adjusted" rates of growth shown by the statistics
for business loans in June and July do not fully conform with bankers'
own views of their current loan demands. Indeed, some business loan
repayments began to develop in late July and early August, although
some of the early August decline in business loans reflected the use
of proceeds from a debenture issue by a major oil company. Despite
the increasing cost of capital market financing, there is no evidence
of a step-up in term loans.
Among the other major loan categories, security financing
rose in July, reflecting not only financing requirements ef Government
security dealers whose inventories rose over the month, but also
increased financing demands of other dealers. Finance companies repaid
their modest June borrowing and continued to reduce their bank loans
in July as the cost of market financing remained below the prime rate.
Expansion in real estate loans remained modest, with some further
step-up at weekly reporting banks,
Bank deposits. All forms of bank deposits expanded sharply
in July. Total time and savings deposits increased at a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 14.5 per cent, a little below the average of
the first half. As indicated in the last line of the table, weekly

reporting banks were able to maintain the combined inflow Of passbook
savings and time deposits other than large denomination negotiable
CD's. Indeed, bank inflows in July were unusually strong relative to

1966 when consideration is given to the large transfers of funds from
nonbank institutions to banks in July of last year. There was no
apparent large shift from bank deposits to other financial assets
after the interest crediting period this year.
After essentially no growth in outstanding CD's over the
second quarter, weekly reporting banks added over $500 million of CD's
in July and New York and Chicago banks further increased outstandings
by almost $300 million in early August. Preliminary reports for July
suggest that weekly reporting banks were able to increase somewhat
the average maturity of CD sales--particularly among banks outside
of New York and Chicago. The average maturity of outstandings, however,
remained below the April level.

III -3
The sharp increase in outstanding CD's since the June tax
date reflects both increased bank aggressiveness and a more receptive
corporate market. With the expectation of both expanded future credit
demands and rising short-term yields, banks have increased their efforts
to tap the CD market. Offering rates continued to rise somewhat in
July so that despite increases in yields on competing money market
instruments, the relative attractiveness of CD's remained high by
historical standards. Corporations since the mid-June tax date have
been in a better position to take advantage of these rates. Inflows
from capital market financing have remained large, and, depsite the
increased withholding tax payments, the end of the much larger accele-
ration in corporate income tax payments has permitted businesses to
allocate a greater proportion of their cash inflows to money market
assets. In the second quarter, large tax payments limited corporate
acquisitions of such assets, and their holdings of CD's declined on
balance during that period.
Bank efforts to obtain additional funds and the greater
relative rate attractiveness of continental money markets have also
contributed to increased Euro-dollar borrowing in recent weeks.
After declining by about $1.6 billion from late 1966 till mid-May,
borrowing through foreign branches increased about $400 million to the
end of June and then $500 million further in July. Since mid-July,
Euro-dollar rates have become particularly favorable for domestic banks.

III -6
The money stock, on a daily average basis, expanded at
almost an 11 per cent annual rate in July, a little below the revised
average rate of growth of the money stock at an 11.6 per cent annual
rate in May and June. (It should be noted that Appendix A describes
the revisions in the money supply series which will not be made public
until late August.) However, since mid-July the money stock has
declined slightly with the gradual liquidation of Treasury bills by
commercial banks and the increased cash receipts of the Treasury.
The unusually high rate of growth of the money stock, at an annual rate
of over 15 per cent from early May to mid-July, was greatly influenced
by the very sharp decline in Treasury balances, although continued
rebuilding of private cash balances after the developments in 1966 also
contributed to the growth. With the unusually large growth of the
money stock since late spring, money balances in July are now 4.6 per
cent above the reduced level one year ago.
U.S. Government securities market. Yields on U.S. Government
securities have fluctuated over a relatively wide range in recent weeks
since mid-July, on balance, they have risen appreciably except in the
shorter bill area. Currently, yields on most Treasury obligations due
in 1-year or more are at about their highs for the year.

The recent advance in yields on intermediate and long-term
Treasury obligations was interrupted, but only temporarily, by the modest
scope of the Treasury's August refunding which was limited to a single
15-month note and did not include an intermediate-term option as had been
widely anticipated. The market's response to the refunding did not
prove to be very enthusiastic, however, and a relatively high allotment
ratio of 35 per cent was set on subscriptions from the public (with
subscriptions up to $100,000 allotted in full). The Treasury raised
about $265 million of new money in the refunding.
The President's tax message to Congress in early August
occasioned a sharp but short-lived rally in bond prices, as market
participants appeared to focus on the possibilities that Congressional
response to the new tax proposals might be delayed and the tax scaled
down. Moreover, the official forecast of a large budget deficit for

III -8
fiscal 1968 (see below), even with passage of the President's tax
recommendations, appeared to exert a cautionary influence on the market.
Another factor contributnng to an underlying note of caution in the
Treasury market has been the continuing heavy calendar of current
and prospective corporate bond flotations.
Against this background, there occurred some investor
selling of Treasury notes and bonds, partly on switches into new
corporate bond issues and into the new 15-month note of the August
refunding. But most of the selling pressure in recent trading sessions
has come from a few dealers making efforts to reduce their positions.
On balance, the dealers have been sizable net sellers of coupon issues
recently, especially of the new 15-month note in which their holdings
fell from some $410 million on August 3 to about $240 million on
August 7.
Treasury bill rates moved sharply after mid-July under the
influence of dealer selling pressure but subsequently receded from their
peaks as demand expanded at the higher yield levels. On balance, bill
rates have risen most in the 9- to 12-month maturity area and thus the
yield spread between short-dated and longer-term bill maturities
has widened further. This widening has occurred despite continued
$100 million additions to the weekly 3-month bill auctions, as the
market has focused on large new supplies of Treasury bills foreseen
in the months ahead.
Yields on most short-term market instruments other than
Treasury bills have continued to edge higher in recent weeks, as the
table shows.

Treasury finance. Shortly following the August refunding, the
Treasury will need to return to the market to raise perhaps $2 to $2-1/2
billion of net new cash. The payment date for this financing will be in
late August. Treasury officials have left open the type of issue or
issues which might be offered and have not ruled out a new note in the
5 to 7 year maturity range, if market conditions are favorable. Recent
legislation redefining Treasury notes to include maturities up to 7 years

III -10
would make possible such an issue which would not be subject to the
4-1/4 per cent interest rate ceiling.
The Treasury also indicated that its gross new money needs to
be met through issue of direct debt in the second half of this year
would total around $15 billion. This compares with $10 billion raised
in the second half of last year. Of the $15 billion total, the Treasury
has already financed $4 billion through the auction of tax bills in
July and currently is raising $100 million each week through additions
to the 3-month bill auctions. Another $1/4 billion is being raised in
the August refunding.
The $15 billion gross cash borrowing figure for the second half
does not include some $2 billion of participation certificates which the
Treasury hopes can be marketed, if necessary enabling legislation is
secured. Failure to issue any portion of these participation certificates
would imply a corresponding increase in other Treasury financing through
direct debt. No participation certificates were brought to market in
the second half of last year.
The President's Tax Message
A detailed appraisal of President Johnson's tax message will
have to await the upcoming Joint Economic Committee Hearings, since the
figures the President gave in his August 3 statement were only range
estimates concerning the Administrative Budget. Even these range
estimates contained a great amount of uncertainty. Depending on whether
the tax proposal is passed and whether spending is at the high or low

III -11
end of its projected range, it appears that the fiscal 1968 Administrative
deficit could fall anywhere between $14 and $29 billion.
In the January Budget Document, estimates for the fiscal 1968
Administrative Budget included expenditures of $135 billion and revenues
of $127 billion to make a deficit of $8 billion; the revenue estimates
included receipts from the original 6 per cent surtax proposal.
According to the August 3 message, an estimated $8.5 billion might be
added to the expenditures that had been estimated in January. This
addition can be attributed to the increased Vietnam commitment ($4 billion),
increased nondefense expenditures ($2.5 billion), and the fact that
enabling legislation for additional participation certificate sales has
not been passed ($2 billion).
An estimated $7.0 billion should be subtracted from the earlier
revenue number to reflect the January overestimate. The overestimate
is caused by earlier-than-planned restoration of the investment credit
($.8 billion), lower than expected GNP ($1.6 billion), decreased sales
of government assets ($.6 billion), a later effective date for the
surtax ($.8 billion), and an item of $3.2 billion which appears to be
attributed to the fact that an error was made in estimating taxes.
The net effect of these new estimates is to raise the
earlier deficit of $8 billion to $23.5 billion. Since this deficit
already assumes passage of the original 6 per cent surtax recommenda-
tion (worth $5 billion in fiscal 1968), the President's latest 10
per cent surtax proposal (worth $7.5 billion in fiscal 1968) would
only reduce the estimated deficit by $2.5 billion to $21 billion.
The August message suggests that this deficit could be whittled down

III -12
further to as low as $14 billion by passing enabling legislation for
participation certificates ($2 billion), eliminating part of the expected
rise in nondefense spending ($1 billion), and maximizing other expendi-
ture savings ($4 billion).
But just as it is possible to whittle down the expected $21
billion deficit by various devices, it does not take extreme assumptions
to go the other way. It has already been noted that the Administrative
deficit would be estimated at $23.5 billion if the original surtax bill
had been passed, and this deficit would be as high as $29 billion if
there were no tax increase at all. Assuming that spending related to
Vietnam does not turn out to be lower than now foreseen, the lowest
Administrative deficit that might be expected without a tax increase
would be in the neighborhood of $22 billion.
The accompanying Table shows FRB estimates of the cash and
NIA budgets. In making these estimates, we have assumed the conditions
which would give rise to the median Administrative deficit of $21
billion--that is, a 10 per cent tax increase but no savings in expendi-
tures. This appears to be a good median estimate and would also be
roughly consistent with a lesser tax increase and some further
expenditure savings.
Both the cash and NIA deficits for fiscal 1968 are now
estimated at well above the figures projected in January for the
current fiscal year. They are also well above the fiscal 1967 figures,
with the increase for the cash deficit much the larger. As a result,

projected net cash borrowing rises to a quite high level of $17.5
billion for the current fiscal year in contrast with a modest net
cash repayment of debt in fiscal 1967.
As was true in the January budget document, the cash deficit
is fiscal 1968 is lower than the Administrative because of the exclusion
of surplus-prone social insurance trust funds in the Administrative Budget,
The NIA budget shows an .even lower deficit primarily because it does
not consider the large payments under governmental credit programs
as expenditures.
Corporate and municipal bond markets. Yields on new corporate
bonds appear to have levelled off somewhat below the highs reached
late in June, while municipal yields have continued to decline. The
Administration's tax proposal came after the pricing of last week's
major issues and is not reflected in the latest yield series, but its
impact on yields was small except for a short-lived initial announcement
effect. This did stimulate investor interest in the triple A-rated
$250 million American Telephone and Telegraph issue, which had been
moving quite slowly at its reoffering yield yield of 5.95 per cent;
and by weekend the offering was nearly sold out. Similarly, several
new municipal issues were accorded increased investor attention, while
at the same time dealers removed some bonds from the market for price
mark-ups.

The dominant factor in the corporate bond market is still the
unusually large volume of new issues. Flotations of public bond offerings
in July set a new record of approximately $1.86 billion, more than four
times the volume a year ago. The volume would have been larger were it
not for more than $100 million of issues postponed or cut back in size
during July. Total bond and stock offerings, despite postponements
and reduced private placements, aggregated more than $2.5 billion,
about the same as in June.

III -16
Although public bond offerings in August are expected to
fall short of the July record, they will rank with the other outsized
months this year. Bonds currently scheduled for August total nearly
$1.6 billion and offerings may ultimately reach $1.7 billion, about
$500 million more than the August record a year earlier. In addition,
the World Bank plans to offer $150 million in bonds late in August.
Private placements are estimated to continue at the reduced July level,
but will be about the same as the takedowns recorded last year.
Looking further ahead, public offerings of corporate bonds
in September are likely to total at least $1 billion, below recent
months but historically high. Private placements during September
are expected to show a more than seasonal increase from current levels,
as takedowns increase from the rising volume of forward investment
commitments at life insurance companies. In addition, there will be
a bunching in September of corporate bonds sold earlier on a delayed
delivery basis.

State and local government security offerings in July
aggregated about $925 million, the first month this year in which
offerings fell below $1 billion. Postponements of more than $225
million in July accounted for the drop in volume from earlier estimates.
The volume of offerings in August is estimated at $950 million, but
this total may be enlarged if any decline in yields results in post-
poned issues coming back into the market, or reduced if the Kentucky
Turnpike's $120 million issue or other issues are delayed. Municipal
issues in September are expected to move back to the $1 billion mark,
however, partly for seasonal reasons and also because several large
industrial revenue issues are now scheduled for that month.

Mortgage markets. Following two months of delcine, average
secondary market prices for FHA and VA home mortgages apparently edged
down only a little in July. Near stability in prices is suggested by
FNMA and VA field reports showing mixed regional trends, and also by a

III -18
levelling off between mid-June and late July in weekly offerings of
Federally-underwritten home mortgages to FNMA for purchase under its
secondary market operations, in contrast with a marked increase over
the preceding four weeks. These developments imply that the sensitive
official secondary-market yield series for FHA home mortgages may show no
more than a minimal increase when the July results are released. In
May, this series rose by a 15 basis points, and in June by 7 points; in
the preceding five months, it had declined 52 basis points.
The tempo of institutional mortgage activity accelerated in
June. Loan closings by thrift institutions, particularly savings and
loan associations, increased more than usual. Mortgage commitments
outstanding of reporting life insurance companies, savings banks, and
savings and loan associations rose further on a seasonally adjusted
basis, reaching a combined level more than a fifth above last
December's low although still below the record high two years ago.
Sparked by the improved performance in June, total mortgage
debt outstanding again expanded more than seasonally during the second
quarter, to reach a level exceeding $356 billion. The quarterly
increase was highlighted by an upsurge in lending by savings and
loan associations, which returned to a dominant position in the reci-
dential mortgage market as measured by their share of total growth
in outstanding debt.

While net portfolio additions during the second quarter by
commercial banks and life insurance companies remained below their unusually
high levels a year earlier, acquisitions by mutual savings banks continued
upward. Net takings by the Federal National Mortgage Association, which
had reached a record high at this time last year, dipped again.
The further increases in total mortgage debt expansion during
the second quarter reflected a sharp rise in net additions to home
mortgages, stemming from the continued recovery of savings and loan
association activity. Altogether, net lending on home mortgages reached
the highest seasonally adjusted annual rate since early last year.
Multifamily and commercial mortgage debt held at about the improved
first quarter rate, and farm debt was unchanged.

Stock market. Common stock prices advanced to an all-time
high early in August, but most recently have dropped back slightly. On
August 4, Standard and Poor's index of 500 stocks closed at the record
level of 95.83, about 1,3 per cent above the previous peak reached in
early May 1966 and more than 8 per cent above the June 5 low. Stocks
listed on the American Stock Exchange reached new highs on August 7, with
the Administration's tax message temporarily interrupting the almost
continuous price rise since July.
Trading activity has continued at an unprecendented pace.
The volume of New York Stock Exchange trading averaged 10.8 million
shares a day in July. And in the week ending August 4, volume averaged
more than 12.1 million shares a day. During that week, the fourth
and fifth most active share days in the history of the NYSE were recorded;
5 of the 10 most active share days on record have now occurred in 1967,

III -21
Trading on the American Stock Exchange also continued in record volume,
and as a proportion of NYSE volume,remained near that registered at the
April 1966 speculative peak.
Speculative activity, noted in the last Greenbook, does not
appear to have abated. Low-priced common stocks appear to be the center
of this activity, as indicated by the marked volatility of these issues
and their frequent appearance on the most actively traded list. In
order to curb unwarranted activity in various stocks, the American
Stock Exchange has currently imposed 100 per cent initial margin
requirements on 28 issues--with 5 of the group places on the restriced
list August 3.
Margin panel data for June indicate margin customers were
quite active. Customers' margin debt during June advanced $190 million
to a new peak of $5,330 million. Most of the increase in margin debt,
however, was incurred by customers with relatively strong equity
positions. Since the end of last year, customers' margin debt has
risen $420 million, or 8.6 per cent.

U.S. balance of payments. The second quarter deficit on the
liquidity basis was $560 million, somewhat above earlier estimates as a
result of a revised seasonal adjustment. The deficit was held down to
the level of the first quarter by exceptionally heavy receipts on special
transactions. These transactions, which totaled about $300 million in
the first quarter, amounted to about $700 million in the second. At
present there is no indication of which items were responsible for the'
deterioration in other transactions in the second quarter: known
transactions show a modest improvement between the first and second
quarters in the balance on merchandise trade and on securities trans-
actions, but these were about offset by a shift from a net inflow to
an outflow of bank credit.
Merchandise trade. The merchandise surplus in June declined
from May as the increase in imports exceeded that for exports. The
surplus for the second quarter, however, was at an annual rate of $4.5
billion (balance of payments basis) compared with $4.0 billion in the
first quarter. Exports in the second quarter, at an annual rate of
$30.7 billion (balance of payments basis), were about the same as in
the first quarter, while second-quarter imports declined to an annual
rate of $26.3 billion.
The drop in imports was less than might have been expected
as a result of the sluggishness of the domestic economy. The ratio
of imports to GNP is still relatively high, about 3.4 per cent in
the second quarter. This high ratio reflects in considerable part

IV -2
accelerated imports of automobiles, especially from Canada, although
other imports have also remained high relative to domestic output.
The trade patterns for the entire second quarter differ
little from those in April-May, discussed in the last Green Book.
Exports of agricultural products increased only slightly
from the low level of the first quarter, while non-agricultural
exports were steady. New export orders for machinery, which showed
little movement in the first five months of this year, turned up
sharply in June (perhaps in part seasonally), and unfilled orders
rose, after having drifted downward earlier this year.
The area distribution of exports changed in the second
quarter as exports to Western Europe and Japan expanded to offset
sizeable declines in shipments to Latin America and Asia. Much of
the increased shipments to Western Europe consisted of aircraft and
machinery. The continued growth in deliveries of automobiles to
Canada under the U.S.-Canadian automotive trade agreement has
maintained total exports to that country at the first quarter rate.
In general, rising imports of automobiles have been a
major factor in sustaining total imports at relatively high levels.
As indicated by the following table, imports of automobiles and
parts from Canada have accelerated, and our export balance in such
trade has decreased sharply since inception of the Automobile
Agreement in the fourth quarter of 1965. Our balance of trade in
automobiles and parts with other countries has also deteriorated
over the past two years, as non-Canadian imports have risen sharply.

These imports in the first half of 1967 were up 4 per cent from year-ago
levels, and more than 50 per cent from the first half of 1965. Conse-
quently net U.S. exports of nearly $400 million in calendar 1965 have
been transformed into a small net import balance in the first half of
1967.
Imports of all major commodity categories except autos and
steel declined in the second quarter (see table below). Imports of
industrial materials, particularly nonferrous metals, continued the
downturn that began in the fourth quarter of last year. The 10 per
cent drop in the price of imported copper from the first to the second
quarter also contributed to this decline. Iron and steel imports,
however, recovered from the first quarter low to about the high level
of the second half of 1966.

Purchases of imported capital equipment fell as the pace of
domestic investment outlays slowed. The long-term growth in imports
of nonfood consumer goods (excluding passenger cars) was also arrested
in the second quarter.

Bank credit. The shift from a modest drop (adjusted) in bank-
reported claims in the first quarter to an increase of more than $100
million in the second reflected very heavy use by Japan of U.S.
acceptance credits. For the quarter, net extensions of short-term
bank loans and acceptance credits to Japan amounted to $230 million (unadj.),
a rate matched in the past only during peak periods of Japanese
borrowing. In addition, there were moderate net outflows of such
credits to LDC's in Asia and Latin America, but net outflows to
other developed countries were negligible.

IV -5
Partly offsetting these extensions of short-term credits
were further net repayments of outstanding term loans by industrial
countries. (Recent data on new long-term loan commitments by U.S.
banks suggests that repayments and amortizations may continue to
exceed gross disbursements on new long-term credits in coming months.)
In June, outstanding term loans in portfolios of U.S. banks were
reduced by $140 million as a result of sales to foreign affiliates,
in part under repurchase agreements.
Securities transactions. Foreign transactions in U.S.
corporate stocks resulted in an unusually large inflow of $140 mil-
lion in the second quarter, nearly half of which came in June. This
reflected a drop in net liquidations of U.K. holdings, and net purchases
of nearly $150 million by other countries (including nearly $90 million
from Canada) compared to about $50 million in the first quarter.
The net outflow on new foreign bond issues rose in the
second quarter, reflecting a continued high rate of borrowing by
Canada, and increases in offerings by the IBRD and Israel. For the
first half, sales of new foreign bonds in the U.S. market amounted
to more than $700 million, compared to $1.2 billion per year in 1965
and 1966.
New issues by Canada, Israel and international organizations
have accounted for almost all U.S. outflow on new security issues
this year. Some countries which in previous years concentrated
their borrowings in the U.S. market, including Mexico whose borrowings
are not subject to the IET, appear to have shifted much or all of

IV -6
their borrowing to the Euro-bond market. About $1 billion of new
issues was offered in the Euro-bond market in the first half of 1967,
up about 50 per cent from the first half of last year. The sharpest
growth was in issues by European borrowers (including $80 million of
issues by France), which accounted for more than half of the total;
affiliates of U.S. companies borrowed somewhat less than in the first
half of 1966, while other non-European issues rose substantially.
Despite the large volume of Euro-bond issues this year,
borrowing costs appear to have risen less than rates in the United
States, and for at least some foreign borrowers costs of issues
abroad are probably closely competitive with what would have to be
paid in this country (excluding the IET.)
Official reserve transactions. On the basis of official
reserve transactions, the payments position was in deficit by $880
million (seasonally adjusted) in the second quarter, following a
deficit of $1.8 billion in the first. After April the geographical
counterparts to the U.S. deficit shifted as the heavy inflows into
sterling halted and the pound came under pressure. Reflecting shifts
by foreigners out of sterling and D-marks into Euro-dollar investments,
the (unadjusted) U.S. balance on official settlements improved rapidly
after April, and in June it was in surplus. The appearance of a
sizable counterpart to our second quarter deficit in the reserve
gains of Western Europe after April reflected in part seasonal flows
into some countries as well as shifts of private funds from sterling and
purchases of foreign currencies by the U.K. for use in repaying part

IV -7
of its IMF drawing. In the second quarter, the U.S. deficit continued
to have a substantial counterpart in reserve gains by Latin America
and Asia. Additional details on reserve changes appear in the following
section.

IV -8
Payments balances of other countries
Outside the United States, the main balance of payments
developments in recent months have been the renewed deterioration
in the position of the United Kingdom; continuation of Continental
European surpluses, concentrated mainly in Germany; and some worsening
in the payments position of Japan. Large short-term dollar placements
abroad by German commercial banks have prevented the emergence of
official German reserve gains. Similarly, heavy foreign borrowing
by Japanese banks has prevented Japanese reserves from declining
much. There has been a marked leveling off in world trade, with
uneven effects among individual countries.
In the United Kingdom, there was a sharp reversal from
large official reserve gains (adjusted for repayment of short-term
assistance) in the first quarter to losses (similarly adjusted) in
the second quarter. A further reserve loss of $42 million was
announced for July, and the market assumes that there would have
been a much larger loss if Britain had not received assistance from
foreign central banks.
A large part of the shift from earlier reserve gains to
recent losses has reflected changes in short-term capital flows which
have resulted both from changing interest-rate differentials and from
changing market attitudes towards sterling prospects. But in addition,
the basic balance on current and long-term capital account has dete-
riorated. This balance had been in surplus during the fourth quarter

IV 9
of 1966 and the first quarter of 1967 but is thought to have
reverted to deficit since then. The merchandise trade deficit,
seasonally adjusted, increased from $53 million in the first
quarter to over $280 million in the second, as imports increased
unexpectedly--despite an absence of recovery in domestic activity--
while exports declined, reflecting reduced demand from Continental
Europe and the United States. The high level of imports has raised
new questions about the competitiveness of British goods at present
exchange rates. In June, the Middle Eastern crisis and the closing
of the Suez Canal created additional difficulties for the United
Kingdom by increasing the cost of oil imports and shipping, hampering
exports, and stimulating shifts of funds out of sterling. Most
analysts now assume that Britain can not achieve a significant basic
payments surplus this year as had earlier been hoped.
Continental European countries as a group continued to
run a substantial payments surplus during the first half of 1967,
and also in July. It will be seen from the table that the combined
surpluses of Common Market (EEC) countries, as measured by changes
in net official reserves plus net external assets of commercial banks,
increased substantially from less than $400 million in the second
half of 1966 to around $1 billion in the first half of 1967.
(Seasonal adjustments would change the pattern for Italy and France,
but would not greatly change the totals.)

IV -11
The surplus has been concentrated in Germany. This Con-
centration reflects the German recession, which has greatly depressed
German imports and consequently its partner countries' exports. Re-
cently, the decline in German imports has leveled off, but meanwhile
the effects of the earlier decline on other countries has come full
circle to produce a leveling off also in German exports. Hence, the
trade balance remained at a record $4-1/2 billion annual rate in the
second quarter.
The German payments surplus has not been reflected in any
substantial addition to official reserves. Instead, a large volume
of funds has been placed abroad by German commercial banks (and Ger-
man businesses have repaid earlier foreign borrowings) as German
short-term interest rates have been below those in foreign centers.
In July, the Bundesbank attempted to limit such outflows by increas-
ing the exchange risk, so that more of the effect of domestic credit
easing could be felt at home; the exchange rate was allowed to de-
cline and the spread between the Bank's buying and selling rate was
substantially widened.
The payments positions of France and Italy no longer show
the substantial surpluses of a year ago. But after seasonal adjust-
ment, both are probably still somewhat in surplus, despite the dampen-
ing effect of the German recession. French policy has deliberately
sought to avoid a deficit, by maintaining interest rates high relative
to other European countries despite a domestic slowdown, and by

IV -12
substantial borrowing in the Euro-dollar bond market on the part of
French nationalized industries. French reserves increased by $41
million in July. In Italy, unlike France, domestic activity has
continued to expand vigorously, but the payments balance has been
sustained by a surprisingly strong and continuing advance in total
exports.
For both Belgium and the Netherlands, the payments position
is stronger than a year ago. Recession in other countries has hurt
exports, but imports have leveled off in the Netherlands and declined
in Belgium as domestic demand has softened.
Swiss official reserves declined much less than seasonally
during the first half of 1967; massive inflows of funds occurred
during late May and early June as war clouds gathered and broke in
the Middle East. On July 10, the Swiss National Bank reduced its
discount rate from 3-1/2 to 3 per cent, partly in an effort to re-
duce the attractiveness to foreigners of investment in Switzerland.
While the inflows subsided after early June, there has so far been
no indication of any significant outflow, and perhaps none should
be expected while uncertainties about sterling and about the Middle
East persist.
Elsewhere in Europe, Spain has continued to lose reserves
rapidly, and some other countries have had moderate deficits.
Outside Europe, the payments position of Japan has weakened
as exports have leveled off while imports have continued to advance

IV -13
in line with the domestic expansion. Substantial reserve losses
have so far been avoided. Instead, the commercial banks, which
were repaying foreign debt last year, have this year been borrow-
ing substantial sums, mainly in the United States. The growing
danger of a further payments deterioration and of the emergence
of excessive domestic demand pressures is beginning to tilt mone-
tary policy in the direction of restraint.
Canadian reserves have declined further this year, but
this has been partly the result of deliberate Canadian policy, in
line with the agreement with the United States to avoid reserve
increases. Inflows of long-term capital have continued large,
though not as large as in early 1966 when there was a surge of
new Canadian issues in New York that had been held over from
1965.
The reserves of less developed countries as a group
continued to increase rapidly during the first half of 1967.
Most of the increase for Latin America accrued to Argentina in
the wake of its March devaluation and as a result of borrowing
from U.S. and foreign banks. Oil producing countries in the
Middle East and Africa continued to gain reserves through mid-
year, and so did a number of countries in Asia.

APPENDIX A: REVISIONS IN THE MONEY SUPPLY, TIME DEPOSIT, MEMBER BANK
RESERVE AND CREDIT PROXY SERIES*
The daily average money supply and all commercial bank time
deposits series (both weekly and monthly) have been revised to reflect
call report benchmark adjustments and changes in seasonal factors.
These revisions will be released in the August Bulletin. Seasonal
factors for member bank reserves and deposits also have been adjusted
to reflect the availability of one year of additional data since the
last review. Also, the reserve aggregates series (total, required
and nonborrowed reserves) have been revised back to 1947 so as to
make the level of the series consistant with the reduction of required
reserves against savings deposits, and other time deposits under $5
million, effective last March. 1/ Other than the reserve aggregate
series, the revisions do not go back before 1964 although some minor
adjustments were made in a few seasonal factors back to 1960. The former
and new seasonal factors for 1966 and 1967 for credit proxy, money
supply and nonborrowed reserves are shown in Table I. Seasonally ad-
justed and not seasonally adjusted data on a revised basis for the
various series are shown in the attached tables.
Table II which shows annual rates of change for both the
former and revised series provides a comparison of the effects of
the revision.
Credit Proxy
As shown in Table II the revision of the credit proxy
monthly seasonal factors had no effect on the annual and semiannual
growth rates, but the quarterly pattern in the last half of 1966 was
revised slightly. On the new basis the credit proxy shows a faster
rate of growth in the third quarter of 1966 than the old series.
The former and revised seasonally adjusted weekly credit
proxy series are shown in Chart I. The changes shown are associated
mainly with new patterns of financial flows as corporations adjust to
accelerated corporate tax payments and withholdings of employee taxes.
As the chart shows, the month most affected by the revision was
April. The seasonally adjusted level of the credit proxy was reduced
by about $700 million in April 1966 and $800 million in 1967. July
also showed decreases but they were smaller, about $300 million.
Offsetting these reductions were revisions in the seasonal factors
which raised the level of the credit proxy by about $300 million in
each of the months of February, August, September, and November.

Money Supply
The principal effects of revision of the money supply
series are to smooth the monthly and weekly fluctuations in the
seasonally adjusted data somewhat and after 1965, to increase the
average level. The effects of changes in seasonal factors are most
noticeable in the weekly money supply series during the past year,
as may be seen from Chart II. In general, the seasonally adjusted
money supply has been lowered in the months when corporate income
tax payments are due and the level has been raised in months
surrounding these tax payments. Benchmark adjustments reduced the
estimated level of nonmember bank demand deposits in the first half
of 1966 and 1967. However, these reductions were more than offset
by the increase in nonmember deposits in the last half of 1966.
Net, the effects of the benchmark and seasonal revisions
increased the overall money supply growth rate in 1966, with little
change in the first half and a smaller decline shown in the last
half. The first half of 1967 shows about the same rate of growth as
on the old basis.
Also shown in Chart II are the weekly seasonally adjusted
demand deposit component of the money supply and U.S. Government
demand deposits of member banks on the former and revised basis. As
has been noted before, there is a strong inverse relationship between
U.S. Government demand deposits and private demand deposits. The
revision of seasonal factors tended to reduce some of the irregularity
of both series. Thus, the new seasonal factors have attempted to
catch some of the changing seasonal pattern which are associated
with the changing tax payment patterns. Some of these tax payments
are now shifted completely to the new schedule, while others will
c ntinue to change for at least another year. However, the seasonal
estimated fr'm actual changes in the series during the period of
acceleration of corporate tax payments may not be representative of
the seasonal patterns that will apply when the acceleration phase
is passed.
Time Deposits
Benchmark data for time deposits reveal that nonmember time
deposits have been growing at a somewhat faster rate than estimated
earlier. The difference between nonmember time deposits based on the
new benchmark data was about $700 million in June 1967. Thus, the
June 1967 level of all commercial time deposits was raised by this
amount and comparable revisions, estimated by interpolation, were
made for each month back to December 1965.

While some of the monthly seasonal ractors were changed,
the effects of these were minor. The seasonal factors for March,
April, May, and October were reduced slightly while January, February,
August, and September factors were raised. The net effect of the
revisions was to raise the annual rate of growth of time deposits in
1966 from 8.4 per cent to 8.8 per cent, with about equal increases in
the first and second half of the year. For the first half of 1967,
the rate of growth was a little more than 17 per cent, about the same
as estimated earlier.
Reserve Aggregates
Data on total reserves, required reserves, and nonborrowed
reserves have been revised to reflect the change in required reserves
held against time deposits announced by the Board in March of this year.
Thus, the new reserve aggregates series reflect percentage reserve
requirements effective since March 1967. The effect of this adjustment
was to reduce the seasonally unadjusted level of each series by about
$850 million in March 1967. Data for months prior to March also
have been adjusted to reflect these new requirements in order to
eliminate the effects of changes in percentage requirements from the
series.
Nonborrowed reserves are shown in Table II, as an example
of the effects of the revisions of seasonal factors on the reserve
aggregate series. As the table shows, the revisions in nonborrowed
reserve seasonal factors were minor and had little effect on
annual rates of change. In general, the other reserve aggregate
series show the same patterns as nonborrowed reserves.
