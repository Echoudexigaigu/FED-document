of Governors of the Federal Reserve Syst em.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization proce ss which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain.

format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to rem ove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing).

first created electronic text from the document im age.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, 
staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.  Pl ease note that the numbers and text in charts and

SUlMARY AND OUTLOOK
Outlook for economic activity
Economic activity continues to strengthen. We are still
projecting the increase in GNP this quarter to be much larger than
in the second quarter when the continued drop in inventory accumulation
was still exerting a considerable down drag. Assuming no tax increase
effective before the end of the year, the fourth quarter rise is
likely to be even larger. After allowing for sharper price increases,
the rise in real GNP could be at an annual rate of over 6 per cent in
the final quarter. The auto strike has introduced a new dimension
of uncertainty into the outlook, If settled before the end of October,
however, and if work-stoppages are limited to one producer at a time
the impact on GNP would be relatively small in either the third or
fourth quarters.
Recent evidence of expansive strength includes further increases
in industrial output, employment and retail sales and a further decline
in unemployment. While manufacturer's new orders declined in July,
after several months of rise, most of the drop was in the highly
volatile aircraft sector; order backlogs in manufacturing increased
further. Personal income has been rising at a considerably faster
rate than in the first half year, reflecting sharper gains in
employment and wage rates. In view of the rise in income, a generous
expansion in consumer spending seems likely in the coming quarter. A
drop in the rate of new car sales in August was attributed by the
industry largely to inadequate stocks of 1967 models. Spending
for household durables is beginning to rise and the introduction

I-2
of new model cars also seems likely to give a fillip to consumer
outlays.
Despite the recent survey affirming that business capital
outlays will be rising only modestly over the balance of the year,
final sales will continue to be strongly supported by further
advances in defense expenditures. The recent rate of housing starts
and the volume of forward commitments seem to guarantee continued
increase in construction expenditures for the rest of the year. More-
over, if the auto strike is not too prolonged, accumulation of
inventories should be underway before year-end.
Outlook for resource use and prices
Industrial production in August apparently continued to rise
at about the July rate--recouping, in the two months, half of the
moderate downdrift over the first six months of the year. The
production rise from June to August (0.6 per cent a month) about kept
pace with the estimated rise in capacity and the rate of manufacturing
capacity utilization stabilized at 84 per cent.
The strike now underway in the auto industry, of course, will
act as a depressant on industrial activity until settled, while the
subsequent "make-up" for strike losses will stimulate a sharp gain in
the over-all index. By year-end, given our over-all demand projection,
we are estimating that industrial production will be up at about 3 per
cent from August and the rate of manufacturing utilization will rise
to 85 or 86 per cent, still well below the peak rates reached in 1966.

I-3
The acceleration in industrial output now foreseen over
the last half of the year, coupled with continued expansion in the
construction, service, and government sectors, should lead to a
rapid pace of growth in nonfarm employment and a tighter labor
market in the fourth quarter. But, in contrast to earlier this year,
the labor force has grown briskly in the past few months and further
increases should permit a large employment increase with only a small
further decline in unemployment. Continued strong pressure on wages
is likely, but rising productivity associated with the pick-up in
real output will act as a countervailing influence on unit labor
costs.
Price increases for industrial commodities have been
widespread since mid-July. The unusual concentration of price increases
announced over the past two months represent a major effort to catch
up on cost increases at a time when demands have begun to strengthen.
Given demand prospects as we now see them, industrial prices are
likely to continue to move upward, although the pace of advance may
moderate if the rise in unit labor costs slows with resumption of
large productivity gains. The recent weakening in farm prices and
prospects for increased supplies may serve to temper further increases
in consumer prices.
Capital markets outlook
While some areas of the capital market may be subject to
pressure over the next few weeks, a marked increase in long-term
rates does not appear likely, and some reduction in yields, especially

I-4
on U.S. Government and corporate issues, cannot be'ruled out. Unsold
corporate and municipal securities currently in dealer positions do
not appear unmanageable. Moreover, U.S. Government security dealers'
holdings of long-term Government securities remain near minimal levels,
and there is little evidence of strong investor desires to sell such
securities. The recent Treasury financing involving a 3-1/2 year
note resulted in an upward yield adjustment in the intermediate area
but these securities appear to be in relatively firm hands, and
dealer positions are not unusually large,
In August, corporate and municipal bond yields advanced to
levels near or exceeding the peaks reached earlier in the summer, with
the upward yield pressure stemming mostly from the continued heavy
security offerings from private borrowers and the Federal Government.
Yields have declined somewhat recently in the corporate bond market,
however, as the volume of such new issues in September is running below
the summer level. But even so, the September calendar is relatively
large.
Current credit demand pressures appear relatively most
persistent in the municipal market. In contrast to the corporate market,
the new issue volume of state and local government bonds in September
is estimated to be substantially greater than in July and August.
Moreover, there has been a slackening in institutional demand for such
securities over recent months.

I 5
Mortgage yields have adjusted upwards since spring, in
response to developments in other sectors of the capital market,
but upward pressures moderated in recent months as net savings
inflows to major lenders in the market continued at relatively high
levels.
Outlook for banking
Most economic factors suggest only moderate business loan
demands this fall. The impact of accelerated tax payments is largely
past for now. And with the forward thrust of GNP in the final months
of the year expected to be centered on consumption, residential
construction, and Government outlays--and only to a relatively minor
extent on business inventories and fixed investment--there is little
reason to expect a surge in business demands for short-term funds.
With respect to the auto strike, a limited work stoppage of the scope
presently assumed is likely to be quite minor in its effect on bank
credit demands, probably tempering business loans to auto suppliers,
loans to finance companies, and consumer credit.
The large inflows of negotiable CD's and Euro-dollars to
banks since midyear has probably been mainly related to bankers'
preparation for fall loan demands. Thus, if these demands do not come
up to banker expectations, banks are likely to become less active
in these markets. The weakness in business loans during recent weeks
has apparently caused some major banks to reappraise at least their

I -6
immediate needs for funds, and rates paid on short-term CD's have
edged downwards. Banks are likely to continue receiving sizable
inflow of other time and savings deposits, as market interest rates
are not expected to be under renewed upward pressure in the period
immediately ahead,
Demand deposits may be only a minor source of funds to
banks over the coming weeks. U.S. Government deposits may rise some
on average, reflecting the effect of tax collection after mid-September,
while private demand deposits may remain about unchanged,

I -7
Balance of payments
The liquidity deficit appears to have been at a somewhat
lower rate in July-August than in the first half year--perhaps $1-3/4
billion annual rate instead of $2-1/4 billion--even though receipts
from special transactions were smaller. However, there is no evidence
to suggest that the improvement will be maintained. Some of the improve-
ment may reflect net flows out of sterling into dollars that are not
directly measurable and will show up instead--as during the summer of
1966--as part of errors and omissions.
On the official reserve transactions basis, there was a sub-
stantial surplus in July-August. Most of the difference between the
two measures stems from an increase of nearly $1 billion between
June 30 and August 30 in the liabilities of U. S. banks to their
foreign branches. Euro-dollar deposit rates during this period were
unusually low relative co rates offered by U. S. banks on domestic CD's.
Hence the U. S. banks were willing to absorb an increasing supply of
Euro-dollar deposits and did not have to bid aggressively to obtain
them. Meanwhile, Euro-dollar rates have appeared attractive to foreign
investors relative to yields on money market instruments denominated in
sterling and in most Continental European currencies. This explains
the large supply of Euro-dollar deposits, which has doubtless been
augmented by market uncertainties about the prospects for sterling.
The U. S. merchandise trade balance remained in July at the
$3.9 billion annual rate of June, well below the April-May rate.
Exports were little changed; a bulge in petroleum shipments was about

I-8
matched by a drop in exports to Arab countries. Imports failed to
show the hoped-for decline. Slack demand in Europe has held exports
down and may also have helped to sustain imports by producing more
vigorous European efforts to sell here. Probably no significant
improvement in the trade balance is to be expected until Europe--
and especially Germany--experiences a decisive economic upturn, and
the available evidence suggests that that may not come for several
months. Meanwhile, the trade balance could worsen if vigorous domes-
tic expansion leads to a renewed expansion of imports.
Information on recent capital movements is very incomplete,
with data on direct investments in the second quarter not yet
available. Outstanding U.S. bank credit to foreigners declined in
July, as would be expected on seasonal grounds. U.S. purchases of
foreign securities were relatively large, but sales to foreigners
of U.S. corporate stocks, and of bonds intended to finance direct
foreign investments, were also sizable.

THE ECONOMIC PICTURE IN DETAIL
The Nonfinancial Scene
Gross national product. The assumptions underlying the staff
projections of GNP have been modified in two major respects from those
of last month: we have assumed that no surcharge on personal taxes will
be effective before the end of the year, rather than on October 1, and
the effects of the automobile strike on consumption and inventories in
both the third and fourth quarters have been more explicitly taken into
account.
The effects of the auto strike on GNP, under our assumptions,
are rather small. We have assumed that the strike will be confined
largely to the Ford Motor Company, that full operations in the industry
will be resumed before the end of October and that shut-downs in the
other companies, if any, will be of short duration. Since much of the
impact of the strike under these assumptions takes place in the third
quarter, the effects on production and sales in the fourth quarter
should be limited. Obviously, if lengthy strikes also affect GM and
Chrysler, the effects on GNP in the fourth quarter would be more
damaging.
On the other hand, the assumed postponement of the effective
date of the surcharge on personal taxes has a substantial impact in
raising fourth quarter gross national product both in current and con-
stant dollars, not to mention the probable ensuing carry-over effects
on the economy. Besides raising the real growth rate to a clearly unsus-
tainable pace, it would likely reinforce existing wage-price pressures.

II -2
Our current GNP projection has slightly larger gains in the
third quarter in both current and constant dollars than the previous
projection. Real GNP is now projected to grow at an annual rate of
over 4-1/2 per cent.
Although auto sales have weakened recently, largely as a
result of inadequate inventories, there have been compensating increases
in other expenditures. For example, sales of appliances and furniture
have shown greater strength than anticipated. Outlays for residential
construction in the third quarter are also expected to rise more
sharply than projected previously, partly as a result of the effects
of data revisions.
In contrast, the projection for the fourth quarter has been
modified substantially, largely because of the assumed deferral of the
tax increase. GNP is now assumed to increase at an annual rate of
$20 billion--$5 billion above our previous estimate. The annual rate
of real growth is over 6 per cent, even though the GNP deflator is
expected to rise at an annual rate of 3.7 per cent from the third to
fourth quarters.
About half of the rise in the GNP from the third to the
fourth quarter is in consumer spending for goods and services. This large
advance stems mainly from accelerated gains in personal income. A
rather high rate of auto purchases is projected, arising partly from
deferred demand. The growth in the consumer sector next quarter is
supplemented by a further large increase in government spending, a
moderate rise in residential construction outlays, and a switch from
inventory decumulation to some inventory rebuilding.

II -3
Personal income is rising rapidly, reflecting both sizable
employment gains and a stepped-up pace of increase in wage rates. The
workweek in manufacturing has also lengthened somewhat in recent months.
Under these conditions, a steady rise has been occurring in retail
sales. Thus, weekly retail sales data suggest a sizable advance in
spending for nondurable goods in August. On the other hand, as a
result of the sharp drop in the rate of auto sales in August and a
possible decline in September because of the auto strike, we-are esti-
mating domestic sales of 7.5 million units, annual rate, in the present
quarter, down from 7.8 million in the second quarter. In the rebound,
about 8.2 million, perhaps more, new cars are expected to be sold in
the fourth quarter, and at higher prices. This, along with further
expansion in sales of other consumer durable goods, results in a
projection of a sizable rise in consumer durable goods sales (about
$2.5 billion, annual rate).
The substantial rise in consumer spending normally
would be expected to be associated with a drop in the rate of consumer
saving. However, owing to the prospective sharp rise in income in the
fourth quarter, the saving rate is maintained at about 6.7 per cent,
making for an unusually high rate for over a year.
Defense spending continues to be a strong expansionary force.
Orders have been sustained at high levels and a military pay raise of
over $1 billion seems likely in the fourth quarter. The recent request
for a $4 billion supplemental appropriation for Vietnam costs has not
allayed the suspicion that January may see yet another request to spend

II -4
more, although obviously major uncertainties remain in this area. The
projected increases in defense outlays of'about $2.5 billion a quarter
are consistent with the Budget plus the supplemental of $4 billion; it
should be stressed, however, that this implies a marked slowing of the
rise in military outlays in the first half of 1968.
Federal non-defense purchases are moving up faster than
expected, largely because of CCC outlays. The expected Federal pay
raise for civilian workers will also add to outlays in the fourth
quarter. In the State and local sector, wage rates and employment are
both rising rapidly, contributing to a steady rise in outlays.
Residential construction activity has risen substantially in
this quarter as the higher rate of starts in the first half of the year
has been translated into activity. New home starts are also rising
from an annual rate translated into activity. New home starts are also
rising from an annual rate of 1.2 million units in the second quarter
to about 1.3 million in the present quarter, judging from advance
commitments, permits, and July data. Multifamily starts, which have
been lagging, are beginning to show more strength, and the unsold
inventory of new homes is low. A further moderate rise in residential
construction activity in the fourth quarter seems assured both by the
third quarter increase in starts and by the assumed higher level of
starts in the fourth quarter. This prospect seems likely despite high
mortgage rates, and recent uncertainty in financial markets.
The downward drag on GNP from the inventory adjustment is no longer
expected to be an important factor limiting growth. Although manufacturer's
inventories are still high relative to sales, excessive stocks are expected

II -5
to be briight into more sustainable relationships to sales by increases
in shipments rather than by further production cuts. In fact, dis-
tributor's stocks, which are no longer high, could be drawn down unin-
tentionally and temporarily by any sharp and unexpected increase in
sales, although this possibility has not been incorporated in our
projection. In fact, apart from autos, we assume only small offsetting
changes in inventories in this quarter.
The outlook for automobile stocks is difficult to assess.
Because of the early changeover to 1968 models, the build-up of new
models in dealers' show rooms has thus far been larger than ususal but,
with the strike now underway, this advantage may be reversed by the end
of the month. Meanwhile, stocks of 1967 model cars have been run down
to very low levels. The net inventory decumulation attributable to
autos may be $1 billion or more in this quarter. In the fourth quarter,
the projection incorporates the resumption of intended net inventory
accumulation on a modest scale, even though auto stocks may show a
smaller than seasonal rise as sales are stimulated by deferred demands.
The expectation that business plant and equipment expenditures
will remain essentially on a high plateau this year has been supported
by the results of the most recent survey of investment intentions by
Commerce-SEC. This survey indicates that outlays for this year as a
whole will be slightly below those predicted earlier, with a small rise
in the second half of the year. Increased business purchases of autos in
the fourth quarter and a further rise in farm equipment outlays and private
institutional building, account for the larger rise in fixed investment
in the projection than in the plant and equipment survey,

Industrial production. Industrial production is estimated
to have increased again about one point or more in August from the
preliminary July level of 156.3. At an estimated 157.3, the total
index would be one per cent below the December peak and up one per
cent from the June low.
Auto assemblies in August, after allowance for the early
and relatively short model changeover period, rose about 3 per cent.
If the strike against Ford is not settled before the end of September,
the direct loss in the total index will be slightly over 1 point.
(A strike against GM would have resulted in a direct loss of about
2 points in the total index.)
Among other consumer goods, output of television sets rose
sharply in August partially in response to the reduction in inven-
tories by the month-long RCA strike and partially because of the
introduction of new models. Output of some household appliances,
however, apparently declined further.
Preliminary data indicate a rise in production of nonelectri-
cal machinery but a decline in electrical equipment. Output of
commercial and military aircraft and defense equipment increased further.
Output of iron and steel, reflecting mainly demands from
the auto industry, increased. (When the figures are in, it may be
necessary to adjust the seasonal factors to allow for the impact of
the early auto model changeover on steel production.) Output of
nonferrous metals declined further in August as the copper strike
continued. Production of crude oil rose 3.5 per cent further follow-
ing an 8 per cent increase from June to July.

II -9
Despite the increases in the total index in July and prob-
ably in August, it is still not certain that an upward trend in
industrial production has set in. Output in some industries has
declined further and in others has shown little or no improvement.
Recent increases in production of some products such as autos,
television sets, and crude oil, have been in response to special
supply stiuations and not necessarily toa broad upswing in demand.
Retail inventories, however are no longer excessive and sales have
increased substantially in the last three months. If this improve-
ment continues it will undoubtedly be reflected in a broadening
increase in production.
Manufacturing utilization rate. The July rate of manu-
facturing capacity utilization remained unchanged from the June level
of 83.9 per cent. An increase in the operating rate of the advanced
product sector was offset by a further decline in the primary products
industries. Prior to July the operating rate had fallen steadily
from a peak of 91.0 per cent in June of last year. The utilization
rate for August is expected to be little changed from July.

Unit auto sales and inventories. Sales of new domestic
automobiles in August were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
7.5 million units, compared with 8,4 million in July. The stock of
new autos (including unintroduced 1968 models) dropped one-fifth
during August and was 13 per cent below last year.
The sharp drop in sales of new cars has been caused by supply
shortages, according to industry sources. The table below gives the
salable stock (new unintroduced models subtracted from total stock
figures) for July and August since 1964, The figures show that stocks
at the beginning of this August were considerably below 1965 and 1966,
when inventories were high, but were only a little smaller than in
August 1964.

August 20 874 1,147 1,170 859
August 31 683 932 951 669
The scheduled introduction dates for new autos begin
September 14 with Chrysler, followed by General Motors on September 21,
Ford on September 22, and American Motors on September 26. These
dates average about 10 days earlier than last year.

II -11
Used car sales eased slightly in the firbt 20 days of August
from last month and were off about one-tenth from a year ago. The
stock of used cars dropped 5 per cent during the 20 days but remained
at the year ago level. Prices of used cars reported in the CPI
increased almost 2 per cent from June to July.
Sales of imported cars in the first six months were up 15
per cent from last year but are expected to slow somewhat in the
second half. For the year, the import share of the auto market is
expected to rise to 9 per cent from 8 per cent last year.
Consumer credit. Expansion in outstanding consumer instal-
ment credit, which had spurted in June, fell back somewhat in July.
The July increase, however, was still larger than in either of the late
spring months.
The slackened rate of expansion was evident for all major
types of credit, but experience varied amont institutions. Commercial
bank credit was well maintained, not only through regular activities
but also through the expanding use of credit card, check-credit and
other special facilities.
In the automobile market in July, commercial banks placed
customary emphasis on direct lending to purchasers prior to new model
introduction. Finance companies, on the other hand, experienced more
than the usual reduction in auto credit holdings, One contributing
factor here has been the change in relative importance of the credit
buyer at the end of this model year. Last year, price concessions
attributable to heavy inventories brought marginal buyers into the
credit market near the end of the model year. In contrast, the

II -12
inventory situation this year has not produced the same buyers'
market, Thus, credit purchases have been relatively less important
and the average note per car has not increased as it did at this time
last year.

Residential construction. Seasonally adjusted private housing
starts, which had edged off in June, spurted upward again in July,
based on the recently reconstituted series now available from the
Census Bureau. Most of the rise in July stemmed from the extremely
volatile multifamily sector, however, and regionally most of that was
apparently concentrated in the Northeast, where starts soared to the
highest rate since late 1965.

1/ Seasonally adjusted annual rates; preliminary.
Because of the pause in permit activity shown in the table
the volatility of the starts series and other factors, the short-run
sustainability of the July rate of starts is open to question. Never-
theless, the strength displayed in July clearly points to the probability
of a better than 1.3 million annual rate of starts for the third
quarter as a whole. This would be in line with earlier expectations
and would compare with a rate of 1.2 million in the second quarter and
somewhat less than that in all of 1966. Further improvement--which
still seems a good possibility this year--will depend on the extent
to which the relatively advanced rate of multifamily starts can at
least be maintained and that for single family structures can be
raised further.

II -14
Although the basic demand potential for both types of
structures has continued to grow, only multifamily starts have thus
far even temporarily approached the average prevailing as recently
as 1965. While activity in single family starts has also risen
further, the pace has been slowed in part by renewed caution by
speculative builders in a situation where interest rate movements,
the return of steep discounts on Government-underwritten mortgages
and other factors, including rising building costs, have tended to
revive uncertainty about potential-buyer reactions in the market
for both new and existing properties over the period ahead. In June,
the latest month for which data are available, seasonally adjusted
inventories of new homes available for sale--including those under
construction--by speculative builders were still below their end-
of-1966 level, even though the rate of sales had advanced substantially.
As a result, the ratio of available stocks of houses to sales was
still one of the lowest in the history of the series, which began
in late 1962.
Business fixed investment. Business spending for new plant
and equipment will be nearly 2 per cent higher in the fourth quarter
of this year than in the second quarter, according to the Commerce-
SEC August survey of business plans. August plans indicate an
increase in spending for new plant and equipment in the current quarter
not much smaller than was planned in May ($1.0 billion as compared
$1.25 billion, annual rates) but a considerably smaller increase in
the following quarter ($.2 billion as compared with $.8 billion annual

II -15
rates). Outlays in the fourth quarter would be slightly less than
a year earlier. The August survey also confirms the small second
quarter decline in fixed capital outlays indicated in the May survey,
following the relatively large decline in the first quarter.
If August investment plans are realized, nonfarm business
fixed capital outlays this year would total $62.0 billion, 2.3 per
cent more than last year in terms of current prices. The May survey
had shown a rise of 2.9 per cent, and the February survey 3.9 per
cent. The 2.3 per cent increaee now indicated for 1967 compares with
increases of about 15 per cent or more in each of the three preceding
years.
Manufacturers have reduced planned outlays for the year by
2 per cent since May, with a downward revision in durable goods
industries of nearly 3 per cent. On the other hand, nonmanufacturing
businesses as a whole have raised their plansa trifle, with upward
revisions of around 3 per cent by railroads, other transportation in-
dustries and public utilities. Other nonmanufacturing industries have
reduced earlier plans.

The National Industrial Conference Board survey of second
quarter capital appropriations by the 1,000 largest manufacturers
indicates a 4 per cent decline in new approvals with a slightly larger
decline by durable goods producers. Capital expenditures exceeded
new appropriations by nearly 6 per cent (by more than 10 per cent
for nondurable goods firms) and backlogs of unspent appropriations
declined to the lowest level in more than a year (in more than eighteen
months for nondurable goods producers). Nevertheless, the second
quarter closing backlogs appear to be sufficient to support expenditures
at the second quarter rate well into next year.

II -17
New and unfilled orders. New orders received by manufacturers
were off 1.5 per cent in July from the June level. This downturn
followed five consecutive monthly increases. Durab.e goods orders
declined 3.6 per cent while nondurables were up 0.9 >er cent. Reductions
were concentrated in the aircraft, nonelectrical mac inery and fabricated
metal products industries. Almost all the decline in the total and
three-fourths of the decline in durables was accountec for by the
volatile aircraft sector, where orders were off 22 per cent. New
orders for the machinery and equipment grouping were do n 2.5 per
cent, following strong increases in each of the four prezious months.
Unfilled orders for manufactured goods were up 0.4 per cent.
This marked the third consecu ive monthly increase, but tie rise was
smaller than in the two previous months.
Business inventories. Following liquidation at a sizable
pace in June, total business inventories may have shown little change
or increased moderately in July. Manufacturers shifted from
liquidation totaling $190 million in June to accumulation of about
$275 million in July. According to confidential figures (still
preliminary) to be released next week, the book value of retail
inventories continued to decline in July, but by less than $100 million--
only a third as much as in June; auto stocks were reduced sharply
further but other durable goods lines and nondurable goods stores
showed some, partly offsetting,increases. Wholesale trade figures
are not yet available for July; in the preceding three months

II -18
Wholesale stocks declined (at an average of $135 million per month)
but these figures sometimes fluctuate abruptly and changes are
difficult to anticipate.
The July rise in factory stocks reflected an abrupt step-up
in accumulation in the durable goods sector--from a nominal $25 million
in June to $405 million in July. Inventory liquidation continued
in nondurable goods industries.
The significance of the sharp July spurt in durable goods
industries as the beginning of a longer run upward movement is debatable
because a very large part of the rise was accounted for by a shift in
the motor vehicle industry from liquidation totaling $100 million in
June to accumulation of almost $150 million in July. This sort of
June-July shift occurred in this industry in both 1966 and 1965, and
it appears to be a quasi-seasonal phenomenon associated with the
beginning, or approach, of the model changeover, which may not have
been completely taken into account in seasonal adjustment of the figures.
Nevertheless, apart from this auto industry development, the
rate of inventory accumulation was stepped up considerably in the
defense products industries--to the highest rate since last December.
This step-up followed a large increase in new orders and a renewed
rapid increase in unfilled orders during the first half of the year
following a period of stability in late 1966. As in the case of the
auto industry, the bulk of the July accumulation in defense industries
was apparently in work-in-process stocks.

II -19
Shipments by manufacturers edged up in July--with small
gains for both durable and nondurable goods industries--and the
stock-sales ratio was unchanged at 1.79, as compared with 1.65 a
year earlier.
Labor market. The employment situation showed general
firmness in August. Nonfarm payroll employment rose sharply, by
300,000, from July, but about half of the gain was due to a seasonal
employment pick-up in autos after the model changeover and the return
to work of striking rubber workers. As has been the case in most
recent months, significant employment increases were concentrated
in government--largely State and local--and in the private services.
However, the labor market remained fairly tight, and the unemployment
rate edged down by one-tenth of a point for the second successive
month, to 3.8 per cent.
The anticipated acceleration of output later this year will
make increasing demands on available manpower. With continued expansion
in services and government probable, along with the beginning of
recovery in manufacturing and increased construction activity, nonfarm
employment should show a rapid pace of growth for the rest of the year,
assuming an auto strike of only limited extent and duration. This
picture suggests a tighter labor market ahead, with unemployment
declining somewhat further in the fourth quarter.
Labor supply should be adequate to meet the increased demands,
for the time being at least. Some slack exists. Manufacturing

II -20
employment in August remained below its January peak, and unemployment
of blue collar workers (especially the less skilled) was somewhat
above the lowest levels of 1966. In addition, the workweek in
manufacturing remained some three quarters of an hour below a year
ago. In contrast to earlier this year, the labor force has grown
briskly in the past few months; the civilian labor force was up by
200,000 in August, and was 1.6 million above its level a year earlier.
The adult male labor force should grow at a more rapid rate, and the
armed forces should be absorbing fewer men. Since easing of demands
earlier this year had reduced the labor force participation of adult
women somewhat from late 1966, an acceleration of output could also
result in additional numbers entering the labor market. But the
outlook does suggest developing shortages of skilled labor by year-
end, and continued strong pressure on wages. Increased labor
compensation should be offset somewhat, however, by rising productivity
associated with the rapid recovery of real output.
Nonfarm employment. The nonfarm payroll employment figures
were subject to unusually large revisions this past month as the
regular monthly adjustment of preliminary data was augmented by the
annual revision of seasonals and adjustment to new benchmarks. (See
Appendix A). The result was to raise the nonfarm employment level
slightly, but to reduce what had been a 200,000 June-to-July increase
in total nonfarm employment to only 45,000. But with the August
increase of 300,000, the revised figures show that nonfarm jobs have

II -21
shown a large increase since May; in August, nonfarm employment was
600,000 above the May trough and 1.9 million above August 1966,
In manufacturing, employment rose by 185,000 in August, to
more than make up the 115,000 (revised) dip in July. Although the
increase reflected largely the seasonal recovery of employment in
autos after the model changeover (up 100,000) and the return from
strike of rubber workers (up 50,000), there were also smaller, but
significant employment gains in the electrical equipment and machinery
industries. Manufacturing employment as a whole, however, still
remains some 200,000 below the January peak, with most of the decline
in the primary and fabricated metals (partly the result of the copper
strike), and electrical equipment industries.
Strength has been evident in the manufacturing workweek
which, at 40.6 hours, is up three-tenths of an hour from the May-June
level; the rise in August was only one-tenth, but the workweek in
durable goods industries rose by three-tenths. The pick-up in
employment and hours combined to raise manufacturing manhours by 1-1/2
per cent in August. Increases in average hours were general among
durable goods industries, with rises of more than two-tenths in machinery,
transportation equipment (reflecting the model changeover in autos) and
in instruments. However, the workweek in manufacturing as a whole
remains well below its year-ago level of 41.4 hours.

II -22
Among nonmanufacturing industries, the August employment
changes continued the recent pattern of growth. The government (mainly
State and local) and service and finance sectors continued to dominate
the picture, with increases of about 40,000 and 80,000, respectively,
In addition, trade picked up with a 30,000 job gain. On the other
hand, contract construction dipped slightly, after rising by over
40,000 (revised) in July.
Earnings. The substantial wage settlements of recent months
are beginning to be reflected more clearly in the earnings figures.
Average hourly earnings of production workers in all private nonfarm
industries remained unchanged in August at $2.67, but they were 4.7
per cent above the August 1966 level. Despite reduced overtime at
premium pay, manufacturing hourly earnings--which showed no change
over the month--now average 4.4 per cent above August a year ago.
Hourly earnings were up more than 5 per cent over the year in every
major nonmanufacturing industry for which data are available.
Industrial relations. Negotiations in the automobile industry
dominate the industrial relations scene, and the possibility of an
extensive and protracted strike has raised serious questions concerning
the economic outlook for the remainder of this year. The over-all
impact of any walkout will depend, of course, both on which companies
are struck, and the length of the strikes. The UAW chose Ford as the
target company for negotiations and Ford workers went out on strike
September 7. If the 1964 experience is repeated other firms could
also face a walkout. Chrysler was the target company in the 1964

II -23
negotiations, and settled on national issues without a strike; on the
other hand, General Motors and Ford's production was severely affected
by strikes over local issues.
Union and management are now relatively far apart: the UAW
demand is for a wage and fringe package costing about 90-cents over
a three-year period, or over 6 per cent a year, not counting cost-of-
living adjustments; management has countered with a package estimated
at about 60-cents, or over 4 per cent. The companies' offer in general
meets many of the union's fringe demands and most of the difference
is in wages; (average hourly cost of wages and fringes combined is
estimated to be about $4.68).
The Union's basic wage demands appear to be generally in
line with recent wage settlements in manufacturing. The recently
negotiated rubber contract, which is viewed as something of a pattern
for autos, provided about 80-cents per hour over three years for most
rubber workers. These figures are not entirely comparable, however,
since the contracts in the rubber industry exclude cost-of-living
adjustments and about 15-cents of the settlement included a catch-up
for past price increases. The auto workers on the other hand have
received 11-cents extra in escalator adjustments in 1966 alone, and a
total of 18-cents under the past three-year contract, an average of
almost 2 per cent a year, in addition to the 2.8 per cent per year in
deferred wage increases. Thus, the companies argue, a lower wage
increase for the auto workers would be comparable, since they do not
have to "catch up" with rising prices.

II -24
A major problem in the current negotiations is the demand
for a substantial pay differential by skilled workers, who have been
given veto power over the contract. The companies have indicated their
willingness to bargain on this matter, but no specific amounts have
been mentioned so far. Granting a wage differential may not be too
costly to the companies, since skilled workers comprise less than a
fifth of the employment total, but the companies may be reluctant to
grant a substantial increase, because large differentials send to
create ptesuure for further wage adjustments.
In addition to the issue of wage rates, the negotiators face
a number of thorny issues that may hold up settlement; including the
UAW demand for a guaranteed monthly wage, a more generous supplemental
unemployment benefits (SUB) plan, equal pay for Canadian workers, and
increased pensions for retired as well as current workers, tied to the
consumer price index.
The companies have so far offered, in addition to wage increases,
to raise monthly pension benefits by 24 per cent, and to provide
additional medical and disability benefits. They will probably also
go along with an increase in SUB payments from 65 to 80 per cent of
wages--which was provided in the rubber contract. A management
proposal to limit the benefits from the cost of living escalator is
hardly likely to be received with favor by the UAW. Equal pay for
Canadian workers was not mentioned in the management proposal,

II -25
The UAW demands suggest an increased emphasis on wage rate
increases; nonwage items took priority in the 1964 settlement. The
attention to wages at this time reflects both the pressure of rising
consumer prices and the special concern for current income on the part
of the large number of young union members who have entered the
industry in the past several years of employment expansion. At
the same time, the Union has not given up its interest in improving
the position of older and retired workers, and in providing for
production workers some of the prerequisites and job security generally
associated with white collar employment.
Wholesale prices. The wholesale price index, which declined
from last September to April and then rose to July, declined again in
August according to the BLS preliminary estimate. Farm and food
prices declined nearly two per cent in August, reversing half the
run-up over the preceding three months, and the total wholesale
price index decreased 0.4 per cent despite a pronounced rise in prices
of industrial commodities. Fluctuations in the total index over the
past year--within a relatively moderate range around 106 per cent
of the 1957-59 average--have reflected primarily sharp movements in
prices of farm products and foods.

1/ Preliminary estimate.
The August increase in prices of industrial commodities represents
an abrupt break out of the pattern of stability prevailing from February
to mid-July and of relatively slow uptrend from mid-1966 to February.
As a preliminary estimate its amount may be somewhat suspect: the
advance July estimate of a 0.1 per cent rise in industrial prices did
not hold in the final figure, which was unchanged from June, With the
pricing date unusually late in August (the 15th) the sample was cut off
sooner than usual in making the August estimate. However, that an
appreciable increase in average wholesale prices of industrial commodities
occurred between July 11th (the July pricing date) and August 15th appears
amply confirmed by a proliferation of producer announcements of price
increases, which, moreover, showed little let-up in late August and
early September.
Since mid-July, price increases have been effected--or, in a
few cases, announced to be effective later this month or in October--
for crude petroleum and gasoline; copper scrap and some copper products;

II -27
steep scrap, tin-plate, steel plate and steel bars; lumber, plywood,
flat glass, gypsum products and various other building materials;
tires and other rubber products; silver, silverware, and photographic
film; carpet yarns and carpets; some television sets and appliances;
trucks and autos (in the form of suggested, or estimated, increases
in list prices for 1958 models--part of which may reflect quality
improvement); and metal working machinery.
The stability in average prices of industrial commodities
from February throughearly July (the latest date for which BLS
index components are available) resulted from an offset between a
downward drift in prices of industrial materials and a moderate rise
in prices of industrial products. The table below shows the progressive
slackening of the over-all industrial price increase after the period
of sharp rise in the first half of 1966, in terms of the behavior
of materials and products (the special FR groupings of BLS index
components):

Industrial Products 2.4 2.6 1,4
Consumer Nonfoods 1.7 2.1 1.4

II -28
Recent reported price increases, however, cover a wide array
6f industrial materials (lumber and other building materials, copper,
and various steel mill products) as well as industrial products; thus,
it seems likely that the apparent large increase in average prices of
industrial commodities since mid-July has reflected some reversal of
the earlier decline in material prices as well as a pick-up in the
rate of increase in prices of products.
The August increase in industrial prices estimated by the BLS
literally returns to the high rate of increase prevailing during the first
half of 1966, and, as suggested above, a further appreciable increase
is possible this month. The price increases of the past two months
reflect efforts to pass on cost increases accumulated over the past
year--including major wage settlements and freight rate increases--at
a time when business and consumer demands appear to be pulling out of
a protracted period of a slackness and despite relatively low current
rates of capacity utilization (as, e.g., in the steel industry).
Consumer prices. In July the Consumer Price Index rose 0.4
per cent, to 116.5 per cent of the 1957-59 average, as prices of foods,
other commodities, and services all increased further. The rise in
food prices, however, was apparently less than seasonal and if food
prices are included on a seasonally adjusted basis, the July increase
in the CPI would amount to only 0.2 per cent. According to the BLS,
July is the only month of the year in which there is a clear--or
measurable--seasonal component in the total index, throughout the rest
of the year seasonal fluctuations among individual commodities tend
to be roughly offsetting and without net effect on the total index.

II -29
After allowance for seasonal developments, then the sharp
run-up in food prices in May and June ended in July and the rise in
the total CPI was, if anything, somewhat less than in the two
preceding months. Given the uncertainties of measurement of seasonal
fluctuations during this period of unusual volability in farm
and food prices, it may be premature to declare the food price rise
over, but any rise over the last half from the June-July level now
appears likely to be small,
Retail prices of non-food commodities in July rose at about
the average rate of other recent months, with used car prices strenghtening
substantially again after a less than seasonal rise in June and with new
car prices edging up contrary to the decline expected near the end of
the model year. Prices of appliances and other household durables were
also reported up. Summer clearance sales brought a decline--but
apparently less than seasonal--in apparel prices,
From January to July 1967, average prices of non-food
commodities as measured in the CPI increased at an annual rate of
nearly 3-1/2 per cent, as compared with 2 per cent during 1966. The
bulk of this step-up resulted from an 11 per cent increase in used
car prices (triple the usual seasonal rise), bringing them in July
to the highest level since the initiation of this used car price series

II -30
in 1953. While used car prices are likely to remain high during the
current period of new car shortages, a further appreciable gain over
the last half of the year does not seem likely. Apart from used
cars, average retail prices of non-food commodities have been
increasing only moderately faster than in 1966, and while the
current step-up in price increases at wholesale may well be passed
through to retail prices, the gain in the CPI total non-food commodity
component in the last half does not seem likely to exceed the first
half (3-1/2 per cent) rate and may fall below it.
Price increases for services continued to be widespread
in July and, in part because of a reversal of the earlier downtrend
in mortgage interest rates, the service component of the CPI showed
some step-up from the 3.5 per cent annual rate of increase during
the first half of the year.

II -31
Farm production and price prospects. Farm output in 1967
bids to be the highest on record with both livestock and crop output
exceeding that of any other year. These prospects have varied impli-
cations for farm and food prices, mostly on the down side. On the
basis of August 1 conditions, crop output is expected to be 5 per cent
above last year and 2 per cent above 1965. Gross production of live-
stock is predicted to be a little higher than 1966, an estimate that
is probably too low. Although weather throughout August has been
soggy in the Southeast and very dry in the West, it has been favorable
for development of crops and pastures in the great central farming
areas.
Crops of food grains, feed grains, and soybeans promise to
be bigger than ever before but the cotton crop will be the smallest
since 1921. The 14 per cent larger food grain output, with rice up
3 per cent and wheat up 15 per cent, will be about equal to expected
1967-68 requirements: prices have drifted to a seventh below last
August. Record corn and sorghum grain crops and below-average oat and
barley crops total 174.5 million tons of feed grains, 11 per cent above
1966, and somewhat larger than utilization now in sight. However, lower
prices already in evidence may stimulate feeding of livestock and
encourage exports, as well. The soybean crop is 7 per cent larger than
last year and supplies for 1967-68 are 14 per cent larger. Prices will
probably average near the price-support loan level, a tenth below last
year, in the 1967-68 season. These large supplies will compensate for
sharply reduced crops of cottonseed and flaxseed.

II -32
The cotton crop of 8.3 million bales is 13 per cent below
1966, reflecting larger grower participation in the 1967 cotton program
and above average abandonment of planted acreage. This is the second
crop grown under the surplus-cutting cotton acreage diversion program.
A draft on stocks of 5 to 6 million bales, required to meet projected
1967-68 use, is expected to reduce August 1, 1968 carryover to 7 million
bales, 10 million below the peak of August 1, 1966. Off-color and short
staples are in surplus supply. Incipient shortages of longer staples
have prompted some mill-buying in the fields at prices a fifth or more
above the loan rate. The seasonal average prices of all grades is
expected to exceed the average loan rate.
Projected gross production of livestock and products is 1 per
cent larger than 1966, with meat animal and dairy products unchanged and
poultry and eggs up 5 per cent. The meat animal index, though it differs
in concept from slaughter data, is suspect for it is too much below other
meat output estimates to be attributed to conceptual differences alone.
Commercial meat production through August has been 8 per cent above last
year's low January-August production but the margin is expected to
narrow and disappear by the end of the year. For the year as a whole,
meat production is expected to average at least 3 to 4 per cent above
1966. Despite 8 per cent higher prices received for milk this year,
milk cow numbers have continued to decline and production has been
maintained by higher output per cow. Commercial utilization is down and
CCC purchases of dairy products to support prices so far in 1967 have
equalled 9 per cent of milk production. Purchases were negligible last
year.

II -33
Farm prices. Crop prices have been under downward pressure
as a result of large production in prospect and larger-than-expected
carryover stocks of grains and soybeans into the 1967-68 marketing
year. In mid-August, average prices of these crops were 15 per cent
under a year earlier, but August 1966 was the mid-point in our "feed-
the-world" speculative boom in grains and soybeans, a point often
ignored in farmers' complaints. August prices of grains and oilseed
had eased 3 per cent from July and further declines toward loan levels
are expected as harvest approaches. Supply prospects suggest that the
divergent trends in meat animal prices will continue, with cattle main-
taining the strength shown in recent weeks and hogs declining this fall,
although less than seasonally.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL SITUATION
Bank credit. Preliminary month-end estimates suggest that
credit at all commercial banks rose at an annual rate of about 10 per
cent in August, with acquisitions of new Treasury issues and the
financing of Government security dealer positions accounting for most
of the increase. Since midyear, bank credit has risen, on the basis
of preliminary estimates, by more than $10 billion, with acquisitions
of Treasury securities and dealer loans accounting for about three-
fifths of total loans and investments made by banks.

the last statement day of the month. Many of the largest commercial
banks apparently did not bid actively for the most recent new issue,
but country banks made sizable acquisitions. This difference in
behavior apparently reflects a greater premium placed on liquidity
recently by the larger banks. Indeed, while acquisitions of other
securities in August continued at the reduced pace that began in June,
New York City banks acquired only short-term issues, but other weekly
reporters acquired mainly issues longer than 1 year.
The table below shows annual rates of increase in bank credit
over a somewhat longer period. All measures of bank credit indicate a
more rapid rate of growth since midyear, reflecting Treasury financings.
As compared with the first half of 1967, the growth rate of holdings of
Governments was considerably higher, while banks reduced the rate at
which they acquired other securities, and the rate of increase of
business loans declined sharply with the diminution of accelerated tax
payments.

Businesses began to reduce outstanding bank loans in late
July, and during August it is estimated--on a preliminary basis--that
such loans at all banks declined by about $1 billion. This contraction
in business loans probably reflects, in large part, loan repayments in
August that had been delayed from July as the result of financing needs
related to acceleration of withholding tax payments. The August decline
in business loans reduced the average annual rate of growth of such
credit over July and August to about 1 to 2 per cent, and for the year
to date to about 9.0 per cent. Liquidation occurred in virtually every
industry category, and was particularly sharp for the machinery, textile,
petroleum, chemical and rubber, and mining industries--all of which had
been large borrowers earlier in the summer when accelerated tax payments
had been inflating loan demands.
Among other loan categories, those to finance companies
declined further while those to consumers continued to expand at a
modest rate. Real estate loans, on the other hand, showed some addi-
tional strength.
Bank deposits. Net inflows of time and savings deposits at
all commercial banks in August accelerated to an over 18 per cent annual
rate on a daily average basis. A large part of this growth reflected
an increase of almost $950 million in outstanding negotiable CD's (on
a month-end basis), bringing the total of net new issues of these
deposits since midyear to about $1.5 billion after essentially no growth
in the second quarter. The sharp increase in outstanding CD's reflects

III -4
not only the continued relative rate attractiveness of these instruments,
but also the increased supply of corporate funds seeking short-term
investment following essential completion of the program of corporate
income tax payment acceleration for the year while inflows from capital
market financings remained large.
At weekly reporting banks, inflows of other forms of interest-
bearing deposits--shown in the next table--also remained large, as has
been the case all summer. From fragmentary evidence--and adjusting for
the shift from passbook savings to time deposits in 1966--it does not
appear that inflows have been retarded to any noticeable extent by
either the increase in market yields since midyear or the recent new
issues of Treasury securities.

In addition to the large inflow of time deposits, banks
continued to acquire Euro-dollars at a rapid rate. Borrowing from
foreign branches increased by $600 million in August, bringing the
increase in such borrowing to $800 million since midyear. Reflecting
this increased supply of Euro-dollars along with the repayment of
business loans, weekly reporting banks--especially those in New York
and Chicago--became less aggressive in soliciting CD's late in August
and a few banks reported modest reductions in CD rates--mostly on
short-term issues.
The increased use of Euro-dollars reflects two major factors.
On the one hand, since mid-July these funds have been readily available,
apparently mainly in reflection of increased supplies of Euro-dollars
from funds leaving the sterling area and funds from Germany seeking
higher yields. On the other hand, as indicated in Appendix B, banks
have been expecting increased loan demands over coming months and
apparently have been taking the opportunity to obtain CD's and Euro-
dollars now--while they are available--in order to be in a position to
meet those expected demands. The emerging structure of CD rates would
suggest that banks may also be attempting to lengthen their liability
structure so as to be in a better position to meet fall and winter
demands. No information is yet availabile on the maturity structure
of CD sales in August, however. Meanwhile, there are reports that some
Euro-dollar borrowing has been in the 3- and 6-month areas. While banks
may still be expecting greater loan demand, business loans have been
declining recently, and a good share of these funds were used to acquire

III -6
short-term municipals, to make dealer loans at New York and Chicago
banks, and at the end of August to acquire bills.
The money stock in August increased at an 8.8 per cent annual
rate, but growth leveled off in the later part of August--despite a
reduction in Treasury deposits--as bank credit demands abated. So far
in 1967 the money stock has increased at a 7.7 per cent annual rate, and
is currently 5.2 per cent above the year-ago level. As will be recalled,
at this time last year the money stock had not increased for several
months. Over the two years ending August, the money stock as increased
at a 4.8 per cent annual rate.
U.S. Government securities market. Yields on U.S. Government
securities have changed little on balance since mid-August except for
moderate increases in the 3-month bill area and in the maturities sur-
rounding the Treasury's new 3-1/2 year note.

In the Treasury note and bond sector, activity has been
dominated in recent weeks by Treasury financing operations. Shortly
following the mid-August payment date for the regular quarterly refund-
ing (involving a new 15-month note), the Treasury announced a new 3-1/2
year note to raise $2-1/2 billion of new money. Despite the relatively
attractive 5.40 per cent yield on this issue and full tax and loan
account privileges, the market response was modest and the allotment
ratio on subscriptions above $100,000 was set at a moderately high
38 per cent. Subscriptions from major city banks, in particular, were
relatively light, but smaller banks showed an active interest. The
new note traded slightly below its issue price through the August 30
payment date and yields adjusted up on outstanding issues of comparable
maturity.
In recent trading sessions, however, the market for Treasury
notes and bonds has displayed a somewhat improved atmosphere, buoyed in
part by the good receptions accorded some major new corporate issues
(at new high yields) and by System purchases of coupon issues on
August 31, totaling $52 million. Moreover, selling of outstanding
issues on switches into the new 3-1/2 year notes and of the new notes
themselves by banks proved to be lighter than had been anticipated by
many dealers. In fact, it appears that the new note may be in fairly
permanent hands. Most recently it has been quoted on the bid side
slightly above its issue price.
Treasury bill rates have fluctuated over a fairly wide range
in recent weeks, with rates rising on balance in the 3-month maturity

III -8
area. With positions slightly enlarged and demand light late in
August, dealers became aggressive sellers of bills, but most recently
demand from investors, supplemented by System purchases, has been
strong and rates have receded from their peaks. The recent fluctuations
in bill yields is illustrated by the 3-month bill which was auctioned
at an average rate of 4.19 per cent on August 14, 4.49 per cent on
August 28, and 4.32 per cent on September 1.
Yields on short-term debt market instruments other than
Treasury bills have shown small mixed changes since mid-August, as the
table shows.

Forthcoming Treasury finance. With the completion of its
late August cash financing, the Treasury should be out of the market
until October, apart from $100 million additions to weekly and monthly
bill auctions. The Treasury has indicated that it may need to raise
some $6-1/2 to $7 billion of new money in the fourth quarter, not
counting an additional amount that might be raised through sales of
participation certificates. The Treasury's financing requirements
through direct debt issues will be increased to the extent that it is
not able to sell participation certificates.
Corporate and municipal bond markets. Yields on new and
seasoned corporate bonds, after declining earlier this summer, have
advanced since mid-August to new 1967 highs. While yields on municipal
bonds have also advanced over the same period, they have only matched
their earlier 1967 highs.

The most recent new corporate issues--some carrying all-time
high yields--have been accorded a better response from investors,
following lacklustre receptions registered in preceding weeks. For
example, an Aa-rated public utility issue (carrying 5-year call pro-
tection) was an immediate sell-out last week at a reoffering yield of
a record 6.20 per cent, 3 and 6 basis points above the yields on two
directly comparable issues offered, but largely unsold, during the
preceding week.
While the earlier weak demand for securities resulted in a
build-up of unsold syndicate balances with both corporate and municipal
underwriters, the recent yield mark-up has stimulated renewed investor
interest, and the supply of unsold bonds has been trimmed. For example,
the large unsold balances of the two utility issues mentioned above were
fully distributed after they were released to free market trading. And
other corporate and several municipal issues have also been cut in price
to reduce inventories. As a result, underwriters are presently in a
reasonably good technical position.
A primary factor in the corporate market during August was
the continued pressure of a large volume of public bond offerings,
which aggregated an estimated $1,810 million. August offerings were
more than 50 per cent above the August volume a year ago--previously a
record August--and only about $50 million below the July peak. Total
bond and stock offerings in August were $2,500 million, also slightly
below the June and July volume, with stock offerings and estimated
private placements little changed from earlier months.

III -11
The volume of public offerings now scheduled for September
totals only about $700 million. While further additions to the calendar
are expected, total monthly volume may be no more than $1 billion for
the first time since May. This would still be one-fourth again as large
as September 1966, but it would represent some respite from the unusually
high June through August volume. Moreover, the composition of the
corporate bond calendar by type continues to show an increasing share
of convertible issues, on which net interest costs are lower. The
total September bond and stock volume is expected to aggregate $1.8
billion, about three-fourths of the August total.

State and local government security offerings in August fell
to about $725 million, the lowest volume in more than a year. This was
less than estimated earlier due primarily to the rescheduling of the

III -12
$120 million Kentucky Turnpike issue for later in the year and to the
indefinite postponement of several smaller issues. The calendar for
September, on the other hand, continues to expand rapidly, with offer-
ings presently estimated at $1,250 million, about $200 million more than
in September 1966. In fact, final volume may ultimately prove to be
still larger, since there are rumors of additional large offerings
forthcoming.

NOTE: FHA series; interest rates on conventional first mortgages
(excluding additional fees and charges) are rounded to the nearest 5
basis points; secondary market yields are for certain 6 per cent FHA-
insured Sec. 203 loans.
Rates on conventional first mortgages for existing homes,
not shown in the table, rose again in July to 6.55 per cent, but this
followed a pause in May and June. And although the FHLBB series on
interest rates for conventional home mortgages, which have recently
been revised, also showed some rise for both new and existing home
loans in July, these were the first instances of an advance this year,
and these series tend to lag the more sensitive FHA indicators.
A factor in the moderation of the recent upturn in mortgage
yield requirements has been the still relatively limited volume of new
mortgages being generated and the unusually high level of inflows of
loanable funds to the savinge and loan associations, the major mortgage

III -14
lenders, and to others with broader investment options. In addition,
reluctance to use Government-underwritten mortgages has also been a
factor as secondary market prices have dropped and a return to discounts
averaging in excess of 4 per cent--a resistance point for lenders and
sellers alike--has again been required to produce competitive yields in
recent months.
Trade expectations are that, at the worst, mortgage rates
over the remainder of the year will stay below last winter's peaks.
But because of the narrow spreads now prevailing between bond and
mortgage yields, the outlook for the mortgage market will continue to
depend primarily on pressures in other financial markets.
To bring its secondary market prices more closely into line
with those now being paid by private investors, the Federal National
Mortgage Association, effective August 25, lowered its prices on
eligible home mortgages for purchase in the secondary market by an
average of 1.5 per cent. This was the first price change since a 1 per
cent upward adjustment had been made in early March, when the dominant
trend in mortgage yields, particularly for Government-underwritten
mortgages, had appeared to be clearly downward. Partly, because of the
more favorable prices being offered by FNIA, mortgage offerings by
private holders to FNMA, which had tended to level off at the relatively
advanced weekly rate reached in the latter part of June, had begun to
move higher by mid-August. Such offerings lead purchases by about two
months on the average.

III -15
Despite the competition for loanable funds from other types
of investments, mortgage commitments generally have continued to rise,
and net additions to mortgage portfolios by major lenders as a group
have continued to move above year-earlier levels in recent months.
Underscoring the vastly improved position of the savings and loan
associations in the market so far this year, the S&L advance in net
mortgage holdings this July rather closely approximated the volume in
July of 1965 and more than offset the year-to-year short-fall for other
groups, including the mutual savings banks and FNMA.

Stock market. Common stock prices on both the New York and
the American Exchanges are currently 1 to 2 per cent below the record
highs reached in early August. At this level, NYSE prices--as measured
by both the Standard & Poor's and the NYSE composite indexes--are still
near their 1966 peak. The AMEX index remains about 26 per cent above
its peak level of last year.

III -16
The speculative activity evident in July and early August
apparently abated in the latter half of August. The volume of trading
declined sharply in August, even after normal trading hours were
resumed. By the end of the month, NYSE volume was averaging about
7.0 million shares a day (vs. 12.1 million at the beginning of the
month) and on the American Exchange, volume was only somewhat over
3.0 million (vs. 6.0 million at the beginning of August). As a result,
AMEX volume as a per cent of NYSE volume was down from the 50 per cent
level of early August to 46 per cent by the end of the month.
Furthermore, the quality of the AMEX stocks trading in heavy
volume has apparently improved. Since August 23, on the average, only
4 of the 10 most actively traded AMEX stocks have been priced at $10
or less. This figure compares favorably with the average of 7 during
July and 8 during the first two weeks in August. Also, American
Exchange officials have considered it appropriate to lift 100 per cent
initial margin requirements from 15 stocks since August 8, 9 of these
since August 23, leaving only a more normal 13 under such restrictions.
The New York Stock Exchange, meanwhile, has lifted such restrictions
from 8 of the record 13 issues on which it had, by early August, imposed
100 per cent initial margin requirements.
In July, margin debt--as measured by the New York Stock
Exchange margin panel--rose $180 million, or 3.3 per cent to $5,580.1
1/ The more spectacular July increase of $436 million in customers' net
debit balances included a sharp rise in clearing balances and thus
considerably overstated the expansion in margin debt. Some rise in
clearing balances was to be expected with the increase in trading
volume. In addition, the backlog of "paperwork" caused by the sheer
size of trading volume late in July was reflected in a doubling of
clearings taking more than four days to settle.

III -17
Over the longer period from the January low, margin debt has increased
$730 million or 15 per cent. Growth in July, though substantial, was
considerably less than the revised growth rate of 5.1 per cent in June,
and again took place in accounts with relatively strong equity positions.
The number of margin accounts increased by 15,000 in July, also a much
smaller increase than occurred in June when 25,000 additional accounts
were opened.

U.S. balance of payments. Measured on the liquidity basis,
the rate of the balance of payments deficit for July and August was
somewhat lower than the rate of the first two quarters, but it still
remained uncomfortably large. Evaluation of the recent course of events
is complicated by the wide seasonal movements in trade, tourism and
capital accounts during the summer months, and by more than usual un-
certainties in some of the second quarter balance of payments data.
In that quarter the balance was apparently considerably affected by
large remittances to Israel and tourist expenditures in Canada. Data
for direct investments are still incomplete, and a large part of the
increase in net payments remains unexplained.
For July, the liquidity deficit, unadjusted, amounted to
about $485 million, and weekly figures for August indicate a further
deficit of perhaps $300 million in that month. Seasonal factors tend
to worsen the third quarter as a whole by nearly $600 million, and most
of this probably occurs early in the quarter. The seasonally adjusted
deficit for the two months may thus have been less than $300 million,
compared to quarterly rates of slightly over $1/2 billion in the first
two quarters.
Special receipts improving the balance in July amounted to
$92 million, largely representing the sale to Germany of a $125 million
equivalent nonconvertible 4-1/2 year mark-denominated Treasury note,
partly offset by a liquidation of $33 million of long-term official

IV -II
deposits. This was much below the amounts of receipts from special
transactions in the earlier months of the year which benefitted the
figures as published.
Measured on the official reserve transactions basis, there
was a deficit of $185 million in July -- about offsetting the June
surplus (both figures unadjusted) -- and weekly indicators for August
suggest a surplus of more than $400 million for the month. After
adjustment for adverse seasonal factors, the balance on official settle-
ments in July-August was in surplus by more than $1/2 billion.
The markedly favorable shift in the balance on official settle-
ments that began in June was related to a substantial pick-up in Euro-
dollar inflows to the foreign branches of U.S. banks. Most of these
inflows are reflected in increased liabilities of U.S. banks to their
foreign branches, which rose $1.2 billion between May 31 and August 30.
But the foreign branches also used Euro-dollars in June to purchase
foreign loans from the portfolios of U.S. head offices, reselling only
some of the loans back to the head offices in July. Thus, use of Euro-
dollars obtained by the foreign branches to supplement head office
liquidity positions is understated by the change in liabilities to
branches in June, and overstated by a lesser amount by the change in
liabilities in July.
LIABILITIES OF U.S. BANKS TO THEIR FOREIGN BRANCHES
(Millions of dollars)
Dec. 30, 1966 $3,381* June 30, 1967 $3,012*
Mar. 31, 1967 3,144* July 26, 1967 3,660
May 30, 1967 2,776* Aug. 30, 1967 3,976
*End-of-month dates. Liabilities typically drop sharply at end of
month.

IV -3
The increased level of Euro-dollar borrowing by the foreign
branches in June was accompanied by increased Euro-dollar rates. (This
phenomenon, at least in part seasonal, was moderated by BIS place-
ments of funds in the market over mid-year.) But the rise of almost
$1 billion in outstanding Euro-dollar borrowings by the branches since
mid-year has occurred in a period of declining Euro-dollar rates (in
part seasonal), and during the past two months these rates have frequently
been below rates offered by U.S. banks for time deposits, after allowance
for costs arising from reserve requirements and FDIC insurance on domestic
deposits. Thus, while this summer U.S. banks have absorbed an increased
supply of Euro-dollars as it came on to the market (probably in good
part as a result of market uncertainties about sterling), they have
apparently not been bidding aggressively for funds, as was the case a
year earlier.
Merchandise trade. The merchandise surplus in July shows no
improvement over June -- in both months the surplus was about $3.9
billion at an annual rate, slightly below the first quarter, and con-
siderably below the April-May rate. Exports have been nearly level at
an annual rate of $30.7 billion in the first seven months of the year
and give no indication of moving higher. Imports were back at the
relatively high first quarter rate in June and July and have not responded
as yet to the easing in over-all U.S. demand pressures.
The unexpectedly high rate of imports this year may be related
to the greater expansion in recent years in imports of finished manu-
factures than in imports of crude and semifinished products. Imports

IV -4
of several types of finished manufactures have been growing as a pro-
portion of total domestic consumption, and they are not as responsive
to domestic cyclical changes as imports of industrial materials. This
imparts greater stability to the import-GNP relationship than has been
the case in the past. (See Appendix C for additional information on
trends in U.S. imports.)
Changes in U.S. foreign trade as a result of the Arab-Israeli
war probably added about $25 million to our trade surplus in July.
Exports of crude petroleum to Canada, the United Kingdom and other
Western European countries, which are ordinarily negligible, expanded
sharply to $30 million in July as tanker fleets were redeployed and
the world trade pattern in petroleum was reshuffled.
Oil shipments are reported heavy through August but are expected
to decline in September as the embargo by the Arab countries ends and
other arrangements made by Canada and the European countries to obtain
oil from non-U.S. suppliers become effective.
The customary sources of crude petroleum for U.S. consumption
were also modified as a result of the Mid-East war. Canadian oil was
shunted to the West Coast of the U.S. and some Venezuelan oil ordinarily
imported by the U.S. was diverted to Europe. U.S. domestic production
was stepped up to replace the diverted Venezuelan crude. The July
trade pattern for oil imports were also expected to be short-lived and
the pre-war marketing relationships are expected to be resumed in September.
U.S. exports to the Arab countries declined from May to July
by about $40 million, or by more than the reduction in imports from
those countries during the same period.

IV -5
Capital accounts. Transactions in foreign securities
resulted in a net capital outflow of about $150 million in July. This
relatively large amount included gross purchases of about $130 million
of new Canadian bonds, $22 million of IBRD issues, and purchases of
about $50 million of Israeli issues. In August, sales of new foreign
bonds in the U.S. were probably considerably lower, as Canadian issues
dropped off sharply. Foreigners continued to buy substantial amounts
of U.S. securities in July, including nearly $90 million, net, of
corporate stocks, and $133 million of bonds. A large part of the
purchases of bonds represents issues sold to foreigners by U.S. companies
for the purpose of financing their direct foreign investments.
Outstanding bank loans and acceptance credits to foreigners
fell about $50 million in July, with small net declines in both short-
and long-term credits. In the month there was an inflow of over $100
million from Australia as bank financing was replaced with the proceeds
of a bond issue, but this was nearly offset by reported additions to
bank credits that represented repurchases from foreign branches of
loans sold to them in June. New commitments on long-term loans have
picked up since April and are running at a rate of $100 million a
month, compared to $75 million a month in 1966. At the current rate
of commitment, gross disbursements on new loans may about match gross
repayments on outstandings -- thus ending the net reflow of long-term
bank credits. Most of the stepped-up new commitments are to LDC's,
and commitments to developed countries are apparently largely for
financing of U.S. exports.

IV -6
Cyclical Pbyelopments Abroad
The combined industrial output of Western Europe has been
on a plateau since the spring of 1966. For the fifth consecutive
quarter there was little change in the second quarter of 1967 as
seen in the table below. During the last three of these quarters,
industrial output in the United States and in Canada was also level
or declining. Thus, this has been a period of general stagnation in
major industrial countries--the first such period since 1958. Only
in Japan and Italy has vigorous expansion continued.

The European slowdown started in Germany and the United
Kingdom in the second quarter of 1966, and spread--with varying time
lags and intensities--to most other European countries. French
industrial production leveled off in the last quarter of 1966. Thus,
by that time industrial output in all three of the largest economies
of Western Europe had ceased to rise. By the second quarter of 1967,
declines from earlier peak quarters amounted to 5 per cent for Germany,
3-1/2 per cent for Britain, and 1-1/2 per cent for France, where,
however, several major strikes took place in April and May. A number
of the smaller countries in Europe were also experiencing either slow-
downs or actual declines.
The use of expansionary policies has been restrained in
many countries by concern over actual or anticipated price and cost
developments, and in some by external payments difficulties (e.g.
Britain) and budgetary problems (e.g. Germany). Germany, and more
recently France, have instituted some moderate fiscal and monetary
measures, and the German recession appears to have bottomed out while
the French industrial production may soon begin to rise slowly. In
Britain, only very cautious policy stimulants have seemed appropriate,
given the persisting balance of payments difficulties.
The general slowdown has caused fairly sharp rises in
unemployment in most European countries. The rate of unemployment,
though still low by American standards, is becoming especially
worrisome politically in the United Kingdom, where it reached 2.4 per
cent, seasonally adjusted, in August, the highest since early 1963.

IV -8
In Germany, the umemployment rate in July was only 2 per cent, but
nearly 300 thousand fewer foreign workers were employed in that
country in June than a year earlier, while total industrial employ-
ment had declined by 7 per cent over approximately the same period.
The effects of the slowdown in Europe are clearly reflected
in the foreign trade figures as seen in the table on the following page.
Growth in imports of OECD European countries combined has slowed down
markedly, and large declines have been registered by Germany since
early 1966 and by France since early 1967. These declines, together
with a decline in U.S. imports, have in turn adversely affected the
exports of many countries. Exports have in most cases not actually
fallen, but their rate of advance has slowed down. Italy has been
the major exception; Italian exports advanced sharply further during
the first half of 1967, thanks partly to buoyant shipments to less
developed countries and Eastern Europe, but also to increases in
exports to Western Europe and North America, where Italian exporters
have increased their market shares.
The European slowdown has significantly affected U.S.
exports. In the first quarter of 1967, only 32 per cent of U.S.
exports went to Western Europe compared with 36 per cent a year
earlier. The U.S. market share in EEC imports declined to 10.5 per
cent in the first quarter of 1967 from 11.4 per cent a year earlier.
The continuing stagnation of economic activity has caused
widespread downward revisions in the expected rates of real national
income growth in 1967. The real gross domestic product (GDP) in

Britain may be only 1-1/2 per cent larger this year than in 1966.
The real French GDP, originally projected by the government in the
fall of 1966 to increase 5 per cent this year, may not grow by more
than 2-1/2 per cent. The German GDP seems likely to be down by
about 2 per cent in real terms--the first year-to-year decline for
any major Continental European country since World War II. On the
other hand, the real Italian GDP is expected to be 5-1/2 per cent
higher this year, as much as the growth in 1966.
The combined GDP of European members of the OECD may
increase by only 1-1/2 to 2 per cent in real terms from 1966 to
1967, even assuming some moderate upturn in the second half of this
year. This rate of growth would be below that of 2.1 per cent
recorded in 1958, and would, in fact, be the lowest since at least
1951, the first year for which a combined figure has been calculated.
In Germany the recession--now more than a year old--seems
to have bottomed out. Over the past two months there has been some
improvement in business confidence, as indicated by a 19 per cent rise
in the stock market, and recovery may even have begun. The Bundesbank
reports signs of inventory rebuilding by producers; outstanding bank
loans in June, although still below 1966 levels, increased more than
seasonally over May; domestic new orders in June were 2-1/2 per cent
above the April level, and seasonally adjusted unemployment declined
a total of 9.2 per cent in June and July from the May level. However,
these encouraging signs are too scattered as yet to enable us to
expect a strong upturn in the German economy in the near future.

IV -11
Reflecting weakness in domestic demand, German imports in 1967 are
expected to be about 5 to 6 per cent below their 1966 level, as
opposed to an 8 per cent increase which might have been expected
under conditions of full employment.
Real GDP in the United Kingdom appears on balance to have
shown no real growth in the first half of the year. Very recently,
however, some signs of a possible upturn have been visible: industrial
production rose in June, exports increased in July, and bank loans
registered sharp gains in both months. Mounting unemployment is
exerting strong political pressure on the government, but the recent
assumption of economic "tsardom" by the Prime Minister is not expected
to lead to a very sharp reflationary policy. Relaxationsof restrictions
on installment buying, announced August 31, are not expected to have
a large effect on the economy.
In France industrial production has continued to stagnate
and unemployment through August 1 was rising steadily, if slowly,
However, several moderately expansionary government moves and the
results of the mid-July INSEE business survey, which showed a somewhat
less gloomy business outlook, lead us to expect some slight revival
in the second half of 1967.
The slowdown in Belgium, in contrast with other European
countries, started early in 1965 and, since then, the growth of real
GDP has tended to decelerate. Stagnant exports this year have further
weakened aggregate demand. At the same time, the rise of both private
and public domestic consumption spending has probably continued to

IV -12
decelerate as well. Real GNP may grow this year by only 2 per
cent, compared with an estimated real growth of 3 per cent
in 1966.
Economic activity in the Netherlands largely reflects the
efforts taken in previous years by the authorities to curb inflationary
pressures, as well as weak demand in neighboring countries. Most
affected was business investment spending, which this year is expected
to be no larger in real terms than in 1966. As in Belgium, exports
this year trended downward and domestic consumption has increased less
vigorously than in previous years. The original official forecast
of 3.5 per cent real growth in 1967 has now been scaled down to
3.0 per cent. This may be compared with actual growth of 4.5 per
cent in 1966 and 5.4 per cent in 1965.
In Sweden, after virtual stagnation for nearly a year,
economic activity picked up sharply in the second quarter of this
year with industrial production rising by 2-1/2 per cent in that
quarter. Exports have been rising satisfactorily and imports have
remained steady. With reported increases in new orders, the general
outlook is now much more optimistic. In Denmark, the economy is
still overheated, and fiscal and monetary policies of restraint will
probably be maintained. The Austrian economy, while not in a state
of actual recession, appears to be stabilizing at a level well
below capacity. In Switzerland, several signs of leveling off
appeared in the second quarter of 1967, with several key industries
reporting distinct slowdowns.

IV -13
The first half of 1967 saw litde change in industrial
activity in Canada. With continuing improvement in Canadian
exports, the slowdown appears to be due to the ending of the long
investment boom. Unemployment has continued to increase and in July
it stood at 4.3 per cent of the labor force, up from the low of
3.3 per cent reached in April 1966. The growth of the labor force
has been bolstered by a rapid increase in immigration, which has
recently been running 35 per cent ahead of a year earlier. As of
now, signs of the expected upturn in the second half of the year are
lacking, and we expect the real Canadian GNP to grow by no more than
3 per cent tis year.
In Japan industrial production increased 8.8 per cent
during the first half of the year, and the underlying demand situation
remains strong. Rapidly expanding imports and slackening exports have
led to a large trade deficit, and in order to restrain the rapidly
expanding economy, the Bank of Japan increased its basic discount rate
from 5.48 per cent to 5.85 per cent on September 1. In addition,
it is planned to reduce government public works expenditures and to
tighten quantitative informal restraints on commercial bank lending.
For the current fiscal year, ending next March, the Government in May
forecast an increase of 9 per cent in real GNP; we now expect this
increase to be slightly larger. In the last fiscal year, real GNP
increased by an estimated 10.8 per cent.

APPENDIX A: REVISION OF NONFARM PAYROLL DATA*
August data on employment, hours and earnings reflect both
the BLS revision to March 1966 benchmark levels and a recalculation
of seasonal factors. Unadjusted data on average hours and earnings
in manufacturing were little changed by the revision. The revision
to benchmark levels was carried back to March 1965 for most series
and to March 1964 for a few manufacturing series because of changes
in classification. The seasonally adjusted series have been revised
beginning with January 1956.

unrevised. About one-half of the relatively small revision occurred
in manufacturing. Most of the 105,000 upward adjustment of the

manufacturing total occurred in the machinery (except electrical)
industry (up 54,000) and in primary metals (up 34,000). Revisions in
nonmanufacturing industries were relatively small and generally upward.
State and local government, retail trade, construction, finance, trans-
portation and public utilities were revised upward; while in wholesale
trade and services, employment was revised down slightly. The revisions
in the seasonally adjusted series on average weekly hours of production
workers in manufacturing produce a somewhat smoother series, but one
little changed in the level from the unrevised data.

APPENDIX B: SURVEY OF BANK LENDING PRACTICES. AUGUST 1967*
On August 15 about one-third of the 125 respondents in the
Bank Lending Practices Survey reported increased loan demand between
mid-May and mid-August, as compared to the previous three months (see
Table 1). While about the same proportion of banks had indicated
stronger loan demands in the previous survey, a smaller number in
August indicated weaker demands--only about 11 per cent as compared
to 21 per cent in May. Stronger loan demand was again reported mainly
at banks with total deposits less than $1 billion (compare Tables 2
and 3), and was particularly noticeable at banks in the Northeast ex-
cluding New York City.
Lending Terms, Conditions, and Availability
While most respondents did not change either their price or
nonprice terms and conditions of lending to nonfinancial businesses
from May to August, the number of banks reporting somewhat firmer con-
ditions increased. A little over one-fifth of respondents indicated that
they had moderately firmed their interest rate policies over the
summer, and none indicated easing. Many of these had reported a more
relaxed policy in May. About the same proportion also reported in-
creased attention to compensating balances, and slightly more than one-
fourth attached greater importance to the value of the deposits and
collateral business of the loan customer. Approximately one-fourth of
respondents indicated firmer policies regarding loans to new customers,
while about one-fifth noted firmer policies toward nonlocal service
area customers. Only about 13 per cent of reporting banks, however,
reported that higher standards of credit worthiness were being applied,
and less than 10 per cent reported firmer policies towards maturity
of term loans.
Moderately firmer policies were also indicated for noncaptive
finance companies, mainly with respect to enforcement of balance require-
ments and the establishment of new and larger credit lines.
In general, tightening in lending terms appeared to be
related to increased loan demands over the summer, but seemed even
more strongly associated with anticipation of stronger loan demands
over the August-November period.
* Prepared by Rosalie T. Ruegg, Economist, Banking Section, Division
of Research and Statistics.

B -2
Willingness To Make Other Types Of Loans
There was a wider range of reported willingness to make
various types of loans. A number of banks reported some restraint
on term loans and mortgage loans other than single family mortgages,
but a few banks with good time deposit inflows relative to loans demand,
and with outstanding loans of this type below their budget, indicated
more willingness to make such loans.
In contradiction to the increased incidence of reports of
tighter policies, between 10 and 15 per cent of respondents were more
willing to make consumer installment, single-family mortgage, and
participation loans. This was true of a larger percentage of banks
with deposits of $1 billion or more, and was particularly evident on
the West Coast. A number of the banks in this group attributed their
easier policy to continuing large inflows of deposits--particularly
time and savings deposits. Several commented that the higher rates
payable on these deposits had caused them to seek higher yielding assets--
particularly single-family mortgages and consumer loans.
Anticipated loan Demand
About two-thirds of all respondents anticipate stronger busi-
ness loan demands over the mid-August to mid-November period. Some
of these with good current liquidity positions indicated that they did
not ease over the summer due to these expectations. It seems clear
that while some banks have recently firmed lending practices because
of current liquidity positions and higher loan demands, expectations
of stronger loan demands and higher interest rates played a major part
in establishing recent policies. For example, some banks indicated
that they were discouraging term borrowing in an effort to hedge
against being locked into longer-term credits at fixed interest rates,
and that they were "culling out" other types of loans that might
decrease their flexibility late this year or early next year.
In interpreting the increased expectation of higher loan
demands, it must be recalled that respondents have proved poor predictors
of their loan demand all year. In both the May and August surveys,
only about one-third of banks that had previously anticipated a rise
in demand actually reported that an increase had occurred. A larger
percentage of banks that had anticipated stronger loan demand this
year subsequently reported demand unchanged.
It is entirely possible that bankers' expectations in mid-
August were biased upward by the combination of surprise at the size of
borrowing in recent months--mainly associated with accelerated tax
payments, now mostly over for the year--rising market rates of interest,
and growing unanimity about the acceleration of the economy. These
developments might have produced inflated expectations about the size
of business loan demands in coming months.

APPENDIX C: TRENDS IN U.S. FOREIGN TRADE*
The U.S. foreign trade surplus moved generally upward in
the first five months of this year, averaging $4.3 billion, but fell
to $3.9 billion in June and July.
Exports established record highs early this year, but have
not gained ground since April. Imports which had receded from the
near-record January value to a relatively low level in May, rebounded
sharply in the next two months to equal the high values of last fall.
The leveling off in exports is not surprising in view of
the sluggishness in economic activity in some of our principal markets,
particularly Europe, and the relatively low shipments of agricultural
products. The sustained high rate of imports, and their recent advance
is more difficult to account for. It had been anticipated, based on
past relationships of imports to domestic economic activity, that
imports would have declined by an additional $1 billion at an annual
rate, in the first half of this year. Despite the slowdown in domestic
output and the general easing in supply conditions this year, the
current ratio of imports to GNP is still very high -- 3.4 per cent --
only fractionally below the ratio of last year when domestic activity
was proceeding at a much more rapid pace. From 1960 through 1964 this
ratio was consistently below 3.0 per cent. The failure of imports to
decline as expected this year suggests that some structural change
may have occurred which is affecting the response of imports to domestic
cyclical variations. A review of import developments in the past six
years would tend to support this belief.
Since 1960 imports of finished manufactures have increased
more rapidly than imports of crude and semifinished industrial materials
and foodstuffs. In the first half of 1967 finished manufactures were
about 45 per cent of total imports compared with 30 per cent in 1960.
Conversely the share of industrial materials and foodstuffs dropped
sharply during this period. The expansion in imports of capital equip-
ment, motor vehicles and nonfood consumer goods -- the major components
of finished manufactures -- has been particularly strong since 1964.
These fast-growing categories of imports account for an increased pro-
portion of total domestic expenditure on these types of goods.
Purchases of foreign capital equipment, mainly machinery
but also aircraft, quadrupled from 1960 to 1967, more than twice the
rate of increase in total domestic expenditures on producers' durable
equipment. The ratio of imports to total expenditures for such goods
has more than doubled, from 2.4 per cent in 1960 to 5.4 in the first

Division of International Finance.

C- 2
half of 1967. This ratio has now fallen somewhat below the peak rate
of last fall, possibly reflecting the shortening of delivery schedules
for domestically produced equipment.
A somewhat similar trade pattern was evident in imports of
nonfood consumer goods (excluding automobiles). Purchases of such items
from foreign sources, including radio and T.V. sets, motorcycles, tape
recorders and sporting goods, have increased steadily since 1961, topping
a $4 billion annual rate for the first time in late 1966 and in the
first six months of 1967. At this rate these imports were equal in
value to 3.2 per cent of total U.S. spending on nonfood consumer goods
in the first half of this year, only a very slight increase over the
ratio in 1966 but about one full percentage point above the 1960 ratio.
At the current level of consumer expenditures on goods, a one percentage
point difference in this ratio is equivalent to more than $1 billion of
imports at an annual rate.
The complexion of U.S. foreign trade in motor vehicles has
been completely transformed in the last few years. These changes may
be attributed to two events.
1. The enactment of the U.S.-Canadian Automotive
Agreement in 1965, permitting duty-free move-
ment of motor vehicle and original equipment
parts between the U.S. and Canada.
2. The resurgence of passenger car imports from
non-Canadian sources, principally Europe but
also more recently Japan.
As a result, imports of motor vehicles and parts more than
tripled in value from 1964 to the first half of 1967. The nearly $2.5
billion (annual rate) of imports in January-June of this year is equivalent
to over 5.5 per cent of total domestic manufacturers' shipments; this
compares with about 2 per cent in 1964.
Exports of motor vehicles have also expanded over this period
but at a much slower rate. Consequently, the export balance on such
products has shrunk from over $1 billion in 1964 to about $100 million
in the first half of this year.
The area distribution of our trade in these commodities has
also shifted radically. Canada has now become the major supplier and
market in automotive products, accounting for over 60 per cent of both
exports and imports in the first six months of this year. Imports from
Canada in 1964 were less than $100 million, about 10 per cent of total
automotive imports. In 1967, however, arrivals from Canada are running
at an annual rate of $1.5 billion. The expansion in exports of automotive

C-3
products to Canada has been less marked, resulting in a reduction of
about $500 million in the export balance in these commodities with
Canada.
Our trade position in automotive products with other countries
has also deteriorated since 1964, as imports have increased while exports
have remained stable. Following the import car boom of 1959, when foreign
cars accounted for about 10 per cent of total domestic sales, purchases
of foreign cars fell to about 6 per cent of the total domestic car market.
In 1966, however, imports of foreign cars began to rise again while
sales of domestic cars declined. Imported cars were about 8.5 per cent
of total car sales in the first half of 1967, the highest ratio since 1959.
In contrast to the growing importance of imported products in
total domestic expenditures for the three commodity categories discussed
above, imported foodstuffs continue to account for about 4 per cent of
total spending on foods and imports of industrial materials account for
about 2.5 per cent of final sales of goods (GNP less services and
inventory changes). (Adjustment of the data for stockpile releases,
which have been sizable in the past two years, would not significantly
raise this latter ratio.)
Although total imports of materials have been a relatively
stable proportion of final sales, some components have shown marked
growth. In particular imports of iron and steel rose sharply in 1965
in anticipation of a steel strike and have stayed high through the first
part of 1967. At the present time imported steel constitutes about 11 per
cent of total domestic supplies, compared with between 5 and 7 per cent
from 1960 to 1964. Japan has emerged as the leading foreign supplier of
steel and accounted for much of the impetus for the 1965-66 boom in U.S.
steel imports. In the first half of 1967, however, imports from Japan
dropped, reflecting intense home demand in that country, while deliveries
from Germany, Belgium and the United Kingdom increased sharply.
A consequence of the shift in the composition of imports from
crude and semifinished products to finished products has been the changed
area distribution of imports. The industrial countries -- Canada, Western
Europe and Japan -- supplied about two-thirds of all imports in the first
half of 1967 compared with about 55 per cent in 1960. The less-developed
countries which produce food and crude and semifinished materials, were
the source of one-third of total imports, considerably below the 45 per
cent coming from these countries in 1960.
Some tentative conclusions are suggested by the trade develop-
ments outlined above.

C -4
1. If imports of those commodities whichlaccount for an
increasing proportion of total domestic expenditures -- capital equip-
ment, automobiles and nonfood consumer goods -- continue to increase
their relative importance in total imports, then the ratio of total
imports to GNP can be expected to increase.
2. Several of the fast-growing imports categories such as
automobiles and nonfood consumer goods may not be as responsive to
cyclical changes in the U.S. as industrial materials whose weight in
total imports is declining. This may result in a greater stability over
the cycle in the import-GNP ratio than has previously been the case.
3. With an increasing share of total imports being provided
by industrial countries, imports may be more affected by cyclical changes
in these countries than in the past. It is quite possible, for example,
that the current high level of imports may, in part, be related to the
slackening in the growth of internal demand in other industrialized
countries relative to their productive capacities. The expansion in
imports of steel from Germany in the first half of this year may be an
illustration of this type of situation.
