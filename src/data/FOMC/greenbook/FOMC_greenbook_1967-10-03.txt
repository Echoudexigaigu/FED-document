SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK
Outlook for economic activity
Recent information gives further support to the estimate of a
$15 billion increase in GNP in the third quarter. The fourth quarter
rise in GNP is still projected to be larger than in the third quarter--
probably $20 billion or so. The real rate of growth is likely to accel-
erate from about 5 per cent to 6.5 per cent and the rate of advance in
prices to be somewhat higher than in the third quarter.
The accelerated growth of income and product is being accom-
panied by a general trend toward larger wage increases, a somewhat
tighter labor market, and numerous increases in basic materials and
finished goods prices. Our projection for the fourth quarter assumes
a continuation of these trends and also is premised on the assumption
that a tax surcharge will not be in effect before the end of the year--
a prospect that seems increasingly likely--and that auto strikes will
not be prolonged beyond the end of October.
Rapid growth in consumer expenditures is providing much of
the impetus for the expanding economy, with large gains in personal
income recorded in the third quarter and an even more rapid increase
expected in the fourth quarter. In the third quarter, outlays for
nondurable goods apparently rose faster than had been anticipated last
month. While a low level of auto stocks occasioned a sharp drop in
unit sales, demands for autos were sufficiently strong to prevent the
usual summer decline in new auto prices. The rate of expenditure for
total consumer durable.goods as a whole was maintained at the second
quarter level.

Fourth quarter consumer spending should be buoyed by the
effected step-up in gains in income, as well as by a spill-over of new
car demand from the third quarter. If work stoppages in the auto in-
dustry are over by the end of October, production of cars should be
sufficient to support a sharp rise in the rate of unit sales for the
quarter. A further brisk rise in nondurable goods outlays is also
likely. High levels of consumer outlays could be attained without cut-
ting into the relatively high saving rates of recent quarters.
Residential construction is responding to the enlarged flow
of mortgage funds thus far this year, although mortgage interest rates
are high and have recently turned up. The annual rate of housing starts
in the fourth quarter should be around 1.4 million, 500,000 above a year
ago.
Durable goods orders have declined substantially in the last
two months, but this has resulted mainly from a sharp fall-off in de-
fense ordering, which had been very high in May and June, and which
have fluctuated over a wide range. New orders for machinery and equip-
ment, on the other hand, continued the substantial recovery underway
since the February low. This lends some credence to reports from pri-
vate surveys indicating increases in plant and equipment outlays next
year.

Resource use and prices
Following a rapid rise in July and August, industrial pro-
duction is probably declining moderately this month because of the Ford
strike and a reversal of the summer's sharp run-up in crude oil output.
Resumption of an upward movement is production--and in over-all manu-
facturing capacity utilization--must wait on settlement of the auto
strike. Renewed high levels of auto output to make up for strike losses
and to meet expected consumer demands for 1968 models will itself pro-
vide a major fillip to industrial production. Moreover, with the in-
ventory adjustment (apart from autos) apparently over, continuation of
recent rising sales trends for other consumer goods, for residential
construction materials and equipment, and for defense products should
provide basic expansive thrust to industrial production.
The over-all productivity and labor cost picture in the weeks
ahead wtll be muddied for the duration of the auto strike, and the ex-
pected large auto wage settlement may accelerate further the upward
trend in wage rates. But, resumption of rapid expansion in industrial
production--within the context of generally ample capacity at least for
some months--will undoubtedly be accompanied by large productivity gains,
such as accompanied the upturn in output in July and August.
Price increases for industrial materials and products continue
to be widespread. Price increases at wholesale to date may have re-
flected mainly a "catch up" bulge to cover large cost increases from
late 1966 through mid-1967 when over-all demand pressures were slack.
Industrial capacity remains generally ample and expanding and import
competition strong, but with domestic demands moving up a permissive

I-4
atmosphere for price increases has prevailed since midyear. As recent
increases in prices of materials are passed through to finished com-
modities at wholesale and then, perhaps with some widening of margins,
to retail prices, continued sizable gains in average prices of indus-
trial commodities seems likely--at least until upward pressures on unit
labor costs slacken appreciably. Generally stable farm and food prices,
however, are likely to provide some moderation to the upward movement
of the over-all price indexes.
Capital markets outlook
Bond yields have come under renewed upward pressure recently,
reflecting more an investor hesitancy rather than extraordinary supply.
Investor attitudes have been influenced by the recent rise in short-
term rates and by continuing concern about inflationary price movements
and the prospects for fiscal and monetary policies. In such an environ-
ment, capital market rates may continue to drift somewhat further up-
wards, particularly municipal yields in view of the still sizable over-
hang of new issues. Announcement in late October of the Treasury's mid-
November refunding may be the occasion for further rate adjustments in
the U.S. Government securities market.
While financing demands of State and local governments have
risen recently, corporate borrowing demands in capital markets have
tapered off. The volume of publicly-offered corporate bonds is expected
to total about $1 billion in September--$700 million less than the
monthly average for the preceding three months--and may drop somewhat
lower in October. And the monthly volume of corporate offerings is

I-5
generally expected to remain relatively moderate, on balance, over the
rest of the year.
With other long-term market rates remaining high, mortgage
yields are likely to remain near current levels or, as may be suggested
by the current unusually narrow spread of mortgages over other bond
yields, advance further. Moreover, the recent advance of short- and
intermediate-term rates raises the question whether net savings flows to
depositary-type institutions and to the mortgage market can continue in
the near-record volume that prevailed through August.
Currently, rates on short- and intermediate-term Treasury
securities are showing spreads over the rates paid on claims at thrift
institutions nearly as wide as those that prevailed in mid-1966. How-
ever, yields on Federal Agency issues and other short-term market in-
struments show a substantially smaller spread above savings rates than
in the earlier period. And commercial banks are competing much less
aggressively for consumer-type accounts than they were in the second
and third quarter periods of major difficulty during 1966 when the
ceiling interest rate for banks was higher. Thus, a substantial drop
in net savings inflows in October is not likely, although some tapering
off may develop. Savings and loan associations are reportedly adhering
to a rather cautious policy on forward loan commitments; many S&L's are
reportedly committing expected flows only a few weeks ahead and are
seeking to avoid reliance on the Federal Home Loan Banks.

I-6
Outlook for banking
A number of factors may contribute to continued expansion in
bank credit over the balance of the year, though at a slower pace than
during most of the summer. A substantial bulge is likely to be associ-
ated with the Treasury's $4.5 billion tax bill financing to be paid for
on October 9 with 75 per cent tax and loan credit. Moreover, business
loans, which declined almost continuously from late July through mid-
September, are likely to show a moderate rise in the weeks ahead.
Payments of withheld taxes in October are expected to be somewhat in
excess of last year's accelerated pace, and as the fourth quarter pro-
gresses a modest inventory restocking may add to loan demands. Also,
in view of the reduced volume of capital market financing in recent
weeks, repayments of bank loans probably will fall off.
With loan demands picking up but still remaining moderate,
banks are not likely to make an aggressive effort to add to outstand-
ing CD's, although they can be expected at least to replace their Sep-
tember run-offs. Longer-term bill rates have risen recently, and banks
will find it more difficult to attract longer maturity CD's at the
5-1/2 per cent ceiling, and virtually impossible if bill rates rise
significantly further. Consequently, they may have to shorten matur-
ities in the process of maintaining, or further increasing, CD's out-
standing.
Inflows of consumer savings, which appear to have slackened
somewhat over the past few weeks, may edge off slightly further as
yields on market instruments begin to exercise some attraction. Demand
deposits are likely to grow more rapidly than in recent weeks--in the

near term mainly in the form of U.S. Government deposits derived from
payment of the new tax bill through tax and loan crediting and from
payments to the Treasury of withheld income taxes.
The balance of payments
The payments deficit on the published liquidity basis now
appears to have changed little from the second quarter to the third, re-
maining at an annual rate of roughly $2 billion. If the balance is
struck before crediting placements of foreign official funds in U.S.
time deposits maturing in more than one year--which were large in the
second quarter but have been negligible so far in the third--there was
a considerable quarter-to-quarter improvement. However, this modified
balance was as large for the four quarters through September as for the
four quarters through June--roughly $3 billion.
The trade surplus increased from the second quarter to July-
August as imports fell off. Also, there was probably some reduction
in two items that had bulged adversely in the second quarter--remit-
tances to Israel, and net unidentified payments. Travel payments to
Canada probably remained high.
The balance on the official reserve transactions basis swung
even more sharply, from large deficit in the second quarter to large
surplus in the third, as U.S. banks obtained a greatly increased volume
of liquid funds from their foreign branches, especially in July-August.
For this balance too, however, there was about as large a deficit in the
latest four quarters as during the four quarters through June--roughly
$2 billion.

1-8
Thus, there does not appear to have been any fundamental
change in the over-all payments position, and none is yet in view. In-
dustrial production in Germany and Britain turned up in July, and
cyclical recovery in Europe is expected to contribute renewed strength
to U.S. exports during the remainder of the year. But imports are also
likely to be rising, in line with domestic expansion. Also, net out-
flows of U.S. direct investment capital will be somewhat larger during
the second half year than in the first, according to projections sub-
mitted by corporations to the Commerce Department.
Sterling has continued under pressure in foreign exchange
markets. During the first half year, Britain's basic payments balance
on current and long-term capital transactions failed to show the hoped-
for surplus, and merchandise trade continued somewhat disappointing in
July-August. With demand from Continental Europe and the United States
now expanding again, U.K. exports may soon turn up. But the extent of
any prospective improvement in the basic balance remains uncertain,
since imports are also likely to be rising. Market confidence in the
future prospects for sterling remains at a low ebb.

THE ECONOMIC PICTURE IN DETAIL
The Nonfinancial Scene
Gross nationa, product. In the absence of fiscal restraint,
the speed-up in the economy we projected last month appears to be under-
way& The increase in the GNP is still expected to accelerate to an
annual rate of $15 billion in the third quarter and then up to $20 billion
in the fourth, and the real rate of growth is likely to climb to 6.5 per
cent next quarter, the fastest rate of expansion since the first quarter
of 1966. The more rapid thrust comes mainly from larger increases in
consumer spending. A resumption of investment in inventories and higher
levels of government outlays are expected to contribute to the anticipated
strong showing in the fourth quarter. Prices also are expected to rise
more rapidly, with anticipated Federal pay increases contributing to
the sharp rise in the GNP deflator.
Underlying the forward impetus in the economy is the
accelerating rise in personal income. The drop in hours and employment
in the industrial sector has been reversed, and wage rates are gaining
at therate of over 5 per cent a year. The rise in personal income in
the third quarter is expected to be $12 billion, almost half again as
large as the average quarterly rise in the first half of the year. By
the fourth quarter, the rate of income expansion, bolstered by the expected
Federal pay raise, should increase even faster, A prolongation of the
auto strike into November, or its extension to other producers, would of
course, slow the expansion. However, we have no reason as yet to change
our assumption that settlements will be worked out by the end of
October.

II -2
Compared with income gains of this magnitude the substantial
rise in consumer spending shown in the projection for next quarter is
moderate--$10 billion for the quarter. Durable goods expenditures
are expected to rise sharply, as supplies of autos are replenished,
while the rise in nondurable goods purchases is expected to approach
the large increase of the third quarter.
Sales of autos fell sharply in the third quarter (from an
annual rate of 7.8 million in the second quarter to an estimated 7.4
million) mainly as a result of supply shortages. However, expenditures
were maintained at the earlier levels because the normal seasonal decline
in prices did not occur. In the fourth quarter, sales are expected to
rise to an annual rate of 8.25 million units and prices per unit to
increase by about $125 dollars on the average. (Part of this increase
represents quality improvement and will not result in a rise in the
deflator.)
Sales of furniture and appliances, which appeared to be
strengthening last month, have proved weaker than expected, but they
are likely to rise in the fourth quarter in response to higher incomes
and a rising rate of home completions.
In the nondurable goods sector, the third quarter increase
now appears to have been much stronger than anticipated last month,
with higher prices for apparel, gasoline, and other items apparently
playing a considerable role. In the fourth quarter, the rate of rise,
while still large, is projected to be somewhat below that in the
third quarter. Food prices, which have risen sharply recently, are
expected to show little further increase.

II -3
The saving rate is assumed to show little change in the fourth
quarter at its current relatively high level. In the past, a sharp
rise in disposable income usually has been associated with a constant
or increasing saving rate., Since our projection shows a rapid rate
of advance in income from the second to fourth quarters, a rise in
the saving rate would have been a reasonable expectation. However, in
view of the large rise in auto sales, with an expected accompanying
increase in instalment credit, we now look for little change in the
saving rate.
Defense spending is still contributing strongly to GNP
growth, although the rate of advance in the third quarter has been
slower than in the first half of the year. This trend is in line with
the Budget plus the $4 billion supplemental which indicate a moderating
rise in defense outlays over this fiscal year. However, in the fourth
quarter, an expected pay raise for civilian personnel in the defense
department and military personnel will add well over a billion dollars
(annual rate) to expenditures, pushing the rate of increase back up
to the earlier pace, Federal nondefense spending is estimated to be
rising in both the third and fourth quarters largely because inventories
of the CCC are growing. But in the fourth quarter about half a billion
dollars will be added by the anticipated civilian pay increase.
I/ In the 58 quarters since 1952, an acceleration in the quarterly rate of
rise in personal income of 0.5 per cent has occurred twelve times, and
in ten of these times the rate of saving has increased or remained at
the level of the previous quarter.

II -4
The Federal deficit on income and product account rose
sharply in the second quarter to a seasonally adjusted annual rate
of almost $15 billion, as expenditures rose and receipts from personal
taxes declined somewhat. The third and fourth quarters are expected
to show only a slightly reduced deficit. Although corporate profits
may rebound breaking a projected rate of $84.5 billion at year end
and personal income is estimated to rise at a faster pace, the increase
in Federal spending is likely to offset most of the resulting growth
in receipts. For the calendar year 1967, the deficit may be close to
$13.5 billion.
In the State and local area, increased services, pay increases
comparable with those in private industry, and a high level of public
works account for the rapid expansion in expenditures. Receipts, from
old and new tax sources, together with Federal grants-in-aid, are
approximately matching the expansion in spending.
The demand for housing, coupled with the enlarged flow of
mortgage funds, is resulting in a rise in new home starts in line
with earlier expectations. Starts in August maintained the advanced
July rate, indicating that the third quarter average rate of 1.35
million units will almost certainly rise to 1.4 million or so in
the fourth quarter. The rise in starts has been gradual but fairly
steady since the fourth quarter of last year, with the result that
work-put-in-place accelerated in the third quarter by an estimated
$2.3 billion. Owing to a higher proportion of multi-family units,

II -5
the increase in unit outlays and in aggregate dollar expenditures is
expected to be somewhat smaller next quarter than in the period just
ended.
Although the data are still inconclusive, we estimate that
there was little growth in nonfarm inventories in the third quarter,
Dealer's auto stocks fell to minimum levels, and over-all, movements
in manufacturer's and distributor's stocks are believed to be largely
offsetting. At present, total distributor's inventories generally
appear to be in line with sales. The manufacturer's stock-sales ratio,
while apparently having passed a peak, is still high by historical
standards, in large part, however, because of defense-related inventories.
Manufacturers generally appear to be relying on sales increases
to reduce swollen stocks. With prices rising and output expanding, the
time appears to be approaching when business generally may again attempt
to increase inventories. The small accumulation we show in the fourth
quarter indicates a turn-around toward inventory-building, Farm inventories
also are again increasing.
GNP is projected to show little change in fixed nonresidential
investment in the fourth quarter. However, recent private surveys of
intentions to invest in plant and equipment indicate that spending
next year may rise 4 per cent or more above 1967. Another indication
of strength is the continued substantial recovery in new orders for
machinery and equipment in August from the February low. (Defense orders,
in contrast, fell in July and again in August, with the first substantial

reduction in the backlog since the Vietnam build-up began.) However,
owing to the tendency toward bunching of orders for long-lead time
items and the consequent wide fluctuations in this series, the two
months decline in defense orders may not signal any significant change
in trend.
Industrial production. The 2.5 point (1.6 per cent) rise in
industrial production from June to August raised the total index to 158.0
per cent, the same as a year earlier, but one point below the December
1966 high. While increases in output occurred in both final products
and materials, they reflected mainly special situations (see table).

After adjusting roughly for output losses from strikes, sub-
sequent increases from returns to work, and the effect of the Mid-East
crisis on crude oil, the total index apparently shows only a little rise
from February through August. Declines in output in some industries,
in response to top-heavy inventories, would have been just about canceled
out by increased production in some other industries where inventory
adjustments had been largely completed or over-done in some cases.
So far in September, available output data are too skimpy
to accurately judge the underlying trend in industrial production. We
are again faced with two "special" situations: crude oil output is
beginning to drop as rapidly as it rose in July and August and the
strike at Ford continues. If the strike is not settled by the end of
the month, the loss in the total index due to this factor and the
decline in crede oil would amount to about 1.5 points. Output of
steel ingots rose in early September but trade reports indicate some
curtailment in production of steel mill products because of a truck
strike.
Manufacturing utilization rate. The August rate of manufacturing
capacity utilization was estimated at 84.5 per cent, up slightly from an
upward revised 84.2 per cent in July. This is still well below the high
of 91.0 reached in June of last year. Spare capacity exists in a wide
range of industries and is especially noticeable in such materials-
producing industries as textiles, paper, chemicals, steel, and stone,
clay and glass. Aircraft manufacturers continue to operate at unusually
high rates.

Unit auto sales and inventories. Sales of new domestic autos
in the first twenty days of September were down almost one-fourth from the
previous month and 18 per cent from a year earlier. The total stock of
new cars, including unintroduced 1968 models, increased 8 per cent in
the first ten days of September but was one-tenth below a year earlier.
The stock of 1967 models alone was estimated at about 575,000 on
September 10, 30 per cent below the stock of 1966 models on September 10,
1967.
It is estimated that on September 22, Ford's introduction date,
Ford dealers held about 124,000 1967 models and 67,000 1968 models, The
low stock of 1968 =odels should affect Ford Motor Company's sales almost
immediately and the pinch will be acute if the strike extends into
October.
Franchised dealer sales of used cars in the first ten days
of September were down almost one-fifth from last month. A large
decline is usual around introduction dates for new models. However,
early September sales were 7 per cent below a year earlier. In fact,

since August 1 sales have been running below the corresponding period for
every year since 1962. Trade sources report that this year's lower sales
level has been caused mainly by a shortage of clean late-model cars, as
suggested by the strength of used car prices. However, strength in the
used car market appears to be limited to late models. The stock-sales
ratios for all used autos held by franchised dealers for the period
between August 1 and September 10 averaged higher this year than in any
corresponding period of the past decade.
Consumer credit. The proportion of disposable personal
income committed to consumer instalment debt repayment has reversed
the downtrend that began in mid-1966. Latest figures--for the second
quarter of 1967--show the repayments-to-income ratio to be near earlier
high levels, as repayments increased at a faster pace, while the rise
in disposable income slowed.

After a year of approximate stability, the volume of instalment
credit extensions rebounded in June to a new high level, and July was
higher than any previous month except June. However, this rise in
credit extended was not matched by an equal growth in the total amount
of consumer instalment credit outstanding. The change in outstandings
is unlikely to return to the high levels of 1965 for some time, even
if extensions continue to grow rapidly. This is because outstandings
change with the difference between current extensions and repayments
on loans contracted earlier, typically two to three years. Thus,
during extended periods of loan expansion, the rise in repayments may
lag substantially behind current lending. However, the stable level of
extensions from mid-1966 to mid-1967 which was accompanied by rising
repayments sharply reduced the amount of rise in outstandings.
Retail sales. Retail sales rose nearly 1.5 per cent in August,
according to advance estimates based on a partial sample, and were 5.6
per cent above a year earlier. Sales at nondurable goods stores were up
2 per cent, with especially large increases at apparel and general
merchandise stores. Sales in the automotive group and at furniture and
appliance outlets edged off further in August, but total durable goods
sales were unchanged as gains were registered for materials and mis-
cellaneous durable goods.
Retail sales in July and August averaged 2.8 per cent above
the second quarter average, with sales up atall major groupings of stores
except furniture and appliance stores. Nondurables as a group registered
a gain of nearly 2 per cent with an even larger rise at general merchandise
stores.

II -11
Weekly sales data through mid-September suggest continuation
this month of a moderate to large rise in nondurables, particularly
general merchandise, and a further decline at furniture and appliance
stores.
Business inventories, With data (still preliminary) for all
major sectors now in, the book value of business inventories showed only
a slight further decline in July $43 million as compared with a revised
June decrease of $274 million. The June decline is much smaller than
was indicated earlier because of a large upward revision in wholesale
inventories (which now show accumulation rather than liquidation).
Preliminary July figures for wholesalers, however, indicate sizable
liquidation and this, coupled with a moderate further decline in retail
inventories, more than offset accumulation totaling $277 million by
manufacturers.
The table below shows recent monthly changes in total business
inventories, with details for major sectors. As was indicated in the
last Green Book the July rise in manufacturers' inventories was
exaggerated by the spurt in auto producer stocks which apparently
reflected inadequate seasonal allowances. As evidenced by the recent
June revision, the preliminary wholesale figure for July must be taken
with several grains of salt, but the trend of wholesale inventories
appears to have been downward in recent months. This characterization
also applies to retail stocks, with the downward thrust concentrated
at auto dealers. In August and also in September, auto dealer stocks
have apparently continued to decline.

annual rates (in billions of dollars): April, 3.1; May 1.0;
June, -3.3; and July -0.5.
Orders for durables. New orders for durable goods declined
2.3 per cent in August. This marked the second consecutive monthly
decline and brought orders down to a point only 3.5 per cent above the
low of last March. The decline was again centered in the volatile
aircraft sector, which was off 32 per cent. Irregular fluctuations in
aircraft orders have tended to dominate movements in durable goods orders
in recent months.

II -13
New orders for primary metals were down, while fabricated
metals, machinery and other durable goods showed increases. The
special machinery and equipment grouping showed a rise of 4 per cent,
bringing the total increase from the low of last February to 15 per cent.
Unfilled orders for durable goods edged downward 0.5 per cent
in August. This decline followed three consecutive increases. The
main factor was a decrease in order backlogs for aircraft caused
mainly by the sharp drop in new orders. When aircraft are excluded from
the total, the durable backlog was up 0.5 per cent in August, for the
fourth consecutive increase,
Shipments of durable goods edged up 0.4 per cent in August,
with aircraft shipments up 5 per cent and fabricated metals, non-
electrical machinery, and other durable goods showing small increases.
Shipments of primary metals and electrical machinery were down.
Residential construction. Private housing starts, which had
expanded sharply in July, edged upward further in August to the highest
rate since March of 1956. Based on the further improvement already
achieved so far in the third quarter, even if (as seems likely for
technical reasons) some decline develops in September, starts in the
third quarter as a whole will probably average 1.35 million, more than
a tenth higher than in the second quarter of this year. This would be
in addition to an 8 per cent rise from the first to the second quarter.

II -14
Multifamily starts, which--unlike single family--had soared
nearly to the 1965 average in July matched that average in August as
they continued upward. As had been expected, the July surge in the
Northeast states turned out to be much too great to be sustained in
August. However, advances in all other regions--most notably the
West--more than offset this development, as shown in the table.
Seasonally adjusted building permits continued little changed
in August, though at a rate substantially above a year earlier, when
they were still declining. Permits for single family homes increased
moderately in August, while those for multifamily units again edged off.

Some slowing in the rate of expansion in housing starts may
develop in the fourth quarter, partly reflecting the extent of recovery
earlier and partly reflecting pressures on mortgage markets from other
capital market sectors. However, the unusually high level of inflows
of loanable funds which has prevailed so far this year together with
the improved flow of commitments continue to suggest at least some
further uptrend in starts. Also in the case of single family starts,
the still relatively low rate reached in the incomplete recovery thus
far lends further support to the propsect of continued gradual expansion
despite higher mortgage and other costs. And in the case of multifamily
starts, given the underlying strength of demands for rental properties
and the momentum achieved so far this year, further near-term increases
are also likely,
Personal income. Personal income in August rose $4.5 billion
to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $631 billion, 2 per cent above
the second quarter average and more than 7 per cent above a year earlier.
Increases in wages and salaries in August, which totaled $3.5
billion, accounted for the bulk of the rise in total personal income,
as is usual, manufacturing payrolls advanced by $2 billion, the largest
rise in more than five years, The cessation of work stoppages accounted
for some of this large rise in factory payrolls, but increases in
employment other than the return to work of strikers, a longer workweek
and higher pay rates also contributed to the advance.

II -16
A relatively large rise also occurred in farm proprietor's
income, mainly as a result of a step-up in the volume of farm marketings.
August was the second consecutive month of large gain in farm income and
followed several months of little change after a substantial decline in
began almost a year ago. Interest income rose in line with its recent
trend, while other types of income showed little change.
Wage and salary income. The following table shows the large
gains in total wages and salaries since the spring low in nonfarm
employment, and separates the gain between its employment and earnings

Rapid employment growth was the most important factor in
expanding wage and salary disbursements in the private service and
government sectors; in the goods-producing and distribution industries,
there were relatively small employment gains, but these were augmented

II -17
by rapid increases in wage rates, and lengthening of the average workweek.
As a result, nonfarm wages and salaries increased by $38 billion, annual
rate, between May and August as compared with $12 billion in the previous
three months.
With continued rapid increases in wage rates, plus an
accelerated growth of nonfarm employment, wage and salary income
should grow at an even faster rate in the next quarter. Our projections
for the fourth quarter assume a rate of increase of wages and salaries
per employee of about 5-1/2 per cent. In conjunction with an expected
increase in nonfarm jobs of almost 5 per cent, annual rate--barring
protracted auto strikes--this should expand total wages and salaries
at an annual rate of about 10 per cent, or over $40 billion, between
the third and fourth quarters.
Productivity and unit labor costs. Some easing of pressure
on unit labor costs in manufacturing has been evident in the past
several months. The sharp rise in unit labor costs earlier this year
had been a function both of an accelerated rise in wage rates and fringe
costs, and a deterioration in productivity growth which had accompanied
the decline in manufacturing output. Although compensation per
manhour in manufacturing continues to rise at a brisk rate, the increase
since May has been somewhat more moderate than earlier. But this slowdown
is probably temporary and may reflect no more than difficulties with
seasonal adjustment in manufacturing during the period of auto model
changeover. More significant, the rebound of manufacturing output
in July and August has out-paced the increase in employment and hours,

II -18
and productivity in manufacturing picked-up after June. As a result,
unit labor costs in manufacturing in August, at 106.7 per cent of
their 1957-59 average, were at about the same as in June. The average
over-the-year increase of 5 per cent for July-August was down somewhat
from over 5-1/2 per cent earlier this year.

With wage settlements in manufacturngg continuing in the
5-6 per centrange, sharp increases in compensation per manhour may
be anticipated in the months ahead. Manufacturing output is projected
to increase in the fourth quarter--despite the auto strike--and some
increase in overtime at premium pay is likely. But, a recovery in
productivity should be associated with expanding output, and this could
dampen the rate of increase of unit labor costs somewhat, but is not
likely--for the time being--to reverse its upward trend.

II -19
Wholesale prices. The BLS index of wholesale prices of
industrial commodities rose 0.3 per cent from mid-July to mid-August,
as had been estimated a month ago, and increased another 0.2 per
cent by mid-September according to their preliminary estimate. This
pronounced upturn followed 5 months of no change (from February to
July) and a relatively moderate upcreep from mid-1966 to last February.
The August rise was dominated by increased prices for
petroleum and products under the special impetus of the Mid-East
situation, the large boost for rubber products following the wage
settlement in late July, and widespread increases for building materials
and equipment--together these categories accounted for roughly 3/4 of
the rise. Since mid-August, price increases have spread to a wider
variety of materials--steel mill products, copper and brass mill products,
nickel, aluminum container sheet, a number of basic chemicals, and
corrugated boxes--and products, particularly consumer goods (autos,
appliances, color T.V., carpets). A number of the price increases
announced over the past several weeks were to take effect in late
September (after the BLS index pricing date, September 12) and in
October, thus presumably assuring a further rise in the industrial
price index next month. Price increases for the 1968 model autos,
for example, will appear first in the October indexes (WPI and CPI).
Despite the relative concentration by commodity type in
the August increase, all the special FR groupings of the BLS industrial
commodity aggregate showed increases. Thus, average prices of sensitive
industrial materials, which had been drifting down, rose 0.2 per cent,

II -20
with increases in lumber and plywood (the major gain), steel and copper
scrap, silver, and textile fibers more than offsetting further decreases
in hides and rubber. Gains in crude petroleum, miscellaneous "unfinished"
rubber products, and various building materials and equipment other than
lumber and plywood were mainly responsible for the slight rise for "other"
materials, average prices of which had been stable for 3 months. Among
the special groupings, the largest August increase (0.4 per cent) was
for consumer nonfood products, and this rise represented a distinct
acceleration of the upward movement in other recent months. The boosts
in prices for gasoline and consumer rubber products were major
influences on the August increase for this category; in addition there
were increases for apparel, some household durable goods, and photo-
graphic equipment (stemming from the sharp silver price increase).
The price increase for producers' equipment also showed some step-up
in August from the rate prevailing since late winter, but it remained
well below the increases throughout 1966.

II -21
Wholesale prices of farm products and processed foods and
feeds declined about 2 per cent (and the overall wholesale price index
0.4 per cent) in August, as was estimated earlier. There was a sub-
stantial further decline in fresh produce, prices of which had run
up sharply during the late cold, wet spring, bringing them back to
year-earlier levels. Prices of poultry and eggs were also down con-
siderably, and livestock and meat prices were off slightly. Grain
prices continued to recede under the impact of prospective record crops.
In mid-September, according to the BLS preliminary estimate,
the average of farm and food prices was about unchanged from August, and
the rise in industrial prices resulted in a slight (0.1 per cent) increase
in the total wholesale price index.
Consumer prices. In August the consumer price index increased
0.3 per cent, to 116.9 per cent of the 1957-59 average. Food prices
rose contraseasonally, after showing less than the usual large seasonal
rise in July. On an unadjusted basis, food prices increased 1.2 per
cent from June to August and in August--at 116.5 per cent of the 1957-59
average--they were 0.6 per cent above the high reached a year earlier; on
a seasonally adjusted basis the June to August rise amounted to 0.4 per
cent. Prices of non-food commodities continued to rise at a sizable
pace in August, reflecting in part further strength in used car prices
and increased prices (and taxes) for tobacco products. Services also
continued to rise.

II -22
Department of Agriculture Budget in 1967.
Department of Agriculture spending in the past two fiscal
years has been a fourth below 1964 and 1965, largely because favorable
foreign and domestic demands for farm products enabled the Commodity
Credit Corporation to reduce net outlays on income and price stabili-
zation. Net outlays of the USDA amounted to $5.8 billion in fiscal 1967,
$3.5 billion of it spent by the CCC for income stabilization and for
the Food for Peace and other special programs which it operates under
delegated authority. As recently as 1964, the USDA net budget expendi-
ture was $7.9 billion and the CCC coiponent was $5.2 tillion. The Farmers
Home Administration also helped to reduce the net outlays of the USDA
in 1967 by selling participation certificates to private investors and
by pushing programs for insuring loans made by private lenders rather
than their direct loan programs. The ease thus achieved in USDA's
budget permitted some expansion in other agricultural activities, notably
research, conservation of land and water resources, and programs to
increase domestic food consumption. However, it appears that CCC
expenditures will show a rising trend in fiscal 1968, reflecting re-
building of stocks of grains and soybeans from the record 1967 harvests.
Commodity Credit Corporation net expenditure.
In both fiscal 1966 and 1967, strong foreign and domestic
demands not only reduced the need for price support by the CCC but also
enabled it to recoup outlays of earlier years by means of sales of
accumulated stocks. In the two years ending on June 30, 1967, the value
of inventories owned by the CCC, mainly grains, was reduced from $3.9

II -23
billion to $1.9 billion, and commodities under price support loans
were reduced from $2.5 billion to $1.5 billion.

Substantial net receipts earned on grain and cotton operations in 1967
are shown in column 1 of the table. These receipts cushioned the effect
of a boost of nearly a billion dollars, to $2.5 billion, in direct
payments for price support and for acreage diversion.
The 1967 budget expenditure is the first to reflect the full
effect of the new farm policy provided by the Act of 1965 concerning
the crop years, 1966-70. Under this policy, commodity loan and inventory
operations are de-emphasized as a means of price and income support.
Instead, producers of feed grains, wheat, and cotton are offered payments
to divert a specified part of their allotted acreages from production
in any year. Price support is available to cooperating producers in
a combination of loans and payments with loan rates low enough to be
consistent with world prices supplemented by payments. This move toward
supply-management, with acreage diversion and price support payments
as principal tools and loan and inventory operations in a less vital
role, was authorized in 1965, but it has been tested in the feed grain
programs since 1961, and in wheat since 1964. It was applied to cotton
for the first time in 1966,
The new Food for Peace legislation enacted in November 1966
completes the move in national food policy away from one oriented to
surplus disposal to one more nearly oriented to planned production.
The Act now requires the under-developed countries to undertake specified
measures to increase their own agricultural production. It also stresses
development of cash markets and seeks to encourage countries buying our

II -25
products with foreign currencies to switch to dollar purchases by 1971.
An enlarged and more flexible long-term credit program is provided to
assist them. Larger provisions are made for donations.
Obviously, the new program could have accounted for only a
small part of the 12 per cent decline in the fiscal 1967 budget
expenditures from a year earlier. Reduced export availabilities of
dairy products and wheat affected the 1967 budget more. Wheat, the
most important commodity exported under Food for peace programs, was
a smaller proportion in 1967 than in preceding years. Other grains
were substituted for wheat where possible in 1967. India accepted
sorghum grain and corn for feeding portions of her population accustomed
to using these grains for food.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL SITUATION
Bank credit. Outstanding bank credit appears to have
expanded only moderately in early September, following a sharp jump at
the end of August associated with the Treasury's $2.5 billion note
financing. Mainly in response to this financing, the credit proxy rose
sharply in the week ending September 6, and then declined slightly,
both before and after adjustment for foreign branch borrowing, in the
ensuing two weeks. Credit at weekly reporting banks, after allowance
for usual seasonal movements, showed little net change in the two weeks
ending September 13. At nonweekly reporting banks, however, total loans
and investments rose more in the first half of September than in the
comparable period of any other recent year, with the increased growth
mainly in Government securities.
A slackening in credit growth is not an unusual development
in periods immediately following a Treasury financing, when partici-
pants in the underwriting are redistributing some of their acquisitions
of the new securities. Continued moderation in loan demand at city
banks also tended to limit their credit expansion, and at the same
time, contributed to some further increase in holdings of investments,
mainly in Treasury bills and short-term municipals. Some of this
increase may have been in response to the favorable spread in recent
weeks between the Federal funds rate and other short-term yields.
During the first two weeks of September, outstanding business
loans at city banks, after allowance for usual seasonal changes, declined

III -2
substantially further. The cumulative decline in these loans from the
beginning of the liquidation in late July through mid-September totaled
about $1-3/4 billion, offsetting most of the June-July increase. A
weaker trend has been evident in virtually every industry category.
Earlier, it had been most evident in the metals, petroleum, chemicals
and mining groups; more recently, it has been more pronounced in the
seasonally oriented industries. In early September, outstanding loans
to food processors and trade concerns declined contraseasonally and
those to commodity dealers rose less than usual.
Business demands for bank financing continued light over the
mid-September tax and dividend period. At New York City banks, total
financing associated directly and indirectly with tax and dividend
payments was lower than in any other recent year, as shown in the
table.

Bank deposits. Net inflows of time and savings deposits
at commercial banks slackened considerably in early September after
expanding at an average annual rate of about 16 per cent in July and
August. The major factor accounting for this abrupt change in pace
was the sizable September run-off in CD's following sharp expansion
over July and August. The $300 million decline at all weekly report-
ing banks in the 2 weeks ending September 13, while only three-fifths
as large as last year's forced run-off, was in contrast with increases
in the comparable weeks of other recent years, and was followed by a
sizable tax-related run-off at New York and Chicago banks in the week
ending September 20. This change in trend probably reflects reduced
bank interest in expanding CD's, in view of recent weakness in loan
demand and the resulting moderation of expected demands over the
remainder of the year. In addition, acceleration of some withheld tax
payments into the early-September period may have reduced the volume of
corporate funds available for purchase of money market instruments.
Another factor influencing the trend in time and savings
deposit growth over the past two months has been a slackening in growth
of consumer-type savings at city banks. Following reversal of the
downtrend early in February, savings deposits expanded rapidly until
July. Between mid-July and mid-September, however, the average weekly
rise fell to less than half the volume in the preceding 6-1/2 months,
as shown in the table. The inflow of other consumer-type deposits
also slackened somewhat recently, but less than passbook savings.

The recent slowdown in savings deposits probably has been associated
in part with increases in rates and promotional activity on consumer-
type CD's at city banks over the summer months, as well as with the
substantial rise in yields on short- and intermediate-term market
securities. At country banks, where depositors generally are less
interest-sensitive and where rates on consumer-type time instruments
have changed little, inflows of passbook savings continue large.
The growth surge in the money stock, which had been at an
annual rate of 11 per cent from April through August, came to an abrupt
halt in September. It now appears that the September average will show
little change from August. So far this year, growth has been at an
annual rate of close to 7 per cent.
A relatively large share of the recent monetary expansion
was in demand deposits at city banks, and presumably reflected a major
adjustment in holdings of cash balances by large corporations as well

III -5
as growth in those of individuals. In part, this adjustment appears
to have been associated with expanding income and increased transactions
needs, since debits to demand deposits at banks outside New York City
rose at an annual rate of 30 per cent between May and August. It also
may have reflected upward adjustment of balances by some corporations,
either in response to increased banker pressure to maintain balances
that compensate for services rendered or voluntarily to improve bank
relations in view of growing expectations that availability of funds
might become restricted again next year.
U. S. Government securities market. Yields have risen in all
sectors of the U. S. Government securities market since early September
and have reached new highs for the year in the intermediate and long-
term maturity areas. Bill rates have risen on balance but most recently
have receded from their peaks.

In the bill market, yield advances in large part reflected
market anticipation of sizable new bill issues to finance the Treasury's
large fourth quarter cash needs. On September 22, the Treasury announced
the sale of $4.5 billion of April and June tax bills, and also a further
cycle of $100 million additions to the weekly 3-month bill auction, which
would raise $1.3 billion of new cash beginning in early October.
Net demand for bills was tempered in this period not only by
prospective additions to supply, but also by business needs to make
September dividend and tax payments. In addition, the market had to
absorb sizable bill sales by a Federal Agency. Most recently, bill
rates have edged off their peaks, reflecting in part the re-entry of
the System in the market as a large seasonal buyer of bills.
On balance, bill yields have risen 10 to 25 basis points
since the Labor Day week-end. The 3-month bill reached a new peak for
the year of 4.60 per cent at the time of the Treasury's cash financing
announcement, and the 1-year bill rose to 5.19 per cent. With pressures
developing in the bill market, other short-term rates also rose.
Although increases have not yet spread to all sectors of the short-term
market, yields on negotiable certificates of deposit, bankers' accept-
ances, and 6-month Federal Agency issues have risen 10 to 15 basis
points as the table shows,

Yields on Treasury notes and bonds have also risen, bringing
them to new highs for the year in all maturity areas, and in the long-
term area to levels above the 1966 peaks. For the most part these
increases appear to have represented a sympathetic reaction to the bill
market. Customer activity has generally been light, although there
were scattered reports of some selling of longer-term issues on swaps
into relatively high-yieldin- corporate issues. However, dealers were
able to lighten their holdings of 1-5 year issues further, though at
declining prices. Such positions were reduced by $250 million to $125
million over the past three weeks. Dealer holdin s of bonds due in1967

more than 5 years have declined slightly since the first week of
September and currently total about $30 million. In this period the
System bought $75 million of coupon issues.
The upward yield adjustments in the Government market led to
the recent $400 million 3-year FNMA debentures being priced to yield
5.82 per cent. While some Agency yields have risen recently, the yield
spread of Agency issues over comparable maturities of direct Treasury
debt has remained within a normal range, as banks and other institutional
investors have thus far continued to have an ample supply of investible
funds.
Federal budgets and finance. The upward interest rate
pressures in the U. S. Government securities market are basically the
result of the very large deficit in the Federal budget (no matter what
the concept) that has developed for fiscal 1968. As the figures in
column 4 of Table A show, the Administrative budget deficit was estimated
at only around $8 billion at the time of the January budget document,
and smaller deficits were projected for the cash and national accounts
budget. These earlier projections included the effect on receipts of a
6 per cent tax surcharge assumed effective mid-1967. Since that time,
official forecasts of the budget deficit have ballooned, in part because
the original tax program was not enacted, in part because the original
receipts estimates proved too optimistic oven with the existing tax
structure, and in part because spending is headed for higher levels.

III -9
Principally because of uncertainties about spending, a
number of budget forecasts for fiscal 1968 were shown or implicit in
the Budget Bureau's "Summer Review of the 1968 Budget." Under the
existing tax structure, one budget forecast based on the figures in
the Summer Review would indicate an Administrative budget deficit of
$23 billion, as shown in column 3 of Table A. On the spending side
such a deficit assumes spending of $139 billion, or $4 billion in
excess of expenditures projected in the January document. This figure
in turn assumes that defense spending will be $4 billion over its
January projections, but that civilian expenditures will be unchanged
from the level expected in January. Since some relatively predetermined
civilian expenditures are now estimated to be $1.5 billion above the
January level, this contingency requires a discretionary cut in other
civilian expenditures of the same amount.
The proposed tax program would reduce the budget deficits by
$6 or $7 billion, depending on the particular budget measure. It would
reduce the Ldmini::Lative deficit to $16.5 billion, the cash deficit to
$14 billion, and the national accounts deficit to $9 billion--all still
substantially higher than the original January projection for fiscal
1968. All deficits would also be above fiscal 1967 levels, but only
slightly so in case of the national accounts measure.
The prospects of obtaining a 10 per cent tax surcharge
effective July 1 for corporationsand October 1 for individuals now
appear slight. The quarterly budget figures shown through the fourth

III -10
quarter of calendar year 1967 in Table B assume no tax increase
affecting receipts in the fourth quarter and show expenditures over
the short run as they appear to the staff at the moment.
These figures indicate an enlargedcash deficit in the
fourth quarter. For the second half of calendar 1967, they indicate
net cash to be raised by the Treasury of around $19 billion, including
P.C. sales if the necessary legislation is passed. This implies that
there will be a slight amount of Treasury borrowing in the first half
of 1968 if taxes are not increased--which compares with net cash repay-
ment of $11 billion in the corresponding half of 1967. Thus far, net
cash borrowing of about $14 billion has taken place or been announced.

Corporate and municipal bond markets. Yields on new and
recently offered corporate bonds are still slightly below their forty-
year highs reached near the end of August. But the yield series for
new bonds, shown in the yield table, overstates the extent of the
decline due to a changing mix in the types of issues averaged. More-
over, some recent new corporate issues initially offered at reduced
yields have since adjusted higher in the secondary market, following
the termination of unsuccessful syndicates. While municipal yields
have changed little on balance since late August, most recently they
too have shown some tendency to edge higher.

Uncertainty over the future course of fiscal and monetary
policies continues to be a dominant factor in the bond markets, and
this uncertainty has led to a notable lack of success on the part of
underwriters who attempted to lead the market down in the first half
of September. Several corporate issues priced aggressively in September
either remain in syndicate with sizable unsold balances or have adjusted
upward in yield after the termination of syndicate price restrictions.
One such issue, the $75 million Aaa-rated New York Telephone and
Telegraph Company bonds with 5-year call protection, was offered on
September 6 at 5.95 per cent. With only about 40 per cent sold, the
bonds were released to free market trading and adjusted upward to 6.04
per cent. This yield compares with a 6.10 per cent yield reached on a
similar telephone bond when it was releasedfrom syndicate in late
August. Municipal underwriters have experienced similar investor
resistance to aggressive pricing.
The significant recent cut-back in the forward calendar of
new corporate offerings, first evident early in September, accounted
for the relative optimism that developed among corporate underwriters
at the time. It now appears that public bonds offered in September
will total slightly less than $1 billion, little more than half of the
August total. Over-all bond and stock volume, estimated at $1.8 billion
for September including private placements, is some $700 million below
August.
The reduced volume of publicly offered bonds is expected to
continue in October, since recent additions to the calendar have declined

III -15
both in frequency and average size. Thus, the $500 million or so now
definitely scheduled for October may build up to no more than $900
million, by month end. And an increase in stock offerings is expected
to offset much of the reduced volume of bonds. Thus, the total volume
of bonds and stocks may remain at or about the $1.8 billion September
level.

State and local government security offerings in September
are ultimately expected to aggregate more than $1.3 billion, or nearly
30 per cent above September 1966. Many of the issues offered so far
have not sold well; consequently, underwriters' advertised and unad-
vertised inventories have advanced since the beginning of the month.
October offerings are currently estimated at about $1 billion--still
well in excess of the year ago experience, but if yields on municipal
bonds were to rise further, some of this prospective volume might be
cut back or deferred.

Corporate finance. More complete data on second quarter
corporate profits confirm earlier staff estimates of a further decline
in manufacturing profits and profit margins. According to FTC-SEC
estimates, total profits before taxes of manufacturing corporations
were 10 per cent smaller than in the second quarter of 1966, following
a year-to-year decline of 8 per cent in the first quarter. However,
the Department of Commerce estimate of profits of all corporations
shows almost no change, seasonally adjusted, from the first to the
second quarter, because the decline for manufacturing companies was
offset by an estimated increase in the profits of "all other" industries.
("All other" includes construction, mining, services, and--the largest
component by far--retail and wholesale trade.)

Data on current assets and liabilities of corporations at the
end of the second quarter, which have also just become available, show
little increase in corporate net working capital over the quarter and a
further decline in corporate liquidity (as measured by the ratio of cash,
deposits and U.S. Government securities to total current liabilities).
The slowdown in economic activity and accelerated income tax payments
contributed to these developments. With growth in accounts receivable
much smaller than usual, inventory accumulation moderate, and reduction
in liquid assets exceptionally large, total current assets rose less
than one-tenth as much as in the second quarter of last year. Total
current liabilities, which have increased on the average about $5 billion
in other second quarters, declined slightly this year because of the
large drop in accrued tax liabilities.

Though it may not be readily apparent in the unusually large
reduction in liquid assets and the continued decline in the conventional
liquidity ratio, working capital changes in the second quarter lend
support to the view that the large volume of long-term financing under-
taken by corporations in the period bolstered their liquidity. The
decline in liquid assets, while substantial by historical standards,
was much smaller than the drop in accrued tax liabilities; that is,
liquid asset holdings--net of accrued tax liabilities--actually
increased considerably. In effect, corporations paid accelerated tax
liabilities out of long-term financing. Had corporations relied lesse

III -19
heavily on long-term funds and more heavily on liquid assets or short-
term bank loans, net working capital would have contracted and the
conventional liquidity ratio would have been even lower.

III -20
Stock market, Since the end of August, and especially
since Labor Day, both stock prices and stock volume have risen
sharply, reactivating the general concern about speculative activity
that was evident at mid-summer. Prices on both the New York and
American Stock Exchanges are currently at their all-time highs.
Compared with the previous peak in early August, the New York Stock
Exchange and Standard and Poor's 500 indexes are up about 2 per cent,
and the American Exchange index is up 5 per cent. Trading activity
on the New York Exchange, which had dropped from 12.1 million shares,
per day in the first week of August to 7.2 million shares per day
by month end, was up again last week to an average of 11.3 million
shares per day. On the American Stock Exchange recent increases in
activity have been even more pronounced; while the ratio of AMEX to
NYSE volume had dropped to a temporary low of 44 per cent early in
September, by last week it had advanced again to 51 per cent.
An examination of industry stock price movements since the
end of July shows that the New York Exchange's recent advance has been
fairly broad based; it has not centered on the so-called "glamour"
stocks. Rather, if anything, it would appear that investors have
put special stress on what are regarded as relatively "under-valued"
issues--issues which did not fully participate in the earlier advance.
A distribution of issues on the American Exchange by price-earnings
ratios would suggest a similar conclusion. The number selling at
multiples from 0 to 10 declined from 116 in July to 91 in August while

III -21
the number selling at multiples of 10 to 30 increased from 531
to 554. The number selling at 30 times earnings or more remained
constant.
Although stock market credit advanced again in August to
a new high, its rate of growth moderated slightly further. Debt in
margin accounts had expanded $260 million in June, but it rose only
half that much in July (following a downward revision of $50 million
in the initial estimate), and in August the increase was $100 million.
Over the somewhat longer period since January, when the series reached
a temporary seasonal low, margin debt has grown $810 million. A
decline of about $150 million in credit balances held in special
miscellaneous accounts during August suggests that existing margin
customers recommitted some reserve purchasing power to the market
while prices were declining.

III -22
Mortgage markets. Secondary market yields on FHA-insured
home mortgages increased further in August. But because yields on new
issues of high-grade corporate bonds increased even more, the already
small yield margin of FHA loans over bonds was reduced to one of the
narrowest differentials--only 71 basis points--of the postwar period.
The margin in August was 55 basis points below its recent high in
February. The narrow margin since this winter accounts in part for
the heavy continued investment by savings banks in corporate bonds and
also for the unusual volatility of FHA mortgage yields.
In contrast to the record inflows of savings to mortgage
lenders since spring, borrower demands have apparently remained more
moderate, and as a result the rise in mortgage yields has been limited.
One factor that has apparently restrained credit demands has been the
increase in discounts on FHA (and VA) loans; these exceeded 5 points in
August. Such discounts have continued to deter some would-be sellers
from offering houses which require this liberal type of financing, inas-
much as home sellers by regulation must absorb all but 1.0 point of the
discount. This, in turn, has contributed to hesitancy on the part of
some builders to undertake production for sale with Government under-
written mortgages, and to a shortage in some areas of local listings
of existing homes for sale.

Sec. 203 loans.
During August, interest rates on conventional home mortgages
(FHA series) also edged higher for new homes but remained unchanged at
their higher July level for existing homes (not shown in the table).
While both types of rates were close to year earlier levels, average
loan-to-value ratios and maturities on conventional first mortgage
loans continued to be made on more liberal terms than in August 1966,
and average loan amounts were again sharply higher on both new and
existing homes. Prices of conventionally financed homes have increased
over the past year even more in absolute terms than average loan size
and thus, implied downpayments (price minus amount of first mortgage)
also rose further in August. Such downpayments averaged $6,100 on
existing houses and $7,000 on new ones.

III -24
For savings and loan apsociations--whichlhave regained their
dominant position in the mortgage market--the tempo of lending picked
up further in August as net savings inflows continued strong. In
August for the first time this year, S&L mortgage closings nearly
matched the volume during the same month of 1965, which was a relatively
normal year. S&L outstanding mortgage commitments also rose further and
by the end of August slightly exceeded their 1965 level. (All compari-
sons include an allowance for changes in loans in process.)
The number of nonfarm mortgage foreclosures during the
second quarter of 1967 increased only about seasonally--after changing
little during 1966. In other recent years, foreclosures had been
rising relatively sharply although at a declining pace. The foreclosure
rate, which remained virtually unchanged, was the lowest for this quarter
since 1963.

Savings flows to depositary-ype intermediaries. During
August savings accounts at the nation's savings and loan associations
and mutual savings banks continued to grow nearly as much as in earlier
peak years, as the table shows. When these data are adjusted roughly
for seasonal influences, however, they suggest some moderation in the
rate of savings growth relative to earlier months this year.
Only fragmentary data are available thus far on September
savings flows. But in the first half of the month, net flows to the
15 largest savings banks in New York City were a new record. Moreover,
for the month as a whole, net savings growth at both mutuals and S&L's
will be augmented because these institutions will be crediting third
quarter interest payments at higher average rates than previously and
on a larger volume of savings than has ever existed before.

The recent further advance of short-term market rates has
significantly increased rate spreads favoring market securities over
claims at thrift institutions. As a result, spreads favoring rates
on short- and intermediate-term Government securities are now about
as large as in June 1966, as the table shows. On the other hand,
spreads favoring rates on commercial paper and short-term agency issues--
which had been so much more attractive than those on Treasury issues
in mid-1966--are still considerably smaller.

Despite the currently higher short-term rates, members of
the thrift industry do not seem to anticipate any serious problems
with their savings inflows during October. In part, this probably

over savings rates relative to 1966, as well as the less aggressive
competition of commercial banks for consumer-type savings accounts this
year. In addition, it may reflect a judgment that accounts outstanding
today may be less interest sensitive than those outstanding last year.
Much of the interest sensitive money which left non-bank
intermediaries last year has apparently not returned. Among New York
State savings banks alone, accounts of $50,000 or more due to charitable
and religious organizations fell from $433 million in December 1965 to
about $150 million in mid-summer 1966, when the deposit rate was raised
to 5 per cent. Since then, this balance has shown little change. While
comparable data are not available for S&L's, the proportion of out-of-
state share capital of State-chartered California S&L's did decrease
during 1966 and has remained fairly stable thus far in 1967, suggesting
that the same type of behavior may be present.

reduced their total indebtedness to $4.2 billion, a decline of $3.3
billion since the July 1966 peak and the lowest level of indebtedness
in well over three years. Over the same period, the Home Loan Bank

U.S. balance of payments. Recent reports indicate that
the third quarter liquidity deficit will be somewhat larger than
indicated by earlier preliminary data, so that the change from the
second quarter results may not be significant. The deficit for July
and August taken together, before seasonal adjustment, was about
$860 million, and after an estimated allowance for seasonal factors
this would be reduced to perhaps $360 million. The earlier weeks of
September showed modest surpluses, but these were more than offset
by a large deficit in the week ended September 20. If there is also
a deficit in the remainder of the month, the outcome for the quarter
would be similar to the published deficit of somewhat over $1/2
billion per quarter in the first half.
As discussed below, the second quarter was adversely
affected by temporary factors that may have amounted, on balance,
to $400 million. Such factors were probably very much smaller in
the third quarter as the Middle East disturbances abated. However,
the high second quarter deficit was reduced by the placement of $605
million of foreign official dollar holdings into deposits with a
maturity of over one year (line 21 of the Appendix B table) while
similar investments so far in the third quarter have been negligible.
On the other hand, the third quarter recorded deficit probably
benefited from the pressures on sterling. Taking such special or
temporary factors into account there probably has not been a sig-
nificant shift from the underlying deficit rate of about $3.0 billion
since the middle of last year.

IV -2
Measured on the official reserve transactions basis a
surplus of over $1/2 billion (after rough seasonal adjustment) was
achieved in July-August as U.S. banks increased their liabilities
to their foreign branches. This balance may therefore show a
sizable surplus for the quarter as a whole, even though liabilities
to branches have moved irregularly since the end of August, first
being reduced and then tending to rise after the middle of September.
Banking claims. In August banks reported a net increase
of about $100 million in claims on foreigners, equally divided
between short-term and long-term claims. However, much of this
activity reflected repurchases of loans from foreign branches and
there may also have been some temporary placing of funds abroad at
the end of the month. There was some seasonal reduction in claims
on Japan.
Merchandise trade. The U.S. foreign trade surplus increased
substantially in August as imports fell sharply. For the two months
of July and August combined, the surplus, on a balance of payments
basis, was at an annual rate of $4.5 billion, about the same as in
the second quarter.
August exports may be understated by about $50 million
because of the omission of certain export documents. If adjusted
for this, exports in August would show a moderate increase both
over July and over the high rate of the first six months of the
year, and the trade surplus in July-August would rise to an
annual rate of $4.7 billion.

IV -3
The pattern of exports in July-August varied only slightly
from that of the second quarter. Shipments of agricultural products
remained low, and sales of nonagricultural commodities continued
strong. Exports to Japan and Western Europe held at the second
quarter rate, but shipments to Canada and Asian countries drifted
downward. Exports to Latin America were somewhat above those of
the second quarter.
The effects of the Arab-Israeli war were still evident in
the August trade data. U.S. exports of crude petroleum were still
high. Shipments to the United Kingdom expanded further but deliveries
to other Western European countries and Canada, also high in July,
were virtually nil in August. Imports of crude oil from Canada con-
tinued high in August while those from Venezuela were considerably
below last year's rate. U.S. total exports to the Arab countries
in August were slightly greater than the low July value, as
shipments to Libya returned to previous rates.
Imports dropped by about 5 per cent from July to August.
However, after a similar drop from April to May imports recovered
to their previous high level. For July and August combined, imports
were at an annual rate of $26.2 billion, slightly below the second
quarter rate. Recent increases in industrial production and
personal income can be expected to strengthen demands for imported
products in the months ahead.
Imports of foods, automotive products and other nonfood
consumer goods in July-August stabilized at the second quarter rates,

IV -4
while the downtrend in industrial materials continued, particularly
in nonferrous metals, and, as described above, crude petroleum.
With the improvement in housing starts and the firming in
domestic textile production, imports of building supplies and textile
materials grew moderately in July-August. Arrivals of iron and steel-
mill products expanded further, approaching the record value of the
third quarter of 1966.
Imports of machinery, which had slipped in the second
quarter, recovered sharply in July-August. Japan and the Common
Market countries were the principal suppliers of these expanded
deliveries.
Second quarter accounts. More complete accounts for the
second quarter balance of payments (see appendix B) identify several
causes for that quarter's large deficit, most of them temporary:
larger than normal net travel expenditures were connected with
Expo 67 in Canada (perhaps $150 million, including an allowance
for some reduction in U.S. tourist receipts), remittances and bond
sales proceeds to Israel ($150 million), and a total of unidentified
net payments that seems to be at least $300 million higher than the
quarterly average of recent years. There were also some temporary
plus factors that helped the second quarter balance, including
(1) special debt repayments by Canada ($30 million) and earlier
than scheduled repayments in local currency of loans to Viet Nam,
which were then used to pay for some current military expenditures
in that country, and (2) cash received from the liquidation of

IV -5
direct foreign investments (about $45 million) and a return flow of
over $50 million from a Canadian subsidiary of a short-term advance
made by the U.S. parent company near the end of 1966. On balance,
such temporary factors may have worsened the second quarter balance
by some $400 million.
The principal new information on the second quarter balance
of payments relates to direct investment outflows; these are reported
at $684 million in the second quarter (seasonally adjusted), only
slightly above the first quarter total. The first half outflow this
year is about $300 million lower than the amount in the same period
of 1966. Most of this difference is associated with a few large
transactions, however, rather than with a generalized decline. In
the second quarter this year there were the cash inflows from liqui-
dations mentioned above, and in addition there were recorded inflows
of $145 million from Latin America (Chile and Mexico) representing
the sale of properties against payments in notes. The notes appear
as a major item of long-term portfolio outflow in the quarter. In
the case of Chilean properties, the notes received from the Government
of that country will be reinvested in Chilean copper production as
needed for that purpose. Without these receipts, the second quarter
outflow would have been at an annual rate of about $3.5 billion,
about the same as the rate in 1965 or 1966.
Other features of the second quarter accounts were an
unusually small increase in military expenditures abroad raising
the total to an annual rate of about $4.2 billion, some slippage

IV -6
of income from direct investments to an annual rate of $3.9 billion
compared to an average of $4.1 billion in the previous four quarters,
and a sizable drop in net Government grants and credits from the
temporarily inflated rate of the first quarter. Some of the reduction
in Government outlays was in AID programs for Pakistan and Viet Nam,
and the net outflow was also reduced by the repayment from Viet Nam
noted above. Net credit extensions by the Export-Import Bank were
higher, partly to finance exports of aircraft.

IV -7 -
U.K. balance of payments. Britain failed td achieve the
hoped-for surplus in its basic balance--on current and long-tertt
capital transactions--during the first half of 1967. Instead,
there was a recorded deficit of L57 million, and only a small sur-
plus even if one allows for the possibility that some part of the
exceptionally large positive errors and omissions item of L243
million may have represented unidentified current earnings. (Most
of that time is thought to have represented unrecorded short-term
capital inflows.)
The surplus on service transactions increased substantially
during the first half year, as earlier special tax payments to oil
countries and insurance payments for hurricane damage in North America
ceased, and as the U.K. restrictions on travel spending imposed in
July 1966 took increasing effect. On long-term capital, there was
a small net inflow (even apart from credits received from the U.S.
Export-Import Bank to finance imports of military aircraft), in
contrast to earlier outflows. Thus, the major disappointment occurred
in merchandise trade. The trade deficit was about L150 million,
seasonally adjusted, in the first half of 1967; most of this was
incurred in the second quarter, when the deficit was the largest
since the second quarter of 1965.
The trend of U.K. foreign trade has been unusually difficult
to analyze during the past year because of the dock strike of May-
June 1966, the removal--announced in advance--of import surcharges

IV -8 -
at the end of November 1966, and the Middle East crisis of mid-
1967. However, trade data for the latest four months combined--
May through August--appear to be relatively free from erratic
disturbances apart from some curtailment of fuel imports, and
these are compared in the table below with data for January-April
1966--the period just before the 1966 dock strike--in order to
provide some appraisal of trends.
It will be seen that merchandise imports rose less than
2 per cent in value from January-April 1966 to May-August 1967 (and
by about the same amount at constant prices), and would have risen
by only about 3 per cent if fuel imports had not been curtailed by
the Middle East crisis in the latter period. This advance is modest,
about equal to that in real GNP, and includes the effect of the
removal of import surcharges on manufactured goods, where the
import increase has since been concentrated.
Thus, it appears that the main disappointment with the
trade performance should be focused on exports. These were up
only 3-1/2 per cent over the period, having first risen and then
declined. Exports to Western Europe--particularly to EEC countries--
and to North America were actually lower in the latest four-month
period than in early 1966. Exports to sterling area countries,
though still higher than in early 1966, have fallen off recently.
Some portion of these declines was attributable to cyclical weakness

of demand in the United States and in major European countries.
Thus, Britain's most recent export difficulties have included
a temporary element.
On the other hand, however, domestic demand in Britain
has also been cyclically weak, helping to hold down imports.
There are now signs that a recovery is getting under way. Man-
ufacturing output increased in both June and July; by July it had
regained about three-fourths of the 5 per cent drop that took
place between July 1966 and November 1966, the low point. Unemploy-
ment, seasonally adjusted, did not change much in September, after
rising steadily earlier.
Further recovery in demand and output is to be expected,
particularly in light of recent and prospective Government efforts
to give some stimulus to economic activity. Installment credit
restrictions were eased in June and in August. The payment of
regional employment premiums, of accelerated investment grants,
and of larger social welfare benefits, will be added to the spending
stream starting this fall. The stimulus intended is only moderate.
The Government's goal is a 3 per cent rate of growth in real GNP
(as compared with the 4 per cent target announced in 1965); that
is all the Government feels it can allow and still give adequate
priority to the balance of payments. But even moderate domestic
growth is likely to start imports rising again. Hence, very substantial
recovery and growth in exports is needed if the basic payments balance

IV -11 -
is to generate a sufficient surplus to pay off the short- and
medium-term foreign debts that fall due from now through 1970.
This will require not only a sharp pick-up in foreign demand, but
also an ending of the gradual decline in Britain's share of world
exports, which continued at least through 1966.
Prices and wages in industrial countries. The economic
slowdown experienced by most industrial countries since mid-1966 has
been reflected in price and wage movements. Price and wage increases
have been slowed by an easing of demand pressures and by deliberate
government policies to hold the line on such increases.
Wholesale prices have increased less during the past year
than a year earlier in every industrial country, as shown in the
table below. In several countries--France, Germany, Italy, and
Switzerland--wholesale prices have in fact declined thus far in 1967.

As is typical, consumer prices have risen more than whole-
sale prices. However, in several countries--the United Kingdom,
Germany, the Netherlands, and Japan--consumer price advances have been
smaller this year than earlier (see table). Only Italy and Canada
have experienced a significant acceleration. For all countries, price
increases for food have been smaller than for non-food items, and
also smaller than a year earlier, thereby moderating somewhat the
advance in total consumer prices. In several large countries Germany,
Britain, and Japan--consumer price increases have been smaller than
in the United States.

IV -13 -
Slackened economic activity has not had as clear an
impact on wages as on prices. This is partly because of lags in
implementing new labor contracts and partly the result of cost-
of-living adjustments. For Germany and the United Kingdom, for which
the recent economic slowdown was most pronounced, as well as for
the Netherlands and Belgium, the rate of increase in wage rates has
diminished significantly. In Canada, Italy, and Sweden, on the
other hand, wage increases have accelerated in 1967.
Price and wage advances in the United Kingdom thus far in
1967 have been much smaller than for the comparable 1966 period.
The change reflects the restrictive government program introduced
in July 1966, although the reduction of demand pressures also has
had some effect. With the expiration of a period of "severe restraint"
at the end of June, wage rates jumped sharply in July, as increases
that had been deferred earlier were put into effect. The wholesale
price index has shown no significant change since mid-1966.
In Germany, the recession has brought an easing of price
and wage increases. In fact, wholesale prices of industrial products
have declined; in July they were 1-1/2 per cent lower than a year
earlier. Also, consumer prices have risen more slowly this year than
before, increasing only 1-1/2 per cent during the year to July partly
as a result of higher indirect taxes. Wage rate increases have been
somewhat lower thus far in 1967 than last year, kept down both by smaller
negotiated increases and by postponement of new wage negotiations

IV -14 -
by some unions. But with the government's anti-recession policies
now taking effect, more rapid wage and price increases may be forth-
coming.
In France, wholesale prices appear to have responded to the
slack in the economy, having shown a sizable decline of 1-1/2 per cent
in the year to July. Consumer prices for non-food items have, on the
other hand, shown a somewhat more rapid rate of increase this year than
last, partly because of statutory price increases authorized by the
government in July 1967, including increases in transportation fares
in the Paris region, gas and electricity charges, and rents. Despite
reduced demand pressures and increasing unecpl6yment, wage rate increases-
have continued this year at about last year's rate of nearly 6 per cent.
Italy in contrast to other European countries, has continued
to experience rapid economic expansion this year, and increases in consumer
prices and in wage rates have accelerated, although wholesale prices
have declined. The rise in consumer prices for non-food items was
5.7 per cent in the year to July 1967, more than in any other industrial
country. This rise has contributed to an acceleration of wage increases
through sliding scale arrangements. But also, union wage demands have
been stronger.
In Canada, despite some slackening in activity, consumer
prices and wage rates have been rising at an increasing rate during
the past year, although the rise in wholesale prices has slowed. Cost-
push factors at work in the economy include efforts by some unions to
lift wages to U.S. levels.

APPENDIX A: REVISIONS IN BANK CREDIT SERIES*
The seasonally adjusted series for total bank credit and its
major components have been revised to reflect changes in seasonal
factors for recent years. In addition to these changes which have
smoothed the month-to-month fluctuations in the series, benchmark
adjustments have reduced somewhat the levels of total loans and of1/
total loans and investments in 1966 and in the first half of 1967.-
Revisions in seasonal factors reflect primarily the changing
behavior of bank loans and investments associated with shifts in the
pattern of tax payments to the Treasury./ These shifts have had their
greatest impact on bank credit movements over only the past year and a
half, a period too short to justify much confidence in current seasonal
factors computed by the usual procedures. However, in view of the fact
that the Treasury's various programs for accelerating tax payments to
a pay-as-you-go basis are substantially changing seasonal demands for
bank credit, an attempt has been made to take account of the observed
changes in bank credit that appear to be related to the repetitive
aspects of these shifts.
While the acceleration of corporate income tax payments
initially resulted in a nonseasonal doubling up of payments in the
March-June period, completion of this program establishes 5 major
corporate income tax payment dates--the 15th of March, April, June,
September, and December--around which seasonal demands for bank credit
should be large. April 15 replaces March 15 as a major payment date
for the estimated first quarter tax liability. June 15 remains a
regular payment date for second quarter liabilities, and additional
payments due on unpaid liabilities accrued in the prior year make the
*Prepared by Edward R. Fry and Mary F. Weaver, Banking Section,
Division of Research and Statistics.
1/ The December 1966 call report indicated that interbank loans, which
are excluded from total loans adjusted, were larger than estimated
earlier, so the estimated monthly levels of loans adjusted were
reduced accordingly.
2/ Changes in Treasury financing patterns, such as the shift from
quarterly to monthly auctions of 1-year bills in 1963 and the
addition of a 9-month bill cycle in 1966, also account for part of
the change in bank credit seasonal factors. Further changes in
Treasury financing operations may be induced by the changing pattern
of tax payments, but the extent to which recent financings reflect
this is not yet ascertainable.

A -2
June payment the largest under the new schedule. March 15 will
continue to be a major payment date, with 1/2 of the unpaid liability
for the prior year due at that time. The proportion of current-year
tax liabilities that can be carried over to the next year (payment in
March and June) probably will be reduced in pending tax legislation,
so the relative importance of the March and June tax dates probably
will be reduced somewhat in the future.
Remittances of employee tax withholdings also are shifting
to an even pattern of semimonthly payments to the Treasury. Formerly,
there was an intraquarter pattern to these remittances, with no payment
due in the first month, 2/3 of the quarterly total due in the middle
month, and 1/3 due in the final month, the latter coinciding with
quarterly payments of corporation income taxes. Thus far, all corpora-
tions with total withholdings of $2,500 or more per month have been
required to shift to the new semimonthly schedule of payments. This
program of acceleration will be completed next Friday.
These changes in tax payments are reflected in generally
higher bank credit seasonal factors for the 5 months April through
August and in lower factors for most other months. Table I compares
the former and revised seasonal factors. The increases in seasonal
bank financing for tax payments in the spring and summer months are
reflected both directly in loans to nonfinancial businesses and
indirectly through loans to nonbank financial institutions and securi-
ties dealers, as well as in increases in bank holdings of U.S.
Government securities. Revisions in seasonal factors for bank holdings
of other securities followed a pattern similar to those for loans and
U.S. Government securities, although the changes were much less pronounced.
The revised seasonal factors also include adjustments on a
more extensive basis than in the past for calendar variations of last-
Wednesday reporting dates. Formerly, such adjustments were made only
in the series for total bank credit and U.S. Government security
holdings to reflect the temporary shift of taxable bank balances into
securities as the Cook County, Illinois property tax date (April 1)
approached. In the current revision, this type of calendar date
adjustment was introduced for other months except June and December
for which data always refer to the last day of the month. The estimated
effects of last-Wednesday variation on seasonal factors for 1966-67 are
shown in parenthesis in Table I.
In general, the pattern of these adjustments reflects a
tendency for bank credit to rise at the end of the month. Thus, when
Wednesday falls on the last day of the month, bank credit tends to be
noticeably higher than when Wednesday falls a few days earlier. For
example, the May 1967 seasonal factor for total bank credit was
raised 0.2 of one per cent ($650 million equivalent) to adjust for
Wednesday falling on the last day of the month. The exception to this

A -3
pattern, as mentioned above, is the end-of-March decline in bank
holdings of U.S. Government securities, which results in lower seasonal
factors for that month the later the Wednesday date falls. The seasonal
factor for March 1966, for example, was lowered by 0.3 of a percentage
point ($900 million equivalent) reflecting the estimated effect of the
relatively late March 30 Wednesday date.
Table II compares the movements of the former and revised
series over the last 2-1/2 years, the period in which the largest
revisions were concentrated. As indicated by the half yearly annual
rates of growth, the over-all pattern of expansion was altered only
slightly by the revision. Growth rates were reduced slightly in the
first half of each year and increased in the second half.
The revised seasonally adjusted data for total bank credit,
loans adjusted, U.S. Government securities, and other securities are
shown in Table III for the period 1965 to date. Data for earlier years
back to 1948 will be available in the September Bulletin.
