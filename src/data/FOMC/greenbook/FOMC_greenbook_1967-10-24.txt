through a comprehensive digitization proce ss which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain.

SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK
Outlook for economic activity
The preponderance of evidence continues to favor a rising
rate of economic expansion in terms of real output and a continuation
of inflationary pressures. In the third quarter, GNP rose at an annual
rate of 7.7 per cent in current dollars and over 4 per cent in real
terms despite the absence of any push from consumer spending on goods.
Investment in business fixed capital rose moderately,
reversing a two quarter decline, and housing outlays rose strongly.
Modest inventory accumulation occurred at the manufacturing level but
the rise was partially offset by a decline in distributor's stocks,
according to still incomplete data. Government spending continued its
uptrend, although defense spending rose less than anticipated earlier.
In the consumer area, the supply of new autos was too small
to furnish any real test of the strength of underlying demands. Non-
durable goods sales were more sluggish than earlier data had indicated
and lower than seems consistent with the continued rise in incomes.
Indeed, after allowance for higher prices, real takings of consumer
goods in the third quarter were virtually unchanged from the second
quarter.
Despite the limited rise in consumer dollar outlays for
goods last quarter, the main danger of excessive demand acting to
reinforce existing cost-push inflationary pressures seems to lie in
the area of consumer demand. Apart from the effects of work stoppages,

I- 2
disposable income will continue to accelerate unless its advance is
retarded by a tax increase. The rate of saving which has been main-
tained at an unusually high level since late 1966 is now about 7 per
cent of disposable income. This high rate may reflect prevailing
uncertainties about price increases and taxes, but it is also providing
a reservoir of purchasing power which may be released later without
warning.
Housing starts continued to show a marked rising trend in
recent months, reaching an annual rate of 1.45 million units in September
and a quarterly average over 50,000 higher than we had anticipated. The
September rate of starts may continue into the present quarter, If so,
residential construction activity in the fourth quarter may be somewhat
higher than the estimate shown in the GNP projection.
Although both industrial and consumer prices rose briskly in
the third quarter, there is little evidence thus far of any attempt to
accumulate inventories as a hedge against inflation, a development which
may be explained by the continued high level of inventory-sales ratios
in a number of industries, along with the high cost of carrying stocks,
and uncertainties still associated with the proposed tax surcharge.
Outlook for prices and resource use
With the auto, copper, and steel trucking strikes still in
effect and with crude oil output continuing downward, industrial pro-
duction in October is likely to hold at the reduced September rate of
156.3 per cent, or even decline somewhat further. Apart from defense

I-3
industries, there appeared to be little offset in September to the
output curtailments in strike-affected sectors and in crude oil.
If the strikes are settled before the end of this month,
industrial production should recover sharply in November and December,
both to make up for strike-losses and to meet the expected broad pick-up
in consumer demands. Industrial production is projected at 159 for the
quarter, which implies a level of about 161 in December.
Manufacturing capacity utilization declined to a new 1967
low of 83.2 per cent in September, bringing the third quarter average
down to slightly less than 84 per cent. For the current quarter the
projected rise in production will be little more than the rate at
which capacity is expanding and the utilization rate will hold at about
84 per cent.
The flurry of price increases for industrial commodities,
which began in July and continued through early October, may be subsid-
ing temporarily pending settlement of current strikes and clarification
of the demand outlook. Of particular importance will be a test of auto and
household durable goods markets, which will also affect steel demands.
Improved supplies as well as the imminence of seasonal slackening in
activity have brought partial reversal of earlier sharp price increases
for lumber, plywood, and gasoline in recent weeks; and steel scrap
prices have weakened.
However, sustained upward wage and labor cost pressures are
likely, as a result of expected large wage settlements in a tight labor
market. Partly counterbalancing this continuing source of upward price

I-4
pressure is the current and prospective sizable margin of unutilized
manufacturing capacity. But even if the recent rate of increase in
wholesale prices of industrial commodities slows, there is little
assurance of a corresponding step-down in the increase for consumer
products at retail for upward cost pressures have apparently been
stronger at retail than at wholesale. Over the next few months,
average prices of foods and foodstuffs are likely to show little change
at wholesale but to creep up at retail.
Banking outlook
Demands for bank credit from private sectors of the economy
are expected to remain relatively moderate over the balance of the
year. Business loan demands are unlikely to be very strong, as inven-
tory accumulation and capital outlays are not expected to grow rapidly.
However, a continued upward drift in capital market rates could begin
to divert business borrowers back to banks, given current levels of
bank lending rates, and the anticipatory borrowing now evident in
capital markets could also be extended to banks.
Cash needs of the U.S. Government are likely to be the
principal source of bank credit demands in the months ahead. As a
result of further Treasury cash financings in November and December,
banks will probably continue to add substantially to their holdings of
Treasury issues. Banks will probably also be fairly active buyers of
State and local government securities in view of the highly attractive
yields emerging. Moreover, State and local governments may be forced

I- 5
to rely more on short-term issues especially attractive to banks, in
light of the possible congestion in capital markets. Finally, banks
are likely to continue expanding security loans in providing the short-
term financing necessary to market absorption of Treasury and other
security issues.
Total demand deposits are likely to increase further as
banks meet credit demands. In recent months such deposits have been
rising rapidly partly in reflection of the faster pace of economic
activity and partly in consequence of Treasury financing through tax
and loan credits. Moreover, the expansion of private demand balances
has also likely been associated with desires for liquidity in periods
of uncertainty about the course of developments in financial markets.
Growth in time and savings deposits other than large CD's
will probably be in the neighborhood of recent rates--which in turn
were only somewhat below the pace of earlier this year--provided there
is no further sharp rise in market yields. CD growth is expected to
maintain its recent modest expansion. Bank interest in such instru-
ments, and also in Euro-dollars, is likely to become more avid only if
business loan demands shows a sharp spurt or if banks become convinced
that short-term interest rates will press even closer against the
Regulation Q ceilings.
Capital markets outlook
The renewed advance of bond yields triggered by the recent
downgrading of prospects for enactment of a tax increase seems likely
to carry at least somewhat further unless these prospects are changed.

I- 6
As expectations of generally higher yields have spread, the actions of
both borrowers and lenders thus far have tended to reinforce the rate
uptrend. Institutional investors are holding back in the commitment of
available funds, and an increasing number of major business corporations
are reverting to the anticipatory borrowing pattern that ballooned the
supply of publicly-offered bonds so sharply last summer. Underwriters
report a substantial increase in the number of additional firms now
hoping to cover their long-term financing requirements this year. While
it is not yet clear whether additions to the near term calendar will
rebuild new issue volume to the $1.7 billion monthly average level
reached in the summer, October offerings are now expected to be at
least $400-500 million larger than the $925 million September total.
As bond yields have advanced generally, some State and local
government borrowers have either chosen, or been forced by rate ceil-
ings, to postpone or cut back scheduled borrowing. Additional actions
of this type seem likely in the period ahead, but their interest rate
effects will probably be counteracted by offsetting additions to the
calendar from other borrowers seeking to get ahead of the expected rate
advances and from the sharp build-up expected in the volume of indus-
trial revenue bonds.
U.S. Government financing needs also will continue to exert
upward interest rate pressure. The Treasury is expected to announce
the terms of its mid-November refunding in a week. While the maturing
issue is relatively small in size, the financing is likely to be more
than routine since the Treasury will probably take the opportunity to

I- 7
raise part of their remaining fourth quarter cash requirement and may
include an intermediate-term issue in the financing package.
In mortgage markets, upward rate pressures can also be
expected to persist, as advancing bond yields continue to divert funds
of diversified institutional lenders away from mortgages. Moreover,
further widening of rate spreads favoring short- and intermediate-term
market securities over claims at depositary-type institutions could
begin to make more serious inroads into savings growth at thrift
institutions. The pace of such net savings inflows has already
moderated somewhat from the record second quarter rate.
International developments
More complete data confirm earlier estimates that the U.S.
payments deficit on the liquidity basis was at a $2-1/2 billion annual
rate in the third quarter. The near-term outlook is for continuation
of the deficit at about that rate, with renewed expansion in merchandise
exports matched by an upturn in imports, and with little change in net
outflows of U.S. capital.
In Germany, business activity has turned up rather strongly
since mid-year, judging from data through August on industrial produc-
tion, new orders, unemployment, and imports. Real gross domestic
product in Germany, which had declined from mid-1966 to mid-1967, is
now expected to increase by about 4-1/2 per cent from the second half
of 1967 to the second half of 1968, in spite of tax increases that will
take effect in January. Recovery in Germany will help to spark a more
general pickup in continental Europe, which should ultimately strengthen
U.S. and U.K. exports.

S-8
Unfortunately, the stimulus to British exports may not begin
to show up for some time. Further deterioration in the British foreign
trade balance in September, when exports declined again, provoked
renewed market pessimism about the prospects for sterling, and the
U.K. trade figures for October may be adversely affected by dock strikes
that began in mid-September and have not yet been settled. Thus the
position of sterling remains sensitive to confidence factors, and also
to the pull of any increase in U.S. and Euro-dollar interest rates.
In recent weeks, advances in sterling money market rates
have diminished somewhat the interest incentive for movements out of
sterling into the Euro-dollar market. And if U.S. CD rates stay near
present levels and Euro-dollar rates remain firm, U.S. banks may not
actively seek to attract additional foreign funds through their
foreign branches in the weeks ahead,

THE ECONOMIC PICTURE IN DETAIL
Gross national product. The rise in GNP in the third quarter
amounted to $15 billion, annual rate, according to the first official
estimates. Although an increase if this magnitude has appeared in the
Greenbook for the last two months, there are differences of composition
between our earlier projections and the latest estimates. Most important
is that more of the rise reflects price increases than we anticipated.
Also, consumer expenditures for nondurable goods, on the basis of revised
retail sales data, increased much less than indicated earlier. As a
result, the increase in private final sales was less than we had projected
and this was offset in total GNP by modest accumulation of inventories
rather than small decumulation.
Despite these changes, and making the same assumption as
earlier about the limited nature of auto and other strikes, we see
little reason to modify our estimate of a $20 billion rise in current
dollar GNP for the fourth quarter. This implies a step-up in the
rate of growth in real GNP from 4 per cent to 6 per cent. The GNP
deflator is assumed to continue to increase at about the advanced
third quarter rate, partly because of a prospective Federal pay raise.
The third quarter increase in the deflator included very sharp increases
in the construction and government deflators as well as a pronounced
step-up in the consumption deflator in line with recent consumer price
developments.

II -2
The potential for consumer spending is still very strong,
and almost all other major sectors of final demand are expected to in-
crease in the present quarter. Inventory building is also likely to
take place at a little faster rate than in the third quarter.
In the third quarter, unit auto sales were well maintained
despite stock shortages and price increases, but a real test of the
market of the 1968 models is yet to come. Buying of furniture and
appliances has not yet shown clear signs of the recovery we have been
predicting. Nondurable goods sales advanced modestly in the third
quarter and all the rise can be accounted for by price increases.
(Retail sales were revised down sharply in July and August and showed
little improvement in September, according to advance estimates.)
Sluggishness in nondurable goods sales recently is surprising
in view of the rapid advance in wages and salaries. Although a major
part of the 7.5 per cent annual rate of rise in personal income in the
third quarter was offset by increases in prices and tax payments,
real income as well as money income has been growing steadily this
year. Consumers are electing to save a relatively high proportion
of after-tax income, however, as is'indicated by a continuation of the
personal saving rate at about 7 per cent in the third quarter. We
have estimated the 7 per cent saving rate will continue in the fourth
quarter because of continuing uncertainties affecting consumer attitudes.

II -3
We have estimated that new domestic car slales will rise to
a rate of about 8.3 million units not far above the rate in the
third quarter. Because of higher prices, however, auto and parts
purchases may riee by over 2 billion dollars. Consumer nondurable
sales are projected to increase faster than in the third quarter
although the rise is less than in our previous projection.
Housing starts have continued to rise, and in September
were about 1.46 million at an annual rate--the same rate as for the year
1965 as a whole. In view of the rapidity of the recovery from the
fourth quarter of 1966, as well as the relatively high cost of
mortgage borrowing, starts may level off in the fourth quarter at about
the September rate. Reflecting this levelling off and also the high
proportion of apartments--less expensive than single family units--
started this spring and summer, the fourth quarter expenditure increase
for residential construction is likely to be less than the $2.3 billion
rise in the third quarter.
Expenditures for business fixed capital rose in the third
quarter by $1.4 billion, following two quarters of decrease. This
increase was larger than the $1 billion rise shown in the August
Commerce-SEC anticipated expenditures, and was apparently centered in
nonmanufacturing industries, particularly the airlines. The third
quarter estimate was based on data supplementary to the survey, and
it suggests some further expansion in the fourth quarter. In addition

in view of the sharp rise in construction costs recently, we have
upped somewhat our earlier estimate of the fourth quarter increase in
business fixed investment.
The rise in Federal defense expenditures slowed drastically
last quarter; defense outlays increased only $1.4 billion, the smallest
rise since the beginning of the Vietnam build-up. This slowing
conforms to the Budget estimates plus the $4 billion supplemental, and
thus may indicate a much reduced rate of growth in the future. However,
the chances still favor a Federal workers' pay raise, retroactive to
October 1, which will cause a much larger increase in defense outlays
this quarter. Nondefense outlays will also reflect a pay raise, plus
an increase in expenditures for crop surpluses.
Inventory data now available for July and August reveal a
sharp rise in the book value of manufactuerers' stocks, virtually all
in the business and defense equipment and motor vehicles industries.
A substantial part of the latter reflects the accumulation of automobile
parts and materials in manufacturers' hands prior to the delivery of the
new models to dealers, and a significant proportion of this may reflect
an inadequate seasonal adjustment this summer when the model changeover
was advanced. In view of recent declines in distributors' inventories,
which may well have accelerated in September because of the auto strike
and a sizable valuation adjustment for rising prices, the accumulation
of total nonfarm inventories on a GNP basis is now estimated by Commerce
at a rate of only $1.1 billion in the third quarter.

II -5
In the current quarter our projection includes $1.5 billion
of nonfarm stock-building, though this remains an area of great uncer-
tainty. The increase in inventories of defense products and machinery
and equipment is likely to slow. However, at retail, nonautomotive
stocks are assumed to rise further, as they did in July and August.
Moreover, if our assumptions with respect to auto strikes are realized,
the sharp third quarter decline on this account will not be repeated.

II -8
Industrial production. In September, the Board's index of
industrial production declined 1.5 points to 156.3 per cent of the
1957-59 average--reversing a large part of the summer run-up.
The September decline reflected primarily curtailment of
output in the auto and steel industries (together these took 1.3 points
out of the index) as a result of work stoppages which are still in
effect and which are therefore holding the total index down in October.
Another downward influence in September was the initiation of cutbacks
in domestic crude oil production--which had increased sharply in July
and August when mid-East oil supplies were restricted; this cutback--
reflecting improvement in mid-East supplies--continued, at a faster
pace, in early October. Moreover, the copper strike, which reduced
metal mining sharply in July and August, is still in effect causing some
further curtailment in September and perhaps also in October.
Expansionary effects were only minor in September. Output
of defense equipment continued to expand, but this accounted for less
than 0.1 percentage index point. Production of business equipment
remained at about the July-August level, with truck output curtailed
moderately because of the Ford strike. Output of appliances, TV and
radios, which (in part owing to settlement of a strike that had limited
June output) had increased sharply in July and August to the highest
level of the year, was about unchanged in September. Nondurable goods
production also remained stable, at a level equal to last December's
high.

II -9
Manufacturing capacity utilization. The operating rate for
manufacturing fell to 83.2 per cent in September, well below the previous
low for the year of 84.0 recorded in July and 84.4 per cent in August.
The decline was largely due to strikes in the automobile and steel
hauling industries. Utilization rates for both primary and advanced
products moved downward but the decline was somewhat greater in the
advanced products industries where the auto strike had a direct effect.
Spare capacity exists in most manufacturing industries.
Manufacturers of aircraft and electric power generating equipment con-
tinue to operate at unusually high rates. Utilization rates are
relatively high in petroleum refining and in the rubber industry where
producers are still making up for output lost on account of the recent
strike.

Unit auto sales and inventories. Dealer deliveries of new
domestic automobiles in the first ten days of October declined one-
fourth from a year earlier. Excluding Ford sales, which have been
unusually low because of the strike, the total sales decline was 4 per
cent. Both General Motor's and Chrysler sales were down somewhat, but

II -10
it is difficult to judge the significance of this because of the
earlier model introduction dates this year. It appears, however, that
GM and Chrysler are not benefiting materially from the strike at Ford,
For September, the seasonally adjusted annual rate of sales
of domestic units was 8.1 million units, down 6 per cent from a year
ago. The stock of autos available at the beginning of October was one-
fifth below a year ago, owing largely to the strike.
The table below shows the seasonally adjusted days' supply
of new domestic autos based on end-of-month stocks and daily selling
rates for that month. The days' supply available at the beginning of
September and October of this year was 6 per cent and 12 per cent lower,
respectively, than last year but was about the same as in 1965.

Used car sales in September were unchanged from a year
earlier while stocks were off 7 per cent. Auction prices of used cars
have been strong the last several months and have not shown their usual
seasonal decline.

II -11
Sales of imported cars in September were up about 8 per cent
from a year ago, but this increase was small compared to recent months.
For the first 8 months of this year, sales were 18 per cent above the
comparable months of 1966. The slower recent pace is expected to
persistfor a time because of reported supply limitations.
Consumer credit, Consumer borrowing has picked up in recent
months, following a very slow period in the spring, but net increases
in outstanding instalment credit continue to be modest. The rise in
outstandings in the second quarter--$698 million or $2.8 billion annual
rate--was the smallest since the final quarter of 1961. The third
quarter rate moved up to an estimated $3.5 billion, but this was less
than half that of a year earlier and substantially below the record
$8 billion rate reached in the third quarter of 1965.
Repayments on old instalment debt recently have been in a
strong uptrend. In the third quarter alone, consumers increased their
repayments by a half billion dollars over the second quarter, which
itself was a half billion over the first. In contrast, the average
quarterly increase during 1966 was less than a quarter billion dollars.
As a consequence, the ratio of repayments to disposable income has now
recovered to the high point of early 1966, when it stood at 14.4 per
cent.

Most of the sluggishness in the consumer credit expansion
this year has been a reflection of developments in the auto sector.
Through the first 8 months, auto credit outstanding was expanding at
an annual rate of only $216 million, only one-tenth the $2.3 billion
rate for the corresponding period in 1966. Meanwhile, auto terms con-
tinue relatively easy but typical downpayment and maturity requirements
are not being breached to any important extent. In most cases it still
takes about 20 per cent down to purchase a new car and the maturity is
set at 36 months. But the proportion of customers getting the "more
favorable" terms is creeping up again.
Demand for nonauto goods credit has been relatively strong
all year, in part because of increased credit card activity at banks.
Personal loan volume has also been well maintained although increases
have not been as rapid or large as might be expected given the increases
in consumer spending on services. Many lenders have been finding that
there is less demand for personal loans to finance travel, vacation, and
other service expenditures, now that credit cards have become a handy

II -13
Retail sales. Retail sales, which on the basis of revised
figures showed no change between June and August, rose fractionally in
September according to advance estimates.
For the third quarter as a whole, sales at nondurable goods
stores rose only about half a per cent. Expenditures for food consumed
at home, which account for about one-third of the total, were sluggish,
despite a considerably higher level of prices in the third quarter than
the second. On the other hand, expenditures for restaurant meals,
prices of which have risen at a very fast clip over the past year, have
continued to rise strongly. The general merchandise group and apparel
stores have shown very modest increases, and fell in September according
to the advance estimates.
Durable goods sales have also shown little strength, the
4 per cent advance in the third quarter arising almost entirely from
higher sales in the automotive group.
Downward revisions of retail sales estimates were unusually
large in July and August. At the time of the last Greenbook, sales of
nondurable goods for those two months appeared to be almost $3 billion
higher, at an annual rate,than the revised numbers now shown.
Business inventories. The preliminary July showing of a
slight further decline in business inventories has been converted, as
a result of a sizable upward revision in manufacturers' inventories
and a moderate boost for wholesalers', into an increase totaling about
$250 million. In August, according to preliminary figures, the over-all
book value increase was even larger--about $375 million.

II -14
Manufacturers now show accumulation averaging almost $500
million in July and August--reversing abruptly the declining trend in
the first half of the year which culminated in sizable liquidation in
June. The July-August accumulation occurred in the durable goods
sector (nondurables showed small net liquidation), and within that
sector it was concentrated mainly in the defense and business equipment
sector and in the motor vehicle industry. Of the $1 billion plus
accumulation during the two months in the durable sector the defense
and business equipment industries accounted for roughly 50 per cent,
the motor vehicle industry, 40 per cent, and remaining industries,
10 per cent. The bulk of the increase was in work-in-process. For
the auto industry, the sharp spurt in stocks undoubtedly reflected in
part inadequate seasonal'adjustments.
Liquidation of wholesale and retail trade inventories
continued in July and August. Moderate declines in both months at the
retail level were caused by continued sharp reductions in auto dealer
stocks. Apart from autos, retail stocks rose in July and August.
New and unfilled orders for durable goods. New orders for
durable goods declined 1.3 per cent in August from the level of the
previous month according to preliminary figures released by the Census
Bureau. An earlier Census release had shown August orders to be down
2.3 per cent. The upward revisions were fairly evenly distributed
throughout the list of industries.

II -15
The August decline was centered in the volatile aircraft
sector where orders were off 35 per cent. Orders for durable goods
exclusive of aircraft were up 2.5 per cent. Orders for primary metals
were down but machinery, fabricated metals, and other durable goods
showed increases. The special machinery and equipment grouping was up
4 per cent for the fifth increase in the last six months.
Unfilled orders were virtually unchanged according to the
revised figures. Aircraft backlogs declined 2 per cent because of the
sharp drop in new orders. Backlogs were up moderately in most other
industries.
Construction and real estate. Value of new construction put
in place, which had been revised upward by 1 per cent for both July and
August, moved higher in September. Reflecting the substantial, further
recovery in housing starts in recent months, outlays for residential
construction continued to pace the advance as shown in the table.
While still about 7 per cent below the recent peak in January of 1966,
the rate for the residential group was the highest in more than a year.
Private nonresidential construction outlays, unlike residential
construction expenditures, have shown relatively little change in recent
months from the reduced rate reached last April, and in September they
were still about a tenth below the peak reached last January. Within
this sector, industrial construction outlays have fluctuated irregularly
above their recent low in April and a further decline in commercial
construction activity has been offset by increases in expenditures for
hospitals and other types of nonresidential buildings and related

II -16
structures. Public construction in September remained near its
February peak and was appreciably above a year earlier.

In the current reappraisal of Federal spending evoked by
Congressional resistance to a tax increase, some cut-backs in military
building plans have already been made by the Administration in recent
weeks and some tentative proposals to modify certain other Federal
building programs, including those for highways have also been publicized.
Indications are, however, that the effect of such adjustments--to the
extent that they will be made--will not be felt until some time in
1968. Consequently, the prospect is that public construction will

II -17
play at least a neutral role in over-all activity during the near
term and that, with prices continuing to rise, t tal ccnstruction
will reach a new high before the year-end.
Seasonally adjusted housing starts, which had already
advanced sharply further during the summer months, continued upward
in September, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.46 million.
The September advance, which was not expected or technical grounds,
raised the average for the third quarter as a whole to 1.41 million,
a sixth above the improved second quarter average and the highest rate
since the first quarter of 1966. A major factor in the further rise
in September was a very substantial recovery in starts in the Northeast
from a temporarily reduced August rate. This more than offset
declines in all other regions except the West.
Seasonally adjusted building permits also rose further in
September. Most of the rise was concentrated in multifamily units,
which advanced 5 per cent after an upward revision for August.

While mortgage costs have reversed direction in recent months
and home prices have continued upward, the dollar volume of sales of
existing homes in August were running a fifth above its reduced year-
earlier level, according to the National Association of Real Estate
Boards. In the case of sales of speculatively built new homes (data
currently available only through July) also show appreciable year-to-
year improvement, though at a seasonally adjusted rate no higher than
last May. A factor in this development has been the relatively limited
supply of available new homes. Although the basic demand potential for
single family units as well as that for multifamily units has continued
to grow, speculative builders so far this year generally have been
reluctant or unable to build ahead of the market in the face of the
rising discounts on Government-supported as well as conventional
mortgages in certain states. As a result, seasonally adjusted stocks
of new houses last summer remained at the unusually low level reached
in April, and the ratio of total stocks (including those under con-
struction) to sales held at less than 4 months' supply--quite low for
the series.
Labor market. The labor market continued firm in September
despite some apparently rather dramatic figures to the contrary,
including both a drop in employment and a sharp rise in unemployment.
But nonfarm employment would have risen further had it not been for the
auto and teachers' strikes. The rise of three-tenths of a point in the
unemployment rate to 4.1 per cent in September reflected the fact that

II -19
an unusually large number of adult women endered the labor force with
a consequent sharp rise both in their employment and in their unemploy-
ment rate. In fact, the reported sudden rise in labor force participa-
tion among adult women may reflect no more than the difficulties of
accurately adjusting for certain changes in concepts and for the effect
of new questions introduced in the household series in 1967.
More important than these aggregate measures were underlying
indications of continued labor market tightness. The unemployment rate
for adult men was down one-tenth of a point in September to an extremely
low 2.3 per cent, and for nonwhite men declined to 3.5 per cent--the
lowest rate since these data became available over a decade ago. The
unemployment rate for teenagers--although extremely high--remained
virtually unchanged over the month. Similarly, the rate of insured
unemployment--which tends to be particularly sensitive to activity in
the industrial sector of the economy--was down by three-tenths of a
point in September to 2.4 per cent of workers covered, almost back to
its low level a year earlier. Hours of work generally held firm in
September. Another measure of labor demand--the index of help wanted
advertising--rose again.
Nonfarm employment. The nonfarm employment picture in
September was one of selective strength. Nonfarm employment declined
116,000 to 66.1 million but about 235,000 more strikers were off pay-
rolls in mid-September than in August. After allowance for this,
nonfarm employment showed a gain of over 100,000, with all of the

II -20
increase in services, trade, and the Federal Government. The non-
industrial sectors have provided virtually all of the 1.7 million net
increase in nonfarm jobs over the year.
Manufacturing. In manufacturing, after allowance for strikes,
little additional strength was evident. Factory jobs declined by
180,000, with the durable goods sector accounting for most of the drop.
The Ford strike resulted in a sharp drop in employment in transporta-
tion equipment and moderate declines in the steel, fabricated metal,
and electrical equipment industries.
Construction employment in September was unchanged for the
third successive month at a level slightly below a year earlier.
However, there was a significant lengthening in the average workweek
which suggests that employers may be responding to increases in resi-
dential construction.
Nonindustrial employment. In contrast to the industrial
sectors, private services in September continued to show consistently
large increases in employment. Job growth in medical and health
services accounted for one-third of the 45,000 increase in all services
in September, and for over 40 per cent of the 560,000 rise since
September 1966. After a mid-summer lull, employment in retail trade
moved up again, and total trade employment in September was 400,000
above a year earlier. Finance has also shown a steady increase;
employment was 150,000 higher than a year ago. However, the upward
momentum in the public sector was interrupted. Disputes between teachers

II -21
and school boards in several cities involved about 60,000 persons
during the survey week and eliminated the usual increase in State and
local government employment, which averaged 50,000 a month last year.
The employment picture in October is again likely to be a
mixed one. The settlement of the teachers' disputes should result in
a brisk rebound of State and local government employment, but the con-
tinuation of the Ford strike through the mid-October survey week
suggests that manufacturing employment will again be weak, particularly
since there are likely to be some secondary effects apparent in the
October figures. Secondary layoffs would also affect the unemployment
figures, since persons laid off as a result of a strike are counted as
unemployed, although the strikers are not. Unemployment insurance
claims figures suggest that some 15,000 workers had been laid off by
the end of the first week in October as a result of the strike.

II -22
Productivity. Data on output per manhour for both the total
private and private nonfarm economy incorporating the regular annual
revisions of gross national product, employment and hours were recently
made available through the second quarter of 1967. Over-the-year,
rates of productivity increase trended downward from mid-1966 through
the first quarter of 1967. There was a modest rebound in real private
output in the second quarter of 1967, accompanied by a sharp pick-up
in productivity.

The second quarter productivity spurt reflected largely a
downward adjustment of manhours by employers, reacting to reduced rates
of growth. Manufacturing employment declined by over 200,000 in the
second quarter; construction was off by 100,000; and employment gains
were smaller than usual in other sectors and with workweeks also
reduced, total private manhours fell by 5,7 per cent (annual rate)

II -23
from the first to the second quarter. In conjunction with the modest
rise in output, this resulted in a sharp pick-up in productivity between
the first and second quarters. The last time such a sharp rise in
productivity occurred was in the second quarter of 1961--also immediately
following a decline in real private output.
However, despite the gain from the first quarter, productivity
increases from a year earlier were still relatively small in the second
quarter--l.9 per cent for the total private economy and 1.2 per cent for
the nonfarm sector. The average productivity growth rates for the total
private, and private nonfarm sectors were 3.4 and 3.0 per cent, respectively,
during the 1962-1966 period. With private output expected to continue
to expand at a more rapid rate, an acceleration of year-to-year gains
in productivity is in prospect.
Wholesale Prices. Prices of industrial commodities at
wholesale increased 0.2 per cent from mid-August to mid-September,
according to the BLS preliminary estimate, bringing the rise from
mid-July to 0.5 per cent, or an annual rate of 3 per cent. As a result
of a number of announced price increases to be effective after mid-
September, a further appreciable rise in the BLS industrial average
appears likely by October 10 (the October pricing date).
The rise over the past 3 months encompasses a wide array of
industrial materials and products, beginning with petroleum and products,
silver, rubber products, and building materials in July, and then
extending to steel mill products, copper products, some basic chemicals,
metal working machinery, and 1968 models of motor vehicles, TV, and

II -24
appliances. A number of the latter increases--particularly those for
1968 autos and some chemicals and steel products--will appear for the
first time in the October price index.
Increases for building materials played a significant role in
the recent run-up--ranging from lumber and plywood to glass, gypsum
products, and various metal items. Price advances for lumber and ply-
wood were particularly large during the summer, when drought and forest
fires in the Northwest curtailed logging operations and lumber production.
In recent weeks, improved supplies have reportedly resulted in partial
reversal of the earlier sharp price increases for lumber and plywood.
Moreover, gasoline prices--which had also contributed to the summer
advance--have been declining with the usual seasonal fall-off in
consumption. These declines coupled with a dearth of announcements of
new price increases quite recently suggest a possible slowing in the
rate of advance of industrial prices until settlement of the current
strikes--which are depressing industrial production and incomes--permits
better judgment of both demand and cost pressures on prices.
Prices of farm products have declined considerably since mid-
year as a result mainly of bumper harvests of most grains and fresh
vegetables and maintenance of hog marketings at unexpectedly high levels.
Cattle slaughter and beef production have eased below a year earlier and
prices have moved up fairly steadily. For all livestock and products
combined, including red meat, poultry, eggs, and dairy products, the
near-term outlook still is for some reduction in market supplies from
earlier advanced levels and for stability or perhaps some strengthening

II -25
in prices; in the longer-run, ample supplies and low prices for feeds
should encourage hog raising and cattle feeding and larger market
supplies of meat.
Farm production in 1967. Uncertainty about the size of the
nation's crop harvest has been allayed by the favorable October 1 report.
Although early frost in the North and hurricane "Beulah" in the South
trimmed yields of late maturing crops in these areas, a record output
17 per cent above the 1957-59 average is assured. Pasture conditions
on October 1 better than a month earlier and a year earlier assure good
grazing for livestock.
Crops of wheat, corn, sorghum grain, soybeans, and rice are
of record size. Their prices have been falling since mid-year and on
September 15 were well below year earlier levels as shown in the table.
Crops expected to be of less than record size include cotton, oats,
barley, rye, flaxseed, peanuts, dry beans, potatoes and deciduous and
citrus fruits. Cash prices of these commodities showed little reaction
to the October Crop Report with the exceptions of potatoes and citrus
fruits. Potato futures declined sharply in response to the report and
frozen orange concentrate futures increased. Fall potato prospects
increased 3 per cent from September. The short 1967-68 citrus crop
apparently caught traders unaware. Hurrican damage in Texas and last
spring's frost and drought in Florida reduced crop prospects to about
the size of the light 1965-66 crop.
The 8.1 million bale cotton crop is the smallest since 1921
for two reasons: (1) unusually large participation in the acreage
diversion program, and (2) unfavorable weather cut yields by 14 per cent.

II -26
Meat production has been running well above relatively short
1966 output through September but margins over a year ago have been
norrowing since mid-year. In September, pork production was 9 per cent
above a year earlier, poultry meat 8 per cent above, and beef a little
below. Net farm value of pork and frying chickens was down about one-
sixth from last September and beef was 5 per cent higher. Milk production
averaged slightly under a year earlier through September. The September
price at wholesale was also slightly under a year earlier. Apparently,
milk prices supported at levels a fourth above 1965-66 levels have
discouraged consumption. Through August, the Commodity Credit Corporation
had bought surplus milk products equivalent to 8 per cent of production.
Last year, CCC purchases were negligible.
On the strength of the September 21 pig crop survey showing
September 1 numbers down 1 per cent from a year earlier, the USDA is
forecasting fourth quarter pork production at near year-earlier levels
with possibly a dip below late in the quarter. If this production is
realized, hog prices are likely to stay close to a year ago, too.
Cattle feeders report that they had 2 per cent more cattle on feed on
October 1 than a year earlier and that they intend to market 2 per cent
more cattle in the fourth quarter than last year. With marketings this
close to a year earlier, fourther quarter per capita supplies of fed beef
will be no larger than a year ago. Accordingly, USDA analysts assessing
fourth quarter price prospects for fed cattle lean toward continued
stability at present levels, in part because demand for fed beef tends
to be weakened by strong seasonal competition from pork and turkey in
the fourth quarter.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL SITUATION
Bank credit. Lacking the stimulus of a Treasury financing
or an acceleration of tax payments, bank credit at all commercial banks
in September increased at an annual rate of less than 8 per cent, or
about one-third the July-August pace. Late in the month and in early
October, however, bank credit expansion at the weekly reporting banks
accelerated somewhat. During the second week in October earning assets
of these banks will probably show a substantial rise associated with
bank underwriting of the recently issued tax anticipation bills.

Liquidation of U.S. Government securities was quite modest
in September following bank acquisitions of the notes issued for cash
by the Treasury at the end of August with 100 per cent tax and loan
credit. The slower pace of business loan demands in September and the

III -2
attractive yields on the notes led to smaller than normal sales by
banks of their securities. There were also sizable bank purchases
of other Treasury issues--particularly bills by the larger institutions.
In late September and early October, New York City banks did liquidate
over $500 million of Treasury securities, mainly bills, but these ap-
parently represented reduction of trading position by dealer banks.
In the second week of October, New York banks acquired almost $1.2
billion of bills in the recent financing--with 75 per cent tax and loan
credit.
Acquisition of other securities in September moderated further
to about an 8.5 per cent annual rate. The further slowdown of tax-exempts
put on by banks in September probably reflected earlier portfolio
positioning in expectation of heavy loan demands. As indications
developed of relatively modest business loan demands, banks
increased their purchases of municipals, with deliveries reflected
in a higher pace of tax-exempt acquisitions at weekly reporters in late
September and early October. At New York banks, purchases continued to
be essentially all in the short-term maturities, (More detailed informa-
tion on the maturity of municipal bond holdings of member banks as of
mic-1967 can be found in Appendix A.)
As in August, business loan growth continued moderate in
September, expanding at about a 3 per cent annual rate,"/ less than
1/ Based on revised seasonal adjustment factors. See Appendix B, for
a discussion of revised seasonally adjusted loan components for all
commercial banks.

III -3
one-third of the first half pace, when tax-related loan demands were
sizable. A large part of the September growth was associated with a
sizable contraseasonal increase in bank holdings of acceptances--
apparently reflecting acceptance financing by the Japanese. Borrowing
over the tax and dividend dates at weekly reporters outside of New
York was relatively large--perhaps indicating that the financial
position of businesses with limited access to capital markets has not
improved as much as that of the major corporations.
Though business loan expansion in September as a whole was
moderate, these loans increased sharply at weekly reporting banks in
late September and early October. The early October expansion probably
reflected in large part borrowing to meet accelerated payments of with-
held taxes--as in 1966. Following this expansion, business loans declined
more than usual at New York City banks. On balance, business loan
developments since the September tax date have not yet formed a pattern
which permits any clear generalization, but it does not appear that
any unusual strengthening of business loan demands has developed in
recent weeks.
Despite the slower growth of business loans, total bank loans
in September, as in July-August, expanded over twice as rapidly as in
the first half of 1967. The earlier growth was largely accounted for
by the behavior of security loans in July and August, associated in
large part with Treasury financings. In September security loans
continued to expand relatively rapidly, but the more recent growth
reflected an increased volume of loans on securities other than Treasury

III -4
issues. In early October these trends continued. A substantial
volume of these "other" security loans in recent weeks is reported
by some banks to reflect greater financing of commercial paper in-
ventory and miscellaneous transactions. Although margin and security
underwriting loans of banks probably also increased, bankers suggest
that these did not account for a large share of the expansion in total
security loans.

Loans to nonbank financial institutions--which have declined
on balance since mid-1966 as finance companies have relied more on
market financing--increased relatively sharply in September. A large
part of this increase was associated with the earlier automobile model
introduction, which affected the timing of needs of finance companies
to finance dealer floor plan loans. Additionally, a large but temporary

III -5
unsecured loan to a life insurance company also is reported to have
increased total nonbank financial loans sharply in September. Real
estate and consumer loans in recent weeks have continued to expand
somewhat more rapidly than in the first half of 1967.
Bank deposits. After a $850 million attrition in negotiable
CD's in September, weekly reporters increased their outstandings by
$120 million in early October. However, in the second week of October--
with increased competition from the new tax bill--outstandings in
New York declined somewhat, although Chicago bankers were able to
increase their CD's by almost $50 million. CD rates continued to edge
up slightly the first weeks of October. Offering rates of 5.50 per cent
on long maturity CD's became more common, but a few banks have shaded
downward their rates on shorter maturities since the tax date. This
rate pattern is in keeping with the shift in bankers' expectations
toward relatively modest near-term loan demands. In early October,
outstanding CD's totaled $20.0 billion, $750 million below their late
August peak, but a $4.4 billion increase for the year to date.
Slower CD growth has tended to keep the expansion in total
time and savings deposits in early October to only somewhat above the
September 11.4 per cent rate of growth. In addition, a moderately
slower growth in consumer-type interest-bearing deposits has apparently
continued into early October.
In the first two weeks of October the 90-day Euro-dollar
rate has risen about 50 basis points above the September average.
This increase, associated mainly with seasonal factors, has brought

III -6
the rate relationship between CD's and Euro-dollars back to a more
normal level; since late July rate relationships had made Euro-dollars
a relatively attractive source of funds to U.S. banks, and from May
through August borrowing from branches had increased about $900 million.
Despite CD run-offs and the attractive Euro-dollar rate, however, the
level of such borrowing remained essentially unchanged over the month
of September, but then expanded by over $200 million in early October--
to the highest level since December of 1966.
The money stock in late September and early October rose
somewhat faster than the 1.3 per cent annual rate for September as a
whole. This rise partly reflects fluctuation in Treasury cash balances
in recent weeks, although the growth may also have been sustained by
recent expansion of total bank credit demands.
U.S. Government securities market. Yields on Treasury
notes and bonds rose further in the first half of October, with yields
on 20-year bonds advancing to new 45-year highs and those on 5 to 10
year bonds approaching their highs of 1966. Treasury bill rates also
moved up in this period, as the table shows.

The recent gradual, but substantial, rise in Treasury bond
yeilds has occurred against a background of large Treasury deficit
financing, increasing pessimism concerning passage of the President's
tax recommendations, uncertainties created by weakness in sterling,
and recent and prospective major additions to the corporate bond
calendar. While some investor selling of Treasury coupon issues has
been reported, partly on switches into new corporate and agency issues,
dealers have been reluctant buyers and on balance their holdings of
over 1-year issues changed little between late September and mid-October.
In this period the Treasury investment accounts made some purchases
and at mid-month dealers held only about $50 million of issues maturing
in more than 1 year.

III -8
The rise in Treasury bill rates this month has occurred
while the market was digesting $4.5 billion of new April and June tax
bills auctioned on October 3. Banks, which underwrote virtually all
of the new issues because of the 75 per cent tax and loan credit allowed
by the Treasury, appeared to be somewhat larger sellers of the new bills
than had been anticipated by the dealers. Thus, dealers built up their
inventories of bills in this period despite some fairly good offsetting
nonbank demand at times and sizable System purchases earlier in the
month. It should be added that shorter-term bills maturing before the
end of this year have been in good demand recently and rates on such
issues have not moved up with the rest of the market. Relatively low
dealer financing costs from day-to-day have also encouraged some dealers
to position bills, thereby moderating the recent advance in yields.
In the first half of October, selected yield increases
continued to occur on short-term market instruments other than bills,
and currently yields on virtually all of these instruments are higher
than a month ago, as the table shows.

to 5.88 per cent on 5-year Federal Land Bank bonds. The latter issue
met with a relatively poor market reception and recently traded at a
discount to yield about 5.95 per cent. On balance, recent agency offer-
ings have not involved the raising of any net new money from the public,
but some seasonal demands for new cash could occur in December, perhaps
supplemented by an offering of participation certificates.

III -10
Treasury finance. The Treasury is expected to announce the
terms of its November refunding on October 25. The financing will
involve a relatively moderate $2.6 billion of publicly-held maturing
debt, but the Treasury is also expected by the market to raise some
net new cash in this refunding. And even if a fair amount of new money
is raised in conjunction with the November refunding, the Treasury will
probably need to return to the market for additional cash later in
November, possibly with a payment date in the first half of December.
On our projections, the Treasury will need to raise $3.5 to $4.0 billion
of new money before mid-December, not counting continued $100 million
additions to the weekly and monthly bill auctions.
Corporate and municipal bond markets. Yields on new and
seasoned corporate bonds have advanced significantly from late September
to levels not reached since the early 1920's. And sensitive municipal
yield indices have risen to the highest levels since the early thirties,
when the value of the Federal income tax exemption was considerably less
than presently.

Intensification of the general upward pressure on bond
yields has developed as events in Washington have led market
participants to conclude that no tax increase will be enacted this
year. In light of these changed expectations, a number of corporations
with future needs for funds have taken steps to accelerate the timing
of their borrowing. At the same time, investors have shown a reluctance
to commit funds for new corporate offerings, until they have a better
fix on how far the present uptrend in rates can be expected to go.

III -12
Ten corporate bonds with sizeable unsold balances have
been released from underwriters price restrictions since late
September with subsequent yield advances in the secondary market
ranging from 6 to 17 basis points. Five recent issues still remain
in syndicate. While one of these, last week's $75 million Aaa-rated
Philadelphia Electric Company offering with 5-year call protection,
provides investors a record-breaking yield of 6.10 per cent, the issue
remains less than one-third sold, And most recently, a Aa-rated
utility with 5-year call protection was reoffered at 6.375 per cent
but failed to attract significant investor interest, despite the fact
its yield is 18 basis points above a similar offering only two weeks
ago.
Reflecting the stepped-up supply of new offerings, the
estimated October volume of publicly-offered corporate bonds has been
revised upward to $1.3 billion, $400 million above the reduced September
level. Total stock and bond offerings, including private placements,
are also expected to be larger than in September and nearly 2-1/2 times
greater than in October 1966. Recently announced issues of three large
corporations, which are known to have given up hopes of catching a
better market, account for most of the upward revision in October volume.
The November calendar of corporate public bond issues has
also been growing rapidly and may ultimately approximate or exceed
the increased October volume. Issues definitely scheduled for November
already aggregate more than $750 million, and sizable further additions
are generally anticipated by underwriters.

The changed outlook on taxes, with its implications for
monetary policy and bank investment demands, has created particular
weakness in the municipal bond market. While recent weekly calendars
of new issues have been relatively light due partly to a number of
postponements, current and prospective offerings are much larger,
and dealers have added to market pressures by attempting to liquidate
holdings of older inventories.
Because postponements or reductions in the size of new
offerings amounted to more than $180 million during the first two
weeks of October, municipal offerings for the month as a whole are
now expected to drop below $1 billion. Among the issues indefinitely
postponed is the $120 million Kentucky Turnpike Authority bond, which

III -14
has now been deferred on three occabions starting in the late summer
of 1966. Several other recent postponements were forced by statutory
interest rate limits.
With a sizable volume of municipal issues already tentatively
scheduled for November, volume in that month may again expand to or
above the $1 billion mark. But any estimate in the present circumstances
is highly tentative both because of the sensitivity of marginal borrowers
to levels and changes in bond yields, and because of the uncertain
timing of the large volume of industrial revenue issues now planned.
Some underwriters are estimating that $1.2 to $1.5 billion of new
industrial revenue bonds will be brought to market over the balance
of this year and early next year, as corporations and municipalities
seek to take advantage of tax exemption before the Treasury Department
can force a change in this feature of industrial revenue issues.

Mortgage markets. Mortgage lenders in September generally
looked for no more than a usual seasonal decline in loan-commitment
volume over the near term, but indications were that lenders have become
increasingly selective in recent months. This change has reflected
the continued upward yield pressures from other sectors of the capital
market since last spring, along with the growing concern about additional
pressures that might be expected in 1968. As a result, although net
inflows of loanable funds have remained quite large, mortgage interest
rates and yields required by lenders have continued to move upward.
In September, while contract rates for conventional first
mortgages on new homes remained at about their advanced August average
(FHA series), those for existing homes rose about 5 basis points further,
to 6.60 per cent. Also, the FHA secondary market yield series--the most
sensitive of the mortgage yield indicators--advanced for the fifth
consecutive month, to within 18 basis points of the peak reached last
November. To meet this advance in yield requirements, discounts on such
mortgages, which had already moved beyond the restrictive 4 per cent
range in June, continued to move higher in September, as shown in the
table.

Although the upward adjustment in mortgage yields has been
sustained, it has not been so sharp as the advance in yields offered
by other types of competing instruments in most recent months. Con-
sequently, the yield advantage offered by mortgages has remained
exceptionally low. In September, it was only 75 basis points higher
than that on new Aaa-rated corporate bonds. This compares with an
average differential of at least 100 basis points in 1964 and appreciably
more in most other recent years. Moreover, with bond yields moving
higher again in October, even this differential may have been narrowed

III -17
still further. In these circumstances, offerings by private holders
of mortgages for purchase by the FKMA in the secondary market have
turned up again after a short-lived drop following the 1-1/2 point
downward adjustment in purchase-price by FNMA in late August.
Flows to depositary-type intermediaries. Incomplete data
suggest that savings and loan associations probably experienced no
serious further slowing in the growth of their share capital during the
September-October reinvestment period (in which shareholders of many
associations are free to withdraw funds without loss of interest).
Even when dividends credited are excluded, the associations in the
Federal Home Loan Bank Board sample show only a slight net withdrawal
through the fifth business day of October. Unfortunately, although
this represents a substantial improvement over the like period of last
year when savings and loan associations were still under considerable
pressure, no comparable data are available to show how recent experience
relates to earlier years in the 1960's. For the whole month of October
last year, all savings and loan associations experienced a net with-
drawal of $56 million, which compares with net inflows in Octobers of
the four preceding years ranging from $580 to $815 million.
No universe estimates of reinvestment period experience are
available for mutual savings banks. Data for the 15 largest mutuals
in New York City do show a less favorable year-to-year comparison
in the reinvestment period than for the S&L's. But by October 1966 net
inflows to savings banks had already recovered significantly to a level
not far below most earlier years.

While the preceding data suggest that savings experience
at depositary-type institutions has remained quite favorable recently,
there was some general tendency for growth in seasonally adjusted savings
flows to slow down during August and September. As the table shows,
this tendency seems significant chiefly when compared with the record
expansion of the second quarter. Thus, even if final data should
ultimately indicate that the August-September tendency toward a somewhat
slower savings growth has continued in October, this would probably
still not represent any real change from what participants in the
thrift industry characterized as "normal" in their responses to last
month's Federal Reserve survey.

Stock market. Stock prices, as measured by Standard and
Poor's composite 500 stock index, have declined about 2,5 per cent
from the near-record level reached on October 9. Trading volume was
initially heavy, but slackened somewhat as the decline continued.
Further widening to a new record of the spread favoring
bond over stock yields seems to have been the major contributor to
the recent uncertainty about stocks. But fears of another credit
crunch in the months ahead have apparently also refocused market
attention on the weaknesses imparted to stocks by tight money last
year. In addition, some third quarter reports of corporate earnings
appear to have been a disappointment to market participants.I m

III -20
Prior to the recent price weakness a number of stock price
indices had moved to new highs--particularly those which measure
developments in stocks with special speculative appeal. As the table
shows, both the American Stock Exchange index and Standard and Poor's
low-priced index showed larger advances than either the broad New York
Stock Exchange index or the narrower "blue-chip" Dow-Jones industrial
average. This is true whether one makes comparisons over relatively
long periods as from the 1966 highs and lows or for shorter periods
such as from the end of January, when stock market credit first began
to expand.

During September, margin debt extended by New York Stock
Exchange member firms to their customers expanded another $180 million,
the second largest monthly increase this year. Over the same period,
purpose loans at banks also rose, by about $70 million, the largest

III -21
increase for any month this year. Since the end of January, when stock
market credit stopped declining following the 1966 market break, margin
debt has expanded $940 million at member firms, and over the same
period purpose loans at banks have risen $272 million. This combined
increase of $1.2 billion has raised outstanding stock market credit to
a new record total of $8.1 billion.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS I
U.S. balance of payments. The deficit on the liquidity basis
continued to be large through the third quarter, and weekly indicators
for the early part of October suggest that the heavy deficit typical of
that month in other years will probably be repeated. With a preliminary
September figure of $307 million, the deficit for the quarter, without
seasonal adjustment, amounted to $1,178 million. After seasonal ad-
justment this deficit was about $630 million. Thus, on this measure
of the deficit which is commonly featured in published reports, there
will be a slight deterioration from an annual rate of $2.1 billion in
the first half to an annual rate of $2-1/2 billion in the third quarter.
To obtain a more meaningful indicator of the recent trend in
the liquidity deficit requires an adjustment for temporary factors, and
for investments of foreign official liquid dollar funds in over-one-year
deposits. The latter amounted to $914 million in the first half, so
that without this assistance the deficit rate would have been $3.9
billion. In the third quarter net transfers into official "long-term"
deposits were probably negligible, although there was some benefit
from the purchase by Germany of a $125 million nonliquid Treasury note.
On the other hand, the first half results were adversely affected by
extraordinarily large net unrecorded payments in the second quarter
($576 million), while in the third quarter such unrecorded flows may
have reversed, as a typical reflection of strong pressure on sterling.
Beginning in the second quarter there were large payments connected
with Expo 67 in Canada, and with the Arab-Israeli conflict. At this

IV -2
stage, when information for crucial sectors of theraccounts for the
third quarter is still lacking, the overall deficit figures do not
suggest that any basic change one way or the other has yet occurred.
The official settlements balance in the third quarter,
seasonally adjusted, was probably in surplus by about $1/2 billion,
as U.S. banks added about $1.0 billion to their liabilities to
foreign branches. Inflows via the branches were especially large
in August, and, after a cessation in the earlier weeks of September,
were resumed on a substantial scale. These developments are dis-
cussed below.
U.S. foreign trade. The trade balance is expected to show
some improvement in the remainder of the year over the $4.3 billion
rate of the first half. In July and August a $4.7 billion rate was
reached, even though agricultural exports were still relatively low.
The effect of the Arab-Israeli war on third quarter trade was proba-
bly a temporary increase in net exports of about $50 million. A
strike in the copper industry, which began in mid-July, has also
caused some distortions in trade patterns, but with only a minor
net effect on third-quarter trade. Imports of refined copper had
been raised early in the year in anticipation of the strike and con-
tinued high through August. On the other hand, imports of unrefined
copper were very low after June.

IV -3
U.S. liabilities to commercial banks abroad. From the end
of May to the end of August total U.S. short-term liabilities to com-
mercial banks abroad increased by $1.6 billion, after decreasing by
$0.9 billion in the first five months of the year (and by several hundred
million in the latter half of December).

Apart from the very large increase in the liabilities of U.S.
banks to their own branches abroad, to be discussed later, a $200 million
rise in liabilities to banks in Canada was the biggest single element in
this summer's increase. This reflected chiefly changes in the liabilities
of Canadian bank agencies in this country to their head offices. According
to Canadian data, the head offices' U.S.-dollar cash and balances with banks
in the United States (mainly the Canadian agencies) increased by $276
million in June and July. The over-all net flow of funds from Canadian
banks to the United States, including withdrawals by U.S. depositors and loans
and investments made directly by the head offices, was $378 million.

IV -4
The pull of funds to the United States from Canada is explain-
able by the sharp rise in U.S. money market rates in June and the widen-
ing forward discount on the Canadian dollar in July as the spot rate
rose strongly. The Canadian banks financed the flow mainly by (a) in-
creasing their net U.S.-dollar liabilities to countries other than the
U.S. and U.K. by more than $100 million; and (b) obtaining nearly $300
million of U.S.-dollar denominated deposits from Canadian residents
(presumably covered) at the expense of the Canadian official reserves.
Liabilities of U.S. banks to their branches abroad rose very
sharply in the summer, leveled off in September, and rose again in the
first half of October by about $300 million. Some of the funds U.S. banks
obtained this month are likely to have come into the Euro-dollar market
from Continental European holders moving out of sterling. Euro-dollar
market developments associated with last summer's large inflow are dis-
cussed in a later section. In September, Euro-dollar interest rates rose
sharply. In the first half of October no further important changes in
these rates occurred, and advances in sterling money market rates reduced
somewhat the interest incentive for movements from sterling into Euro-dollars.
The September advances in Euro-dollar interest rates carried
call money from a low of 4 per cent up 3/4 to 4-3/4, and 1-year money from
5-3/4 up 1/4 to 6. Other maturities moved up within these ranges. As
usually happens at the end of September, the 3-month rate rose markedly,
influenced by the seasonal jump at that time in the German 3-month inter-
bank loan rate. The 3-month Euro-dollar rate reached 5-3/4 per cent at
the end of September; since then it has eased off slightly.

IV -5
Whereas during August the spreads between Euro-dollar rates and
U.S. CD rates had been unusually small (with three'-month Euro-dollars at
about 5 per cent and CD new issues at about 4-3/4 per cent), such spreads
widened during September. This may have been a factor in the slowing of
U.S. banks' intake of Euro-dollar funds for head office use; the U.S.
banks' liabilities to branches increased very little in September after
rising by about $1 billion during July and August.
A number of factors may have been responsible for this rise in
Euro-dollar interest rates during September. (1) Though German money
market rates remained low (until the month-end jump in the 3-month rate),
German commercial banks reduced their net external assets (all currencies)
by more than $100 million, thereby tending to draw their own or others'
funds out of the Euro-dollar market. (Up to July the German banks had
been increasing their net external assets greatly.) (2) The temporary
subsiding of the flight from sterling after mid-September deprived the
market of what had certainly been an important source of funds in July
and August. (3) The generally rising trend in U.S. Treasury bill rates
since the end of July may have influenced U.S. banks to pay more for
Eur-dollar money, if necessary, to maintain their liabilities to branches
at the high level already reached by the end of August.
One consequence of the September rise in Euro-dollar interest
rates may have been to attract funds out of (covered) sterling short-term
investments, after flight movements had slackened. Statistical confir-
mation of this hypothesis is not yet available, but it is consistent with
the September widening of rate spreads in favor of Euro-dollars over sterling

IV -6
assets such as deposits with local authorities and hire-purchase finance
companies. It is consistent also with the relative firmness of the
sterling spot exchange market in the latter part of September; the move-
ments in question would have involved closing out of forward exchange
contracts rather than spot purchases of dollars.
Euro-dollar interest rates and movements of funds in May, June,
July and August. Confidential summary data are now available on changes in
the external assets and liabilities of commercial banks in most of the
C-10 countries during these earlier months, Beginning in May, U.S. banks
were increasing their liabilities to branches abroad, slowly at first
(with an interruption at the end of May) and then at an accelerating pace,
with a very large increase in August. This growth in U.S. liabilities was
mainly to branches in London. London banks, including the U.S. branches,
were in turn increasing very greatly their U.S.-dollar and other foreign
currency liabilities to continental European countries and others -- all
told, by $1.5 billion in four months. By also switching back into dollars
or other currencies out of (covered) sterling investments a sum of $0.2
billion (mainly in August), London banks were able to increase their
foreign currency assets by $1.7 billion, approximately two-thirds of which
went into net additions to the balances due to U.S. branches at their head
offices. The other one-third of this asset increase may have included
Euro-dollar lending to banks in Japan and Italy; in both these countries
banks were increasing their external dollar liabilities during these months.
The $1.5 billion increase in the London banks' external foreign
currency liabilities was facilitated by easy money conditions in Germany.

IV -7
German banks increased their net external assets by nearly $300 million
in the four months May-August; directly or indirectly this outflow, which
was especially large in May and in July, contributed to the availability
of funds in the London Euro-currency market.
During the second quarter, banks in Switzerland accepted an
increase in foreigners' Swiss franc deposits of more than $250 million and
in turn added about $200 million to their foreign-currency external assets.
The ultimate source of this addition to the international pool of funds
available to London and U.S. banks appears to have been movements out of
sterling at the time of the Mid-East crisis.
In fact, net sterling external liabilities reported by banks in
the United Kingdom -- not including U.K. official sterling liabilities --
declined by $0.8 billion in these four months. In addition, nonresidents'
holdings of local authority and hire-purchase finance company paper de-
clined by $0.2 billion. In various ways, some no doubt quite roundabout,
these withdrawals from sterling holdings must have made a very large con-
tribution to the availability of funds to the London Euro-currency market.
Euro-dollar interest rate changes during the months May-August
included: (1) during May, a rise in Euro-dollar rates, before U.S. short-
term rates started up; (2) during June, when rates in the United States
rose sharply, a leveling of Euro-dollar rates; and (3) during July, when
rates in the United States leveled off, a decline in Euro-dollar rates.
(4) Changes in August were small.
It seems likely that the resumption of the U.S. banks' bjdctag
for Euro-dollars was an important factor in the May rise in rates. After

that, however, the stability of Euro-dollar rates in June, July and August
reflected the pressure of supply of funds coming to the Euro-dollar market,
and in turn encouraged U.S. banks to absorb a large part of the supply.
On the supply side, the easy credit conditions in Germany were an important
factor at least up to July; in August, movements out of sterling became
the dominant factor.
Short-term rates in the sterling money market, which had fallen
by about 1-1/2 percentage points in the first four months of 1967, re-
mained quite level in the next four months. When Euro-dollar rates rose
in May there resulted an interest differential, uncovered, in favor of
movements from sterling paper to Euro-dollars. However, because the forward
discount on sterling first narrowed (when Euro-dollar rates rose) and then
widened again after midyear, the covered rate differentials remained fairly
small -- until the September rise in Euro-dollar rates. While movements
out of sterling this year were clearly encouraged by interest rate relation-
ships, it is also clear that much of the movement was dominated by the
confidence factor.
Interest rates in national markets abroad. Despite advances
in U.S. short-term interest rates since June, and despite increases in
Euro-dollar rates in May and June and again (after intervening declines)
in September, short-term interest rates in major European national markets
have been relatively stable. During most of July, August and September
they were near their lows for the year. There has been no significant
tightening of money in Germany, where the recent interest rate rise for
3-month interbank money is purely seasonal. The Swiss 3-month deposit rate

Movements of long-term yields have been mixed since the marked
de-escalation of rates ended last spring. In May and June waning confi-
cznce in the pound caused a sharp upturn in yields in the U.K., but rates
have not changed much since midyear. In Germany, on the other hand, bond
rates have edged down further.
In Canada, both short- and long-term rates have been rising
since April. The Bank of Canada raised its discount rate to 5 per cent
on September 27.
In Britain, short-term market rates have moved up appreciably
in recent weeks. On most days since September 21 the Bank of England has
forced the discount houses to borrow from it at Bank rate. Previously,
since April the Bank had invoked penalty rate assistance to the market on
only one occasion. In consequence of this pressure on the market, the
Treasury bill rate moved up somewhat less than 1/4 per cent by the end of
the month. The local authority rate moved similarly in September, and
has risen further this month; on October 6 it stood 40 basis points above
its mid-August-to-mid-September level.
It is generally assumed in the financial community that any
further narrowing of the margin between the Treasury bill rate and Bank
rate -- the former is now only 1/8 per cent below the latter -- would
call for a rise in Bank rate, to which the clearing banks' loan and deposit
rates are tied.
Economic recovery appears to have been under way in Britain
since June. Manufacturing output rose about 2 per cent from May-June
to July-August. Underlying this pick-up has been a rise in consumer buying.

IV -11
Retail sales (excluding autos) in August were about 3 per cent greater,
in volume terms, than in May. Installment credit outstanding, after
falling for ten months, rose in both July and August.
Continuing weakness in the current account of the U.K.
balance of payments reflects primarily a decline in merchandise exports,
which was continuing in September. Hopes for an export-powered recovery,
making the resumption of domestic growth clearly compatible with an
improvement in the balance of payments, have not been realized; but
world market conditions have been particularly unfavorable this year.
Yields on long-term British government bonds moved up about
1/2 a percentage point from April through early July, thus returning to
about the levels of November 1966. The authorities intervened to support
bond prices on several occasions in the May-July period. Changes since
then have been small.
Evaporation of confidence in the balance-of-payments outlook
brought the upswing in bond prices to a halt last spring. Profit taking
in early May helped depress prices, and at the same time institutions
were switching out of government bonds into steel shares on a large
scale after announcement of the vesting date for steel securities, because
of tax advantages. The steel industry was nationalized on July 28.
In Germany, the expansionary monetary policy introduced at the
beginning of the year produced a substantial decline in interest rates,
which continued to July for short-term rates and is perhaps not yet over
for long-term rates. However, long-term rates remain high compared with
those in the United States, Canada, and Switzerland.

Earlier indications of an incipienttax (12% on most issues,
upswing in the German economy
are supported by recent data, showing in particular a rise in manufacturers'
new orders from May-June to July-August, including a rise in consumer goods
orders; an advance in industrial production over the same interval; and a
decline in unemployment since the end of May.
New orders for capital goods were pushed up last spring by govern-
ment orders under the first investment budget and are being supported again
this autumn by state and local authorities' orders under the second invest-
ment budget; the Government recently reported that the October 15 target
date for the placing of these orders was being successfully met. The-- -- --- --- -'-

Ministry of Economic Affairs has stated that expenditures under these
investment budgets will be carried through rapidly whatever the economic
reactions. If signs of overheating reappear in the next twelve months,
other stabilization measures will be adopted, including slowing of 1968
budget outlays.
The six German economic research institutes are in agreement
that a cyclical upswing has begun. They expect that inventory rebuild-
ing after the turn of the year -- when the new value-added tax comes
into operation -- will give further support to the upswing.
The decline in German short-term interest rates has resulted
from a series of reserve requirement reductions by the Bundesbank which
have added greatly to bank liquidity. Domestic demand for bank credit
has been slow, and the banks have added greatly to their net external
assets. At the end of August these amounted to about $650 million; a
year earlier external liabilities had exceeded assets by about $300
million. As noted above, some repatriation occurred in September to
meet tax-date liquidity pressures.
Since July the Bundesbank has been acting to make outflows of
bank funds less profitable, without raising domestic interest rates. It
has done this by intervening in the spot exchange market, pushing the
dollar rate for the DM down to parity from the premium level that had
prevailed throughout the first half of the year. The forward rate has
remained at a premium. The cost of covering dollar investments, which
had been negligible at the beginning of the year, has thus averaged about
1-1/2 per cent per annum during the third quarter.

IV -14
While the decline in long-term rates has been more persistent
this year in Germany than elsewhere, 6 per cent public authority bonds are
still yielding over 6-1/2 per cent. Demand for long-term funds on the
part of public authorities has been heavy, though their access to the market
is still strictly regulated. In a notable change of policy, the Bundesbank
began purchasing long-term Federal government and agency bonds for its own
account in September.
In France, a moderate decline in short-term rates continued until
mid-September, reflecting action by the authorities to keep the banking
system liquid -- primarily through a gradual and complicated reduction in
liquid asset reserve requirements -- and reflecting also weak private
loan demand in the third quarter. Industrial production in July and August
was unchanged from June, at about the same level as at the beginning of the
year.
The Treasury has been a heavy borrower of short-term funds as a
result of the Government's widened budget deficit. New procedures require
the Treasury to enter the money market on a larger scale than formerly;
previously the banks had to buy considerable amounts of Treasury paper to
meet their reserve requirements.
Rates in the 30-day money market are influenced by Bank of France
intervention. It has become clear that an important consideration in this
intervention is to keep French rates in line with Euro-dollar rates, to
minimize both outflows and inflows of liquid funds.

APPENDIX A: MATURITY STRUCTURE OF MUNICIPAL BOND PORTFOLIOS OF MEMBER
BANKS*
On the June 30, 1967 Call Report of Condition, a special
schedule was added to obtain more detailed information regarding the
maturity structure of municipal security holdings of member banks, the
first such survey since June 30, 1956. For the first time information
was also obtained on positions in such securities held by'member banks
as dealers or underwriters, rather than as part of the banks' invest-
ment portfolio. The results of this survey are shown in tables A-1
and A-2.
Among the State and local securities held by member banks
almost one-third mature in over 10 years. Among classes of member banks,
New York City banks have the longest maturities with almost one-half of
their holdings maturing in over 10 years and almost one-third in over
20 years. Country banks have only about one-fourth of their portfolio
maturing in over 10 years, with most of their holdings in the intermediate
maturity range. The proportion of State and local securities held by
member banks maturing in less than 1 year--about one-fifth--did not
differ greatly across classes of banks, although the reserve city group
had larger holdings of tax warrants, short-term notes, and bills than
country banks, perhaps reflecting the greater reliance of States and
political subdivisions on larger banks for short-term financing.
As can be seen in line 2 of tables A-1 and A-2, a little over
$1.4 billion or 3.6 per cent of total member bank portfolios of
municipal securities were held as dealer and underwriter positions at
mid-1967, with over 90 per cent of these held by reserve city
banks.
Banks with dealer and underwriter positions in municipal
securities are few in number--95 reserve city banks and 35 country
banks--and are generally banks with deposits in excess of $500 million
(table A-3). About 40 per cent of the member banks acting as dealers
and underwriters in municipals are located in the New York, Chicago,
and San Francisco districts (table A-4). These three districts accounted
for 60 per cent of total bank dealer positions in State and local
obligations.
Trading positions accounted for 7.4 per cent of total munici-
pals held by the 95 reserve city banks acting as dealers and underwriters,
and 6.3 per cent of the total portfolios of municipals of the 35 country
banks taking such positions. It appears probable that at times variations
in trading positions--particularly at the larger banks--can account for
a considerable proportion of the short-run variations in reported bank
acquisitions of State and local banks.

APPENDIX B: REVISION IN SEASONALLY ADJUSTED LOAN COMPONENTS*
Supplementing the revised seasonally adjusted series for
money supply, bank deposits, the credit proxy, and the major bank
credit components for all commercial banks--reported in recent
Greenbooks--revisions of seasonal factors have now been completed for
the components of total loans for all commercial banks.
This revision reflects changes in seasonal factors for
recent years, including special adjustments in some series to take
account of fluctuations in loans associated with variations in the
last-Wednesday reporting date from year to year. An attempt has been
made also to reconcile the seasonally adjusted movements in the sum
of the individual loan components with changes in total loans adjusted.
As indicated by the comparisons of the monthly changes in
the old and revised seasonally adjusted loan components provided for
1966-67 in charts B-I and B-4, the most important revisions were in
the series for business loans, security loans, and nonbank financial
loans. Revisions in these three series, are most closely related to
the changing pattern of tax payments, as explained below. In addition,
these three series are affected more than other loan components by the
date on which the last-Wednesday reporting date falls. Consequently,
last-Wednesday adjustments have been made in business, security, and
nonbank financial loans based on analysis of fluctuations in weekly
reporting bank data for these categories. In most cases, last-Wednesday
adjustments reduce the seasonally adjusted level of bank loans most
when the reporting date falls on the last day of the month, although
there is considerable variation in these adjustments for different
series and different months. Last-Wednesday adjustments for security
loans appear to be due largely to the one-year and nine-month Treasury
bill auctions, which normally occur on the last day of the month.
Consequently, Wednesday adjustments for security loans are applicable
for most months only when the Wednesday date falls on the last day of
the month. Similarly, the largest Wednesday adjustments for nonbank
financial loans and for business loans are applied when Wednesday falls
on the last day of the month but variable adjustments are applied for
Wednesday dates in some months reflecting intramonthly movements at
the end of the month.

Federal Finance and Banking Data
The Revenue Act of 1964 and the Tax Adjustment Act of 1966
considerably changed the pattern of Federal tax receipts by accelerating
the payments of withheld and income taxes by corporations. The
resultant shift in payment dates has had a pervasive effect on banking
data, influencing the pattern of business loan demands, the timing of
Treasury financings, and the pattern of Government, private demand,
and time deposits. Indeed, the seasonal pattern of most components
of bank portfolios has been influenced to one degree or another.
The most important shifts in tax payment schedules were
completed in June 1967, although withholding tax remittances by
corporations will continue shifting through next February and pending
tax legislation provides for further modest acceleration of corporation
income tax payments in the future. The effects of tax shifts on
banking data have been most noticeable over the past two years. While
tax payment patterns were in transition during the entire period,
fluctuations in many banking series around the tax dates have shown
enough regularity since 1965 to indicate that large shifts in seasonal
factors are occurring. The separation of seasonal from other influences
in this period, however, is a complicated matter owing to the fact that
such factors as abnormalities in corporate liquidity, changes in avail-
ability of tax bills, and the relative attractiveness of CD's and other
liquid assets all affect the reliance of businesses on bank loans for
meeting tax payments. These complexities, as well as the limited
number of observations, make it impossible to eliminate all of the new
seasonal "noise" that began to appear in banking data in 1966.
This can best be illustrated in the business loan component
of bank credit. The solid line of the upper panel of chart B-1 shows
the estimated amount by which total corporate tax payments in 1966-67
differed from the payments that would have occurred without accelera-
tion. The dashed line shows the old seasonally adjusted month-to-
month change in business loans. It is clear, that the new tax payment
pattern has been a dominant influence in the movement of business loans
on that basis. The lower panel of this chart repeats the old seasonally
adjusted business loan pattern and adds the revised seasonally adjusted
series. As can be seen from this panel, the revised series has smoothed
the fluctuation in the old seasonal pattern, but the influence of the
new tax schedule still remains.
Charts B-2, B-3, and B-4 display the old and new seasonally
adjusted series for other components of bank credit, and suggest that
the revised seasonal factors have also removed only a part of the effect
of the new payments schedule from the banking data. Other securities
and consumer and real estate loans have evidently been affected least
by the new tax payment schedule since their new profile differs little
from the old one. Aside from business loans, security and nonbank
finance company loans, and acquisitions of Treasury securities have
been affected most.

B -3
As more experience is gained with the effects of the new
seasonal influences, further revisions of seasonal adjustment factors
will be made. However, it goes without saying that continued care
will be required in interpreting banking data whenever the underlying
seasonal factors are changing as rapidly as at present.
Revised seasonally adjusted data are shown for six loan
components in the accompanying table, covering the period from 1965-
to date. Revised data from 1959-64 will be made available in the
October "L.4.3--Banking and Monetary Developments."
