through a comprehensive digitization proce ss which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain.

SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK
Outlook for economic activity
Although we expect the pace of economic expansion to
increase considerably further this quarter, the rate of growth is
being retarded somewhat by work stoppages, which now seem likely to be
more extensive than anticipated earlier. Our current estimates still
put growth in real GNP at a rate significantly faster than in the
third quarter, and the rise in prices (as measured by the GNP deflator)
at as rapid a pace as during the summer.
Despite the dampening influences of strikes and strike-
induced layoffs on private wage and salary gains, personal income
increases are expected to be larger this quarter than last. Current
and anticipated wage increases, including the Federal pay raise,
largely account for the faster rise in personal income. Wages and
fringe benefits involved in the Ford settlement are expected to average
more than 6 per cent a year for three years. The settlement involves
an unusually large money increase in the first year, and is expected
to set a target for other settlements,
Consumer outlays are also apparently rising more rapidly
this quarter, judging from fragmentary data on new auto and other
retail sales in October. But the rise in consumer spending is likely
to be held down by the limited supply of new model autos. With dis-
posable incomes expected to advance somewhat faster than consumption,
the rate of saving may rise slightly further this quarter.

I -2
Residential construction outlays are expected to increase
sharply further this quarter, reflecting both increasing costs and a
considerably higher rate of starts in the third quarter than we had
previously anticipated. Business fixed investment is also expected to
rise moderately; the McGraw-Hill Survey, to be released later this
week, confirms the anticipated increase in plant and equipment expendi-
tures of 5 per cent in 1968 suggested by other recent private surveys.
The accumulation of business inventories this quarter is expected to
be small. Automobile stocks are likely to decline to minimum levels,
partly offsetting some possible further build-up in stocks of defense
products and machinery and equipment.
Federal defense spending, aside from the expected pay
increase for the military is expected to increase this quarter at
about the reduced third quarter rate. There will be a further boost
in Federal outlays for farm price supports, and a continued strong
growth in State-local outlays arising from increased employment, wage
rate advances, and expansion of public works.
Outlook for resource use and prices
Although there have been relatively few announcements of
price increases in recent weeks, upward price pressures on the
industrial sector are likely to continue in coming months. The com-
bined effects of earlier price and cost advances, large current and
prospective wage rate increases, and supply limitations resulting
from work stoppages are providing an upward momentum. However, a

I -3
restraining influence on the over-all upward price trend has been the
generally weaker tone this autumn in prices of farm and food products.
Most livestock and crop products, except cotton, have now declined to
the lowest levels in two years. In September retail food prices
showed some decline for the first time since April.
The recent decreases in manufacturing plant capacity
utilization have been largely due to strikes while the increases in
the unemployment rate reflect unusual growth in the labor force. At
the same time, there is some evidence of a leveling off in the earlier
sharp increases in expenditures and employment in defense related
industries. The resumption of full auto production and sales, the
increase in Federal pay and in social security benefits, the rise
in minimum wages, and other forces likely to boost incomes in the
months ahead should result in resumed pressure on the labor force and
in higher rates of capacity utilization.
Outlook for banking
Bank credit demands are expected to remain comparatively
moderate over the balance of the year. Modest increases in inventory
and capital outlays are likely to hold down the rate of business loan
expansion. Offsetting this, however, is the growing attractiveness
of the prime loan rate relative to the cost of open market financing,
which could lead to some switching to bank financing by businesses
and to continued strong use of bank loans by finance companies.

I-4
With no further Treasury financings involving direct
debt scheduled until next year, bank acquisitions of Treasury
securities will probably moderate, although banks are likely to
remain interested in bills and other liquid assets in anticipation
of renewed loan demands next year and of a concurrent monetary
restraint. Banks, especially smaller ones, are also still likely
to seek relatively long-term investments in view of the very
attractive yields available, particularly on municipal securities
but also on the offerings of FNMA and Export-Import Bank PC's expected
in the weeks ahead.
While the recent higher levels of interest rates have
increased the attractiveness of investments to banks, these levels
are also tending to reduce somewhat the banks' ability to attract
deposit funds. At offering rates of 5-1/2 per cent, CD's maturing
in 6 months or more now cannot compete effectively on a rate basis
with market instruments. Although some longer-term CD's are likely
to be sold in coming weeks, an increasing proportion of sales will be
made in the shorter maturity ranges where effective offering rates
remain below the Regulation Q ceiling. While November CD inflows
may benefit from temporary investment of the proceeds of a few large
capital market issues, December tax and dividend maturities are quite
large and sizable attrition could develop. Under the circumstances,
banks are likely to remain active in the Euro-dollar market. Inflows
of consumer-type deposits may be retarded slightly as a result of the
recent Treasury financing, but current rate relationships are unlikely
to produce any sharp drop-off in inflows of such deposits.

I -5
Growth in total demand deposits is also likely to
moderate in coming weeks as loan demands remain modest. Sizable
offsetting variations between private and Government demand deposits
may be expected as Treasury balances are reduced to relatively low
levels in the latter weeks of the year.
Capital markets outlook
The near-term course for bond yields seems to be further
upwards, as market hopes for effective fiscal action this year have
faded and been replaced by a growing conviction that monetary policy
will have to tighten. Both underwriters and institutional lenders
are generally assuming that the recent pattern of anticipatory
borrcwing in long-term markets will continue in the months immediately
ahead, even in the face of rising interest costs. Moreover, the
market is expecting a sizable FNMA PC offering, which will compete
actively for available capital market funds.
The calendar of new corporate and municipal offerings
next week is exceptionally heavy. On next Tuesday (November 14)
alone, issues totaling more than $900 million are scheduled for
offering--headed, in the corporate market, by $225 million of U. S.
Steel debentures and, in the municipal market, by $130 million of
Mississippi industrial revenue bonds and $100 million of State of
California bonds.
In mortgage markets, fragmentary reports suggest that
while interest rates have been rising, they have continued to lag

I -6
behind changes in bond yields, as is typically the case in such
circumstances. With spreads between bond yields and mortgage rates
at one of the narrowest margins in history, significant further
increases in mortgage rates seem likely during the weeks ahead
even if the uptrend in bond yields should moderate. At the same
time, while no dramatic shrinkage of net savings flows to thrift
institutions ic expected over the rest of 1967, additional evidence
for October indicates some further moderation in the pace of net
inflows, after seasonal adjustment.

I- 7
Balance of payments
Further information and new adjustments of the third quarter
data indicate that the deficit in that period on the liquidity basis
was larger than previously estimated, and reached about $3 billion at
an annual rate, compared with a rate of about $2 billion during the
first half of the year. Nevercheless, as net acquisitions of over-
one-year time deposits and nonconvertible Roosa bonds by foreign
official institutions were small in the third quarter, the rate of
deficit before reduction by such transactions diminished--from about
$4 billion to about $3 billion.
The near-term outlook is for continuation of large deficits
in the U.S. balance of payients on the liquidity basis. Among the
various influences that held down receipts or raised U.S. out-
payments in the third quarter some are probably persisting in the
current quarter. The upward movement in long-term interest rates
in this country has been encouraging anticipatory borrowing by
Canadian issuers of securities. The advance in GNP has kept imports
of finished goods at a high level, while the decline in imports of
materials has moderated.
Other factors in the situation have mixed implications.
On the one hand, for example, the closing of Expo-67 brings to an
end a season of unusually large tourist expenditures. Also, diffi-
culties of seasonal adjustment may have made the third quarter bank
credit outflow look larger than would be fairly representative of
current movements. On the other hand, sterling's persistent

I- 8
troubles, which in the third quarter may have produced unrecorded
private receipts for the U.S. balance of payments, are now having an
unfavorable impact on our balance of payments through operations to
liquefy part of the U.K. official investment portfolio. The tem-
porary decrease in U.S. petroleum imports last summer, which followed
the Mid-East crisis, is beginning to be reversed, and some strike-
anticipating imports of steel are likely before long.
On the official reserve transactions basis, large quarter-
to-quarter fluctuations in the balance have occurred. A surplus of
nearly $400 million is presently estimated for the third quarter.
The fourth-quarter balance on this basis as well as on the liquidity
basis will be adversely affected by the U.K. operations mentioned
above. Tending to hold down the deficit, however, there has been a
further rise in the liabilities of U.S. banks to their foreign
branches since the end of September.

THE ECONOMIC PICTURE IN DETAIL
The Nonfinancial Scene
Gross national product. The fourth quarter increases
in GNP in both current and constant dollars now appear likely to
be somewhat smaller than projected in the preceding Greenbook,
mainly because of altered assumptions regarding strikes in the
automobile industry rather than because of any major change in
underlying demands. We now expect a rise in current dollar GNP
of $18 billion, annual rate, in this quarter compared to a rise of
$15 billion in the third quarter. Real GNP is projected to increase
at an annual rate of slightly over 5 per cent compared to a little
over 4 per cent in the third quarter.
The increases in dollar GNP continue to reflect rather
large advances in prices. The GNP deflator is projected to rise at
an annual rate of 3.7 per cent in the fourth quarter, about the same
as in the third quarter. However, 0.6 points of the 3.7 per cent is
attributable to the anticipated Federal pay raise, which is treated as
a straight price increase in the calculation of the deflator. Con-
sumer prices, with autos up 2 per cent, and apparel prices sharply
higher, are likely to rise as fast in the fourth as in the third
quarter. Construction costs should advance further but are unlikely
to equal the sharp step-up reported for the third quarter.
Work stoppages at Ford persisted longer than we had
anticipated and the likelihood of strikes at General Motors--and
possibly at Chrysler--now appears much greater than it did earlier.

II -2
Even if agreements on a national basis are reached fairly promptly,
production may be hampered by work stoppages at individual plants
over local issues.
In consequence of the greater-than-anticipated strike
effects, our estimate of unit sales of new domestic cars in the
fourth quarter has now been reduced to 8 million, annual rate, from
the 8-1/4 million we projected earlier; total consumer outlays for
durable goods consequently have also been lowered somewhat. More-
over, it now appears that dealer stocks of autos will be sharply
curtailed this quarter, after allowance for the usual seasonal
increase. The longer work stoppages in autos should result in sharp
step-ups in production, purchases, and inventories in the first half
of next year, reinforcing the effects on incomes in that period of
likely Federal and private pay raises, the wage increase already
provided by existing legislation, and the anticipated large increase
in social security benefits. In addition, both producers and consumers
of steel may be adding to theirstocks in anticipation of a possible
strike when the present contract expires at the end of July.
Total consumer expenditures for goods are still expected
to rise at a faster pace in the current quarter than in the preceding
period, although shortages of some new model autos may shift some
spending to nondurables and other durable.goods. Weekly retail trade
data for October suggest more strength in nondurable goods sales and
some improvement in furniture and appliances following a relatively
weak third quarter. Color TV sales appear to be chalking up
significant gains.

II -3
Underlying the projected increase in consumer spending
is the expected further sizable expansion in incomes. Personal
income is expected to rise almost $14 billion, annual rate, in the
fourth quarter, compared to $11.6 billion in the third quarter,
despite the effect of work stoppages in slowing the increase in
wage income. Farm income is now rising again, interest income is
expanding rapidly and other components of income, including transfer
payments, are continuing to increase.
Although the increase in consumer disposable income in
the fourth quarter is now expected to be somewhat below earlier
estimates, the saving rate is likely to increase slightly to over
7 per cent of income as the auto strike and the expected bunching
of a retroactive Federal pay increase in December may limit the rise
in consumer outlays.
Residential construction expenditures continue to be a
strong upward force in the economy and are-now projected to rise
about $2.3 billion, to $27.7 billion in the present quarter. This
increase is considerably larger than shown in our previous projection.
Starts in the third quarter were unexpectedly large as a result of
upward revisions in the July and August figures and a strong September
1/performance.- Fourth quarter starts are projected to be somewhat
higher than in the third quarter because of the momentum already
achieved,the relatively high level of current mortgage commitments,

and possibly because some builders may accelerate their rate of
starts in view of growing uncertainties about the continuing avail-
ability of mortgage funds around current rates.
Scattered information on the outlook for fixed investment
in plant and equipment continues to suggest only modest improvement.
The McGraw-Hill survey, which will be available later this week,
is expected to be consistent with the results of other recent private
surveys showing an increase in plant and equipment outlays next
year of about 5 per cent in current dollars. Commercial and industrial
construction are still declining, especially in real terms.
Government outlays for goods and services, which are
projected to rise about $6 billion, annual rate, in the current
quarter, are expected to account for about one-third of the increase
in GNP. The odds still favor a pay increase before year-end for
Federal civilian and military employees amounting to about $i. 70billion or
5 per cent, annual rate, retroactive to October l,although pay checks
are not likely to incorporate these increases before December.
Defense spending in the current quarter, except for
added employee and military compensation, is expected to rise at
about the third quarter rate of $1.5 billion. This slower rise in
defense outlays after the large increases in the first half of the
year appears in line with the slower recent rise in prime contracts,
leveling in orders for defense products, and the more nearly stable
size of the armed forces. The $1.4 billion rate of rise in Federal
nondefense outlays in the current quarter reflects both an assumed

II -5
pay raise of over $1 billion and a further increase in outlays for
farm price supports.
Accumulation of nonfarm inventories in this quarter
is expected to be quite modest and less than projected earlier,
since a decline in auto stocks, because of strike disruptions, is
expected largely to offset a net increase in other areas.

Industrial production. Available production and employment
data for October indicate a Slight further decline in industrial
production from the preliminary September level of 156.3 per cent.
"Special" situations again seem to account for most of the decline.
Auto assemblies in October remained at the sharply reduced
September level as the Ford strike continued into early November.
Production of television sets, furniture, and apparel apparently
changed little in October. Output of industrial equipment declined
further, mainly because of a strike (now settled) at Caterpillar
Tractor Corporation, and was one-tenth below last December's peak.
Production of commercial equipment was maintained at levels prevail-
ing earlier this year while output of trucks remained at the
strike-reduced September level. Output of aircraft and defense
equipment generally, however, continued to advance.
Steel ingot production changed little in October but
crude oil production declined 6 per cent further as allowables
were reduced further by state regulatory agencies. Among other
materials, employment data indicate a rise in output of some
chemical and stone, clay, and glass products, little change in
textiles and paper, and further declines in some auto supplying
industries.
The underlying trend of production in the manufacturing
sector does not appear strong even after allowances for strikes
and other special situations. Average hours worked in manufacturing,
which had been rising in the third quarter, declined in October with

II 9
declines widespread in both durable and nondurable industries.
Manufacturers' inventories of finished goods and work in process
continued to rise through August and then leveled off in September.
At months' end, they were up 6 per cent further from the high
December 1966 level. Also, in recent months, the physical volume
of retail sales, excluding autos, has shown little significant change.
Manufacturing capacity utilization. The estimated operat-
ing rate for manufacturing fell one point to 83.2 per cent in
September, slightly below the previous low for the year of 84.0
recorded in July. Much of the decline was a result of the work
stoppage in the automobile industry; the operating rate would have
been about 34 per cent if automobile output had been maintained.
Because of continuing growth in capacity the estimated
utilization rate would fall 0.4 points in October, even if manu-
facturing output were unchanged. Since output is expected to be
down a little the decline in the utilization rate is likely to
be somewhat larger.
Unused capacity currently exists in most manufacturing
industries. Only the aircraft, rubber, and petroleum industries
seem to be operating at high rates relative to historical experience.
UTILIZATION RATES
Industry July August September
Manufacturing 84.0 84.4 83.2
Primary products 81.8 82.0 81.8
Advanced products 85.6 85.6 84.2

II 10
Manufacturers' shipments and inventories. Shipments of
all manufactured goods decreased 2.7 per cent in September, owing
largely to the auto strike. Excluding automobiles, other manu-
facturing shipments were down only 1.3 per cent. Shipments of
durable goods other than autos declined 0.3 per cent, but remained
higher than in any month except August this year. Shipments of
non-durable goods were down 1.6 per cent, the second consecutive
month of moderate decline.
Manufacturers inventories were virtually unchanged in
September, after rising sharply in each of the previous two months.
Inventories of finished goods and of materials increased slightly
while work in process showed a small decline.
Orders for durable Roods. New orders for durable goods
declined 2.3 per cent in September according to Census Bureau
preliminary figures. Totals for both August and September were
revised upward, however, from those given in previous releases.
Motor vehicle orders declined because of the Ford strike. The
volatile aircraft series was up 30 per cent from an unusually low
August figure. If motor vehicles are excluded from the total,
durable goods orders are up slightly in September. If both
autos and aircraft are excluded, the total decline is 2.5 per cent.
Orders for durable goods increased about 10 per cent
between January and June, but for the last three monts have remained
in a range a little below the June high. The lag between orders

II -11
and production in the aireraft industry is long; if this highly
irregular seies is excluded, the rise in new orders continued
through August, but declined in September.
Unfilled orders for durabler goods were up 0.6 per cent
in September marking the fifth consecutive monthly increase. About
two-thirds of the increase over the five month period has been in
defense products. The other third is about evenly split between
the iron and steel and machinery and equipment industries.
Auto sales and stocks. Dealer deliveries of new domestic
autos in October were 16 per cent smaller than a year earlier; if
Ford cards are excluded, however, sales were 5 per cent larger.
In the final ten days of October it appeared that the long strike
was stimulating sales of the other auto manufacturers as their
deliveries were up 16 per cent from a year earlier, after no change
in the first twenty days.
The seasonally adjusted annual rate of total domestic auto
sales in October was 7.0 million units as compared with 8.1 in
September. Dealers' stocks of new cards on October 31 were slightly
below ten days earlier and one-fifth below last year.
Nearly all of Ford's 160,000 production workers are
expected to be back on the job by the end of this week but it will
be considerably longer before inventories reach normal levels. These
work stoppages and reduced sales have not lowered the auto industry's
sales expectations of 9.0 to 9.2 million units (including imports)
in the new model year.

II -12
Sales of imported cards in October increased 15 per cent
from a year earlier; such sales are expected to total a record
750,000 units this calendar year.
Consumer credit. Consumer credit has continued to climb
during the summer and early fall, but the rate of expansion has
continued at the reduced rate of earlier this year and far below
1966. For example, in September consumer instalment debt outstand-
ing increased at an annual rate of $3.4 billion, while a year earlier
the increase was $5.7 billion. Two years ago, the annual rate of
expansion was $8.2 billion
The slowdown in credit expansion continues to be centered
in the auto area. The volume of auto extensions has been running
below year-earlier levels throughout 1967. At the same time, repay-
ments on old debt have been larger than in comparable 1966 months.
The net result has been a sharp slowing in the expansion of outstand-
ing consumer auto debt. On average, auto debt during the first nine
months of 1967 increased only $21 million a month, sharply below the
$175 million monthly average for 1966. Indeed, in two months--
February and April--auto repayments actually exceeded extensions
and outstanding auto debt declined.
Meanwhile, terms on which consumers have been obtaining
auto credit continue relatively easy. Sales finance companies have
been writing more new-car contracts at 36-months than ever before.
In September, 82 per cent of all their new-car contracts provided for

II -13
this maturity, as compared with 80 per cent a year earlier. Down-
payment requirements also have eased on new cars, following a
periods of stiffening last year. The finance companies also have
moved toward slightly longer average maturities on used-car contracts.
The "over 30-months" category now accounts for 38 per cent of the
total, up about two percentage points from last spring.
The principal exception to this easing trend in auto
terms has been in downpayment requirements for used cards. In the
first few months following the turnaround in monetary policy late
last year, downpayments became less restrictive. But there has been
a noticeable tightening again this past spring and summer. By
September, only 9 per cent of all used-car contracts written by
sales finance companies were in excess of 120 per cent of dealer
cost, down from 15 per cent or more early this year.

II -14
This recent stiffening in used-car downpayments may
be in response to an increase in delinquency and repossession rates,
but it may have broader implications arising out of the searching
look which some finance companies appear to be giving their consumer
loan portfolios. The large independent finance companies in particular
are attempting to upgrade their auto paper, and at the same time they
are moving more aggressively into nonauto goods and personal loan
areas, as well as into business financing activity.
Construction activity and real estate. New construction
put in place, which was revised upward significantly in August and
September, rose further in October to a new record high. The major
upward impetus has come from the accelerated recovery in residential
construction over the past ten months. Private nonresidential
construction expenditures have changed little since April, at a
level a tenth below their peak last January. Public construction
expenditures, however, apparently continued to edge upward in October,
to another high.

1/ Seasonally adjusted annual rates; preliminary. Data for the most
recent month (October) are available under a confidential arrange-
ment with the Census Bureau. Under no circumstances should public
reference be made to them.

II -15
While the uptrend in residential construction has been
pronounced this year, it has been limited in the case of single
family homes by the relative inability or unwillingness of speculative
builders to build ahead of the market under prevailing financial
market and other conditions. As a result, speculative builders'
stocks of new homes either completed or under way have remained
at the already reduced August level; in August the latest month
for which data are available, they amounted to only 3.7 months
supply. Although data on vacancies for the third quarter are not
yet available, the limited volume of completions so far this year
and the steady accumulation of basic demands probably has continued
to drive vacancy rates down further. Nationally, vacancy rates on
rental units during the second quarter were already at an 8-year low.
The further recovery in housing starts in the third quarter
was stronger than generally expected, but even the more optimistic
trade projections tend toward a level for 1968 as a whole not much
higher than the 1.46 million annual rate (including farm starts)
reached in September.
Labor market. Employment and unemployment figures for
October indicate a pause in employment expansion, appearing to re-
flect largely temporary factors. Job growth has been curtailed in
manufacturing and transportion--which are showing the direct and
indirect effects of several major strikes--and in the public services,
which have been affected by the curb on Federal government hiring.

II -16
With the settlement of the Ford, agricultural machinery and steel
haulers strikes, however, a significant rise in nonfarm employment
should be apparent in the November figures.
Nonfarm employment rose only modestly in October, while
at the same time, the labor force continued to grow at a brisk
rate. As a result, the unemployment rate rose by two-tenths--
the second consecutive month of increase--to 4.3 per cent in October.
Although the unemployment rate for adult males was also up in October--
by two-tenths of a point. The rate at 2.5 per cent was still extremely
low and virtually unchanged from a year earlier.
The factors making for some easing in the labor market
seen likely to be of short duration; the settlement of the Ford
and other major strikes alone should result in increased employment
in autos, metals and machinery, barring a protracted strike at
G.M. Moreover, the current rapid rate of expansion of the labor
force--which is now tending to raise the unemployment rate--augurs
well for meeting the sharply increased demand for workers that is
suggested by our projections for the near future. The total labor
force in October was over 2 million above a year earlier--some half
a million greater than normal--including for the first time in many
years a large number of additional male workers who are now reaching
adult working age.
Nonfarm payroll employment rose by 113,000 to 66.2 million
in October, with increases concentrated in State and local government
and trade. The number of workers who were still on strike in October

II -17
was large (over 200,000) including the strikes in autos, agricultural
machinery, copper, and independent steel haulers. In addition, there
were some secondary layoffs--unemployment claims suggest about 20,000--
as a result of strikes.
Manufacturing employment appeared to show firmness in the
face of the direct and indirect impact of the strikes. Employment
increased by 13,000 in October, and this gain would have been closer
to 30,000 if employment in durable goods had not been reduced by
new strikes in the agricultural machinery industry. Employment
in the primary and fabricated metals industries held firm at the
September level. Modest increases in employment occurred in the
stone, clay and glass, and lumber industries.
In contrast to the durable goods sector, employment in the
nondurable goods industries showed a recovery of 25,000. Increases
were generally small, with the apparel and chemical industries
contributing the largest gains.
The workweek in manufacturing, at 40.7 hours in October,
was off by one-tenth of an hour over the month, and remained over a
half hour below the level a year earlier. There were widespread
but small dips among durable goods industries. The largest declines
occurred in transportation equipment and nonelectrical machinery,
as a result of the Ford strike. The picture was somewhat erratic
in nondurable goods, where the workweek was off by three-tenths of
an hour.

II -18
The lack of the usual employment strenth in the non-
industrial sectors was a significant factor in slowing the over-
all employment gain. Federal civilian employment is now showing
a definite downward trend, perhaps in part due to delays in approving
funds for government agencies. Federal employment declined by 11,000
in October and is now down by 55,000 from the July high, Private
services did not show their usual employment rise and the increase
in State and local government mainly reflected the return of school
teachers on strike in September. Construction employment continued
relatively unchanged in October as has been the case since July.
However, trade employment continued to show significant gains in
October.
Earnings. Average hourly earnings of production workers
in the total private nonfarm economy rose one cent in October to
$2.72, and are now 12 cents or 4.6 per cent above a year ago.
Manufacturing hourly earnings, at $2.85, showed no change in October.
The relatively small increase from a year earlier, (3.G per cent),
reflects largely the decline of six-tenths in overtime hours at
premium pay, and the reduced levels of employment in some high wage
industries. The effect was apparent mainly in durables, up by 3.1
per cent over the year; in nondurables, hourly earnings were up by
5.2 per cent.
The recovery of hours of work and employment in the high-
wage auto, metals and agricultural machinery industries and the
direct and indirect impact of the effect of raising earnings in the

II -19
manufacturing sector significantly. The Ford wage settlment of 5.0
to 6.6 per cent (see Appendix A) can be expected to set a pattern for
the industry, and should also affect upcoming negotiations in the
steel, can, and other industries. Hourly earnings in nonmanufactur-
ing industries continue to exhibit annual rates of growth of more
than 5 per cent, with construction and finance showing increases
of 6.3 and 6.0 per cent, respectively.
Minimum wage increase. 1968. In addition to the sharp
increase in prospective earnings resulting from negotiated wage
rate adjustments, increases in the minimum wage will become effec-
tive on February 1, 1968 and should increase aggregate wages sub-
stantially. The minimum wage will go up by 20 cents to $1.60 per hour
for workers who had been covered under the Fair Labor Standards Act
prior to the 1966 Amendments. The $1.60 minimum should have a
direct impact on the wages of about 6 million workers, resulting
in an estimated increase of almost $2.0 billion in the annual wage
bill. In addition, the minimum wage will be increased 15 cents,
to $1.15, for workers first covered by the 1966 Amendments. About
2 million worlers were first brought under coverage in early 1967
under these Amendments, mainly farm workers and workers in trade
and service activities. The direct impact of the increase in their
minimum wage has not as yet been estimated, but will be smaller than
the impact of the rise in the minimum to $1.60 for wor-ers already
covered. However, in addition to the direct effects of the minimum

II -20
wage increase, the tendency to maintain wage rate differentials
is likely to result indirectly in further upward adjustment of wage
rates for higher-rated workers.
Wholesale prices. The final BLS report on industrial
commodity prices confirms the increase of 0.2 per cent estimated
for September, and the preliminary October estimate showed another
0.2 per cent rise. This brings the rise from mid-July, just before
the recent upturn began, to mid-October to an annual rate of 2.8
per cent, the largest increase since the first half of 1966.
Whether the industrial price rise has continued since the BLS
October pricing date (October 10) is more uncertain than had been
the case in the three preceding months, when a rise in the index
could be anticipated on the basis of frequent and widespread announce-
ments of price increases. In recent weeks, there have been very few
such announcements, with the main advances apparent in copper and
brass products where a strike affecting most domesticcopper output
is now in its 17th week.
In September, as in August, there was a relatively wide
diffusion of price increases among the various components of the
industrial commodity average--in each month, two-fifths of the 225
product classes showed increases (double the number of decreases).
Petroleum and products, rubber products, and building materials
had dominated the August increase; about two-thirds of the September
rise was accounted for by lumber, plywood, steel scrap and steel

II -21
mill products, and copper products. Price increases were effected
in September for some additional rubber products (mainly for indus-
trial use), and cotton textile prices also increased.
Lumber and plywood prices had been rising steadily
through the spring and early summer, with the strengthening in
residential building activity. In late August and early September,
logging operations were curtailed in the Northwest by a temporary
closing of forests, and the BLS price index for lumber in mid-
September rose 3 per cent (as much as over the preceding 6 months)
and for plywood, about 5 per cent. These sharp increases, coupled
with sizable gains for steel scrap and copper mill products, led
to a pronounced spurt in the Board's index of sensitive industrial
materials. Prices of sluggish materials edged up slightly further--
mainly because of the rise in steel mill products; and average prices
of industrial products showed a much smaller increase in September
than in August, when rubber and petroleum products were boosted
substantially.
By October 10, with improved logging supplies in the
Northwest and with the seasonal decline in shipments for homebuilding
underway, prices of lumber and plywood were declining and despite
further increases for copper products the index of sensitive items
probably declined. The October increase in the total industrial
price average thus apparently reflected some further upcreep in
sluggish materials (some additional steel mill products, a few basic

II -22
chemicals, and building materials other than lumber and plywood) and
a step-up in product prices--reflecting particularly higher prices for
1963 model autos and trucks.
Wholesale prices of foods and foodstuffs declined about 1
per cent from mid-September to mid-October, according to the BLS
estimate (and because of this decline, the total wholesale price
index edged down 0.1 per cent). The mid-October level was down
about 3 per cent from July and only 1 per cent above the April low;
since mid-October these prices may have declined further.
Hog prices have declined steadily and sharply since mid-
year as marketings have persisted at unexpectedly high levels.
On the basis of earlier pig crop surveys it had appeared that hog
slaughter would be down to year-earlier levels by October, but
instead it remained well above a year ago. Moreover, pork storage
stocks are up sharply. Beef production has been running at about
year earlier levels since late July--after being well above earlier
in the year--and prices tended upward through early September.
However, since then (and particularly in late October),cattle prices
have declined, owing in part to the unexpectedly large supplies of
pork. Record crops have continued to exert downward pressure on
prices of corn and soybeans. However, prices of wheat have tended
to stabilize following the earlier sharp decline, and cotton prices
have risen in the face of a short crop.
Consumer prices. The consumer price index increased only
0.2 per cent in September as food prices declined somewhat more than

II -23
seasonally while prices of other commodities and of services increased
sharply further. From April to August, when food prices were rising,
the increase in the CPI averaged 0.35 per cent a month--or an annual
rate of over 4 per cent.
The decline in average retail food prices in September
reflected decreases for fresh vegetables and eggs. Meat prices
were unchanged, where as they usually rise seasonally. Recent declines
in livestock and meat prices at wholesale may be reflected in lower
retail prices for red meat after September. Chickens and turkeys
are also plentiful and prices have been declining at wholesale.
Average retail prices of commodities other than food,
which were rising sharply in the spring and summer, showed another
spurt in September. Apparel prices showed twice the usual large
seasonal rise with the introduction of new fall and winter lines,
and used car prices rose further (and contraseasonally), owing in
part to the spill-over to used car markets of limited supplies of
new cars., Prices of most other consumer items continued to rise--
though less rapidly than for apparel and used cars. Altogether,
average retail prices of non-food commodities increased at an annual
rate of 4 per cent from March through September, and another sizable
gain seems probable for October with the introduction in the index
of higher prices for 1968 model autos and perhaps a further contra-
seasonal rise in used car prices.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL SITUATION
Bank credit. Bank credit expanded at an estimated 11 per
cent annual rate in October, compared with 8 per cent in September
when there was no new Treasury issue to underwrite. The expansion in
bank loans and investments net of acquisitions of Treasury securities
has shown considerably less variation, with most of the remaining
greater growth in July and August reflecting sizable loans to Government
security dealers associated with Treasury financings.

ness.

As in September, both security and nonbank financial loans
increased relatively rapidly last month and accounted for more than
one-third of the increase in total loans. The strength in loans to
Government security dealers reflected in large part distribution of
the new tax bills, but miscellaneous security loans also continued to
increase sharply. The further growth of finance company loans appar-
ently resulted from the narrowing gap between the cost of market and
bank financing. Other loan categories expanded at about the moderate
pace of other recent months.

III -3
As has been the case since late summer, relatively modest
loan demands led banks to continue to add to their portfolio of liquid
assets in October. Banks took essentially all of the $4.5 billion
issue of tax anticipation bills early in the month, but reportedly
quickly sold off a sizable portion of these bills. However, at weekly
reporting banks, total holdings of bills did not decline particularly
rapidly after the financing, as the attractive yields on shorter bills
and the continued bank demand for liquidity led banks to add further
to their short-bill holdings. With loan demands light relative to
deposit inflows, acquisition of other securities also accelerated from
the low September pace to about a 19 per cent rate in October. Pur-
chases of both municipals and participation certificates were particu-
larly large at weekly reporting banks outside of New York.
Bank deposits. Total time and savings deposit inflows in
October were maintained at the reduced 12.0 per cent annual rate of
September, compared to the over 17 per cent rate in the first 8 months
of the year. Most of the slower growth in total time and savings
deposits in the last two months has been accounted for by negotiable
CD's. In September, banks lost over $800 million of CD's, in large
part due to tax and dividend payments. In October, they replaced only
about $200 million of this run-off--considerably less than previous
monthly increases; essentially all of the October growth occurred in
New York City. The attrition and slow subsequent growth in outstand-
ings occurred despite upward movements in CD rates of 10 to 40 basis

III -4
points since late August. Moreover, although banks are generally
offering 5.50 per cent for over 6 months CD's, the slow October
expansion may reflect the growing lack of competitiveness of certif-
icates in this maturity range. For example, the more liquid June tax
bills were yielding about 5.50 per cent, on an investment basis, in
late October. In the 3 to 6 month maturity range, CD's still remain
relatively attractive; but with loan demands expected to be less than
exuberant in the near-term, banks are evidently not aggressively seek-
ing funds in this maturity range, even though sales of longer CD's are
becoming more difficult. Despite the higher costs of Euro-dollars,
banks borrowed, on average, about $325 million from their foreign
branches in October to supplement their resources. No information is
available on the maturity of such borrowing.
As far as can be determined, inflows of IPC time and savings
depositsother than CD's continue relatively strong. While inflows at
weekly reporting banks in the last couple of months are somewhat below
the pace earlier in the year, the degree of deceleration appears modest.

The money stock--after virtually no growth in September--
increased at about a 5.5 per cent annual rate in October. However, a
large part of this expansion reflected a run-off of Treasury balances
in the second half of September and early October prior to payment for
the new tax bills. Over the first 10 months of the year the money
stock has grown at a 6.8 per cent rate, but during the September-
October period the rate of growth has slowed to a 3.0 per cent rate.
This slow down probably reflects the pull of higher short-term yields,
as well as the slower pace of loan demand.
U.S, Government securities market. Yields on Treasury notes
and bonds have risen considerably further in recent weeks, although
the advance was interrupted briefly following the Treasury refunding
announcement in late October and the refunding was well received.
Currently, yields on long-term Treasury bonds are well above their
highest levels of 1966 and have approached their 1966 highs in the 5-
year area. Treasury bill rates have also risen in recent weeks, as
the table shows.

The continued advance in Treasury bond yields has occurred
against a background of decreasing hopes for tax increase legislation
this year and attendant expectations of a shift by the System to a
firmer monetary policy. Narket psychology has also been weakened by
several large new additions to the corporate bond calendar and by
official indications that $1.0 to $1.5 billion of participation certif-
icates will be brought to market before year-end.
The Treasury's November refunding has added to market
supplies in the short and intermediate-term coupon areas. The Treasury
sold to private investors about $3.2 billion of new 15-month, 5-5/8 per
cent notes and $1.6 billion of new 7-year, 5-3/4 per cent notes. This
cash refinancing served to pay off about $2.6 billion of publicly-held

III -7
maturing issues and to raise some $2.2 billion ofnew money. A strong
interest developed in the 7-year notes which attracted about $14
billion of subscriptions from the public and which were subjected to
an unusually low allotment ratio of 7-1/2 per cent on subscriptions
over $100,000. The new 15-month notes drew subscriptions totaling
about $8 billion from private investors and the Treasury set an allot-
ment ratio of 36 per cent on this issue.
While the terms of the refunding initially proved attractive
to investors, market enthusiasm for the new notes faded with the clos-
ing of subscription books and considerable selling pressure developed
from temporary holders, especially holders of the new 7-year notes.
This selling contributed to the rapidly deteriorating market atmosphere
in the first part of November. Dealers were able to uncover some off-
setting market demand, albeit at declining prices and partly on switches
out of outstanding issues. The market was also relieved of a sizable
amount of the new 7-year notes by Treasury Investment Account purchases.
The most recent data indicate that dealers held about $115 million of
the new 7-year notes on November 6, down from original allotments esti-
mated at about $280 million. Dealer holdings of the new 15-month notes
were a more sizable '$430 million.
The recent rise in Treasury bill rates has been influenced
to a major extent by the deterioration in longer-term debt markets.
Despite generally good market demand for bills, supplemented by System
purchases in the market totaling nearly $500 million in late October

III -8
and early November, dealers have been willing sellers of bills at
rising yields. Most of the upward pressure on bill rates has been in
the longest maturities which were most affected by bond market develop-
ments and by the anchor issue in the Treasury refunding. Yields on
bills maturing this year have actually declined somewhat in recent
trading sessions. The bearishness on future yield trends no doubt has
led many investors to place a premium on the most liquid money market
instruments.
In other short-term debt markets, some additional yield
increases have occurred since the third week of October, as the table
shows.

Treasury finance. The completion of the November refunding
in which the Treasury raised about $2 billion of net new money will
probably mark the last major Treasury financing utilizing direct debt
this year. Additional cash will continue to be raised through $100
million additions to weekly and monthly bill auctions and, as noted,
through the sale of $1.0 to $1.5 billion of participation certificates.
Total cash raised over the second half of 1967 (including sales of
participation certificates) is expected to approximate $17 to $17-1/2
billion, some $5 billion more than the previous postwar record set in
the second half of 1959,
The Treasury's next major financing operation is expected
to be in January. The market expects additional sales of June tax
bills at that time.
Social Security bill. The Senate Finance Committee is
expected to complete action on a new Social Security bill by November 8.
The bill was changed a number of times during the Committee's delibera-
tions. At one point the bill provided for a substantial increase in
employment tax rates, but on November 6 the Committee voted to retain
the present 8.8 per cent tax rate until 1969. Tax liabilities are
expected to increase, however, during 1968 through an expansion in the
tax base. The larger tax base will increase tax collections in the
latter part of 1968, while larger benefit payments are scheduled to
begin in February.
At this juncture it is too early to predict what the final
outcome will be in regard to the Social Security bill.

III -12
Corporate and municipal bond markets. After a brief late
October respite in which yields generally declined slightly, bond
markets have most recently weakened again and yields on new corporate
and municipal issues have resumed their advance. At current levels,
new issue yields in both markets are at, or close to, the highs reached
in mid-October, and some utility issues carrying 5-year call protection
have exceeded the previous peak yields for comparable offerings. The
corporate new issue series in the yield table overstates the magnitude
of the yield decline due to the heavy weight given to industrial offer-
ings with 10-year call protection. Also, the lagging seasoned municipal
yield series do not yet reflect the recent upward yield tendency in the
market for new municipal issues during the two most recent weeks.

The short-lived yield decline in late October was apparently
chiefly a reaction to the sharp run-up of yields earlier in the month.
Investor demand was whetted by the historically high yields offered on
several key issues, such as the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey and
the New York City bonds. In addition, the initially favorable reception
of the new 7-year, 5-3/4 per cent Treasury note apparently contributed
to a developing view that longer-term yields might be stabilizing. This
market optimism was quickly dissipated in early November, however, when
press reports virtually wrote-off the prospects for any increase in
Federal income tax rates this year and downgraded chances for an increase
even in 1968. At the same time, a continuing build-up in the calendar
of forthcoming corporate bond issues, and the Treasury's announcement
of a prospective offering of longer-term participation certificates
heightened the near-term outlook for renewed general upward pressures
on bond yields.
In the corporate bond market, U.S. Steel's announcement of
plans to sell $225 million of debentures in mid-November also had a
significant impact on market expectations, since it seemed to imply
that the pattern of anticipatory corporate bond financing evident
earlier in October would continue. This issue raised the volume of
corporate debt definitely scheduled for public offering in November to
more than $1.1 billion. And in the final analysis, November volume
may match October's $1.35 billion figure. A reduced volume of stock
offerings expected in November may result, however, in aggregate public
and private bond and stock offerings about $150 million less than the
$2.35 billion floated in October.

III -14
The mix between straight debt and convertible bonds has not
been altered perceptibly since the Board's announced proposal to extend
margin requirements to convertible bonds. Only one small, scheduled
convertible bond has been indefinitely postponed since the announcement
whereas several new issues have been added to the calendar. Two
already scheduled issues (one the large Tenneco offering) have been
changed from rights to regular offerings, however, reportedly to achieve
a broader market among institutional investors. Also, on the new con-
vertible issues that have been sold since October 20, borrowing costs
have increased--by roughly 1/4 of a percentage point--and some other
terms--such as the conversion price--have had to be liberalized in
order to elicit a favorable investor response. In the first 10 months
of 1967, gross offerings of convertible bonds totaled $3.4 billion
including $1.6 billion in the third quarter alone. This compares with
gross offerings of only $1.9 billion for all of 1966.

Recent municipal bond offerings have generally been well
received by investors since mid-October. Dealers' advertised inven-
tories presently aggregate about $330 million which reflects, in part,
the increased sales of new issues and in part price cutting on older
issues. A temporary lull in the calendar during the past two weeks
has undoubtedly been a factor in this market as well as strong localized
interest in particular issues (such as the New York City offering).
State and local government bond issues offered during
October aggregated about $925 million, more than $300 million below
September but more than $150 million above October 1966. The monthly
volume would have been substantially larger were it not for more than
$250 million of issues known to have been postponed or cut back in
size. Municipal volume in November is currently estimated at $1.3
billion, well above October and the highest monthly volume since June.
Included in this estimate are $350 million of tentatively scheduled
industrial revenue bonds, which may go even higher in view of additional
plans known to be under discussion. Through October, industrial
revenue bond offerings amounted to $825 million, up from $500 million
for all of 1966. The exceptionally high volume in recent months is
reported to reflect in part anticipatory borrowing as a hedge against
the possibility that restrictive legislation will be passed in 1968.

Corporate profits. Earnings reports now available for large
companies confirm the earlier staff projection of a small increase in
corporate profits (seasonally adjusted) from the second to the third
quarter. In manufacturing, data are presently available only on a
seasonally unadjusted basis and the movement in seasonally adjusted
earnings has to be estimated by relating year-to-year changes to the
level of seasonally adjusted profits in 1966. Third quarter 1967
profits continued to run below a year earlier in almost all manufactur-
ing industries but, despite strikes in the auto and copper industries
and a continued rise in unit labor costs, the over-all year-to-year
decline was slightly narrower in the third quarter than in the second,
as the table below shows. With seasonally adjusted manufacturing
profits practically unchanged between the second and third quarters of
last year, a narrowing of the 1966 to-1967 decline in the third quarter
implies a small rise in seasonally adjusted profits.

In nonmanufacturing, seasonally adjusted profits are
estimated to have remained at about the second quarter level except
for a moderate further rise in the earnings of trade companies. All
in all, a rise in the seasonally adjusted annual rate of profits before
tax, from $78.9 billion in the second quarter to $80.5 billion in the
third, continues to seem reasonable.
Mortgage market developments. With the sharp rise in bond
yields last month, price markdowns in the secondary market for Government-
underwritten home mortgages were considerably larger than in September,
according to unofficial FNMA field reports, with some individual lenders--

III -18
said to have cut back sharply on their new commitments within the past
few weeks. It thus seems probable that in October, the sensitive
secondary market yield series on FHA-insured new-home mortgages
approached still closer to the record level reached toward the end of
last year. Official data on mortgage rates, however, are not yet avail-
able for last month.
While real estate brokers anticipate somewhat higher yields
on home mortgages in coming months, they look for funds for such
mortgages to continue in adequate supply for qualified borrowers,
according to a mid-September mortgage survey of the National Association
of Real Estate Boards. The NAREB findings concerning the future avail-
ability of mortgage funds were similar to the results of the Federal
Reserve Bank survey that was made at about the same time. Both surveys
were taken before the sharp further advance of bond yields of recent
weeks, and comprehensive information is not yet available to judge the
full impact of this development on the pace at which new mortgage
commitments were being made in October.
By the end of September, private lenders had at last
virtually fully regained their mortgage commitment positions held in
January 1966, when the combined volume of outstanding commitments of
the three major reporting institutions reached a postwar peak and when
cash flows at least to thrift institutions were smaller than they are
now. Forward mortgage commitments outstanding were sharply above their
December 1966 low, especially for savings and loan associations, and
also above their April 1967 level, when mortgage yields generally

III -19
reached a low for this year. Judging from available data that cover
both residential and nonresidential mortgages, lenders continued to be
cautious in committing immediately ahead, with a third of all outstand-
ing savings bank mortgage commitments scheduled to mature more than
9 months later. At life insurance companies, three-fifths of total
commitments expected to be taken down within 7 months or more, a some-
what larger share than early in 1966.

As the availability of mortgage funds has recovered through
September of this year, savings and loan associations--traditionally
conventional mortgage lenders--have been placing a growing share of
their funds in Government-underwritten loans which carry more liberal
nonrate terms to borrowers. Since June, yields on FHA and VA mortgages
which may be traded in the nationwide secondary market have equaled or
exceeded average returns on conventional home mortgages which tend to

III -20
reflect local market conditions to a much larger degree. Accelerated
net takings by S&L's of FHA and VA loans during the third quarter,
plus sharply higher net acquisitions by FNNA, more than offset any
lessening of interest by life insurance companies or other types of
lenders in this relatively minor sector of the market.
Market support for Government-underwritten loans from S&L's
and FNMA--which limited the rise in yields on FHA and VA mortgages
during the third quarter--seems likely to continue during the current
quarter. Net savings inflows to S&L's tend to be stronger than new
loan demands at this time of year under normal market conditions, so
that some excess S&L funds may remain available for FHA and VA mortgages
if usual seasonal influences prevail. Also, FNMA purchases of Government-
underwritten mortgages appear certain to remain substantial for some
time. Although offerings to FNMA of FHA and VA loans for purchase
under its secondary market operations declined in September, following
a reduction in FNMArs buying prices, they revived in October as upward
pressures on home mortgage yields intensified. By the week ended
November 2, offerings to FNMA had risen to around $77 million--the
largest weekly volume since the spring of 1966--raising some questions
about how long FNMA could hold to its current schedule of purchase
prices. FNMA's continued substantial purchases under its secondary
market operations, which are ultimately financed by open-market borrow-
ing, will undoubtedly more than offset any decline in loan acquisitions
resulting from the agency's mid-October cut-off of new commitments to

III -21
buy mortgages under certain of its special assistance programs--a step
designed to reduce FNMA's use of Treasury funds for this purpose.
Savings flows to financial intermediaries. The only new
evidence available on savings flows to thrift institutions during
October is for all savings banks in New York State. For the first
time this year these banks experienced a year-to-year drop in their
net inflows, from $114 million last year to $99 million this year. In
October a year ago, however, net inflows were at a record for the month,
slightly above the previous October peak of $112 million reached in
1964 following retirement of the famous Treasury Magig 5's.
This year's October experience is, thus, the third best
October on record for New York State savings banks. Nevertheless, the
year-to-year short fall confirms the impression gained from savings
bank and S&L data already reported for the October reinvestment period,
that the rate of growth in net flows to thrift institutions has moderated
somewhat since summer.
Spreads of yields on some types of market securities over
the maximum rates generally available on passbook accounts at savings
and loan associations are presently nearly as large as the peak spreads
reached in 1966. But so far this is true only for long-term securities
and short-term Federal Agency debt. Spreads between other short-term
rates and maximum S&L passbook rates are still substantially less than
during the 1966 periods of peak pressure on thrift institutions, as the
table shows. While industry spokesmen generally expect some further

III -22
slowing of growth in gross savings inflows over the remaining weeks of
1966, they do not contemplate any major redirection of net flows prior
to the January reinvestment period, even if short-term interest rates
rise further.
Industry observations point to a few longer-run factors
which may help to moderate the general impact of any further increases
in short-term rates on thrift institutions. These include the less
aggressive competition of commercial banks at given ceiling rates on
consumer-type savings accounts, and the fact that much of the interest
sensitive money which left these institutions during 1966 apparently
did not return, although yield spreads favored claims of thrift institu-
tions earlier this year.
Moreover, even if a larger near-term slowdown in savings
flows than is now anticipated should occur, there are several reasons
for believing that the squeeze on thrift institutions and home mortgage
markets would be less extreme than in 1966. In the first place,
seasonally adjusted loan commitments outstanding at S&L's were only
1.9 times larger than seasonally adjusted net inflows in the third
quarter, whereas the backlog of similar commitments outstanding in
March 1966 was 3.8 times the like inflows for that quarter. S&L's in
particular are paying much stricter attention to current money market
developments than during the spring of 1966 and consequently have held
their commitments for new loans in a more nearly sustainable relation
to inflows of funds.

III -23
S&L's have also substantially improved their liquidity during
the past year so that the ratio of their liquid assets (Government
securities plus cash) less all borrowing, to their share capital had
risen to 6.4 per cent at the end of September. This is the highest
level reached by this ratio since mid-1963 and compares with 2.2 per
cent at the end of September 1966. In addition, the Federal Home Loan
Bank System has expanded its own liquid assets substantially, which
are available to meet the borrowing demands of its member S&L's. At
the end of October, the System held liquid assets of more than $1.8
billion, or more than twice the average volume during most of 1966,

1967; and 5.00 per cent since July 1, 1967. S&L certificate accounts
paying 5.25 per cent for $1,000 six-month minimums have been generally
available throughout the country since October 1966. Mutual savings
banks, which generally do not offer certificate accounts, paid 4.50
per cent on passbook accounts prior to July 1966 and have been paying
5.00 per cent since.

III -24
Stock market. Since early October, stock prices have
retreated on a broad front. As a result, the sharp earlier gains
realized in September have now been wholly eliminated and the average
of Dow-Jones industrials, down over 9 per cent from its high, is back
to its early June level. Standard & Poor's composite index of 500
stock prices has declined 6 per cent from its all-time high of 97.59,
reached on September 25, and the American Exchange index has declined
almost as much from a similar high reached on October 9. During the
decline, trading volume has been exceptionally heavy, averaging 10.2
million shares a day on the New York Exchange and a record breaking
6.1 million shares a day on the American Exchange.
A breakdown of stock price movements by industry groupings
shows that less than 20 per cent have advanced since early October.
Among these, the only notable advances were made by the glamour-
industries--electronics, office quipment and color TV--which were
boosted by the advance of certain component issues reporting very
favorable earnings records.
Factors contributing to the recent general weakness of
stock prices have included further widening of the gap between yields
on stocks and bonds, an associated heightening of market concern about
the prospects for tight money if no tax increase in enacted, and general
disappointment over third quarter earnings reports in a number of key
industries. While Federal Reserve announcement of the proposed new
margin regulations has had a pronounced initial impact on convertible
bond prices as expected, the influence on stock prices seems to have
been relatively minor in comparison with the other forces recently con-
tributing to declines.

III -25
The extension of margin requirements under Regulation U to
all bonds convertible into registered stock has forced price reductions
extending to as much as 15 points in some outstanding issues, indicating
the substantial volume of narrowly margined credit that was being used
to support positions in such issues. As a result, a sizable number of
margin calls have been made particularly on the substantial volume of
loans that were made initially through money brokers. Immediately
after the Board's announcement, trading in some convertibles stopped
completely since few buyers could be found to pick up the large over-
hang of sell-orders triggered by the action. At the same time, dealers
showed a strong reluctance to take positions because they feared credit
to support such positions would now have to be margined at 70 per cent.
As prices have dropped, some institutional investors have begun to show
an interest in picking up bargains. But while trading in virtually all
convertibles has now resumed, the convertible market remains generally
weak--due partly to the further decline of stock prices, and to the
continuing uncertainty of dealers concerning their financing.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
U.S. balance of payments. The liquidity deficit in the third
quarter was somewhat larger than previously estimated, partly because
of a revision of the seasonal adjustment that added over $75 million to
the adjusted total. Before seasonal adjustment the deficit for the
three months totaled $1.2 billion, and after the new adjustment for
seasonal factors the deficit, as published, will be nearly $750 million.
The substantial deterioration in the published liquidity deficit from
the $2.1 billion annual rate of the first half to a rate of nearly
$3.0 billion in the third quarter may well stir considerable public
concern.
Since the published liquidity deficits for the first two
quarters were greatly reduced by official "special" transactions,
and such transactions were relatively small in the third quarter,
the balance adjusted for these transactions actually showed some
improvement in the third quarter.
Weekly reports covering the month of October (though subject
to the usual reservations about accuracy and month-end overlaps) show
an extraordinarily large liquidity deficit-on the order of $900 mil-
lion. October deficits have averaged about $600 million over the
past five years, and most of the excess over that rate this year can
be accounted for by a reduction of about $260 million in U.K. holdings
of U.S. Government agency securities. These agency securities had
been acquired when the U.K. Treasury switched out of investments in
U.S. corporate stocks, and at that time were counted for balance of

IV -2
payments purposes as nonliquid, nonofficial holdings so as to avoid
any impact on the measures of the deficit. Now as they are converted
into liquid dollar holdings there will be a worsening of the deficit
on both measures.
Other October transactions, some conjectural, that would
tend to keep the deficit large are (1) the last spate of travel ex-
penditures for Expo 67, (2) a continued large flow to Israel, (3) a
larger than usual volume of new Canadian bonds sold in this market,
(4) temporarily swollen outflows of capital from banks and industrial
concerns anticipating the announcement of possible changes in the
voluntary programs, and (5) perhaps some borrowing by Canadian banks
at the end of their fiscal year to enlarge their balance sheet totals.
Using the October total derived from weekly figures, it
appears that the deficit for the first ten months of the year not
counting the reductions by means of special transactions (but with-
out seasonal adjustment) was about $2-1/2 billion. The special
transactions for the year through October totaled about $1.0 billion.
The alternative official reserve transactions balance has
exhibited wide fluctuations this year, and was in surplus by about
$400 million (seasonally adjusted) in the third quarter. The
increase in liabilities to commercial banks abroad and other private
foreign accounts, which serves to reduce the deficit on this basis,
amounted to $1.3 billion in the quarter, coming primarily in July
and August. Nearly $900 million of the increase was in liabilities
of U.S. banks to their foreign branches.

IV -3
In October there was a continued substantial increase in
privately-held short-term assets in the U.S., including an increase
of perhaps $100 million in amounts due to foreign branches of U.S.
banks, and an increase of about $200 million in holdings of Canadian
banks. Nevertheless the official settlements balance registered a
deficit (not seasonally adjusted) of approximately $300 million in
October. The German purchase of a second $125 million nonliquid
Treasury note improved the liquidity balance but had no effect on
the official settlements balance. The shift of U.K. official
holdings out of Agency bonds enlarged the deficit on both measures
as noted above.
Bank lending. From January through September bank-reported
short-term claims on foreigners increased by a net amount of $488 mil-
lion (not seasonally adjusted) whereas in the same period last year
there was a net reduction of $315 million. This net shift in flows
of $800 million has been a large factor in the worsening of the
deficit this year. Nearly $700 million of the shift was in claims
on Japan, and there has also been a considerable outflow this year
to Mexico and the Philippines.
Using the seasonal adjustments employed in the balance of
payments accounts -- which may now be questionable because of the
disturbances caused by the voluntary programs and variations in
borrowing practices by Japanese banks -- the contraseasonal
unadjusted outflow of $76 million in the third quarter is greatly
amplified to a seasonally adjusted outflow of about $290 million.

IV -4
Again, this reflects a moderate draw down on U.S. bank financing by
Japan, whereas for some years past Japanese borrowers have tended to
make large repayments in the third quarter.
Outstanding term loans to foreigners by U.S. banks were
reduced by about $250 million in the first three quarters of the year,
slightly more than in the same period of 1966. Though there was a
resumption of net outflows in the third quarter, it was concentrated
in loans to a few Latin American countries while inflows continued
from other areas. In the fourth quarters of the past two years there
have been net repayments of these credits of over-one-year maturity.
The net increase in bank-reported claims of all maturities this year
through September, amounting to $220 million, exceeded the amount
reported under the VFCR largely because of increases in claims of
U.S. agencies of foreign banks and of bank customers.
Under the revised VFCR, banks have only a few hundred mil-
lion of leeway for foreign lending available for use in the current
quarter. This limitation, joined with the already large drawdowns
on Japanese credit lines, and with the likelihood that U.S. banks
will use their foreign branches increasingly to take care of foreign
business, suggests that total U.S. bank credit outflow this quarter
may be relatively small.
I'ternational transactions in securities. Net U.S.
purchases of foreign securities in the first nine months of this
year were about $1/2 billion higher than in the same period of
1966, thus adding further to the pressures on the overall balance.

IV -5
In the third quarter alone the net outflow this year was some $400 mil-
lion (unadjusted), whereas in the third quarter last year there was
very little net outflow. Much of the year-to-year increase was in
purchases of new issues of foreign bonds; this year though September
such purchases totaled $1.2 billion, about $200 million more than last
year, and the fourth quarter total this year will considerably exceed
the $200 million of last year. For the year there will be substantial
increases in bond sales in the U.S. by the World Bank and by Israel,
and the Canadian total will probably exceed last year's record of over
$900 million.
U.S. purchases of foreign equity securities have also
increased this year. Whereas in the first nine months of 1966 there
was a net liquidation producing a net inflow of $150 million, this
year there has been a small net outflow on this account.
On the other hand, foreign purchases of U.S. corporate
stocks (excluding transactions for U.K. account) have resulted in
large receipts this year, especially in the third quarter when they
amounted to nearly $300 million.
U.S. foreign trade. The U.S. foreign trade surplus in
September dropped substantially from the high August rate as imports
increased while exports fell. For the entire third quarter, the
trade surplus on a balance of payments basis was at an annual rate
of $4.4 billion, slightly below the second quarter rate. As mentioned
in the last Green Book, the Arab-Israeli war and the copper strike
affected both the second and third quarter trade figures. With

IV -6
adjustment for these special events, the trade surplus would have
declined more from the second to the third quarter.
Exports in the third quarter showed only minor variations
from the pattern of the preceeding quarter. Agricultural exports fell
sharply in the first quarter of this year and have remained relatively
low. Nonagricultural exports expanded rapidly in the early part of
the year and have stabilized at this high plateau. Shipments to
Canada continued to drift downward; deliveries of automotive vehicles
there may have been slowed by the Ford strike. The pronounced, but
temporary, decline in exports to the Arab countries was, of course,
a direct effect of the Arab-Israeli war.

The entire increase in sales to Western Europe in the third
quarter is attributable to emergency deliveries of crude oil following--

IV -7
the closing of the Suez Canal. Shipments of other nonagricultural
products to these countries are still higher than a year earlier.
Deliveries of civilian aircraft were particularly heavy in the past
six months. In addition, exports of machinery in the first three
quarters of this year were considerably higher than in the corre-
sponding periods of a year ago. Agricultural exports to Europe
through September, however, were far below those in January-
September 1966, reflecting improved crops in Europe and other
supplying countries and some tightness in domestic supplies.
Shipments to Japan continued to expand in third quarter but at
much slower pace than in the previous quarter.
Imports in the third quarter were at an annual rate of
$26.3 billion, only slightly lower than in the second quarter.
With the advance in GNP, imports of finished products remained high
while the decline in industrial materials has moderated. Imports
of petroleum were below normal by about $0.3 billion as world
petroleum supplies were rearranged to compensate for the loss of
Mid-East oil. Total imports, after adjustment for this shortfall,
were about 3.4 per cent of total GNP in the third quarter, only
marginally below the peak rate of 3.5 per cent in the last half
of 1966 when domestic economic activity was stronger, business
inventories were expanding sharply and the utilization of manu-
facturing capacity was 90 per cent, compared with less than 84 per
cent in the third quarter of this year. Imports of finished
consumer and capital goods have remained high.

Imports of iron and steel-mill products advanced further in the
third quarter, approaching the record rate of last fall. Imports of other
metals, though sustained by heavy arrivals of refined copper, declined
further in total. Other industrial materials, particularly textile
supplies and building materials, which had been sluggish or declining
since the middle of last year, turned up moderately in the third quarter,
reflecting the expansion in domestic textile output and residential
construction. Imports of machinery in the third quarter recovered
sharply from the unusually low value of the preceding quarter, possibly
reacting to restoration of the investment tax credit last spring and
to further gains in domestic outlays for producers' equipment.; --

IV -9
Reserve changes in other industrial countries. Further strains
on Britain's net reserve position and a large increase in Italian official
foreign exchange reserves were two major developments in the third quarter.
Partly for seasonal reasons and partly in consequence of sterling's
renewed weakness during the summer, the pattern of total European Economic
Community official reserve gains this year has resembled last year's, with
large gains in the third quarter after much smaller accretions in the
first half year.
The combined changes in reserves and in net assets of commercial
banks in EEC countries amounted to somewhat over $700 million in the third
quarter, nearly twice the quarterly average in the first half of 1967.
This alternative measure of reserve and liability changes, given in the
second table, is the counterpart of the EEC's surplus of international
receipts on current and nonbank-capital accounts. Both this summer and
in the summer of 1966 this balance may have been swollen by movements out
of sterling into EEC currencies on the part of businesses and investors,
As the commercial banks of the area did not, in the aggregate and on
balance, increase their net external assets during the third quarter, the
entire surplus accrued to official reserves.
The increase in U.S. banks' liabilities to their foreign
branches amounted to nearly $900 million in the third quarter, reflect-
ing large borrowings by the branches in the Euro-dollar market. As the
German and other continental European commercial banks were on balance no
longer switching large sums out of domestic into foreign assets, as they
had earlier in the year, it is clear that funds moving out of sterling

into dollars contributed heavily to supplies in the Euro-dollar market.
Such movements reflected both the low state of confidence in sterling
and the emergence of covered interest rate differentials unfavorable to
sterling as a result initially, of the advance in Euro-dollar rates in
May and June. With the discount on forward sterling widening since then,
from about 1/2 per cent per annum at midyear and 0.7 per cent at the end
of September, to more than 1 per cent recently, the unfavorable covered
differentials have not been eliminated by the October 19 rise in Bank
Rate from 5-1/2 to 6 per cent.
The overall development of Common Market payments this year
was influenced by the shift in Italy from deficit in the first half to
surplus in the third quarter. The seasonally high inflow of tourist
receipts was a major factor in this shift, but the change was much more
than seasonal. Among nonseasonal elements, changes in capital flows were
important. Shifts of funds from sterling to lira assets have been reported,
and Italian exporters have been borrowing abroad, especially in Switzerland,
because of favorable interest rate differentials. Also, a very favorable
shift in leads and lags in trade payments seems to have occurred in August
and September, particularly as regards repatriation of export receipts.
In addition, there have been reports of inflows of funds from abroad into
Italian shares. Expansion of activity in the Italian economy has been
continuing.
Net gold and foreign assets of the Bank of Italy rose by about
$500 million in the third quarter, and appear to have increased further
by more than $100 million in October. To limit the size of its uncovered
dollar holdings, the Bank of Italy has recently twice asked the System to

IV -12
purchase dollars from it. For this purpose, the System drew $100 million
evquvalent of lire under the swap line with the Bank'of Italy on October 17,
and a further $100 million on November 2, bringing the outstanding lira
drawings to $300 million.
Germany's surplus on current and nonbank-capital account was
smaller in the third quarter than in preceding quarters or than in the
corresponding period a year ago. While Germany's trade surplus continued
to run at the record annual rate of over $4 billion through July-August,
net outpayments on services, grants, and official capital accounts were
large. Moreover, there has been a shift from large inflows of private non-
bank capital last year to outflows this year -- already reaching substantial
magnitude in the second quarter. This shift reflects the change in the
German credit situation, with German borrowers now repaying foreign loans
taken up during the preceding period of credit stringency. Also trans-
actions in fixed-interest securities are again producing net outflows.
German commercial banks during the first half of the year placed
large amounts of funds in short-term foreign investments, and the Bundesbank's
net gold and foreign exchange reserves actually fell somewhat in that period.
In the third quarter, however, the outflow of commercial bank funds slowed.
The Bundesbank's net gold and foreign exchange position increased by about
$200 million in the four months July-October.
The outlook for the German balance of payments is for continued
surplus. Although imports were up strongly in June-August, responding to
the upturn in industrial activity, new export orders have also picked up
and exports have begun to rise again. As advancing economic activity in

IV -13
Germany leads to increasing domestic credit demands it is to be expected
that private capital outflows will shrink again. However, German in-
dustrial production in September was about unchanged from August, and
so remained well below the high July level. The third-quarter average
was up 1-1/2 per cent from the second quarter's.
France this year avoided a balance-of-payments deficit in the
third quarter, often an unfavorable season for the French accounts. The
trade deficit, which was fairly large in the latter part of 1966 and early
1967, has been reduced by a decline in imports. The overall surplus has
reflected continued net capital inflow, aided by flotations of bond issues
of nationalized and private French industries on the Euro-bond market. In
the first ten months of 1967 such issues amounted to $130 million. In the
face of the domestic economic slowdown, French interest rates have been
kept relatively high.
Of the smaller European countries, Sweden and the Netherlands
both have had better payments positions this year than last. In both
countries, slowdowns in economic growth resulting from stabilization
programs have led to a leveling off in imports; export growth, although
not strong, has been somewhat better maintained. The result in each case
has been a significant improvement in the trade balance which, in turn,
accounts in large part for the improvement in the overall balance.
Outside Europe, Canada's international accounts shifted sharply
from deficit in the first half of the year to a large surplus in the third
quarter which, however, is not expected to persist. The third-quarter
surplus appears to have arisen primarily from heavy tourist receipts --the

IV -14
Canadian government now estimates a net payments gain for the full year
of about $400 million from Expo-67 -- and from increased capital inflows.
Wheat exports in the third and fourth quarters are running smaller than
in the first half of 1967.
As Canadian interest rates have risen strongly since last spring,
the flow of long-term capital to Canada has increased. During the third
quarter, Canada offered about $325 million in bonds in the United States.
Rising long-term rates in this country, far from discouraging the flow,
have encouraged anticipatory borrowings. A further $325 million of Canadian
bond flotations is expected in the New York market in October-November
alone -- but payments on these issues may carry forward into 1968.
Official Canadian reserves rose a little in the third quarter.
In October, despite attempts to keep them down through the use of market
swaps and purchases of Canadian and IBRD bonds in the United States, they
rose further by about $80 million. This put total reserves slightly over
the limit of $2,544 million agreed upon with the United States in exchange
for Canada's IET exemption.
The Bank of Canada has recently persuaded the large chartered
banks to lower deposit rates by about two-thirds of one per cent. The
aim is to lower business borrowing costs in the Canadian economy, currently
suffering rising unemployment with substantial price inflation. The govern-
ment is expected shortly to announce a tax increase and to introduce some
form of incomes policy.
In Japan, the continued expansion of demand has led to steady
import growth. Exports stayed flat during the first half year, and a
very sizable import surplus consequently developed. Nevertheless, reserve

IV -15
losses were largely avoided in that period, as the commercial banks
borrowed heavily in the Euro-dollar market and elsewhere. In the third
quarter official reserves experienced an appreciable decline. Imports
continued to exceed exports, but an upturn in exports appeared to be
emerging. Japanese exports to the United States showed considerable
strength in September.

APPENDIX A: THE FORD-UAW SETTLEMENT*
The Ford Motor Company and the United Automobile Workers
signed a three year contract on October 22, 1967. A return to large-
scale operations, however, was delayed until the week of November 6
by unresolved issues at the local level. The total cost of the
contract for the three years is estimated at between 88 cents and
$1.01 an hour, depending on the amount of cost-of-living adjustment
and on the cost of certain fringe benefits over the life of the contract.
This works out to an average annual rate of increase (compounded) of
5.8 -6.6 per cent, using as a base the pre-strike average hourly com-
pensation figure of $4.80 for wages and fringes.
Wages. The largest proportion of the contract costs is for
direct and indirect wage increases. A general wage rise of 20 cents
an hour was provided in the first year; an additional 3 per cent
deferred increase (averaging 11 cents a year) was granted in each of
the next two years. In addition, a "roll-up" estimated at 10 cents
an hour reflects the secondary effects on overtime and on shift
differentials of the rise in base pay. Skilled workers were granted
an extra and immediate increase of 30 cents an hour. These workers
comprise an estimated one-sixth of the work force, and the differential
is thus equivalent to about 5 cents an hour in wages for all workers.
Cost-of-living allowance. An important feature of the new
contract was the ceiling put on cost-of-living adjustments. No cost-
of-living adjustment was granted in the initial year of the contract.
Annual adjustments will be given for the next two years with a minimum
allowance of 3 cents and a maximum of 8 cents an hour each year.
Workers will receive one cent for each rise of 0.4 points in the
consumer price index. Thus, an eight cent maximum adjustment cor-
responds to a rise in the CPI of 3.2 points (somewhat less than 3
per cent, given the present level of the index). The union has the
option of permanently waiving a penny of any cost-of-living adjustment
in excess of 6 cents in return for an additional holiday to begin in
1970.
Nonwage benefits. The total cost of nonwage benefits is not
certain, but has been estimated at about 25-28 cents an hour. This may
overstate the actual cost since in the past funded pension and other
nonwage costs frequently have been overestimated because growth in the
fund assets has usually been substantially greater than anticipated.
The most important of the nonwage benefits is an increase in the
basic pension rate from $4.25 to $5.25 per month per year of service.
After January 1, 1969, the pension rate will rise to $5.50, $5.75

and Trade Section, Division of Research and Statistics.

or $6.00 depending on the worker's pay level. Many assembly line
workers will also receive an extra twelve minutes of relief time
a day, making a total of 48 minutes. An additional paid holiday will
be given at Christmas to provide a long weekend. The contract agree-
ment also provides higher life insurance ($13,000 maximum instead of
$11,500), company paid "Medicare" fees ($3.00 a month), improved
medical and surgical benefits, and a company paid drug plan.
The improved guaranteed annual wage protection provided
in the new contract is essentially an expansion of the existing
supplementary unemployment benefit program. However, the new pro-
visions will not require an increased contribution by the company
which will continue to pay 5 cents an hour into the fund, as in the
prior contract. Contributions are halted when the fund reaches a
specified maximum. The guaranteed annual wage provides laid-off
workers with seven years seniority a full year of benefits at 95 per
cent of after-tax pay, less a $7.50 weekly deduction. For short work-
weeks, 80 per cent of regular gross weekly pay is guaranted for both
scheduled and unscheduled short workweeks.
Some implications. While the new Ford contract tends to
confirm a growing trend in industry toward wage and fringe benefit
increases in the neighborhood of 6 per cent per year, its distinctive
feature is the emphasis of an immediate, substantial money wage
increase with a considerable impact on production costs and current
consumption expenditures. This is in sharp contrast to the previous
auto contract in 1964. In that contract, no direct money wage increase
was granted in the first year and a high proportion of the total
package was in pension and other fring benefits.
The new contract terms will set the pattern for the G.M.
and Chrysler farm equipment and auto parts contracts (still to be
negotiated this year) and is also likely to have an important
influence on other major contract negotiations, in such industries as
cans, steel, aluminum, and aerospace, bituminous coal mining, shipping
and railroads.
The first year cash increase of 25-30 cents (including roll-
up costs and higher wages for skilled workers) amounts to over 7 per
cent of money wages, probably higher than the rate of productivity
gain in the industry and well above first year increases received by
workers in other major manufacturing contracts negotiated earlier
this year. However, in nonmanufacturing activities, particularly in
railroads and in construction, first-year wage increases of 6 per cent
or more have been negotiated,
