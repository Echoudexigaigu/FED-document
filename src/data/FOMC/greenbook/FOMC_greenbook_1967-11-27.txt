SELECTED ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
The Domestic Economy
The gross national product rose at an annual rate of $16
billion in the third quarter to a level of $791.2 billion, about $1
billion higher than the preliminary Commerce estimates carried in the
last Greenbook. Final sales were reduced $1.2 billion because of lowered
estimates for consumer expenditures and defense outlays. Inventory
investment, on the other hand, was revised upward by $2.3 billion to
show accumulation at the rate of $3.8 billion as compared with $0.5
billion in the second quarter.
The saving rate remained at about 7 per cent of disposable
income. Revisions in consumer expenditures--which lowered purchases
of goods and raised outlays for services--resulted in a net downward
revision in total consumer outlays of half a billion dollars--to a level
of $495.3 billion.
Defense spending rose by only $700 million, annual rate, in
the third quarter, or about half the increase estimated earlier.
However, the fourth quarter increase in defense outlays is expected to
be larger than the third, even aside from the expected pay-raise.
Revisions in expenditures for fixed business investment,
residential construction, and net exports were minor.
There was no revision in the GNP deflator, which rose at an
annual rate of 3.8 per cent from the second to the third quarter.

1/ Estimates carried in the November 8th Greenbook.

It is estimated that the November industrial production
index will increase at least one full point from the preliminary
October figure of 156.2 per cent, reflecting principally the resumption
of production after termination of strikes. If this increase is
realized, the November index still would be 2 points or so below the
December 1966 peak.
The October decline of one-half point was due primarily to
a work stoppage in the nonelectrical machinery industry and a 5 per
cent decline in crude oil production, as output changes in most other
industries were small and about offsetting. In early November, crude
oil output stabilized at the October level and the work stoppages at
Ford and Caterpillar have been settled. The estimated November increase
in production of autos, trucks, and parts will amount to about .7 of
one point of the total production index, about one-half of the earlier
loss from the Ford strike. If output in the nonelectrical machinery
industry recovers to the September level, it will add .3 of one point
to the November index. In addition, steel ingot production rose 3 per
cent in early November and is likely to raise the total index slightly.
Other available weekly production data do not suggest either output
declines or increase for the products they represent.
New orders received by manufacturers of durable goods fell
3.0 per cent in October. This was the second consecutive decline and
the third in the last four months. Most of the decline can be attributed
to the Ford strike. Motor vehicle orders and shipments were down 16 per
cent after falling 18 per cent the previous month. When the motor

vehicle industry is excluded, durable goods orders in October were
still down 0.8 per cent. Declines were recorded for iron and steel,
nonferrous metals, and machinery and equipment. Aircraft and fabricated
metal products were the only industries in which orders increased.
Unfilled orders edged up 0.5 per cent in October continuing
the rise that resumed in May. Nearly all the increase in the latest
month came in the aircraft industry.

Business inventory accumulation in August was revised
sharply upward, to total nearly $800 million, and then in September it
dropped back to $150 million. The book value increase now reported for
the third quarter was at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $4.8
billion, compared with $0.3 billion in the second quarter and with the
$18.8 billion peak reached in the fourth quarter 1966. The spurt in
total business inventory accumulation in the third quarter came mainly
in the auto sector but all other manufacturing and trade industries
combined also showed some pick-up in the rate of accumulation.

The total business stock-sales ratio, which had declined
moderately in the spring, edged up between June and September--to 1.56
compared with averages of 1.48 in 1966 and 1.46-1.47 in 1964 and 1965.
Private housing starts, which were revised downward moderately
for September, rose in October to an annual rate of 1.5 million. The
rate was somewhat higher than projected and virtually matched the fourth
quarter of 1965 average. Even if there is some decline in November and
December--as seems possible on technical grounds--the fourth quarter
average will be up significantly from the 1.4 million in the third
quarter.
Multifamily starts again dominated the increase in October,
more than doubling the unusually low rate reached a year earlier and the
highest since mid-1964. Building permits also rose further in October,
with the rise greater for multifamily starts than for single family
units. All regions showed some rise.

Personal income, at $636 billion (annual rate) in October,
was up by only $1-1/2 billion over the month, the smallest monthly
increase since last April. The slackening of personal income growth
in both September and October reflected very largely the impact on
manufacturing output and payrolls of strikes which affected autos,
machinery and metals; manufacturing payrolls were off by $1/2 billion
in October.
More rapid growth in wage and salary disbursements, and in
personal income, may be anticipated in November and over the next
several months. The settlement of several major strikes--with the
attendant recovery of hours of work and employment in the high wage
auto, metals and machinery industries--along with the impact of the
large wage settlements in autos, should have the effect of raising
earnings significantly in the manufacturing sector.
Wholesale prices of industrial commodities, which increased
at an annual rate of 3 per cent from mid-July to mid-September, showed
a similar large increase from mid-September to mid-October. After mid-
October, announcements of price increases diminished considerably, and
the over-all price advance for industrial commodities may have slowed.
(The BLS preliminary estimate for mid-November and the final October
figures are to be released November 29.)
Main features of the October rise in the BLS industrial
commodity average included: (1) an increase of more than 2 per cent
in prices of autos and trucks, with the introduction of new models;
(2) a pronounced rise in inorganic chemicals, as a result of which the index

-7-
for the chemicals group increased moderately following 4 months ok
decline; and (3) a decline in prices of lumber and plywood and gasoline-
in part owing to seasonal influences.
Following devaluation of the pound, prices of basic commodities
in the United Kingdom rose by about the amount of the devaluation.
Little effect of the British devaluation on U.S. prices has been evident
as yet, although some farm commodities tended to weaken further with
prospects of reduced exports to the U.K.
The Domestic Financial Situation
As measured by the bank credit proxy (adjusted to include
Euro-dollar borrowing), growth in member bank credit over the first
three weeks of November was somewhat less than the average pace of
September and October, and for the month as a whole, is expected to be
at about a 10 per cent annual rate. Euro-dollar borrowing expanded by
about $300 million over the first three weeks of the month--bringing
the level of such borrowing to a new high, and rose about $210 million
further at New York banks in the statement week just past.
At weekly reporting banks, credit growth was reflected
mainly in increased holdings of investments, allowing for the usual
seasonal changes. These banks made smaller than usual reductions in
their holdings of Treasury issues over the early weeks of the month
and participated heavily in the attractive November cash refunding--
acquiring for their own account relatively large amounts of both the
15-month and 7-year note. Acquisitions of other securities also were

substantial. Business loan growth remained moderate, as has been the
case since early fall, while miscellaneous security loans and loans to
finance companies continued to show strength.
Time and savings deposit inflows--on a daily average basis--
have continued at their recent reduced pace, and for the month such
deposits are likely to expand at an annual rate of 12 per cent, about
the same as the September-October rate. Fragmentary data suggest that
the recent Treasury note offerings at 5-3/4 per cent did result in some
diversion of individual's savings flows from banks to market instruments.
Negotiable CD's accounted for a substantial part of the recent over-all
growth in time deposits. In contrast to their net decline in the
September-October period, large CD's expanded by about $500 million
over the first three weeks of November, probably reflecting efforts of
banks to prepare for large December maturities.
Offering rates showed little change over this period, and it
is likely that these sales were in relatively short maturities since
maturities of longer than 4 or 5 months had already become noncompetitive
at the 5-1/2 per cent ceiling before the recent rise in the discount
rate. After the discount rate increase, not only did most large banks
raise their prime lending rate to 6 per cent from 5-1/2 per cent but
they also increased their offering rates on shorter maturity CD's. On
November 22, most of the large reporting banks were paying the 5-1/2 per
cent ceiling on maturities of 90-days and over, and a few banks were
offering 5-1/2 per cent on shorter maturities. In the statement week in

which CD rates were raised, New York City banks added $140 million to
their outstandings while Chicago banks lost $60 million of CD's.
The money stock is expected to grow at about a 7.5 per cent
rate in November.
Unsettled market conditions over the past two weeks have
resulted in the postponement of numerous corporate bond issues. Last
week, U.S. Steel postponed its $225 million offering and Tenneco halved
its $200 million issue; and in the current week all of the $165 million
scheduled straight debt offerings have been postponed. Because of
these cut-backs and the failure of additional new issues to be added to
the November calendar, the volume of corporate bonds likely to be
offered in the corporate public market this month is now probably no
more than $700 million. This is only a little over half what some
market participants were previously expecting, and the lowest monthly
volume this year. The expected supply of new corporate issues in
December is still uncertain but it could approximate $900 million, below
most other months this year.
The total volume of municipal bond offerings expected in
November has also been revised downward, but by a much smaller amount
than in the corporate market. Although recent municipal postponements
have numbered nearly as many as in the corporate market, their aggre-
gate volume amounts to only about $100 million; thus the November
estimate for municipals still totals about $1.2 billion--continuing the
record billion dollar a month pace that has persisted most of this year.

-10-
Moreover, the municipal bond calendar for December is expected to total
$1.3 billion. In both November and December municipal volume has been
augmented substantially by industrial revenue issues, with $375 million
offered in November and $350 million or more tentatively scheduled for
December.

Rates on home mortgages were raised in a few metropolitan
areas soon after the System's recent discount increase, according to
informal reports. Earlier in the month, upward pressures on mortgage
rates had continued to intensify, judging from the additional rise in
bond yields and the further slight increase in the already advanced
level of offerings of Government underwritten mortgages to FNMA for
purchase under its secondary market operations.
In October, yields on FHA mortgages sold in the secondary
market edged slightly higher, as average discounts again exceeded
5 points. Contract interest rates on conventional first mortgages
(FHA series) remained unchanged on both new and existing houses, partly
reflecting the continued availability of funds to savings and loan
associations during a period of seasonal easing in loan demands.
During October, as in a number of earlier months this year,
secondary market yields on FHA mortgages--the most sensitive of the
mortgage yield series--increased less than average returns on new
issues of high-grade corporate bonds. As a result, the gross yield
spread favoring home mortgages, which has remained unusually low since
mid-year, narrowed sharply further, as the table shows.

yield spread is FHA yield minus average yield on new issues of
high grade corporate bonds.
More complete (but still preliminary) data now available on
savings flows to depositary-type thrift institutions confirm earlier
indications of a further moderation of inflows in October. While
inflows to both S&L's and savings banks were substantially improved
over a year ago, as the table shows, the performance for both institu-
tions falls short of previous Octobers--particularly at the S&L's. In
addition, savings deposit data for the first half of November at New York
City's 15 largest savings banks, show a $3.5 million or 10 per cent

After declining 6.6 per cent from late September to
November 8, stock prices--as measured by Standard and Poor's composite
index--have since advanced on balance, although the path of this
advance has been quite irregular. Prices broke sharply after announce-
ment of the British devaluation, but then quickly recovered. Trading
has been unusually active, averaging 10 million shares per day since
November 8; and at its most recent level of 93.65, Standard and Poor's
index has erased about 2/5 of its late September to early November
decline.

International Developments
Devaluations. The devaluation of sterling by 14.3 per cent
on November 18, 1967, has been followed by devaluations in relatively
few other countries. All devaluing countries together accounted in
1966 for only 14 per cent of world trade and 11-1/2 per cent of U. S.
trade, as will be seen from the table below, with Britain alone account-
ing for 8-1/2 and 6-1/2 per cent, respectively. Among the countries
that devalued, Denmark and Hong Kong devalued considerably less than
Britain did, while New Zealand devalued more.

gold and U. S. dollars. Thus, the devaluation of the pound.he been
fairly effectively localized and treated as a necessary adjustment

U. K. program. At the same time that it devalued the pound,
the U. K. government announced a broad series of measures to reduce
domestic demand, and thus to limit domestic wage and price increases and
facilitate the massive shift of resources into export and import-compet-
ing industries that will be required if there is to be a substantial
improvement in the U. K. balance of payments. These measures are
intended to open the way to an eventual improvement in the balance of
payments of about b 500 million a year; this would bring the "basic"
balance--on current and long-term capital transactions--from a deficit
estimated at about $550 million (B 200 million) in 1967 to a surplus
of over $700 million (now equivalent to about k 300 million). For
comparison, it may be noted that the largest "basic" surplus recorded
since the early 1950's was that of $420 million (h 151 million) in 1958.
Britain also announced that it was seeking an IMF standby
of $1.4 billion and had obtained additional assistance of about $1-1/2
billion from other central banks in order to tide sterling over any
further period of market uncertainty while the new measures were taking
effect.

-17 -
The new measures taken include the following:
(1) A rise in the Bank of England's discount rate from 6-1/2
to 8 per cent, the highest level since the outbreak of World War I.
(2) A request to banks in the United Kingdom to avoid any
increase until further notice in the level of outstanding advances to
the private sector.
(3) An increase in minimum downpayments on installment
purchases of automobiles from 25 to 33-1/3 per cent, and a reduction
in the maximum repayment period from 36 to 27 months. This reverses
most, but not all, of the easing announced in June and August; before
June, the minimum downpayment was 40 per cent and the maximum repayment
period was 24 months.
(4) A reduction in central government spending in the fiscal
year beginning April 1, 1968, by about b 400 million from planned levels.
(a) Defense spending will be cut B 100 million;
(b) Selective Employment Tax refunds and premium payments to
manufacturers will be reduced L 100 million;
(c) Capital spending in nationalized industries will be cut
L 100 million;
(d) Export rebates, amounting to L 100 million a year, will be
terminated.
(5) An increase in the corporate income tax in the fiscal
year beginning April 1, 1968, from 40 to 42.5 per cent, to yield nearly
1 100 million additional.

-18 -
(6) The Government will continue its current price and
incomes policy, under which wage and price increases can be delayed
by as much as seven months.
The new measures of domestic restraint are expected to
make aggregate domestic demand in Britain about E500 million a year
smaller than it would otherwise have been, and the Government fore-
sees a further "deflationary effect" amounting to about B350 million
as a result of the rise in domestic prices of imported commodities
following the devaluation.
An IMF mission has found that the U.K. program is satis-
factory. It is expected that the Group of Ten countries, meeting
in Paris next Wednesday, November 29, will approve a further activa-
tion of the General Arrangements to Borrow (GAB), and that the IMF
will soon thereafter agree to the requested standby credit of $1.4
billion.
U.S. balance of payments. If the sterling devaluation
and associated U.K. measures are successful, they will have some
adverse effects on the U.S. balance of payments, as well as on the
payments positions of surplus countries. These effects might
ordinarily be considered moderate, but now they will add to what
is already a very large U.S. payments deficit.
Through the end of October, the accumulated deficit on
the liquidity basis was $2.7 billion before seasonal adjustment,

and it would have been about $3.9 billion unadjusted in the absence
of special official transactions, as shown in the table on the next
page. In the first two weeks of November, prior to the devaluation
of sterling, there was an additional unadjusted liquidity deficit
of about $250 million. In the past several years, the final six
weeks of the year have not usually shown large unadjusted deficits,
and have sometimes shown a surplus. However, the outcome this year
may obviously be influenced by the devaluation. The liquidity
deficit would not be affected by shifts of existing foreign liquid
dollar holdings from private to official accounts; but it would be
inflated by any surge in outflows of U.S. capital. All in all, it
seems likely that the published liquidity deficit for the year 1967
as a whole will be at least twice as large as last year's $1.4 bil-
lion. Apart from special transactions, this year's liquidity deficit
may approach $4 billion, compared with $2.9 billion last year.
The situation as measured on the official reserve trans-
actions basis is less certain, since it will be greatly affected
during the remaining weeks of the year by factors influencing U.S.
banks to maintain or change the amount of their liabilities to their
foreign branches. These liabilities reached a record high of $4.8
billion on November 22, and their sharp increases during most of
the period since May served to hold down the official settlements
deficit, and in fact to generate a seasonally adjusted surplus in

J/ Special transactions affecting liquidity deficit are primarily invest-
ments by foreign official and international institutions in nonliquid assets
in the United States, including U.K. official transactions in securities, and
advance repayments of debt to the United States. Of these, advance debt pay-
ments and U.K. official shifts between nonliquid securities and liquid assets
affect the official reserve transactions balance.4(

the third quarter. Nevertheless, for the year through October, there
was a cumulative deficit on the official reserve transactions basis
of roughly $2-1/4 billion before seasonal adjustment. (Special trans-
actions have had only small net effects on this balance this year,)
And it is possible that there will be a very large deficit on this
basis during the remainder of the year, A rise in yields on sterling
assets, general uneasiness among foreigners about holding dollar assets,
plus the usual year-end window-dressing demands in Europe, may put
heavy upward pressures on Euro-dollar rates and cause U.S. banks to
allow a large running-off of Euro-dollar deposits.
Projections of the U.S. balance of payments in 1968 made in
October were for a liquidity deficit before special transactions of
well over $3 billion, ot about the same order of magnitude as this
year. Since special transactions may be more difficult to arrange,
the published deficit would have been expected to show an increase
from this year.
These projections need to be reassessed in the light of the
devaluation of sterling and a few other currencies. A fuller analysis
will be presented in the next Green Book. But it appears that the
adverse net effect on the U.S. trade balance of a successful U.K.
shift into payments surplus, with attendant price changes, might be
of the order of $300 million, and that the adverse trade effect of
other devaluations might be about $50 million. There would also be

-22 -
small adverse effects on net U.S. income from service transactions
and on movements of U.S. private capital. And, as earlier noted,
the adverse effects on the official settlements balance via move-
ments of foreign private liquid funds could be very large.
Short-term capital flows. Indirect evidence -- from
central banks' net daily acquisitions of dollar reserves and spot
exchange market quotations -- suggests that a considerable reflow
into sterling occurred in the week after the devaluation. However,
to Friday, November 24, the reflow was apparently only about half
the size of the (extremely large) outflow from November 1 to
November 17. Large amounts of forward contracts are still out-
standing; at maturity these presumably will cause net reserve losses
for the Bank of England to the extent that the profits that will be
realized are kept in dollars or other non-sterling currencies.
The dollar was strong against Continental European cur-
rencies early in the week, suggesting some movement from those
currencies through the dollar to sterling; later the movement was
reversed, and great strength developed in the exchange rates for
most major Continental currencies. Movements of funds in that
direction were associated with speculation on gold price changes,
not in the sense that such conversions had anything to do with the
financing of gold purchases, but rather that the idea is widely
accepted that strength of gold on free markets equals weakness of
the dollar.

Euro-dollar market. Interest rates in the Euro-dbllar
market changed only narrowly during October and the first part of
November, but rose sharply on Tuesday, November 21. (The London
banks were closed on Monday.) With further advances later in the
week, the 3-month rate on Friday, November 24, stood at 6-3/4 per
cent, up a full percentage point from a week earlier. Call money,
at 5-1/8 per cent, and 1-month deposits, at 5-3/4 per cent, were
each up by about 3/4 of a percentage point, and there were similar
advances in the rates on 6- and 12-month maturities. These changes
were primarily a reaction to the devaluation weekend discount rate
increases -- from 6-1/2 to 8 per cent in Britain, from 5 to 6 per
cent in Canada, and from 4 to 4-1/2 per cent in the United States --
and to associated changes in other interest rates.
Liabilities of New York banks to their branches abroad
were somewhat lower in the first part of the week after devaluation
than on corresponding days a week earlier. This development appeared
consistent with evidence pointing to capital flows into sterling.
Because of disturbance of the intra-weekly variations by the Thanks-
giving Day holiday, the sharp increase in liabilities to branches
that occurred on Wednesday, November 22, is of doubtful significance.
Gold. Demand in the London gold market was heavy on
Tuesday and increased to unparalleled levels as the week went on.
If the Pool follows the usual practice of settling early in the

-24 -
following month, the Treasury gold stock figure on Wednesday,
November 29, will remain unaffected.
U.S. holdings of "free" gold, i.e. of gold in excess of
that required to be held against Federal Reserve notes, amounted
to $2.7 billion at the end of October. Settlement for the U.S.
share of losses by the Pool in the London market through November 24
will reduce this by several hundred million dollars. During the
past week there has been only one small foreign official purchase
of gold from the United States, $8 million by the central bank of
Surinam. It is, of course, possible that some central banks have
been buying gold in the London market.
EEC countries' reserves. During the first ten months of
1967, the Common Market countries' net official reserves and re-
lated assets increased by $1.2 billion. With the addition of net
foreign assets of the commercial banks in these countries, the
aggregate net asset gain produced by surpluses on current account
and nonbank capital account was about $2 billion. Reserve gains
in November through the 24th were around $900 million.
