CURRENT ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL CONDITIONS

I- 1
SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK
Outlook for economic activity
The rebound in economic activity in November will probably
be extended by further gains in industrial production and employment
and a possible decline in the unemployment rate in December. A
continued fast rate of economic growth in the first quarter now seems
certain, despite a leveling off in Federal spending. Investment in
inventories (already up substantially in the fourth quarter) and in
plant and equipment is expected to be considerably higher this quarter,
and consumer spending is also expected to rise somewhat faster. With
demands strong and costs rising, the price advance is likely to con-
tinue at recent high rates, with an upturn in food prices adding to
other pressures.
Judging from fragmentary data, inventory accumulation in
the fourth quarter was higher than we anticipated earlier, and may
increase further this quarter. Durable goods stocks may again be
moving up to high levels; nevertheless, expanding output and sales of
consumer goods and business equipment, as well as rising prices and
strike fears will undoubtedly result in attempts to build stocks
further. Substantial stockpiling of steel is expected in this quarter
as a strike-hedge, and auto dealers' stocks will be rising as output
is maintained at high levels.
Consumer spending is expected to rise in line with income,
which for the quarter as a whole is likely to expand faster than in

I -2
the strike-affected fourth quarter. Rising prices will continue to
account for approximately half of the advance in the volume of consumer
spending. The Federal pay raise will affect incomes for the whole
quarter, an increase in the minimum wage in February will be followed
in March by a rise in social security benefits, and employment and
wages will be expanding with economic activity. However, the cautious
attitude of consumers revealed by recent surveys of consumer sentiments
and buying intentions supports a conservative estimate that the rate
of saving will not drop below 7 per cent this quarter.
The first large advance in plant and equipment outlays in
over a year is expected to take place this quarter, according to the
November Commerce-SEC survey. And housing outlays should also increase
somewhat further this quarter, in view of work already begun and the
upward trend in costs.
Outlook for prices and resource use
Industrial production has recovered much more rapidly than
had been anticipated four weeks ago, with the likelihood now that the
index was 160.5 or more in December--almost 1 per cent above the
previous high of a year earlier. Full recovery in the auto industry
accounted for much of the indicated rise of 4 points or more from
October to December, but there were also widespread gains for other
final products and materials.
The production index is projected to rise further by about
1 point a month from December to March. By December, the rate of

I -3
manufacturing capacity utilization was close to 85 per cent--back to
the rate in the second quarter of 1967--as compared with the October
low of 83 per cent. The production rise now projected through March
would be about in line with the estimated capacity increase, with the
rate of capacity utilization remaining at about 85 per cent.
No let-up is in sight in the rapid rise in wholesale prices
of industrial commodities, which has been at an annual rate of around
3 per cent for 5 months. Moreover, in December, wholesale prices of
farm products apparently increased, following four months of sharp
decline. Further increase in wholesale farm prices from the low
November level, coupled with persistent upward wage and other cost
pressures, would no doubt lead to resumption of advance in consumer
food prices. It still seems likely that the retail price increase for
other commodities will slacken from the very rapid pace of last autumn,
but with food prices rising at a moderate pace (1 to 2 per cent annual
rate) and service costs moving up inexorably (at a 4 per cent rate or
more), the prospect is for continuing increases in the CPI at a 3 to
3-1/2 per cent rate.
The collective bargaining schedule is quite light in
early 1968, and the big push on wages--aside from the recent auto
settlement--will come from the substantial increase in the minimum
wage on February 1, which will affect largely workers in retail trade
and services. In manufacturing, it will put some additional pressure
on wages in lower paying industries. Reflecting widespread increases
in wages, hours, and employment, the rise in average hourly compensation

I-4
in manufacturing is expected to accelerate again. Unit labor costs
in manufacturing have risen at an annual rate of about 3.5 per cent
since midyear, as compared with almost 6 per cent from mid-1966 to
mid-1967. The rise may moderate further in early 1968 as a higher
rate of productivity increase accompanies the growth in output. The
projected rise in output this quarter is expected to increase demands
for labor and to reduce the unemployment rate somewhat.
Outlook for banking
Renewed U.S. Government credit demands in January will
contribute to resumption of bank credit expansion following the
December pause. The $2.5 billion Treasury tax bill financing will be
accompanied by a rise in U.S. Government deposits. But without the
effects of the financing, bank credit expansion would likely be rela-
tively small since private demand deposits are expected to show little
strength, and other sources of funds to banks to rise less than in
recent months.
Banks' ability to obtain funds in the form of time and
savings deposits in this country or through the Euro-dollar market
abroad is expected to continue relatively limited in the weeks ahead.
Recent short-term interest rate increases have further constrained
banks' competitiveness in issuing large negotiable CD's, and have
reduced the rate advantage of CD's to the extent that prospects for
further net growth are quite uncertain. Growth in other time deposits
and savings accounts is likely to continue at or below the recent

I-5
reduced pace, since market interest rates are, at a minimum, not
expected to decline and consumer spending is expected to be relatively
strong.
With deposit growth constrained, anticipated relatively
strong private loan demand would induce banks to undertake further
portfolio adjustments. Business loans are likely to grow at a slower
pace than in December, when a number of special circumstances tempo-
rarily enlarged demands, but inventory expansion and reduced capital
market financing are factors likely to keep such loan growth above
the very moderate August-November 1967 pace. In adjusting to such
loan growth, as well as continued expansion in mortgage and consumer
loans, banks are likely to reduce the rate at which they acquire
municipal securities, will likely be quick to sell off bills acquired
in the tax bill financing, and may have to make further reductions in
the liquid assets that had been restocked last year.
Outlook for capital markets
In bond markets the seasonal lull in new financings is about
to end. Publicly offered corporate bonds already listed for January,
mainly utility issues, total about $800 million (less than the $1.2
billion average monthly volume in 1967) but this figure may increase
somewhat before the month ends. The monthly volume of new municipal
bond issues is expected to grow to exceed $1 billion, and the U.S.
Government will be announcing a PC offering soon. Such credit demands
add up to a fairly large total, but they also represent a moderation

I- 6
from the exceptionally heavy demands of last year. And the chances
of an unexpected large build-up in the calendar may also be less this
year, when, in contrast to last year, industrial corporations appear
to be less inclined to undertake long-term debt financing.
The marketing of these various issues is likely to be
facilitated by the improved bond market psychology of recent weeks.
However, the recent tightening of monetary policy, in conjunction with
anticipated business and consumer loan demands on banks, is likely to
reduce banks' ability to add to their investment portfolio, as noted
above. Also, a somewhat larger than usual share of the institutional
flows that normally become available for investment in January has been
pre-empted by delayed delivery commitments on bonds offered in 1967.
Such supply conditions may be sufficient to keep interest rates from
declining as the January offerings build up in the market, and may lead
to some further updrift in yields.
Rates and other terms on home mortgages can be expected to
tighten further. With spreads between yields on bonds and mortgages
presently reduced to unprecedently narrow margins, funds from some
lending institutions are being diverted increasingly to alternative
forms of long-term investment, a factor that has moderated pressure
on corporate bond markets. At the same time, the accumulating evidence
of reduced savings growth at thrift institutions suggests that the
availability of home financing through these specialized lenders is
also becoming more limited. November data showing increases in gross
withdrawals at S&L's and in passbook loans at saving banks, and

I- 7
fragmentary data for December suggest that a tendency toward reduced
net inflows is continuing. However, none of the data available thus
far or market reports suggest that thrift institutions are facing
drains in January of very major proportions.
Balance of payments
One of the factors which precipitated the program of actions
the President announced on January 1 was a marked deterioration in the
U.S. payments position in the fourth quarter. This stemmed in part
from shrinkage of the export surplus in October and November. The
November rise in imports, in particular, was unexpectedly large.
Earlier it had been thought that, with demand rising both here and
abroad, the trade surplus in 1968 might be about as large as in 1967.
The recent statistics, however, raise the question whether the pro-
jections may have understated the U.S. propensity to import and over-
stated U.S. ability to keep exports rising.
The President's message, which dealt in large part with
capital movements, mentioned also a wide variety of measures to promote
U.S. exports. Of the $3 billion total improvement sought in the
balance of payments for 1968, a half billion was assigned to the trade
surplus. However, those elements of the program that can be implemented
promptly by administrative action do not deal with the underlying com-
petitive position of the United States in world trade.
A second question relating to 1968 prospects concerns
interest rate and credit market prospects in Germany and the rest of

I- 8
Continental Europe. A foreseeable consequence of the new controls on
direct investment outflows and the more stringent VFCR will be a rise
in demands for credit and capital in the Euro-dollar and Euro-bond
markets, with repercussions on European national markets. If Continental
monetary policies failed to make allowance for the added demands, and
if financial markets were permitted to tighten prematurely, the exces-
sive damping of cyclical expansion would react unfavorably on U.S.
exports. The European capital market has exhibited great adaptive
ability in recent years, and especially so in 1967 when German monetary
policy was easy. It is to be hoped that continuation of relatively
easy money policies on the continent this year will facilitate absorp-
tion of additional demands caused by the U.S. program and maintain the
momentum of European economic expansion.

THE ECONOMIC PICTURE IN DETAIL
The Nonfinancial Scene
Gross national product. The November rise in new orders
for durable goods, increased tightness in the labor market, and the
yearend advances in industrial output and in income all attest to
underlying strength in the economy. We continue to anticipate an
accelerated rate of growth in the first quarter of this year. GNP is
projected to rise at the rate of about $20 billion, about the same as
shown in the previous Greenbook; real growth is expected to attain an
annual rate of close to 6.5 per cent, compared to about 5.5 per cent
in the fourth quarter of 1967. The rate of increase in the over-all
GNP deflator is expected to decline slightly from 3.7 per cent rate
to 3.5 per cent. However, the Federal pay raise had accounted for .7
percentage point of the rise in the deflator in the fourth quarter.
Thus, for the private economy alone the deflator would be moving up
faster this quarter--at an annual rate of 3.5 per cent rather than the
3.0 per cent in the fourth quarter.
Although growth in activity projected for the fourth and
first quarters is about the same as shown last month, we now expect a
somewhat different composition of GNP in both quarters. Our current
estimates indicate a more rapid build-up of inventories and somewhat
larger gains in consumer outlays in both quarters than were projected
earlier. On the other hand, Federal purchases and net exports are now
indicated to be at lower levels.

II -2
The step-up in the rate of inventory accumulation in the
fourth quarter reflects in part the relatively large increase shown
in October and November in the book value of manufacturing inventories.
Moreover, the avoidance of work stoppages in the auto industry in
December also contributed to an inventory increase. Nevertheless, the
rise in auto stocks so far has been relatively small, and the ratio of
inventories to unit sales at yearend was lower than in late 1966. The
earlier strikes and the unions' "no overtime" policy at General Motors
were important factors limiting output and preventing dealer stocks
from reaching more normal levels.
Auto production is scheduled at a 9 million annual rate,
seasonally adjusted, in the first quarter, which implies a substantial
increase of auto stocks even though sales are expected to increase
substantially. While it still seems likely that there will be some
scattered short strikes at G.M. plants in January, these should not
significantly affect inventory building for the quarter as a whole.
No signs have appeared of any possible early settlement of the steel
dispute, and hedge buying of steel should add significantly to the
rate of inventory building in this quarter. These special situations,
sharply rising industrial activity, and manufacturers' expectations
that sales will be much higher in 1968 than in 1967 suggest heightened
accumulation of both material and work-in-process inventories this
quarter. The upward trend in industrial prices is a further influence
contributing to more rapid inventory accumulation.

II -3
Consumer expenditures are projected to accelerate somewhat
this quarter. An upsurge in appliance and furniture sales has caused
us to raise our estimates of durable goods spending in the fourth
quarter, and this trend has been projected to continue into early 1968.
Unit sales of new domestic autos are projected at a rate of 8.5 million
in the first quarter. Although sales in November and December were
considerably below this rate (and also below a year ago), they were
apparently hampered by shortages of stocks at both General Motors and
Ford, with the result that there should be some carry-over of demand
into the first quarter. The dollar volume of auto sales also will be
increased by the fact that prices have been raised and that the higher-
priced 1968 models will constitute a much larger proportion of all
cars sold than in the fourth quarter when 1967 models were still widely
available.
The primary reason we have projected a relatively sharp
rise in consumer outlays this quarter is the large rise anticipated
in personal income. The increase this quarter promises to be about
$14.5 billion or 9 per cent at an annual rate. Thus, in the absence
of a tax surcharge, after-tax income should show a very sharp rise.
On the other hand, consumers' attitudes toward their own economic
prospects have remained cautious and recent anticipatory surveys do
not suggest increased buying of major durables. These attitudes seem
to reflect fear that prices will rise faster than income, the possi-
bility of a tax increase, and concern over international developments.
Although it is possible to exaggerate the significance of consumer

II -4
surveys, it would be premature to forecast a reduction in the high
propensity to save displayed in recent quarters. The increase in
sales of consumer durables shown in the projection is accordingly
consistent with the continuance of a 7 per cent saving rate.
Outlays for residential construction have been revised up
slightly for both the fourth and first quarters, based on the strong
October-November housing starts figures. Nonetheless, we anticipate
a moderate decline in starts in the first quarter from 1.5 million
rate attained last quarter because of the likelihood of a decline in
commitments for residential mortgages. Business investment in new
plant and equipment has been projected to show a sharp rise on the
basis of investment plans shown by the November Commerce-SEC survey.
About half of $3 billion rate of increase in the first quarter reflects
a rise in outlays by utilities; durable goods manufacturing accounts
for about a third of the rise.
Our estimates of both Federal defense and nondefense expen-
ditures have been revised downward. We are now assuming that defense
expenditures will hold at about $74.5 billion from the fourth quarter
to mid-1968--the $1.2 billion rise shown for the fourth quarter was
entirely accounted for by higher pay schedules. Estimated defense
purchases are about in line with recent Administration statements that
these purchases would not exceed the midyear Budget total of $74.2
billion for fiscal 1968. The rise projected for nondefense outlays in
this quarter reflects some deferral of CCC purchases.

II -5
A leveling off in cash outlays for defense needs could
occur as a result of delays in payments to producers, rather than
delays in deliveries of products. Alternatively, the leveling off in
spending could be effected by reductions in military inventories.
Whether defense outlays will actually be constrained to the totals
already announced, and if so, what the repercussions would be on pro-
duction and financing needs, cannot be known until the new Budget is
presented to Congress, probably at the end of this month.
The estimated Federal deficit, NIA basis, is reduced to
about $11 billion in the fourth quarter and to $6 billion in the
current quarter. These levels are well below the peak of $14.7 billion
in the second quarter of 1967, mainly because of substantial growth in
receipts--resulting from the sharp income gains--at a time when increases
in expenditures are moderating.

Industrial production. Industrial production in December
is tentatively indicated to have increased at least 1.5 points from
the preliminary November figure of 159.0. At 160.5 or so, the total
index will have exceeded the previous peak of 159.5 a year earlier.
At this stage, our estimate of the December rise can be based only on
the recovery in auto and truck production and a further increase in
steel production. Gains in output of other final products and materials
would, of course, raise the industrial production index even higher.
With Ford back in full production, auto assemblies rose to
an annual rate of about 8.8 million units in December from 7.4 million
in November. This, along with the increase in trucks and auto and
truck parts amounted to over one full point in the total index. Pro-
duction schedules for January are presently set at an annual rate of
8.9 million units, little changed from December. While sales of new
domestic autos in December have partially recovered from their strike
reduced low, they were still below last year's rate of 8.0 million
units.
Output of the other cyclically-sensitive consumer goods--
home goods and apparel--has increased from the mid-1967 low and in
November was only 2 per cent below the 1966 highs. The only available
current and reliable output data for these industries are for home
radio and TV sets; in the first three weeks of December, their produc-
tion was maintained at the advanced November level.
The rise in output of business equipment in November was
associated mainly with strike settlements in the machinery and

II -9
transportation industries. In November, new and unfilled orders for
machinery and equipment were close to record levels, and, if maintained,
could lead to increases in output of these goods. Output of defense
equipment, which had increased rapidly in the first three quarters of
1967, changed little in October and November. While expansion in
defense spending is reportedly leveling off and the rate of increase
of unfilled defense orders slowed in the last half of the year, it is
not yet possible to judge production developments for these goods for
the months immediately ahead.
Output of steel increased further in December and was about
15 per cent above its 1967 low and only 3 per cent below the 1966 peak.
With steel inventories at record levels at producing mills, and at
their lowest levels since 1962 at consuming industries (end of November),
further increases in steel production would clearly indicate another
round of inventory accumulation by consuming industries.
Capacity utilization. Utilization of capacity by manufacturers
is likely to have increased by about one-half point in December, if the
manufacturing production index increases by 1.5 points or more as
expected. The operating rate was estimated to be 84.2 per cent in
November, up sharply from 83.1 per cent the previous month. About one-
third of this increase can be attributed directly to rising motor
vehicle production following settlement of the strike at Ford.
Despite widespread production increases, substantial margins
of unused capacity still exist in most industries. Producers of air-
craft, electric power generating equipment, and petroleum products,

II -10
however, are operating at near capacity levels and only moderate amounts
of unused capacity remain in the rubber and textile industries.

Auto sales and stocks. Unit sales of new domestic autos in
December are tentatively estimated at an annual rate in the 7.6 to 7.8
million range, up from 7.1 million in November. In 1966, sales were
at an annual rate of 8.4 and 8.0 million units in November and December,
respectively. It may be noted that sales of new cars other than Ford
had been weakening for the three consecutive ten-day periods ending
December 20. (Complete data for the last ten-day period of December
are not yet available.) Despite the rather modest recent performance,
optimism among auto producers remains high and industry estimates of
new car sales (including imports) for the 1968 model year have remained
at about 9.0 to 9.3 million units. These estimates may be on the high
side in view of recent sales experience, but given the disrupting
developments of late 1967 it is more difficult than usual to reach
firm judgments.

Rebuilding of new car inventories has continued with stocks
climbing 7 per cent in the second period of December. Inventories
still are one-fifth below a year earlier when stocks were high. If
production schedules are maintained, and sales do not accelerate
sharply, new car stocks some time in January will pass the level of a
year earlier.
Sales of used cars in the middle period of December were
slightly below a year earlier, and for the first two periods were
5 per cent below. Stocks on December 20 were 6 per cent below a year
earlier.
Consumer credit. Consumers added more to their instalment
debt in November than in any other month in 1967. The net increase
in outstandings on a seasonally adjusted basis amounted to $418
million, or $5 billion at annual rates. The largest advances were in
other consumer goods paper and personal loans. In general, new bor-
rowing was up in November while the rate of repayments was off a little

II -12
from its earlier high. Despite November's faster pace, the rise in
consumer credit for the year as a whole is not likely to exceed $3.5
billion, sharply less than the $6.1 billion increase in 1966 and the
smallest rise of any year since the recession low in 1961.
A major factor in the 1967 slowdown was the relatively fast
rate at which consumers repaid their instalment debt. (Indeed, there
was some evidence of pre-payment of debt.) Repayments were especially
large in the second and third quarters, rising just about as much as
new credit extensions during that period.
Much of the slowdown was centered in auto credit. Similarly
it is this area that will largely determine the pace of expansion in
the months ahead. Tending to increase use of credit is the fact that
the average size of the new car note will be considerably higher in
1968 than in 1967, primarily because of higher base prices on the new
models and the tendency of consumers to buy more and more optional
equipment. On the other hand, there does not seem much prospect for
a lengthening in average contract maturity or any significant increase
in the proportion of new cars bought on credit beyond the 68 per cent
of 1967.
Personal loans are likely to expand further in line with
increased spending on education and rising costs of medical and other
services. One questionmark will be the impact of the proposed restric-
tions on travel abroad by United States citizens. Demand for credit
in the nonauto goods area rose steadily throughout 1967, and this is
likely to continue this year. Indeed, demand for such credit could

II -13
pick up markedly should sales of home furnishings show significant
improvement. Repair and modernization loans have been in the doldrums
for the past couple of years. Some lenders feel that consumers have
been making personal cash loans for minor home repairs and improvements,
instead of negotiating them under an FHA or some other special con-
tractual arrangement.
A significant development has been the increased activity
in bank credit cards. Volume outstanding under bank credit card and
check-credit plans rose from $800 million in April 1967 to a little
over $1 billion in October, and all indications point to sharply
increased activity in this area, in oil company credit cards, and in
credit cards generally in the period ahead.
Retail sales. The weekly figures for the three weeks of
December from the 3rd through the 23rd suggest that on a seasonally
adjusted basis retail sales rose further last month--perhaps as much
as the 1-1/2 per cent increase in November. Sales at nondurable goods
stores apparently were little changed or perhaps down slightly from
the preceding month, with sales at apparel stores down substantially
and at restaurants and grocery stores up moderately. However, durable
goods sales appear to have increased sharply, reflecting a very strong
rise at furniture and appliance stores and a moderate advance at auto
dealers.

II -14
Consumer sentiment. Both the Census October Survey of
Consumer Buying Expectations and the November survey conducted by the
University of Michigan show that consumers were less optimistic in
that strike-affected quarter. The University of Michigan's Index of
Consumer Sentiment declined from the August level of 96.5 to 92.9.
This drop was primarily attributable to the consumers' feeling that
they would become financially worse off within the next twelve months.
The dominating influence was the fear of inflation, with approximately
80 per cent of the units surveys stating that they expected their real
purchasing power to decline.
Both surveys reveal that consumer intentions to purchase
new cars are not bouyant. The Michigan survey showed that the expressed
intentions to purchase new cars in the subsequent twelve months had
fallen from the levels of the two previous surveys. Similarly, the
Census survey showed that expected expenditures on new cars in the
months following the October survey had declined somewhat from the
July figures. Both surveys showed increases in intended expenditures
on used cars but showed conflicting findings with respect to purchases
of other household durables.
Residential construction and real estate. Seasonally
adjusted housing starts, which had moved above our earlier projections
in other recent months, continued upward in November. The annual rate
of 1.56 million units for the month--which, incidentally, is signif-
icantly above even the most optimistic projections for the year 1968--

II -15
reflected mainly a dramatic spurt in just one region--the South.
There starts showed a much less than seasonal decline and reached the
highest seasonally adjusted rate for that region in more than three
years. Seasonally adjusted rates in all the other regions--most of
which had shown similarly isolated spurts recently--declined in
November. Both single- and multi-family starts increased, but the
increase continued greatest for multi-family units, which achieved a
four-year high.
Unlike starts, seasonally adjusted building permits were
down in November, though almost entirely for single family units. As
in the case of starts, only the South showed an increase among the
individual regions.
Even if starts turn downward in December from the advanced
November rate, as seems likely, the average for the fourth quarter as
a whole will exceed a 1.5 million unit rate. This would bring the
annual total for 1967 to just above 1.3 million, as compared with the
sharply reduced 1.16 million in 1966 and 1.47 million in 1965.

A factor in the advanced rate of starts this autumn has
apparently been acceleration of plans by some builders in response to
increasing uncertainties about future mortgage market conditions. The
further reduction in vacancy rates during the first half of the year,
although anticipated, also has been a stimulative factor. While
vacancy rates for both rental and home-owner properties are reported
to have risen in the third quarter, the rise was extremely slight and
well within the margin of sampling error; as shown in the table for
the sensitive rental vacancy rate series, the averages have generally
remained well below those in the same period of other recent years.
Also, rent increases have apparently accelerated somewhat in recent
months. And for single-family units, stocks of new homes in all
stages of construction held by speculative builders have apparently
continued near the sharply reduced level reached last summer.

Orders. New orders received by manufacturers of durable
goods rose 2 per cent in November. Gains were widespread, with only
aircraft and electrical machinery registering decreases. New orders
rose 19 per cent in the auto industry following settlement of the
recent strike, although the November level was still well below the
pre-strike level of August, and further recovery was to be expected
in December. If both autos and aircraft are excluded from the total,
orders increased 4 per cent--the first significant rise in several
months. New orders rose for primary metals, fabricated metals, non-
electrical machinery, and other durable goods. The special machinery
and equipment grouping increased 3 per cent, back close to the high
for the year reached in August.

Between June and October new orders for durables had
declined 4 per cent, with the decline entirely due to the drop in the

II -18
auto industry. Shipments, meanwhile, were rising and growth in the
order backlog had slowed. A large part of the increased order backlog
was in the aircraft industry where there are long lags between orders
and production. Increased orders in November, however, were concen-
trated in industries where the impact on production should occur more
quickly.
Unfilled orders edged up 0.2 per cent in November, continu-
ing the rise which began last May. Backlogs are now about 2 per cent
above their record highs of last year. Unfilled orders represent about
3.3 month shipments at present, about the same as in May and also in
November 1966.
Business inventories. The book value of business inventories
(including revised figures for manufacturers) in October increased at a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of $4.4 billion, moderately above the
third quarter rate of $3.9 billion. The bulk of the October accumula-
tion--and the moderate increase over the third quarter rate--was
accounted for by durable manufacturing industries (notably defense,
consumer durables, and construction materials); factory stocks of non-
durable goods declined slightly in October and distributors' stocks
showed only a slight increase.
In November, manufacturers' stocks (preliminary) jumped
sharply--accumulation totaled $600 million (or an annual rate of $7.2
billion), the largest since last April. In November again accumulation
was concentrated in durable goods industries, with particularly large

II -19
spurts in defense and business equipment (apparently largely work-in-
process). The book value of nondurable goods inventories continued
to show little change.
A sharp (nearly 5 per cent) upturn in manufacturers'
shipments accompanied the spurt (of 0.7 per cent) in inventories in
November, and the stock-sales ratio declined to 1.75, the lowest of
the year. This was only moderately above late 1966 but still well
above the relatively low 1964-65 average. The rise in shipments--and
the decline in the stock-sales ratio--was pronounced for both durable
and nondurable goods. For durable goods, however, the rise in ship-
ments--and the decline in stock-sales ratio--merely represented a
return to about the pre-strike levels of August, and the November
stock-sales ratio of 2.26 was still unusually high (comparing with
2.11 in December 1966 and 1.91 in 1964-65). For nondurable goods,
however, the sharp rise in shipments (breaking out of the pattern of
relative stability from May through October) and stability in inven-
tories brought the stock-sales ratio down abruptly to a new postwar
low of 1.23.
Labor market. The vigorous expansion in employment and
improvement in unemployment that was apparent in the November data
appears to have been sustained in subsequent weeks. While total
employment and unemployment figures are not yet available for December,
unemployment insurance claims through late December suggest a further
decline in unemployment last month.

II -20
The ebb and flow in demand for labor in 1967 can be seen
clearly in changes in the rate of insured unemployment. Labor demand
in the industrial sectors of the economy--which were most affected by
the dip in output early in 1967--tends to be sensitively reflected in
the unemployment insurance claims, since an overwhelming proportion of
the workers in these sectors are covered and apply for unemployment
benefits when laid off. The total unemployment rate this year also
was strongly affected by changes in supply of new workers and re-
entrants to the labor market of women.
The insured unemployment rate shows a distinctly different
unemployment pattern for the year than total unemployment, which
increased until late in the year and reached its peak rate of 4.3 per
cent in October, when the labor market was showing other signs of
improvement. In contrast, the rate of insured unemployment rose sharply
in the spring coincident with the decline in manufacturing employment,
reached its 1967 peak in July, at 2.8 per cent, and declined steadily
after that. The rate in November was 2.3 per cent, about the same as
a year earlier; incomplete figures for the month suggest that the rate
may show some further decline in December.

The employment figures for November appear to suggest that
a significant improvement in the labor market had been in the making,
although obscured somewhat by the direct and indirect effects of the
Ford and other strikes. Nonfarm employment advanced significantly
more in the industrial sector than could be explained by the ending
of the strike, and growth momentum was also stepped up in the non-
industrial sectors, particularly trade and services.
Nonfarm payroll employment in November increased by 480,000,
or almost 300,000 more than could be explained by strike returns, and
was half a million above the prestrike (August) level. In manufactur-
ing, employment rose by a quarter million in November. The recovery
in employment in manufacturing was strongest in the nondurable goods
sector, which reached a new high following 3 months of solid gains.
In durable goods, the metal-using industries showed the largest gains,
but smaller increases were widespread in other industries. Actually,
the gain in transportation equipment was smaller than expected in view
of the end of the auto strike. Protracted negotiations on local issues
and brief stoppages at General Motors were in part responsible for the
relatively poor showing. Further employment gains should be evident
in December. The workweek in manufacturing averaged 40.9 hours, up
two-tenths of an hour from the prestrike August level, but still four-
tenths shorter than a year earlier.
Nonmanufacturing industries showed growing demand for man-
power on a broad front. Growth was particularly strong in State and
local government, services and trade; construction employment advanced

II -22
somewhat, and has shown considerable firmness in recent months. The
workweek has also lengthened appreciably. In fact, the only sector
to show employment weakness was Federal Government,now down 50,000
from its midyear peak.
With continued growth in the nonindustrail activities, a
firmer pattern for construction, and manufacturing employment growth
sustained by further recovery in autos and high rates of production
in steel and machinery, continued strong growth in nonfarm employment
seems in prospect, in the first quarter, with a concomitant tightening
of the labor market.
Productivity and unit labor costs. Both output and manhours
rose sharply in manufacturing in November, following the end of the
Ford strike. But the increase in output was greater than the rise in
manhours, resulting in some rebound in productivity. Recovery of
production from the auto strikes was still not complete in November,
however, and the gain in productivity from a year earlier continued at
less than one per cent, about the same slow pace maintained in the
first three quarters.
Average hourly compensation in manufacturing also rose in
November as the return of high-wage workers increased the average
workweek and average hourly earnings, but the full impact on hourly
compensation of the auto settlement with its large first-year increase
is yet to be felt. Ratification by UAW and General Motors of the new
contract did not come until the end of December. In addition, because

II -23
of the continuation of some strike activity in November at auto plants
and related industries, production schedules were disrupted and hours
of work at premium pay in durable goods manufacturing still remained
below the September level.
As a result, the November increase in average hourly com-
pensation in manufacturing from a year earlier--5.7 per cent--was some-
what less than the 6.5 per cent average increase in the first three
quarters of the year. However, with the recovery from the Ford strike
completed in December, and the settlement at G,M. adding upward
pressures on wage rates in January, compensation per manhour should
begin to accelerate again. A substantial increase in industrial pro-
duction--expected to run 9 per cent (annual rate) from the fourth to
first quarters--should be associated with a temporary rise in produc-
tivity sharp enough to offset much of the impact of rising compensation
on unit labor costs. However, increases in production (and productivity)
of these magnitudes are unlikely to be sustained for long, and since
earnings should continue up sharply throughout most of 1968, unit labor
costs are likely to increase more rapidly again.

II -24
Wholesale prices. The BLS industrial price average increased
another 0.3 per cent in November and, according to preliminary estimates,
rose 0.2 per cent further in December. In view of the facts that in
both October and November the preliminary estimates (of 0.2 per cent
increases) understated the actual increases, and that the December
estimate was closed out earlier than usual to permit a pre-Christmas
release, the December estimate may be subject to upward revision also.
At 107.3 per cent of the 1957-59 average, the present December estimate
is 1.2 per cent above mid-July (for the 5-month period this represents
a 3 per cent annual rate of increase). Since December 13, the BLS
pricing date, increases have been effected for a variety of industrial
materials and products including ferro alloys and other steel will
products, several chemicals, fuel oil, some electrical equipment,
and autos (to cover the new safety belts).
In both November and December, the major increases were in
metals, machinery and textiles. In November these three groups accounted
for roughly three-fourths of the rise in the industrial average. Prices
of finished motor vehicles, which had contributed so much to the October
increase, were unchanged although parts producers raised their prices
1.3 per cent. Industrial chemicals, which had increased significantly
in October, also showed no change in November. Prices of lumber and
plywood continued to decline, but much less than in October and less
than expected seasonally.
Copper powder and scrap and copper and brass mill products
have moved up sharply further, under the influence of the still-unsettled,

II- 25
5-month strike. Steel scrap turned up in November as steel output
increased, and prices of steel mill products rose further. Sizable
increases in prices of cold rolled sheets and galvanized sheet and
strip effective December 15 (noted in the last Greenbook) became
industry-wide (while increases announced for hot-rolled sheets by a
few small producers were rescinded when the major steel producers
did not follow suit). More recently some steel producers have
raised the prices of mill products used mainly by railroads. These
increases will first appear in the January price index.
The machinery and equipment group in November showed the
largest increase in 10 months. Substantial price increases were
registered for metal working machinery after several months of little
change, and prices continued to rise for agricultural, construction,
and various other types of special-industry machinery.
The rise in prices of textile products in recent months
has stemmed in the main from sharp increases in the price of raw
cotton, under the influence of very short supplies particularly
of long staple cotton, but also from a moderate upward movement in
prices of man-made fibers.
The table below shows changes in the Federal Reserve special
groupings of the BLS wholesale price indexes from July to November,
as compared with changes over the preceding year. Salient features
of the showing are: (1) the sharp upturn in average prices of
sensitive industrial materials since July (this reflected primarily
increases ranging from 10 to 30 per cent for the copper items included,

II -26
and a 10 per cent increase in raw cotton together with sizable increases
in cotton yarn and cotton and mixed cotton and man-made fiber fabrics);
(2) the pronounced acceleration in the rise in prices of both consumer
and producer industrial products and the unusually large contribution
to the rise made by the sharp boost in prices of motor vehicles
(primarily in October when 1968 models were first priced); and (3)
the large further decline in prices of foods and food stuffs from
July to November--which resulted in a moderate decline in the total
wholesale index over the period.

In December, the BLS has estimated a sharp (2.4 per cent)
rise in prices of farm products and an 0.5 per cent increase for
processed foods and feeds. As a result of this turn-around in farm
prices, the total wholesale price index rose 0.5 per cent, to 106.7
per cent of the 1957-59 average--slightly above the previous 1967
high of 106.5 in July. According to the BLS, increases occurred for
grains, livestock, meats, eggs, and cotton. (Cotton, it should be
noted, is classified as a sensitive industrial material--and thus
as part of the industrial commodity total--in the special Federal
Reserve groupings, used in the table above.) Apparently, however,
the agricultural price rise caught by the BLS in December was
exaggerated because of the pricing date--as the Assistant Commissioner
commented at the press conference, the rise was "something of a
statistical fluke." Corn prices in particular were temporarily
high on that date, and December 13 was apparently unrepresentative
for some other products. The Department of Agriculture's index
of prices received by farmers increased only 1 per cent during the
month ended December 15, as compared with the BLS finding of a
2.4 per cent increase for farm products. Nevertheless, rising prices
of foods and foodstuffs--whatever the magnitude--contrast with
developments from mid-year through November when these prices
declined sharply.
Consumer prices. The consumer price index increased 0.3
per cent in November, the same as in October. At 117.8 per cent of
the 1957-59 average, the November CPI was 2.8 per cent above a year

II- 28
earlier, with the bulk of the increase occurring since last April.
The index increased at a 4.2 per cent annual rate from April to
August when food prices rose sharply; since August, with food prices
down somewhat, the index has increased at a 3.2 per cent rate.
Food prices declined slightly further in November, but
the decline was less than seasonal. Prices of non-food commodities
continued to rise at a rapid rate, owing mainly to another large
increase in apparel prices, further gains in house furnishings, and
a spurt in gasoline prices (principally because of the end of
"price wars" in the Los Angeles area) despite a further decrease
at wholesale. New car prices rose somewhat further--but less than
seasonally--and used car prices edged off a bit.
Prices of consumer services increased 0.4 per cent in
November--about the rate of other recent months. In addition to
the continuing rapid increase in medical care, prices of public
transportation and recreational services showed particularly large
gains. Rents, mortgage interest rates, and property taxes were also
higher.
Farmoutput. Total output of farm products in 1967 reached
a record 17 per cent above the 1957-59 average and 3 per cent above
that of 1966. By commodity, output performance was spotty, as
shown in the table below, with output ranging from record highs
for meat animals, poultry, feed grains, food grains, oil crops, and
vegetables, down to relatively low levels for dairy products and fruits
and nuts. Cotton output was the smallest since 1896.

1/ Preliminary
The varied pattern of 1967 farm output has important implica-
tions for consumers in 1963 through the volume of supplies of food
and fibers that will be available to them and the prices that the
commodities may command. For producers, the impact will be on their
production plans for 1968. National production goals for 1968 call
for cuts in acreages of feed grains and wheat and increases in acreages
of cotton and rice.
Record output of meat animals and poultry in 1967 permitted
per capita consumption of 222 pounds, 4 per cent more than the reduced
rate of 1966, and the largest of record. An equally high rate of meat
consumption is indicated for 1968 on the basis of plans currently

II -30
reported by producers. However, the biggest feed grain crops of
record coupled with prospects for continued strong consumer demand
may induce livestock producers to expand their plans. So real is
the threat of overexpansion considered to be that Secretary Freeman
called a conference of livestock and poultry producers and representa-
tives of farm organizations in early December to urge restraint
in livestock production plans and to call attention to measures
available for stabilizing grain prices depressed by huge domestic
and foreign output of feed grains. In the meantime the Department
is promoting reductions in feed grain acreage in 1968 by reinstating
attractive features of earlier acreage diversion programs which
had been omitted in 1967.
The dairy enigma continues: price supports have been
raised by successive steps a total of 27 per cent since 1965 but
production continues to decline. Consumption is declining too,
partly reflecting consumer resistance to higher prices. Short
production of deciduous and citrus fruits and nuts in 1967 is
apparently a one-year phenomenon caused by unfavorable growing
weather in nearly all producing areas. Steps to increase 1968
cotton production have been announced. An attractive cotton
acreage diversion program combined with adverse weather reduced
the acreage for harvest in all areas. Nationally cotton yields
were 67 per cent below 1966 and 87 per cent below the 1961-65 average.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL SITUATION
Bank deposits. The seasonally adjusted cedit proxy declined
slightly in December--the first decline since late 1966. Moreover,
with the increased cost and reduced availability of Euro-dollars,
borrowing from foreign branches remained essentially unchanged on an
average basis.
Growth in seasonally adjusted time and savings deposits slowed
further in the early weeks of December, and then declined in the final
two weeks of the year. In large part, this weak performance reflected
the $772 million attrition of negotiable CD's out of a record $5.9
billion of maturities. Rising market yields continued to reduce the
relative attractiveness of these instruments and by the end of the
month the Regulation Q ceiling rate of 5-1/2 per cent was being offered
throughout the maturity range of CD's. While only incomplete pre-
liminary information is available at this writing, the average maturity
of CD sales apparently dropped further in December. For New York City
banks, the average maturity of CD's sold in December was only 2.1
months, with the average maturity of outstandings for those banks
declining to a record low of 2.4 months.

Not all of the slower growth of time deposits in December
can be explained by CD attrition. The moderation in inflows of other
time and savings deposits at weekly reporting banks, noticeable since
early fall, became more pronounced in recent weeks, reflecting the
pull of rising yields available on market securities. In addition,
expansion in total time deposits at country member banks, most of
which are not issuers of large denomination negotiable CD's, slowed
noticeably in December.
The slowing in growth of time deposits occurred while the
sum of private and Government demand balances was declining on a
daily average basis. Since the early weeks of November, the money
stock has been essentially unchanged, after almost uninterrupted
expansion at about a 7 per cent annual rate in the first 10 months of

III -3
the year. The failure of the money stock to rise in recent weeks--at
a time when Government deposits were declining and the pace of economic
activity apparently was expanding further--suggests that the unusually
rapid rebuilding of money balances has now about run its course. As
a result, the usual effects of higher interest rates on the demand
for money have reasserted themselves, reducing the rate of expansion
in the money stock.
Bank credit. With deposit growth constrained, banks in
December reduced their liquidity to accomodate a sizable business
loan expansion. Preliminary data indicate a large decline in U. S.
Government security holdings over the month--concentrated in Treasury
bills. For the same reason, the rate of accumulation of other
securities--mainly municipals--was sharply reduced.

Total loans increased somewhat faster than in the previous
three months, and business loans are estimated to have expanded at
the fastest rate since July, 1966. To some degree, special factors
tended to accelerate business loan expansion in December. Loans to
commodity dealers, for example, increased very rapidly as dealers,
on behalf of the mills, made large cotton purchases from the CCC
to cover 1968 production in view of the year's short crop. In
addition, the normal year-end "carve-out" loans to the mining industry
were very much larger than usual

But, special factors aside, the strengthening of business
loan demands reflects more basic underlying economic activity. For
example, inventory stockpiling of steel, in anticipation of a strike
later this year, has already begun to increase loan demands of the

primary metals manufacturers--who apparently have been building up
their own stocks. Similarly, the increasing level of dealer inventories
of automobiles has produced some additional bank borrowing. More
generally, the strengthening of business loan demands probably
reflects both the expanded level of working capital needs by business
firms--associated with the apparently increasing pace of economic
activity--and the slower rate of capital market financing.
Among other loan categories, real estate and consumer loans
maintained their somewhat higher rate of growth of recent months. On
the other hand, loans to nonbank financial institutions--especially
finance companies--moderated, probably associated with the increase
in the prime rate in November, which again made direct bank financing
considerably more costly than issuing commercial paper. The reduction
in security loans, despite strength in the "other" category, reflected
the reductions in inventories of U.S. Government security dealers
over the month.
Bank liquidity. Despite the liquidation of securities and
the higher pace of business loan demands in December, the banking
system enters the new year with its liquidity position somewhat
improved from that of a year earlier--although still low by standards
of earlier years.

III -6
It is always extremely difficult to quantity the liquidity
position of banks, but, as one measure, the loans-to-deposit ratio
seems to suggest such an improvement--especially at the larger
banks.

The absolute decline in this ratio from 1966 to 1967 was much larger
at reserve city than at country banks. To a degree this development
is associated with the substantial increase in loans at the larger
banks in 1966 and their limited deposit growth in the second half of
that year. In addition, the larger drop-off in the ratio for reserve
city banks in 1967 is a reflection of the fairly normal pattern of
more pronounced cyclical changes in loans at larger banks relative to

III -7
the smaller ones. This tendency, however, was apparently accentuated
in 1967 by the unusually large substitution of market financing for
bank loans. This alternative source of funds is more available to
larger firms which deal mainly with the larger banks.
When liquidity positions are indicated by the ratio of a bank's
most liquid assets to deposits, however, the large weekly reporting
banks do not show so marked an improvement--as indicated by measure I
in the accompanying table. However, the addition of Treasury
issues due in 1 to 5 years (measure II) improves the liquid asset
ratio of these banks further--although, even this measure of liquidity
at the end of 1967 remains below that of the period prior to 1964.
Finally, the inclusion of acceptances and municipals due within 1 year
would add 2.5 percentage points to the ratio in 1967, a year that is
thought to be one of unusually large bank purchases of shorter-term
municipals, but maturity breakdownsof municipal holdings are not
available prior to mid-1966 so historical comparisons are limited.

On balance, then, the impression remains that banks--especially
the larger ones--have improved their portfolio liquidity in 1967 relative
to 1966. But these liquidity ratios remain below those of 1964 and
perhaps 1965, and do not suggest that banks are in an overly comfortable
position to finance sharp increases in loans from portfolio adjustments
if and as they find it difficult to obtain funds through expansion in
their liabilities.2/

Corporate and municipal bond markets. After reaching their
1967 highs early in December, yields on municipal and new corporate
bonds showed a slight tendency to decline thereafter as new issues
volume slowed seasonally. Both markets appear to have taken the
Board's recent announcements on reserve requirements and the new
balance of payments actions in stride, although a continuing large
prospective volume of new issues and uncertainties about the future
strength of bank investment demands have contributed to a more cautious
tone in the municipal than in the corporate market.

The gross volume of new corporate bonds offered publicly in
December totaled slightly over $1 billion, despite the seasonal slack-
ness of new issues after mid-month. This exceeded the reduced
November volume by more than $400 million and matched the unusually
large volume offered in December 1966. Moreover, with private place-
ments expected to show a seasonal increase substantially larger than
last year, total corporate security offerings for December, including
stock, are estimated at a relatively high $2.2 billion.
For all of 1967 the gross volume of corporate bond and stock
issues amounted to an estimated $24.7 billion, three-fifths more than
the previous $18.1 billion record for 1966. With the volume of
private bond placements and stock slightly smaller than in 1966, the
year-to-year increase in total corporate security offerings was
more than accounted for by publicly offered bonds. Such issues expanded
by nearly $7 billion to about $15 billion. Of this total $13.5
billion and nearly all of the increase was accounted for by industrial
issues. At the same time, the relatively high level of interest
rates and stock prices induced debt issuers to resort increasingly
to convertible bonds. Thus, the volume of convertibles rose to over
$4 billion for the year, more than double the previous record of
$1.9 billion issues in 1966.
Corporate debt financing through public offerings is expected
to remain high in January relative to normal experience, but neverthe-
less to fall below the $1 billion or more per month volume that

III -11
prevailed during most of 1967. The calendar of issues already
scheduled for January totals $790 million, about $50 million more
than was ultimately offered in January 1967. Private placements
for January are estimated at $700 million, $300 million below
December's seasonally high volume, so total bond and stock volume
is expected to amount to about $1.9 billion. The usual turn of the
year investment demand from pension funds and trust accounts is not
expected to be a significant factor this January since a substantial
part of these excess funds were committed in 1967 for delayed
delivery.
The bulk of corporate public bond offerings now scheduled for
January are utility issues with only one significant industrial bond on
the calendar (the $200 million Indiana Standard Oil debenture). Since
the number of new industrial offerings announced has slowed recently,
and corporate underwriters also report a slackening in the number of
large industrial borrowers considering near-term debt financing, the
monthly volume of public bond offerings may show a year to year decline
in coming months. However, a continuing large volume of utility
financing will still insure a substantial volume of new issues from
non-financial corporations.

In the municipal bond market, the volume of new issues in
December aggregated slightly below $1 billion, $300 million less than
earlier estimates. All of this short-fall was accounted for by post-
ponements--including several industrial revenue issues--which developed
following a rise in municipal bond yields early in the month. Despite
the drop in new issues volume, municipal dealers' advertised inventories
advanced to more than $500 million early in the month and have shown
little change since. The January volume of new issues is currently
estimated at $1.2 billion, which is large considering the current
level of inventories and a possible further slowing of bank demand.--

III -13
During all of 1967, municipal security offerings rose to a
record volume of nearly $14.4 billion, $3 billion more than in 1966.
To some extent this growth reflected the continuing general expansion
of capital needs among State and local government units. But volume
was also accentuated on balance by the carry-over of borrowings
postponed during the 1966 credit crunch--although, as has been indicated,
as the year progressed,high interest costs again exerted restraints
on some borrowers. At the same time, high interest rates, along with
the threat of Congressional withdrawal of the tax exemption privilege,
ballooned the volume of industrial reveuue offerings. Altogether,
industrial issues aggregated $1.3 billion, an increase of 160 per
cent from the previous record for such offerings in 1966.

Corporate liquidity, The exceptionally large volume of
corporate funds raised in capital markets during the third quarter,
together with seasonally low income tax payments, were accompanied
by a contraseasonal rise in corporations' holdings of liquid assets
and a much smaller than usual expansion in their short-term debts. As
a result, corporate liquidity--as measured by ratios of liquid assets
to total current liabilities--remained practically unchanged from the
second to the third quarter. In all other recent years, liquidity has
declined by at least a full percentage point in the third quarter and
in 1966 the decline was even larger.
Stability in the ratios in the third quarter this year is thus
equivalent to a seasonally adjusted increase--the first such increase
this year. In the first two quarters, when capital market financing
was somewhat smaller and income tax payments were larger than in the
third quarter, corporate liquidity ratios showed the usual quarter-to-
quarter declines, and such improvement in liquidity positions as
occurred was mainly in the lengthening of the average maturity of
corporate debt. Nevertheless, even with improvement becoming apparent
in liquidity ratios in the third quarter, corporate holdings of liquid
assets remained below their levels of a year earlier and liquidity
ratios remained at historical lows for this quarter.

Mortgage market developments. The continued high level of bond
yields during December kept interest rates in the mortgage market under
upward pressure, with numerous savings banks and life insurance companies
reportedly remaining out of the secondary market as the end of the year
approached. Weekly offerings of Government underwritten home mortgages
to FNMA for purchase under its secondary market operations accordingly
remained fairly strong through December 29 (latest available data),
although they continued below the near-record levels which prevailed
before FNMA cut its buying prices late in November.

III -16
During November, the uptrend in mortgage rates on new homes
accelerated within both primary and secondary markets, according to
the official FHA series shown in the table. Returns on home mortgages,
however, again rose less than average yields on new issues of high-
grade corporate bonds. As a result, gross yield spreads favoring con-
ventional or FHA-insured home mortgages over corporate bonds decreased
sharply further to the narrowest margins in the history of the series
(dating from 1953 for conventional loans and 1948 for FHA loans).
In fact, implied net yield spreads--after allowance for servicing
costs which run a good deal higher on mortgages than on bonds--may
well have been negative on the average.

In view of these unfavorable yield-spread relationships as
well as growing uncertainties about net savings inflows, reporting
private lenders expanded their aggregate mortgage commitments at
a slower pace during October-November, as the table shows. The reduced
rate of commitment growth reflected partly the already-high level of
outstanding commitments--p a rti cularly for savings and loan associations--
and partly the resurgence of FNMA as a significant additional source of
market support. S&L's, as might be expected, generally continued to
increase their outstanding mortgage commitments on properties of all
types more rapidly than the more diversified savings banks and life
insurance companies.

Growing selectivity of private lenders in making loans, higher
mortgage discounts, and increases in interest rates may have dampened
the turnover of some existing dwellings in recent months. Meanwhile,
the rate of new home starts has continued upward, partly because buyers
of such dwellings have greater ultimate recourse to a backlog of older
mortgage commitments made earlier under more favorable terms.
Flows to depositary-type intermediaries. Net savings inflows
showed a divergent experience for savings and loan associations and
mutual savings banks in November. At the S&L's they were not only
below previous Novembers through 1963 but also showed the first year-
to-year decline experienced in 1967. This relative deterioration in
November occurred despite a record volume of gross new savings, due to
a balancing increase in gross withdrawals. In fact, the ratio of
withdrawals to new savings rose to nearly 78 per cent, the highest
November ratio ever registered and the first year-to-year increase
in the ratio experienced for any month in 1967.
The November inflow of regular deposits to mutual savings
banks, on the other hand, showed an increase relative to previous
Novembers, and as shown in the table, inflows at both types of thrift
institutions over the first eleven months of 1967 were also very large
relative to earlier years.

There is evidence, however, that the large net deposit gains
at mutual savings banks in November were paralleled by increases in
passbook loans. At the 15 largest savings banks in New York City, for
example, the large first-half November and December net deposit
gains were accompanied by extraordinarily large increases in passbook
loans, as shown in the table. Past experience would suggest the like-
lihood of correspondingly large withdrawals after the December interest-
crediting period. Data for these savings banks for the first three
days of the reinvestment period at the end of December indicate thatI -e

III -20
the December experience relative to 1966 and 1965 does show an increase
in net loss after adjustment for passbook loans. The 1967 three-day
loss of $64.6 million compares with $45.7 and $58.1 million for 1966
and 1965 respectively, or, as a percentage of deposits, .37 per cent,
.29 per cent, and .38 per cent for 1967, 1966, and 1965.

As a result of the asset management policies conducted
during 1967, both the S&L's and the mutual savings banks appear some-
what better equipped to withstand a shrinkage in savings flows than they
were in 1966. The S&L's ratio of Government securities plus cash
holdings (net of borrowings) to share capital, which decreased from
3,9 to 2.5 per cent for the two semiannual periods in 1966, increased
to 5.3 in the first half of 1967 and further to 6.3 in the second half
through November, a ratio not exceeded since the second half of 1963.
Net advances from the FHLBB, which typically rise late in the year,
increased by approximately $70 million in November and $100 million
in the first three weeks of December, carrying outstanding advances
back to their June, 1967 level; except for the unseasonal decline in
advances in December 1966, the preliminary data for December 1967
indicate an unusually small increase in advances. The cash-to-deposit
ratio of mutual savings banks has recovered from its slight 1966
decrease, although cash-plus-Governments to deposits has been maintained
below its post-1963 levels; mutual savings banks have pursued an aggressive
policy of purchasing a record amount of corporate securities in the
public market, however, and have thereby improved the marketability of
their asset composition.
Stock market developments. During much of December stock
prices fluctuated around a relatively flat trend line, as seasonal tax-
motivated transactions tended to depress the market. Trading activity
was heavy, however, averaging over 11 million shares per day for the

III -22
month. At month-end prices turned up again, on even more active
trading, resuming the general advance that had developed during the
latter half of November. To a considerable extent, this most recent
stimulus to stock prices has apparently come from the covering of
record short positions left open during the period of tax selling.
In addition, however, there are several indications of renewed specula-
tive activity.
Although the Dow-Jones industrial average and Standard and
Poor's composite index of 500 stocks remain respectively 4.0 per cent
and 1.3 per cent below the record highs reached near the end of September,
the American Exchange index has advanced to a level 4.7 per cent above
its previous high. Moreover, the number of stocks on which the American
Exchange placed 100 per cent margin requirements rose from 11 on
November 15 to a record of 30 in the last week of December. The New
York Exchange, which places special margin requirements on convertible bonds
and convertible preferred stocks as well as common stocks, increased the num-
ber of its issues covered by special requirements from 12 on November 5 to an
unprecedented 53 at year end. Of the 53, 39 were common stocks. Few
of the issues subjected to special margin requirements on either exchange
were low-priced, but most were "glamour," or in a few cases gold mining,
stocks. Even so, Standard and Poor's low-price common stock index is
also at an all-time high, 4.9 per cent above the previous high reached
in early October.

III -23
During November, margin customers moderated their borrowing
activity somewhat relative to earlier months. Thus, margin debt rose
only $70 million from a revised level of $6,020 million in October--
the smallest monthly increase since May. Purpose loans at banks
also experienced only a modest increase, rising $19 million to $2,442
million. At the same time, customers net free credit balances were
drawn down $13 million, the first such net withdrawal since August,
and some funds were apparently withdrawn from margin customers'
special miscellaneous balances with brokers as well.
U.S. Government securities market. Yields on intermediate and
long-term Treasury obligations have declined since early December,
while Treasury bill rates have risen on balance as the table shows. In
general, the U.S. Government securities market has been much steadier
in recent weeks, following a period of sharp fluctuations in the wake
of the devaluation of sterling and increases in U.K. and U.S.
discount rates. There was only a minor reaction in bill and bond
markets to the increase in reserve requirements announced in late
December. And the Administration's program to alleviate the U.S.
balance of payments deficit announced January 1 imparted firm tone
to Treasury markets. Market professionals apparently viewed the
steps as diminishing the likelihood of a further near-term tightening
of monetary policy.

The generally firm atmosphere in the Treasury bond market
since the early part of December has reflected a variety of influences,
including the seasonal hiatus in the schedule of new bond issues and
generally light dealer inventories. A sizable volume of year-end tax
swapping activity, featuring maturity lengthening transactions, has
also contributed to the better market tone. There have been indications
of a growing, but by no means universal, feeling that long-term bond
yields could be at or near their peaks, even if short- and intermediate-
term yields should advance further with less money market conditions.
With the development of slightly firmer money market conditions
over the course of December, Treasury bill rates have edged higher on
balance. This small advance in yields occurred despite strong investor
demand during December which was supplemented by sizable net purchases
by foreign official accounts. However, upward pressure on bill rates could
be generated by the imminent Treasury cash financing in the bill

III -25
area in conjunction with less easy money market conditions. Still, the
technical position of the bill market is strong with dealer bill holdings
relatively light.
The Treasury announced on January 3 that it would raise $2.5 billion
of new money through the sale of June tax bills. The auction will be
held on January 9, with payment on the 15th. Banks will be allowed 100
per cent tax and loan credit. An $800 million FNMA PC offering to the
public was announced at the same time. It will include a $500 million
3-year issue and a $300 million 20-year portion, to be offered about
January 16 and paid for on January 30,
Yields on a number of key short-term market instruments
have risen further in recent weeks, as is indicated in the accompanying

Federal budget. Staff projections of the Federal budget
through the first quarter of 1968 indicate a sharp decline in the
Federal deficit on the basis of the seasonally adjusted national
income accounts. This deficit had reached a peak of $15 billion at
annual rates in the second quarter of 1967 and is projected to be
down to a level of $6 billion by the first quarter of 1968. The
decline is due to rising tax receipts and an apparent leveling off in
Federal expenditures.
On a cash basis, the cumulative Federal deficit in the first
three quarters of fiscal year 1968 is projected to amount to $25 billion.
But with a seasonal surplus expected in the last quarter of the fiscal
year, the total cash deficit for the fiscal year might be between $17
and $19 billion.
In the first quarter of calendar year 1968, a cash deficit
of $5 billion is projected, requiring $4 billion of net cash borrowing
during that quarter. About $1.5 billion of PC sales to the public are
also assumed.

New U.S. balance of payments program. On January 1, the
President announced a program "designed to bring our balance of
payments to -- or close to -- equilibrium in the year ahead." He
said that the payments deficit for 1967 (on the published liquidity
basis) would be "in the area of $3.5 to $4 billion -- the highest
since 1960." An improvement of about $3 billion in 1968 would be
sought from the following:
(1) Direct investment -- at least $1 billion;
(2) Lending by financial institutions -- at
least $500 million;
(3) Travel -- $500 million;
(4) Government expenditures overseas --
$500 million; and
(5) Trade -- at least $500 million.
The President reiterated that the most urgent needs are
for a tax increase and for responsible wage-price decisions to

IV -2
"help to stem the inflationary pressures which now threaten our
economic prosperity and our trade surplus." He stated again that
"the dollar will remain convertible into gold at $35 an ounce, and
our full gold stock will back that commitment," but made no recom-
mendation regarding the gold cover requirement for Federal Reserve
notes. He asked that plans to create Special Drawing Rights in the
IMF be speeded up.
The President's target figures for balance-of-payments
improvement should be taken as indicating orders of magnitude.
Some of the new measures have not been fully worked out and cannot
be implemented at once. In any case, many of the figures are not
closely calculable, since the net effect of the new measures will
depend partly on foreign reactions and on other developments here
and abroad.
The most important and fully articulated of the new
measures are those relating to outflows of U.S. private capital.
The Commerce Department program for direct investments is tightened
severely and becomes mandatory, effective immediately. For each
company, net capital flows (including reinvested earnings) in 1968
may not -- except as authorized in exceptional circumstances --
exceed the following percentages of the 1965-66 averages:
(1) To less developed countries -- 110 per cent;

IV -3
(2) To developed countries heavily dependent on
U.S. capital (including Canada, Japan, Australia,
the United Kingdom, and Middle Eastern oil-
producing countries) -- 65 per cent;
(3) To all other countries (developed countries in
continental Western Europe and South Africa) --
investment only out of earnings, and only up to
35 per cent of the 1965-66 base.
Businesses are also required to repatriate foreign earnings at least
in the proportions of 1964-66, and legislation to induce or encourage
the repatriation of earnings may be proposed. Also, liquid funds
abroad above the 1965-66 monthly average are to be returned by mid-
1968. As earlier noted, the new program for direct investments is
intended to cut net outflows -- mainly to continental Western Europe --
by at least $1 billion from 1967 to 1968.
The Federal Reserve programs for banks and other financial
institutions remain technically voluntary, but may be made mandatory
if necessary. The guidelines have been tightened in a way designed
to induce a reflow of funds from abroad during 1968 of at least $500
million -- $400 million of bank credit and $100 million of covered
assets of other financial institutions. This will represent an
improvement, by comparison with 1967 outflows covered by the pro-
grams, of roughly $900 million, considerably more than the "at
least $500 million" mentioned by the President.
For banks, the general ceiling on outstanding credits
to foreigners has been cut to 103 per cent of the end-1964 base

IV -4
(or to the 1967 ceiling plus 1/3 of the difference between that
amount and 2 per cent of total assets at end-1966, if that would
produce a larger ceiling). But in addition, the banks are asked
to reduce outstanding term loans to the developed countries of
continental Western Europe as existing loans mature, and also to
cut outstanding short-term credits to these countries by 40 per
cent during the course of 1968. The over-all ceilings of the
banks affected will be reduced correspondingly in order to pre-
vent an offsetting increase in loans to other areas. It is roughly
estimated that outstanding bank credit to continental Western Europe
may be cut back by about $700 million under this program during
1968, while other credits outstanding could increase by as much
as $300 million.
Nonbank financial institutions are to reduce outstanding
covered foreign assets by at least 5 per cent, or about $100 mil-
lion, during 1968, and also to repatriate all liquid assets not
essential to the conduct of their foreign business.
The travel deficit, estimated at $1.6 billion in 1966
and over $2 billion in 1967, had in any case been expected to de-
cline during 1968 as a result of the ending of EXPO 67. The
President now seeks a $500 million improvement on travel. He asks
"the American people to defer for the next two years all nonessen-
tial travel outside the Western Hemisphere." Legislation may be
sought to help cut the travel deficit, and a travel Task Force is

IV -5
seeking new ways to promote travel by foreigners in the United
States.
Measures mentioned in the message to cut net Government
expenditures abroad include increased sales of military goods and
services, foreign official investments in U.S. securities as off-
sets to U.S. military spending, reductions in the number of Ameri-
can civilians working overseas, and cuts in the personal foreign
spending of U.S. forces and their dependents in Europe.
A wide variety of measures to promote U.S. foreign trade
over the long run are mentioned in the Presidential message. These
include intensified trade promotion programs; broader Export-Import
Bank export insurance, guarantees, and financing; and an intensive
effort to secure the removal of nontariff barriers to trade. In
particular, efforts will be made to negotiate changes in the border
taxes and rebates of foreign surplus countries, and in related rules
under the GATT; legislative measures in this area may be proposed.
The President said he expected through these means to
achieve an improvement of at least $500 million in the foreign
trade surplus during 1968. Earlier projections had envisaged
little change from 1967 to 1968, and even those projections proba-
bly required downward revision in the light of the poor trade re-
sults for October-November 1967, discussed below.

IV -6
Changes in U.S. reserve assets. In December reserve assets
declined by approximately $600 million, the result mainly of a re-
duction in the total gold stock of about $900 million and an increase in
convertible currency holdings of around $250 million. There was also a
rise in our IMF gold tranche. The record gold loss was primarily attribu-
table to the November and December Gold Pool deficits, both of which
were settled in December.

Note: This table does not show as financing items debt prepayments by foreign
government, liquidation of securities by U.K, and certain minor special official
transactions. However, increases in foreign official holdings of over-1-year
time deposits are included in the last line.
For the year 1967 as a whole, as shown in the table the re-
duction in the total gold stock was about $1 billion, less than in 1965
but more than in any other year after 1960. There was a very large rise in
U.S. holdings of convertible currencies, mainly sterling. Our IMF gold
tranche rose by somewhat under $100 million. The official settlements
deficit, which is presently estimated at about $3.4 billion had as its
counterpart in addition to a small net decrease in the foregoing classes

IV -7
of reserve assets, an increase of close to $3.4 billion in liquid and
certain nonliquid liabilities to foreign official accounts.
Sales of gold to foreign monetary authorities, either directly
or through the Gold Pool, clearly kept the rise in U.S. liabilities to
foreign official accounts from being even greater than it was. Probably
sales of gold, through the Pool, to foreign private users, hoarders, and
speculators had a similar effect in many cases. But insofar as private
buyers of gold were previously holders of sterling, the drain of gold
from U.S. reserves had as its counterpart some part of the U.S. official
assistance to Britain through the rise in our convertible currency holdings.
U.S. balance of payments. The fourth quarter liquidity defi-
cit, seasonally adjusted, was probably about $2.0 billion. This assumes
a deficit (not adjusted) in December of about $200 million, and this
could be off by perhaps by $100 million in either direction. For the
year the published liquidity deficit would therefore be on the order
of $3.7 billion, compared to $1.4 billion last year.

In the fourth quarter the liquidity deficit was worsened by
special transactions, mainly because of the liquidation of $580 million
of securities by the U.K. Government. Without these and other special
transactions the fourth quarter deficit amounted to about $1.6 billion.
For the year as a whole, however, special transactions reduced the
liquidity deficit by nearly $1 billion, so that the liquidity deficit
would have reached about $4.7 billion without them.
The official settlements deficit in the fourth quarter is
more difficult to estimate because of the wide swings between private
and official accounts that might have occurred at year end. However,
for the quarter this deficit was probably on the order of $1.4 billion,
before seasonal adjustment, and about $1.2 billion seasonally adjusted.
If that estimate is not too far off, the official settlements deficit
for the year would total about $3.4 billion. This balance also was
worsened by the U.K. liquidations, and would have been perhaps $3
billion without these and certain other special transactions.
The deficit for the fourth quarter was much greater than
anticipated, and a full explanation of what happened will require
more information than is yet available. Clearly the trade balance
was much below that of earlier quarters, as described below. If
December trade was no better than the October-November average, the
deterioration from the January-September quarterly average would
amount to $1/2 billion, or a $2 billion annual rate, thus accounting
for much of the worsening in the balance.

IV -9
Information on private capital transactions in the fourth
quarter is limited. In October and November the increase in bank-
reported foreign assets was under $100 million; since the seasonal
pattern of the past included a large fourth quarter outflow, it would
take an extremely large outflow in December to raise the seasonally
adjusted flow for the quarter to an amount close to the adjusted
average of the earlier quarters of the year. Similarly, purchases
of new foreign bonds in the fourth quarter, though substantial, were
lower than the average of prior quarters. On the other hand, foreign
purchases of U.S. corporate securities were probably considerably less
than in the third quarter.
On current account, there may have been some reduction in
travel outlays because of the closing of Expo-67, but this could have
been offset by some reduction in investment income receipts, which
were perhaps temporarily inflated in the third quarter by petroleum
company earnings.
All these changes from the third quarter to the fourth do
not seem to account for as much deterioration as occurred -- about
$800 million before special transactions -- suggesting that some of
the worsening may have been related to other elements, such as higher
direct investment capital outflows or speculative outflows from the
United States.
U.S. foreign trade: The foreign trade surplus in October-
November combined fell sharply to an annual rate of $2.3 billion
(balance of payments basis) compared with over $4 billion in each of

IV -10
the first three quarters of 1967. For the full year 1967 the surplus
is likely to be only slightly above the very low value of $3.7 billion
in calendar 1966, as both exports and imports rose. The trade surplus
in 1963-65 averaged $5.5 billion.

Exports in October-November dropped to an annual rate of $29.8
billion, about 3 per cent below the rate of the third quarter. Part of
the decline reflected ending of emergency petroleum shipments.
Lower shipments of both agricultural and nonagricultural pro-
ducts contributed to the overall drop in exports. Among agricultural
commodities, corn shipments were particularly strong in November as U.S.
prices dipped below those of competing foreign suppliers when the heavy
new U.S. crop was marketed.
By areas, the decline in October-November exports was princi-
pally in shipments to Western Europe, mainly because of the steep drop
in October exports which reflected the termination of emergency oil
shipments and other special events outlined in the last Green Book.
November exports to Western Europe recovered nearly back to the third
quarter rate, however, because of increased deliveries of aircraft.

Iv -11
Shipments to Canada in October-November were sustained at
about the third quarter level by increased deliveries of automobiles
and parts; exports of all other commodities, on balance, declined.
Reversing the steady uptrend in exports to Japan in the first three
quarters, shipments to that country in October-November declined,
even though total Japanese imports increased.
Gains in exports to the less developed countries in Asia
and Africa in October-November reflected mainly P.L. 480 rice shipments
to Viet Nam and Indonesia. But shipments to the Latin American
countries declined.
Imports in October-November were at an annual rate of $27.5
billion, about 3 per cent greater than the previous record rate of
late 1966. November imports were especially large. About two-thirds
of the sharp reduction in the trade surplus from the third quarter to
October-November may be attributed to this rise in imports. Advances
were greatest in imports of industrial materials and nonfood consumer
goods, other than automobiles. Purchases of machinery dipped below
the record amounts of the third quarter and the value of imported
foodstuffs and automotive vehicles showed little change.
Almost all import categories of industrial materials
increased in October-November from third quarter rates. The con-
tinued expansion in arrivals of iron and steel-mill products, with
increases principally in purchases from Germany, is believed to be
the first evidence of hedge buying against an anticipated domestic
steel strike this summer. November steel imports were the highest

IV -12
on record. Even more pronounced was the sharp increase in imports of
other metals, a reversal of the downtrend which had persisted since
the beginning of 1967. While this turnabout may reflect, in part, the
strenghening in domestic industrial output, a considerable portion of
this import increase is in refined copper. With domestic supplies of
copper getting tighter as a result of the copper strike (now in its
sixth month) producers here are turning increasingly to foreign sources
for copper. Imports of refined copper in the month of November alone
were equal to the third quarter total and were nearly as high as the
exceptionally large amount imported in the fourth quarter of 1966 when
inventory buying of copper began. Extensive future contracts for
foreign copper have been made. Even if the strike were to end immedi-
ately, heavy arrivals under such contracts would probably continue for
some time.
Among other industrial materials imports of building supplies
increased further as domestic residential construction remained strong,
while the upturn in purchases of foreign textiles, first evident in
the second quarter, continued through October-November. Imports of
petroleum, which had dipped in the third quarter as a result of the
Arab-Israeli war, also expanded but were still below the normal pre-
crisis rates.
Arrivals of nonfood consumer goods other than cars, which
had shown little change since the first quarter, resumed their long-
term upward movement in October-November. Both nondurable and durable
items shared in the latest advance. While the value of total imports

IV -13
of automotive vehicles was unchanged from third quarter rates, a decline
in October-November arrivals from Canada was offset by a rise in imports
from Europe and Japan. The pause in Canadian car imports in October-
November was probably temporary and further expansion can be expected
as integration of the U.S. and Canadian automotive industries proceeds.
Sales of foreign cars (excluding Canadian cars) have accounted for about
11 per cent of total automotive sales in the last half of 1967 com-
pared with about 8.5 per cent in the first half and 7 per cent in
calendar 1966.
Bank-reported outflows. Total bank-reported claims on
foreigners increased in November by approximately $60 million, making
the 11-month net outflow $280 million. Outflows in December, expected
on seasonal grounds, may swell the year's total considerably. Through
November, short-term claims rose $500 million and long-term claims
declined more than $200 million, net. Short-term claims rose largely
through an increase in acceptance credits to Japan in the first half
of the year. A large decline in long-term claims during the first
half -- particularly to Continental Europe, Japan, and the U.K --
continued a trend initiated back in February 1965 when the Interest
Equalization Tax was applied to non-export credits to foreigners in
"developed" countries other than Canada. Since mid-year, term loans
outstanding have risen by $120 million, with increases largely in
loans to Latin America and Canada.
New security issues. Sales of new foreign securities to
U.S. residents in the fourth quarter continued at a high rate, well

IV -14
over $350 million. Nevertheless, sales were much reduced from the
exceptionally high third-quarter sales of about a half billion. For
the year as a whole, the record high $1.6 billion of issues is about
$400 million above the plateau maintained in the years since inception
of the Interest Equalization Tax in 1963.
Up to the third quarter there were increasingly large
flotations by Israel, an IET-exempt country, and by international
organizations, whose issues are also exempt from the tax. Takedowns
on Canadian issues, also exempt, were relatively constant, being
consistently above $200 million each quarter. The decline in flota-
tions in the fourth quarter resulted from much reduced borrowing by
international organizations and virtual drying up of issues from
countries other than Canada.
No further slackening in sales of new foreign issues is
anticipated in the near term. New issues already scheduled for
the first quarter of this year total close to $300 million.

The international bond market outside the United States. New
"foreign bond" issues (those placed in a national market foreign to the
borrower and denominated in the currency of that market) and "Euro-bond"
issues (those denominated in dollars or other currencies foreign to the
market or markets where offered) reached a record two-month total of
over $600 million last September and October, Toward the end of the year
the flow of new issues diminished, partly for seasonal reasons. The year's
total nevertheless reached a new record of $2.3 billion. In contrast to
the two preceding years, when growth of U.S. companies' issues accounted
for most of the growth in total issues, last year there was more than a
doubling of issues by others. The new U.S. policy program will add greatly
to demands for funds in the Euro-bond market in 1968.

Yields on Euro-dollar bonds in the secondary market eased off
in early 1967, but rose later, especially in May-June and again in
October-November. These movements resembled those for corporate bond yields
in the United States, but with less of an upward drfit. The spread between
Euro-dollar bond and U.S. bond yields has narrowed markedly in the past
two years, and especially since mid-1967. In early 1966, Moody's Aa
bonds yielded under 5 per cent and U.S. companies' Euro-dollar bonds about

IV -16
6-1/4 per cent. At mid-1967, the two yields were respectively 5.69
and 6.63 per cent, and at the end of November they were 6.32 and 6.66
per cent. The relative stability of domestic German mark bond yields in
recent months -- at about 7 per cent for outstanding issues and slightly
less on newly issued bonds -- has been an important factor restraining
the rise in Euro-bond yields.
Euro-dollar market. Announcement of the U.S. balance of pay-

between the last Wednesday of the month and the last business day (Friday,
the 29th) as they had done at the end of 1966. The net increase in the
fourth quarter amounted to $0.2 billion. During the year 1967 there was
an increase of $0.6 billion, but on the last-Wednesday-to-last-Wednesday basis
the increase over the year was only about $0.1 billion.
The narrowing of forward discounts on the pound sterling since
Christmas has not gone far enough yet to bring switching out of Euro-
dollars into local authority or hire-purchase finance company paper.
With the decline in spot exchange rates for the DM in the past
two weeks, forward premiums on the DM have widened again (to 3.0 per cent
for the 3-month contract). An article recently published by the Bundesbank,
summarized in Appendix A, contains much detailed information about German
banks' foreign assets and liabilities. One interesting observation is
that the Bundesbank's offering of special forward rates to the German
banks near the end of November led to much less of an outflow of funds
to the Euro-dollar market than might have been expected from the amount
of swaps executed.

IV -18
Business conditions abroad. For several months before the
sterling devaluation in mid-November, British consumer expenditures
and residential construction outlays were rising. However, with weak-
ness in British exports and manufacturing investment, industrial pro-
duction remained flat.
German data through October and November show that the up-
swing there was gaining momentum, and had begun to have an expansive
influence on neighboring countries. But despite renewed rise in German
imports, the export surplus has remained very large. An extraordinary
degree of price and wage stability was achieved in Germany last year
and the competitive position of German goods in many markets has improved.
Developments in other European countries (through September
or October) were mixed, with the beginning of possible upturns in France
and the Netherlands contrasting with less buoyant conditions in several
other countries. In Canada output rose through last spring and summer --
at least to September. Japanese production was still increasing strongly
through October, after two years of upswing.
In Germany, a sustained recovery from last spring's low point
is now clearly under way, with industrial production up 5 per cent by
October-November on average. New orders have been on the rise since
the beginning of the year, and unfilled orders began to increase around
midyear. Since then there have also been indications of restocking of
inventories, despite tax disadvantages many producers felt might be in-
volved in acquiring inventories before the institution of the value added
tax at New Year. Increases in orders have come from both domestic and
foreign buyers, and output has risen in both durable and nondurable goods
sector.

Because industry has ample unused capacity, fixed capital in-
vestment prospects have remained weak.
In the labor market, unemployment (which reached its peak
last May) was further reduced in September and October, and job vacancies
increased a little in October. From mid-1966 to mid-1967 the rise in
hourly earnings had slowed greatly; in July, hourly earnings in manu-
facturing were less than 3 per cent above their year-earlier level.
German exports, which were falling in the earlier months of
1967, began to rise again in June, and in September-October were about
3 per cent greater than in the second quarter. Imports responded, with
no apparent lag, to the revival of internal activity, their level in
September-October being nearly 4 per cent above the second quarter.
French industrial production increased 2 per cent in September
and fractionally further in October, these being the first changes in19671967

nearly a year that reflected other than accidental influences. Much
of the rise was concentrated in automobiles, but output of other metal
manufactures also advanced. A rise in exports of about 3 per cent from
the second quarter to September-October was presumably a factor in the
rise of production.
According to the surveys of business opinion, changes between
July and November were generally favorable. Stocks of finished goods
were reduced, in both the equipment and consumer goods industries.
Order backlogs rose in the equipment industries and stopped declining
in the consumer goods industries, though backlogs continued to shrink
in industries producing intermediate goods. Manufacturers' expectations
about the next 3-4 months also brightened, mainly because producers of
consumer goods foresaw an end to the decline in their output.
French unemployment was still rising in October. The rise
in hourly wage rates in the 12 months to October was 6 per cent, approxi-
mately the average annual rate of increase for the past three years.
Italian domestic demand appears to have been increasing more
slowly in the summer and early autumn than before. This may have been
a temporary pause due to repercussions of a dip in exports. At all
events, exports in the third quarter were down 3 per cent from the second
quarter, while industrial production was down by a similar proportion --
subject to substantial uncertainties regarding the appropriate seasonal
adjustments. In September and October Italian exports were again rising,
and in September industrial output was up. Meanwhile Italian imports
continued to increase throughout the summer and early autumn.

IV- 21
Industrial output of investment goods was appreciably higher
in September than at the beginning of 1967, and accounted for all of
the gain in total industrial production over the first nine months of
1967.
Elsewhere on the Continent, exports of the Netherlands were
sharply higher in August-October than earlier and Dutch industrial pro-
duction in August-September was also at a new high. Dutch unemployment
has exceeded job vacancies since early last year, but stopped rising
after May. In several other countries, conditions were less buoyant
during the autumn. There was no marked increase in any major category
of demand in Sweden. no sign of recovery appeared in Belgium, and activity
remained sluggish in Switzerland.
In Britain, the period since devaluation has been too brief
to produce evidence of changes in trends. Through October total in-
dustrial production remained close to the level to which it had fallen
by the end of 1966. Manufacturing output (75 per cent of the total)
declined 2 per cent from its July peak to October. The unemployment
rate reached a high of 2.4 per cent in August and September, and stood
at 2.3 per cent in October, November, and December.
This over-all picture of slack demand for manufactures was
the result of opposing tendencies: on the one hand, a strong rise in
consumer buying after the relaxation of instalment credit regulations
last summer; but on the other hand a further decline in exports and, in
the third quarter, a running down of inventories.
Despite the new tightening of instalment credit at the time
of the devaluation, early reports of Christmas trade suggest continued

IV- 22
buoyancy of consumer demand. The rise in incomes has been an important
factor. Weekly wage rates in November were up 3.4 per cent from June.
About half of this increase occurred in July, immediately after the
end of the period of "severe restraint."
British exports in the third quarter were 2 per cent lower
in value, and 4 per cent lower in volume, than in the second quarter.
Subsequently, they were sharply lower in October and November, running
20 per cent under the third quarter rate, partly in reflection of dock
strikes in London and Liverpool. Expectations of a change in the sterling
exchange rate, whch undoubtedly induced British exporters and foreign
importers to put off payments for British exports, may also have con-
tributed to postponing sales and shipments.
Some categories of construction activity were rising strongly
through the third quarter, with increases in private residential con-
struction and in fixed investment in the public sector. Private fixed
investment, however, tended to decline. A further decline in manufacturing
fixed investment in the fourth quarter seemed probably on the basis of a
survey of intentions conducted in August and September. As for the 1968
outlook, a Financial Times survey in December indicated that the devalu-
ation and accompanying measures had made business circles less, rather
than more, optimistic about demand next year and that companies were con-
sequently reducing their estimates of 1968 investment expenditures.
Canadian industrial production rose at an annual rate of about
5 per cent from the first to the third quarter of 1967. Output dropped
in October, but would have registered a small gain in the absence of
strikes. The unemployment rate, after rising in the first half of 1967,

IV- 23
tended to stabilize in July-November and was 4.3 per cent in
November.
New orders in manufacturing turned upward last summer. How-
ever, high manufacturers' inventories continued to exert a damping in-
fluence; through August (latest) the ratio of inventories to shipments
was about 7 per cent above the 1965 normal. Housing starts, which
were picking up sharply in the spring, fell back in the third quarter,
apparently because of tighter financial markets.
Price advances have continued at a relatively rapid rate in
Canada despite unutilized manpower and plant capacity. The consumer
price index in the third quarter was 4 per cent above a year earlier.
In response, the government has announced a personal income tax in-
crease for 1968, and is reportedly making strenuous efforts to restrain
expenditure increases in the budget for the next fiscal year beginning
on April 1.
Japanese industrial production increased further in October,
when it was 19.5 per cent above a year earlier. This rise compares
with 18 per cent in the first year of the present upswing, from October 1965
to October 1966. Department store sales, especially of durable consumer
goods and clothing, were very strong in September and October.
Some early signs of an eventual slowing of the cyclical up-
spwing have appeared. New orders for machinery have leveled off since
midyear, but as they are still high and current output has not yet caught
up, unfilled orders have continued to build up. Producers' inventories
of manufactures, which began to increase last spring, rose somewhat more
rapidly in September and October. The strong rise in imports has continued,

IV -24
and with exports dropping off after a temporary bulge in early autumn,
the trade balance worsened moderately in October and November.
Both wholesale and consumer prices have been rising. In
November, wholesale prices were about 3 per cent higher than a year
earlier and consumer prices were up 6 per cent. In November, whole-
sale prices rose 0.5 per cent while consumer prices were unchanged.
Business demand for credit has been strong, but banks have
pursued cautious lending policies. Bank credit has expanded at a steady
annual rate of about 16 per cent in recent months. Late in December
the Bank of Japan announced that it would tighten credit conditions
further, and in the first quarter of 1968 it will restrain the credit
expansion of the 13 large city banks to only 70 per cent of the increase
in the same period a year earlier.

APPENDIX A: THE NET FOREIGN ASSET POSITION OF GERMAN COMMERCIAL BANKS*
Over the past year and a half, the short-term foreign position
of German commercial banks has shifted from a rather substantial net
debtor position, customary ever since the war to a very substantial
net asset position. The banks' net foreign position changed by the
equivalent of $860 million from June 1966 to September 1967; in the
next two months there was a further increase in net assets of about
$165 million, to an estimated over-all net asset position of $695 mil-
lion at the end of November. The shift in the banks' position came
mainly from a build-up in gross assets, which exceeded $2.3 billion at
September 30; liabilities changed little.
The large export of German bank funds since mid-1966 was
the consequence of two developments: the appearance of a growing
current account surplus and, since the beginning of 1967, the emergence
of increasingly liquid conditions in German financial markets as the
result of an agressively expansionary German monetary policy. Throughout
1967 these two factors steadily increased the supply of loanable funds in
the hands of German banks. Domestic demand for funds, however, was
limited as the economy made its way out of the recession only slowly.
Short-term interest rates in Germany fell markedly after the beginning
of 1967. As a result, a substantial interest arbitrage incentive appeared
favoring investments in major financial centers outside of Germany. Early
in 1967 German banks were led by higher interest rates to invest in
sterling money market paper and Euro-dollar deposits. Later, growing
uneasiness as to the future of the pound produced a widening of the
forward discount on sterling which eliminated the incentive of German
banks to place funds in U.K. paper. German banks continued to place
funds in the Euro-dollar market throughout the year.
The normal movement of funds was disturbed in November by
the sterling crisis. In the first three weeks of November speculative
inflows into Germany raised gross foreign liabilities of German
commercial banks (mainly in DM) by approximately $100 million. However,
the German banks' foreign assets also increased during that period, and
increased still further toward the end of the month as a result of
Bundesbank intervention in the forward exchange market.
The Bundesbank made DM/dollar swaps available to the
commercial banks at favorable rates, as part of central bank cooperation
to calm the November foreign exchange crisis; the purpose was to keep

Section, Division of International Finance.

the forward discount on the U.S. dollar from widening further and
thus to encourage a return flow of funds into dollars. The Bundesbank
sold the banks dollars spot, and DM forward. Three-month forward DM
were initially offered at a cost of 1-3/4 per cent compared to the
prevailing market rate of almost 3 per cent. The Bundesbank raised
this rate in two steps, on November 29 and December 1, to 2-1/4 per cent.
In the last four days of November, the Bundesbank swapped
out $375 million. According to a special article in the latest Monthly
Report of the Bundesbank, approximately $100 million of the November
swaps were used for new foreign money market investments by the German
commercial banks. The forward side of the rest of these swaps was used
as cover for export transactions or for outstanding investments which
had originally been covered at higher cost; apparently the banks sold
off the spot dollars they obtained. An additional $225 million of swaps
were executed in the first five business days of December (the latest
available information).
The currency composition of German banks' foreign assets and liabilities
Despite the strong pressures and movements which characterized
foreign exchange markets during the past year, there was little change in
the currency composition of German banks' foreign assets and liabilities
during that period. As of September, 57 per cent of the banks' foreign
assets and 80 per cent of the liabilities were denominated in marks.
(See Table 1.) While by far the major part of the liabilities have for
years been in DM, this is a more recent development on the asset side.
The proportion of assets held in DM increased substantially during 1962,
1963, and 1964, primarily at the expense of dollar-denominated assets,
and reached 50 per cent of the total only in 1964.
Assets in U.S. dollars compose the other major portion of the
German banks' foreign position. At the end of September, approximately
one-third, or $800 million, of total foreign assets were denominated in
dollars. A large part of this total consisted of Euro-dollar deposits
held primarily in London banks (including U.S. branches); the remainder
represented working balances reported as sight deposits. On the liability
side, dollars are a much less important part of the total. Of total
liabilities to foreigners amounting to $1.8 billion at the end of
September, only 14 per cent or $250 million were payable in dollars.
Foreign position according to country of deposit
The banks' creditor and debtor positions vis-a-vis various
countries showed marked shifts last year. One of the most striking
movements was the large-scale export of short-term funds to the Euro-
dollar market in London. The banks' net short-term assets in the

United Kingdom rose about $480 million between September 30, 1966
and September 30, 1967. (See Table 2.) This represented almost
entirely an increase in gross short-term assets, particularly time
deposits, of which the largest part were dollar deposits. Net
Euro-dollar claims of German banks against the U.K. equaled $377 mil-
lion at the end of September, as compared with only $66 million a
year earlier. Most of the remaining increase of about $170 million
in German banks' net claims against the U.K. represented a rise in
DM-denominated assets. German banks maintained only a very small
position in sterling.

The German banks' export of dollars to London reflected the
strong demand for funds on the Euro-dollar market, originating in good
part from European branches of U.S. banks soliciting funds for their
home offices, and also from European subsidiaries of American companies
seeking financing outside U.S. markets. The combination of relatively
high interest rates and availability of increasingly diversified debt
instruments has apparently made the Euro-dollar market an increasingly
attractive investment center to German banks in recent years. Conversely,

A- 5
German banks further reduced their short-term investments in the
United States in 1967. As a result, their net position with the
United States shifted from net assets of $47 million in September
1966 to net liabilities of $27 million in September 1967.
The EEC countries comprised the second area where German
banks strongly expanded their net claims. The net position of the
banks rose between mid-1966 and September 1967 by the equivalent of
about $440 million. In this case, however, the improvement was
principally the result of increased DM assets. Gross DM assets of
German banks in other Common Market countries rose by the equivalent
of $300 million; gross assets denominated in other currencies decreased
$35 million. The remaining $175 million improvement in the banks'
over-all position vis-a-vis EEC countries represented a decline in
liabilities. Part of the strong demand of the Common Market countries
for DM credit was undoubtedly the counterpart of their cumulative trade
deficit with Germany, which totaled DM 3.3 billion in the January-
September period.
