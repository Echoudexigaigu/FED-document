CURRENT ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL CONDITIONS

Board of Governors

I- 1
SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK
Outlook for economic activity
We anticipate a sharp increase in final sales this quarter
and some further increase in inventory investment. Total GNP is
expected to rise at an accelerated rate in both current and constant
dollars.
Despite recent indications of a less buoyant consumption
picture, a substantial increase in consumer outlays continues to be a
strong likelihood this quarter. Disposable income should continue to
accelerate, and even if the savings rate remains high, consumer outlays
for goods and services should increase by over $10 billion, almost
double the rise in the fourth quarter.
GNP will also be buoyed by moderately rising Federal expendi-
tures, including a rise in defense spending which earlier had been
expected to level off. The rise in expenditures, in the absence of a
tax increase, would leave the Federal deficit (NIA basis)very high
although below recent levels, as accelerated growth in incomes boosts
revenues at existing tax rates.
A further moderate increase in residential expenditures is
likely this quarter, given the recent behavior of housing starts and
construction prices. And if earlier survey results prove correct,
spending for plant and equipment should show an abrupt increase. Some
further rise in inventory investment is projected, but given the large
increase in inventories last quarter--much larger than had been antici-
pated earlier--and the expected gains in consumer spending, the further
inventory rise should be moderate.

I- 2
Outlook for resource use and prices
Industrial production is projected as averaging 163 in
the current quarter--for a rise of something less than a point a
month as compared with 2-1/2 points a month in the immediate post-
strike recovery in November and December. The rise during the quarter
would be in line with the ongoing expansion in capacity and would leave
the capacity utilization rate only slightly above the December level
of 85.3 per cent.
The projection anticipates further expansion in steel out-
put (as inventory accumulation increases as a hedge against a midyear
strike), further recovery in business equipment (in line with the
sharp step-up projected for outlays), some additional increase in
defense output, and continuing gains in the nondurable sector where
output has moved up steadily since last June to a new high in December
almost 2-1/2 per cent above a year earlier. No further rise in auto
output is expected, and, unless sales pick up soon, production schedules
in February and March may be reduced.
The projected rise in industrial--and non-industrial--output
is large enough to absorb continued rapid growth in the labor force
and the unemployment rate should continue at about the low December
rate of 3.7 per cent.
Additional upward pressure on wages in the current quarter
will come in manufacturing from the contract settlement at G.M. with
its 7-1/2 per cent first-year wage increase, and in nonmanufacturing
(particularly service and trade industries) from the increase in the

I- 3
minimum wage. Unit labor costs in manufacturing showed an inexplicable
drop in December, but even disregarding this deop, the rise over the
last half of 1967 was slower than from mid-1966 to mid-1967. Despite
the sustained upward movement in sight in wages, stepped-up productivity
gains should continue to act to moderate the rise in unit labor costs.
Wholesale prices of industrial commodities have continued to
rise at a rapid pace--in fact, since October the pace has accelerated,
mainly as a result of the sharp spurt in prices of copper and cotton
because of drastically limited domestic supplies. The effects of
these and other price increases for materials continue to spread to
fabricated products, providing sustained upward momentum to the
industrial price average over the near-term. Moreover, since November
prices of farm products have moved up and retail prices of foods began
to rise again in December. As had been anticipated, however, the rise
in retail prices of other commodities slowed at year-end, and continuing
increases in the CPI at the recent 3-1/2 per cent rate appears
likely.
Demand for credit
Credit demands are expected to continue to be relatively
strong over the next few months, though remaining below the peak demands
of the second half of last year. Continuation of credit demands at
near the recent pace suggests that interest rates are not likely to
decline much further. In fact, it is possible that some updrift in
longer-term yields could develop, particularly those on Ui..S. Government

I-4
securities and mortgages where interest rates appear low relative to
competing instruments. Yields on corporate bonds, however, may show
little change, or possibly edge off, from their current advanced levels.
The near-term volume of corporate bond offerings, including
private placements, is not expected to be very different than in
January, when these offerings were high by any standards other than
the second half of 1967. But in contrast to last year, there are no
present indications of a tendency for corporate bond issues to
cumulate, and the volume of public bond offerings may be tapering.
Businesses appear likely to show a relatively greater preference for
financing through short-term borrowing than they did last year, since
a larger proportion of financing needs will arise from greater in-
ventory accumulation, and since concern about the availability and cost
of funds in the future appears to have abated. Therefore, loan growth
at banks is likely to remain above the relatively low $300 million
a month pace of late summer and fall, although probably below the
exceptionally rapid expansion in December-January.
The Federal Government will continue to be a sizable net
borrower in credit markets in the near term, until tax receipts increase
seasonally during the spring. About $ 4 billion or so in new cash
may be raised in the weeks immediately ahead in connection with the
mid-February refunding, which is likely to include an intermediate-term
offering as one of its options, and through other means, such as
addition to the weekly bill auctions. Moreover, not much relief

I -5
appears in sight from the continuing heavy volume of new State and
local government issues.
The blow of mortgage funds is likely to continue near its
recent pace for the next few months, after allowance for seasonal
influences, in view of the backlog of institutional commitments.
However, institutions have reduced their rate of commitment growth
most recently, and mortgage borrowing is likely to slow down as spring
progresses, assuming there is no reversal in the recent more moderate
net inflows of funds to savings institutions.
Supply of funds
Growth in time and savings deposits at banks and savings
accounts at thrift institutions did not slow down as much in January
as market participants had feared, and this has probably contributed
to the improved tone of credit markets in the past few weeks.. But
supply factors are not likely to contribute to a significant further
easing of credit conditions, given continued relatively strong credit
demands.
There has recently been sizable bank demand for new municipal
security offerings but it is not clear that this can persist for any
considerable time in face of anticipated business loan and U.S.
Government credit demands and little prospect of a significant pickup
in savings flows. And while pressures on the liquidity positions
of savings institutions and the Home Loan Bank System have been less
than feared, continuing uncertainties with respect to savings flows

I- 6
to thrift institutions during the spring are likely to inhibit any
significant liberalization of institutional mortgage commitment
policies.
Banks this year have not yet made strenuous efforts to
capture highly volatile short-term money, although they have been
able to restore more than half the CD run-off experienced in December.
Over the past few weeks, banks have reduced offering rates on CD's,
especially those with relatively short maturities, by more than the
decline in bill yields. Other funds have been readily available to
banks through expansion in demand deposits, Treasury tax and loan
accounts, and Euro-dollar borrowings. Some of the expansion in demand
deposits appears to be temporary, though. In the months ahead, growth
in such deposits will very likely diminish as deposit holders re-
structure their asset positions, given current relatively high interest
rates and the abatement of uncertainties generated by such factors
as the new balance of payments program. Banks will probably then
have to become more active in seeking CD money if they are to
accommodate loans without drawing on their liquidity.
Balance of payments
The worsening of the overall balance in the fourth quarter
turns out to have been almost entirely explainable by changes in
merchandise trade rather than by speculative capital flows. The
annual rate of trade surplus dropped abruptly from $4.4 billion in
the third quarter to $1.5 billion in the fourth. During this period,

I- 7
the liquidity deficit before special transactions increased by about
the same amount. The increase was larger than this after special
transactions since in the fourth quarter these included the liquida-
tion by the British Government of its holdings of U.S. securities.
For the full year 1967, the deficits measured before and after
all special transactions (including-as special the German purchases of
medium-term securities) were $4.6 billion and $3.6 billion,
respectively on the liquidity basis, and $2.9 billion and $3.4
billion on the reserve transactions basis. By any of these measures,
the deficit was the largest since 1960.
The sharp rise in imports in November and December came
as a considerable surprise and disappointment. Even if exports began
to expand more rapidly than imports in 1968, it is likely that the
trade surplus for this year as a whole will be significantly smaller
than the 1967 surplus, whereas the President recently stated that the
aim should be to make it $1/2 billion larger. Hence, even with a net
improvement of around $2 billion on flows of U.S. private capital
this year over last, and improvement on some nontrade current items,
the overall deficit is likely to remain substantial in 1968.

THE ECONOMIC PICTURE IN DETAIL
The Nonfinancial Scene
Gross national product. Growth in GNP is expected to
accelerate this quarter, if consumer demand keeps pace with anticipated
gains in consumer income. Although current dollar GNP rises at an
annual rate of $19.5 billion in our projection, compared to $16.4
billion last quarter, the step-up in final demand is much greater--
from $11.3 billion to $18.4 billion. Inventory growth is expected to
rise somewhat further this quarter as stock-building continues in
major industries, but the unexpectedly sharp rise in accumulation in
the fourth quarter is unlikely to be repeated.
Most of the projected increase in GNP for this quarter
derives from a sharp upturn--expected but not yet evident--in consumer
spending. A pronounced rise in sales should occur in response to an
accelerated increase in spendable income, without requiring any signif-
icant reduction in the rate of saving. Total government spending is
scheduled to continue to expand at about the same rate as in the
previous quarter. Investment in plant and equipment is expected to
turn up sharply, the largest rise since mid-1966, according to the
November plant and equipment survey. Residential outlays should edge
up further, judging from previous starts and outstanding lending
commitments.
The 9.7 per cent annual rate of increase in current dollar
GNP in the first quarter represents a 6 per cent real growth as prices

II -2
continue to rise rapidly; this is a sharp acceleration from the 4.5
per cent real growth rate in the fourth quarter.
Disposable income in the current quarter is expected to
rise considerably faster than in the last three quarters of last year;
even after adjustment for price increases, the rise should be the
largest since the first quarter of 1967. Factors contributing to the
acceleration have been detailed in previous Greenbooks--the continued
large gains in employment and wage-rates, the $2.3 billion to be added
to the annual income flow by the minimum wage increase, effective
February 1, the initiation of higher old-age pensions in March, and
finally, as compared to the fourth quarter, less loss of income from
strikes. While most of the income rise is attributable to wages and
salaries, other types of income should also expand. Interest payments
are showing a strong upward trend as an increasing proportion of debt
is financed at higher rates.
The rise in consumer expenditures projected for the first
quarter is in line with the expected increase in spendable income and
recent saving propensities; it implies a very small reduction from the
7.5 per cent saving rate attained in the fourth quarter to about 7.3
per cent. On the other hand, the projected increase of 8.5 per cent
in consumption at an annual rate is much larger than has occurred for
several quarters, as both the durable and nondurable categories expand
more rapidly than earlier. However, the behavior of consumers over
the past year was exceptionally cautious. Although disposable income
rose by 4.3 per cent in 1967, the gain in real consumption, after

II -3
adjustment for prices increases, was only 2.8 per cent. Not only were
purchases of durable goods very low in relation to the increase in
income, but nondurable goods outlays--which are usually more closely
linked to population and income increases--also lagged.
Although the fourth quarter showed some improvement in
durable goods purchases, despite the auto strike, expansion in non-
durable goods sales appears to have continued to be unusually slow.
Such pronounced and unusual weakness in consumer spending for non-
durable goods probably will not persist much longer, in view of both
income and population increases.
As a result, our projection of consumption in the first
quarter, in addition to recognizing the factors which should result in
considerably higher purchases of automobiles and household durable
goods, would restore a more normal relation between income increases
and nondurable goods purchases. Service expenditures are assumed to
continue on a rising trend.
The outlook for automobile sales remains somewhat uncertain.
Consumers do not seem to be exhibiting the enthusiasm for the new
models which would justify us in continuing to anticipate a sales rate
of 8.5 million domestic units this quarter, as shown in the last
Greenbook. le have accordingly reduced our estimates to 8.0 million,
compared to an actual sales rate of 7.25 million in the strike-affected
fourth quarter. The rising rate of completions of new homes should
stimulate sales of both durable and nondurable furnishings, although
the number of new homes available for sale this quarter will still be
low.

II -4
All in all, the projected increase in consumption seems
conservative; normally, a sharper decline in saving would be anticipated
with the increase in the flow of income to lower income groups, such
as pensioners, and minimum wage reciepents. However, in view of wide-
spread fears of inflation and other evidences of uncertainty disclosed
in surveys of consumer attitudes, a substantial decline in the saving
rate may be delayed for some time. This quarter, however, the income
rise is likely to be so large that consumer outlays should almost
double the fourth quarter rise merely by keeping pace with growth in
spendable income.
An upsurge at an annual rate of $3 billion in plant and
equipment outlays this quarter was predicted in the November official
survey of business investment plans. Since the forecast for the second
quarter indicated only a slight further rise, however, it is possible
that the projected first quarter spurt will be phased out over a longer
period. The rise is expected to center in private utilities, although
outlays in manufacturing also are expected to increase at a faster
rate. The indicated advance in industrial output should cause the
utilization of capacity in manufacturing to rise to 85.4 per cent.
This would be one percentage point above the fourth quarter average
but only slightly above the December level.
Housing starts in the fourth quarter averaged 1.45 million
at an annual rate--a little lower than shown in the last Greenbook--
because of an unanticipated decline from a 1.6 million rate in November
to 1.25 million in December. This drop can in part be attributed to

II -5
the reduced number of working days and the severe weather. The rise
in permit applications in December, however, indicates underlying
strength in demand as well as possible fears of future tightness in
mortgage money. However, funds will probably be sufficient to continue
starts in the first quarter at the fourth quarter rate of 1.45 million.
The dollar volume of construction should continue to rise somewhat.
Nonfarm inventory accumulation, after coming to a virtual
halt in the second quarter, rose to a rate of $3.4 billion in the
third quarter and to an estimated $7.5 billion in the final quarter of
1967, over $2 billion more than we had projected. Although dealers'
auto stocks rose appreciably, about half the rise in inventories in
the fourth quarter was in other types of nondefense goods.
Despite a drop in November, the inventory-sales ratio for
durable goods exceeded that of November last year, and, in view of
disappointing retail sales in December, it probably was higher by
year-end and as high or higher than at the end of 1966, preceding the
inventory readjustment. Despite this, most businessmen do not report
dissatisfaction with their stocks. Rising sales and favorable antic-
ipations are expected to lead to moderate further and across-the-board
accumulation of inventories this quarter; moreover, stockpiling of
steel at a rapid rate and a further buildup in auto inventories is
expected. Work-in-process for defense is still rising, although at a
slower rate than earlier this year. In total, nonfarm inventory
accumulation is expected to increase from an annual rate of $7.5
billion to $9.5 billion. Inventory building on farms, however, is
expected to increase much less than in the fourth quarter.

II -6
Net exports in the fourth quarter apparently plunged to a
rate of about $3.1 billion, from $5.4 billion in the previous period,
according to unpublished estimates, whereas the published estimates
indicate that the fourth quarter rate was $4 billion (this figure is
still carried in the Greenbook in order to be consistent with the
official GNP series for the fourth quarter). Exports were disappointing
and imports much higher than had been hoped. It is now expected that
net exports will increase at a rate of $800 million in the current
quarter from the very low fourth quarter level. This increase would
be $500 million larger than estimated in the previous Greenbook.

*The Commerce preliminary estimate of net exports of goods and services for 67-IV,
$4.0 billion as shown here, will be revised down when December trade balance data are in-
corporated in the estimate. The December data suggest the figure may be only $3.1 billion
(with GNP reduced correspondingly). On this basis we estimate net exports in 68-I at $3.9

Industrial production. While there are only scattered and
incomplete data on which to base an estimate, it seems likely that the
upward movement in output of the past few months, aside from the gains
because of major strike settlements, continued in January. Industrial
production probably increased further by between a half and one point
from the preliminary December level of 161.6 per cent, to another new
high in January.
Output of crude oil increased further and production of some
textile and chemical products probably rose. Output of refined
petroleum products declined and production of raw steel, despite sharp
increases in the last two weeks of January, failed to rise seasonally.
Output of commercial aircraft and defense equipment is expected to
have increased and the settlement of the Deere strike at the end of
December added about .3 of one point to the total January index.
Auto assemblies in January had been scheduled at an annual
rate of 8.9 million units, the same as in December, but actual output
may not have reached that rate because of strikes (now settled) at
some G.M. plants. Output schedules for February and March, which had
been set at around the January rate, will probably be cut back to
rates more in line with sales of domestic units, which have recently
been at about a 7.8 million rate, unless sales pick up soon.
Output of other consumer durable goods, which by November
had fully recovered from midyear lows, declined in December. Produc-
tion of TV sets and some appliances was cut back as factory stocks
rose rapidly from June to November. In early January, retail sales

II -10
of these goods were sluggish and TV output continued at the December
rate.
Industrial production in the last half of 1967 rose at an
annual rate of 8 per cent, but the underlying movement was obscured
by numerous strikes in that period. The following table shows the
published industrial production total index, the estimated strike
losses as points in the total index (direct effects only), and an
index adjusted for the strike losses.

Capacity utilization. Utilization of capacity by manu-
facturers was estimated to be 85.3 per cent in December, up one full
point from the previous month. Little change is expected in January.
A large part of the December increase can be attributed to the auto
strike settlement. Increased auto production accounted directly for
about one-half the increase in manufacturing output.

II -11
The operating rate for manufacturing is still well below
the 91.0 per cent recorded in June 1966 and substantial amounts of
unused capacity remain. Pressures on capacity, however, vary from
industry to industry. Recent production increases in the textile,
petroleum, and rubber industries have brought operating rates to levels
which are high relative to historical experience. Production of air-
craft and electric generating equipment has been at near capacity
levels for at least a year. Steel capacity is difficult to estimate
but despite recent production increases it would appear that margin
of unused capacity remains.

Orders and shipments. New orders received by manufacturers
of durable goods jumped 9.5 per cent in December according to advance
Census Bureau figures. While this rise is subject to revision and
while a part of this extraordinary increase can be attributed to
special situations and what may be imperfect seasonal adjustment, the
rise nevertheless appears to be quite significant.

II -12
New orders--which had risen sharply from earlier lows in
the spring--leveled off in midsummer and in October were slightly below
their June levels. Part of this slowdown in the recovery was due to
strikes and to the erratic behavior of the aircraft orders series.
Beginning with November, new orders for durables picked up sharply
and the December increases brought the series 3 per cent above its
previous record high of September 1966. Moreover, every major industry
shared in the latest increase and unfilled orders and shipments also
registered strong advances.
Several special factors helped account for the December
increase. Orders for motor vehicles rose 10 per cent from a November
level still depressed by the Ford strike, and aircraft orders were up
from an unusually low level the previous month. Iron and steel orders
rose 13 per cent as buyers attempted to accumulate inventories in
anticipation of a possible steel strike. At their December level,
steel orders were about equal to the peak reached in the inventory
buildup preceding the labor contract expiration in 1965. Even if both
transportation equipment and iron and steel orders are excluded from
the total, durable goods orders were still up 7.6 per cent in December.
New orders for machinery and equipment rose sharply in
December to a new high. Increases in this area, however, were not
uniform. Machine tool orders turned up in December, but after falling
steadily all year to the lowest levels since 1964; moreover, machine
tool shipments continued well above orders.

II -13
Unfilled orders for durable goods rose 1.2 per cent in
December, continuing the increase which began last May. At the end
of 1967, backlogs represented 3.2 months shipments, about the same
relationship that prevailed a year earlier. Unfilled orders for
aircraft rose throughout last year. Order backlogs for durable goods
other than aircraft have now recovered most of the losses sustained
early last year and have risen sharply in the last two months.
Shipments (sales) of durable goods by manufacturers increased
6 per cent in December and, with the latest increase, were a similar
percentage above the record level of a year earlier. Strong gains were
recorded in December in all major industries. Auto shipments were up
sharply but this accounted for only a small part of the total gain.
Shipments of durable goods increased last summer and by
August, the month before the auto strike, had recovered most of the
losses sustained early in the year.

Residential construction. Seasonally adjusted private
housing starts, which had soared to a 1.59 million annual rate in
November, dropped by a fifth in December to the lowest rate--1.26
million--since last June. The decline affected all types of structures
and all regions. A more-than-seasonal decline was expected in December
mainly because of the sharp rise and unsustainably high rate reported
for November. In November some builders apparently had accelerated
their schedules, as lender commitments were high but lender hesitancy
about future prospects was increasing. In addition, unusually severe
winter weather and statistical difficulties with the daily average
adjustment for December also may have combined to deepen the reported
decline.
On a quarterly basis, which suppresses some of the volatility,
starts in the fourth quarter were still above the improved third quarter
level, as shown in the table. The fourth quarter rise was concentrated
in multifamily structures and in the South and North Central states.
For the year 1967, starts totaled 1.29 million--a tenth above the 1966
total.

II -15
Barring abnormal weather interruptions, a return to a more
rapid rate of starts is indicated for January, and some further
improvement is possible for the first quarter as a whole. Supporting
this judgment, building permits declined much less than seasonally in
December and were appreciably above the fourth quarter average and the
highest since early 1964. Moreover, the December rise in permits was
widespread both by type of structure and by region.
While seasonally adjusted sales of new homes by speculative
builders declined in November, the rate was still one of the highest
in 1967; and, partly reflecting the policy of many builders to limit
construction to pre-sold units, seasonally adjusted stocks of new homes
for sale remained very near earlier reduced levels.
In markets for existing homes, the limited availability of
suitable properties and the higher discounts required in some areas
have tended to moderate sales activity, which normally is around
seasonal lows at this time. Even so, sales in both October and November
were more than a third above a year earlier, according to the National
Association of Real Estate Boards.
Retail sales. Sales in the first three weeks of January
suggest little change, or a further small decline, from the December
level.
In December the dollar value of retail sales was down
slightly from November and up less than 4 per cent from a year earlier,
according to the Census Bureau advance figures. Sales at durable
goods stores were up only moderately both from the preceding month and

II -16
from a year earlier. (See table.) At nondurable goods stores, sales
were off a little following a sharp rise in November but were up
moderately from a year earlier.
The December increase in sales at durable goods stores
reflected increases in automotive, furniture and appliance, and farm
equipment outlets. Declines were reported at all major nondurable
goods outlets except drug stores.
For the fourth quarter as a whole, retail sales were nearly
1 per cent below the third quarter as durable goods sales, particularly
strike-affected autos, dropped sharply while nondurable goods sales
rose slightly.

Unit auto sales and stocks. New car sales in January rose
less than most industry sources had anticipated. In the first 20 days,
dealer deliveries of domestic autos were at a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of 7.8 million units, about the same as a year earlier
when auto sales were declining and stocks were rising to very high
levels. Moreover, some producers already are beginning sales incentive
contests, although such contests usually do not become common until
spring.
Dealer stocks of new cars increased further in the first
20 days of January but in the last 10 days of the month work stoppages
at some G.M. plants may have slowed the rise in inventories. On
January 20, dealers had 1.3 million units on hand, a number which has
been surpassed this early in the year only in 1966 and 1967.
Sales of used cars in the first 20 days of January were at
the same rate as in December and also the same as a year earlier, when
used car sales were relatively low. Seasonally adjusted used car
prices (as reported in the CPI) eased slightly in December but were
nearly one-tenth higher than a year earlier.
Consumer credit. Consumers have stepped up their borrowing
in recent months, but net increases in instalment credit outstanding
have been small compared with other recent years. December apparently
will be the only month in 1967 in which the increase in outstandings
was larger than a year earlier. For 1967 as a whole, the rise in
instalment credit was about half that for 1966, as can be seen in the
table.

As usual, much of the slack in total consumer credit and
much of the unevenness in its growth pattern last year was traceable
to auto credit. New extensions of auto credit, which had flattened
out in 1966, dropped in early 1967 to their lowest level in more than
two years. While there was some pick-up as the year progressed, loan
volume generally continued below year-earlier levels.
Despite relatively sluggish credit extensions, there was a
considerable further rise in repayments on old auto debt last year.
The result was a marked narrowing of the gap between extensions and
repayments of auto debt. In 1965, net increases in outstanding auto
debt had averaged over $300 million per month. In 1966, the average
dropped to $175 million, and in 1967 to less than $30 million per month.
Auto extensions may rise at a faster pace this year--even
if unit sales do not increase as much as the industry expects--in view
of the rise in average size of instalment contracts. The average new-
car note has been running in the $2,800 -$2,900 range since the

II -19
higher-priced 1968 models went on sale last fall, more than $100 above
corresponding year-earlier levels, and it may have increased a little
further in January.
Labor market. Resurgence in industrial employment and the
continued rapid expansion in most nonmanufacturing sectors have com-
bined to strengthen the tone of the labor market. Further strong
demands for labor appear in prospect in coming months. High rates of
production to build inventories in autos and steel, and to meet
expanding equipment orders, as well as accelerated increases in personal
income with their expansive implications for consumer spending, all
suggest further large gains in employment.
Employment. Nonfarm employment increased by about 200,000
in December on top of a much larger November rise than was indicated
by the preliminary data. The pick-up in nonfarm payroll employment
from pre-auto strike August levels to December was 900,000--an annual
rate of growth of 2.7 million jobs.
This resurgence of employment growth was reflected in the
unemployment figures as well, with the rate dropping another two-
tenths in December to 3.7 per cent. The unemployment rate declined
appreciably among teenage workers in December and unemployment among
adult men (25 and over) was below 2 per cent, as low as any time in the
past two years.
The employment gains in November and December were broadly
based. Manufacturing employment increased by 80,000 in December (after

II -20
allowance for strikes), with new strength evident in the construction-
related lumber, furniture and stone, clay and glass industries. Trans-
portation equipment employment rose by 20,000 and was close to regaining
its pre-strike level, although G.M. and Chrysler were still subject to
intermittent strikes involving some 30,000 workers. Nondurable goods
industries also showed renewed growth, having risen by more than 60,000
in two months.
The December and revised November data also painted a much
stronger employment picture in construction. After months of no gains,
employment increased by 100,000 from October to December which brought
the level of construction employment back to its February 1967 high and
to within about one per cent of its early 1966 peak.
The December data also indicate continued rapid growth in
the trade-service-State and local government sector in the past few
months. In fact, the only sector experiencing significant employment
declines during the period was the Federal government, where the number
of workers dipped somewhat further in December for a net reduction of
65,000 since July.
The average workweek in manufacturing also has been edging
up since its mid-summer low of 40.3 hours, but at 40.8 hours in
December, was still three quarters of an hour below the early 1966
peak levels, leaving room for further increases in hours to meet expand-
ing manpower requirements.

II -21
Earnings. Average hourly earnings of production workers in
manufacturing rose three cents in December following a two-cent rise
in November and, at $2.90, were up 4.7 per cent over the year. This
was the largest over-the-year increase for any month in 1967, and
reflected in part the first impact of the large wage settlement in
autos. A further rise in January is in prospect as a result of the
G.M. settlement at the end of December. In addition, there were small
but widespread increases throughout durable goods industries; nondur-
able goods earnings also showed a sizable gain.
Industrial relations. Substantial upward wage adjustments
are in prospect in a wide range of industries in the next several
months. Wage reopenings and contract expirations will raise the wages
of about 1 million workers in the first quarter, largely in communica-
tions, construction, cans and glass containers.
Of particular interest are the current negotiations of the
steelworkers and the major can companies--whose contract expires
January 31--because of its implications for the upcoming aluminum
negotiations (May) and steel (July). Preliminary reports suggest that
the unions in the can and telephone industries are demanding wage and
fringe packages costing about 7 per cent a year; the auto settlement
of 6.0 -6.5 per cent appears to have established a floor for upcoming
negotiations. An additional 1-1/4 million workers will also receive
deferred increases of 4 -5 per cent in petroleum, trucking, retail
trade, hotels, apparel and on airlines in the first quarter. Wages of

II -22
a large number of low wage workers will also be raised early this year
as a result of the increase in the minimum wage of 15 to 20 cents an
hour, effective February 1.
Unit labor costs in manufacturing. Unit labor costs in
manufacturing dipped in December following three months of relative
stability and, at 106.7, the index was a tenth of a point below the
June figure. However, in addition to a pick-up in productivity, the
decline in unit labor costs in December was due to an unexplained lack
of growth in average hourly compensation--despite a large gain over
the month in hourly earnings--and may reflect in part seasonal adjust-
ment or other statistical problems.

The slowdown in growth of unit labor costs late in the year
was a result of the offsetting movements of productivity and compen-
sation per manhour. Output per manhour showed virtually no increase
in the first half of 1967, but picked-up late in the year with the

II -23
rise in output; productivity in manufacturing rose at an annual rate
of about 4 per cent from June to December. The increase in average
hourly compensation, on the other hand, apparently dipped from about
a 5-1/2 per cent annual rate in the second quarter of 1967 to a sur-
prisingly low 3 per cent in the fourth quarter.
However, with sizable wage adjustments in prospect, as well
as deferred wage increases and the rise in the minimum wage on
February 1, average hourly compensation should resume a sharp upward
course, at an annual rate of 6 per cent or more, in the coming months.
While productivity is also expected to increase, the rise is not likely
to be large enough to offset fully the effect of increasing compensation
on unit labor costs.

II -24
Wholesale prices. The BLS wholesale price index for industrial
commodities increased by u.3 per cent from mid-November to mid-December,
and, according to preliminary estimates, rose another 0.3 per cent in
mid-January. At an estimated 107.7 per cent of the 1957-59 average,
the BLS industrial average in mid-January was 1.6 per cent above mid-
July, representing an annual rate of rise of 3.2 per cent. From mid-1966
to mid-1967, this index had increased less than 1 per cent. Since
mid-January, price increases have been effected for a variety of
industrial materials and products, including copper scrap, special
tool steels, high-grade zinc, cotton cloth, appliances, color film, and
mining machinery.
In December, the earlier sharp decline in prices of
agricultural products was reversed abruptly, and the BLS index for
farm products and processed foods and feeds rose about 1.5 per cent.
This large increase combined with the continued sharp rise in the
industrial price average in December led to the largest monthly increase
(0.6 per cent) in the total wholesale price index since mid-1966. At
106.8, the WPI was back to the peak reached in September 1966, when
the sharp 1965-66 run-up in prices of foods and foodstuffs culminated.
Prices of farm products rose somewhat further in early January, and
the total wholesale index increased to an estimated 107.1, a new high.
In November and December, industrial prices increased somewhat
faster than they had from July to October. The speed-up was particularly
noticeable in the special Federal Reserve industrial price average, which
includes cotton as noted in the table below.

/ The BLS Industrial Commodity index increased at a rate of only 3.6 per
cent from October to December and 3.1 per cent from July to December.
The lower rate for the BLS index appears to be due entirely to the
classification by the BLS of cotton (and other natural fibers) as farm
products and not as industrial commodities as in the FR groupings.
A sharp run-up in the price of cotton--which carried over
into cotton cloth and house-furnishings--was a major factor in the
November-December rise. Another major influence was the marked
acceleration in the rise in prices of raw and semi-fabricated copper,
a rise which had been going on since the beginning of the copper
strike in mid-July. Of lesser significance was a step-up in price

II -26
increases for man-made fiber textile products, and a moderate upturn
in hides and leather following a decline of over a third from mid-1966
to October 1967. Altogether, prices of sensitive industrial materials
increased nearly 3 per cent from October to December (an annual rate
of 16.8 per cent), recovering, by December, three-fifths of the sharp
decline from mid-1966 to mid-1967.
Price increases for sluggish materials--which in aggregate
are nearly four times as important as sensitive materials in the
industrial commodity average--also speeded up in November and December.
During those two months steel mill products continued to rise at about
the July-October pact (an annual rate of 2.8 per cent) and industrial
chemicals showed no change following a sharp spurt in October. But
these and other basic material price increases--including sharply
higher copper prices--were being translated in November and December
into higher prices for more highly fabricated "materials" (hardware,
cans, brass fittings and various other parts and components for finished
consumer and producer goods).
Average prices of finished industrial products increased at
a slower pace in November and December than in the preceding three
months, but the slower pace stemmed in the main from the behavior
of motor vehicle prices. Between July and October (and mainly in
October) motor vehicle prices increased sharply, with the introduction
of 1968 models, and then they stabilized--at least temporarily. Rela-
tive stability in the rate of increase in average prices of all

II -27
industrial products except motor vehicles obscures the fact that in
recent months price increases have accelerated for machinery and equip-
ment while they have moderated, on average, for consumer products.
Since December, prices of raw and semi-fabricated--and
presumably also more highly fabricated--copper and products have
continued to advance. The strike, now in its 29th week has resulted
in the loss of nearly 1,000,000 tons of primary copper, and copper
fabricators are reportedly paying 67 cents a pound or more for the
limited supply of copper available on the open market (mostly sharply
expanded imports as compared with the 38 cents price for domestically
produced primary copper available before the strike. No end of the
strike now appears in sight but pressures for settlement are mounting.
Moreover, at present prices, efforts to substitute other materials
for copper are accelerating. With the end of the strike, of course,
the average price of primary copper will gradually subside--perhaps
to 40 or 42 cents a pound for new domestic supplies.
The price of raw cotton, on the other hand, has receded
somewhat in recent weeks. The earlier sharp run-up--while induced
basically by the very short crop and limited supplies of long-staples--
had a speculative element in it and the supply of long-staple cotton
is proving to be somewhat larger than anticipated. Moreover, domestic
mills are apparently shifting more to short-staple from long-staple
cotton, where the price rise was most pronounced; and sharply higher
prices--coupled with a continuing lag in foreign textile demands--is
leading to a reduction in U.S. exports.

II -28
Tapering off of price increases for copper and cotton and
their products would act to moderate the over-all increase in industrial
prices, and the unusually sharp rate of increase in November and
December was probably temporarily high.
Consumer prices. The BLS consumer price index increased another
0.3 per cent in December, to 118.2 per cent of the 1957-59 average--3.1
per cent above the level of a year earlier.
Reversing the moderate, seasonal decline of the preceding
3 months, grocery prices as well as the total food index increased 0.5
per cent (more than seasonally), largely as a result of increases for
fresh vegetables, eggs, and processed fruits. Prices of restaurant
meals--with their large wage component--continued their steady upward
trend and were 4.8 per cent above a year earlier. Grocery prices in
December were up only 0.3 per cent over the year.
Average prices of all commodities other than food were
unchanged from November to December--following earlier sharp increases.
Apparel prices were up somewhat further, although seasonally they are
expected to edge down a bit. Gasoline prices declined as "price wars"
were resumed in Los Angeles and Kansas City. New car prices decreased
0.1 per cent, substantially less than expected seasonally, but used
cars declined more than seasonally as used car inventories reportedly
increased.
Prices of consumer services, less rent, rose 0.4 per cent
in December as medical care continued its sharp upward trend and home

II -29
maintenance, mortgage interest, property taxes, and insurance also rose.
Rents were up 0.3 per cent in December and 2.0 per cent for the year,
the largest yearly increase since 1956. Over the course of 1967, the
rise in service prices accelerated, reaching an annual rate of 4-1/2
per cent in the last 4 months. This was considerably above the rate
in early 1967 but still below the rate prevailing during most of 1966.

As indicated in the second table, receipts rise by $6.2
billion in fiscal year 1968 and by $22.3 billion in fiscal year 1969.
These include the effect of 10 per cent tax surcharge recommended for
individuals, beginning April 1, 1968, and for corporations retroactive
to January 1, 1968. Also a further acceleration of corporate income
tax payments is requested. These legislative changes account for
$2.7 billion of the Increase in receipts in fiscal year 1968 and $10.2
billion in fiscal year 1969. In addition to these higher rates of
taxation, the President is requesting a continuation of the present
excise tax rates on automobiles and telephone service.

by $0.3 billion in FY 1968, and $2.7 billion in FY 1969. Figures
allow for existing legislation and the increases in the employment
tax yield in FY 1969. The ceiling on taxable earnings was raised
in January 1968 and the tax rate is scheduled to increase in
January 1969. These legislative changes increase fiscal 1968
revenues by $0.1 billion and fiscal 1969 revenues by about $3.2
billion.
1968 and an increase in corporate profits from $80.1 billion in
calender 1967 to $87 billion in calendar 1968.
On the spending side, total Federal outlays are expected to
rise by $17.2 billion in fiscal 1968 and $10.4 billion in fiscal 1969.
Net lending--which is a component of total outlays--declines by $2.5
billion in fiscal 1969, mainly reflecting a $1.9 billion decline in
mortgage acquisitions.

III -3
FNMA is expected to reduce its mortgage market support
purchases quite sharply in line with proposed legislation to lift the
ceiling on interest rates on Government-insured and guaranteed mortgages,
and thus to attract a larger private supply of mortgage money. In
addition, however, legislation is proposed which will accelerate the
transfer of FNMA secondary market operations to private ownership.
Such a transfer would, eventually allow complete exclusion of FNMA from
the Federal budget in the same way in which the Federal home loan
banks and Federal land banks are presently excluded from the new unified
budget. Once excluded, FNMA would "not be subject to the constraints of
the Federal budget and can raise money in the private capital market
to meet mortgage purchase needs.1/

III -4
Expenditures other than net lending increase by $16.6 billion
in fiscal year 1968 and $12.9 billion in 1969. All major categories
of expenditures show smaller increases in 1969 than in 1968, except
the social insurance trust funds and expenditures (other than net
lending) for housing and community development. Spending in the
latter category increases from $0.7 billion to $1.4 billion mainly due
to higher expenditures for model cities and urban renewal programs.
In summary, the new unified budget shows a deficit of $19.8
billion in fiscal year 1968 and $8.0 in fiscal year 1969. Allowing
for some changes in cash balances and other such items, borrowing from
the public is projected at $20.8 and $8.0 billion, respectively. These
new borrowing figures include sales of participation certificates to
the public, but they exclude the net borrowing by Federal home loan
banks and Federal land banks. To allow for the projected net borrowing
by these agencies, $1.6 billion needs to be added in the current fiscal
year and $2.9 billion in fiscal 1969.
Considering that the Federal Government and government-sponsored
agencies have borrowed a total of $20.4 billion in the period from
July to December 1967, the remaining total net borrowing needs for
January to June 1968 amount to $2.0 billion. Usually, the Government
makes net repayments of funds in the first half of the calendar year
and, thus, these borrowing requirements represent about $7-1/2
billion on a seasonally adjusted basis. Borrowing requirements would
be greater by abcut $2.7 billion if the recommended tax legislation
is delayed.

$11.3 billion in the fourth quarter of 1967 to $13 billion in the
second quarter of 1968. If the surcharges were enacted, however,
the seasonally-adjusted deficit would amount to about $3-1/2 billion
at an annual rate in the second quarter of 1968.

U.S. Government securities market. Yields on intermediate
and long-term Treasury obligations declined sharply during the first
two weeks of January, but subsequent increases have erased part of
these declines. Currently, these yields remain well below their 1967
highs established around mid-November. Most Treasury bill rates have
also fallen substantially in January, most notably on the longer
maturities as the table shows.

The sizable rally in the Treasury bond prices during the first
two weeks of January, which was triggered by announcement of the new
balance of payments program and by rumors of possible peace negotia-
tions in Vietnam, ran its course by mid-month. Even so, the market
appeared to retain an underlying firmness, as it subsequently

III -8
weathered--with relatively modest upward yield adjustments--a number
of adverse developments, including deferral by Congress for later
consideration of the President's tax increase proposal and increased
tension in the Far East. Contributing to this market performance was
a spreading conviction that monetary policy was not likely to tighten
further in coming weeks during which the Treasury would be engaged
in sizable financing operations. In addition, System purchases of
coupon issues at mid-month, totaling $78 million, helped to reduce
dealer inventories to relatively low levels, and subsequently a modest
volume of net investor demand met with apparent dealer reluctance to
reduce their positions further. In late January, dealers as a group
had net short positions of about $40 million in bonds due after 5
years and net long positions of around $90 million in 1-5 year issues.
The decline in bill rates during January occurred against
a background of reportedly good investor demand for all types of
short-term market instruments and despite the auction by the Treasury
of $2.5 billion of additional June tax bills on January 9. Dealers,
continuing to find a ready availability of financing, tended to resist
a decline in their inventories by bidding aggressively for new bills
in the auctions and at times for outstanding bills in the market. As
has been true in other recent years, the System was not a very
important factor in the dealer market during January. The reserve
requirement increase effective around mid-month led, however, to a
reduced need to absorb reserves through open market operations.
Yields also declined substantially in January on short-term
market instruments other than bills, as the following table indicates:

Treasury finance. The Treasury will announce on January 31
the terms of its February refunding involving a relatively small $1.7
billion of publicly-held maturing securities. Within the next
several weeks, the Treasury will also need to raise a sizable amount
of new cash, possibly as much as $4 billion or so. Some market
observers expect that a portion of this cash will be raised in
conjunction with the February refunding and the balance in March.

III -11
Bank credit. Commercial bank credit expanded at a fairly
rapid pace in January, following a marked slackening in late 1967.
The bank credit proxy, on a daily average basis, is projected to in-
crease at about a 9 per cent annual rate over the month, compared
with a 4 per cent average in November and December. A substantial
part of the advance was associated with loan expansion early in the
month, but the Treasury cash financing at mid-month and increased
availability of CD funds also were contributory factors.

Business loans 9.3 10.9 5.1 11.4 8.4
As measured by the end-of-month series, preliminary estimates
indicate that total credit may have increased at an 11 per cent annual
rate in January. Notwithstanding the $2.5 billion tax bill financing
at mid-month with full Tax and Loan Account credit privilege, bank
holdings of U.S. Government securities are expected to show a decline
for the month. With investor demand for these securities unusually
strong, city banks reduced their holdings of Governments more than

III -12
seasonally prior to the financing, and in the week following, they
made large further reductions--nearly as large as their net acquisitions
in the financing week.
On the other hand, holdings of other securities are expected
to decline much less than seasonally in January. Although city banks
made sizable reductions in their holdings of short-term municipals,
these were offset in part by increased acquisitions of longer-term
municipals, agency issues, and participation certificates. There are
reports that some banks have decided to make 1968 a loss year on
securities transactions and have already engaged in a limited amount
of portfolio lengthening, thus providing a base for realization of
capital gains in future years.
A major part of the loan expansion in January was in business
loans, which continued to rise at a rapid pace in early January
following a marked pickup in mid-December associated mainly with tax
and dividend payments and year-end adjustments. After mid-January,
however, the uptrend tapered off, allowing for usual seasonal changes,
and in the week ending January 24, business loans declined much more
than in the comparable week of any recent year. For the month as a
whole, it now appears that the seasonally adjusted increase might amount
to about half the large December rise, or little more than the low
average monthly rise over the last half of 1967.
Much of the January increase appears to have represented a
continuation into early January of heavy year-end borrowing, which
occasionally occurrs in certain industry groups, such as mining,

III -13
petroleum and chemicals and public utilities. There is no clear
indication as yet of stepped-up inventory borrowing by the metals-
using industries.
Real estate and consumer loans appear to have expanded
further in January at the somewhat faster pace that prevailed over
the last quarter of 1967. Dealers in U.S. Government securities
increased their borrowings sharply in early January as they expanded
their trading positions to take advantage of the improving demand and
rising prices of these issues, but they reduced positions and paid off
a large part of these borrowings later in the month. Broker-dealer
loans secured by other than Governments declined more than usual in
January, presumably reflecting a reduction in inventories in response
to strong investor demand.
Bank deposits. With large amounts of funds seeking in-
vestment and market yields declining from their December peaks, inflows
of time and savings deposits at commercial banks resumed an upward
trend in January after declining in the last half of December. On a
monthly average basis, these deposits are expected to show little
change from the December level, but from the end of December to the
end of January, they are projected to increase at about a 5 per cent
annual rate--quite moderate compared to earlier experience.
The major factor in the turnaround was the sizable recovery
in negotiable CD's in January after a large decline in the last half
of December. In the three weeks ending January 24, outstanding CD's

III -14
rose $800 million, offsetting about four-fifths of the previous run-
off. Nearly all the January inflow was in IPC deposits at banks
outside New York City. In view of the January decline in short-term
yields generally, some prime banks reduced their offering rates on
the shortest maturities of CD's to around 4-3/4 per cent near the end
of the month, and they were able to attract funds in the 5-6 month
maturity range or longer at the 5-1/2 per cent ceiling.
Along with easing in our money markets, rates on Euro-dollar
deposits declined substantially in early January from their relatively
high levels in late December. As a result, banks moved promptly to
recover their year-end losses of these deposits. By late January,
liabilities of U.S. banks to foreign branches were above the December high.

Meanwhile, inflows of time and savings deposits other than
CD's appear to have declined further in January from their reduced
December pace. While many commercial banks had expected substantial
deposit attrition immediately following December interest crediting,
outflows, by and large, did not materialize in the volume feared.
Regular savings deposits, which had shown little growth in late 1967,
declined in early January, but part of this decline apparently
represented transfers into savings certificates and new consumer-type
open account deposits. Increased bank advertising for consumer-type
deposits in January no doubt contributed to the generally satisfactory
behavior of these deposits over the month
The money stock, which had been drifting downward since early
November, rose sharply in late December and early January, but in late
January, it declined from its mid-month peak. Although the daily
average for January is projected to rise at a 10-1/2 per cent annual
rate, the level in late January is expected to show little change from
that in late December. Most of the earlier increase appears to have
been associated with the sharp rise in business and security loans in
late December and early January. The public's sluggish readjustment
of cash balances following the recent surge may have been due in
part to increased uncertainty generated by the balance of payments
program, peace talk, and a number of other unanticipated developments.

III -16
Nonbank depositary institutions. Preliminary data suggest
that inflows to mutual savings banks and savings and loan associations
moderated further in December and January from the already reduced
pace earlier last fall. Although both institutions experienced this
slowdown in net inflows, in December the deceleration at mutual
savings banks was relatively larger than at savings and loans. The
December experience at mutuals was apparently a reflection of large
withdrawals during the 3-day grace period at the end of December at
New York City savings banks, which are thought to have particularly
interest-sensitive depositors. The difficulty that such institutions
have in holding deposits during a period of relatively high market
rates is compounded by the fact that mutuals, unlike savings and loans,
are prevented from offering special accounts above the current passbook
ceiling of 5 per cent.

During the critical December-January reinvestment period,
preliminary data suggest that at both institutions net withdrawals
were not as large as during the similar 1965-66 period. Consequently,
on the basis of this fragmentary evidence and impressions from in-
dustry sources, the staff is estimating that both institutions may
have done somewhat better for the full month of January this year than
in January 1966--the first month of sharply reduced inflows in 1966.
Undoubtedly, most of the reduced inflows since the fall have
reflected the attraction of market instruments--especially Treasury
securities. Moreover, underwriters have recently reported an increase
in the number of relatively small orders for corporate bonds. But,
despite the somewhat larger public purchases of market securities,
several factors probably account for a reinvestment period experience
better than many observers had expected in light of the level of market
yields. Probably the most important factor accounting for the relative
strength of net inflows was the existence of rate ceilings that limited
the ability of commercial banks to attract funds from nonbank insti-
tutions. Staff studies suggest that nonbank institution claims are
particularly sensitive to rates paid on consumer-type timecertificates at
commercial banks. With the latter rates now constrained by regulation,
only limited incentive exists to make shifts from nonbank to bank
1/claims. In addition, as suggested by a recent study of the FHLBB-,
1/ Federal Home Loan Bank Board "Dividend Rates and the Structure of
Savings Accounts--member S&L Associations, July 1967". The principal
results of this survey were that in July, average offering rates
declined, primarily as a result of rate ceiling reductions in 10
States; that non-rate terms on special accounts became somewhat less
liberal; and that growth in special accounts during the first half
of 1967 accounted for three-fourths of total growth in savings
capital at S&Ls.

III -18
minimum-term accounts--available at yields above the passbook rate--
have become an increasingly important source of nonbank funds.
Finally, although it cannot be demonstrated empirically, it is
likely that some of the more sophisticated depositors removing
balances in 1966 did not return to nonbank institutions in 1967,
instead acquiring other financial assets such as equities and longer-
term debt instruments.
With net inflows moderating in the fourth quarter, and with
previously made mortgage commitments maturing, mutual savings banks
sharply reduced their acquisitions of corporate bonds from the un-
precedented high level of the first nine months of the year. At
savings and loan associations, the slower growth in share capital in
the fourth quarter was primarily reflected in the ending of loan
repayments to the FHLBB and a quite large increase in "other borrowings"--
mainly short-term bank loans. Most of this latter borrowing was made
in December and probably reflects their preparation for potential
withdrawals; currently, savings and loan associations are discouraged
from borrowing from the FHLBB in anticipation of withdrawals. In
addition to adjusting their liability structure, there was a slowdown
in the growth of outstanding mortgage commitments by savings and loan
associations in the fourth quarter.
Mortgage market developments. While flows to depositary
institutions in the recent reinvestment period seem to have been
stronger than lenders generally had expected, growth in mortgage commit-
ments outstanding was moderated in December. Moreover, yields on

III -19
home-mortgages were raised further, for both conventional and FHA-
insured mortgages, as shown in the table.

NOTE: FHA series; interest rates on conventional first mortgages (ex-

The further increases in December carried mortgage yields back
to their peaks in November 1966 and were associated with a return of
average discounts required by lenders to a record 6.8 points in the case
of the FHA-yield series and with upward adjustment in discounts for
conventional loans in states with low usury ceilings as well. Even so,
the gross yield spread between FHA-insured mortgages and new corporate
bonds remained unusually narrow, at about 30 basis points. And although
further improvement in the yield-spread was indicated in January as
bond yields receded, the possibility of some additional upward adjustment
in mortgage yields and related discounts over the period ahead can
not be ruled out.

III -20
The return to record yield requirements by lenders in
December was apparently accompanied, however, by somewhat more
liberal terms for qualified borrowers. In the case of conventional
loans for new homes, average maturities were lengthened a half-year to
24.8 years with some increase also for comparable loans for existing
homes, to 21.7 years, according to the Federal Home Loan Bank Board.
Also, although loan-to-price ratios changed little, average prices of
homes involved in transactions generally tended higher and loan amounts
remained at or above already advanced levels.
Reflecting the substantial momentum regained by real estate
markets in 1967, the volume of mortgage debt outstanding continued upward
contraseasonally in the fourth quarter to a year-end level currently
estimated at $369 billion, as shown in the table. The fourth-quarter
increases for some of the lender groups with the broadest investment
options--notably.the mutual savings banks and life insurance companies--
apparently fell far short of net acquisitions in comparable periods of
most other recent years. However, the increase for the dominant savings
and loan associations was one of the largest on record. And exceptionally
large support from the Federal National Mortgage Association--only
slightly less than in the first quarter of 1966--helped raise the net
increase for all holders to about the levels prevailing in 1964 and
1965.

For 1967 as a whole, the net increase in total mortgage debt
is estimated at $22.0 billion. This compares with $20.6 billion in
1966, and with a record $26.2 billion in 1965.
While the net increase in mortgage debt on 1- to 4-family pro-
perties averaged only about $12 billion, it accounted for more than
half of the total increase. Moreover, once started, 1- to 4-family
mortgage debt moved persistently upward through the year, as shown in
the table on a seasonally adjusted basis. In fact, by the fourth
quarter, the annual rate of net increase in such debt had apparently
returned to the $15-$16 billion range which had prevailed in 1963-65.
Debt increases for income properties were also back to relatively high
rates by the fourth quarter.I

Corporate and municipal bond markets. For the past several
weeks, yields on corporate and municipal bonds have declined substan-
tially from their highs reached early in December. In the last week
of January, however, the yield decline moderated and, in some cases,
yields edged up. In the corporate market, particularly, investor
response accorded new issues at the reduced yield levels of early and
mid-January lacked enthusiasm. This is partly reflected by the three
utility issues that--in the latter part of the month--were released
from underwriters' syndicate restrictions with subsequent upward
yield adjustments ranging from 9 to 14 basis points.

Several factors seem to have played a role in the sharp
yield decline and subsequent upward tendencies evident in the new issue
market. The yield decline coincided with.the typical year-end abate-
ment of new issue activity and the usual greater fund availability
at major institutional investors during the turn-of-the-year period.
These purely seasonal factors were probably augmented by the growing
belief among market participants that the level of yields prevailing in
early December were unlikely to be exceeded, as impressions strengthened
that new issue demand in the public markets would be reduced from the
record set in 1967. But aggressive bidding by underwriters on an

III -24
increasing number of new utility issues subsequently met with signifi-
cant investor resistance and resulted in a rising inventory of unsold
bonds.
Despite the buildup in new issues as the month progressed,
the volume of publicly-offered corporate bonds in January, which is
expected to total about $900 million, is significantly below the
nearly $1.3 billion monthly average for such issues during 1967. This
volume is still unusually large, however, and in fact is a record for
any January. With privately placed bonds estimated at $700 million
for January, total bonds and stock offerings are estimated to aggregate
about $1.8 billion, somewhat above that registered in January 1967.
The recent pickup in privately placed issues reflects the increase
throughout last year in life insurance company commitments for later
takedown.
Looking ahead, the forward calendar of scheduled public bond
offerings has not appreciably built up in recent weeks, and the February
volume now scheduled totals only about $600 million. While further
additions to the calendar are anticipated, the ultimate volume may
not be more than $850 million. This would place February offerings
below January as well as below the corresponding month a year earlier.
This relative drop-off in expected volume is principally accounted for
by the decline in announcements of new industrial offerings, noted in
the last Greenbook. The February calendar to date consists largely
of utility bond issues.

III -25
Total bond financing will most likely not show the decline in
February, however, as private placements expand reflecting takedown
from previously made commitments with institutional investors.

In the municipal market, the January volume of new bond
offerings again exceeded the $1 billion mark and approximated the $1.2
billion monthly average for such issues over the past year. The
strength of bank demand for municipals was apparently an important
factor in the absorption of this volume of issues at declining yields.
This is particularly the case for the two outsized issues which
dominated the January calendar--the State of California ($100 million)
and New York City ($114 million) bond offerings. In both cases,
commercial banks associated with the underwriting of these issues
reportedly took sizable amounts for their own portfolios.

The volume of new municipal bond issues estimated for
February--at $1.1 billion--will be only slightly below January. It
should be noted that this estimate does not allow for any substantial
bulge in industrial revenue offerings, which in part accounted for the
increased total volume of municipal issues late last year. Current
prospects for passage of prohibitive legislation dealing with indus-
trial bonds appear remote in this session of Congress but the Treasury's
proposal to make such legislation retroactive to December 31, 1967
should tend to restrain more issues of such bonds. Any change in
legislative proposals might again lead to a rush of issuers to market
their bonds before such legislation becomes effective.
Stock market. After fluctuating around a relatively flat
trend throughout the first half of December, equity prices--as indicated
by the broadly based Standard & Poor's composite index--advanced 2.2
per cent between mid-December and mid-January. During the latter half

III -27
of January, however, the composite index showed a rather sharp decline
that more than erased this most recent advance. As indicated in the
table, the decline began earliest and was sharpest among the higher
quality issues--as reflected in the Dow-Jones Industrial average--but
was subsequently reinforced by an abrupt retreat of lower quality
issues.

The continued acceleration in the volume of stock market
trading-- and its attendant back-office bottlenecks--led officials
of the major exchanges to shorten trading hours by 90 minutes,
effective January 22 and to continue for the indefinite future. While
this action succeeded in reducing volume from the record highs reached
earlier in January, with continued interest in equities, trading volume
during the first week of the new regulation still remained larger than
the exceptionally high volume of last fall--particularly on the
American Exchange, where volume has increased relatively more rapidly
than on the New York Exchange.

At the same time that trading hours were shortened, officials of the
American Exchange--where stock price growth has been about three times
as great, since the October 1966 low, as that of NYSE stock prices--
admonished member firms to discourage speculative trading by their
customers. Along with the New York Stock Exchange, they also in-
creased further to record levels the number of issues on which 100
per cent margin requirements were imposed. The publicity of all
these actions might have contributed to recent declines in stock prices,
but general uncertainties regarding public policies and international
developments may also have been important factors.

Stock market credit increased $242 million to a record high
of $8,774 million in December. While bank loans to non-brokers rose
only $22 million, the margin debt component increased $220 million--
the largest monthly increase since September. The distribution of
accounts by equity status, however, was little changed during the
month, with the proportion with equity under 40 per cent remaining
about 10 per cent of the total. During the month, customers net
free credit balances rose by $263 million to $2,763 million.
1/ Customers' net debit balances rose by considerably more, but only
because of an increase in float resulting from significantly in-
creased trading volume and the slow holiday mail deliveries.

U.S. balance of payments. The liquidity deficit in the fourth
quarter of last year was about $1.9 billion, seasonally adjusted, slightly
less than the earlier estimate. For the year the deficit was $3.6 billion.
When adjusted to eliminate special receipts (or, in the fourth quarter,
special payments because of the liquidation of the U.K. Government's
investment portfolio) these figures become $1.5 billion for the quarter
and $4.6 billion for the year. The latter compares with $2.9 billion in
1966.

It is now clear that a large part of the deterioration in the
liquidity deficit from the third to the fourth quarters -- about $750 million

IV -2
apart from special transactions -- was connected with a drop of about that
amount in the merchandise trade surplus. This ominous weakening in the
trade accounts is discussed below. Preliminary data on banking claims on
foreigners show a sizable increase in December. However, after seasonal
adjustments (which may now require some correction because of the dis-
tortions brought by the voluntary programs) there was an inflow of bank-
reported claims of $100 million in the fourth quarter, whereas in the
third quarter there was a seasonally adjusted outflow of $400 million.
There are major elements of the fourth quarter balance of
payments that are still unknown -- in particular there will be no infor-
mation for some time on direct-investment capital flows or income receipts.
Nevertheless, given the data on trade and banking claims, it now seems
less likely that speculative or other increased outflows of private
capital were a large factor in the worsening of the fourth quarter
balance. For the year as a whole, however, the total of net unrecorded
payments -- changes in which may be a crude indicator of changes in
speculative flows -- was probably over $1 billion, compared to an
unusually low $300 million in 1966.
Weekly figures for January show a continuation of liquidity
deficits, but they are too incomplete and imprecise to permit an evalu-
ation of their significance at this time.
Measured on the official settlements basis, the deficit in the
fourth quarter (S.A.) and for the year 1967 were $1.2 billion and $3.4
billion, respectively, about the same as estimated a month ago. Both
figures were raised by the final sell-off of U.K. government assets, and
would have been $.7 billion and $2.9 billion without such sales.

IV -3
The large official settlements deficit last year was in striking
contrast to the surplus of $225 million registered in 1966 or the $875 mil-
lion average deficit of 1964-66. A major change from 1966 was in the rate
of increase in short-term liabilities to foreign commercial banks. These
liabilities -- which include amounts due to foreign branches of U.S. banks --
rose by a phenomenal $2.7 billion in 1966, but in 1967 the increase was
much lower at an estimated $1.3 billion. However, the latter amount was
still far above the average increase for years before 1966.
Holdings of liquid dollar claims against the U.S. by foreign
official accounts increased markedly in 1967; such claims had been reduced
by $1.6 billion in 1966 but expanded by $2.1 billion in 1967. During 1967
there was a notable $1.6 billion increase in liabilities under U.S.-in-
itiated swaps, compared to a minor increase in 1966.

In the early weeks of January the official settlements balance
has shown surpluses largely as a counterpart to increases in liabilities
to foreign branches of U.S. banks, and also because of sizable increases
in accounts of the U.S. agencies of Canadian banks. See page IV-15
below regarding recent Canadian developments.
U.S. foreign trade: In December 1967, the U.S. foreign trade
surplus virtually disappeared (balance of payments basis) with exports
and imports about equal. Imports spurted to a new high, exceeding the
record November total by about 6 per cent. Exports fell back from a
relatively high November value to about the third quarter rate. For the
entire fourth quarter the trade surplus was at an annual rate of $1.5
billion, approximately one-third of the second and third quarter rates,
and was the lowest since the fourth quarter of 1959. The surplus in
calendar 1967 was a disappointing $3.6 billion, slightly less than in
1966.

The decline in the fourth quarter surplus stems principally
from the sharp advance in imports. In the fourth quarter of 1967 imports
were at an annual rate of $28.5 billion, 9 per cent higher than in the
third quarter and about 7 per cent greater than the previous record highs
in the fall and winter quarters of 1966-67. The ratio of imports to GNP
which had declined somewhat in the preceding two quarters, was also up
sharply in the fourth quarter, equaling the previous peak ratio in the
third quarter of 1966.
About one-quarter of the increase in imports from the third to
the fourth quarter was connected with actual or anticipated domestic
strikes in copper and steel, together with larger imports of cars from
Canada, probably related to the Ford strike. Also arrivals of petroleum
which had been subnormal in the third quarter as the world pattern of
petroleum distribution was disrupted by the Middle East war, returned
to nearly normal rates in the fourth quarter, with December imports
particularly heavy. Crude oil imports for the year 1967, however, fell
about $100 million below quota allowances.
The copper strike is now adversely affecting our trade balance
by $50 million a month. Imports of refined copper in the fourth quarter
totaled nearly $600 million at an annual rate, compared with normal
yearly requirements of less than $200 million. The strike has also
resulted in reduced exports of refined copper, since domestic refineries
have been closed.
Iron and steel were also imported in record amounts during the
fourth quarter, partly in response to greater domestic use, but also in
anticipation of a steel strike this summer.

IV -6
Cars from Canada arrived in heavy volume in the fourth quarter
as Ford plants here and in Canada attempted to recover some of the pro-
duction lost during the recent strike. For the year 1967, imports of
automotive vehicles from Canada were valued at $1.6 billion, compared
with less than $1 billion in 1966 and $250 million in 1965 when the
U.S.-Canadian automotive agreement was initiated. Shipments of cars to
Canada also increased in 1967, but at a much slower pace. Consequently
the export surplus in such trade shrank to about $100 million last year
from about $500 and $300 million in 1965 and 1966, respectively.
Imports of cars from sources other than Canada were also greater
in the fourth quarter. Sales of these cars accounted for about 11 per cent
of total domestic sales in the last half of 1967, a sharp increase from the
8.5 per cent in the first half and the 7.5 per cent in calendar 1966. It
appears that some of these imports in the closing months of 1967 were to
replenish stocks heavily drawn down last spring and summer.
Other increases in fourth-quarter imports appear to be primarily
related to the further strengthening in domestic economic activity. Build-
ing materials, textiles and metals other than steel and copper were imported
in increased quantitites. In total, imports of industrial materials (in-
cluding fuels) were about 12.5 per cent of final sales of goods (GNP less
services and changes in inventories) in the fourth quarter, the greatest
proportion since the third quarter of 1966.
Arrivals of consumer goods other than autos, which had slowed
down in the middle quarters of 1967, again resumed their long-run upward
trend, and increased slightly their share of total consumer expenditures
on goods.

Exports in the fourth quarter were at an annual rate of $30.0
billion (balance of payments basis) about 2 per cent below the third-quarter
rate. Shipments of nonagricultural products were unchanged but those of
agricultural commodities, already below 1966 levels in the first three
quarters of 1967, fell further. By area, exports to Canada increased
sharply but these were more than offset by declines in shipments to Latin
America, Japan and other Asian countries. Exports to Western Europe held
at the third quarter rate.
For the year as a whole, exports were about 5 per cent greater
than in 1966. Exports of chemicals, machinery (mainly computers and

IV -8
telecommunication and other electrical apparatus), civilian aircraft and
automotive vehicles to Canada were particularly strong in 1967.
The U.S. share of world trade in manufactured products showed
a slight improvement in the first three quarters of 1967, when the United
States accounted for about 20.5 per cent of total world exports of such
goods, compared with 20.2 per cent in 1966. The share of the second
ranking exporter, Germany, remained about the same, at 19.5 per cent.
High levels of Canadian and Japanese imports, in which the United States
has a large share, and low levels of imports in some European countries
contributed to this result.

IV -9
Interest rates and monetary conditions abroad. Money market
conditions have been very easy during January in Germany and Switzerland.
Although rates in the London money market have been steady at a high level
ever since the British Bank rate increase at the time of devaluation, the
forward exchange discount on sterling is wide and covered yields available
to dollar holders moving into local authority deposits are much lower. Given
these conditions in the European markets, and given also the general stability
of U.S. money market rates during January, it is perhaps not surprising that
Euro-dollar rates have fallen off sharply from their abnormally high December
levels. Further discussion will be found at page IV-12. This week
(January 29-31) the 3-month Euro-dollar rate has gone below 5-1/2 per cent
for the first time since last September.

In Germany, the December tightening of the money market was much less
noticeable than in other years, and by mid-January interest rates on interbank
loans were at their lowest levels since early 1963. Call money stood at 1.50

IV -10
per cent on January 19 and 90-day loans at 3.00 per cent. Technical factors
caused rates to be temporarily higher on January 26.
The Bundesbank has encouraged the easing of rates by curtailing
the banks' short-term investment opportunities in two ways. Since early
January it has withheld from sale domestic Treasury bills, which ordinarily
it stands ready to sell to banks at posted rates. And it has not offered
the banks preferential rates of forward cover on short-term Euro-dollar in-
vestments, as it did in late November and December.
Nevertheless, in the first half of January the German commercial
banks' net assets abroad increased by $800 million, almost twice the December
decline. Much of the outflow was in DM-denominated call loans. Directly
and indirectly this addition to supplies in international money markets
contributed to the easing in Euro-dollar rates. With the 3-month forward
premium on the DM at more than 2-3/4 per cent in mid-January and still at
about 2-1/4 per cent this week, the covered return to German banks for
3-month Euro-dollars has been quite closely in line with the domestic 3-month
interbank rate.
The Bundesbank has been concerned by the fact that interest rates
at the long-term end of the market have not declined appreciably further
since the spring of 1967, but have remained in the 6-1/2 to 7 per cent range.
A major part of the domestic bonds issued in Germany in 1967 was taken by
the banks, and the Bundesbank is evidently encouraging bank purchases by
keeping short-term money easy.
During the first half of January the government successfully placed
DM 300 million of medium-term notes in the market, and another tranche of the
same size has just been offered.

IV -11
The cyclical upswing in German economic activity, which started
about the middle of last year, appears to be picking up steam. New domestic
orders to industry have risen uninterruptedly since the spring of 1967, and
by November they were running 20 per cent above the January 1967 low. In-
dustrial production in November was 6 per cent above the average for the
first half of 1967. Import figures give further evidence of the rise in
domestic demand; imports in October-November averaged 6-1/2 per cent higher
than in the second quarter. Demand was particularly pronounced for raw
materials and semi-finished goods. The growth in these categories of imports
and the improvement in domestic new orders for intermediate goods suggests
that German businesses were already beginning to rebuild depleted inventories.
In Britain, the increase in Bank Rate from 6-1/2 per cent to 8 per
cent at the time of devaluation (November 18) was followed immediately by
advances of 1 to 1-1/2 percentage points in short-term money market yields.
Since then these rates have been fairly stable.

There is little evidence, direct or indirect, of any substantial
net movements of short-term funds either into or out of sterling balances and

IV -12
short-term investments since mid-December. Large forward discounts on
sterling reflected lack of market confidence in the new parity of the
pound -- and also the absence of official intervention in the forward market.
For banks in London switches of covered investments into sterling were thus
unattractive. Meanwhile exchange controls prevented any substantial covered
switching in the other direction. Nor does there seem to have been any
further flight from sterling. There appears to have been substantial liqui-
dation of outstanding forward exchange contracts in the latter half of
January.
The cutbacks in planned spending of the government announced on
January 16 (see page IV-17 below and Appendix C) were viewed in the financial
community as less deflationary than had been anticipated, and perhaps in-
adequate. At any rate, stock prices rose and bond prices declined. Long-
term bond yields on January 19 and January 26 were close to mid-December
high levels -- at 7.20 per cent in the case of 3-1/2 per cent War Loan. In
the exchange market, however, spot sterling has held close to $2.41.
Euro-dollar interest rates this week have been lower than at any
time since the end of September. The decline from mid-December has been
much more than seasonal, and in that respect it has resembled the decline
at the same time of year in 1966-67. However, a year ago the rate movement
was part of a general reaction away from tight money conditions in all three
of the principal centers -- in the United States, Britain, and Germany. This
year, Euro-dollar rates in late November and December were abnormally high as
a result of market uncertainties following the devaluation of sterling. The
President's January 1 program may have caused increased willingness abroad

IV -13
to hold dollars and decreased desires to borrow dollars. The spillover
of liquidity from the German money market into international markets was
probably a major factor pushing rates down.
In December Euro-dollar rates were much above the general level
maintained from June through October. They were also high in relation to
U.S. rates on CD's. The liabilities of U.S. banks to their branches abroad
declined from mid-December to the end of the year, and then increased about
as much in the first three and a half weeks of March. (Recovery in January
to mid-December levels has been the usual seasonal pattern in other recent
years -- except in 1967, when U.S. banks' demand for Euro-dollars was di-
minishing.) Since January 10 there has been no appreciable further increase
in liabilities of New York banks to their branches abroad, but a substantial
increase outside New York. The further decline in Euro-dollar rates during
this period has accompanied an easing of CD rates in this country.

In contrast to developments in Germany and Switzerland, the French
money market has tightened this month. The call money rate, which stayed
in a range of 4-1/4 to 4-3/4 per cent during the second half of 1967, averaged

IV -14
about 5 per cent in the first three weeks of January. The causes of the
tightening are not entirely clear, but the fact that the Bank of France
in the week ending January 17 sharply reduced its holdings of paper acquired
through market operations supports the interpretation that the authorities
tightened the market to limit outflows of short-term capital.
The $260 million net increase in French official reserves in
November and December, when Algerian conversions of francs for dollars to
buy gold from us amounted to $85 million, indicates a net inflow of short-
term capital into franc assets of the order of magnitude of $350 million.
(The balance on current and long-term capital transactions is thought to have
been relatively small.) There was a very large inflow immediately after
sterling devaluation. Subsequently there were outflows, including payments
for gold bought on the London market by French hoarders, and some further
outflow appears to have occurred early in January. With the change in
official money market policy mentioned above, such outflows may have been
slowed.
Though activity on the Paris gold market has greatly diminished,
the price for Napoleon coins on January 18 still represented a premium of
61 per cent over their gold content.
French bond yields have risen further, and on January 12 the yield
on public sector bonds (net of withholding tax) was 6.59 per cent, compared
with 6.40 per cent in early November. In the fourth quarter of 1967 two
French bond issues totaling the equivalent of $42 million were floated in
the Euro-bond market, one for dollars by the postal administration and one
for French francs by a pharmacological company.

IV -15
While French monetary policy appears to be aimed at protecting
French reserves from capital outflows, the Government announced on
January 24 a program of fiscal measures to stimulate consumption and in-
vestment. Despite a continuing rise in French industrial production through
November, earlier hopes of sharp expansion in domestic and foreign demand
were not being borne out. Before the changes just announced, the government's
over-all budget deficit (including that of the social security system) was
to have been much smaller in 1968 than in 1967. The new program includes
cancelation of part of the personal income tax instalment payable on
February 1, acceleration of the increase in family allowances originally
scheduled for October 1968, an increase in old age pensions and increased
financial aid for industrial investment in depressed areas and for housing.
With this program, the projected 1968 budget deficit is raised from Fr. 2
billion to Fr. 5 billion, which, however, will still be less than the 1967
deficit of over Fr. 7 billion.
According to press reports, the government will not float any
long-term bond issues this year. The deficit is therefore likely to be
financed partly through the banking system.
Recent monetary policy developments in Canada reflect a continuing
concern about wage and price advances as well as market fears of adverse
effects upon the Canadian balance of payments of the new U.S. direct in-
vestment controls and of the threatened U.S. import tax. Uneasiness about
maintenance of the exchange parity of the Canadian dollar led to heavy
forward buying of U.S. dollars by U.S. and Canadian companies in the week
ending January 18. The Canadian banks bought U.S. dollars spot, to cover

IV -16
their forward sales, and thus caused a drain on official reserves. Effective
January 22, the Bank of Canada raised its discount rate for the third time
in five months -- bringing it to the crisis level of 7 per cent -- and at
the same time announced that the chartered banks would discourage the use
of bank credit by Canadian subsidiaries of foreign companies "to facilitate
abnormal transfers of funds abroad" or "to meet requirements in Canada
which have in the past normally been met by parent companies."
Sizable spreads have opened up between Canadian and U.S. interest
rates, on an uncovered basis. The Canadian Treasury bill rate was 6.08 per
cent on January 26, nearly 1-1/4 per cent above the rate on the U.S. three-
month bill. (The covered arbitrage differential was very small.) Long-
term bond yields, which leveled off in Canada as in the United States in
November and December, rose further in Canada after the latest discount rate
increase. On January 24 the spread as against U.S. long-term yields was
1-1/2 per cent.
The Bank of Japan's discount rate increase on January 6 -- the
second in four months -- was followed by an increase in most commercial
bank lending rates. The prime lending rate, for example, stayed equal to
the discount rate, rising from 5.840 per cent to 6.205 per cent. Average
bank lending rates have undoubtedly risen further; from a low of 7.28 per cent
in August they had risen by November to 7.34 per cent.
Call loan rates rose to 8.395 per cent on January 6. This compares
with a low last May of 6.570 per cent. Smaller banks have reportedly been
shifting out of bonds into call loans. Bond prices and yields in Japan are
controlled fairly closely by the Government. The Ministry of Finance is con-
sidering raising the yield on 7-year national bonds, which is now 6.795 per
cent, in order to facilitate absorption of new issues.

IV -17
U.K. Government expenditure plans. In its latest move to assure
the viability of the new $2.40 pound, the British government announced on
January 16 that it would reduce public sector spending in the next fiscal
year (starting April 1) by £300 million in real terms below earlier plans.
The spending program for the following year was pared by £416 million. These
cuts are in addition to the downward revisions in spending plans made when
the pound was devalued on November 18.
The changes in expenditure plans are reviewed in Appendix C. Any
appraisal of effects must be tentative in the absence of information on
revenue plans. To hold consumer demand in check, Chancellor of the Exchequer
Jenkins has promised a "tough" budget -- which will be presented in March, a
month earlier than usual. It is likely that a sizable increase in taxes will
be included in that budget.
In promising restrictions for the future but imposing none now, the
Chancellor has run the risk of adding fuel to the surge in consumer spending
set in motion by the devaluation. Sales of consumer goods reportedly have
boomed. People have evidently speeded up purchases they might otherwise have
deferred, in order to avoid the price rises devaluation will inevitably produce.
The possibilies of higher sales taxes and of more restraints on installment
buying in the near future has doubtless increased the incentives to buy now.

1/APPENDIX A: THE NEW UNIFIED BUDGET CONCEPTS-
The Federal Budget is undergoing a two stage conceptual
revision in accordance with the recommendations of the President's
Commission on Budget Concepts (PCBC)./ The first of these stages is
being incorporated in the Budget just released, and it consists of a
rearrangement of existing budgetary data. The second stage is planned
for the January 1970 Budget Document. At that time receipts and
expenditure data will be shifted to an accrual basis and the subsidy
element in Federal loan programs will be separately identified.
The Structure of the New Budget. The new (fiscal 1969)
budget aims to provide, in one unified presentation, the role of the
Federal Government in the income and product flows of the economy and
the Government's activities as a lender and as a borrower. Thus the
new budget provides information which previously had to be pieced
together from the national income and the cash budgets and from some
supplementary tables in addition.
While the cash budget and the national income budget are
replaced by a unified presentation in the new budget, the administra-
tive budget is completely eliminated as an official Government budget.
The Commission felt that because the administrative budget excludes
trust fund receipts and expenditures it was misleading as a guide to
the impact of Federal programs on the economy. Information on indi-
vidual trust funds will, of course, be preserved.
In essence, then, the new budget presents a national
income-type budget and a cash budget in one unified presentation.
However, there are some coverage and accounting modifications which
make the new budget somewhat different from both the national income
accounts and the old cash budget. Leaving these modifications aside
for the moment, the new budget summary, as shown in Table 1, will now
be traced through. The new summary starts with a tabulation of requests
for budget authority that authorize the Government to make outlays.
There follows the receipts and expenditure account which is
a modified version of the Federal sector in the national income accounts.
Receipts consist of all the tax income of the Federal Government and
all compulsory fees. Receipts associated with activities which are
1/ Prepared by Helmut Wendel, Economist, Government Finance Section,
Division of Research and Statistics.

A- 2
operated as business-type enterprises or which are market oriented in
character (such as receipts from the sale of goods or from interest
payments) are not included as receipts, and instead are offset against
the expenditures to which they relate.
Expenditures include all payments that generate current
income for the recipients. A surplus or deficit is shown for the
receipt-expenditure account; this shows to what extent the Federal
Government provided net additions to or subtractions from other sectors'
incomes, and is thus similar in spirit to the Federal surplus or deficit
in the national income accounts.
Next the summary budget shows the Federal loan account. This
is the section in which Federal loan programs are recorded; loan repay-
ments are netted against loan disbursements.
Net lending is added to expenditures as previously defined
to arrive at the concept of total budget outlays. The difference
between receipts and total budget outlays is defined as the budget
deficit. This budget surplus or deficit is roughly equivalent to the
old cash surplus or deficit.
The budget summary continues by showing an account for the
means of financing of the deficit. A deficit can be financed by bor-
rowing from the public (including issuance of participation certifi-
cates) by drawing down cash balances, by increasing unpaid checks
outstanding or by seignorage receipts. Finally, there is a table on
outstanding Federal securities and loans. The change in outstanding
Federal securities held by the public ties in with borrowing from the
public, and the change in direct Federal loans outstanding ties in
with new net lending. As a memorandum item, the amount of guaranteed
and insured Federal loans is also shown.
In the future, the old Administrative budget and the cash
budget will no longer be published, but the figures for fiscal year
1969 on these alternative bases will be shown this year. As for the
Federal sector in the national income accounts, it is expected that
revisions will be made to bring the NIA Federal sector into conformity
with the new budget, but only after the second stage of revisions has
been introduced in the budget document.

Budget coverage and classification. Table 2 presents a
brief reconciliation between the new budget and the old budgets with
data for fiscal years 1967 to 1969. The detailed entries that are
involved in such a reconciliation are listed in Table 3 and further
illustrated in Tables 4 to 6. The various budgets differ partly
because the sector coverage is different and partly because certain
transactions are differently classified as among receipts, spending,
borrowing, and other means of financing.
In regard to sector coverage, the new budget excludes
government-sponsored agencies that have become wholly privately owned,
The Federal home loan banks and the Federal land banks fall in this
category. In excluding these banks, the Commission considered not
only their formal ownership status, but also the fact that they are
not subject to budgetary review. In the new budget their net lending
will not be included in Federal loans and their borrowing in the market
will not be part of Federal borrowing from the public for either FY
1968 or FY 1969.
The 1969 Budget recommends accelerating the transfer of
secondary market operations of FNMA to private ownership. Hence, at
some time in the future the new budget is expected to exclude the secondary
market operations fund of FNMA. By issuing additional stock to mortgage
companies that agency would be able to retire its Federal capital sub-
scription of $190 million.
The new budget discontinues treatment of the District of
Columbia as a Federal agency, so that only direct Federal payments to
the District will henceforth appear in the budget.
The classification of transactions as among receipts,
expenditures, borrowing, and other means of financing is indicated in
Table 3. Federal receipts in the new budget will shrink somewhat
relative to the cash budget due to the exclusion of all receipts
obtained from market oriented activities, such as the sale of surplus
property, rents and royalties, etc. This decline is only partly off-
set by the inclusion in receipts of employee contributions to Federal
retirement funds. The timing of receipts remains the same as in the
cash budget until the second stage of revisions.
As already mentioned two measurements of Federal expenditures
will be presented, expenditures excluding loans, and total outlays equal
to expenditures plus loans. The loan category, however, will not
include soft currency loans to foreigners and nonrecourse-type agri-
cultural loans. These are classed as expenditures. The aim is to have
only bona fide financial transactions in the loan category. In the
1/ The loan account in the budget includes only those domestic credit
transactions where there are definite requirements for full repay-
ment of the loans, plus all foreign loans made on commercial terms.

A -5
second stage of revisions, it is planned to estimate the subsidy element
in loan programs and to enter the subsidy portion of the loans in expen-
ditures excluding loans.
Net issues of participation certificates to the public will
henceforth not be deducted from outlays, but will be included as a
means of financing the deficit. The timing of expenditures will be
changed only slightly in the first stage of revisions by going from
the checks-paid basis of the cash budget to a checks-issued basis. The
offsetting accounting entry will be made in means of financing other
than borrowing, where the clearing account for outstanding but unpaid
checks will be entered as an account payable item.
Borrowing from the public will be similar to the old concept
of net cash borrowing, except that participation certificates and accrued
interest on savings bonds and Treasury bills are added, and borrowing by
the privately-owned Federally sponsored agencies (FHLB, FLB) is sub-
tracted,

APPENDIX C: REDUCTION OF U.K. PUBLIC SECTOR EXPENDITURE PLANS*
The British government announced on January 16 that it would
reduce public sector spending in the next fiscal year (starting April 1)
by £300 million in real terms below earlier plans. The spending program
for the following year was pared by £416 million.
These cuts are in addition to the downward revisions in
spending plans made when the pound was devalued on November 18, which
amounted to £100 million for defense spending and £70 million for
capital outlays in nationalized industries. At that time, the govern-
ment also announced that refunds and premium payments under the Selective
Employment Tax would be discontinued except in the development areas,
and that export rebates would be abolished. Each of these two moves was
expected to save the Treasury about £100 million. Consequently, the
total by which the government has reduced its spending targets for the
coming fiscal year amounts to almost £700 million.
The cutbacks will slow, but not eliminate, growth in public
expenditures in the near term. Figures released by the government--
covering all national and local public spending except, apparently, debt
interest--show that outlays in the public sector in fiscal 1968-69 will
be 4.4 per cent higher in real terms than the expected total in the
year ending March 31. This is less than half the rate by which public
sector outlays this year will exceed those for 1966-67. But public
spending will apparently still be rising faster than national income,
which the government now predicts will grow by 4 per cent next year.
In the following fiscal year (1969-70), however, spending in the
public sector is scheduled to level off entirely.
Composition of the cuts in planned spending
The January 16 reduction of £300 million for the fiscal year
beginning April 1 will be limited exclusively to the civilian economy, and
about 75 per cent of the new cutback for the following year relates to
non-military categories. Both current and capital expenditures are
affected, as are virtually all areas of government activity and
responsibility.
Because of the implications for the world balance of power and
Britain's status as a major power, the most highly publicized element of
the latest retrenchment package was the forthcoming reduction in Britain's

defense commitments. However, this does not affect the fiscal year
1968-69. The defense budget for fiscal 1969-70 will be trimmed £110 mil-
lion below previous plans. In absolute terms, because of earlier cuts
in plans defense spending will fall in each of the next two years. The
decline will continue into the 1970's. The contract for the purchase
of 50 F-lll's from the U.S. has been canceled, a move which is expected
to save Britain--after allowance for payment of cancellation costs--
£400 million through 1977-78.
The largest item in the £300 million to be lopped off next
year is an £80 million reduction in earlier plans for capital investment
grants to private industry. The saving will be accomplished through
reversal of a previously instituted speed-up in the disbursement of these
payments.
In education, the principal savings are to come from a two-year
postponement of the raising of the minimum school leaving age from 15
to 16. In addition, grants to "direct grant" schools are to be reduced,
as are capital expenditures for higher educational institutions. Provision
of free milk in schools will be discontinued.
In the medical field, prescription charges will be re-imposed
on those deemed able to afford them. National health contributions from
the public will be raised, allegedly to help meet the cost of prescrip-
tions for the needy. Dental charges will be raised, and planned health
and welfare capital expenditure outlays will be lowered.
Increases in family allowances will be paid as previously
planned, but the full amount of the increase will be defrayed through
upward adjustment of income taxes.
The number of housing starts in the public sector is to be
lowered below pre-devaluation plans, and previously scheduled expendi-
tures by the central government on road building will be reduced.
Civil defense and other Home Department expenditures will be
lowered and civil service employment will be held at current levels.
Appraisal of effects
In the absence of information on revenue plans, any appraisal
of the government's revamped spending program must necessarily be
tentative. It seems clear, though, that if public sector spending
increases as now planned, vigorous steps to curb demand elsewhere
will still be required. The budget is to be presented in March, a
month earlier than usual.

C- 3
Four per cent growth in national income appears to be the
maximum permissible if the unemployment rate is not to drop well below
two per cent, into the zone where wages and prices are likely to increase
rapidly. With growth in exports and private sector investment both
expected and desired next year, the consumer sector emerges as the
logical candidate to bear the brunt of further restrictive measures.
In fact, likely growth in other areas implies that the volume of
consumer expenditures must be kept at roughly current levels next
year if the overall 4 per cent growth target is not to be exceeded.
The most serious doubts about the government's ability to
keep a sufficiently eight rein on consumer spending center on the
apparent inadequacies of current "incomes policies." The government's
official line is still that wages should be increased only to reward
proven productivity increases or to raise the pay of the lowest paid
workers. However, the government's legal power over wages is now
limited to delaying increases by seven months, and even this power is
undercut by the provision which permits settlements to be made retroactive.
From the end of June--when the period of severe restraint ended--
through December, weekly wage rates rose by 3.9 per cent. Even after
July--when settlements deferred by the government's restraint program
caused the rate to jump 1.6 per cent--the rate of increase was high.
In the five months from July to December, wage rates rose by 2-1/4 per
cent, or by almost 5-1/2 per cent at an annual rate. Therefore, even
before the devaluation created new inflationary pressures, wages were
rising at a considerably faster rate than the approximately 3 per cent
at which productivity appears to be increasing.
