CURRENT ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL CONDITIONS
By the Staff
Board of Governors
of the Federal Reserve SystemFebruary 28, 1968

I-1
SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK
Outlook for economic activity
Over-all demands are expected to continue to expand at a very
rapid pace in the second quarter. Assuming no Congressional action on
the tax surcharge, and some further monetary restraint, growth in real
GNP should be only a little below the 6 per cent annual rate anticipated
for this quarter. With pressure on resources heightened and wages rising
faster than productivity, industrial and consumer prices seem certain to
remain under strong upward pressure.
In addition to substantially higher consumer demand, an increase
in Federal defense expenditures larger than previously anticipated will
be adding to rapid growth in GNP. Stepped-up requirements for manpower
and military equipment have already pushed expenditures above those pro-
jected in the Budget, and further increases are anticipated, although
the amounts are still unknow.
In the coming quarter, as in the first quarter, accelerating
consumer expenditures are expected to be the major factor stimulating
economic growth. The rise in retail sales indicated for January and
February implies a first quarter gain in consumer outlays of about 2 per
cent from the fourth quarter. Higher social security payments and
rapidly rising hourly wages and employment can be expected to push up
disposable income in the next quarter--sharply so without a tax increase.
Thus, even with no reduction in the saving rate from recent high levels,
consumers are likely to increase their spending sharply.

I-2
Although the economy entered the year with large inventories
of most goods, continued accumulation of autos and hedge buying of
steel suggest that additions to inventories will continue at a substan-
tial rate in the second quarter. However, in view of the mortgage
credit situation no further increase in residential construction
activity is expected. Increases in fixed capital investment are likely
to be of moderate dimensions.
Outlook for resource use and prices
Industrial production edged off a bit in January, and it is
expected to change little in February, but is projected to resume its
upswing thereafter.
Production has been limited in part in January and February
by sporadic work stoppages in the auto industry, and by the continuing
strikes in the copper and glass industries. On the other hand, strikes
of bituminous coal miners and railroad workers have ended. The higher
production levels in prospect would still suggest only a little further
rise in manufacturing capacity utilization through the second quarter from
the rate reached in December. Upward pressure on wages will continue
in the second quarter. Contract negotiations in aluminum, apparel,
and shipbuilding are likely to result in wage adjustments at the "going
rate" of 6 per cent or more; and deferred increases in the 4 to 5 per
centrange will be received by nearly 2 million workers. With no let-up
in wage pressures, unit labor costs are likely to continue their
upward course even if sizable gains in industrial production--and
productivity--are achieved.

I-3
Through mid-February industrial prices continued sharply
upward over a wide range of materials and products. Moreover, for 3
months now prices of foods and foodstuffs have been rising at whole-
sale. With food prices increasing and service costs tending to
accelerate in recent months, the consumer price index is probably
rising at least as fast as the 3.6 per cent annual rate of the last
3 months of 1967, and perhaps faster. There is little prospect for
any significant slowing in the pace of advance over the next several
months.
Demand for credit
Given the modest rise expected in expenditures for plant
and equipment and inventories in the next few months, businesses may
be able to meet their financing needs with only a relatively moderate
recourse to external financing. Funds should be somewhat more
available from internal sources in view of the build-up in liquid
asset holdings during the latter half of 1967 and the better than
expected profit performance of recent months. Moreover, corporate
income tax payments, though still substantial, are not expected to be
as large as in the spring of last year when there were sizable
accelerated payments.
Such business credit demands as develop are likely to focus
more on banks, particularly in light of the continued high rate of
inventory accumulation. The near-term volume of new corporate issues
in the bond market is expected to remain below early winter levels,

I-4
unless fears of a credit squeeze begin to re-emerge. In this case
further anticipatory borrowing in capital markets and also at banks
could well develop. No let-up yet appears in sight for municipal
bond offerings, however, though postponements of new issues could
develop if the recent upward yield movements persists.
Federal Government credit demands over the balance of the
fiscal year could be sizable enough to become a source of market
pressure. Without a tax increase,assuming spending rises above
Budget estimates (as we have projected), and depending on how low
a mid-year Treasury cash balance is feasible, anywhere from $4-1/2
to $6-1/2 billion of new cash (including PC's) will have to be raised
between now and mid-year, in addition to the $1.2 billion that would
be raised by completion of the full cycle of weekly cash additions
to the 3-month bill auction begun in the last week of February. Even
the lower end of the range is above current market expectations.
These factors on the demand side suggest a mixed interest
rate outlook, with the focus of upward interest rate pressures in the
market for municipal and U.S. Government securities. Part of the
Federal Government's cash need may be financed through participation
certificates, and this would tend to affect intermediate- and longer-
term yields, with some spill-over, perhaps, into the corporate market.
Mortgage yields may not show much, if any, further upward push--at
least until the late March--early April interest-crediting period for
thrift institutions--since it appears that residential mortgage demands
are being limited by current mortgage costs.

I -5
Supply of funds
Financial institutions are likely to continue to find net
funds available for lending under some constraint over the next few
mouths. While partial data for banks and nonbank intermediaries
suggest that some improvement may be occurring in net inflows of
time and savings accounts from the sharply reduced January pace, these
inflows are likely to remain below the pace of summer and early fall,
and could decline further if short-term rates rise from current levels.
With respect to commercial banks, the recent modest pick-up
in time and savings deposits has mainly reflected growth in co sumer-
type accounts, and continued moderate expansion in these deposits
is expected. Major banks have thus far shown little inclination to
push negotiable CD's onto the market, largely because they have not
been able to see an immediate need for the funds, but also because
Euro-dollars have remained generally available at relatively attractive
rates.
Any significant strengthening of business loan demands
during the spring would be accompanied by a greater effort on the part
of major banks to obtain CD funds. Such activity could, for a time,
raise the over-all rate of banks' time and savings deposit expansion
somewhat further. But the upward pressures on short-term market
interest rates likely to be generated would tend, in turn, to limit
banks' ability to continue obtaining net new funds through the CD
route and would probably lead to some further slackening in growth
of other time deposits. It is expected that private demand deposits
will not be a very substantial source of funds to banks over the coming
months, with their growth remaining below last year's pace, since
liquidity demands may moderate.

I-6
The rather moderate increases expected in deposits at bank
and nonbank financial institutions will tend to contribute to main-
tenance of relatively taut lending terms. The survey of mortgage
lender intentions taken early in February suggests no marked change
through spring in the cautionary attitudes toward, or the level of,
new commitments; recently, new commitments have been running slightly
below normal for this period of the year. But any significant further
market yield increases, especially for short-term rates, could further reduce
the availability of funds to the mortgage, and also the municipal,
markets.
The Federal Government may find that supply conditions make
it somewhat more difficult to finance its cash requirements between
now and mid-year, even with little further change in monetary policy.
Limitations on the ability of banks to obtain additional new funds,
given the relatively narrow spread prevailing between market interest
rates and ceiling rates on bank deposits, could force the Government
to finance more outside the banking system if business loan demands
show a resurgence. Such a development usually adds to upward pressure
on market interest rates. However, a tendency toward upward rate
movements at the shorter end of the maturity structure could be
moderated by sizable amounts of funds seeking re-investment as a result
of the large maturities of tax bills over coming months (less than
half of which, last year, were turned in for taxes).

I -7
Balance of payments
Recent news about the U.S. balance of payments continues to
be bleak. Merchandise imports increased sharply further in January,
to a rate 16 per cent higher than a year earlier. Imports of steel
and copper, which reflect special factors, account for less than one-
third of the 12-month increase. Although exports also rose sharply in
January after dipping in December, the trade surplus was at an annual
rate of only $1-1/4 billion, somewhat lower than in the fourth quarter
and well below the rate of $4.3 billion for the first three quarters
of 1967.
Thus, despite a more than seasonal reflow of bank credit in
January and, presumably, some reduction in direct investment outflows
as a result of the new mandatory restrictions, the over-all deficit
on the liquidity basis has remained disappointingly large. After
rough allowance for the large seasonal adjustment needed at this time
of year, the liquidity deficit appears to have been at an annual rate
in the $2-1/2 billion to $4 billion range in January-February.
The official settlements deficit has been much smaller than
this, thanks to further borrowing by U.S. head office banks from their
foreign branches operating in the Euro-dollar market, where supplies
of funds have continued large. On an unadjusted basis, there has been
an official settlements surplus, and the Federal Reserve has been able
to make substantial repayments of outstanding swap drawings. But gold
losses have continued as a result both of sales by the Pool in the London

I -8
market and of foreign central bank purchases. The United States is
purchasing European currencies drawn from the IMF by Canada, and will
probably draw on its IMF gold tranche position early in March (confi-
dential until announced), for the purpose of making further repayments
of outstanding Federal Reserve swap drawings.
Economic activity in Europe has recently been expanding
vigorously. A continuation of this expansion should provide the United
States this year with an opportunity for its most rapid export expansion
since 1963. But until the surge in imports can be considerably slowed
down, the trade surplus will continue to run well below last year's
level, and the over-all liquidity deficit will remain large in spite
of cuts in outflows of U.S. capital.

THE ECONOMIC PICTURE IN DETAIL
Gross national product. The economy appears to be continuing
its rapid expansion. Assuming no action on the income tax surcharge
and some increase in monetary restraint, gross national product should
increase by about $18.5 billion, annual rate, in the second quarter,
only slightly less than the projected increase for the first quarter.
These increases in GNP are larger than in the second half of 1967 when
GNP rose at an annual rate of $16 billion per quarter. But we expect
a much stronger rise in final sales this half year--a rate of about
$18 billion in each of the first two quarters compared to an average
of less than $12 billion in the last two quarters of 1967--and much
smaller increases in inventory investment than in the preceding half
year.
Price increases in the first half of 1968 are expected to
be similar to those in recent quarters. In the second half of 1967,
the GNP deflator speeded-up to an annual rate of increase of 3.7 per
cent, as compared to 2.3 per cent in the first half of the year. Heavy
demand pressures are expected to push the rise in real output up to an
annual rate of over 5.5 per cent in the first half of this year--more
than 1 percentage point above the rate of increase of the second half
of 1967.
The rapid economic expansion projected reflects the combined
impact of sharply rising personal consumption, an increase in business
fixed capital investment, and continued increases in defense spending
at a faster rate than we had previously assumed. The slight slowing
projected in the rate of expansion in real GNP from the first to the
second quarter of this year--from nearly 6 per cent to 5-1/2 per cent--
reflects in the main a slowing of the rise in business fixed capital
spending and a leveling off in the rate of inventory investment.

II -2
The marked rise estimated for consumer expenditures in the
first half of this year is in response to expected large gains in
personal income, Increases in personal income were large in the latter
part of 1967, but part of the rise was not reflected in consumption
because of a further elevation of the saving rate--to 7.5 per cent in
the fourth quarter. In the first half of this year, we expect income
increases to be even larger than in last year's second half, but we
also expect consumer spending to keep pace with incomes, with only a
slight decline in the saving rate.
Incomplete information on retail sales for the first two
months of 1968 lends support to this assumption. In the durable
goods sector, unit sales of new domestic cars in January totaled 8.0
million, annual rate. Although the February rate appears to be running
somewhat lower, increasing sales are projected for March reflecting
higher incomes ready availability of desired models and intensified
dealer competition. Sales of domestic cars are projected at a rate
of 8.0 million in the first quarter, and 8.5 million in the second
quarter. Other consumer durable goods purchases are also expected to
rise in response to increases in income and a higher level of home
competitions.
Sales of nondurable goods moved up about 3 per cent in
January from December, and seem to be holding at an advanced level
in February. In our projection, sales of nondurables for the first
quarter as a whole have been held at about the January level, which implies
a substantial increase from the fourth quarter. Services are expected
to continue rising at least as rapidly as in other recent quarters.

II -3
Larger increases in consumer spending for nondurable goods
and services are anticipated for the second quarter, as the full
impact of increased social security benefits is reflected in outlays.
The scheduled increase in social security benefits will amount to
about $3.6 billion at an annual rate. In 1965, a large increase in
social security benefits was promptly reflected in higher outlays for
nondurables, and we are assuming a repetition of this pattern.
Recent changes in the international situation seem likely
to lead to substantial additions to defense outlays over recent Budget
estimates. Our projections--based solely on public information--assume
defense outlays will rise at a rate of about $1 billion in each of the
first two quarters, about double the rise shown in the Budget. This
assumed rise appears minimal in view of the January call-up of reserves
and widespread discussions of further increases in the size of the
armed forces and in military equipment requirements.
In the Federal nondefense sector, expenditures are expected
to rise at an annual rate of $0.8 billion in each of the first two
quarters, in part reflecting higher CCC purchases of agricultural
products.
Under these assumptions, the Federal deficit, NIA basis,
may decline somewhat in the first quarter to an annual rate of $9.5
billion, but rise in the second quarter to a $12.5 billion rate--
about the same rate as for calendar 1967 as a whole. Receipts will
be increasing sharply as a result of rising personal income and an
anticipated substantial increase in corporate profits. The increase

II -4
in social security taxes will also help to reduce the first quarter
deficit, but will be more than offset by the rise in social security
benefits in the second quarter. State and local government purchases
should continue to provide their customary stimuli to the economy.
Neither business investment nor residential construction
appears likely to provide much additional stimulus after the first
quarter. After leveling off in the first quarter of this year at
1.45 million units, housing starts are expected to dip slightly in the
second quarter. However, with costs and prices rising, residential
construction expenditures in the secondquarter should equal the $27.7
billion rate projected for the first quarter.
The expansion shown in fixed business investment continues
to be based primarily on the November Commerce-SEC survey. (The
next survey of investment plans will be available about March 6.)
However, more recent data for machinery shipments and unfilled orders
and the greater-than-expected strength in corporate profits provide
support to our projected rise in dollar fixed investment expenditures
in the second quarter.
Nonfarm inventory accumulation, which was at an annual rate
of $7.7 billion in the fourth quarter, is expected to accelerate to
$10 billion or more in each of the first two quarters of the year.
The rise in dealer's stocks of automobiles this quarter is expected
to be more than seasonal as strike-induced shortages are made up. The
stock of new cars in mid-February was running more than 5 per cent above the
end-of-December level, but was still moderately below year-ago levels.

II -5
In addition, steel is expected to be stockpiled at a faster rate both
this quarter and next in anticipation of a possible strike at the end
of July. The accumulation for autos and steel--amounting to perhaps
an annual rate of $3 billion--is expected to be on top of a further
accumulation of stocks of other consumer goods (estimated at about
$6 billion, annual rate), as consumer outlays rise, as well as a
further rise in defense inventories (about $1 billion).

II -8
Industrial production. Industrial production is expected to
show little, if any, increase in February following a decline from
161.8 in December to a preliminary figure of 161.2 in January. The
January figure was 2 per cent above the reduced level reached a year
earlier and was 3.5 per cent above the June 1967 low. Production changes
in January reflected only in part special situations such as work stoppages
at GM and the end of a strike in the machinery industry. Decreases were
fairly general in production of consumer goods and industrial materials,
where business inventories had reached high levels and final demands
had not been quite as strong as anticipated.
In February, auto assemblies are indicated to be down 5 per
cent or more to an annual rate of 7.8 million units from 8.3 in January
and 9.0 in December. The February decline for some models reflects
additional work stoppages, but dealer sales of new autos generally
have been a little disappointing to producers and not up to the earlier
advanced rates of output; thus, dealers' stocks have been rising
towards the relatively high levels prevailing a year ago.
Weekly steel production resumed its advance in mid-January
but output for the month was below December, on a seasonally adjusted
basis. After the first week of February, steel production leveled
off again so that only a small rise is indicated for February. Steel
consumption in capital goods industries as well as in autos and
appliances is reported by the industry to be below earlier expectations.

II -9
Output of crude oil and petroleum products is estimated to
be up somewhat in February but additional weakness is indicated in some
other nondurable goods industries. Also, more complete data for the
textile industry for January suggest a larger decrease than the 1/2
per cent shown by the Board's preliminary index for textiles.
Capacity utilization. Utilization of capacity by manufacturers
was estimated to be 84.5 per cent in January, down from 85.4 per cent
in the previous month. At the January level the operating rate was
only slightly above last summer. Manufacturing production in January
was nearly 2 per cent higher than a year earlier, but over the same
period capacity is estimated to have grown by more than 6 per cent.
Pressures on capacity vary somewhat from industry to industry.
Utilization rates are high in the aircraft and electric power generating
equipment industries, and only moderate amounts of unused capacity
remain for production of most textile, petroleum and rubber products.
Although steel production continued high in February as users hedged
against a possible strike a sizable margin of unused steel capacity
remains.

New orders and shipments of durable goods. New orders received
in January by durable goods producers were originally reported down 4.7
per cent from the previous month, following an extraordinary 12 per cent
increase in December. However, confidential information received after
release of the advance report indicates a larger decline--perhaps 6.5
per cent. Some decline in January was not unexpected since the earlier
increase appeared to be partly due to irregular factors and faulty
seasonal adjustment.
Shipments of durable goods were originally reported to have
increased 4.1 per cent in January. But in this case, also, information
received after original release of this figure indicates an increase of
only around 1 per cent. Either figure, however, results in a total
volume of January shipments well above August--the month before the
auto strike--and above the high of December 1966.
Business inventories. As in 1966, 1967 ended with inventory
accumulation showing a pronounced spurt. In book value terms,
inventory accumulation by manufacturers and distributors totaled
nearly $1.3 billion in December (preliminary) and $1.1 billion in
November and, for the entire fourth quarter, totaled $2.8 billion,
or an annual rate of $11,2 billion. This compares with a $4 billion
annual rate in the third quarter and $0.3 billion in the second.
A large part of the book value increase now reported for
late 1967 apparently reflected sharply rising prices, and after
allowance for price increases through an inventory valuation adjustment

II -11
and also for changes in the rate of inventory investment outside of
manufacturing and trade, total nonfarm inventory accumulation on a
GNP basis showed a much smaller increase in the fourth quarter.
In contrast to late 1966, business sales--primarily at
manufacturers--were rising sharply in November and December 1967, when
the rate of inventory accumulation jumped; and the over-all ratio of
business inventories to sales dropped substantially and in December,
for the first time in 1967 was somewhat below the high end-of-1966
level.
As shown in the table--which is based on book value figures--
manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers all participated in the
sharp step-up in the rate of inventory accumulation over the last
half of the year. The most pronounced shifts, however, were at
wholesalers and retailers--from appreciable liquidation in the second
quarter to moderate accumulation in the third and sizable accumulation
in the fourth. At retail, this shift reflected to a major degree
developments at auto dealers.
At manufacturers, the rate of accumulation in the fourth
quarter was double the second and third quarter rates but only half
as large as the extraordinary rate of late 1966. The step-up at
manufacturers in late 1967 stemmed largely from a shift from liquida-
tion to accumulation in consumer durable goods industries (including
autos). The rate of accumulation in business and defense industries
was maintained at a fairly sizable pace throughout the last half of
the year.

Retail sales. Retail sales, according to Census advance
estimates, rose almost 3 per cent in January to a level nearly 6 per
cent above a year earlier. In the last half of 1967, except for a
spurt in September and a drop in October, total sales had iheld close
to the rate at mid-year. Weekly sales figures for the first two full
weeks of February suggest that a further small rise in sales--less
than 1 per cent--is occurring this month.

II -13
Sales at durable goods stores in January were up more than
total sales, led by a rise in new car sales and an advance in sales at
lumber and other building materials outlets which more than offset
a very sharp drop at furniture and appliance stores. Gains were
registered at all types of nondurable goods stores except department
stores.

Unit sales and stocks of autos. Dealer deliveries of new
domestic autos in the first 20 days of February were 14 per cent above
the relatively low level of a year earlier, when sales were at a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of only 6.7 million units. For February
as a whole, the annual rate of sales is expected to be about 7,5
million units, as compared with 8.0 million in January and 7,4 million
in December. (Seasonal factors for both the sales and stock series
have been revised to allow for an indicated shift of some of the spring
sales to the winter months.)il q

II -14
The stock of new cars (seasonally adjusted) at the end of the
second period of February was moderately higher than at the end of
January, which in turn was 5 per cent above December. On February 20,
the stock was 7 per cent below the high level of a year earlier and this
gap is expected to be narrowed further by the end of the month. The
increase in inventories has continued to be limited by work stoppages.
Sales of imported cars for the year 1967 increased 17 per
cent from the previous year and the import share of the market rose
from 7.3 to 9.3 per cent. January figures show a further rise in the
import share to over 10.5 per cent.
Consumer credit. Early reports on instalment credit develop-
ments at commercial banks are generally consistent with indications
of improvement in retail sales, as reported for January. Auto credit
apparently expanded quite sharply at banks, as did holdings of nonauto
goods paper. Personal loan volume, on the other hand, was about in
line with other recent months, while home improvement credit continued
sluggish. On balance, early reports suggest that January witnessed
a continuation of the somewhat faster rate of expansion in consumer
instalment credit that first became apparent last November, when the net
increase in outstandings was a little over $400 million. In December,
the increase was a little under $400 million.
Meanwhile, there are indications that the especially fast
repayment rate of the second and third quarters of last year has
begun to taper off. In each of those periods, repayments on instal-
ment debt increased more than $500 million. In the final quarter of
1967, however, the increase in repayments was less than $100 million.
As the table shows, much of the pick-up in the second and third

II -15
quarters came in the other consumer goods category, while the fourth
quarter slowdown resulted largely from a reduced rate of repayments
on personal loans.

Note: Figures may not add across due to rounding,
Further evidence of a slower repayments rate is provided by
the ratio of repayments to disposable personal income. The ratio moved
progressively up in 1967 and reached an all-time high of 14.5 per cent
in the third quarter, but it then turned down to 14.3 per cent in the
final quarter. This decline may have important implications for growth
in consumer spending; a decrease in the repayment ratio is customarily
viewed as an indication of the ability and willingness of consumers to
incur more debt. Indeed, as suggested above, a turnaround in consumer
attitudes may actually have begun last November.

II -16
Consumer buying expectations, The Census Quarterly Survey
of Consumer Buying Expectations, taken in January, indicates some
improvement over the October survey in expected purchases of new cars,
household durables, and houses. At 103.9 (Jan. 1967-April 1967=100)
the index for new cars, however, is still below the 104.7 of the July
survey. The indexes for household durables and houses are also below
the July 1967 levels. Expected expenditures on used cars at 103.4
are at a high for the 5 quarters of comparable data. Households
in January were very optimistic about a substantial increase in
family income, with 19.3 per cent of all households expecting an
increase in the next 12 months and only 5.5 expecting a decrease. In
July 1967, the previous high, 17.4 per cent had expected an increase.
Construction and real estate. Total new construction put
in place edged higher in January, almost reaching the peak rate of
March 1966. Private residential activity--already at a near-record
high in December--continued upward for the thirteenth consecutive
month. Private nonresidential construction outlays, which in recent
months have fluctuated narrowly above last April, also increased a
little in January; and public construction expenditures held at about
the advanced December rate.

Seasonally adjusted housing starts, which had dropped sharply
in December after an unusually sustained rise through November, veered
upward again in January. While the January annual rate of 1,445 thousand
was not far from Staff expectations, it barely exceeded the average for
the fourth quarter of 1967 as a whole and was well below the rate of
1,590 thousand reached in November. As in the December decline, the
January rise was broadly based both by type of structure and by region.
Some further advance in the rate of starts seems likely for
February for technical as well as other reasons, even though there
was an appreciable decline in the rate of building permits.

1_/ Seasonally adjusted annual rates; preliminary.
New home sales by speculative builders in December were
maintained at the relatively advanced November rate. Seasonally
adjusted stocks of homes for sale by such builders remained very
near the recent low reached last August, reflecting both high sales
and continuing concern by builders about profit prospects under
conditions of high and rising financing costs, particularly for
Government-assisted mortgages.

II -19
Although lack of desirable used homes for sale has
continued to be a feature of existing-home markets in a number of
areas, sales of existing homes in December were running a fourth
above the reduced year-earlier level, according to the National
Association of Real Estate Boards. In December, as in other recent
months, such homes were selling at prices 5 per cent above a year
earlier. And with mortgage interest rates at or above earlier highs,
indications were that increased reliance was being placed on instal-
ment land contracts, all-cash transfers, and arrangements which permit
assumption by the buyer of the seller's outstandings first mortgage
and the use of a second mortgage in such cases to supplement the
cash-downpayment.
Labor market. After ending the year with a considerable
burst of strength, key labor market measures in January showed
apparently conflicting movements; employment growth slowed significantly,
but the unemployment rate dipped for the third month in a row and was
a shade below the minimum rate attained during 1966.
Nonfarm employment rose only 36,000 in January, as compared
with an average monthly gain of 200,000 during the preceding six months.
However, the slower growth was largely a result of a much larger
than usual seasonal decline in construction employment, which was
down by 120,000--apparently the result of bad weather, Excluding
this decline in construction and returns from strikes, the employment
increase in January would have been about 140,000 (1.7 million at an

II -20
annual rate). This would still be well below the gains af the past
several months, but close to the average increase over the past year.
In manufacturing, employment rose some 45,000, with about
40 per cent of the increase representing the return of workers from
strike, primarily in the machinery industry. Other than this, employ-
ment gains in durable industries were small, but widespread. Non-
durable goods employment was off 15,000, as a result of a dip of this
magnitude in the volatile apparel industry.
The workweek in manufacturing dropped by three-tenths of
an hour in January, reflecting widespread declines which may also have
been largely weather-induced. In nondurable goods industries, the
workweek was down by half an hour, with cuts of over half an hour in
the apparel, textiles and leather industries. There were reductions
in hours in a number of durable goods industries as well. The largest
were in the weather-sensitive lumber and stone, clay and glass
industries--which were offset by a sharp rebound of the workweek in
transportation equipment, as auto plants expanded their output to
regain strike-lost production.
Among other sectors of the economy, apart from the drop in
construction, there were continued strong employment gains in the
State and local government, finance and service sectors (up by 90,000)
and trade (up 30,000); Federal government employment continued to edge
down slightly.

II -21
The unemployment rate declined by two-tenths of one per
cent in January to 3.5 per cent, a drop of 0.8 from the 1967 peak
of 4.3 per cent in October. The January unemployment dip occurred
largely among the more "marginal" members of the labor force; there
was a substantially greater than usual post-Christmas exodus of
adult women from the labor market which reduced their unemployment
rate, and a somewhat smaller than seasonal decline in the number of
teenagers employed. The unemployment decline for both groups probably
represented no more than the difficulties of precise seasonal adjust-
ment of relatively volatile labor force groups at a time of year when
large numbers typically change their labor force status. A more stable
indicator of labor demand, the unemployment rate for adult males aged
25 and over, remained about unchanged at 1.9 per cent, a rate lower
than during the 1966 boom, and about equal to the rate during the
Korean War period.
Earnings. Hourly earnings in manufacturing rose again in
January by 2 cents to $2.93, and were 5.4 per cent higher than a year
earlier. The pattern of much faster than average increases continued
in the low-wage manufacturing industries, and has spread to some
high-wage industries as well. Reflecting the contract settlement
between the U.A.W. and G.M. effective the end of December, hourly
earnings in transportation equipment were up 23 cents, or 6.8 per
cent, from a year earlier. In the low-wage lumber, apparel and
leather industries, hourly earnings have increased 7 per cent or more
since January 1967. Not far behind is the electrical equipment
industry with a 6.7 per cent rise.

II -22
Average hourly earnings in January were more than 6 per cent
above year-earlier levels in most major nonmanufacturing industries,
both high- and low-wage.

The outlook is for further upward pressure on wages in low-
wage industries in February, reflecting the increase in the Federal
minimum wage on February 1. In the higher wage industries, particularly
primary metals, contract negotiations in aluminum in May, and in steel
in July will probably result in wage increases equal to the 6 per cent
and more received by workers in the automobile, farm equipment and
fabricated metal industry contracts.

II -23
Compensation and unit labor costs. Unit labor costs in
manufacturing rose sharply between December and January, on top of
a substantial upward adjustment of the December index. The rise
of 1.5 percentage points in January reflected mainly a surge in
hourly compensation. In addition to the sharp rise in hourly
earnings, an increase in the Social Security wage base was added to
the cost of supplements which are included in employee compensation,
The rate of increase in hourly compensation had eased late in 1967,
edging down from an over-the-year rate of increase of 6,5 per cent in the
first three quarters of 1967 to 5.8 per cent in the fourth quarter,
despite the fact that manufacturing hourly earnings were rising more
rapidly than earlier. In conjunction with a pick-up in productivity,
this had tended to temper the pressure on unit labor costs somewhat
toward the end of 1967. In January, however, the over-the-year rate
of increase in compensation rebounded to 6.7 per cent, output per
manhour failed to show any gain, and unit labor costs shot forward
again. With large wage adjustments still in the offing, further increases
in unit labor costs seem likely in coming months, although larger
productivity gains should keep the increases below the 5.5 per cent rate
of most of 1967.

II -24
Personal income. Personal income rose $2 billion in January
to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $651 billion, up $41 billion
or 6.7 per cent from a year ago. Although the increase in private
wages and salaries, $1.9 billion was in line with the monthly average
increase of 1967, the rise in total personal income was the smallest
since October as it was limited by some special influences which,
on balance, served to raise the,December level and to lower the January
level.
Wholesale prices. The BLS industrial commodity average
increased 0.4 per cent in January, to 107.8 per cent of the 1957-59
average, and continued to rise at about that rate in February. The
January rise exceeded the original BLS estimate, and was the largest
monthly increase in this index since the recent upturn began last summer.
The increase over the 6 months from July to January was at an average
annual rate of 3.4 per cent, with a faster rate since October.
Prices of foods and foodstuffs--and the total wholesale
price index--also increased somewhat more in January than had been
estimated a month ago, and in February farm and food prices continued
on up. The January WPI was at a new high of 107.2, 0.4 per cent
above December and 0.7 per cent above mid-1967, before the recent
run-up in industrial commodity prices began. Average prices of
foods and foodstuffs, though up considerably from November, remain
below mid-1967.

II -25
Prices of fruits and vegetables were up further in January,
with supplies limited by unfavorable weather, and prices of livestock
and products also continued to advance--suggesting continuing increases
in food prices at retail in January and also in February.
Increases in industrial prices were widespread in January.
There were especially large further gains in metals and products,
machinery and equipment, lumber and wood products, and furniture and
household durables. Despite some decline in raw cotton prices
following the earlier sharp run-up, prices of cotton goods rose
further and the entire textile products and apparel group moved
substantially higher. Footwear and rubber and paper products also
continued upward, and prices of autos were increaeed somewhat further.
Prices of chemicals and gasoline declined.
Price increases for raw and semi-fabricated copper materials
continued to bulk large in the January industrial price rise, with the
strike still underway and prices of available copper ingots (largely
imports) moving higher and higher. Raw and semi-fabricated copper
represent less than 2 per cent of the industrial average weight structure
but in January increases in these copper items accounted for almost
15 per cent of the rise in the industrial index. For the entire period
from July to January copper materials accounted directly for about
12 per cent of the rise in the BLS industrial average.
In the FR industrial commodity total, which includes cotton,
as noted in the last Greenbook, the combined rise in copper and cotton
materials--both temporarily in very short supply--accounted directly

II -26
for nearly one-fourth of the index rise from July to January, although
their combined weight is only about 3.5 per cent.
The table below shows the FR industrial commodity total,
which from July to January increased about as much as the BLS
industrial average despite some differences in classification,
together with the special FR groupings of materials and products.
Up to recent months, the fastest rate of advance in industrial
prices during the post-1961 expansion period occurred in late 1965 and
the first half of 1966--particularly the latter period. Price increases
during the past 6 months generally have been at a faster pace than
from mid-1965 to mid-1966.
From July to January, aside from the special cases of
copper--which accounted for the bulk of the rise shown for nonferrous
metals--and cotton--which bulked large in the textile material
increase, especially large increases occurred for steel mill products,
nonmetallic minerals and other building materials, trucks and
passenger cars, and many other products for producers and consumers.
In a few areas, price declines occurred recently, in contrast to
increases from mid-1965 to mid-1966.

Food consumption in 1967 and prospects for 1968. Final
figures on per capita civilian food consumption in 1967 recently
published by the Department of Agriculture (USDA) confirm earlier
estimates that the civilian population ate more in 1967 than ever
before. The USDA also suggests that food supplies likely to be
available in 1968 will enable civilians to sustain this high level
consumption, but probably at somewhat higher prices because of
further expansion of demands. Retail food prices at grocery stores
are expected to average about 2 per cent above 1967 and prices of
food away from home are likely to advance at the 5 per cent annual
rate of the past two years.

Per capita consumption in 1967. Per capita civilian food
consumption in 1967 averaged 2 per cent above 1966 and exceeded the
1946 record by 1 per cent. Both animal and crop product consumption
rates were above a year earlier, as shown in the table.
Military food consumption on a per capita basis was roughly
a half larger than average civilian consumption according to USDA
estimates. It accounted for 2.2 per cent of total food use in 1966
and 1967.
1968 prospects. Per capita consumption prospects in
1968 are firmer for the first half of the year than the second half
when 1968 crop output becomes a more important variable influencing
supply prospects. January 1 livestock inventory data and other
reports suggest that pork and beef supplies will average above
year-earlier levels at least through the first half of the year and
stay close to 1967 in the second half. It seems likely that the
downtrend in dairy consumption will continue and that consumption
of poultry and eggs will remain close to 1967 levels.
Consumption of fresh and processed fruits during the first
half of 1963 is expected to be less than a year earlier but consumption
of processed vegetables will probably be larger. Production of
winter vegetables for fresh market is down 10 per cent. Stocks of
winter potatoes are in surplus supply.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL SITUATION
Bank credit. Commercial bank credit, after expanding
rapidly during January, declined in early February. However, in
large part owing to heavy bank underwriting of the approximately $4
billion Treasury cash financing on February 21, credit is expected to
show another relatively large rise for the month as a whole. The
February bank credit proxy is projected to expand at around a 9 per
cent annual rate, on a daily average basis, as compared to 8.3 per
cent in January.
The more than seasonal decline in credit in early February
reflected heavy liquidation both in loans and investments. During
this period, city banks continued to reduce holdings of Treasury bills,
reflecting mainly further secondary distribution of tax bills acquired
by banks as they underwrote the $2.5 billion tax bill financing in
mid-January. On February 21, however, city banks acquired a substan-
tial volume of the new 15-month notes issued by the Treasury on that
date. Following a sharp increase in January, weekly reporting banks
also reduced their holdings of other securities in early February,
although these security holdings rose somewhat in the week ending
February 21.
The reduction in total loans outstanding in early February
reflects in part a further decline in outstanding business loans, as
these loans continued to retrace part of their rapid December-early
January rise. During the comparable weeks of other recent years, these

III -2
loans had increased. There has been little strength in evidence in
nearly all major industry categories. The principal exception has
been primary metals, where term loans recently have risen substan-
tially--presumably reflecting borrowing by steel companies for plant
and equipment expenditures.
Although corporations in other industry categories still
are reported to be firming up bank credit lines and arranging commit-
ments for term loans and revolving credits, these facilities have been
used relatively little thus far. The low level of takedowns--given the
apparently widespread inventory stockpiling--suggests that corporations
are using up some of the liquidity obtained in their large capital
market financings last year. In view of the President's balance of
payments program, some corporations may have acquired additional cash
as a result of withdrawals of funds from Canada and Europe or the
retention of funds destined for foreign investment.
The loan decline in early February also reflected net
repayments of outstanding indebtedness in certain other major loan
categories. For example, security loans declined substantially
following a sharp rise in late January when dealers built up bill
positions more than normally and also, toward the end of the month,
began to acquire "rights" for the mid-February refunding. However,
securities loans at New York increased sharply for the week ending
February 21, reflecting the Treasury financing on that date. "Other"
loans also showed a large decline, offsetting the increase of the
last week of January associated with a technical overdraft in a
Government securities dealer account.

III -3
Bank deposits. Following a modest upward trend during most
of January, gorwth in total time and savings deposits at commercial
banks accelerated somewhat in late January and early February. The
increase for the month of February, on average, currently is projected
at an annual rate of 8.5 per cent, about the same as in December.

The bulk of the recent increase has been in consumer-type
time deposits. In early February, regular savings deposits at weekly
reporting banks turned up again after declining in January. The
January decline probably reflected in large part the movement of funds
out of these deposits into savings certificates and new consumer-type
open accounts after the interest crediting period. Consumer-type time
deposits other than savings also continued to expand in early February

III -4
at a moderate rate. Total time and savings deposits at country banks
expanded moderately in February following a slowdown in January.
So far this year, outstanding negotiable CD's have shown
only a little more than a normal seasonal rise. Although they declined
over the first two weeks of February at all weekly reporting banks,
this decline was partly offset by a moderate increase at banks in
New York and Chicago in the week ending February 21. While there has
been some firming in CD rates in recent weeks, there increases appear
to have been mainly defensive in character, since issuing banks do not
appear to be particularly inclined to add to outstandings, presumably
because of continued slack loan demands and availability of Euro-
dollars at relatively favorable rates.
Through early February, Euro-dollar rates continued to
decline from the high levels reached in late December, and the cost
of Euro-dollars declined relative to that of CD's. As a result, banks
increased their borrowing from foreign branches. By mid-January, these
borrowings had approximated their mid-December level, and by late
February they had moved above it.
After rising sharply in late December and early January,
the money stock has fluctuated considerably while generally expanding
at a moderate pace. On a daily average basis, the money stock is
projected to increase at a 2.0 per cent annual rate for the month of
February as a whole.

III -5
Nonbank depositary intermediaries. Preliminary data indicate
that savings and loan associations experienced a large net outflow of
share capital in January. Mutual savings banks' inflows, on the other
hand, rebounded sharply in January after outflows in December (all data
unadjusted for seasonal factors). The divergent January trends at
savings and loans and mutual savings banks reflect two main factors.
The savings banks experienced unusually large withdrawals during the
late December grace period, which greatly reduced December flows rela-
tive to January. The associations, on the other hand, did not have
particularly large withdrawals during the reinvestment period, but
subsequent inflows were considerably less than normal.

At both institutions, the average December-January experience
(shown in the last line of the table) was somewhat less favorable than
in the similar 1965-66 period. This comparison should not be taken to
imply that the nonbank institutions in early 1968 will necessarily
face the kinds of pressures existing in the similar period of 1966.
Fragmentary data suggest that some improvement in saving flows from
the greatly reduced December-January pace is likely in February.
During the first fifteen days of the month, the fifteen largest mutual
savings banks in New York City reported net inflows nearly as large as
in the same period of 1967, and double those of February 1966. Data
are not available for S&L's, but the staffs of both the FHLBB and U.S.
Savings and Loan League suggest that February inflows probably will
show somewhat more than the normal rebound from January. This impres-
sion tends to be supported by the commercial bank experience discussed
above. Thus, while indications appear to buttress industry views that
end-of-year savings experience was not as bad as feared--and apparently
was not sustained--it still remains evident that market interest rates
have risen to a point where they are significantly diverting individual
savings flows.
Despite the January savings outflows, not all of the S&L's
experiences were negative. Some areas of the South and the Northwest
recorded inflows. Moreover, in some other areas the January experience
could be explained in part by special local situations and factors.
Associations in Indiana, for example, were affected adversely by a
change in state law, effective January 1, which permitted commercial

III -7
banks to offer 3-month consumer certificates of deposit at 5 per cent,
as opposed to the previous ceiling of 4 per cent. In California, the
lower rate ceilings instituted last July by the FHLBB probably con-
tributed to reinvestment period outflows in that area.
Savings and loan associations weathered the January experi-
ence with little difficulty because of their ample preparation for it.
Share capital outflows were reflected in drawdowns in S&L holdings of
cash and Treasury securities, but their net liquidity position remained
relatively comfortable. Borrowings by the S&L's were not a net source
of funds in January, as a modest increase in advances from the FHLBB
system was more than counterbalanced by repayments of a large portion
of their December borrowing from commercial banks.
Mortgage market developments. Over-all conditions in the
residential mortgage market, which had been tightening for some time
prior to year end, apparently have changed little further since then.
In early February, some savings and loan associations in a few areas
eased their lending terms slightly, as aggregate savings outflows
during January proved to be less of a drain on resources than had been
anticipated. Through February 22, weekly offerings to FNMA of Govern-
ment underwritten loans in the secondary mortgage market edged down,
partly reflecting the continued reduced volume of primary-market
originations at this normally slack season for real estate activity in
many localities.

III -8
During January, average rates on conventional new-home
mortgages rose slightly further in the primary market, according to
the FHA series. They attained a new postwar high which was 5 basis.
points above the previous peaks reached last December and in November
of 1966. Within the more sensitive secondary market, on the other
hand, yields on certain FHA home mortgages remained unchanged at the
record level reattained a month earlier. Increases in home mortgage
yields were limited by the deep discounts already being required on
many loans. The 27-basis-point decline in yields on new issues of
high-grade corporate bonds in January produced a further recovery in
yield spreads favoring home mortgages over such bonds, as the table
shows, although spreads were still well below earlier standards.

Demand for home-mortgages during January was limited by the
seasonally low number of real estate transactions and the large dis-
counts (or points) often associated with high yielding mortgages
carrying contract rates of 6 per cent--the statutory ceiling on all
FHA and VA mortgages and on conventional loans in 9 states. Such dis-
counts--averaging 6.8 points on FHA loans--have continued to deter
some would-be sellers from placing houses on the market, inasmuch as
home sellers nominally must ordinarily absorb all but 1.0 point of any
mortgage discount, besides paying any real estate brokerage fees
involved.
Reports from the just completed Federal Reserve Bank and
Federal Home Loan Bank mortgage market survey--summarized in the
document accompanying the Greenbook--indicate that total new commit-
ments on residential mortgages have generally been running moderately
below normal for this time of year. Over the next three months, the
prospect appears to be for no marked change beyond the usual sharp
seasonal rise. One reason often cited for the recent below-normal
pace of new commitments--has been the already large backlog of older
commitments yet to be taken down. For those mortgage-oriented thrift
institutions which submit reports, aggregate outstanding residential
mortgage commitments changed little between November and January, as
the table shows, remaining slightly above their December 1965 level
when outlays for new private residential construction were averaging
close to the rate reached in recent months.

Outstanding residential mortgage commitments of the more
diversified life insurance companies have continued considerably below
their end-of-1965 volume. This has reflected a sharp drop-off in new
residential mortgage commitments--especially on homes--in favor of
commercial mortgage loans, direct placements, and purchases of bonds
in the open market. During the fourth quarter of 1967, new residential
mortgage commitments of reporting life insurance companies were nearly
a third below the fourth quarter of 1965. A more detailed discussion
of life insurance company activity in the fourth quarter can be found
in Appendix A.
Corporate and municipal bond markets. Yields on new
corporate and municipal bonds have advanced since early in February,
but at current levels yields in both markets remain below the 1967

III -11
highs reached in early December. In the corporate market, the upward
yield adjustment appears to have been in reaction to overly aggressive
bidding by underwriters on several utility issues earlier. Interest
rate pressures were more marked in the municipal market however.
Unlike the corporate market, where the calendar of new issues is
abating, the volume of new municipal issues remains large. Moreover,
there has also been an apparent slackening in bank purchases of munici-
pals during recent weeks.

A sizable part of corporate underwriter's optimism,
reflected in their new issue bidding, arose out of the reduced February
calendar of scheduled public bond offerings. As noted, however, such
optimism was not fully shared by investors. The calendar failed to
build up significantly as the month progressed and the ultimate volume
of public bond issues is estimated at $760 million, somewhat below
earlier estimates. This places February offerings below January as
well as below the comparable month a year ago. With private placements
estimated at $700 million, however, total bond and stock issues are
expected to aggregate over $1.6 billion in February, slightly above a
year earlier.

To date, the March calendar of scheduled public bond offer-
ings remains very light at $485 million. This volume is expected to
be supplemented by later additions to the calendar, but still the
total volume may be only about $675 million. Thus, March is likely
to represent the third consecutive month-to-month decline in these
offerings. It should be noted that the March volume of issues could
rise above current expectations, however, if corporate borrowers
accelerate their debt financing plans in an attempt to catch an appar-
ent void in the March calendar. Nevertheless, a likely rise in private
placements and new stock issues (primarily due to two large utility
offerings) will bring total bond and stock issues to about $1.9 billion,
in line with recent months.
State and local government bond offerings during February
are estimated to aggregate $1.2 billion, slightly above January and
about equal to February 1967. This volume has not been fully absorbed
by investors, however, as numerous issues remain in syndicate; dealers'
advertised inventories have advanced about $100 million since mid-
month. A drop-off in bank demand for these securities--relative to
earlier in the year--apparently accounts for part of the weakness in
the municipal market.

But in addition to purely technical factors and somewhat
reduced bank demand, the large prospective volume of municipal issues
has acted to dampen the enthusiasm of market participants for new
issues at current yields. The estimated volume of March municipal
offerings is again in excess of $1 billion. This brings the first
quarter volume to nearly $3.5 billion, second only to the unusually
large volume in the first quarter of 1967.
Corporate profits. Corporate profits before taxes appear
to have increased much more than had been expected from the third to
the fourth quarter of last year and may have equaled the previous all-
time record reached in the third and fourth quarters of 1966. The
increase reflected entirely a sharp rise in profits for the manufactur-
ing sector, as indicated by published earnings data for 570 large
companies that account for 60 per cent of the profits of all manufac-
turing corporations.

III -15
Profits in the motor vehicle and nonferrous metals groups
were well below year-earlier totals, because of strikes within these
industries, but earnings in almost every other major manufacturing
industry were as large or larger in the fourth quarter of 1967 than
in the same quarter of 1966. For all manufacturing, profits are
estimated to have increased about 2 per cent. This is only a small
increase, but it contrasts with declines earlier in the year and
implies a rise of 15 per cent in seasonally adjusted manufacturing
profits before tax from the third to the fourth quarter. (Profits
data for separate manufacturing industries are not available on a
seasonally adjusted basis--hence the use of year-to-year rather than
quarter-to-quarter comparisons.)
Total corporate profits, it should be noted, declined
nearly 5 per cent between the fourth quarter of 1966 and the third
quarter of 1967, and the decline centered in manufacturing industries.
Thus, even though earnings of nonmanufacturing groups as a whole
probably changed little in the fourth quarter of 1967, recovery of
manufacturing profits sharply reversed the trend in total profits.
Stock market. Between mid-January and mid-February, common
stock prices declined sharply. Although the market then turned up
again, the subsequent "recovery" as of late February still appeared to
be largely technical. A 5 per cent decline in New York Stock Exchange
short interest between mid-January and mid-February, and corresponding
10 per cent decline in American Exchange short interest, suggests that

III -16
some short sellers believed the prices of their stocks were near
bottom. Nonetheless, the mid-February short interest remained rela-
tively high.

While the less seasoned stocks, as represented by the
American Exchange index, are now farthest from their mid-January
high's, the declines have not been concentrated in any specific indus-
cries. This across-the-board re-evaluation of stock values would imply
that the factors affecting the market have been general ones--most
probably uncertainty regarding public policy and international develop-
ments.
January data for margin debt (a series increasingly more
reliable than customers' net debit balances) show that during the
market decline, broker and dealer margin customers sold some of their
holdings. Although bank purpose loans to others than brokers and
dealers were unchanged at about $2.4 billion, margin debt in January
declined by $160 million--offsetting 10 per cent of the increase over
1967 as a whole. This was the largest such decline since September
1965. At the same time, reflecting declining stock values and customer
sales, collateral values associated with outstanding margin debt
declined about $1.0 billion, or 5 per cent. The proportion of debt in
accounts with equity status of 40 per cent or less, however, was vir-
tually unchanged at 10 per cent, and thus the decline in stock prices
did not increase the general vulnerability of margin accounts to calls.
U.S. Government securities market. Yields on short-term
Treasury securities have risen on balance since early February, but
yields on Treasury obligations maturing in 5 years or more have changed
little, as the table shows.

The recent advance in Treasury bill rates has occurred
against a background of rising dealer financing costs and expectations
of further tightening of money market rates following completion of
the Treasury's February financings. The Treasury sale of over $4
billion new 15-month notes on February 13 added to supply pressures
in short-term debt markets. Investment demand for short-term issues
has remained generally good but dealers have recently become more
willing sellers of bills,even at rising yields, following a substantial
build-up in their inventories over the course of January. The Treasury
announcement on February 20 of renewed $100 million cash additions to
the weekly 3-month bill auction contributed to the cautious tone in the
market.

III -19
The note and bond sector of the market, influenced by a
variety of cross currents, held generally steady over the first 3 weeks
of February. Among the factors affecting the market were continued
uncertainties created by developments in the Far East, growing talk
about a move toward tighter monetary policy, a diminished calendar of
new corporate issues, and the feeling that a worsening of the situation
in Vietnam would enhance prospects for a tax increase. Against this
background, the Treasury successfully completed its February financing
operations, as it sold to private investors some $3.8 billion of new
7-year notes and $4.1 billion of new 15-month notes. Both new issues
performed well in the secondary market, though they have declined from
their best price levels in recent trading sessions. Bank selling of
the new 15-month notes, the bulk of which were alloted to banks per-
mitted to pay for the issues through 100 per cent tax and loan account
credit, appears to have been relatively light. Dealers were willing
underwriters of the new issues and most recently held in position some
$440 million of securities due in more than 1 year, presumably mostly
the new notes. These positions represented a decline from peak hold-
ings of $515 million on February 20.
Yields on short-term market instruments other than bills
have generally edged up since early February as the following table
indicates.

Federal Budget. New staff projections of Federal fiscal opera-
tions show a seasonally unadjusted cash deficit of $3.6 billion in the
first half of calendar 1968. This measure of the deficit includes
privately owned government-sponsored corporations in the Federal sector,
and treats sales of participation certificates as financing.
The new estimate contrasts sharply with the large fiscal sur-
pluses usually realized in the January-June period and also contrasts
with the exact half-year balance between receipts and outlays implied
by the January Budget Document when measured on the same basis.

privately-owned government sponsored corporations.
2/ Differs from old cash borrowing by inclusion of participation
certificate borrowing, plus accrued interest on Treasury bills
and savings bonds. Agrees with flow-of-funds concept of Federal
obligations.

III -22
The increase in the expected deficit relative to the Budget
Document results from three factors:
(1) Surtax revenues of $1.9 billion were assumed in the
President's budget, but none are assumed in the current projection.
(2) Staff estimates of cash receipts other than from the
surtax are $1 billion smaller than in the Budget, despite roughly
similar income assumptions.
(3) Spending estimates for the January-June period are $0.7
billion higher than in the Budget, reflecting both higher estimates
for defense outlays and larger borrowing demands on the Home Loan Bank
System by savings and loan associations.
These staff estimates are consistent with the GNP projection
presented earlier in the Greenbook. The corresponding deficit in the
NIA Federal sector amounts to $9.4 and $12.5 billion in the first and
second quarters of 1968, as measured on a seasonally adjusted annual
rate basis.
The new staff estimate indicates a need for larger gross
cash borrowing by the Federal sector over the remaining four months of
the fiscal year than the market currently appears to expect. In addi-
tion to the already announced $1.2 billion still to be added to the
cycle of 90-day Treasury bills and the $2.0 billion or so generally
expected in further participation certificate offerings to the public,
the new projection would require a minimum additional cash borrowing
of roughly $2.5 billion as the table shows. This estimate assumes

III -23
that the Treasury cash balance at the end of June would drop to $4
billion. A mid-year balance at this level would be unusually low,
however, and would probably require overdrafts with the Federal
Reserve System prior to the receipt of June tax payments. Moreover,
since the Budget always experiences a large seasonal deficit in the
early weeks of July, a Treasury balance as low as $4.0 billion at
mid-year would necessitate sizable further cash borrowing early in
fiscal 1969.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
U.S. balance of payments. Preliminary information indicates
that the January deficit on the liquidity basis was about $125 million
(not seasonally adjusted). Known transactions in near-liquid foreign
official assets included the German acquisition of another $125 million
of medium-term DM bonds under the 1967 agreement, a total of $60 mil-
lion of various other smaller acquisitions of near-liquid assets, and
the redemption of $200 million of U.S.-dollar Roosa bonds for Canada.
Before these special transactions, which do not affect either the U.S.
deficit on the official reserve transaction basis or the reserves of
the foreign countries concerned, our January deficit on the liquidity
basis was about $110 million.
In the first three weeks of February the unadjusted liquidity
deficit was about $125 million. As the first quarter of the year is a
seasonally favorable period, large upward adjustments are required in
assessing the deficit. The first-quarter seasonal adjustments in the
four years 1963-66 averaged nearly $600 million. (In 1967 a shift in
timing of certain oil company tax payments from April to March oc-
casioned a smaller adjustment.) While monthly variations are too
erratic to permit an allocation of the adjustment to separate months
of the quarter, it is evident that the rate of deficit thus far this
year, before or after the special transactions mentioned above, should
be thought of as corresponding to a seasonally adjusted annual rate in
the $2-1/2 billion to $4 billion range rather than anything lower.

IV -2
The trade surplus in January was at an annual rate of only
$1.3 billion, far below the $4.3 billion average of the first three
quarters of 1967. Since the over-all deficit on the liquidity basis
before special transactions was running at a $4 billion annual rate
in the first three quarters of 1967, it is clear that the worsening
on trade account since then has been offset by sharp reduction of
net payments on some other accounts.
Reports under the Foreign Credit Restraint Program indicate
that bank claims on foreigners were reduced in January by about $200
million, a more than seasonal amount but somewhat less than in
January 1967.
On the official reserve transactions basis the balance in
January and the first three weeks of February appears to have been a
surplus, without seasonal adjustment. The difference between the two
measures of the deficit for this period reflects primarily the large
inflow of foreign private liquid funds through the expansion of
liabilities of U.S. banks to their foreign branches.
U.S. foreign trade. An export surplus in U.S. merchandise
trade reappeared in January, following the drop to an import surplus
in December 1967 as measured on the balance of payments basis (which
excludes military exports). At a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
$1.3 billion, the January surplus was still below the very low fourth
quarter rate of $1.5 billion.
Exports in January increased by 11 per cent over the
December value to an annual rate of $32.6 billion (balance of

IV -3
payments basis). This compares with an annual rate of $29.9 billion
in the fourth quarter of 1967 and $30.5 billion for the entire year
of 1967.
Both agricultural and nonagricultural exports rose from
December to January. The 15 per cent gain in agricultural shipments
accounted for about one-fourth of the total export rise; the remainder
of the increase was accounted for by a 10 per cent advance in non-
agricultural exports.
Manufacturers' export orders for nonelectric machinery,
which had slipped in the third quarter of 1967, rose sharply in the
last two months of last year, giving promise of an advance in exports
of these products in the coming months.
By areas, shipments to Asia-Africa increased sharply,
accounting for about two-thirds of the total rise in exports in
January. More moderate gains were recorded in exports to Canada
and Japan. Shipments to Western Europe, which had declined sharply
in the fourth quarter, showed little further change in January and
have not yet responded to the economic upturn in Europe.
Imports in January climbed to a new high for the third
successive month. In January, imports were at an annual rate of
$31.4 billion, compared with $28.4 billion in the fourth quarter
of 1967 and a $26.4 billion average for the preceding three quarters.
About one-half of the increase from December to January is accounted
for by exceptionally heavy arrivals of refined copper and a more
modest rise in steel imports. As mentioned in the last Green Book,

IV -4
the increasingly large imports of these two commodities in recent months
stem from domestic shortages caused by the long-continued copper strike
and from anticipation of an interruption of domestic steel supplies
this summer. A portion of the remaining increase in January imports
may reflect a rise in dutiable imports resulting from the first phase
of the Kennedy Round of tariff reductions which became effective on
January 1.
Travel promotion. The Industry-Government Special Task Force
on Travel has sent its report to the President, suggesting measures
that could increase foreign travel in the U.S. and narrow the foreign
travel gap. The Task Force has initiated actions which, with the
support of Federal Agencies and private industry, should lead to a
substantial reduction in cost of travel by foreign visitors to the
U.S. Steps are already being taken to reduce domestic air fares,
railroad fares, hotel and motel rates, car rental charges and package
tour prices for foreign travelers. International air carriers and
steamship lines serving the North Atlantic are seeking approval of
low-cost directional fares to the U.S.
To encourage foreign travel to the U.S., the 1968 budgets
of U.S. travel-related businesses and associations for promotion,
advertising, and sales abroad have been increased.

IV -5
The balance of payments and Treasury debt management. The
following table, showing changes in various types of U.S. liquid and near-
liquid liabilities to foreign official accounts, is designed to bring
out certain Treasury debt management aspects of U.S. balance of payments
financing last year. During 1967 the balance of payments deficit on the
official reserve transactions basis was $3.4 billion. The U.S. gold
stock decreased by $1.2 billion, while Federal Reserve and Treasury hold-
ings of convertible foreign currencies increased by $1.0 billion and our
IMF gold tranche position increased by $0.1 billion. Reserve liabilities
rose by $3.3 billion, with the changes in composition shown by the table.
It will be seen that foreign official holdings of U.S. Government securities
increased by over £2.2 billion. This reduced the Treasury's needs for
placing securities with domestic investors considerably.
About $500 million of the foreign official lending to the U.S.
Government was via marketable securities (lines 3 and 4 of the table). Out-
standing nonconvertible dollar Roosa bonds increased by somewhat over $150
million (line 7), and outstanding foreign currency issues by nearly $350
million (lines 9-11). The largest single item of change in 1967 was the
$1.2 billion increase in short-term special (nonmarketable) dollar certificates
of indebtedness (line 5), the great bulk of which occurred in the fourth
quarter.
The table follows the present balance of payments accounting pro-
cedures in not counting nonguaranteed Agency securities as U.S. reserve lia-
bilities. Since the British liquidation of their official security portfolio
involved a considerable amount of running off of maturing Agency securities,
the net assistance the Treasury obtained in its domestic debt management was
actually somewhat less than indicated in the preceding paragraphs.

In the current quarter, with the balance of payments in surplus
on the official reserve transactions basis (not seasonally adjusted), the
implications for Treasury debt management are unfavorable.
Last year's favorable impact of balance of payments financing
on Treasury debt management happened to work almost entirely through
foreign acquisitions of U.S. Government securities, as U.S. gold sales
were balanced by additions to U.S. official holdings of convertible curren-
cies. But if there had been net losses of U.S. reserve assets, that would
also have reduced Treasury needs for placing securities with private
domestic investors, in so far as Federal Reserve open market purchases
would have offset the effects on member bank reserves of the gold and
convertible currency transactions. (Incidentally, it may be noted that
foreign commercial banks and other private persons are ordinarily not
large investors in U.S. Government securities.)
Reserve changes of major countries. Net official reserves of
most of the G-10 countries fell in January. For nine countries other
than Britain and the United States -- Switzerland being the eleventh of
the Ten -- net official reserves declined by nearly $1.2 billion, as may
be seen in the last column of the second table on page IV-9. Canadian
and Japanese reserves accounted for a third of this decrease. The $0.8
billion decrease in net official reserves of EEC countries and Switzerland
was in part a seasonal phenomenon; in any event it largely reflected out-
flows of commercial bank funds from these countries. German commercial banks'
net foreign assets rose in January by $733 million. Swiss banks reportedly
reinvested abroad all or most of the funds they had repatriated in December.

IV -8
The two tables on the next page, based on partly unpublished
and confidential data, show net reserve changes for the nine countries
during 1966 and 1967 (in the lower table) and combined changes in their
official reserves and commercial bank external net assets (in the upper
table). These latter combined figures are the counterpart of surpluses (or
deficits) on current, long-term capital, domestic nonbanks' short-term
capital, and errors-and-omissions accounts in the balance of payments.
On this basis, the EEC countries had a $1.5 billion balance of payments
surplus in 1967, up from $1.2 billion in 1966. Japan had a deficit of
$0.6 billion, and Canada a surplus of $0.4 billion.
In the EEC balance of payments there were small deficits in the
fourth quarters of both 1966 and 1967, for seasonal and other reasons. One
special factor in 1967 was the unusually large private purchases of gold
by resident speculators and hoarders in November and December, mainly in
the London gold market. To the extent that the purchasers were moving
out of assets in their own currencies, they had to acquire dollars from
their central banks.
Speculative movements from Britain or elsewhere into German
mark deposits at German banks and into French franc deposits at French
banks would not count as reducing the German and French deficits on the
basis used here (upper table), since the resulting accruals to reserves
would be balanced by increases in commercial bank liabilities. Such
speculative flows may, however, have been a significant factor tending to
enlarge the fourth-quarter official reserve gains (lower table). The
total (gross) increase during the fourth quarter in German banks' DM lia-
bilities to nonresidents, reflecting these and other flows, was $367 million;
and the corresponding franc figure for French banks was $110 million.

The temporary fourth-quarter balance of payments deficit of
the EEC countries as a group was apparently reversed in January. The
combined changes in official reserves and banks' net assets (upper table)
indicate a considerable deficit for Italy again in January, but a very
large surplus for Germany. (Data for other countries are not yet available.)
These developments were partly seasonal.
The German surplus in January of about $530 million counter-
balanced the seasonal deficit of December, which was about $550 million.
For the four months October-January, as the table shows, Germany had a
balance of payments surplus of about $300 million. Thus, despite the sharp
rise in German imports in recent months, export earnings have been large
enough and outpayments for services, unilateral transfers, and capital
flows have been small enough to produce a continuing large surplus. German
industrial production rose sharply in December, and the November-December
average was 9 per cent above the low level of the first half of 1967.
Imports, which had begun to rise last spring and summer, increased sharply
in November and December, averaging in those months 11 per cent above the
first half of 1967.
The German surplus in the past year has not produced cumulative
official reserve gains, only because monetary conditions in Germany have
been so easy as to stimulate large short-term investments and loans abroad
by the German commercial banks. Since the beginning of 1968 the Bundesbank
has not been offering preferential rates on dollar-DM swaps to stimulate
such outflows, but has rather been endeavoring to get the banks to enlarge
their holdings of domestic money market paper and securities. Nevertheless,

IV -11
the banks' net external assets increased by $733 million in January --
partly in dollar assets, partly in DM net assets. The Bundesbank's swaps
with the German banks increased by $223 million in the first two days of
January, apparently reflecting contracts made at the end of December.
Since then, the outstanding swaps have been gradually reduced: from a
peak of $854 million they were down to about $700 million on February 20.
Italy's deficit in the four months October-January, as measured
in the upper table on page IV-9, totaled about $120 million. This is a
seasonally unfavorable period, with receipts from tourists low, and does
not necessarily imply a change from annual surpluses (about $560 million
in 1966 and about $370 million in 1967) to deficit in 1968. However, the
trade balance appears to have been somewhat more unfavorable in recent
months than a year earlier. In October and November this development was
offset by a shift (dating from last summer) in leads and lags in trade
payments, a shift which undoubtedly reflected precautions traders were
taking against devaluations of sterling and other currencies of the sterling
area. In December and January this temporarily favorable factor was no
longer present.
The French balance of payments position appears to be close to
balance. For the year 1967 as a whole the surplus as measured in the
table was small. The fourth-quarter deficit of a little over $100 million
is more than fully explained by two special factors: heavy gold buying
on the London market by French residents, reportedly at least $80 million;
and conversion by Algeria of $95 million of its franc holdings to buy gold.
French imports and exports have both been rising, and apart from seasonal

IV -12
variations the trade deficit has not changed much over the past year
and a half.
The $240 million increase in French official reserves in the
fourth quarter of 1967, despite the payments deficit in that quarter,
was the result of an even larger decline in the commercial banks' net
external asset position. In addition to the $110 million increase mentioned
earlier in their franc liabilities, the banks' foreign currency liabilities
increased by $530 million while their foreign currency assets rose by only
$300 million.
Sweden's underlying balance of payments position appears still
to be one of surplus, despite the deficit ($125 million) and large loss
of reserves ($180 million) registered in the fourth quarter (see tables
on page IV-9). In the wake of the devaluation of sterling in mid-November
there was a wave of speculation against the Swedish krona. After a
severe drain of reserves, the Bank of Sweden raised discount rate from
5 to 6 per cent on December 15, and tightened some credit regulations.
Speculation subsided thereafter, and the discount rate was reduced to
5-1/2 per cent, effective February 9.
The Japanese balance of payments moved into deficit last year,
as imports continued to rise strongly while exports were leveling out.
In the seasonally unfavorable month of January this year the deficit
was $280 million, much larger than in other recent Januarys. However,
seasonally adjusted exports rose sharply in January, no doubt reflecting
the recent advances in import buying in the United States and Europe,
and this will tend to arrest the deterioration in the balance.

IV -13
The Japanese payments deficit in 1967 was covered in large
part by a $510 million increase in the commercial banks' net foreign
liabilities. While the banks' foreign assets, primarily in dollars,
rose by $440 million, their liabilities increased by $950 million, also
mainly in dollars -- partly in liabilities to U.S. banks and partly in
Euro-dollar borrowings.
The recent easing in Euro-dollar rates has attracted Japanese
banks to that market, particularly in view of Japan's present tight
money policy. The government's informal ceilings on Euro-dollar
borrowings by the banks were raised in January, to allow net borrowing
of $45 million during the first quarter, in place of the $30 million
originally announced.
In February, the Japanese Government arranged for a DM 100
million ($25 million) bond issue in Germany.
Canada's balance of payments surplus, on the basis defined
by the upper table on page IV-9, increased toward the end of 1967 as
the result mainly of a strong rise in exports. Official reserve changes
were relatively small throughout 1967. The commercial banks, however,
made a substantial addition to their external U.S.-dollar assets,
placed partly in the United States and partly in the Euro-dollar market.
In January, the official reserves fell about $350 million in
consequence of speculation against the Canadian dollar after the an-
nouncement of the U.S. balance of payments program. Canadian domestic
political uncertainties have prolonged the pressures on the Canadian
dollar. Data are not yet available on additions to commercial bank
external assets in January.

IV -14
Britain's gold and foreign exchange reserves, as publicly
reported, fell from $2,794 million at the end of October (the last pre-
devaluation date for which a reserve figure was given) to $2,748 million
at the end of January. Deducting from the latter figure the $490 million
the U.K. Treasury added to its reserves in November from the sale of its
remaining holdings of U.S. securities, the decline was almost 20 per cent.
Another major transaction publicly acknowledged was the payment
of $220 million in December on loans made to the U.K. by the U.S. and
Canada in the early post-war period. Earlier, in November, Britain
paid off the remaining $250 million of the IMF drawing of December 1964,
but this repayment was effected with a $250 million loan arranged through
the BIS and so left Britain's reserve position unchanged.
The implication of the above figures would seem to be that
other payments from the reserves in the three months November-January
totalled about $320 million. However, the actual outflow, apart from
foreign central bank assistance, greatly exceeded this amount.
In November, the reserves, as officially reported, declined
by $363 million before inclusion of the $490 million obtained from the
securities portfolio. The loss would have been considerably greater
but for foreign central bank assistance. Since there was a substantial
reflux into sterling after November 18, the drain in the first part of
the month was massive. This drain reflected, of course, not only specu-
lative movements of funds but also the deficit on current transactions.
The merchandise trade deficit alone amounted to about $850 million during
the fourth quarter.

IV -15
In December, the true reserve loss was again in excess of the
officially reported $240 million decrease. Temporary weakening of con-
fidence in the new par value of the pound necessitated considerable Bank
of England support in the spot market in the early and middle part of
the month.
In January, with confidence in the pound relatively firm, the
reserves were officially reported to have increased by $53 million. Since
there was a small decrease in the amount of central bank assistance out-
standing during the month, the authorities placed themselves in the novel
position of having understated a gain. During the month, the Bank of
England took in a very large volume of spot dollars, but paid most of it
out again to meet maturing forward contracts. The bulk of the dollar in-
flow apparently stemmed from purchases of sterling by the holders of the
maturing forwards, to use in meeting their side of the contracts.
Thus far in February, payments by the Bank of England on forward
contracts made in the weeks immediately before the devaluation are reported
to have slightly exceeded the Bank's dollar intake.
The ease in the Euro-dollar market in January and February may
have been partly associated with sterling developments. In particular,
holders of maturing forward contracts may have placed their dollar profits
in Euro-dollar deposits. The covered differential between 90-day Euro-
dollar and local authority deposits has narrowed, but remained in favor
of the former until this week.
Geographical breakdown of U.S. reserve liability changes. Of
the $3.3 billion increase in U.S. liquid and near-liquid liabilities to
foreign official accounts in 1967, $0.5 billion was to the United Kingdom

IV -16
and was the counterpart of the U.K. Government's liquidation of its
security portfolio to build up U.K. monetary reserves.
The net increase in liabilities to EEC monetary authorities
was over $1.3 billion. The total net increase to all continental
European monetary authorities was about $2.1 billion, including about
$350 million increase in U.S. Government securities denominated in foreign
currencies. Much of the $1.75 billion increase in dollar liabilities to
continental Europe was covered by use of swap drawings initiated by the
Federal Reserve, the increase in which over the year was $1.5 billion (see
memo item in the table on page IV-6). In the first quarter of last year
total U.S. liabilities to continental European monetary authorities de-
creased somewhat, following the usual seasonal pattern. In each of the
next three quarters there was a substantial increase. The fourth-quarter
increase was somewhat smaller than those of the preceding quarters, perhaps
partly for seasonal reasons.
Liabilities to Canadian official accounts classed as liquid
showed little change over the year. Canada acquired $200 million of non-
liquid U.S.-dollar-denominated Roosa bonds -- subsequently liquidated in
January 1968.
Liquid liabilities to the monetary authorities of Japan, Latin
America, and the rest of the world decreased by about $150 million, while
their holdings of over-1-year time deposits increased by $900 million,
mainly in the first half of the year. This group of countries has not
acquired Roosa bonds.

IV- 17
Composition of EEC reserve gains. The following table sum-
marizes confidential BIS data on the composition of the official net
reserve gains of the EEC countries in 1967 and January 1968. The totals
are the same as in the lower table of page IV-9.

Although the increase in these countries' net official reserves
during the four months October-January was under $100 million, their hold-
ings of foreign exchange and miscellaneous reserve assets increased by
about $550 million, as may be seen in the fifth line of the table. Gold
sales, repayments of their currencies to the IMF by other countries, and
a net increase in their official liabilities made this possible. In the
fourth quarter alone the rise in foreign exchange and miscellaneous reserve
asset holdings was over $900 million. In the first three quarters of 1967
such holdings had increased by about $1,050 million. These figures of
course include increases in claims on the United States. Our data show
increases in U.S. reserve liabilities to the EEC countries of about $550
million in the fourth quarter and $780 million in the preceding three
quarters, totalling over $1.3 billion as mentioned on page IV-16.

they accounted for only one half their 1966 share of total commitments.
In dollar amounts, the 1967 totals fell $0.5 billion below the 1966
level of $1.3 billion. This striking curtailment reflected mainly the
narrowing yield spread between 1-to 4-family mortgages and other in-
vestments through most of the year. It also reflected the increased
desire to avoid transactions in government-underwritten mortgages at
the deep discounts that have once again become necessary to secure a
competitive yield.
Under these circumstances both corporate securities and the
dominant non-residential mortgage group appear to have shared in the
additional funds thus made available. Moreover, the share of new
commitments allocated to business and industrial bonds in the fourth
quarter as a whole remained above that of recent years, although in
December, contrary to trend, these commitments represented an unusually
small share of total new commitments.
The December decline in new commitments for corporate securi-
ties may reflect both an abatement of corporate demands for funds and
changing yield differentials. Although yield differentials between
income property mortgages and corporate private placements were
narrowed to the advantage of private placements in the fourth quarter,
this in turn was accompanied by an unusual narrowing of the yield
differential between privately-placed and publicly-offered corporate
securities, with a consequent reduction in the historic appeal of
private placements over public issues. (Although the confidential
private placement yield series is only approximate, the yield differen-
tials it helps to imply can generally be given some significance.)
However, the decline in yields on publicly offered new issues since mid-
December may have begun to reverse this development. Yield comparisons
can be found in the table on the next page.
In 1967, there was an unusually large rate of acquisition of
corporate securities by life insurance companies. Most of these
acquisitions were made in the public market. But with forward commit-
ments for privately placed issues rising sharply after their decline
in 1966, the stock of commitments outstanding on corporate private
placements reached record levels during the fourth quarter -- despite
changing yield differentials. This suggests that, as these commit-
ments mature, the volume of funds supplies by life insurance companies
to corporations will continue to be relatively large -- but increasingly
through the private placement market.

APPENDIX B: POPULATION CHANGES*
Basic demographic trends which have characterized the period
since 1957 continued in 1967. The birth rate continued to decline,
the death rate remained stable at a low level, and the net civilian
immigration rate was at the higher end of the relatively narrow
range within which it has fluctuated in the postwar years. With rela-
tive stability in two of the components of population growth, the
further reduction in the birth rate was reflected in a somewhat lower
rate of growth in the total population in the year ending January 1, 1968
than in the year before. The net addition to the population last year
was 30 per cent less than the peak of 3,058,000 in 1956.

Marriage rates have been rising sharply however, and are
expected to show further gains as the population of marriageable age
increases. This, in turn, should be reflected in a rise in birth
rates and a faster rate of growth in the population.
Births. The birth rate decreased again in 1967 marking
the tenth year of decline. There were 3.6 million children born last
year, 75,000 fewer than in 1966, and the rate of births per 1,000
population dropped to 17.9 from 18.4 the year before. The birth rate
has fallen from more than 25 per 1,000 population to below the rate
of the depression years of the 1930's since the downtrend began in
1958. In part, the decline reflects the smaller proportion of women
in the childbearing ages in recent years. The fertility rate (which
measures the number of births per 1,000 women 15 to 44 years) continued
well above the low levels of the mid-1930's. In fact, the rate of
decline in the fertility rate slowed somewhat between 1966 and 1967.
Birth rates for first, second and higher order children are not yet
available for 1967, but data for 1966 showed an increase in the number
and the rate of first births. This rise reflects the increasing
number of recently married young women, and suggests that some women
decided to have children they postponed when first married.
Marriages. The marriage rate rose in 1967 to 9.7 per 1,000
population. The number of marriages totaled more than 1.9 million,
close to half a million more than the postwar low in 1958. This was
the fifth successive year of increase and the highest rate in the
past 14 years. The 1967 rate, however, was still substantially below
the high rates of the World War II years and the postwar peak of 16.4
reached in 1946.

The current upswing in the marriage rate followed 5 years
of stability (from 1958-1962) at the very low level of 8.5 per 1,000
population. A number of factors have contributed to the rise since
1963. Exemption of married men from the draft between the end of
1962 and late 1965 undoubtedly contributed to the rise in the number
of marriages during this period. However, the main thrust has app-
arently come from the continued expansion in job opportunities for the
18 to 24 year group where most first marriages occur.
Outlook. For some years now, the burgeoning in the young
adult population, abundant job opportunities and rising wages and
salaries have led to the anticipation of an end to the downtrend in
the birth rate. Expectations of a reversal in this trend were further
heightened as the marriage rate continued its climb from the low
plateau of the late 50's and early 60's. The further decline in the
birth rate in 1967 emphasized again that an increase in the number of
married couples is not necessarily a harbinger of a subsequent rise
in births. The new methods of birth control and their greater availa-
bility through extensive family planning programs have undoubtedly
played a part in this decline. Many young married couples apparently
continued to postpone starting a family. Various reasons are offered
for this postponement. The tight labor market of recent years has
afforded exceptional job opportunities for women, and their continued
employment after marriage has added significantly to family income.
It has permitted the satisfaction of desires for home ownership, the
purchase of household durables, additional education, and travel
before settling down to raise a family. Recently, there has also
been the unsettling effect of the war in Vietnam either by actual
separation of couples or anticipation of such a possibility.
It would seem, however, that after four years of substantial
increases in the number of young married couples, that the alternatives
to raising a family would be satisfied by enough couples to result in
a gradual upswing in the number of first births and be apparent in a
rise in the birth rate. Even the most "pessimistic", or lowest, of
the four Census Bureau projections of the future population, (which
utilized for its projection the lowest rates of fertility of this
century, excluding the depression years of the 30's), had assumed an
end to the declining trend in the number of births by the year ending
July 1, 1968, and a subsequent rise sufficient to increase the birth

B -4
rate by the early 1970's. In the next to lowest projection of the
future course of the fertility rate, the turn-around in the birth rate
was expected in 1967. Demographic forecasts have not been out-
standingly successful in the past in pinpointing turning points
in fertility trends, but this one should not be too far in the
future, particuarly in the light of recent marriage trends.
We are on considerably safer ground in anticipating a
continuation of the rise in the marriage rate. To the other
factors which have led to the rise in the marriage rate in recent
years: the continually mounting number of young persons in the 18
to 24 year group and the expectation of rapid growth in the economy,
will be added an increase in the number of college graduates this year.
There will be close to 700,000 young persons graduating from college
this June, about 17 per cent more than a year earlier. A larger than
usual rise will also occur in June of 1969. This exodus of young
persons from college into the tight labor market projected for this
year should give added impetus to the upward trend in marriages, and
result in an increase in new household formation with an attendant
rise in purchases of household goods and services.

CURRENT AND PROSPECTIVE CONDITIONS IN
THE RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE MARKET
as Reported in Special Surveys by the
Federal Reserve Banks and the Federal
Home Loan Banks
February 1968Confidential --FR

CURRENT AND PROSPECTIVE CONDITIONS IN THE
RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE MARKET AS REPORTED IN SPECIAL SURVEYS BY
THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS AND THE FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANKS*
As mortgage lenders generally expect that their savings and
cash flows will be slightly subnormal through May, they look for no basic
improvement in their new mortgage commitments on residential properties
above rates which were moderately below normal in early February. While
market uncertainties have apparently lessened since the fall, structural
problems have intensified in many areas to limit financing activity in
February more than they did last September, when an earlier survey was
made. Both the demand and supply sides of the market for new cnmmitments
on residential mortgages have been restrained by a large backlog of out-
standing commitments, deep mortgage discounts, below-market usury ceilings,
and attractive yields on alternative capital market instruments. On
balance, current demands for residential mortgage credit reportedly may
have about equaled, if not slightly exceeded, supplies of available funds
at current rates and terms.
These over-all findings, based on 438 lender interviews held
by the Federal Reserve Banks and the Federal Home Loan Banks in early
February, varied somewhat among different areas, as might be expected
from the localized nature of the primary residential mortgage market.
The timing of the surveys--coming during a seasonally low month for real

Section, on the basis of reports from the Federal Reserve Banks to
the Board's letter of January 17, 1968, and a summary prepared by

survey conducted by the Federal Home Loan banks of savings and loan
associations.

estate activity-undoubtedly complicated lender assessments of current
and prospective conditions in relation to normal levels of activity.
Nevertheless, a concensus seems clearly evident from the aggregate results.
Generally, lenders felt that new commitments would continue to be made on
home and apartment mortgages at a conservative pace through the spring,
although an active volume of loan disbursements may well be maintained
out of the large backlog of old commitments.
The survey results summarized below and tabulated at the end
of this report are based on Federal Reserve Bank interviews with 126
commercial banks, 64 mortgage companies, 56 life insurance companies,
and 28 mutual savings banks. Also included are Federal Home Loan Bank
interviews with 164 savings and loan associations, as tabulated by the
Federal Home Loan Bank Board. Identical questions were asked by the
Federal Reserve Banks and the Federal Home Loan banks. As in earlier
surveys, the findings reflect only the viewpoints of lenders. No inter-
views were held with brokers, builders, or would-be buyers and sellers
of residential real estate.
Current volume of new commitments
New commitments were generally being made on residential
mortgages during February in a volume that was moderately below normal
for the time of year. Moreover, all lender groups interviewed except
savings and loan associations were apparently making new commitments at
a somewhat less aggressive rate than they reported last September. Sharp
declines in new commitment volume since last fall were implied for such

typical long-distance lenders as savings banks and life insurance
companies. This was also the case for mortgage companies, which service
long-distance lenders by dealing chiefly in Government underwritten loans.
All Federal Reserve Districts reported a below-normal volume
of new commitments in February for lenders other than savings and loan
associations. By lender type, commercial banks were making new commitments
more actively than life insurance companies, mortgage companies, or savings
banks. Most market support was continuing to come from the traditional
mortgage specialists--savings and loan associations. Greater strength in
savings and loan lending activity was suggested by the fact that new
commitments for these institutions were reported as above-normal in
5 of the 12 Federal Home Loan Bank Districts, normal in 2, and below-
normal in 5.

Note: Percentages in this and following tables are based on all
reporting cases, which were especially small in number for savings
banks. Each response was weighted equally, without adjustment for
actual lending volume.

Restraints on normal new-commitment volume were widely reported
on the supply side as well as the demand side of the market. Included
among these was the already-advanced backlog of outstanding commitments.
0. this subject, the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia noted that
"two of the life insurance companies / interviewed_/ are fully committed
for 1968 and part of 1969 / in relation to their present cash flow
projections /. One other would be fully committed were it not for a
policy of spreading the allocation for residential mortgage commitments
over the calendar year."
Another widely-cited restraining factor was the deep discounts
on FHA and VA mortgages bearing contract interest rates at the 6 per cent
statutory limit. According to the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis,
"a contraction of FHA-VA volume as a result of below-market interest rate
ceilings on such mortgages appears to have had an important effect on the
volume of total commitments during this period. Commercial banks in the
western part of the Ninth District were especially emphatic on this point.
One Montana banker stated / that_/ speculative construction by contractors
is nil, because of relatively high FHA and VA discount rates rather than
reluctance of home purchasers to pay high interest rates.' Life insurance
companies, in general, report that they are completely out of the FHA-VA
market. Since local mortgage bankers are heavily dependent on funds from
life insurance companies, they also report a currently bearish picture
in the residential mortgage loan commitment area.
Even within the Federal Reserve District of Boston, where
mortgage conditions were easier than elsewhere, "the single most obvious
result of the market tightening which has occurred / since September_/ is

-5-
that each type of financial institution has tended to retrench some-
what in its over-all lending activities so that it can better insure an
uninterrupted flow of funds to its traditional sources of demand over
the coming months.
A third restraining factor was sub-market usury ceilings in
a number of States. The Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank indicated
that those / commercial_/ bankers doing less business than normal
generally cited two factors: (1) temporary (seasonal) lack of demand
and (2) 6 per cent usury ceiling and/or policy of not charging points
on a loan. For the most part, the usury constraint is most felt at those
banks offering ceiling rates on passbook and certificate savings.
Within the New York Federal Home Loan Bank District, "the
present volume of new commitments being made / by savings and loan associa-
tions_/ on residential properties is sharply below normal for this time
of year. The principal reason given is the 6 per cent limit on interest
rates under the usury laws ...most associations will entertain limited
requests only from mortgage sources of long standing. Mortgage funds
are being directed into the higher yielding bond and Government securities
market. Others have turned to out-of-state / mortgage_/ purchases and
have closed the mortgage window entirely to local mortgage applicants.
The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis indicated that new
commitments were sharply below normal in Tennessee, which has a usury
law limiting the maximum interest rate to 6 per cent on loans under
$50,000. This law effectively keeps out-of-state suppliers of funds from

making home mortgages in the State." In the Richmond Federal Reserve
District, new business was running below-normal "due in part to a
deliberate withholding of commitments pending the outcome of usury
legislation in Virginia and Maryland."
Still another restraining factor was the relatively attractive
yields available in other sectors of the capital market. The Federal
Reserve Bank of New York reported that "the current gap between home
mortgage interest rates / subject to usury laws_/ and bond yields has
introduced some interesting distortions into the home mortgage lending
market. For instance, among the savings banks interviewed, only the
institution based in Connecticut, a state without a usury law, expected
its new commitments on home mortgages to be about normal over the next
three months. Each of the other savings institutions surveyed expect
their new commitments to remain below normal over the same period."
Even so, new commitments on apartment houses were said to be
running somewhat higher in many areas than those on small homes, as was
the case last September. Some life insurance companies in several Federal
Reserve Districts reported, in fact, that they still refused to make
commitments on home mortgages altogether. The Minneapolis Federal Reserve
rank commented: 'That multi-family loan commitments have performed some-
what better than homes appears to be related to the fact that current
yields on non FHA-VA multi-family loans have been in the range of 7-1/4 to
8 per cent. Not only has this yield level proved competitive in relation
to yields in the public (and perhaps private placement) corporate sector

but also has had the effect of curtailing life insurance funds for
the local single-family conventional mortgage market, currently at about
a 6-3/4 per cent level."
Within the Atlanta Federal Reserve District, new commitments
on home loans were sharply depressed because of "the virtual absence of
a private market in FHA and VA leans" on which the region depends heavily.
In contrast, a "high level of commitment volume in multi-family mortgages
is being maintained substantially through joint ventures, willingness of
sponsors to pay high interest rates, and in some cases to make other
concessions to the lender. In all areas surveyed ...demand for
housing is being reflected in good apartment rental experience."
The New York Federal Reserve Bank, on the other hand, reported
that a strong reluctance seems to have emerged among lenders to commit
funds to permanent mortgages" for either home or apartment properties.
Although "yields on multi-family mortgages are relatively attractive, the
demand for multi-family mortgage financing has been dampened by a combina-
tion of high interest rates and the relatively high level of occupancy
now required by permanent lenders / before picking up the mortgage_/.
Moreover, since these more stringent occupancy requirements have the effect
of lengthening the period for which new construction loans to builders of
multi-family properties must be carried, most banks which have ordinarily
found this type of lending attractive now are reluctant to accept many
new construction loan commitments."

Outlook for savings and cash flows
Savings flows to banks and savings and loan associations
combined were expected to be slightly below normal over the next three
months. Although commercial banks generally looked forward to a stronger
net savings flow pattern through May than savings banks did, both types
of lenders anticipated above-normal inflows in most Federal Reserve
Districts. Least optimistic were the savings and loan associations,
with only 18 per cent of all respondents foreseeing above-normal savings
flows and 44 per cent expecting below-normal experience.

Commenting on the savings outlook, the Boston Federal Reserve
Bank underscored a comment made in several other Districts that "no undue
fear of disintermediation is apparent among various types of institu-
tions. ..." In the Boston District, however, "among commercial banks
and mutual savings banks, a new awareness of the importance of rate
competitiveness in maintaining inflows was quite apparent ...One
manifestation of this is the large number of mutual savings banks which
have recently begun paying daily interest. Many others are planning to
start."

Although "the fear of disintermediation seems to have subsided"
among savings banks interviewed in the Philadelphia Federal Reserve
District, "these bankers expect inflows to be fairly below normal levels.
Perhaps more important, almost all of the inflows are in the form of
certificates rather than regular passbook savings. Certificates are
regarded as too unstable for investment in residential mortgages."
A number of Federal Reserve Banks emphasized that end-of-year
savings inflows to banks had actually been more favorable than anticipated.
A commercial banker in the St. Louis Federal Reserve District nevertheless
"expressed concern over the possible effect of Regulation Q on savings
inflows if interest rates begin to rise. He felt the critical point would
be reached under present regulations if the Treasury placed a 6 per cent
coupon on a note issue."
Among the life insurance companies interviewed, the general
outlook was for slightly below-normal cash flows through May. In only
three Federal Reserve Districts were there no companies anticipating a
less-than-normal cash flow experience.

Outlook for new commitments
No marked change in new commitment activity appears likely over

lenders questioned. This outlook nevertheless implies a fairly marked

expansion in new commitment volume through the spring--a period when
new commitments increase quite sharply under normal conditions. Savings
and loan association lending prospects, which seem the brightest, suggest
that these institutions will continue to provide a critical share of
market support.

The outlook for new residential commitments is reportedly
constrained by many of the same factors also limiting normal current
activity--large outstanding commitments, deep mortgage discounts, low
usury ceilings, and attractive yields on other types of capital market
investments. In the New York Federal Reserve District, two commercial
banks indicated that they "do not find home mortgage yields any more
attractive than do the savings banks. Yet, they feel that pressures from
valued accounts--especially from corporate clients to pick-up the mortgages
of newly-arriving employees--will force them to grant home mortgage loans
they would rather not make."1relow

In the Philadelphia Federal Reserve District, it was noted
that "mortgage bankers are faced with a number of problems. One is lower
allocations from correspondents. Another is lack of real estate listings
for used housing because of reluctance by owners to sell. A third problem
is lack of builder interest to guarantee minimum prices any more. Too,
since FNMA essentially is the only bidder in the market / for FHA and VA
loans_/, mortgage bankers fear further cuts in FNMA's price."
Current borrower demand
Most lenders evaluated credit demands of home builders and
home buyers in February as being about in balance with available mortgage
funds--if not somewhat in excess of supply--at current rates and terms.
While the replies to this broad question were often difficult to evaluate,
demand-supply conditions apparently varied a good deal among areas, as
might be expected at this time of seasonal slack in real estate activity
for many localities. Within 4 of the 12 Federal Reserve Districts, for
example, mortgage demand was said to fall short of available funds.

Lessened borrower resistance to high mortgage rates was noted
in several Federal Reserve Districts. The St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank
added that "also inflationary expectations make the higher interest rates
seem less burdensome."
The Federal Reserve Bank of New York cautioned that "since the
usury laws / in its District_/ are holding rates at an artifically low
level, it is not certain that the many applicants still in the market
for mortgage money would be equally enthusiastic about obtaining a mortgage
at higher rates." In this connection, the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta
reported that "in virtually all cases the respondents volunteered the view
that much additional demand would quickly emerge at lower levels of
interest rates and relaxed-terms."
The Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco editorialized that
"the basis for an expected increase in housing starts in 1968_/ (again,
barring a credit squeeze comparable to that of 1966, which most observers
apparently discount) in large measure hinges upon a strengthening of
basic housing demand. This strengthening in part stems from a recent
reversal of the declining rate of in-migration into Southern California,
and in part from a continued substantial reduction in the inventory of
vacant and unsold housing in several major metropolitan areas. Further-
more, if the experience of the Seattle area is at all relevant (in Seattle,
housing activity has shown sustained and substantial gains since 1964 in
spite of a comparatively high level of interest rates and relatively less
generous terms of lending), housing demand in other areas of the District
(partly because of the sharp reduction in the housing surplus) may now be
somewhat less sensitive to a modest firming in interest rates and terms
from their present levels."

-13-
Related considerations
Considerable diversity among localities as well as among
Districts was reported in mortgage market conditions, as in earlier
surveys. The most optimistic summary was presented for the Boston Federal
Reserve District, where "a general sense of satisfaction attaches to
current market conditions." Even so, "conditions are tight, as evidenced
by continuing high downpayment requirements, and recent point increases
on FHA loans, but only midly so. As a result, lenders are generally
pleased with their returns. They further report that borrower resistance
to high rate structures is finally diminishing so that demand should hold
up very well over the next few months while at the same time rates will
be free to adjust to realistic levels to clear the market. The general
feeling of worry and uncertainty evidenced in the September / 1967_/
survey has diminished with greater confidence and even a cautious optimism
toward the future taking its place."
A sharply contrasting picture was drawn for the Federal Reserve
District of Philadelphia. There "the residential mortgage market picture
will not brighten in the months ahead. Uncertainties and structural
problems that have been around for some time continue to exist. Unsettled
conditions in the residential mortgage market cast a shadow over some of
the optimistic construction forecasts for 1968 now extant."
Although market uncertainities generally seemed less troublesome
in February than they did last fall, they were still to be reckoned with
in many areas. In this connection, the Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank

-14-
noted that "the common concern of most respondents was the uncertainty
attaching to the outlook for the FHA-VA sector, the proposed change to
