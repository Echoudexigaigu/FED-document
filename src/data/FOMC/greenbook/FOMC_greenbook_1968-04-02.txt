CURRENT ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL CONDITIONS

Board of Governors
of the Federal Reserve SystemMarch 27, 1968

I -1
SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK
Outlook for economic activity
Recent economic data confirm the acceleration of
inflationary pressures. Prices have been rising faster and final
sales, particularly for consumer outlays and defense expenditures,
are advancing rapidly. Over-all prices (GNP deflator) are now
expected to rise at an annual rate of 4 per cent this quarter, up
from the 3 per cent (ex Federal pay raise) in the fourth quarter.
Real GNP seems likely to grow by over 6 per cent, the largest rise
since the first quarter of 1966. Assuming tax increases, if any, do not
significantly affect activity in the second quarter, the gain in real
GNP should be only moderately smaller than in the current quarter.
Pressures on manpower resources, wages and prices are expected to
continue very strong.
The recent rise in consumer expenditures is likely to be
maintained. Preliminary retail sales data for the first half of
March (adjusted for the changing date of Easter) suggest that the
sharp upward trend in sales evident since the end of last year is
continuing. Incomes are likely to rise substantially further in the
second quarter because of higher employment and accelerating wage
increases. This should be reflected in a rise in consumer expendi-
tures almost as large as in this quarter, aided somewhat by a slight
further drift-off in the savings rate which, nevertheless, is expected
to remain at a relatively high level.

I-2
Defense spending is rising at a more rapid pace than estimated
in the January Budget. It now seems probable that such expenditures
will increase by at least $1.5 billion this quarter (about $1 billion
more than the Budget estimate) and the rise may be equally as large
next quarter. As yet, however, there has been no announcement of the
magnitude of an upward adjustment in defense costs. Any new spending
cuts are not expected to have much effect until after mid-year.
In contrast to the stepped-up momentum in consumption and
defense expenditures, changes in other sectors of the economy are
likely to be relatively moderate in the first half of the year. Business
fixed investment should level off in the second quarter according to
the latest Commerce-SEC survey. Housing starts, high in February,
should begin to slide somewhat in reflection of the further tightening
in mortgage markets. And inventory investment in the first quarter
is likely to be below the high fourth quarter rate, in part because
of more limited stockpiling of steel and autos than had been antici-
pated. A small rise in the rate of inventory accumulation may occur
in the second quarter in response to the recent heightened levels of
final sales and the approach of the deadline in steel negotiations.
Outlook for resource use and prices
Following the period of relative stability during the winter,
industrial production is expected to start moving up again in March
and April. Strike disruptions have ended in the auto industry; the

I -3
glass strike is settled; and production is in process of being
restored in the copper industry following an 8-month work stoppage.
Moreover, the momentum of the sharp step-up in consumer demands
since the beginning of the year is expected to provide an expansionary
impetus to output. With capacity continuing to grow, however,
production gains through the second quarter are likely to result
in only a small increase in the rate of manufacturing capacity
utilization from the fourth quarter average of 84.3 per cent.
The lag in industrial production growth in the first two
months of the year was accompanied by a slackening in productivity
gains, and, with hourly compensation moving up sharply further, unit
labor costs spurted again. Strong upward pressures on wages continue.
The glass and copper settlements incorporate package boosts of 7 per
cent or more--larger than the December GM settlement and setting a
new target for upcoming negotiations in aluminum, shipbuilding,
and apparel. Deferred wage increases in the 4 to 5 per cent range
will be received in the second quarter by 400,000 trucking workers
and by 1.5 million workers in a wide range of other industries, both
manufacturing and nonmanufacturing.
Further strong gains in employment, particularly in non-
manufacturing sectors, are expected to be large enough (assuming
no major disruption in connection with wage negotiations) to keep
the labor market tight and the unemployment rate close to the current
level of about 3.6 per cent.

I- 4
Since last autumn, wholesale prices of industrial commodities
have increased at an annual rate of about 4-1/2 per cent compared
with a rate of less than 3 per cent last summer, and less than 1
per cent from mid-1966 to mid-1967. Prices of foods and foodstuffs
have also moved up sharply; and price increases have accelerated
for services. The pace of advance in the consumer price index is
continuing at about 4 per cent, as compared with less than 3 per
cent from early 1967 to last autumn.
Demands for credit
Between now and mid-year the largest foreseeable source of
rising credit demand pressures is from the Federal Government. But
because of the stalemate on the fiscal program, the market remains
uncertain about the dimensions of Treasury cash needs, not only in
late spring but also in the second half of calendar 1968. Sizable
cash borrowing operations are not likely to be undertaken by the
Treasury until May in connection with the mid-month refunding, which
may be the first occasion for market participants to focus on the
precise size of forthcoming cash needs.
Demands for credit from State and local governments are
likely to remain fairly substantial, although not picking up beyond
their recent pace. Recent maneuverings with respect to the tax
status of industrial revenue bonds appear to have diminished the
potential for an upsurge in such issues.

I- 5
Business needs for external financing are likely to remain
on the moderate side, although an acceleration in financing demands
could develop if fears of further monetary restraint as direct credit
controls become widespread. Insofar as can be judged from the April
calendar, corporate demands in security markets are as yet below the
average of recent months, but there are indications that some further
offerings may be in the wing. Business loan demands at banks in the
last few months have been lower than bankers had expected, or hoped.
However, the odds do favor a pick-up in such demands during the spring,
given the large corporate income tax payments to be made and a
continued high rate of inventory accumulation. Borrowing at banks
may also rise if any appreciable further increase in short-term rates
induces commercial paper issuers to shift more of their financing to
commercial banks.
Supply of funds
With no substantial build-up in credit demand pressures
immediately in the offing, upward interest rate movements are likely
to depend on further constraints on the supply of funds or on
expectations that such constraints will develop. The March-April
reinvestment period (which unfortunately will be upon us before the
ink is dry on this text) is likely to see some movement of funds away
from nonbank savings institutions to the market, since market interest
rates have generally moved back to levels close to their late 1967
highs. The spring re-investment period experience is unlikely to
be as severe as in 1966, but should contribute to a further stiffening
in mortgage terms.

I- 6
Deposits inflows are also likely to diminish at banks
following the March quarterly interest crediting, and contribute
to continued reduced bank interest in acquisitions of State and
local and U.S. Government securities. At present market yields,
a noticeable slackening in inflows of consumer-type time and
savings deposits appears likely. A large increase in California
state income tax payments may accentuate pressures on savings insti-
tutions there in coming weeks.
Given recent Treasury bill rates, leading banks may be
able to roll-over maturing negotiable CD's if they are willing to
offer the maximum rate on 30-60 day maturities, as many seem to be
doing now. Even so, the sheer magnitude of April tax period maturities
suggests some further attrition in CD's over the next few weeks
for banks as a whole.
There are great uncertainties as to how liquid financial
institutions will feel after they come out of the spring interest-
crediting period and in light of business loan demands and CD run-
offs that develop around the mid-April tax period. Nevertheless,
it seems most likely that institutions in the second quarter will
have an even smaller net inflow of funds available for loans and
investments. Thus, barring a tax increase, market interest rates
could come under further upward pressure. Such pressures, however,
might not develop to any significant extent until later in the spring,

I -7
after seasonal downward pressures on short-term rates have dissipated
and when the Treasury begins to test the market's--and particularly
the banks'--ability or willingness to acquire new Federal debt. A
tendency for interest rates to rise sooner and cumulatively could
develop, however, if failure to take effective fiscal action, combined
with speculation against the dollar in exchange and gold markets,
led to expectations of a further market and overt tightening of
monetary policy.
Balance of payments
The payments deficit has remained very large during the first
quarter of 1968. On the basis of preliminary and incomplete figures,
the liquidity deficit before special transactions appears to have
been at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of about $5 billion during
the quarter. The comparable figure for the previous quarter was over
$6 billion. The deficit on the official reserve transactions basis
before special transactions may have been at a rate of about $4
billion in the first quarter.
The large size of the deficit has not been widely recognized
recently because seasonal influences are strongly favorable to the
United States at this time of year. But publication in mid-May of
deficit figures of this magnitude could well set off a new round of
private speculation in foreign exchange and gold markets, and also
of official gold purchases, unless U.S. economic policies have been
considerably altered in the meantime.

I -8
The main reason that the deficit has been larger in recent
quarters than before is that the trade surplus has been much smaller--
the smallest since 1959. Merchandise exports and imports both
remained in February at the very high levels reached in January.
Each was up about 10 per cent from its fourth quarter rate; but
compared with a year earlier, imports were up 17 per cent and exports
only 6 per cent. The trade surplus in January-February was only
slightly above the low fourth quarter annual rate of $1 billion, and
was down $3 billion from that of early 1967. In March, the trade
balance is expected to be adversely affected by a longshoremen's
strike that has been underway in New York since March 18.
Some non-trade elements in the balance of payments have shown
improvements in the first quarter. Net foreign purchases of U.S.
corporate stocks reached a record volume in January. Outstanding
bank claims on foreigners that are subject to FCRP guidelines were
reduced further by $90 million in February, after a $190 million
reduction in January; in both months, the reflow was more than
seasonal. The imposition of mandatory controls on direct investments
from January 1 may also have had a restraining effect on outflows
in the first quarter; a large volume of Euro-bond issues to finance
direct investments has been recorded. In March, a rights issue by
the Shell Oil Company attracted direct investment receipts of about
$200 million from its foreign parent company.

I-9
But these favorable developments--some of them clearly
temporary--appear to have been partly offset by adverse movements
in other transactions, possibly including shifts of funds to Canada
with the lifting of restrictions on such transfers, and some flight
of U.S.-owned capital to Europe during the weeks in March when the
foreign exchange markets were most disturbed and when the weekly
U.S. deficit figures were unusually large.

THE ECONOMIC PICTURE IN DETAIL
The Nonfinancial Scene
Gross national product. In the first quarter, economic
activity rose briskly and price increases accelerated at both whole-
sale and retail. Final sales rose considerably faster than antici-
pated, pushing up GNP at a rate we now estimate at $21 billion for
the quarter. Much of this increase reflects rising prices, with the
GNP deflator rising at an annual rate of 4 per cent. But the rate
of economic expansion in real terms apparently also increased substan-
tially--from an annual rate of 4.5 per cent in the fourth quarter to
6.5 per cent. In the absence of fiscal restraint we expect the
second quarter rise in real GNP to be only moderately smaller. Even
if a tax increase were to be enacted, the impact would probably not
be felt until after mid-year; consequently, consumer expenditures
are expected to maintain a sharply rising course in the second quarter.
Also, Federal expenditures will probably continue to rise, since any
new spending cuts initiated now would not be effective until fiscal
1969. On the other hand, the most recent survey of business
intentions indicates that after a substantial rise in the first
quarter, fixed capital outlays will level off.
The GNP deflator is now increasing at the rate of about 4
per cent annually, compared to 3.6 per cent in the final quarter of
last year. However, prices have risen more rapidly in the private
sector of the economy than this suggests, since the Federal pay
raise directly accounted for .6 percentage points of the increase
in the GNP deflator in the fourth quarter.

II -2
The sharply rising rate of consumer spending has been fueled
by substantial gains in personal income. Wages and salaries appear to
have increased at a rate of over 10 per cent annually in the first
quarter, reflecting rising employment, a higher minimum wage, and
widespread gains in wage rates and salaries. In addition, the
quarter included one month of increased social security benefits
which contributed materially to a rise of $2 billion in transfer
payments. The rise in spending by consumers about matched the upward
thrust of income and the rate of saving appears to have continued
above 7 per cent.
Consumer expenditures, including services, are thus likely
to have increased by $14 billion or at an annual rate of over 10 per
cent from the weak fourth quarter. The upsurge in sales was well-
distributed over all major categories of durable and nondurable
purchases. Unit sales of domestically produced cars have been main-
tained at a rate of about 8 million annually in the last 2-1/2
months, a marked improvement over the 7.5 million rate in the second
half of 1967, Furniture and appliance sales, which turned up in
the fourth quarter, are showing further strength, apparel sales have
jumped sharply after a disappointing Christmas season, and food sales
are surprisingly strong. (However, caution should be observed in
interpreting the changes in retail sales too literally, since the
preliminary data for two months now available are subject to revisions
which in the past have often been sizable).

Nonfarm inventory accumulation continues high: auto stocks
have been replenished, steel inventory accumulation has continued in
anticipation of a possible steel strike, and defense product
inventories are still rising. Nevertheless, on the basis of the
available January book value inventory statistics and in the context
of the high retail sales figures, our previous projection of the
dollar value of inventory accumulation for the first quarter appears
too high; and the estimated first quarter rate of accumulation has
been reduced to that of the fourth quarter of 1967. (In evaluating
current changes in book values, it should be noted that industrial
price increases have been more rapid than earlier. Consequently,
a smaller proportion of the rise in the book value of inventories
represents real accumulation.)
Business investment in new plant and equipment has also
added to demand in the first quarter. The recently completed
Commerce-SEC survey showed spending for fixed capital was higher in
the fourth quarter than had been previously indicated, and a further
rise of $2.1 billion, annual rate, was indicated for the first quarter.
In the second quarter, fixed investment is expected to level off.
A decline in capital outlays indicated in the Commerce-SEC survey
is likely to be offset by higher purchases of autos for business
use and by construction by institutions, which are not covered by the
survey

II -4
Expansion in real GNP is expected to decline from an
annual rate of 6.5 per cent in the first quarter to 4.9 per cent
in the second. The increase in personal income is also expected
to be smaller than in the quarter just ending, when wages and
salaries were recovering from the strike-affected fourth quarter
and the minimum wage was increased. Consumer expenditures however,
should continue to rise at a fast pace. Sales of domestic
new cars may rise to a rate of 8.5 million annually, but unless
consumers change their plans considerably from those indicated
in the Michigan Survey released this month, they are unlikely to
exceed this figure. Nondurable goods sales are likely to increase
at a rate approaching that of the first auarter, and outlays for
services may rise even faster. The rate of saving may dip slightly,
but should remain high.
The rate of inventory accumulation may be larger in the
second quarter than in the first. Growth in auto stocks should
slacken, but the accumulation of steel inventories will continue
and other industries may show larger increases in the rate of
inventory investment in response to rapid growth in final sales.
Residential construction activity is expected to show
little change in the second quarter, after a slight rise in the
quarter just ending. Despite a jump in February, starts in the
quarter now ending will probably average 1.49 million--moderately
above the fourth quarter rate which, in turn, was higher than in the

II -5
third quarter. In the second quarter, starts are projected to
drop about 100,000 units, as a result of tightening in mortgage
fund availability. This reverses the upward trend in starts
which began in late 1966, but the effects on the dollar volume
of residential construction will be slight until the second half
of this year.
Federal expenditures for goods and services are continuing
to rise substantially both for defense and other purposes. Pre-
liminary evidence for the first quarter suggests that the increase
for defense over the fourth quarter will be about $500 million
higher than shown in the last Greenbook, or about $1.5 billion. A
similar increase is shown for the second quarter. These increases
are much larger than in the fourth quarter, aside from the Federal
pay-raise. The present estimates of defense exceed those implied
in the Budget by $700 million, at an annual rate, in the first
quarter and $1.8 billion in the second. Crops are also being put
under loan at a faster rate than anticipated, boosting Federal non-
defense outlays. For the fiscal year as a whole our estimates
of goods and service expenditures are about $1 billion above the
Budget.
The rise in Federal expenditures is being accompanied by
a fast growth in receipts, owing both to the accelerated gains in
personal income and the surge in corporate profits. In the fourth
quarter profits before tax rose to $85.4 billion, annual rate,
which was even above Federal Reserve estimates and much higher than
generally anticipated. In the second quarter, profits are likely
to be at a rate of $93.0 billion.

II -6
As a result, of the increase in both expenditures and in
receipts, the NIA deficit is projected to expand by only $2 billion,
annual rate, between the fourth quarter of 1967 and the second
quarter of 1968.

Industrial production. Industiral production in March
is tentatively estimated to have increased about one-half point
from the preliminary February level of 161.3. The sketchy available
data for March do not indicate any weakness, but also do not
indicate any marked upward movement. Production of raw steel (through
March 23) has increased only fractionally, but was at an annual
rate of 149 million tons as compared with 127 million tons for
the year 1967. With rolling mill operations near capacity, the
expected steel inventory accumulation by consuming industries may be
accomplished in part by pulling down near-record steel mill stocks
rather than by much further expansion of production.
Auto assemblies have recovered from the strike reduced
February level and, at an anuual rate of 9.0 million units, are up
about 10 per cent (.3 of one point in the total index). Production
of trucks also rose in March and is well above a year ago. Output
of television sets and home radios in early March remained at the
February level but was below previous highs of last year. Other
available weekly production data indicate that in early March output
of crude petroleum and refined petroleum products rose, while
paperboard production declined.
While the tentatively estimated level of the production
index in the first quarter of 1968 is below the December record
high, it is 1.2 per cent above the fourth quarter of 1967, or an
annual rate of increase of 4.8 per cent. With business stccks generally

II -10
ample, further gains in industrial production in the months ahead
probably will come mainly from increased demands by final users
rather than from large further increases in inventory accumulation.

Capacity utilization. Utilization of capacity by manufacturers
was estimated to be 84.0 per cent in February, down from 84.5 per cent
the previous month. The decline was due to the continuing increase in
estimated capacity. At the February level the operating rate was
about the same as in midsummer.
Operating rates continue to be high in the aircraft, electric
power generating equipment and petroleum refining industries and only
moderate amounts of unused capacity are available for production of
most textile and rubber steel products. Production of some steel pro-
ducts has reached near-capacity levels.

Retail sales. Retail sales in February rose 1.5 per cent
further to a level sharply above the depressed level a year earlier.
The February increase followed a 2 per cent rise in January. Figures
for the 2 weeks ending March 16 suggest a further rise for the month,
after allowance for the date of Easter. It should be noted, however,
that higher sales recently reflect more rapid price increases than
earlier.
Increases in sales in the past two months were widespread.
The advance from the fourth quarter was largest at durable stores, at
which automobiles, lumber, furniture, and appliances were all up sub-
stantially. Sales at nondurable stores also rose considerably, with
increases for apparel and food especially large.

Sales have not reached the post-strike levels anticipated,
and industry estimates for the 1968 model year have been scaled
down from about 8.5 million units to around 8.2 (excluding an
estimated 800,000 imports). Since sales so far in the model year
have averaged 7.8 million units, an average annual rate of 8.6 million
will have to be maintained from now on to reach industry predictions.
New car stocks, seasonally adjusted, have increased only
slightly since the end of January. On March 10 they totaled about
1.5 million units, or slightly below the high level a year earlier.
Relative to sales, the current 52-days supply is also lower than a
year earlier but about average for other recent years. Both stocks
and sales of used cars in February were 3 per cent above a year ago.
Consumer credit. Expansion in instalment credit has shown
renewed strength in recent months, as compared with the slow pace
of most of last year. Net increases in instalment credit outstanding
have been running close to $5 billion, annual rate, nearly $2
billion larger than the increase for all of 1967.
The pick-up reflects both a somewhat faster pace of borrowing
and a tapering off of the exceptionally rapid rate of debt repayments
in 1967. Repayments in the first quarter, from the evidence now
available, are not likely to be much larger than in the fourth. The
leveling-off tendency has been most noticeable in other consumer goods
and personal loans, the same categories experiencing the sharp rise
in repayments in the second and third quarters of last year.

II -14
Much of the recent pick-up in use of credit has been in the
auto area and has been associated with the improvement in auto sales.
Extensions of credit for nonauto consumer goods loans have also
continued to grow, and personal loans have held up well. Instalment
credit extended for home repair and modernization continues weak,
but the overall impact on the total has been negligible since this
type of credit is small in amount.
The average size of new-car contracts has shown little
further change in early 1968, following the sharp run up last fall
when the new higher-priced models were introduced. Indeed, contracts
written by some lenders have called for smaller amounts than a month
or two ago. This has been particularly true for bank purchased
paper and credit union loans. However, for direct auto loans made
by the banks and paper purchased by sales finance companies, the
average note has continued to creep up.
For all lender groups, the average new car note is now
running a little over $100 above a year earlier, Last fall the
differential was closer to $150. The narrowing of this differential
probably reflects mainly an increase in dealer discounts as inventories
of the new models reach more normal proportions. There is, of course,
the possibility that customers are being asked for larger downpayments,
but we have no evidence that this is so.

II -15
Orders and shipments: durable goods. New orders received
by manufacturers of durable goods edged up 1.6 per cent in February
according to Census advance figures. Iron and steel orders were
up 15 per cent, however, accounting for almost all the rise in the
total. Changes in other industries were mixed, with increases in
orders for aircract and electrical machinery offset by declines for
autos and non-electrical machinery.
Partly as a result of past or anticipated future strikes,
the recent movements of the new orders series have been difficult
to interpret. While the trend remains upward, it does not appear
quite so strong now as it did toward the end of last year when orders
rose very sharply. The February volume of new orders was about 5
per cent above last summer's average, but if iron and steel are
excluded the increase over this period was only 2 per cent. Ship-
ments are now at about the same level as orders and order backlogs
are no longer rising rapidly. Although unfilled orders did increase
0.6 per cent in February, they remained slightly below their December
levels despite a rapid buildup in order backlogs for steel.
New orders for machinery and equipment were down sharply
in February after rising in each of the three previous months. Despite
large fluctuations, machinery orders have shown no consistent trend
since last summer. Unfilled orders for machinery have recently
been declining.

II -16
Shipments of durable goods declined 2.8 per cent in February.
Declines were widespread with only iron and steel producers recording
an increase. The February decline was the second in succession and
the upward trend which began last summer does not look as strong
now as it did earlier. Nevertheless, February shipments were still
about 6 per cent above the level of last July.

Construction and real estate. Total new construction
activity, which had risen 3 per cent to a new high in January, changed
little in February, according to the preliminary projection of the
Census Bureau. Residential construction, which may be understated,]

II -17
continued not far from the record high reached in November of 1963.
While private nonresidential activity also changed little, this
followed a substantial and widespread recovery in January back
almost to the peak of January 1967. Public construction edged
higher, but was below the record rate a year earlier,

1/ Seasonally adjusted annual rates; preliminary. Data for the most
recent month (February) are available under a confidential arrangement
with the Census Bureau. Under no circumstances should public reference
be made to them.
Housing starts expanded further in February, nearly to the
advanced rate reached last November. The increase, which was somewhat
above staff expectations, reflected in part the more than usual
number of operating days this February because of leap year. (Census
makes no direct allowance for this type of variation in the case of
starts.) But improved builder confidence about mortgage market
prospects--aroused at the time by the less than anticipated disinterme-
diation experienced by lenders in the December-January reinvestment
period--may also have been a factor.

II -18
A feature of the February increase in starts was its
concentration in single-family structures. These exceeded the
million-unit mark for the first month since December of 1965.
While the South accounted for most of the expansion, only the
Northeast states--which had led the upturn in January--showed a
drop.
Building permits (which are adjusted for working days) also
rose in February and exceeded the advanced rate reached last December.
Moreover, all regions and all types of structures shared in the rise.
Even so, some decline in the seasonally adjusted rate of starts
seems likely for March because the normal seasonal allowance from
February to March calls for a rise of more than 50 per cent in the
unadjusted level and March this year has two fewer working days
(9 per cent) than in other recent years. Altogether, however, starts
in the first quarter may approach a 1.50 million annual rate and
average moderately more than in the advanced fourth quarter of 1967.

Seasonally adjusted sales of single family houses by
speculative builders continued little changed in January at a level
a fifth above a year earlier. Builders' stocks of such houses
(including those under construction) also changed little. The
extremely low level of available stocks, which has persisted without
essential change since early 1967, has been a limiting factor on
sales, particularly at a time when resistance by buyers to either
higher prices or higher interest rates has apparently lessened
further as prospects for any decline in such costs over the near
term have dwindled.
Vacancy rates forhome-owner units now available for the
fourth quarter of last year remained about the same--1.2 per cent--
as in most other recent periods. But vacancy rates for the sensitive
rental series dropped from a reduced third quarter average of 6.4 per
cent to 5,6 per cent of all units available and fit for use. The
fourth quarter decline brought the rate to the lowest in a decade
and was sharpest in the South.

Business plans for plant and equipment expenditures. Business
spending on new plant and equipment in 1968 will total $65.25 billion,
$3.6 billion or 5.8 per cent more than last year, according to the
Commerce-SEC February survey of business plans. This gain is a little
larger than the 4.9 per cent indicated by the McGraw-Hill survey of
business plans taken last October. The 5.8 per cent increase now
anticipated compares with an actual rise in 1967 of only 1.7 per
cent--the smallest since 1961 when there was a decline--and with increases
of about 15 to 17 per cent in the three years 1964 through 1966.
Business fixed capital outlays in the final quarter of 1967
exceeded earlier plans for the first time since the spring quarter
of 1966. Spending increased 3.0 per cent in the fourth quarter
rather than the 1.9 per cent indicated by business plans mid-way
through the quarter. As plant and equipment expenditures fell short
of earlier anticipations in each successive quarter last year, plans
for 1967 outlays were scaled down--from a 3.9 per cent increase
as indicated in the February survey to a 1.4 per cent as shown in
the November one. The actual gain for the year, as noted above,
was 1.7 per cent.
The increase in 1967 outlays was less than the 2.6 per
cent estimated rise in prices of nonresidential fixed investment;
consequently, the physical volume represented by these outlays was
smaller than in 1966. Moreover, the 1968 physical volume equivalent
may be no larger than, or perhaps even smaller than that in 1967
since prices of machinery and equipment have recently risen at a
faster rate than the anticipated increase in outlays.

II -21
According to February plans, outlays will rise substantially
in the current quarter, edge off in the second quarter, and then
increase moderately in the last half of the year to a rate 6.9 per
cent above that of a year earlier.
Plant and equipment expenditures now planned by manufacturers
for 1968 are 4.6 per cent above 1967. Manufacturers' spending accounts
for the bulk of the first quarter rise in the total; but their spending
will increase only a trifel further in the second quarter and then
edge down in the last half of the year.
Nonmanufacturing industries plan to increase their outlays
by 6.7 per cent in 1968. Relatively large increases are indicated
by nonrail transportation, public utilities, communication, and mining
industries; the commercial and other industry grouping indicates
only a small increase from last year and railroads plan a further
substantial decline.
In the first half of this year total nonmanufacturing spending
will decline a little from the final quarter of 1967, despite a large
increase by public utilities. In the second half of the year, however,
nonmanufacturing outlays will rise because of increases in nonrail
transportation and the communication, commercial, and other industry
grouping. Public utilities now report a 10 per cent increase in
1968, but most of this gain reflects a very large rise in the first
quarter as declines are now indicated for the second quarter and for
the second half of the year.

Labor market. Employment rose sharply in February,
rebounding from the weather-induced slowdown the previous month.
Along with a substantial recovery in the workweek and further gains
in wages, this produced in February the largest increase in personal
income in over two years. The labor force also expanded strongly
(after declining the previous month) and the unemployment rate returned
to the December level of 3.7 per cent from 3.5 per cent in January.
Nonfarm payroll employment increased by 550,000; nearly
half, or 250,000, of the rise was in the volatile construction industry
and probably reflected improved weather conditions. But even apart
from the employment gain in construction and the net effect of strikes,
the increase in nonfarm employment was still very large (330,000) and
widely based. Since August (prior to the auto strike), nonfarm employ-
ment has increased at an annual rate of 3.0 million.
Manufacturing employment rose by 66,000 in February to a
level somewhat above the January 1967 high. If it had not been for
the 36,000 net increase in workers on strike (mainly glass workers),
the rise in factory employment would have been in the neighborhood of
100,000, the strongest since the summer of 1966. Particularly large
gains occurred in the transportation equipment and electrical machinery
industries as well as in textile products and apparel. Fairly large
employment gains also were reported in the construction-related lumber
and funiture industries, and in the auto-related rubber and fabricated
metal industries.

II -24
As compared with a year ago, however, employment gains in
manufacturing were small--about 100,000--and concentrated in the non-
durable goods sector. Increases in ordnance (where employment has
expanded since mid-1965 in response to defense needs) and in trans-
portation equipment were offset by a dip in primary metals, partly
reflecting the prolonged copper strike, and in the machinery and
electrical equipment industries.
The average workweek of manufacturing production workers
in February regained the previous month's loss, returning to the
December level of 40.7 hours. Gains in hours of work over the month
were widespread. Significant increases since December have occurred
in transportation equipment, stone-clay-glass and leather. The work-
week was nearly half an hour longer in February than a year earlier,
when hours of work had declined to the lowest point reached in 1967,
but it remained almost an hour below the 1966 peak levels.
In nonmanufacturing activities, employment gains have been
widespread. Employment in transportation and public utilities has been
advancing in recent months. In the nonindustrial sector, the February
gain in trade employment was particularly large--almost 100,000--and
could help to explain the very large rise in part-time employment of
teenagers which occurred that month. The finance and service sectors
continued to advance strongly as did State and local government.
Federal government employment rose slightly and has increased 26,000
since November, reversing the downtrend of the preceding 4 months. In
February, total nonfarm employment was 2.0 million larger than a year
earlier with the trade-service-State and local government complex
accounting for 90 per cent of the increase.

II -25
The January dip in unemployment had occurred among teenagers
and women; in February the teenage unemployment rate rose somewhat but
was unchanged from December and from a year earlier. The over-all
strength of the labor market during the past few months is indicated
by the continued low rate of unemployment for men 25 years and over.
Their unemployment rate was 1.9 per cent in February for the third
month in a row, about equal to the low rate reached in the Korean War
period.
Earnings in manufacturing. Hourly earnings of production
workers in manufacturing averaged $2.95 in February, 5.7 per cent
higher than a year earlier. This was much larger than the average
year-over-year rise during 1967, and reflected the large first-year
wage increases negotiated in the high-wage durable goods industries
since last fall. The settlements in copper and glass in the past few
weeks provided packages that were even higher than the recent run of
settlements, 7 per cent or more a year. Acceleration in wage increases
in the nondurable goods sector has been less pronounced, although hourly
earnings in low-wage nondurable goods industries increased faster in
February than for nondurable goods as a whole, as a result of the
increase in the Federal minimum wage effective February 1.
Average weekly earnings in February were 6.8 per cent higher
than a year earlier. The sharp over-the-year rise in February reflected
both increasing wage rates and the 0.4 hour rise in the average workweek
from the low level of a year earlier. After more than a year of little

II -26
or no increase, the purchasing power of workers' weekly earnings should
now begin to show substantial gains over the year, providing continued
expansive impetus to personal consumption expenditures.
Unit labor costs. Unit labor costs in manufacturing rose
sharply further in February as compensation per manhour surged up and
productivity dipped. Unit labor costs were 4.7 per cent above a year
earlier, the largest increase since last October, although still below
the 5.5 per cent increases of the first three quarters of 1967.

While earnings have continued to rise sharply, output per
manhour dropped below the December-January levels because of the slug-
gish performance of manufacturing output. Output per manhour showed a
larger increase in February from the year-earlier level than it did in
most months last year--when average increaseswere one per cent or less.
But this still slow pace fell far short of the rapid rate of growth in
wages, so that the increase in average hourly earnings has been
reflected in sharply rising unit labor costs.
Increasing wage rates will continue to exert substantial
pressure on labor costs in the immediate future; any significant easing
of the pressure is dependent upon a rebound in productivity, which
usually accompanies a pickup in manufacturing output.

II -27
Wholesale prices. The BLS industrial commodity index in-
creased 0.5 per cent in February and, according to their preliminary
estimate, 0.3 per cent further in March to 108.6 per cent of the
1957-59 average. Prices of foods and foodstuffs also rose substan-
tially further in February and March, with gains recorded for live-
stock, meats, eggs, fresh fruits, and fats and oils. At 107.0 the BLS March
estimate for farm products and processed foods and feeds was up 3-1/2
per cent from last November's low. With both industrial and agricultural
commodities up, the total wholesale price index reached a new high in
March estimated at 108.3 per cent of the 1957-59 average.
The rise in industrial commodity prices, which began last
summer, accelerated in the autumn and winter months. The February
increase was the largest since the upturn began and also the largest
since November 1956. While the March estimate indicates a slowing of
the advance, the preliminary estimates have been revised upward con-
sistently in other recent months.
The acceleration of the rise beginning last autumn has been
reflected in an upward movement in the number of industrial commodities
showing month-to-month increases--particularly between September and
October and again in January and February, as shown in the table below.

In terms of a product breakdown--and in terms of the special
FR groupings of industrial commodities as materials and products--the
February step-up in the pace of advance reflected in large part
unusually sharp further increases for raw and semi-fabricated copper
and lumber and plywood and a turn-around in prices of petroleum
products which had been declining since last August following the
brief run-up during the Mid-East crisis. The FR grouping of in-
dustrial materials showed an especially large rise in February.
Reflecting mainly sharp increases for copper, lumber, and
cotton, average prices of sensitive industrial materials increased
6-1/2 per cent from last July through February, almost back to the
high reached in the spring of 1966. Over the 7-month period ending
in February, sensitive materials (with a weight of 12-1/2 per cent)
accounted for over a third of the rise in the industrial commodity
total. Prices of cotton goods have already eased off somewhat since
the turn of the year. With the copper strike now in process of being

II -29
settled, the sharp price run-up--which has reflected mainly the shift
to high-priced imported copper with domestic supplies cut off--may
soon be over. Lumber prices have been under upward pressure from
short supplies and strong demands, and by February, were at a new
high for the post-World War II period.

Prices of other (sluggish) materials also showed a sizable
rise in February. Reflecting earlier gains in copper prices, prices of
plumbing fixtures and brass fittings increased substantially. Price
increases were larger than in other recent months for millwork, metal
containers, refractories, and glass containers; and prices of motor
vehicle parts were boosted again. Also contributing in February was
the turn-up in prices of petroleum products.

II -30
Prices of consumer nonfoods rose 0.3 per cent in February--
more than in any of the preceding three months but less than last
August and last October when the large rubber tire and auto price in-
creases became effective. Price increases for appliances showed some
acceleration in February, and apparel and textile house furnishings
continued to rise at a sizable pace.
The rise in producers' equipment prices slowed rather
abruptly in February--the increase for the month was 0.2 per cent as
compared with an average of over 0.5 per cent a month between September
and January. For the entire period since last July these prices have
increased at the high annual rate of 4.6 per cent.
Consumer prices. The consumer price index increased another
0.3 per cent in February, to 119.0 per cent of the 1957-59 average.
Consumer services--particularly medical care, mortgage interest,
home maintenance, housekeeping services, and auto repairs--led the
advance. Food prices showed a somewhat smaller increase (0.3 per cent;
or 0.2 per cent seasonally adjusted) than in other recent months. With
apparel and furniture prices continuing to climb, the average for all
non-food commodities increased 0.3 per cent, about in line with recent
trends.
The CPI has increased 0.3 per cent (on a rounded basis) for
five consecutive months. However, for 4 of the 5 months the unrounded
increase was 0.34 per cent, and from September to February the index rose
at an annual rate of 3.9 per cent--with the January-February rate
slightly higher.

II -31
Farm production plans. Farmers surveyed on March 1 about
their spring planting plans reported cuts of only 2 per cent (3.5
per cent with winter wheat included) from last year's acreage which
had been boosted 6.3 per cent to meet the world food crisis. With
good weather, this acreage could easily produce a crop close to the
1967 record and somewhat in excess of expected use.
In an effort to get 1968 acreages back in line with what
they had been prior to the 1967 expansion, the USDA offered a feed
grain diversion program essentially the same as the attractive 1966
program; cut back acreage allotments a very moderate 13 per cent,
considering that they had been raised 32 per cent for the 1967 crop;
and, lowered the mandatory cotton program minimum diversion from 12.5
per cent of allotments to 5.0 per cent in an effort to get land back
into cotton. These program changes have apparently encouraged shifts
in the right direction. Rice allotments for 1968 were raised 20
per cent because of expected heavy export requirements.
With normal weather, the Crop Reporting Board estimates
that the prospective corn acreage could produce a 4.4 billion bushel
crop compared with last year's 4.7 billion bushel record and a wheat
crop equaling the 1.5 billion bushels of last year--both in excess of
prospective use for the second year. Unless growing conditions are
unusually favorable, the planned 11.1 million acres of cotton is
unlikely to produce the record yield which would be required to meet
the 13.0 to 13.5 million bales needed in the 1968-69 marketing year.

II -32
Prospective soybean acreage could produce the nation's first billion
bushel crop and rice may exceed last year's record output by 22 per
cent.
Hog production prospects. The March 21 pig crop report
indicates that producers are sticking to their December plans to hold
the pig crop to year-earlier levels in December-February and then to
cut it 2 or 3 per cent below in March-May. Corn Belt producers
accounting for three-fourths of production on March 1 confirmed the
December projection and indicated plans to keep the June-August crop
3 per cent below a year earlier. The report suggest producer dis-
satisfaction with hog price prospects which is hard to explain in
terms of farm-oriented factors because feed supplies are large and
hog-corn price ratios have ranged from 16.9 to 18.8 during the past
10 months, ordinarily considered favorable ratios.
Producer plans will still permit a relatively high level of
pork consumption in 1968 because hog numbers have been increasing
cyclically over the past two years. Per capita consumption in 1967
amounted to 64 pounds, 9 per cent above the short supplies of the two
preceding years, and a little above the 1957-59 average. The pro-
jected pig crop cuts will affect slaughter in the seasonally
high fall and winter months and may moderate the usual seasonal price
declines then.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL SITUATION
Bank credit. Commercial bank credit in March, as measured
by the bank credit proxy on a daily average basis, is expected to
increase at a considerably slower pace than the 9.2 per cent average
annual rate of January and February. Data thus far in March indicate
that growth in the bank credit proxy may be only about 4-1/2 per cent
for the month as a whole.
After expanding in the latter part of February in connection
with bank underwriting of the Treasury financing, total loans and
investments at large banks displayed relatively little growth through
the first two weeks of March, as indicated by the chart on the follow-
ing page showing seasonally adjusted weekly reporting bank data. The
reduced rate of expansion in early March reflects both a reduction of
Government security holdings by banks and relatively weak loan demand,
particularly for business and security loans.
Bank liquidation of Government securities following the
February Treasury financing contributed substantially to the slower
rate of bank credit expansion in early March. Bank sales of such
securities probably reflect the strong investor demand for short-term
securities, as well as the desire by dealer banks to lighten their
portfolios in view of the uncertainties about the course of monetary
policy. In addition, given the rising cost of issuing CD's, banks
probably found the sale of bills a less expensive means to acquire
funds.

Acquisitions of other securities by banks remained moderate,
although banks in New York added substantially to their holdings of
municipals, probably reflecting the relatively weak loan demand at
these banks and possibly some switching out of Treasury issues into
these higher yielding securities.
The reduction in total loans outstanding in early March was
associated in large part with the decline in security loans. Govern-
ment security dealers lightened their inventories, including some
longer-term maturities.
Business loans, after showing some moderate growth in late
February, remained almost unchanged on balance during early March. As
has been the case since the first of the year, however, banks in New
York City have generally experienced weaker business loan demand than
banks outside New York. Although the February lending practices survey
indicated that most large banks were expecting business loan demand to
pick up, no significant increase is yet visible. Corporations still
seem to have adequate cash flows, and commercial paper continued to
offer an attractive alternative to bank financing through early March,
but during the current week the rate advantage has largely disappeared,
particularly for dealer placed loans.
Corporate borrowings from banks for March tax payments were
small in comparison to previous years. Estimated tax payments for that
month are about 40 per cent below the average of those in the same
period for the preceding three years. However, even taking into account
the reduced level of tax payments, data for New York City banks suggest

that demands for bank financing over the March tax and dividend period
were mild. As a per cent of total tax payments, bank financing was
significantly lower this year than in previous years, as shown in the

is reflected in a rise in the ratio of term to total loans from 43.7
per cent at the end of December to 45.5 per cent at the end of February
for weekly reporting banks. This ratio always jumps in late December
and in January, reflecting primarily "carve-out" loans of extractive
industries. However, the increase this year was more than seasonal in
January and contraseasonal in February. This increase was associated,
in most part, not only with the unusually large volume of carve-out
loans this year but also with expanded term loan borrowing by the
primary metals industry, which includes iron and steel producers.
Several major steel companies are reported to be borrowing under longer-
term revolving credits arranged in recent months, mainly to finance
plant and equipment outlays, but some of these funds presumably are
also being used to finance inventory expansion of borrowers and their
customers.
Bank deposits. Through the third week in March, total time
and savings deposits have generally maintained the more rapid rate of
expansion begun after mid-February. However, this recent growth was
the result of a more than seasonal increase in time and savings deposits
other than CD's, since outstanding CD's declined substantially in early
March and are not expected to recover much by month-end. But, with the
exceptional strength in other time deposit flows, for the month as a
whole, the increase in total time and savings deposits, on a daily
average basis, is currently projected at an annual rate of 11.0 per
cent as compared with an 8.4 per cent rate in February.

III -6
As has been the case since the end of the year, the recent
decline in outstanding CD's took place primarily at banks in New York
City. Weaker business loan demand at these banks relative to banks
outside New York probably made New York banks less interested in issu-
ing new CD's. In addition, rising short-term market rates had forced
CD offering rates to the Regulation Q ceiling on all maturities by
mid-March. Earlier in the year, banks had been able to attract funds
maturing in 6 months and often longer at the ceiling rate.
Growth in consumer-type time deposits is estimated to have
accelerated somewhat in March from the approximate 10 per cent annual
rate of increase in February. Regular savings deposits continued to
expand in spite of rising short-term market rates and higher yielding
alternative instruments at banks and other savings institutions. The
bulk of this increase appears to have taken place at country banks,
where depositors are probably somewhat less interest-sensitive than at
large city banks.
After a temporary surge early in March, bank liabilities to
foreign branches for the week ending March 20 fell $100 million below
the level outstanding at the end of February, reflecting in most part
the sharp 145 basis point jump in Euro-dollar rates during that gold
crisis week.
The money stock in late February and early March continued
to fluctuate around a moderate upward trend. Most of these fluctua-
tions, particularly the decline in the money stock around the time of
the Treasury financing in late February and the subsequent increase in

III -7
early March, reflect the movement of funds in and out of Government
deposits. However, the decline in the money stock after the first
week in March--at the same time that Government deposits were falling--
may indicated that some private demand balances were used to meet tax
and dividend payments, particularly in view of the relatively light
bank borrowing for these payments. On a daily average basis, however,
the money stock is projected to increase at a 4.5 per cent annual rate
for the month as a whole, with increases in currency holdings of the
public accounting for over half the projected expansion.
Nonbank depositary intermediaries. Suggesting a continuation
of the improved February performance at all mututal savings banks,
inflows for the fifteen largest mutuals in New York City during the
first half of March were about equal to the previous record inflows a
year earlier. Inflows to savings and loan associations in February
remained below their 1967 pace, but after rough allowance for seasonal
factors, they were above the reduced inflows experienced from late fall
through January.

The general improvement in depositary inflows in February-
and possibly in March--may be associated with a smaller volume of total
security issues and declining short-term market yields, as well as with
a continued high rate of personal saving. However, the sharp increase
in market yields in mid-March, despite some abatement late in the month,
seem likely to be associated with more than seasonal outflows during
the March-April reinvestment period.1/
The increase in passbook loans at the New York savings banks
in both February and early March has approximated the pace in 1966 and--
as then--this development will probably lead to increased withdrawals
during the end of March grace period. Moreover, savings and loan asso-
ciations appear to be adjusting their balance sheets in anticipation of
an unfavorable reinvestment period experience. S&L liquidity ratios
returned to recent highs and in February their mortgage commitments rose
no more than seasonally.
Mortgage market developments. During the first half of
March, the availability of mortgage credit apparently changed little
following a slight easing in February. With rising yields on competi-
tive market instruments since mid-March, however, there has probably
been a resumption of the tightening which had been in progress in the
mortgage market during the second half of last year.
1/ The effect of rising market yields on inflows to nonbank depositary
institutions is discussed more fully in Appendix A.

III -9
During February--when savings inflows improved and mortgage
portfolio repayments remained high--contract interest rates on con-
ventional home mortgages remained unchanged at the postwar peak reached
in January, according to the FHA series. In the more sensitive secondary
market, yields on certain FHA home mortgages, which had reattained their
1966 high in December-January, edged down for the first time in 10
months. Since returns on new issues of high-grade corporate bonds rose,
the already depressed gross yield spread of home mortgages over such
bonds narrowed somewhat, as the table shows. The yield spread continued
to offer little net incentive for mortgage investment by institutional
investors after allowance for customary mortgage servicing fees.

New mortgage loans (chiefly on residential properties) were
disbursed by savings and loan associations and New York State savings
banks in February at a seasonally adjusted rate which changed little,
and remained somewhat below the advanced pace reached last fall.
Outstanding mortgage commitments were taken down by these thrift
institutions at approximately the same over-all rate as new commitments
were approved. As a result, the seasonally adjusted backlog of resi-
dential mortgage commitments on their books, which had risen through
November of last year, continued essentially unchanged. The lack of
further recent growth in S&L mortgage commitments has partly reflected
the already advanced level of such commitments in relation to recent
cash inflows from new savings and mortgage repayments; for the more
diversified New York State savings banks, it has apparently evidenced
the continued preference for corporate bonds in view of the still com-
paratively unfavorable mortgage yield spreads.
Corporate and municipal bond markets. Yields on new
corporate and municipal bonds have advanced significantly since the
end of February, with the rise in yields in both markets quickened by
the gold crisis and related monetary developments. Over the four weeks
since the end of February, corporate new issue yields rose about 25
basis points to a level only slightly below the peak yields of December
1967. While municipal yields have dropped back from the level registered
at midmonth, these yields on balance have advanced about 10 to 12 basis
points since the end of February to levels exceeding their 1967 highs.

Municipal yields were influenced not only by a sharply

of offerings and a surge of industrial revenue bond issues. In the
corporate market, while domestic new issues continued relatively light,
the market was put under pressure by announcements of a large Canadian
corporate offering and by issues of PC's and World Bank Bonds--instru-

Available evidence continues to point to moderation in the
volume of publicly-offered corporate bonds, even though the estimate
of the March volume has been raised--mainly because of the addition
to the calendar of a large Canadian issue. Total bond and stock
offerings in March will likely aggregate about $2.1 billion, which is
about a normal seasonal rise from the $1.7 billion volume during
February.

In April, total corporate security offerings are expected
to decline to less than $1.7 billion, a larger than seasonal drop-off
from March. Public offerings of corporate bonds in April are now esti-
mated at $750 million, below the first quarter monthly average rate.
However, in light of the late March announcement of two large industrial

III -13
bond issues, as well as several smaller offerings, this estimate may
be subject to considerable revision. The recently announced issues
all have indefinite offering dates and could come to market anytime
this spring. Moreover, one of the large proposed issues is highly
tentative.
In contrast to corporate markets, State and local government
bond volume remains large with offerings in April estimated at $1.15
billion, the same as in March. Included in the March volume are indus-
trial revenue bonds of more than $200 million which were rushed to
market in the first half of the month in anticipation of the loss of
tax-exemption privileges. As a partial offset, there was about $100
million of other issues which were postponed because of high interest
costs.

It is possible that more municipal borrowers will defer a
significant portion of issues scheduled for April. And if this occurs,
it is not expected that industrial revenue issues will fill the gap.
The number of such issues brought to market in order to meet the
Treasury's initial deadline of March 15--after which interest on these
bonds would supposedly not be tax-exempt--apparently exhausted all
financing reasonably far along in the planning stage. Appendix B pro-
vides information on the Treasury's most recent proposals regarding
industrial aid financing.
Stock market developments. After declining sharply from
the all-time highs reached in mid-January, stock prices fluctuated
within a narrow range from mid-February to late March. In late March,
the New York Stock Exchange index was down about 9 per cent from the
January peak, while the American Exchange index--which had shown a
much larger rise in 1967--was off about 14 per cent from its high.
The volume of trading--even after normal trading hours were restored
March 4--has also moderated significantly.

Although stock prices declined on a broad front from
mid-January to mid-February, divergent changes among industry groups
subsequently appeared. By the end of March, issues in the more stable
industries--food, beverages, tobacco, and apparel--had declined signif-
icantly less than average. In contrast, stocks of industries with poor
profit records--e.g., air transport and meat packing--plus former "high
flyers"--such as electronics and motion pictures--had declined consider-
ably more than average. The flight from the less secure issues is of
course also evidenced by the American Exchange index which has declined
substantially more than other indices. The defensive attitude reflected
in these developments has been generally attributed to the course of the
Vietnam war, international monetary developments, and the increased
expectation of more restrictive public policy measures.

Falling stock prices in February evidently encouraged
additional margin traders to reduce their debt. During the month,
margin debt contracted by $90 million to $6,060 million, and the
number of margin accounts at brokerage houses declined 10,000. A
small reduction in securities loans at banks brought the total decrease
in stock market credit for the month to over $100 million. During
January and February together, therefore about 15 per cent of the
nearly $2 billion net increase in stock market credit during 1967 was
erased.
Falling stock prices also resulted in a decline in the
equity status of accounts. Although the proportion of debt in the
most vulnerable equity category--40 per cent or less--rose only 1 per
cent, the proportion in the 40-59 per cent category rose from 14 to
20 per cent. This was the highest proportion in the 40-59 per cent
category since February 1967, when the effects of the sharp 1966 stock
price declines were still in evidence.
U.S. Government securities market. Yields in all maturity
sectors of the Government securities market have risen substantially
on balance during March, but are presently well below the peak levels
reached at the height of the gold market crisis.

The sharpness of the general yield increases to March 14
reflected the growing general concern among market participants as to
the effect of the stampede into gold on domestic monetary conditions.
Dealers generally pressed to lighten their inventories of both bills
and bonds, and expectations of an increase in the Federal Reserve
discount rate to as much as 6 per cent were widespread at one point.
Liquidation of Government security holdings by investors, however,
apparently remained relatively light.
Following the discount rate increase--to 5 per cent,
announcement of the two-price system for gold, presentation of
Britain's new austerity program, and indications that some break in
the stalemate on U.S. fiscal policy might be in the offing, yields

III -18
reversed most of the very rapid increase that had occurred at the
height of the gold market crisis. Most recently, yields on Treasury
notes and bonds have edged up again as market hopes of rapid U.S.
fiscal action have lost some of their earlier conviction, and several
large new bond issues have been added to the corporate calendar.
Treasury bill yields have continued to decline, however, notwith-
standing the persistence of higher dealer financing costs.
Recent downward pressures on bill yields have reflected the
sharply reduced inventories of Government security dealers. Dealers
would normally have built up their bill inventories in anticipation
of reinvestment demands emanating from redemption of the $2 billion
of maturing March tax bills (only $900 million of which were turned
in for taxes). The uncertainties of the gold crisis period discouraged
such a build-up, however, and dealer trading positions in bills recently
dropped to an intra-weekly low of less than $500 million, more than $2
billion below the level a month ago. Treasury bills have been in demand
recently from business corporations and from institutional investors
switching out of stocks. And during March the Trading Desk has been a
net buyer of around $1 billion bills, for System and foreign accounts
combined.
With Treasury yields and the discount rate higher, yields on
short-term debt instruments other than Treasury bills have also risen
considerably on balance during March.

Participation Certificates. The Federal National Mortgage
Association offered $1 billion of participation certificates on

$200 million will mature in 3 years, $330 million in 5 years, and $200
million in 20 years. Yields were set respectively at 6.30, 6.45, and
6.45 per cent, well above the 6.00 and 6.08 per cent rates set on the
3 and 20 year maturities of FNMA PC's sold in mid-January.

Federal finance. The Treasury operating balance is
projected to total $5.0 billion at the end of March, and then to
decline seasonally to a low of about $1.5 billion around mid-April.
Thereafter, as April corporate and personal income tax payments are
collected, the balance should rise again to a month-end level of
around $4.5 billion, as shown in the financing table.
To keep its balance from falling below the $4.5 billion
level by midyear, the Treasury would have to borrow about $3.5 billion
of new cash during the last two months of this fiscal year. Part of
this cash is likely to be raised at the time of the mid-May refunding,
and another smaller part may be covered by an offering of Export-Import
Bank PC's. Because seasonal cash drains at the start of the new fiscal
year are large, an end-of-June operating balance of only $4.5 billion
is relatively low and would require sizable further Federal cash
financing sometime in July.
The preceding financing estimates are based on upward
revisions of both Treasury receipts and spending from the projection
shown in the February 28 Greenbook. The improved outlook for corporate
profits and personal income in the first half of 1968 is expected to
yield $1.0 billion more in receipts than the staff previously projected.
But this change would be largely offset by an increase in spending, as
shown in the second table.

U.S. balance of payments. Very large outpayments during March
have increased the apparent deficit substantially beyond the range indi-
cated earlier. Preliminary figures for January, February and March
through the 20th, together with known oil company payments to Libya on
the 21st and the applicable seasonal adjustment for the quarter, point
to a liquidity deficit, seasonally adjusted, of about $1-1/4 billion.
During the quarter, the German acquisition of another $125 million of
medium-term Roosa bonds was offset by other transactions in near-liquid
U.S. liabilities. The liquidity deficit before special transactions
(on the basis used in Appendix B of the January 31 green book) was
therefore about $1-1/4 billion, almost as large as the $1-1/2 billion
in the fourth quarter of 1967 and larger than the amount, under $1
billion, in the first quarter a year ago.
On the official reserve transactions basis, the seasonally
adjusted deficit in the first quarter this year is tentatively esti-
mated at about $1 billion.
Foreign trade data for January and February, discussed below,
indicate a slight improvement from the extremely unsatisfactory fourth-
quarter position. The trade surplus, however, was still at an
annual rate below $1-1/2 billion.
Tending to reduce the payments deficit as compared with the
fourth quarter, net foreign purchases of U.S. corporate stocks reached
a record monthly amount of $160 million in January, compared with an

IV -2
average of $110 million in the three preceding months. Also bank claims
on foreigners reported under the foreign credit restraint program were
reduced in both January and February, with net reflows amounting to $190
million and $90 million. And Euro-bond issues by U.S. corporations to
finance direct investments abroad, which had been $120 million in the
fourth quarter and $450 million in 1967 as a whole, increased very
sharply. Announced issues this year already exceed $550 million;
payments for these spill over partly into the second quarter.
Partly offsetting the foregoing favorable developments --
which in any case would not be sustainable over a long period -- it
is likely that there have been adverse movements of private capital in
March. These may have included shifts of funds to Canada after the
lifting of restrictions on such transfers. There may also have been
movements to Europe in the weeks when foreign exchange markets were
most disturbed. Earlier, in February, there was a sizable outflow of
bank-reported funds other than the inflow, mentioned above, of re-
payments on claims covered by the Federal Reserve program. The
difference between the total bank-reported flow and the program
figure, representing increases in claims held on behalf of U.S.
customers and in loans with Export-Import Bank participation,
guarantee, or insurance, indicates an outflow of about $140 million
during February.
U.S. foreign trade. The U.S. merchandise trade surplus in
February improved only marginally from the low January level as exports
increased slightly and imports remained unchanged, both from record

IV -3
values in January. The surplus in January and February together
averaged $1.4 billion at an annual rate (balance of payments basis),
a little higher than the exceptionally low $1.0 billion rate of the
fourth quarter but nearly $3.0 billion below the $4.0 billion rate
in the first quarter of 1967.
Imports in January-February were running at an annual rate
of $31.4 billion, about 9 per cent above the fourth quarter rate and
18 per cent higher than in the first quarter of last year. Imports
of steel and copper, the two commodities principally affected by
domestic strikes, actual or potential, continued to advance in the
first two months of the year. While the rate of advance was not
particularly large in imports of steel, purchases of foreign refined
copper in January-February were about 12 per cent greater than in the
fourth quarter of last year. Now that the 8 month old copper strike
is being settled, a gradual decline in copper imports can be anticipated
in the next few months. Steel imports, on the other hand, can be
expected to expand sharply in the next quarter.
Imports of coffee in the first two months of the year were
also appreciably higher as roasters here replenished inventories which
had been reduced to extremely low levels last fall.
A sharp spurt in automotive imports, particularly from
Canada but also from Europe and Japan, was still another component
of the record-breaking import totals of January and February. The
accelerated inflow of cars from Canada may, in part, have been in
anticipation of an automotive strike at GM plants there. The strike

IV -4
is now in its sixth week and a sharp decline in imports of cars from
Canada may therefore be expected.
Exports in January-February were at an annual rate of $32.8
billion (balance of payments basis), about 10 per cent larger than in
the fourth quarter, and 7 per cent above the rate in the corresponding
quarter of last year.
Exports of both agricultural and nonagricultural commodities
in January-February were 10 per cent above fourth quarter rates.
Shipments of agricultural products were the largest since the fourth
quarter of 1966. Deliveries of commercial passenger and combination
passenger-cargo aircraft increased sharply to an annual rate of over
$1-1/4 billion, and accounted for about one-third of the total advance
in nonagricultural exports in January-February. The current high rate
of deliveries of such aircraft is expected to be maintained throughout
the remainder of this year, but further increases are not likely.
The advances in exports in January-February were widely
distributed by areas. The greatest gains were in shipments to Canada,
Asian countries (other than Japan) and Latin America, with a more
moderate rise in exports to Japan. Shipments to Western Europe,
including the United Kingdom, were only slightly higher than in the
fourth quarter.
As part of the new balance of payments program to stimulate
exports, the President has asked Congress for a special $500 million
export financing fund to permit the Export-Import Bank to issue credit,
guarantees and insurance on export transactions that do not meet the

IV -5
Bank's criteria of a reasonable assurance of repayment. He has also
requested $2.5 million for the Department of Commerce's joint-export
association program, to help finance joint operations by U.S. companies
in export advertising, market research, sales and warehousing.
Gold. The termination of gold pool activities after March 15
and the communique issued by the March 16-17 meeting of central bank
governors of seven gold pool members will be the subject of a separate
memorandum.
Following a decline of $165 million in the total U.S. gold
stock in January and February, the daily reported Treasury gold stock
fell further by $1,398 million to March 22. Most of this represented
gold pool settlements and sales to foreign central banks, so that Exchange
Stabilization Fund holdings were only moderately replenished.
This gold drain served to hold down the net additions during
March to foreign official claims on the United States to a very small
total, if any. From the U.S. point of view the gold drain thus represented
a means of financing the deficit. However, from the point of view of
other countries whose residents were moving out of domestic-currency
assets to buy gold, such private gold transactions tended to worsen
those countries' balances of payments or hold down surpluses. How large
an element in the total gold buying such foreign private purchases were
can not be said, on the basis of presently available information. The
possibility should not be overlooked that U.S. residents may have partici-
pated also.
Euro-dollar market developments. Euro-dollar interest rates,
after dropping back in January to levels comparable with last October's,

IV -6
began to move up again in late February, and more sharply in March.
The 3-month rate reached its peak on Thursday, March 14, at 7-1/8 per
cent, up 1-7/16 from March 1, This peak rate was the highest since
November of 1966. Rate movements in the one-, six-, and twelve-month
maturities were similar, as indicated in the table.

Among the factors affecting Euro-dollar rates during the first
two weeks of March may have been the following: (1) a reduced demand for
dollar-denominated assets in general, related to growing international
monetary uncertainties; (2) an increased demand for dollars with which to
buy gold; (3) withdrawals by German banks to meet mid-March liquidity
pressures in the German money market; and (4) bidding for deposits by U.S.
banks' branches, which produced a rise of nearly $300 million in head
office liabilities to branches in the week ending March 13. In addition,
the request by the Bank of Canada on March 4 that Canadian banks cease
swap dollar deposit transactions may have operated to reduce the supply
of funds in the Euro-dollar market, but no information is as yet available
on Canadian bank activity during the period in question.

IV -7
The Euro-dollar market was significantly influenced by the
great uncertainty attached to holding dollar denominated assets which
developed over the two weeks prior to March 15. During the week of
March 11 to March 15 the cost of covering new placements of funds in
dollar assets (or rolling over cover for reinvestment in maturing dollar
assets) became very high. For example, the per annum cost of forward
covering of dollars against Swiss francs rose from 2.1 per cent on
March 1 to 3.5 per cent on March 14. The rise in three-month Euro-dollar
interest rates was just about equal to this increase in the cost of for-
ward covering.
Following the March 16-17 weekend change in gold policy, Euro-
dollar rates moved down. From Thursday March 14 to Tuesday March 26
the rates on one-, three-, six-, and twelve-month deposits fell by an
average of 74 basis points, but remained an average of 52 basis points
above their March 1 levels.
The general reduction in rates in the past two weeks may be
explained by a cessation of such pressures as those mentioned above.
The liabilities of U.S. banks to their branches abroad fell by $375
million in the week to March 20. It may well be that the U.S. banks had
had their branches borrow in the Euro-dollar market the week before in
order to prepare against large withdrawals by branch customers; the
branches retained the funds temporarily as balances with head offices.
To the extent that foreigners did move out of Euro-dollar deposits, or
borrowed Euro-dollars -- to buy gold, or to buy assets being sold by
gold purchasers, or perhaps to acquire German marks -- the running down

IV -8
of branch balances in the United States after the 13th enabled the
pressures on the Euro-dollar market to be absorbed without even greater
rate advances than occurred. The pressures on the market reached their
peak on the 14th, the day before the London market was closed.
Data are not available to indicate what other flows in or out
of the Euro-dollar market have occurred this month. The Bundesbank
entered into additional dollar-mark swaps with German commercial banks,
but net changes in outstanding swaps and in the banks' net external
assets are not known. It is possible that proceeds of new Euro-bond
issues were put into Euro-dollar deposits, but here again figures are
lacking. Preliminary and incomplete data suggest that changes during
the month in U.S. liquid liabilities to private foreign persons and
commercial banks other than the U.S. branches were relatively small.

IV -9
Foreign trade of industrialized countries. International
trade began to rise again in the fourth quarter of 1967, after a pause
in the first three quarters of the year. The recession in Germany
from mid-1966 to mid-1967, the slight decline in U.S. industrial pro-
duction during the first half of 1967, and the British measures to deal
with the balance of payments had been the principal retarding influences
on world trade. Most European countries -- apart from Germany -- took
little or no action to offset the deflationary effect of slackening
foreign demand for fear of causing a loss of foreign exchange reserves
or a new break-out of inflationary pressures in their economies. As
a result, the value of world exports was only 3 per cent higher in the
third quarter of 1967 than in the third quarter of 1966 -- after an in-
crease of 10 per cent the year before -- and in fact growth had ceased
by early 1967.
The upturn in world trade in the fourth quarter reflected sharp
increases in imports of the United States and Germany and of some of
Germany's neighbors. Meanwhile Japanese and Italian imports were con-
tinuing to rise strongly. As the following table shows, total imports
of OECD countries -- including all the principal industrial countries
and some smaller European countries -- rose 4 per cent from the third
quarter to the fourth, with accelerated buying from each other and also
from the rest of the world.
The rise in exports of OECD countries was smaller than the in-
crease in their imports. Among individual countries, this was markedly
the case for the United States and Germany, the two countries whose

IV -10
rising imports were giving the main impetus to growth in world trade.
But in several European countries, exports and imports rose more or less
in step, while in two instances, in Canada and Switzerland, exports turned
up sooner and rose more than imports. Britain was a special case, with
deterioration in its trade balance (in terms of U.S. dollars) caused
mainly by a drop in exports.

The over-all shrinkage in the export surplus of the industrial
countries reflected a decline in their exports to non-OECD countries. This
export decline was concentrated in British exports; the initial effect of
devaluation was to lower the dollar value of British exports, and the dock
strike was another factor in the fourth quarter. Exports of other OECD
countries to non-OECD areas were relatively level during the latter part
of 1967.
It has generally been expected that 1968 will be a year of
large expansion in world trade. Clearly the rise that has already
occurred in imports of OECD member countries is enough to make total

IV -11
imports this year considerably greater than last year's. Also, buy-
ing by the less developed countries is likely to expand, as a result
not only of the rise in their export earnings in recent months but also
of a considerable increase in their foreign exchange reserves over
the past three years -- from $9.5 billion at the end of 1964 to $12.3
billion last December, according to an IMF estimate.
Uncertainties about the course of world trade within the
year 1968 relate primarily to whether the further expansion of demand
in Germany and other European countries will be enough to counter-
balance any slackening that may develop in U.S. and U.K. imports. If
over-all growth is maintained, the tariff reductions which will take
place this year should help expand international trade. In January
the U.S. reduced its tariffs by 20 per cent of the total reduction
agreed upon in the Kennedy Round; European signatories to the agree-
ment will reduce their tariffs by 40 per cent of the total in July,
Also, in July,the remaining internal EEC tariffs will be abolished,
and the EEC common external tariff will go into effect, necessitating
additional tariff cuts in outside trade by France and Italy. German
external tariffs are on the whole already at the appropriate level;
Belgium and the Netherlands will have to make general upward adjust-
ments of their tariffs.
In Britain, prospects for a substantial narrowing in the
trade deficit during the balance of 1968 are considered good, despite
the persistence of large trade deficits since the devaluation. The
favorable impact of the devaluation is expected to be felt increasingly
as the year progresses.

IV 12
The monthly trade deficit (imports, c.i.f.) in December-
February averaged a little over $300 million, compared with $216 million
in the first three quarters of 1967. The October-November results had
been even worse, partly because exports were hit especially badly by the
dock strikes in those months.
One important reason for the sizable U.K. trade deficits
since devaluation has been the relative movement of U.K. export and
import prices. As measured in sterling terms, the published unit value
indexes rose from September to January by 9 per cent for imports but by
only 4 per cent for exports. The dollar equivalents were a 7 per cent
decline in import prices and an 11 per cent decline for export prices,
Relative changes of this sort are counted on eventually to restrain
import buying and to promote growth of export volume, but the initial
effects are unfavorable.
In volume terms, exports did pick up sharply in December and
January, but this rise seems to have been partly a catching up after
delivery delays during the dock strikes. The December-January average
volume (seasonally adjusted) was slightly above the peak reached in
the first quarter of 1967. Import volume in December-January was
higher than in any two or three-month period last year, and there
appears to have been a further rise in February. Probably imports
have been stimulated by the increased stock building associated with
economic recovery, as well as by stepped-up purchases of consumer goods
from abroad connected with the consumer spending spree of recent months.

IV -13
Optimism that the deficit will be drastically reduced in the
remainder of 1968 rests on the likelihood (a) that import demand will
be curtailed as a result of the restrictive budget and (b) that the
combination of revived foreign demand and lower foreign currency prices
of British goods will soon bring about a rapid increase in U.K. exports.
There are encouraging indications that exporters are taking
advantage of the devaluation by making significant cuts in the foreign
exchange prices of their goods. A recent survey by the Confederation
of British Industry forecast an average export price reduction of about
8 per cent. While this is less than the decline shown by unit value
indexes through January, the figures are not inconsistent in view of
rising costs of materials. British exporters appear sanguine about
their 1968 prospects. The National Institute's Industrial Inquiry in
December found that the machinery, automobile, and chemical industries --
accounting for over half of Britain's total exports -- expected a
marked improvement in their sales abroad this year.
The strength of German economic growth, important because
of the significance of Germany as an export market for other European
countries as well as for the United States, will be an important
determinant of world trade expansion in 1968. German economic activity
continued to advance strongly at the opening of 1968. Order inflows to
industry, both domestic and foreign, but particularly domestic, rose
sharply through December. Industrial production has risen steeply
since mid-1967; in the fourth quarter it averaged 9 per cent above
the second quarter. In January output fell back from the sharply

IV -14
advanced December level, but was about equal to the October-November
average. The number of workers unemployed dropped slightly below the
number of registered job vacancies in January (seasonally adjusted) for
the first time since the beginning of 1967.
The rise in German imports so far has been concentrated in
raw materials and semi-finished products, as producers have sought to
rebuild inventories from the low levels to which they had been allowed
to fall through the first part of 1967. Germany's EEC partners and
the EFTA countries have shared in the growth of sales to Germany, but
suppliers of raw materials -- particularly Australia and New Zealand,
Canada, Africa and Asia -- have gained the most in relative terms.
In France, there was a pick-up in economic activity in the
second half of 1967 following the unexpected and disappointing slow-
down of the economy earlier in the year. Imports, after having dropped
sharply in the second quarter in reaction to the slowing in the French
economy, moved up in September to a new high level and have been
maintained near that level in subsequent months. Exports also rose
strongly in September after an indifferent performance in the first
eight months of 1967, and moved higher again in January and February.
The predominant factor in the export revival has been the German
recovery. Exports and imports both expected to expand by 7.5 per
cent from 1967 to 1968, after growth from 1966 to 1967 at 4.1 and
4.3 per cent, respectively.
The main features of Italy's foreign trade in recent months
were a sharp recovery of exports following last summer's slump and a

IV -15
further acceleration of the long-continued rise in imports. The sharp
rise in Italian exports in the fourth quarter and January appears to
have resulted at least partly from a substantial increase in exports
to Germany. A sharp import drop occurred in January, but this seems
to have been a freak occurrence; economic activity and imports are
expected to expand strongly in 1968 as a whole.
Canada's trade balance improved sharply in the fourth quarter,
as exports rose about 10 per cent while imports declined 2 per cent.
The decline in Canadian imports in the third and fourth quarters and
the small rise for the year as a whole reflected a lack of buoyancy in
the economy. Forecasts indicate that demand will grow only moderately
in 1968, suggesting a rather modest growth of imports beyond that
dictated by the automobile pact with the United States.
Canada's 1967 export performance was largely determined by
special developments in its trade with us. The primary force behind
the growth of Canadian exports was the continued adjustment of the
automobile industry to the 1965 pact. Exports of copper also grew
very strongly as a result of the U.S. copper strike.
Japanese exports were markedly higher in January-February
than in preceding months. Imports, on the other hand, were somewhat
below their November-December peak level.
The Japanese Government's import projection for the fiscal
year beginning April 1, as revised late in January, forsees average
imports 8.6 per cent above those in the 1967-1968 fiscal year now
ending. Since the January-February level is already about 3 per cent

IV -16
above the fiscal year average, this implies only a moderate rise from
now on -- much slower than what occurred during 1966 and 1967, when
Japanese imports rose more than 50 per cent in 2 years from late 1965.
However, as has often been the case before, the import projection may
be an underestimate.
The Japanese authorities look for a 15 per cent fiscal-year-
to-fiscal-year rise in exports, reducing but not eliminating the
Japanese trade deficit (with c.i.f. imports).

APPENDIX A: MARKET YIELDS AND NONBANK DEPOSITARY INFLOWS*
The approaching March-April reinvestment period at the
savings and loan associations and mutual savings banks once again
poses the question of the ability of nonbank financial institutions to
capture funds and extend credit under current market conditions. In
summary, this appendix concludes the following:
1. Although rising market rates of interest increas-
ingly have been pinching the inflows of funds to
nonbank thrift institutions, the ceiling rate on
consumer-type time deposits at commercial banks and
the increased use of certificate accounts at savings
and loan associations should moderate the impact of
additional monetary restraint on depositary inflows
as a whole.
2. Nevertheless, at current rate ceilings on nonbank
financial institutions a significant further slow-
down of inflows is likely to be produced at the
level of market yields now available (e.g. a
5.10 per cent 90-day bill rate).
3. The cost of a 25 basis point increase in offering
rates on certificate-type accounts, under revised
ceilings, could be absorbed by most nonbank inter-
mediaries, but not without an increase in the number
of institutions who would fail to meet required
allocations of earnings to reserves.
1966 vs. 1968
For a number of reasons, thrift institutions as a whole appear
to be somewhat less vulnerable to intensified monetary restraint than in
1966--the last period when inflows to these institutions were reduced
sharply.
During the earlier period, a large proportion of the reduced
inflows to nonbank financial institutions--perhaps as much as two-fifths--
reflected their altered competitive position position vis-a-vis commercial
banks, whose rates to depositors rose appreciably during the first half
Prepared by the Capital Markets Section.

of 1966 when market yields were also rising sharply. Consumer-type
time deposits at commercial banks are highly substitutable for both
savings and loan shares and savings bank deposits, and the increase in
commercial bank offering rates in 1966 helped the banks pull funds out
of the nonbank institutions. These increases at banks also helped to
reduce the relative impact of rising market yields on commercial bank
deposit inflows.
The ceiling rates established in the fall of 1966 stemmed
this tide and, as shown in chart 1, by 1967 the commercial bank share of
household acquisition of interest-bearing deposits settled back to about
pre-1966 levels, although the share remained above that obtained when
banks were less active in the market for consumer time deposits. Thus,
under present ceiling limits, inflows to nonbank institutions will be
affected principally by the pull of market rates, rather than by inter-
institutional competition.
In addition, the savings and loan associations have now greatly
increased the use of minimum term-minimum balance certificate accounts
at rates above those paid on regular accounts. In the first half of
1967, for example, about three-fourths of net increase in savings and
loan share capital as accounted for by special accounts.- Moreover,
in early 1968 such special accounts--because of their staggered
maturities--apparently tended to reduce the oncentration of withdrawals
that might otherwise have occurred in a single reinvestment period.
Further, intermediaries are now in a much better position to
weather reduced inflows and to meet their present high level of out-
standing commitments than in 1966. Savings and loan associations have
reduced their borrowing from the FHLB's by $2.8 billion and both the
associations and savings banks have increased their holdings of liquid
assets.
Some have also argued that there is less "hot money" at
nonbank intermediaries now than was the case in early 1966. However,
the degree of change may not be significant enough to be particularly
meaningful at all institutions. For example, although the California
savings and loan associations have somewhat reduced the share of savings
capital from out-of-state funds, such interest-sensitive accounts still
represent a large proportion of the total. /
1/ This overstates the effect on inflows since some regular accounts
were transferred to special accounts.
2/ At the State-chartered savings and loan associations in California,
out-of-state funds have declined from 23.5 per cent of the total in
the fall of 1965 to 21.0 per cent in the fall of 1967. In December,
the ratio rose to 21.9 per cent. Federally-chartered associations
have lower ratios, but would show the same trend.

Another factor on the other side of the ledger is that mutual
savings banks are now perhaps more exposed to rising market yields than
they were in 1966; at that time they were able to accelerate inflows by
raising rates at mid-year. Under current rate ceilings,not only do
they have less room to maneuver, but unlike theircompetition, they
cannot offer premium accounts above the passbook rate to retain and
attract the most interest-sensitive deposits.
Past relationships
Although the factors just discussed tend to make it more
difficult to read the future from the past, relationships during earlier
years are still indicative of the effects of rising market yields on
intermediary flows.
To illustrate the relationship in recent years, charts 2, 3,
and 4 relate the quarterly spread between the 3-month bill rate and the
average effective rate paid on nonbank claims--shown in the upper panel--
to the inflow of funds to these institutions--shown in the lower panel.
In each case the bill rate serves as a proxy for market interest rates
in general. These harts show that as the yield spreads between average
offerings rates and market instruments narrow the inflow of funds to
the institutions declines. However, while these charts are suggestive,
institutional changes and data limitations reduce our ability to make
quantitative preductions based on them. The rate relationships are
calculated from quarterly interpolated average effective rates paid by
intermediaries--the only series available for the entire time period.
This series tends to lag offering rates and does not reflect the
(supposedly) larger volume of fund flows associated with the highest
rates being offered by the intermediaries.
Staff analysis (by Mr. Wendel)--using identical data--suggests
that a 1 percentage point decrease in the yield spreads shown on the
charts has been associated with reduced inflows to all nonbank inter-
mediaries by about $7 billion (annual rate). This preliminary statistical
relationship is also suggestive but--like the charts--suffers from the
problems arising out of institutional changes- and data limitations.

Recent and prospective developments
During the recent December-January reinvestment period, bill
yields exceeded the average effective rate on savings and loan shares
by 35 basis points and that on savings bank deposits by 20 basis points.
Although depositary inflows did moderate, the deceleration was not so
great as would have been expected from the 1966 experience alone. At
this writing (just prior to the March-April reinvestment period), the
3-month bill rate at about 5.10 per cent is 35 to 45 basis points above
the average effective rate paid on nonbank claims--a spread only somewhat lower
thanatthe height of the pressures experienced in 1966. But the change
in basic competitive factors, mentioned earlier, the high pace of personal
savings, and the reduced volume of new security issues have so far tended
to temper the effect of market yields on inflows.
However, the additional accommodation possible before a more
pronounced effect from higher market yields is felt is now probably
quite small. As seen in chart 5, market yields are now at or above the
highest permissible rates that savings and loans may pay and they exceed
the maximum rate that mutual savings and ommercial banks may pay.
Moreover, based on the latest data available, a large proportion of inter-
mediary funds are already earning the ceiling rate. To be sure, among
associations outside California only an estimated one-third of share
capital in regular and non-regular form is at the maximum rate. But,
almost three-fourths of deposits at all savings banks and essentially
all accounts at California and other Western savings and loans are
already receiving the highest permissible rate. Moreover, it is entirely
possible that those associations with room to raise their offering rates
are in areas where interest rate competition is nominal. If it is
assumed that the more sensitive institutions--the ones already at the
ceiling--will be most affected by rising market yields, the number of
institutions with room to raise rates may not be extremely significant
in projecting future intermediary flows.
4/ In general, prevailing ceiling rates are as follows: For mutual
savings banks, 5 per cent with no arrangement for special rates on
differentiated accounts. For most savings and loan associations,
4-3/4 per cent on passbook accounts and 5-1/4 on certificate accounts
of 6-month or longer. California and ertain other Western associa-
tions may generally pay 5 per cent on passbook accounts but if they
pay this rate--which most do--they may only offer 5-1/4 per cent on
certificateswith minimum maturity of 3 years. There are a great
number of other small exceptions throughout the rest of the country.
Commercial banks may pay 5 per cent for time deposits in denominations
of less than $100,000. This rate may be offered for maturities down
to 90 days.

A-10
Thus, despite the differences from 1966, it is quite likely
that if further increases in market yields occur they may generate a
significant reduction of inflows to nonbank intermediaries--particularly
at the savings banks in New York and the savings and loan associations
in California, both groups of which generally have little or no room to
raise offering rates. Indeed, current market yields in the short- and
intermediate-term spectrum are only marginally below, and long-term
yields are already above, 1966 peaks and California associations and
New York savings banks can now offer less than they could at that time;
moreover, California associations now can only pay their highest rates
for 3-year maturities. This does not mean that inflows will decline
to the levels of 1966--for the reasons mentioned earlier--but nonetheless
inflows probably will decline significantly and have already fallen to
the pace of late 1965 and early 1966. Even with the decline in money
market yields in late March it is quite likely that nonbank institutions
in the coming arch-April reinvestment period will experience outflows
of a size second only to 1966. I California, outflows may even be
larger than in 1966 because of a large increase--of at least 100 per cent--
in State income tax payments due April 15.
Rate ceiling on thrift institutions
Can thrift institutions afford to pay higher rates--under
revised ceilings--if market yields continue to press hard on their inflows?
As can be seen in Table 1, the higher level of rates on new mortgages
has operated to increase the gross return on total institutional mortgage
portfolios in recent years and the staff projects some further accelerations
in gross returns for the current calendar year.

Note: FR estimates based so far as possible on FHLBB data on contract rates
reported for conventional first mortgages made on new and existing homes by
each of the institutional groups shown separately. Estimates now understate
actual levels in all cases particularly because they do not reflect
differences in the composition of mortgage portfolios between home and
income properties or in fees and charges. The relative differences
indicated for the individual groups largely reflect substantial variations
in their mortgage-portfolio turnover rates. Such rates are highest for
commercial banks, mainly because of the heavy incidence of relatively
short-term construction loans, and lowest for mutuals.
5/ The decline in the bill rate has been largely technical and at the
current time may not be indicative of market yields in general.

A-11
But as shown in Table 2, the rate of return to intermediaries on all
assets--after all expenses including dividends and interest credited--
has declined consistently since 1964, as the cost of obtaining and
holding all deposits has risen still faster.

For the most recent period the "net profit" rate of thrift institutions
has declined to post-war lows. Moreover, FHLB System member associations
must allocate a certain percentage of net income to reserves. Generally,
10 per cent of net income must be so allocated, although the Board has
temporarily reduced the percentage requirement for slow growing associa-
tions to 5 per cent. As indicated by Table 3, however, in the second
half of 1967 almost 3 per cent of all insured associations paid dividends
in excess of their income, and an additional 6 per cent or so could not
meet even the 5 per cent requirement. Altogether, about one-third of
the institutions were at or below a level of net income which would permit

A-12
meeting the 10 per cent requirement from current operations. Those
institutions not able to meet even the reduced requirement out of
income were forced to transfer funds from surplus accounts to reserves--
a source that for many of them is quite limited.

Thus, even with higher returns on mortgages and other investments,
the ability of savings and loans to offer higher rates for funds is
limited. According to FHLBB staff estimates, an across the board increase
of 25 basis points on all share capital--abstracting from offsetting
increases in income or reductions in expenditures--would cost about
5 per cent of net income. Under these circumstances, an additional one-
fourth or more of associations would have difficulty meeting even the
5 per cent reserve allocation requirement without dipping into surplus.
A 25 basis point increase in the cost of certificate accounts alone would,
of course, not have such a sharp impact. Assuming that transfers from
regular to certificate accounts--as well as new inflows--raise the share
of total capital in the form of certificate accounts to 25 per cent from
the 15 per cent in mid-1967, total dividend costs would rise by 9 basis
points--equivalent to about 2 per cent of the net income of associations,
according to the FHLBB.
Moreover, the FHLBB staff estimates that increases in gross
portfolio returns and reductions in expenses might offset a fairly
substantial porportion of the increased dividend cost of a 25 basis point
increase in certificate rates, but would offset only a small proportion

A-13
of the effect of a 25 basis point across the board increase in rates.
But, they caution in their conclusion, even the former case would produce
a "substantial" increase in the number of associations failing to meet
reserve allocations from operations.
Mutual savings banks are generally required by State law to
maintain minimum surplus-to-deposit ratios. In the event that these
ratios are not met the banks are required to allocate a specified
proportion of their income to surplus accounts. Unfortunately, data
availability does not permit a quantification of the number of institutions
that are currently below minimum ratios or the number of institutions who
are unable to meet the minimum allocation to surplus our of current
income. In New York State, however, the average surplus-to-deposit ratio
is below the specified minimum and there are indications that at least
some have been unable to make the minimum appropriations fromcurrent
income.' Thus, like the savings and loans, an increase in the cost of
deposits--even with higher yields on new portfolio acquisitions--would
place at least some savings banks in a profits squeeze.
Yet no change in present ceilings also entails some risk. For
if rising market yields substantially reduce nonbank institutions' inflows,
not only would mortgage credit be severely reduced but the improved
liquidity position of many institutions might also tend to deteriorate
rapidly. Borrowing by savings and loans from the FHLB would then rise
to cover not only mortgage commitments already made but also withdrawals.
In terms of the dilemma thus raised, an increase in the maximum
rate on certificate-type accounts would at least serve two purposes. It
would allow the institutions at the margin to reduce the effect of rising
market yields on the availability of mortgage funds and on their liquidity.
Second, it would help to minimize the over-all interest expense for those
intermediaries who found it possible to take advantage of it. This would
be particularly useful for the savings banks which are not able currently
to realistically differentiate their accounts and to marginal savings and
loan institutions that may already be near the brink of insolvency. How-
ever, even the resultant small net increase in interest cost would tend
to increase the number of institutions unable to meet their reserve
allocations from operations.
6/ In New York State, the legislature has already passed an amendment
to the current regulations reducing the minimum required surplus-to-
deposit ratio from 10 to 8 per cent. In 1967, many institutions in
New York had ratios below 8 per cent and nearly all were below
10 per cent.

APPENDIX B: TAX STATUS OF INDUSTRIAL AID BONDS*
The tax exempt status of industrial aid bonds is still far
from settled, but several recent developments in the continuing contro-
versy deserve attention. On March 6, 1968, the Treasury announced that
after March 15, 1960, all State and local governmental authority bonds
issued to finance private industrial facilities would be subject to
Federal income taxes. In order to beat the deadline, more than $200
million of such bonds were subsequently rushed to market.
Substantial Congressional pressure resulted in the Treasury
temporarily abandoning its initial proposal, however, and it belatedly
substituted a set of regulations designed to provide a six-month
transitional period. In this latest version, tax exemption would be
permitted for industrial aid bonds sold by September 15, 1968, if these
bonds met any of four conditions as of March 15, 1968. These conditions
are:
1) The issue was approved by voters of the governmental
unit involved.
2) A "significant financial commitment" had been made by
the governmental unit.
3) A "binding contract" had been made by private parties
involved in the issue.
4) Federal or state financial assistance for projects
"concerned with economic development" had been approved
or an application for such assistance was pending.
Hearings concerning these proposals were scheduled for May.
Congressional criticisms was not placated by these proposals
and on March 26 the Senate voted to prohibit the Treasury from taking
action on this matter without specific congressional authority. It is
possible that the House may soon join the Senate in passing a similar
bill. It is rumored that a compromise solution may then be forthcoming
which would permit economically depressed areas, as designated by the
Commerce Department, to continue offering industrial aid bonds on a
tax-exempt basis.
* Prepared by James L. Kichline, Economist, Capital Markets Section.

B-2
Given the current status of the issue, a significant volume
of near-term sales of industrial bonds are highly unlikely. Under-
writers are reluctant to undertake commitments until the matter is
clarified. Moreover, even if Congressional action to restrain the
Treasury from independently removing tax-exempt privileges on these
bonds is approved, the sizeable volume of issues that came to market
prior to March 15 largely exhausted offerings that were in an advanced
planning stage.

APPENDIX : THE BRITISH BUDGET 1/
The British government took decisive action last week to curb con-
sumer demand by imposing a variety of tax increases and announcing plans
to limit rises in wages and other forms of income to 3-1/2 per cent a year.
Consumer expenditures have been increasing rapidly since mid-1967 and, since
the devaluation, have jeopardized the effort to transfer resources into areas
of benefit to the balance of payments.
The restrictive program was disclosed on March 19 by Chancellor
of the Exchequer Jenkins in his presentation to Parliament of the Government's
budget for the fiscal year beginning April 1.
The projected spending and revenue totals in the budget indicate
the extent to which the government has moved in the direction of fiscal re-
straint. Expenditures in 1968-69 are scheduled to increase about 4 per cent
over the estimated total for the current fiscal year, while revenue is
slated to rise approximately 6.5 per cent. As a result, the government ex-
pects to run a surplus of almost £1.4 billion in the next fiscal year, com-
pared to one of about £300 million this year.
Because the government plans virtually no increase in net outlays
for loans -- most of which are made to local authorities and nationalized
industries -- its borrowing requirement will be reduced to about £360 million
in 1968-69, from about £1.45 billion in 1967-68. The amount the government
intends to borrow, incidentally, is only about a third of the £1 billion
borrowing maximum to which the Labor Government committed itself in negotiating
the $1.4 billion standby assistance agreement with the IMF in November.
Since the government's spending plans had been made public earlier
this year,attention last week was focused on the revenue side of the budget.
Most of the increase in the government's intake next year will be obtained
through higher indirect taxes. Duties on gambling, alcoholic beverages (ex-
cluding beer), tobacco and gasoline were raised, as were purchase taxes on a
large array of consumer goods, ranging from necessities such as clothing to
luxuries such as jewelry. These increases, together with boosts in licensing
fees for motor vehicles, are expected to add about £400 million to the govern-
ment's tax take in fiscal 1968-69.
The only major change in direct taxation announced on March 19 was
a progressive levy on investment income in excess of £3,000. Imposed for
only one year and expected to yield £70 million in 1968-69, this tax is likely
to have minimal effects on consumption. It was probably included for the
political purpose of demonstrating the government's willingness to deal harshly
also with the rich.

Section, Division of International Finance.

C-2
Standard income tax rates were not altered. However, in order
to offset a three shilling increase in family allowances which was announced
in the Chancellor's speech on the 19th and which will take effect in October,
allowable tax deductions for children will be reduced. Family allowances
are already scheduled to rise seven shillings in April, and the increase in
October is apparently intended to make the austerity measures announced last
week somewhat more palatable to lower income groups.
The government estimates that the new tax measures announced in
the budget speech will increase revenue in fiscal 1968-69 by £671 million
over what it otherwise would have been. On a full year basis, the estimated
increase is £766 million. The discrepancy between the two figures arises
from the fact that not all of the tax changes will be imposed immediately
and not all will exert their full effect in fiscal 1968-69.
When tax increases previously announced are taken into account --
most notably the rise in the corporation income tax rate from 40 to 42-1/2
per cent -- the net increment to revenue is expected to be £775 million in
the forthcoming fiscal year and £923 million on a full year basis -- equal
to a little less than 3 per cent of national income.
Cutback in consumption is a prime goal
The overriding objective of the new revenue measures is to restrict
the volume of consumption and to free resources for use in expansion of ex-
ports and private business investment. The Chancellor on March 19 reiterated
the goal of £500 million a year surpluses in the balance of payments, predict-
ing that the basic balance would move into the black in the second half of
1968 and would reach an annual rate of £500 million some time in 1969. He
asserted that a prerequisite of this aimed-for improvement was a reduction
in real consumption, hammering home the point that the success of the de-
valuation requires a temporary decline in the standard of living.
According to the latest official government forecast -- which takes
into account the effects of the budget and the restrictive measures presented
with it -- real consumption in the second half of 1968 will be about 2 per
cent lower than it was in the second half of 1967. A slight rise is fore-
seen in the first half of 1969, but it is expected that consumption will
remain lower, by over 1.5 per cent, in that period than in the second half
of last year.
The government makes no claim for precision in these forecasts,
offering them only as mid-points in wide ranges of possibilities. However,
it is indeed likely that the budget, combined with wage restraints, will
decrease consumption from current levels. Even without further taxation,
prices were expected to rise about 5.5 per cent during 1963. Since the in-
direct taxes imposed last week will undoubtedly be passed on in the form of
higher prices, the rate of increase will now be greater. Assuming that
wage rises will be successfully limited to 3-1/2 per cent, it is unlikely
that annual earnings -- after allowing for more overtime and the emergence

C -3
of wage drift as economic recovery progresses -- will rise by more than
5.5 per cent. Since other forms of personal income are unlikely to in-
crease more rapidly, real disposable income should fall. With no change --
or a rise -- in the proportion of income saved, real consumption would
also fall.
A decline in the savings ratio seems unlikely at this juncture.
A decrease has taken place since the middle of 1967. However, that decrease
was associated first with the easing of installment buying regulations in
June and August and, after the devaluation, with efforts to beat higher
prices and new restrictions on consumer buying. Now that consumers have an
increased backlog of installment debt to pay off and now that they know
the government's stabilization program, the odds favor a rise in the savings
ratio.
Overall growth goal is now only 3 per cent
On the strength of the budget and a more rigorous incomes policy,
and in view of the general prospects for world trade, the government expects
national income in real terms to grow at an annual rate of only about 3 per
cent from the second half of 1967 to the first half of 1969. Only if exports
grow more rapidly than expected -- an obviously desirable development -- is
growth in excess of 3 per cent likely.
It had been widely anticipated that, despite admonitions --
particularly from Britain's creditors abroad -- to limit growth to 3 per
cent a year, a target of at least 4 per cent would be adopted. Thus, in
electing to hold expansion to the 3 per cent rate, the British -- as no
doubt was their intention -- have done much to reassure the financial com-
munity about their determination to insure the success of the devaluation
through the preservation of a large margin of slack in the economy. At
the rate of growth now contemplated, the unemployment rate will probably
not decline very much from its currently high level of over 2 per cent.
The modest expansion that is scheduled to take place will be
export-led, with exports of goods and services slated to be the fastest
growing sector in national income. Fixed investment ranks second with
regard to projected rates of growth. Current expenditures on goods and
services by public authorities will increase, but less rapidly than national
income as a whole. Consumption, as was noted, is expected to fall during
the rest of this year.
Union opposition to stabilization measures is a threat
The government's moves last week significantly enhanced the
prospects that the devaluation will succeed. However, introduction of the
severe austerity program entails risks. Perhaps the main domestic threat
to the campaign to bring about permanent improvement in Britain's balance
of payments is the possibility that labor union defiance of the government's
restrictive measures -- principally those on wage increases -- could seriously

disrupt economic activity. Strikes have dealt crippling blows to Britain's
trade account in the past and could conceivably do so again.
The government plans to expand its statutory powers so that it
may delay wage and price rises it considers unwarranted by twelve rather
than seven months. Details have not yet been published. Presumably when
the government rejects a settlement for violating the 3-1/2 per cent ceiling
it will have the authority to freeze wages at their existing level for as
long as a year. However, the government has not indicated that it will
request powers to ban work stoppages.
To make its restrictions on wages more acceptable to labor, the
government has applied the 3-1/2 per cent ceiling to dividends also. Further-
more, it has stated its intention of blocking price, as well as well as
wage, hikes it deems unjustified. However, it remains to be seen whether
such moves will be sufficient to placate the more militant segments of the
labor movement. Strong antagonism toward restrictions on wage settlements
was evident at the conference of trade union executives last month and had
much to do with the government's decision to abandon efforts to keep wage
rises within acceptable limits through greater cooperation with labor unions
rather than more stringent controls. A particular threat to the government's
wage restraint program is posed by the contract negotiations this year in-
volving the claims of about 2.5 million engineering workers, over a million
of whom belong to the militant Amalgamated Engineering Union.
At the moment, however, the government appears confident that its
program will succeed. This was implicit, for example, in the Bank of
England's reduction of its discount rate on March 21 from 8 to 7-1/2 per
cent. Bank Race had been raised from 6-1/2 to 8 per cent when the pound was
devalued in November.
