I-1
SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK
Outlook for economic activity
Continued rapid expansion in over-all economic activity
in the second quarter, maintaining pressure on prices and resources,
is foreshadowed by the recent surge in final sales, the rise in new
orders, the reduced inventory/sales position and expected gains in
incomes. In addition, expenditures for defense are expected to rise
at rates well above those indicated in the Budget, and more in line
with the increases indicated by the President at the end of March.
Real GNP growth should again approximate the rapid 6 per cent rate
of the first quarter, and the over-all price increase (GNP deflator)
should continue at about the recent 4 per cent rate.
Recent tightening in monetary policy is not expected to
cause any significant slowing in the economy this quarter, except
possibly in housing starts toward the end of the quarter. While
the most recent McGraw-Hill Survey (to be released April 26) suggests
an 8 per cent increase in plant and equipment expenditures for 1968,
somewhat higher than the earlier Commerce-SEC survey, this is not
likely to show up in second quarter expenditures. The increase in
investment plans could mark the start of an acceleration in business
outlays, but higher interest rates and more limited availability
of funds could dampen any surge in capital spending, particularly
in the commercial construction area.

I-2
Outlook for resource use and prices
Industrial production advanced at a moderate pace in the
first quarter, increasing at an annual rate of more than 5 per cent
from the fourth quarter average. Further advance in industrial
production would naturally be associated with the projected continued
rapid rise in real GNP in the current quarter, particularly since
business inventory demands are likely to be heightened after the
unexpected sharp drop in the rate of accumulation in the first
quarter. Manufacturing capacity utilization would, however, remain
at about the moderate 84 per cent rate prevailing, on average, since
mid-1967.
Recently monthly increases in productivity have been modest
while wage rates have continued to move up rapidly. The labor market
has continued tight, with employment gains sizable--particularly in
nonmanufacturing industries--and unemployment averaging an extremely
low 3.6 per cent in the first quarter. Recent wage settlements have
provided wage and fringe benefits of 6 to 7 per cent or more a year--
with pressures for such large settlements stemming in part from the
persistent rapid increases in the cost of living. There is no let-up
in sight for over-all pressure on labor resources. Unemployment may
decline slightly further this spring (barring protracted strikes),
upward pressure on wages will continue strong, and unit labor costs
are likely to rise further.

I-3
Continued upward cost pressures, diminishing supplies of
some agricultural products, and strong demands--particularly from
consumers--are keeping prices moving up at a fast pace. At whole-
sale, a deceleration of the upward movement apparent during the winter
may now be occurring as some of the extraordinarily large increases
of that period slacken off or--as in the case of copper--reverse.
At the consumer level, however, average prices of goods and services
are probably continuing to rise at around the 4 per cent rate of the
winter months.
Demands for credit
Credit demands during the next month or two are not
expected to be exceptionally large, but probably strong enough
to extend the recent rise in long-term interest rates touched off
by the increases in the discount rate, in the prime rate, and in
the cost of CD funds. However, if a tax increase becomes more
likely, the associated shift in market attitudes could lead to some
declines in longer-term market rates as investors seek to nail
down existing high interest returns.
The volume of publicly offered corporate bond issues in
May is now expected to be the largest since January, about $900
million. New issue volume is likely to remain sizable, and possibly
advance further, in early summer if the tempo of economic activity
accelerates. But there have been no signs, as yet, of any anticipatory
surge in capital market borrowings; corporate needs for external
funds are not extremely pressing partly because of the strongly rising

I-4
flow of profits, while banks' increased access to CD funds as a
result of the rise in rate ceilings may keep just enough bank credit
availability to stave off any sharp shift in borrowing away from
banks to the bond market.
The expected expansion in business production for the
second quarter is likely to be a factor contributing to relatively
strong business loan demands at banks. However, net demands may not
be quite as strong as in the March-April tax period. Not only is
some repayment of tax period borrowing expected, but the rise in the
prime rate may again move some short-term business and finance
company borrowing into the commercial and finance company paper
markets.
The Federal Government's demands for cash and to refinance
maturing coupon issues will become more of a critical market
factor in the coming two months. There are almost $4 billion of
publicly-held maturing issues that will have to be refunded in mid-
May. In addition, it appears that the Treasury will have to borrow
at least $2 billion in cash between now and mid-year in one form or
another, beyond the continuing additions to weekly Treasury bill
offerings already announced. Much of this cash will probably be
raised in June. These financing demands are expected to increase
demands for bank credit, and also the level of interest rates as
banks and other financial institutions are expected to be relatively
reluctant suppliers of credit and buyers of Government securities.

I -5
Municipal bond volume in May is expected to be about $1
billion--a drop off from earlier months this year--primarily reflecting
thecoincidental absence of any of the usually large and frequent
borrowers in this market, such as New York and California govern-
mental units. The volume for May and subsequent months could be
lowered somewhat further by postponements and cutbacks if there
were significant advances in market yields, which, however, at the
moment remain below mid-March peaks. On the other hand, if the
corporate market turns out to be unreceptive to new issues, this
might lead to an acceleration in issues of industrial revenue bonds.
Supply of funds
While the possibility that credit demands could pick up
sharply cannot be discounted, the principal source of upward interest
rate pressures over the near-term is likely to be from the supply
side, as the higher discount rate and greater monetary restraint make
it more costly and in some cases--such as under existing ceiling
rates for time and savings accounts other than CD's--less possible
for institutions to attract funds for lending and investing. Commercial
banks are expected to restore some of the CD run-off that they experienced
over the March-April period, by bidding for funds at the higher
interest rates now possible. How active banks will be in that respect
will depend in part on the trend of loan demand and on the trend of
inflows (and outflows) in .consumer-type time and savings deposits under
prevailing ceilings.

I -6
Inflows of consumer-type deposits are likely to remain at a
considerably reduced level, given the higher structure of market
interest rates that is emerging. Savings deposits have declined at
large banks much more this year in April than last year, or in years
prior to 1966. Moreover, inflows of other consumer-type deposits
have slackened further recently. And while there may be some pickup
in May and June from the current trend, which was undoubtedly affected
by personal income tax payments, the extent of the improvement might
be minor as consumer expenditures remain relatively high and as their
saving is increasingly attracted by higher yields on market instru-
ments. While there will be continued shifting between U.S. Govern-
ment and private deposits, aggregate demand deposit growth is not
likely to provide much offset at banks to a slowing of consumer-type
time and savings deposits.
Prior to the increase in the discount rate last week, the
level of short-term market yields suggested that inflows to nonbank
financial institutions would probably moderate during April and in
the months ahead. Further constraint on such flows can now be
expected, even though the inability of commercial banks to escalate
their competition for consumer-type deposits will moderate the effect
on nonbank institutions of the rising level of market yields. Reduced
inflows--and the expectation of sizeable attrition at mid-year under
current rate ceilings--will likely produce cutbacks in new mortgage
commitment volume.

I -7
Balance of payments. With final data still lacking, the
annual rate of payments deficit in the first quarter before special
official transactions is now estimated at roughly $3-1/2 billion
on the liquidity basis and $2 billion on the official reserve trans-
actions basis. These figures are smaller than had been guessed a
month ago, and moderately smaller than those for the year 1967.
But they are disappointingly large in view of the new restraints on
outflows of U. S. capital that have been in effect since January 1.
No early further reduction in the deficit on either basis
is in prospect. Some improvement is expected in the trade surplus,
and hence in the balance on goods and services from the low first
quarter level. The stimulus to exports from continental Europe's
vigorous economic expansion--both directly and via third countries--
is likely to be only partly offset by a leveling off of demand from
Canada, Japan, and the United Kingdom. Part of the first quarter
bulge in imports was temporary; imports should rise less rapidly
than exports in the months ahead.
But this trade improvement seems likely to be roughly offset
by a renewed worsening on capital account. Capital transactions during
the first quarter included a number of unusually favorable developments:
a reflow of bank credit subject to the FCRP of about $480 million,
about the amount expected for the full year; and exceptional foreign
direct investment in the United States of $200 million; record net
foreign purchases of U. S. corporate stocks in January, which tapered
off in February; and inflows of liquid funds from commercial banks

I-8
abroad of nearly $600 million in January-February alone, a larger
flow than is likely to be sustainable.
Thus U. S. Government analysts do not now expect the deficit
for the full year to be below the first-quarter rate. The OECD
Secretariat, too, warns in a recent paper for Working Part No. 3
that the U. S. payments deficit may be large again this year.

THE ECONOMIC PICTURE IN DETAIL
The Nonfinancial Scene
Gross national product. The second quarter rise in the
gross national product will probably equal or exceed the large rise
in January-March, which is now estimated by the Department of
Commerce, at an annual rate of $20 billion in current dollars and
about 6 per cent in real terms. The GNP deflator, which accelerated
to 4 perccent last quarter, is expected to continue to rise at this
rate.
Several developments now suggest a stronger second quarter
than we had previously anticipated. Consumer and government defense
expenditures expanded faster than expected in the first quarter,
raising final sales by $25 billion, the largest quarterly increase
on record. At the same time, the rate of inventory accumulation,
after adjustment for inventory revaluation, was substantially less
than anticipated, and the level of stocks in relation to sales was
reduced.
Personal income is expected to continue to rise sharply,
and the consequent further strong rise in consumer sales should
stimulate a rebound in inventory accumulation. The increase in
defense spending in the second quarter is likely to equal--or perhaps
exceed--the $2.5 billion rise in the period just ended. With fixed
investment holding steady, the rise in aggregate demand in the

II -2
second quarter appears likely to be at least as large, both in
current dollars and in real terms, as in the first quarter. Even
if a tax increase is enacted, it seems unlikely that it would be
effective early enough to greatly modify the near-term outlook.
Similarly, the recent rise in the discount rate and
associated monetary restraint is not expected to slow most types
of expenditures for the GNP significantly this quarter, but
inventory-building may be hampered in some instances and housing
starts are likely to decline near the end of the period.
The $16 billion (or 13 per cent), annual rate of rise in
consumer expenditures in the first quarter exceeded that in the
record final quarter of 1965 even after allowing for the recent
faster rate of price increase. The $8 billion (or 14 per
cent) annual rate rise in nondurable goods expenditures was particu-
larly notable. This upswing, in a sector which is considerably
less volatile than durables, follows a year in which the total rise
was only 4.8 per cent. Apparel sales were particularly strong, but
food, gasoline, and department store sales generally also increased
substantially.
Among durable goods, domestic auto sales rose from an
annual rate of 7.4 million in the fourth quarter to 8.2 million
in the first, boosted by March marketings of 8.7 million. Imported
car volume rose even faster. Furniture and appliance sales showed
a quarterly increase of about 4 per cent (or 16 per cent annual rate)
after a year of very sluggish growth, and service outlays accelerated
somewhat.

II -3
The major factor in the sharp increase in consumption
in the first quarter was the record gain in personal income,
reflecting exceptionally large increases in February and March.
Expanding employment and rapidly rising wage and salary rates were
given an extra boost by the increase in the minimum wage in
February. In March, the rise in employee compensation was much
smaller, but increased social security pensions added over $3 billion
at an annual rate to income, bringing the total to a level 8 per
cent above a year ago.
Normally, the saving rate rises temporarily with a large
increase in income, but in the first quarter it declined by over a
half a per cent from the exceptionally high fourth quarter rate of
7.5 per cent. The greater availability of new model autos in the
first quarter probably occasioned some of the drop. Even so, the
saving rate is still very high when measured by the post-1959
average and, with the current expansion in consumer credit, it
could easily decline further.
An additional factor affecting spending in the first and
second quarters of this year is an increase over last year of $2
to $2-1/2 billion in refunds of personal income taxes, only about $1
billion of which was predicted by the Treasury in January. Converted
to an annual rate, this is a most substantial addition to purchasing
power.

II -4
The rise in disposable personal income this quarter will
probably fall a little short of the exceptional $13 billion first
quarter increase, but will out-distance that in any earlier quarter
since the outsize rise in the third quarter of 1965. Further expansion
in employment and wages will be augmented by higher social security
benefits initiated in March, but which will not have their full
effect until this quarter.
With these income gains, an estimated rise in consumer expendi-
tures at a rate of $12.5 billion appears on the low side, especially
since it represents little further increase over the March rate of
sales except for food and household durables, and implies little
change in the saving rate. The rapid rise in consumer prices--a
rate of about 3 per cent over the past year and about 4 per cent in
recent months--appeared for a time to be depressing consumption.
But consumers seem to be adjusting themselves to inflation and are
obviously less inclined to "hold-back" than last fall. Rising
unit sales of new domestic autos even after the 6 per cent year-
to-year rise in the transactions price in the first quarter do not
suggest much consumer resistance to high prices.
The reduction of inventories in relation to sales in the
first quarter has provided a basis for a rebound of inventory
accumulation in the second quarter. The inventory-sales ratio in
February declined to 1.52 from 1.55 last fall. Although this is
not a low figure historically, the stimulus for inventory-building
appears strong in the consumer area, particularly if spending for goods

increases as now expected. Stocking-up by wholesalers and retailers
is suggested by a sharp rise in their borrowing at banks recently.
Retail stocks of autos may also be built up somewhat further this
quarter, especially if sales tend to move even higher.
Defense outlays in both the first and second quarter are
growing at a faster rate than projected last month, and at a much
more rapid pace than indicated in the Budget. As a result of the
Tet offensive in the first quarter, and rising operations and
maintenance costs, expenditures are expected to rise at a rate of
$2.5 billion in each quarter, compared to the $0.5 billion quarterly
rise suggested in the January Budget.
Little change in business fixed investment in the second
quarter has been projected. Some decline in plant and equipment
expenditures was shown in the Commerce-SEC survey of investment
intentions, and machinery output has been dropping, but any deficiency
in industrial outlays is expected to be offset by an increase in
construction by educational, religious, and other institutional
investors. Autos sales to business (which are included in business
fixed investment in the GNP but not included in the "intentions"
surveys) are also expected to increase further. A recently released
McGraw-Hill survey, which was taken about one and a half months
later than the more comprehensive survey by the Commerce-SEC,
indicates a somewhat stronger year for fixed investment than the
latter, but the difference probably relates to the second half;
furthermore, McGraw-Hill estimates would not reflect fully the decline
in commercial construction likely to result from monetary restraint.

II -6
Commitments for residential construction have been slowing
somewhat since the end of last year and are likely to fall further
as a result of the recent tightening in monetary policy. A continued
drawing down of commitments may result in an appreciable drop in
starts in June, and bring the second quarter average down to an
estimated 1.38 million from 1.49 million last quarter. Residential
construction outlays are expected to level off at $28.3 billion in
the second quarter.
Net exports dropped to a rate of only $2.6 billion in the
first quarter, in which exports were affected more than imports by
a dockworkers' strike in New York. Both exports and imports are
now rising rapidly, and the surplus should improve significantly this
quarter.

Industrial production. The March rise in industrial production
of .6 of one point was due mainly to recovery in output of the auto-
motive industry (.4) and to increases in coal and steel (.2). By
and large, output in most industries was unchanged in March, with a
few small increases offset by a few declines. Industrial production
at 162.1 per cent was slightly above the record 162.0 reached last
December but only 1.4 per cent above the fourth quarter 1966 high.
The priod of little change in total industrial production
since December 1967 can be seen in the table, which also shows some
interesting differences among some major components.

There were roughly parallel changes shown by BLS manhours
and other data for the sector covered by the production index. The
table below compares quarterly average changes (to smooth out monthly
irregularities) in industrial production and comparable BLS production
worker manhours, and also, for reference, GNP total and goods only in
constant dollars. The manhour data show no change from the fourth
quarter of 1967 to the first quarter of 1968 and are still 2.8 per
cent below the fourth quarter 1966 high. In contrast, industrial
production in the first quarter of 1968 was 1.3 per cent above the
preceding quarter and total GNP in constant dollars was 1.5 per cent
above.

Production indicators for April are only fragmentary.
Output of raw steel is up, but auto assemblies are off from March
and from the scheduled April rate. If, however, auto output for
the rest of the month continues at the rate set in the week ending

II -11
April 19 (the highest since October 1966) this month's assemblies will
be little changed from March. Output of crude oil and coal are down
somewhat from the high March level, but gains following settlements of
the glass and copper strikes may more than offset these declines.
Capacity utilization Utilization of capacity by manufacturers
was estimated to be 84.0 per cent in March, down very slightly from
84.1 per cent in February. After falling sharply in early 1967,
the operating rate has remained almost unchanged since early last
summer.
Utilization rates continue to be high in the manufacture
of aircraft and electric power generating equipment. Only moderate
amounts of unused capacity are available for the production of most
textile products. Steel production is at record levels but over-all
capacity appears to be adequate.

Retail sales. Retail sales are continuing strong following
an accelerated tempo during the first quarter. The first quarter
as a whole was up 4.5 per cent from a relatively weak fourth quarter,
with the greatest strength in durables--particularly automobiles.

II -12
Nondurables goods sales increased 4 per cent, with strength in nearly
all major groupings.
Expansion appears to be continuing in April, although
civil disorders adversely affected sales early in the month in many
areas. Auto sales were off in early April from the advanced March
rate but general merchandise and apparel sales were strong just
before Easter.

Retail prices have been rising generally but considerably
faster for nondurable goods than for durable goods. From November
1967 to February 1968, average nondurable goods prices increased
4.8 per cent, with food and beverages for home use up 7.6 per cent,
apparel 4.8 per cent, and gasoline 5.2 per cent--all at seasonally
adjusted annual rates. In contrast, durable goods prices at retail in-
creased at a 2.8 per cent rate in the same period, despite a rise of
7.2 per cent in furniture and floor coverings.

II -13
The ebullience in retail sales was not foreshadowed by the
Census Consumer Buying Survey in January. There was a clue in the
February Michigan Survey which found consumer attitudes somewhat
improved from the preceding November but consumers were still far
less optimistic than in 1965.
Unit auto sales and stocks. Dealer deliveries of new
domestic autos in the first 10 days of April declined substantially
to an estimated seasonally adjusted annual rate of about 7.5 million
units owing in part to civil disorders. In March, the sales rate was
8.7 million units, up one-tenth from February and up one-sixth from a
year earlier. The March total was boosted by a sharp jump in the
final sales period as several major sales contests were ending.
Sales in the first quarter of 1968 were at an annual rate
of 8.2 million units compared to 7.4 million in the final quarter of
1967 and 7.2 million in the first quarter of 1967. Trade sources now
forecast auto sales for calendar year 1968 will be about 8.3 million
units (excluding some 850,000 imports), compared to 7.6 million in
1967. If this number is realized, auto sales in the remaining
three quarters would average only moderately above the first quarter
rate.
The stock of new cars increased 4 per cent in the first
period of April and on April 10 totaled 1.5 million units, slightly
more than a year earlier. Entering the second quarter, the days'
supply of new cars (based on the seasonally adjusted sales rate of
the first quarter) was about 50 days.

II -14
Sales of used cars in March were little changed from
February and a year earlier,, while stocks were up 5 per cent from
a year earlier.
Sales of imported cars in March were up almost 30 per
cent from a year earlier, and for the first quarter as a whole
were up 40 per cent.
Consumer credit. Not surprisingly, the surge in consumer
spending in the first quarter has been accompanied by sharp increases
in instalment credit. Credit financing is involved in two-thirds of
all new cars sold, and in half of all used cars. And for other con-
sumer goods--including household durables and apparel--the proportion
of credit sales runs to more than 30 per cent of the total.
The turnaround in the consumer credit situation first became
apparent last November, but the sharpest advances have been reserved
for early 1968. In February--the latest month for which complete
data are available--consumer instalment credit was expanding at an
annual rate of $6.8 billion, up $2 billion from January and the
highest rate since August 1966. March also looks strong, particularly
in autos, with the picture less clear for other types of credit. The
annual rate for the first quarter as a whole should be about double for
the $3.3 billion increase for all of 1967 but still less than the
record $8 billion expansion in 1965.

II -15
This step-up in credit expansion reflects both new borrow-
ings and a changing pattern of repayments on old debt. Demands for
consumer credit have been rising ever since last summer, but the
recent uptrend in credit extensions has been both sharper and more
persistent. Meanwhile, the slackening in repayments from last
summer's unusually fast pace has also contributed to growth in out-
standing consumer debt. It also seems clear that having reduced
their debt burden last year by maintaining a high level of repayments,
consumers have found it easier to take on new commitments during
the current buying surge.
The principal factor in the increased use of credit has
been the renewed strength in consumer spending. But credit
intensity has also increased, as indicated by the fact that the ratio
of amounts borrowed to amounts spent has risen both from last
summer and a year ago.

The pick-up in consumer borrowing has affected virtually
all major credit categories and lender groups. Among the latter,
banks and credit unions continue to increase their penetration of
the market. Among types of credit, autos have been the standout.
Extensions of auto credit in the first quarter (with March partly
estimated) were running at an annual rate of $30 billion, up more
than $2 billion from the fourth quarter and $3.5 billion from the
first quarter of 1967. The major area of weakness in consumer
borrowing continues to be home improvement loans and this may stem
in part from lender reluctance to become locked into longer-term
consumer loans at a time of uncertainty about the future course of
interest rates.
Lending standards in the consumer area show little sign
of increased restrictiveness. Average maturities on new car loans
granted by sales finance companies have, if anything, risen slightly
further in recent months. The typical 36-month contract now accounts
for about 82-83 per cent of all contracts, up a point from the
fourth quarter and about the same proportion as a year ago. The
only significant note of tightening has come in downpayment require-
ments for used car loans. Since last fall, the proportion of used
car contracts with dealer cost ratios over 110 per cent (loan as a
per cent of wholesale value) has declined from one-fourth of the
total to about one-fifth.

II -17
Orders for durable goods. New orders for durable goods rose
7-1/2 per cent in March as orders received by the aircraft industry
increased 82 per cent, steel orders declined 21 per cent, and other
durables on balance showed a moderate gain.
New orders for the producers' equipment category ("machinery
and equipment") increased 3 per cent, recovering almost half the sharp
decline in the preceding month, but they remained well below ship-
ments and unfilled orders declined for the fourth consecutive month--
for a total decline of 5 per cent over the period. The unfilled
orders-shipments ratio for machinery and equipment in March was about
3.7, down from 4.2 in early 1967.
The record rise in aircraft orders in March apparently
reflected mainly increased civilian business but defense orders also
rose and the new unfilled order levels for the industry reached
all-time highs. In dollar amounts, the March jumps in the air-
craft new order level and in its order backlog each totaled $2
billion--exceeding the March increases in new and unfilled orders for
all durable goods combined.
New orders received by steel mills were at the lowest level
since last September, and unfilled orders, which had increased
sharply from last August through February, declined moderately.
Incoming business may have slowed in part because of the extraordinary
surge in import buying, at prices well below domestic prices. However,
the steel mill order backlog at the end of March was, except for
February, the highest since April 1965.

Business inventories. The rate of inventory accumulation
declined sharply in the first two months of the year. In book value
terms, manufacturing and trade inventories increased only $225
million in February and $600 million in January. For the two months
combined this represented a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $5
billion, as compared with nearly $12 billion in the fourth quarter.
Price increases have been accounting for a progressively
larger portion of the rise in manufacturing and trade inventories
and the recent build-upof stocks in real terms has thus been substan-
tially smaller than that in terms of book value--in fact, after
allowance for price increases, inventories may have declined somewhat
in February.
The Commerce Department is currently estimating first
quarter nonfarm business inventory accumulation on a GNP basis
at an annual rate of $3 billion--down from $7.7 billion in the fourth
quarter. These estimates incorporate substantial adjustments
in the book value figure for inventory revaluation and they also
include allowances for changes in stocks outside manufacturing and
trade. In the first quarter estimate, a further build-up has been
assumed in these other areas, and a rise in manufacturing and
trade stocks for March has also been incorporated in the estimate.
The January-February increase in book values was roughly
equally divided between manufacturing and trade, as was the
increase in the final quarter of 1967. The relatively large
accumulation of stocks by retail and wholesale distributors, which

II -19
began last summer, stands in sharp contrast to the liquidation during
the first half of last year. Nevertheless, despite the January-
February increase, the ratio of distributors' inventories to sales
resumed its downward trend early this year when sales rose sharply,
and in February the ratio was about at the level of last September
and of two years ago.

products industries- in the first two months of this year, at a $700
million annual rate, was only slightly more than a third of the 1967
rate. Stocks of machinery and equipment producers declined in January
and February--at an annual rate of more than $1 billion in contrast
to an increase in last year at a rate of $800 million.
A smaller buildup in inventories this year than last by
producers of machinery and equipment would seem to be indicated
by recent developments in these industries. New and unfilled orders
for machinery and equipment in 1967 did not continue the strong
upward expansion of 1964 to 1966 and early this year they declined.
Recent investment anticipations surveys, after allowing for higher
prices, indicate only a relatively small further increase in
equipment spending this year. New and unfilled orders of defense
products producers seemed to have leveled out after rising fairly
sharply since early 1965, but in March, aircraft--particularly civilian--
orders rose sharply. This may act to slow further reduction in the rate
of inventory accumulation--or possibly lead to renewed pick-up--in
this sector.
1/ The defense products grouping includes the aircraft and other
industries whose major products are defense-type goods irrespective
of whether the goods actually are used for defense purposes. Orders
for new aircraft from both domestic and foreign airlines increased
substantially last year; thus recent changes in stocks in the aircraft
industry-- as well as in sales and orders--are not related exclusively
to defense business. Moreover, in March, a sharp rise in aircraft orders
was reportedly chiefly from commercial airlines.

In contrast, nondurable goods producers showed a large
spurt in inventories in January and, despite a slight decrease in
February, the rate of accumulation for the two months combined was
as large as in the fourth quarter. This rise for nondurable goods
accounted for about two-thirds of the overall January-February rise,
in sharp contrast to their relatively small contribution to the
rise throughout 1967.
In contrast to distributors, manufacturers' sales declined
in January and February and their stock-sales ratio rose. However, it
remained lower than any time last year except in December. The
January-February rise in inventories relative to sales was widespread
among the major industry groups and contrasts with widespread declines
in 1967. In addition, inventories of the major durable goods
manufacturing industries remained high, or increased, in the January-
February period relative to their unfilled orders.

II -22
Construction and real estate. New construction put in
place--already at successive new highs in January and February--
edged upward further in March to a seasonally adjusted annual rate
of $81.9 billion. Residential construction continued to play a
major role in the advance, rising in March for the fifteenth consecu-
tive month to virtually the high reached in November of 1963.
Private nonresidential construction, which in January had recovered
appreciably from last year's lows, continued to change little. Public
construction also held at an advanced rate, following some upward
revision in the series back through the fourth quarter of last year.
For construction activity as a whole, about half of the year-to-year
increase in March reflected higher costs as estimated by the Depart-
ment of Commerce.

Private housing starts, which were revised moderately
downward for February, declined in March to a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of 1.48 million units. This brought the average for the
first quarter as a whole to 1.49 million, the highest rate for any
quarter since late 1965 and in line with staff expectations. While
multi-family starts turned upward in March, all of the increase
in the first quarter average stemmed from single-family starts and
from the North Central states and the West.
A decline in starts is projected for April and the spring
quarter as a whole partly because of the relatively advanced rate
already reached and partly because of the slowing in commitments
which began to develop before the end of last year when uncertainties
about prospective net inflows of new funds to major lenders began to
reappear. However, a sharp downward shift is not likely in the
next few months. The further increase in the discount rate effective
April 19 came at a time when mortgage commitments were still compara-
tively high, liquidity built up during 1967 by both lending
institutions and the Federal Home Loan Banks was still relatively
intact, and builders' plans through the important spring months
and into summer, had been largely made. Moreover, seasonally
adjusted permits in March were holding at about the high February
rate and, while down in the North Central states and the South, were
rising further in the Northeast and the West.

Seasonally adjusted sales of new single-family houses by
speculative builders turned upward again in February and averaged
more than a fourth above a year earlier. With basic demand pressures
higher in spite of rising mortgage rates and other costs, seasonally
adjusted stocks of speculatively built homes available for sale
continued exceptionally low. While supply limitations have also
been a constraining factor in existing home sales, such activity also
continued at a substantially higher level in February and at prices
averaging about 4 per cent more than a year earlier, according to the
National Association of Real Estate Boards.~I

II -25
The recent open housing legislation signed by the President
on April 11 promises some further changes in the structure and level
of effective demands for all types of housing over the long run. How-
ever, the direct impact of the legislation on real estate markets will
be limited this year. This is because until January of next year,
the Act will apply specifically only to dwellings owed and/or operated
by the Federal Government and to dwellings financed with the help of
Government agencies and built since November 20, 1962, the date of
President Kennedy's original executive order affecting such housing.
Starting in 1969, however, coverage will extent to all apartment
buildings, however financed, and to new single-family homes constructed
by builders in the business of selling more than two houses a year.
At that time, discrimination--including price-discrimination--to
real estate borrowers solely because of race, religion or national
origin will also be expressly prohibited. After January 1, 1970,
coverage will be extended further to include all single-family,
owner-occupied homes sold through real estate brokers. When all
phases of the Act are in effect, it will cover as much as 70 to 80 per
cent of all sale and rental transactions.
Plant and equipment spending, (Confidential until released
Friday, April 26). According to advance information, the McGraw-Hill
survey of business plans for new plant and equipment expenditures this
year indicates an increase of 7.8 per cent from 1967. In 1967 plant
and equipment spending increased only 1.7 per cent. This survey, was
taken during March and early April and shows a slightly larger increase

II -26
than the 5.8 per cent rise indicated by the Commerce-SEC survey
taken in late January and February. Although the McGraw-Hill survey is
designed to yield results comparable to Commerce-SEC, the coverage tends
to be more limited to the larger companies and the coverage of the
commercial sector is considerably more limited. Thus, the small
difference between the McGraw-Hill and the Commerce-SEC survey may
not necessarily indicate a significant change in business plans.
Two aspects of the McGraw-Hill survey, however, suggest that
businesses may now plan larger increases in fixed capital spending
than were planned earlier in the year. The later date of the private
survey may have caught a real change as investment plans were more
nearly completed. Moreover, in durable goods manufacturing, an area
where the McGraw-Hill survey has been fairly close to actual invest-
ment in recent years, the increase indicated is 10 per cent--twice
as large as that shown by the Commerce-SEC January-February survey.
The McGraw-Hill survey shows larger increases or smaller declines than
the Commerce-SEC survey for each of the major durable goods industries,
except non-ferrous metals and motor vehicles.
The McGraw-Hill survey also found that manufacturers
increased capacity by 5 per cent in 1967, and they plan to increase
capacity 6 per cent further this year.

II -27
Labor market. The labor market continues to show consider-
able strength. Although employment in manufacturing was little
changed in March, the workweek held firm at relatively high levels,
and employment in most nonmanufacturing sectors continued to expand
vigorously. The over-all unemployment rate edged down one-tenth of a
point to 3.6 per cent, and for adult men (25 and over), the unemploy-
ment rate dipped to 1.8 per cent, matching the lowest rate achieved
during the Korean War.
Unemployment insurance claims were still declining in
mid-April (seasonally adjusted), and were close to the low levels of
early 1966. Strong employment gains are apparently continuing in
April, reflecting further expansion in nonmanufacturing and renewed
growth in manufacturing, in part because of the return from strike of
glass and copper workers. Hours of work, however, may decline because
of riots which affected activity in the survey week.
Nonfarm payroll employment rose by 140,000 in March,
compared with an average monthly rise of 240,000 since August 1967
(prior to the auto strike). Although there was no employment increase
in the industrial sector, construction held the very strong job gain
of the previous month. In trade and State and local government,
employment gains were particularly brisk in March.
For the first quarter as a whole, nonfarm payroll employment
was an impressive 800,000 higher than the fourth quarter level--an
annual rate of increase of 3.2 million; over the year nonfarm employ-
ment was up by 1.9 million. The sharper rate of growth in the first

II -28
quarter reflected an accelerated rate of job gains in government and
trade, augmented by a continued increase in construction and manufac-
turing employment.

Gains in manufacturing were widespread, with relatively
large increases in the defense-related, consumer goods, and metals
and machinery industries. Despite the resurgence in factory employ-
ment--which began in the third quarter of 1967--the first quarter
level was only slightly higher than a year earlier. But with output
expected to increase sharply in the second quarter, with retail sales
strong and defense spending up, the first quarter job growth in manu-
facturing will probably continue and nonfarm employment as a whole
should expand by an additional 600,000 in the current quarter.

II -29
Demand for labor over the past year has been met by a growth
in the civilian labor force that has been about in line with "normal"
trends. In the first quarter, the civilian labor force was 1.6
million larger than last year. Total employment increased by a like
amount and the unemployment rate edged down from 3.7 to 3.6 per cent.
Adult women continued to account for the bulk of the labor force
increase, or about 950,000, with adult men contributing the rest. The
extra workers needed to meet the expected large increase in employment
in the second quarter may be supplied by additional women entering the
labor market; there should also be a small further decline in unemploy-
ment to 3.5 per cent in the second quarter.
Earnings. Average hourly earnings of production workers in
manufacturing continued to rise in March to a level 6 per cent above a
year earlier, the largest rate of increase since 1957. In addition to
the substantial contract settlements which continue to raise wages, an
important factor has been the minimum wage increase on February 1st.
Over 7 million workers obtained wage increases, totaling $2.3 billion;
more than 3 million of these workers were in manufacturing.
In virtually every major industry, average hourly earnings
in March were more than 6 per cent higher than a year earlier.

Output per manhour and unit labor costs. Some recovery in
the year to year rate of growth of manufacturing productivity has been
evident in the past quarter, accompanying the rise in manufacturing
output. A six-tenths of a point rise in the manufacturing production
index in March--with manhours down slightly--raised productivity by
enough to offset the continued increase in compensation costs, and unit
labor costs leveled off for the month. For the first quarter as a
whole, output per manhour in manufacturing averaged 2.5 per cent above
the year-earlier level, a still modest rate, but the largest year-over-
year gain in over a year. Compensation per manhour increased 6.7 per
cent over the year. But, as a result of the larger productivity gain,
the over-the-year increase in unit labor costs was reduced to 4 per
cent, the smallest since 1966.

IV 1.3 5.9 4.6
1968 -I 2.5 6.7 4.0
Compensation per manhour in manufacturing is likely to con-
tinue to grow at an annual rate at least equal to the recent increases
of 6-1/2 -7 per cent, reflecting the tight labor market, sharply ris-
ing prices and continued substantial wage settlements. Thus, further
gains in productivity at the current rate would still leave unit labor
costs rising at an annual rate of close to 4 per cent.

II -31
Wholesale prices. The rise in prices of both industrial
and agricultural commodities slowed between mid-February and mid-March
and the BLS wholesale price index increased only 0.2 per cent further, to
108.2 per cent of the 1957-59 average. (Confidential until release April 26.)
Slowing of the rise for agricultural commodities (to only
0.1 per cent) reflected in large part decreases for pork, poultry,
and vegetable oils following sharp increases over the preceding three
months. Prices of milk and dairy products declined seasonally.
Prices of liverstock--both cattle and hogs--continued up, and prospects
are favorable for continued strength in livestock prices, with supplies
diminishing--in part seasonally--and consumer demands strong. More-
over, prices of milk and dairy products are probably now rising again;
a 7 per cent increase in the support price for manufacturing milk
became effective April 1. And short supplies of fresh fruits and
vegetables, which led to a sharp price run-up last winter, are likely
to extend through the spring. Average prices of foods and foodstuffs
in mid-March were about 1-1/2 per cent above the 1967 average and
further advances will undoubtedly average much less than the extra-
ordinarily rapid rate of increase from last November through February.
The industrial commodity average increased 0.3 per cent in
March, as had been estimated a month ago, after speeding up to 0.4
and 0.5 per cent, respectively, in January and February. Features
of the March showing were:
1) A decline in the number of product classes showing
increases, to about the late 1967 monthly average (when the BLS

II -32
industrial average was also increasing at a 0.3 per cent rate per
month.)
2) Sharp decreases in prices of container board and
liquefied petroleum gas, which caused appreciable declines in the
paper and fuels major groups. The former decline apparently reflected
replacement of list prices with actual market prices now available--
a telescoped adjustment that might well have been made much earlier
or over a period of months. Container board prices reportedly are
now firming. The decline in liquefied petroleum gas is attributed
to an over-hanging surplus at a time of seasonal price softening at
the end of the heating season. Both these large price declines thus
appear to be one-shot affairs. Mainly because of these price decreases,
the special FR groupong of "other" (sluggish) industrial materials
showed no change in March, despite a further upcreep in prices of
steel mill products and various other metallic and nonmetallic materials--
particularly for construction.
3) A slowing of the rise in the price average for consumer
nonfoods, which had stepped up in January and February. Prices of
apparel and major appliances and most other household goods continued
to rise in March, but textile housefurnishings and television prices
reportedly declined somewhat and prices of autos and small electirc
appliances were unchanged.
4) Persistence, for the second month, of a much slower rise
in average prices of producers' equipment than that prevailing from
last September through January, presumably in response to the moderate
demand situation.

II -33
5) Sharp further increases in copper, lumber and plywood,
which brought the FR sensitive industrial materials index to the
highest level since April 1956. Since mid-March, however, average
prices of copper scrap and of refined and semi-fabricated copper
have been declining, with renewed availability of domestic copper at
prices well above pre-strike levels but well below prices of copper
available (from imports or scrap) towards the end of the 8-1/2
month strike. Lumber prices (nearly 15 per cent above a year earlier
in March) are likely to level off or recede with seasonal improvement
in supplies and stabilizing of home building demands.
Reversal of the earlier run-up in copper prices and tapering
off or reversal of the lumber price increase could be important
moderating influences on the rise in industrial prices. The combined
weighted increases in basic copper and lumber and plywood prices
equalled two-thirds of the rise in the total industrial commodity
average in March. Over the 5-month period from last October to March--
when upward price pressures were generally strong and pervasive--
the FR industrial commodity average excluding basic copper and lumber
and plywood increased at an annual rate of about 3 per cent, compared
with 4.3 per cent for the grand total (shown in the table below).

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL SITUATION
Bank credit. Following the 4 per cent annual rate of
expansion in March, commercial bank credit, as measured on a daily
average basis by the credit proxy, is projected to decline somewhat
in April. Data thus far available, prior to the raising of the
discount rate and Regulation Q ceilings, indicate that the proxy may
decline at a 1.5 per cent annual rate for the month as a whole, the
largest decrease since November 1966.
Although expected to decline late in April, total loans and
investments at large banks, after declining throughout most of March
as banks liquidated almost $2 billion of Government security holdings,
began to expand rapidly late in the month and into early April. As
indicated by the chart on the following page showing seasonally adjusted
weekly reporting bank data, this recent growth reflects primarily
expansion of bank loans, particularly those to businesses.
Apart from a temporary increase in bill holdings by New York
banks at the end of March, presumably for "window dressing" purposes,
weekly reporting banks continued to liquidate Government securities in
early April. Bank acquisitions of other securities also seem to have
declined somewhat on a seasonally adjusted basis in late March and
early April. In particular, the increase in municipal holdings at
New York banks during the first three weeks in April was considerably
below acquisitions both in the same period for previous years and in
the first three weeks of March. With continuation of the run-off of

CD's after the March tax and dividend period, banks probably found it
necessary to sell Governments and to curtail acquisitions of the
securities to meet increased loan demands that began around mid-March.
After showing only a moderate increase since year end, as
inventory accumulation remained relatively light, business loans
expanded rapidly after mid-March. The recent acceleration in business
loan growth was fairly widely distributed among industries and about
equally divided between banks in New York City and outside. The
industries that showed the largest increase in business loans were
primary metals, textiles, mining, retail and wholesale trade, and
services. Borrowing by the primary metals group remained strong as
iron and steel producers presumably continued to finance both fixed
capital outlays and inventory accumulation. The large increase in
bank borrowing in the mining category reflects primarily financing by
a major copper company for the acquisition of another firm. The
recent increase in bank borrowing also may have reflected some shift
of financing to banks from commercial paper in view of the rise in
the effective cost of commercial paper financing above the former
prime rate. That incentive, however, was eliminated with the rise in
the prime rate to 6-1/2 per cent last week, although commercial paper
rates also moved up 1/8 of a percentage point following the prime rate
increase.
Part of the recent business loan growth reflects the
strength in term loans (business loans with maturities greater than
one year), which continued to expand more than seasonally, rising

III -4
approximately $550 million in March. Although declining somewhat
from the end of February, the ratio of term to total business loans at
the end of March remained high--45.4 per cent as compared with 43.7
per cent a year earlier. Almost half of the March increase in term
loans occurred in durable goods manufacturing, including primary
metals which increased almost 115 per cent over the level outstanding
in March, 1967.
Data for New York City banks suggests that while direct
corporate borrowing from banks for tax payments was substantial, it
was somewhat less than last year, even though corporate income tax
payments in April were marginally higher than in 1967. The lower
level of bank borrowing probably reflects the larger amount of tax
bills turned in for taxes and increased resort to CD and finance paper
run-offs as sources of financing.
Real estate loans at all commercial banks continued to
expand in March at about the same relatively rapid rate that has pre-
vailed since autumn. Expansion in consumer loans maintained the
higher rate of growth that developed in February. Although security
loans declined throughout most of March, they rose sharply in the
second week of April when dealer positions rose substantially. Data
for New York City banks, however, suggest that they receded again the
following week.
Bank deposits. With short-term market rates continuing to
rise and offering rates of CD's pushed to the Regulation Q ceilings on
all maturities prior to the increase in these ceilings on April 19,

III -5
time and savings deposits at banks declined considerably following
interest crediting at the end of March. While these interest rate
relationships account for most of the recent decline in time and
savings deposits, the reduced rate of consumer saving in the first
quarter probably also contributed to the slower rate of growth in
these deposits since the end of the year. For all commercial banks,
total time and savings deposits, on a daily average basis, are pro-
jected (made prior to the increase in Regulation Q ceilings) to expand
at only a 1.5 per cent annual rate in April.

More than half of the decline in time and savings deposits
at large banks during the first two weeks in April was due to a run-off
in CD's. As has been the case since the first of the year, and in past
periods of CD run-offs, most of the attrition occurred at the major
money market banks in financial centers, particularly in New York.
Following the recent increases in Regulation Q ceilings, preliminary
reports indicate that some banks are already paying the maximum 6 per
cent rate on 90-day maturity CD's, but no data are yet available as to
the inflows responding to these higher rates.
Outflows of consumer-type time deposits also contributed
substantially to the decline in total time and savings deposits at
large banks during this period. In particular, regular savings
deposits, in contrast to the strength they have been showing in recent
months, almost matched the decline in CD's in early April. While the
magnitude of the decline in savings deposits is more than twice that
of 1965 and 1967, it does not approach the outflow in 1966. On the
other hand, preliminary estimates indicate that savings deposits at
country banks will continue to expand in April at about the same
average rate as over the first quarter.
Following the gold crisis week in mid-March, banks liabil-
ities to foreign branches fluctuated widely, rising sharply in late
March and declining during the first two weeks in April. By the week
ending April 17, however, these liabilities had risen back to approx-
imately their average level in March.

III -7
The money stock in April, on a daily average basis, is
currently projected to expand more rapidly than the 4.5 per cent
annual rate for the first quarter. This estimated higher rate of
growth reflects largely the recent expansion in business loans, the
continued decline in U.S. Government deposits and a more than normal
increase in currency.
The currency component of the money stock in April is now
projected to continue increasing at the more than 11 per cent annual
rate that prevailed in March, about twice the average rate of growth
during 1967. Although probably associated in some degree with the
recent spurt in retail sales, the increase in currency outstanding
also is reported to reflect some withdrawals for hoarding. In addi-
tion, some special circumstances, such as an armored car strike in
California in March and early April which caused some businesses to
hold extra cash, and larger than normal cash demands by the military
also contributed to the increase in currency outstanding.
Nonbank depositary institutions. In line with the improved
inflows to savings and loan associations and mutual savings banks in
February and March, withdrawals from both institutions during the
entire March-April reinvestment period were less than the attractive-
ness of other financial assets might have suggested. On the other
hand, the resurgence in net inflows typical of later stages of a
reinvestment period did not develop this year.

NOTE: Reinvestment period for S&L's includes the last three business
days of March and the first ten calendar days of April. The
data for the New York City mutuals covers the last three busi-
ness days of March and the first five business days of April.
The level of outflows at savings and loans during the April
portion of the reinvestment period was dominated by the experience of
the California associations, which accounted for three-fourths of the
$265 million total net attrition of share capital in this period and
for more than one-half of total S&L outflows during the reinvestment
period as a whole. Industry surveys indicate that--as in 1966--most
of the outflows from California S&L's reflected withdrawals by the
presumably more market-sensitive out-of-state depositors. There may
also have been further savings capital depletions after the reinvest-
ment period ended by withdrawals of in-state depositors to cover
California state income tax payments which had increased sharply this
year.

III -9
The general weakness of savings flows toward the end of the
reinvestment period probably reflected the increased attractiveness of
other financial assets which had developed since March. These included
the improved outlook for stock prices associated with the President's
late-March announcements, rising short-term market yields, and, to a
minor degree, payments made to purchase attractively-priced PC's.
The attractiveness of other financial assets in April
contrasted with conditions in February and March, when stock market
volume was more moderate and the volume of new issues and market yields
were declining. These factors probably contributed to the improved
February-March inflows at nonbank intermediaries.

Mortgage market developments. Reflecting mixed savings
experience over the March-April reinvestment period, S&L's and savings
banks were apparently continuing to restrain their new residential
mortgage commitment activity through mid-April. As in other recent
months, hesitancy of the thrift institutions as well as other lenders
to commit on mortgages reportedly stemmed mainly from uncertainties
about future cash inflows, already advanced levels of outstanding
commitments, the possibility of further advances in mortgage rates,
and unusually attractive bond yields. (All of these factors will, of
course, tend to be reinforced by the midmonth increase in the discount
rate.) Lenders were also restrained by expectations that Congress
might soon remove the restrictive rate ceilings on FHA and VA mortgages,
and the FNMA would soon implement its plan to auction secondary market
purchase commitments. The latter action, which was formally announced
April 18 to begin May 6, will result in more competitive yields on
Government underwritten mortgages throughout the secondary market, and
will thus work toward enhancing flows of funds into such loans within
the primary market relative to conventional home mortgages or other
types of investments.
Contract interest rates on new-home mortgages, which had
shown signs of leveling off in February and early March, edged up
during the remainder of March to reach new postwar highs in both the
primary and secondary market, according to the FHA series. For report-
ing mortgage lenders, meanwhile, aggregate outstanding residential
mortgage commitments increased further in March on a seasonally adjusted

III -11
basis, with S&L commitments reaching a record high. Taking all three
lender groups together, the backlog of residential mortgage commitments
finally reattained its end-of-1965 level, as the table shows. For the
thrift institutions during recent months, however, there are indications
that takedowns of old mortgage commitments have tended to slacken, and
that new mortgage commitments have probably been running at least
moderately below the peak rates reached last fall.

The relatively minor over-all change in home mortgage
yields during March, as in other recent months, reflected partly the
seasonally low supply of new mortgages plus apparently greater borrower
recourse to loan assumptions, all-cash transactions, and installment
land contracts in lieu of new borrowing at record contract rates or at
discounts which averaged as much as 7 points on certain FHA mortgages.
The cumulative extent of these pressures is suggested by reports from

III -12
a number of areas that some existing houses have been selling at
premiums if they carry large outstanding loans which buyers can
readily assume.
The slight upturn in home mortgage rates during March was
associated with a pick-up in offerings of Government underwritten
loans to FNMA for purchase under its secondary market operations.
This increase plus heavy FNMA acquisitions of FHA and VA mortgages
during the first quarter as a whole led FNMA to announce a long over-
due cut of 1-1/2 points in its purchase prices, effective March 30,
thus raising the yield to FNMA on such loans by about 18 basis points.
It marked the third time during the past seven months that FNMA has
reduced its purchase prices in an effort to bring them closer in 1ine
with the general advance in home mortgage yields.
Although returns on home mortgages tended higher in March,
yields on new issues of high-grade corporate bonds rose sharply over
the period. Thus the already narrow gross-yield spread of home mort-
gages over such bonds shrank back virtually to a postwar low, as the
table shows. Allowing for servicing costs which are a good deal
higher on mortgages than on bonds, implied net yield spreads were
probably negative on the average, as during the fourth quarter of last
year. This development has led several mortgage companies to pare
their regular servicing fees somewhat in an effort to augment the net
yield on home loans delivered to permanent investors.

Some of the uncertainties and structural problems in the
home mortgage market have indirectly bolstered apartment-house lending
which has sustained the advanced level of multi-family starts in recent
quarters. The restrictive usury ceilings in 15 States, which set
limits of 6 or 7 per cent on returns on mortgage loans made to indi-
viduals, are usually inapplicable to loans extended to those apartment-
house developers that are incorporated. Even more important, going
yields on multi-family loans are much more competitive with returns on

III -14
alternative types of long-term instruments. Some multi-family
mortgages, in addition, now carry an added attraction for the lender
of an equity-type participation in rental income.
Corporate and municipal bond markets. Yields on recently
offered corporate and municipal bonds advanced about 10 to 15 basis
points in the three trading days after the April 18 announcement of
an increase in the discount rate; at the close of business on April 23,
yields on new issues in the corporate market were approximately at
their March peaks. This increase in yields is not reflected in the
data for the week ended April 19 shown in the yield table. But the
market had already exhibited a tendency toward higher yields in the
week prior to the discount action, largely due to reappraisals of the
Vietnam peace situation. Most recently, an Aaa-rated $100 million
Bell Telephone of Pennsylvania issue was offered to yield 6.75 per
cent, 20 basis points above a directly comparable issue 3 weeks
earlier. This higher yield did not illicit a particularly enthusi-
astic response from investors.

Even before the discount rate action, the prospective
volume of publicly-offered corporate bonds was already dampening
investor enthusiasm for new issues at the then current yield levels.
Although it does not appear likely that a surge of industrial financ-
ing will occur over the near-term, the addition of several large issues
to the April and May calendars has reversed the decline in public
volume evident since December. In April, publicly-offered corporate
bonds are estimated to aggregate $825 million, slightly above March
but about the same as the first quarter monthly average rate. (As

III -16
with March, a sizable Canadian corporate offering to U.S. investors
accounts for part of the estimated April volume.) Total bond and
stock offerings, however, will probably aggregate $1.7 billion, about
$0.3 billion below the seasonally higher March as well as the corre-
sponding month a year earlier.
Flotations of public bond issues scheduled for May amount
to nearly $700 million and may ultimately rise to about $900 million.
This would place the May volume as the heaviest since January. As now
constituted, the calendar contains an unusually large number of public
utility issues as well as a $150 million convertible bond offering to
stockholders by Chase Manhattan Bank. While the growth of private
placements was somewhat less than estimated during the first two
months this year, a further expansion in takedowns of private place-
ments is indicated and this will likely help to push total corporate
security financing in May to nearly $1.9 billion.

State and local government bond volume continues to remain
relatively large, although below the unusually rapid 1967 pace. The
volume of issues in April is expected to aggregate $1.1 billion, $250
million below March. Even before the move towards further monetary
restraint, however, new issues had been accorded an unenthusiastic
response by investors, and dealer inventories advanced. Underwriters
report that commercial banks in particular have shown very limited and
selective interest in new municipal issues. In light of the current
level of yields, further upward rate pressures might result in a signif-
icant number of postponed issues. Thus, the final volume of offerings
in May might fall below the $1 billion estimate--which, while large by
historical standards, would by itself be the smallest total this year.

Stock market. During the first half of April, stock prices
rose rapidly on record trading volume. By April 18, when the discount
rate was raised, prices had approximately returned to their peak levels
of mid-January, while during the first two and a half weeks of April
average trading volume was about two-thirds greater than in February
or March. Indeed New York Stock Exchange volume was about one-fourth
greater than the previous record month of January.

The increase in the discount rate led to a sharp immediate
drop in stock prices and a further, though lesser, retreat on the
subsequent Monday. On April 23, however, prices turned up in enthusi-
astic trading. Market participants reportedly consider the signal of
further future monetary restraint to be outweighed by several favorable
factors. More and more corporations are displaying excellent first
quarter earnings, and the market was also influenced by reports that hopes

III -19
for a tax increase are somewhat brighter, and that possibilities of
Vietnam peace negotiations still exist.

The abrupt upturn in the stock market during the first half
of April was universally attributed to the sudden change in the
Administration's position on peace negotiations. Each small move in
the direction toward negotiations was greeted by soaring trading volume
and large price advances. An industry-by-industry analysis, however,
shows that although the stocks of virtually all groups have advanced,
investors expect the greatest economic gains resulting from an end to
Far Eastern hostilities to be experienced in housing and industries
formerly expected to suffer from stringent measures to correct the
imbalance in international payments.
Nonetheless, during the first half of April, last year's
most favored stocks--which had been depreciating even during March--
also recovered significantly, and the American Exchange Index, reflect-
ing the prices of less-seasoned stocks, rose quite rapidly. Most
glamour stocks, however, have not re-attained their 1967-68 highs.

III -20
Preliminary estimates for March show margin debt advancing
sharply by $80 million to $6,230 million in the face of modest stock
market activity. However, technical difficulties with the series,
already evident in February, were doubtless accentuated in March, and
thus, it seems at this point imprudent to attach any real significance
to the advance./ Free credit balances remained unchanged as did the
status of most accounts. Securities loans by large banks to non-
brokers declined sharply in March, by $50 million, but this decline
may simply reflect the loss to brokerages of margin customers inter-
ested in convertible bonds. With the revisions in Regulations T and U
regarding these bonds--in effect since March 11--brokers presumably
have a heretofore non-existent comparative advantage in the financing
of customer purchases of convertibles; they can now offer the same
credit terms while also providing greater convenience. That the number
of margin accounts at brokerages rose sharply by 15,000 offers some
confirmation of this hypothesis.
1/ The February data--after several revisions, showing debt unchanged
at $6,150 million--may well have been distorted by the lengthening
of the settlement period from four to five days, and the extreme
variation in trading volume during January, February, and March.
In addition, in March margin debt reported by the panel may well
in some cases include--despite requests to the contrary--debt
associated with convertible bonds as well as stock. Furthermore,
the change-over in accounting procedures at all firms, required
by the new separation of accounts rule, has in general required
re-programming by the automated panel firms and, although it is
hoped that this data-processing job has been effected successfully,
some errors may have occurred.

U.S. Government securities market. Yields on U.S. Government
securities moved markedly higher in the wake of the Board's actions on
the discount rate and the Regulation Q ceiling for large time CD's.
Advances in bill yields ranged to 25 basis points, while yields on most
longer maturity coupon issues moved up about 10 to 20 basis points. In
both sectors of the market these increases came on top of advances
which had already developed during the first half of the month. At
present levels, bill yields are the highest they have been since
November 1966, and the 3-month bill yield is only 10 basis points below
its peak in September 1966. Yields on longer-term Treasury issues,
however, are still about 20 basis points below the peak levels touched
briefly in mid-March of this year.

The steady upward drift in yields on longer-term Treasury
issues prior to the discount rate change generally reflected an
increasingly cautious view of the prospects for peace in Vietnam and
an eroding optimism about the chances for effective near-term fiscal
action. The increase in bill yields in the first half of April may be
attributed to some of the same factors as well as to the approach of
the April tax period. In addition, the cumulative impact of greater
monetary restraint on money market rates caused dealer borrowing costs
to increase sharply and made dealers more reluctant holders of both
bills and coupon issues. With financing costs to dealers high in the
market, the System made repurchase agreements during the period at
5-1/8 per cent, 1/8 of a percentage point higher than the discount
rate then prevailing.
Upward pressure on short-term yields was augmented when the
Treasury announced weekly additions to the 6-month bill auction,
beginning with the auction on the April 15 tax date. Upward pressures
on bill rates peaked on that date, and then showed a tendency to
decline in the period just prior to the discount rate action. In part
this movement represented seasonal demands from public funds and
anticipation of the reinvestment of proceeds from maturing tax antici-
pation bills--only about 40 per cent of which were turned in for
taxes. During this period dealers made net sales of nearly $1 billion
of bills (a sizable portion of which was to the System) thus sharply
reducing their trading positions. With demands for bills continuing
relatively large in recent days, the new three-month bill was auctioned

III -23
at 5.54 per cent on April 22, the first auction following the discount
rate increase, and then declined to 5.49 per cent in the immediate
after market.
Other short-term rates have also moved up in response to
the change in the discount rate and the corresponding increase in
Treasury bill rates, as shown in the accompanying table.

Federal finance. With Federal tax collections in April not
yet complete, forecasts of Treasury cash requirements over the
remainder of the fiscal year still contain a sizable margin for
error. Recognizing this limitation, the staff is currently pro-
jecting the following pattern of tax collections:
FEDERAL TAX RECEIPTS
(In millions of dollars, not seasonally adjusted)
1968
March a/ April(e) May(e) June(e)
Corporate income taxes 4,6 4.6 .9 8.4/
Individual income taxes:

Total budget receipts 11.9 18.0 12.1 20.3
(New concept)
a/ Based on actual collections.
1/ Includes $500 million for expected legislation providing for
corporate tax acceleration.
These projections allow for levels of corporate profits and
personal incomes higher than in the model underlying the January
Budget Document. However, total Treasury receipts are shown only
marginally larger than in the Budget, because personal refunds on
1967 tax liabilities are estimated to total $1.5 billion more than
projected in the Budget. The graduated withholding tax tends to
provide large refunds to many taxpayers.

III -26
If the pattern of receipts shown in the table is realized,
total receipts for the fiscal year would amount to $153.9 billion.
This would be only about $300 million more than estimated in the
January Budget (after deducting $2,2 billion from the Budget total
that was assumed to be raised in fiscal 1968 by the income tax
surcharge and by earlier passage of the corporate income tax
acceleration than is now possible). With Federal outlays for fiscal
1968 now projected at $177.5 billion, or $1.9 billion more than in
the January Budget, the estimated deficit for the fiscal year amounts
to $23.6 billion. This would be nearly $4 billion larger than shown
in the Budget.
These numbers imply further gross Treasury cash borrowing
of at least $4 billion over the remainder of the fiscal year--even
if the Treasury does not try to accumulate an end-of-June balance
much in excess of $5 billion. Of the $4 billion of remaining needs,
$1.4 billion is being provided by already announced additions to
weekly and monthly bill auctions and another $400 million, by sales
of Export-Import Bank discount notes. For the residual $2 to $2.5
billion for which no plans have yet been announced, the Treasury
has several options. In the May refinancing it could elect to
offer new issues for cash and raise a little new money through a
moderate overallotment of these issues. Even if this were done,
however, a sizable amount of additional cash would have to be raised
in June through a regular Treasury offering, a participation certificate
offering, or a combination of the two. Depending on the timing of the
borrowing, it is also possible that the Treasury may have to borrow
directly from the Federal Reserve to cover the seasonal low in its
balance prior to the receipt of mid-June taxes.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
U.S. balance of payments. Preliminary data, including
incomplete information for March, would indicate a liquidity deficit
in the first quarter of between $600 and $800 million, seasonally
adjusted. (A firmer figure may be provided in the Friday Supplement).
Sizeable deficits continued to be reported in April, thru the 17th.
Before special transactions which favorably affected the liquidity
deficit by about $200 million, the deficit range in the first quarter
would be from $800 million to $1 billion, somewhat less than the
quarterly average during 1967.
Special transactions in the first quarter included a purchase
of a $125 million medium-term bond by Germany (in April a fourth and
final bond purchase was made in accordance with last year's agreement),
a purchase of $60 million of U.S. Government Agency securities by Israel,
and transfers of $40 million by Mexico and Venezuela into long-term
deposits. A purchase of a $300 million nonconvertible Treasury note
by Canada in March was largely offset by redemptions earlier in the
quarter. (Additional information on these special transactions is
provided in Appendix A). An unusual item not included in the special
transactions was a private capital inflow of $200 million resulting
from a rights issue by the Shell Oil Company which was subscribed to
by the foreign parent company.
On the official reserve transactions basis, the first-
quarter deficit is roughly estimated at between $400 and $600 million

IV -2
seasonally adjusted. Unadjusted, the deficit was near zero; the large
decline of $1.4 billion in the U.S. gold stock was matched by a $400
million rise in holdings of foreign currencies and a large decline in
U.S. liabilities to foreign official agencies.
Gold. Since the establishment of the two-market system for
gold on March 17, the price of gold on the "free market" has ranged
between $37 and $40 an ounce, except for a price of $44 in Paris on
March 18. The present price (April 24) is $38.30. The volume of
foreign official gold purchases from the U.S. Treasury has, however,
increased considerably since March 17. Except for a single large sale
to one Western Europena country, this buying has come from about
fifteen small countries purchasing relatively small amounts of gold.
In January and February, total central bank purchases from the United
States (excluding our sales to the Gold Pool) were $45 and $55 million,
respectively. In March such purchases jumped to $365 million, of which
$290 million was sold after March 17. Sales in April thru the 19th
amounted to $110 million; several of the buyers were probably at the
same time converting sterling to dollars with which to make the gold
purchases.
Current and capital transactions. The preliminary and
partial information available on various components of U.S. inter-
national transactions in the first three months of the year indicates
a worsening of the balance on goods and services and an improvement
in capital transactions. The trade surplus, discussed below, declined
further from the very low fourth-quarter rate, and the overall balance

IV -3
for all goods and services probably fell further. In the first quarter,
income receipts from U.S. direct investments abroad -- unusually high
in the last half of 1967 as a result of abnormal profits of oil company
branches abroad and of special dividends -- may have dropped off, while
income payments on foreign investments in the U.S. probably rose.
Military expenditures abroad and payments for foreign travel are also
believed to have expanded from the fourth-quarter rates.
In the capital account, net foreign purchases of U.S. corporate
stocks in January-February, not seasonally adjusted, were about equal to
the rate in the fourth quarter, which was unusually large.
Bank claims on foreigners reported under the foreign credit
restraint program were reduced in the first quarter; the net reflow was
nearly $500 million, greater than the target set for the whole of 1968
under the new balance of payments program. There is some evidence,
however, that recent outflows of credit from agencies or branches of
foreign banks in the United States, not specifically covered by the
restraint program, may offset some of the aforementioned gains made
by U.S. banks.
While total U.S. liquid liabilities to foreigners decreased
in the first quarter, liabilities of U.S. banks to their foreign
branches increased substantially. From the first Wednesday in
January to the first Wednesday in April, these increased by about
$650 million. Since mid-March, however, the net change has not been large.
During the three weeks following the Gold Pool communique of March 17,
interest rates on Euro-dollar deposits moved down from a range of

IV -4
7 to 7-3/8 per cent, on maturities of from one month to a year, to a
range of about 5-7/8 to 6-5/8 per cent on April 4. Subsequently there
were increases, especially on April 19 following the Federal Reserve
discount rate increase to 5-1/2 per cent. As of April 24 Euro-dollar
rates range from 6 per cent on one-month deposits to 6-15/16 per cent
on one-year deposits.
U.S. foreign trade. The first-quarter trade surplus is
estimated at less than $0.5 billion annual rate (balance of payments
basis), even lower than in the fourth quarter. The eleven-day
longshoremen's strike in New York at the end of March adversely
affected the trade surplus.
Imports in the first quarter were $31.3 billion at an annual
rate, about 9 per cent higher than in the fourth quarter. The ratio
of imports to GNP was 3.79 per cent, a new high, exceeding the previous
peak of 3.71 in the first half of 1951 during the Korean War, and up
sharply from 3.44 per cent in the calendar 1967. Despite the port
strike, imports in March were no lower than in the preceding two
months. No details are yet available on the March imports.
Imports of steel and copper continued to advance in January-
February. The rate of increase in steel imports was not large, but
with the earlier than usual spring reopening of the Great Lakes heavier
shipments are now anticipated. The adverse effect of the copper strike
on the trade balance in the first quarter was probably close to $1
billion at an annual rate.

IV -5
Imports of other industrial materials -- textiles, building
materials, and metals other than copper and steel -- also increased
sharply. Arrivals of fuels, principally petroleum, which had rebounded
strongly in the fourth quarter from the low rate of last summer resulting
from the Arab-Israeli War, increased further in the first part of this
year.
A sharp spurt in automotive imports, particularly from Canada
but also from Europe and Japan, was a major element in the rise of
imports, at least in January-February. The customary export balance
in automobile trade with Canada shifted to an import balance of about
$100 million (at an annual rate) in the first two months of this year.
Heavy arrivals of cars from non-Canadian sources in January-
February reflected not only continuing strong sales of such cars but
also a substantial increase in inventories. While sales were below
those of the fourth-quarter (not seasonally adjusted), they were
about 20 per cent higher than in the first quarter of 1967. About
60 per cent of car imports (excluding cars from Canada) in the first
two months of the year went into stocks, compared with about 25 per
cent in the corresponding periods of the previous two years.
Purchases of foreign capital equipment (excluding automotive
equipment) also increased strongly to a record rate in the early
months of the year. The ratio of such imports to equivalent total
domestic expenditures increased sharply this year after showing
little change throughout 1967.

IV -6
Imports of nonfood consumer goods (excluding autos) advanced
at an even greater rate than the exceptionally rapid rise in total
domestic expenditures on such goods. Based on imports in January-February,
the import-domestic expenditures ratio in the first quarter was about
6.9 per cent, a full percentage point higher than in the fourth quarter,
and exceeded the previous peak ratio in the first quarter of 1966. The
entire gain in imports was in nondurable goods, mainly clothing and
footwear. Arrivals of durable goods (other than cars) in the first two
months were below fourth-quarter rates.
Exports in the first quarter are estimated at an annual rate
of $31.7 billion (balance of payments basis), about 6 per cent higher
than in the fourth quarter. March exports, affected by the port strike,
were off 12 per cent from January-February.
Shipments of both agricultural and nonagricultural commodities
in January-February were above fourth-quarter rates. The increase in
exports of agricultural products reflected, to a large extent, an
acceleration of shipments of grains to India and Morocco under the
P.L. 480 program. Deliveries of commercial aircraft increased sharply,
and together with a rise in shipments of motor vehicles to Canada
accounted for over one-third of the total advance in nonagricultural
exports in January-February.
The advance in exports was widely distributed by areas. The
greatest gains were in shipments to Canada, Asian countries other than
Japan, and Latin America. Shipments to Japan recovered after a fourth-
quarter dip. Exports to Western Europe, however, including the U.K.,
were only slightly higher than in the fourth quarter.

IV -7
Business conditions abroad. Economic activity in Western
Europe has advanced unusually rapidly since last autumn, stimulated
by strengthening investment demand in Germany, heavy consumer spending
in Britain, and substantial demand for European exports coming both
from within Europe and from other countries including the United
States. While British policies are now strongly oriented towards
damping domestic demand pressures, policies in other European coun-
tries remain stimulative on the whole, although only cautiously so
in some cases.
Outside Europe, the pace of economic advance shows signs
of slowing in Canada and Japan in response to fiscal and monetary
policies of increasing restraint. Demand in world trade on the
part of non-OECD countries, however, has been increasing after a
period of weakness in the second half of 1967.
Real GNP in Germany is estimated by the Bundesbank to
have increased by an extraordinary 4 per cent (16 per cent, annual
rate) from the third quarter of 1967 to the fourth quarter. Data
for the early months of 1968 on industrial production, new orders,
and unemployment suggest a further vigorous, though less spectacular,
advance since the fourth quarter. It is now generally expected that
real GNP will increase by 5-1/2 per cent in 1968 over 1967, whereas
the Government's medium-term plan published in mid-1967 had envisaged
an increase of only 4 per cent.

The sharp recovery of activity in Germany since last summer
has reflected an abrupt shift in inventory investment from liquidation
to accumulation, and also an upturn in spending for plant and equipment
which became marked in the fourth quarter, partly reflecting the filling
of orders placed by October 31 to take advantage of special depreciation
allowances expiring at that date. Exports have also risen, though less
rapidly than imports, which were running 13 per cent higher in January-
February than in the second quarter of 1967.

IV -9
Wage and salary incomes, and hence consumer spending, have
risen only slowly in Germany. Profits, on the other hand, have risen
sharply, reflecting an unusually large 6.5 per cent gain in output per
man-hour from the second half of 1966 to the second half of 1967; for
the industrial sector alone, the gain was 9 per cent. The rapid rise
in real GNP during the second half of 1967 was accompanied by a slight
further decline in the general price level, the first time such a com-
bination had been experienced since 1953.
The buoyant German recovery, together with strong demand
from other parts of the world, has helped to stimulate an economic
advance in other continental European countries. Industrial produc-
tion in January-February for all EEC countries combined was up about
6 per cent from its second-quarter-1967 level; for Germany alone, the
advance was about 7 per cent.
In France, the resumption of growth since last September
after an earlier period of stagnation has resulted mainly from in-
creasing export demand. Industrial production increased about 6 per
cent from the second quarter of 1967 to January-February 1968. Con-
sumer spending has been rising only slowly in recent months. Auto-
mobile sales in late 1967 and early 1968 were still below year-
earlier levels.
The Government appears to have committed itself to a refla-
tionary policy, despite some recent weakness in the balance of payments

IV -10
position. In January, it adopted a series of measures to stimulate
consumption, including a substantial income tax cut effective in
February. In March, instalment buying terms were eased for auto-
mobiles and trucks, and new government credits were made available
to the agricultural sector. A substantial budget deficit of more
than $1 billion equivalent is foreseen for 1968. Business sentiment
as recorded in monthly surveys has become increasingly optimistic,
and stock market prices have been rising this year after several
years of decline.
In spite of the renewed expansion, registered unemployment
in France continued to rise through March, reaching more than 1 per
cent of the labor force, which is thought to mean that nearly 2-1/2
per cent are actually unemployed, the highest rate since the early
1950's. The recent increase is partly statistical, reflecting a
liberalization of unemployment benefits, but partly genuine, attributable
to reduced labor requirements resulting from rationalization and heavy
capital investment in French industry in recent years.
In Italy, the cyclical pattern has been different from that
in other Common Market countries. Italian output grew rapidly in 1966
and early 1967 when its partner countries were having recessions.
Since mid-1967, Italian output has grown somewhat more slowly than
before. The slowdown may have reflected a reduction in the rate of
inventory accumulation. Also Italian fiscal policy became considerably

IV -11
less expansive in the fourth quarter than before, but this appears
to have been a temporary phenomenon -- the result of administrative
delays in spending money rather than of deliberate attempts to re-
strain aggregate demand.
The expansion of Italian exports resumed in the fourth
quarter after declines in the two previous quarters. Expansion in
plant and equipment spending and in residential construction appears
to have continued. Fixed investment outlays in real terms, including
housing, were 10 per cent larger in 1967 than in 1966. Total real
GNP was up 6 per cent, thanks partly to excellent harvests.
Among other continental European countries, the most buoyant
conditions have been experienced in the Netherlands; the Government
there has already begun to reverse the expansionary policies followed
last year, slowing spending and raising taxes. In Belgium, on the
other hand, the upturn -- largely export-induced -- has so far been
less than desired, and the Government has taken some steps in recent
months to stimulate the economy further. In March, the central bank
lowered the discount rate from 4 to 3.75 per cent. Business condi-
tions in Sweden are also subdued, with unemployment unusually high.
The Government is apparently relying upon economic revival elsewhere --
especially in Germany -- to stimulate recovery; while the central bank
discount rate was cut from 6 to 5-1/2 in February, it remains 1/2 point
above the level from which it was raised last December to combat
speculation.

IV -12
In the United Kingdom, consumer spending began to increase
last summer, stimulated primarily by wage increases, following the
ending of the period of "severe restraint" and by an easing of instal-
ment credit controls. Average weekly earnings increased by more than
5 per cent from June 1967 through January 1968, compared with less
than 2 per cent in the preceding seven months. Retail sales at con-
stant prices (which exclude autos and account for about one-half of
total consumer expenditures) increased by 1-1/2 per cent in the third
quarter and by about 2 per cent in the fourth quarter. Sales of auto-
mobiles increased much more sharply.
Through measures taken at the time of the devaluation of
November 18 and in the budget of March 19, the Government has sought
to damp the consumer spending boom and shift the sources of expansion
to exports and investment. Through the first quarter, the shift had
not yet been accomplished. Retail trade at constant prices leveled
off but consumer purchases of autos and other durables continued to
advance in anticipation of new taxes and other restraints and price
increases. Exports recovered in the first quarter from the earlier
dip occasioned by strikes, but the volume of exports in October-
February was running below the third quarter rate. Private plant
and equipment outlays in manufacturing are estimated to have declined
2 per cent further in real terms in the fourth quarter, and probably
have not increased since then.

IV -13
During the remainder of the year, consumer spending is
expected to decline in real terms, as a result mainly of new taxes
and price increases, but also of an incomes policy. It is hoped
that -- if major labor disturbances can be avoided -- exports and
private business investment will expand from now on by amounts suffi-
cient to keep real GNP rising at a 3 to 4 per cent rate despite the
cutback in consumption. Recent surveys of business expectations
indicate optimistic export prospects and suggest that a revival in
capital spending may now be getting under way.
In Canada, activity advanced briskly late in 1967 but has
since leveled off again. Industrial production was reduced in January
and February by a strike at General Motors, but would apparently not
have increased even without the strike. The unemployment rate has
remained around 4-1/2 per cent, well above the low of 3.3 per cent
reached early in 1966.
The main expansionary force in the Canadian economy in
recent months has come from exports to the United States. These
were up 17 per cent from a year earlier in the fourth quarter of 1967
and 23 per cent in January-February. A large proportion of the increase
represented once-for-all adjustment of the automotive industry to the
U.S.-Canadian agreement of 1965; as this adjustment is completed,
further growth of Canadian exports to the United States will depend
increasingly upon the course of U.S. demand. Some further portion
of the export increase has been the temporary result of the U.S.
copper strike, now ended.

IV -14
Business plant and equipment expenditures in Canada,
according to a recent survey, are expected to decline 1-1/2 per cent
in dollar terms (and substantially more in real terms) from 1967 to
1968.
Prices and costs have been rising in lagged reaction to the
demand pressures experienced in 1965 and 1966. During 1967, average
hourly earnings in Canadian manufacturing increased by 8.3 per cent
and the cost of living rose by 4.0 per cent; the comparable figures
for 1966 were 6.0 and 3.6 per cent. Hence the Government has felt
it necessary to emphasize the containment of inflation, rather than
economic growth. The budget for fiscal 1969, incorporating an in-
come tax surcharge, is expected to reduce Government financing re-
quirements to about $750 million, half those of the preceding year.
Canadian monetary policy remains restrictive.
Japan, too, is placing increasing policy emphasis upon
restraint. Also, although consumer demand remains strong, business-
men are adopting a more cautious attitude, partly in view of the
proposed Vietnam peace talks. Through February, industrial produc-
tion had risen more slowly in recent months than before, and new
orders for machinery had fallen off since last November's peak.
Cutbacks in capital spending plans have been made in some industries.
Inventories increased through February, and the number of medium-
sized firms going bankrupt reached a new high in March.
