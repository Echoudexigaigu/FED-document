I- 1
SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK
Outlook for economic activity
The excessive pace of economic expansion appears to be
continuing in the second quarter. The increase in the gross national
product is likely to total close to $24 billion, exceeding that of
last quarter by an appreciable margin. The rate of growth in real
output is now estimated at 7 per cent annually, above the 6 per cent
attained last quarter. This heightened rate of output indicates
additional pressure on already tight manpower, and further rapid
increases in wage rates and prices.
A number of factors appear to be combining to generate this
substantial growth in over-all output: defense expenditures are
likely to continue upward at the accelerated rate of the first quarter,
investment in inventories is likely to be rising, and net exports are
expected to recover substantially from their weak first quarter per-
formance. Residential construction expenditures are also increasing
faster than expected, reflecting housing starts at an estimated annual
rate of about 1.5 million for the quarter.
On the other hand, expansion in personal consumption expen-
ditures will probably be smaller than the exceptional advance in the
first quarter. The increase will still be substantial, however, in
comparison to those in the preceding year and a half. A dip in retail
sales in early April appeared to be attributable mainly to civil dis-
turbances, and was followed by renewed strength in auto buying and

I-2
increased demand for other consumer goods in late April and early May.
Disposable income is rising more rapidly than in the first quarter,
reflecting expanding employment, rising wages, large Federal tax
refunds, and full reflection of the increase in social security bene-
fits. The rise in income should outpace the projected increase in
consumer spending, resulting in an increase in the saving rate to
about 7 per cent from the 6.6 per cent in the January-March period.
Outlook for prices and resource use
The rise in the industrial price average--which has slowed
this spring--is likely to step up again this summer. The recent slow-
ing has been associated in large part with the post-strike downward
adjustment in copper prices. The total number of industrial commodi-
ties with reported price increases--including materials and both
consumer and producer products--remains large, indicating sustained
and widespread upward cost and demand pressures.
Prices of foods and foodstuffs at wholesale have been
marking time since February, following a sharp run-up last winter.
Resumption of a moderate rate of advance is expected, in large part
because of continuing strong demands pressing on moderately lower
supplies of livestock and products. Rising food prices, further
upward cost pressures in the trade and service sectors, and the lagged
effects of earlier wholesale price increases are likely to keep the
CPI moving up at a fast pace in the near future.

I- 3
Upward pressure on wages and unit labor costs will continue
throughout this quarter. High first-year wage increases (in the tele-
phone industry, the settlement was about 9 per cent) are likely to
spread to the aluminum, shipbuilding and apparel industries, and sub-
stantial wage and fringe packages (7 to 10 per cent annually) have
already been negotiated or are imminent for a major portion of the
construction industry.
Employment growth, barring prolonged strikes in aluminum
and shipbuilding and any significant expansion of current strike
activity in the construction industry, should be large enough to keep
the labor market tight and the unemployment rate at the April level of
3.5 per cent. The projected rise in industrial output, in pace with
real GNP growth, should increase slightly the rate of manufacturing
capacity use.
Demands for credit
The recent sharp rise of interest rates, and accompanying
state of near disarray in some long-term markets, reflect the contin-
uation of dilatory behavior on fiscal legislation, as well as the
cumulative effects from the tightening of monetary policy since last
fall. Unless expectations of an even firmer monetary policy, or fears
of a drying up in bank funds, are moderated, still higher interest
rates remain a distinct possibility.
The calendar of new corporate bond issues appears to be
holding near its advanced May size, while municipal bond offerings

I -4
seem to be building up somewhat further. But some postponements have
already occurred, and it is possible that additional issues--either
now on the calendar or in the planning stage--may also be postponed
as a result of the very high level of interest rates and congestion
in marketing that recently developed in capital markets. On the other
hand, tendencies for borrowers, especially corporations, to shift
borrowing to banks and away from capital markets may be discouraged
by the further tightening of lending standards that is reported to be
in process at banks.
The present lull in business loan growth at banks is likely
to be followed by a surge in June, in connection with tax payments,
even though banks' attitudes toward lending are becoming more restric-
tive. While corporations did improve their liquidity positions
earlier this year, uncertainties as to future availabilities of credit
may influence businesses to rely fairly heavily on currently available
bank funds, rather than on sales of liquid assets in meeting June tax
payments. Demands for bank loans in the weeks ahead may also be
influenced by more rapid inventory accumulation.
The Federal Government will not need to raise much new cash
over the next few weeks, but its cash needs will become sizable very
early in the new fiscal year. Assuming only payment for the $500
million Export-Import Bank PC after mid-June, the Treasury's cash
balance is likely to necessitate very large cash borrowing to cover
the July-August deficit, perhaps as high as $9 billion (and about
$1.5 billion less if--mirabile dictu--a tax bill is passed before

I- 5
midyear). The market is likely to begin to anticipate such large
needs as June progresses--for instance, dealers are likely to want to
continue reducing their positions--with consequent further upward
pressures on interest rates. The Treasury may also find it desirable
to anticipate its July-August needs by raising, or announcing, some
new cash in one form or another before the current fiscal year ends.
Supply of funds
Given the current level of market interest rates and exist-
ing Regulation Q ceilings, there appears to be little likelihood that
time and savings deposits over the next couple of months or so will
show any more strength than during the past two months, when they have
grown at only about a 2 per cent annual rate. In fact, time and
savings deposits could well be even weaker since banks will probably
not be able to avoid a fairly sizable attrition in outstanding CD's in
June. And banks will find it quite difficult, and probably impossible,
to regain lost CD funds in early summer, when securities, including
Treasury bills, issued to meet Treasury cash financing requirements
begin to compete more actively with CD's and tend to drive short-term
market rates further upwards.
Consumer-type time deposits--both savings and other time--
probably may rise slowly over the next few weeks. In July, however,
another substantial outflow of funds from consumer time and savings
deposits at large commercial banks seems likely. This outflow prob-
ably will be considerably larger than that in April, not only because

I-6
the general level of market rates will be considerably higher but
also because interest crediting at midyear is more widespread than at
the end of March.
Demand deposits are not expected to provide a substantial
offset to the reduced time deposit inflows. With deposit sources of
funds constrained, further growth in Euro-dollar borrowings appears
likely, although any substantial further demands in that market may
push interest rates on Euro-dollars up rather sharply.
The current level of market yields and projected volume of
Treasury financing likewise suggest continued reduced inflows at the
nonbank depositary institutions. Looking further ahead to the late
June-early July reinvestment period--when all institutions credit
interest--outflows of funds from those institutions can be expected to
be very large unless there is a tax increase.
Given this reduced access to funds by institutions, and
with outstanding mortgage commitments already high, new mortgage com-
mitments are expected to continue to slow further while mortgage yields
continue to rise. Recent advances in mortgage yields have matched the
most recent increase in bond yields, and the diversified lenders con-
tinue to have no incentive to shift funds to the mortgage market--
despite recent regulatory revisions in FHA and VA ceilings.
Other markets, too, will probably continue to feel the
effects of the tightening of supply conditions, at least for a while
further. The extent to which there will be additional adjustments in
mortgage and other debt markets will depend in part on the experience
of institutions and the market generally during the June tax and mid-
year interest-crediting periods.

I- 7
International developments
Release of the preliminary balance of payments results for
the first quarter of 1968 had little effect on exchange markets, since
the main magnitudes--notably the poor showing on merchandise trade and
the liquidity deficit at an annual rate of $2-1/2 billion--had been
known earlier. Preliminary indicators for April indicate a somewhat
higher rate of deficit in that month, with some renewed outflow of U.S.
bank credit. No early improvement in the over-all liquidity balance
is in sight. In April and May substantial inflows of foreign liquid
funds through branches of U.S. banks have continued.
Gold and foreign exchange markets have become increasingly
tense in recent weeks, with sterling very weak, gold at new highs, and
the German mark, Dutch guilder, and Swiss franc approaching their ceil-
ings against the dollar. The root sources of tension include a spread-
ing realization that the U.S. payments deficit is likely to be substantial
again this year, disappointment that the U.K. foreign trade figures
have not yet shown much improvement, continuing substantial payments
surpluses for Germany and some other European countries, and increased
discussion of possible exchange rate changes. Uncertainties have been
intensified recently by further postponement of fiscal action in the
United States, and by political difficulties in Britain and in France.
Events that could calm the markets might include sales of
South African gold in the free market, action by the U.S. Congress to
raise taxes, and some sign of improvement in the U.S. and U.K. trade

I-8
figures. But these events may not happen soon. In particular, while
the U.K. trade balance may well improve in the months ahead as the
effects of the November devaluation and the March budget make themselves
increasingly felt, near-term pressures on sterling resulting from shifts
of both private and official funds seem likely to remain severe.

THE ECONOMIC PICTURE IN DETAIL
The Nonfinancial Scene
Gross national product. The upward swing in total economic
activity remains exceptionally strong. The gain in the gross national
product this quarter is expected to amount to $24 billion--about $4
billion more than the very large first quarter increase. Real GNP
should rise at an annual rate of over 7 per cent, up from the already
advanced 6 per cent rate of last quarter.
These rapid rates of expansion follow a year in which a
first quarter pause was followed by successively higher quarterly
growth rates. Thus, economic momentum has been rising for a year and
a half. Unemployment has fallen to minimal levels, while price and
wage increases have become larger. This quarter, the GNP deflator is
expected to rise at an annual rate of 4 per cent as compared with 3.7
per cent in the first quarter.
Although the increase in gross national product is antici-
pated to be appreciably larger this quarter, the rise in final sales
will be smaller--about $21 billion as compared with an extraordinary
$26 billion in the first quarter. A smaller gain in consumer expendi-
tures accounts for much of the slowing in the rise of final sales.
However, a projected increase in inventory accumulation in contrast
to the sharp decline in the first quarter more than compensates for
this.

II -2
Consumer spending is expected to increase by $12.4 billion
this quarter. This is well below the $17 billion in the first quarter,
but it is still almost twice the quarterly rate of expansion in 1967.
Although retail sales dipped by nearly 2 per cent in April, for the
first month-to-month drop since last fall, the easing was at least
partly a result of civil disorders. Moreover, the April decline
followed several months of remarkably sharp increases in sales. Late
April and early May sales appear to have rebounded to or above the
advanced March rate. For the quarter, an 8.5 million rate of domestic
new auto sales is projected. Although this is a very high level of
sales, the increase is only about half that in the first quarter and
thus accounts for much of the slower increase in consumption expendi-
tures. Nondurable goods outlays also appear to be rising more moder-
ately than in the first quarter.
Disposable income of consumers is expected to increase
somewhat faster this quarter than last. The saving rate, which dropped
almost a full percentage point to 6.6 per cent last quarter, should
rise to about 7 per cent, partly because of the smaller increase in
auto sales and partly because the exceptional first quarter advance
in nondurable goods sales is unlikely to be repeated. Even if a tax
increase should be enacted early next month, it is unlikely to have
an appreciable effect on consumer income or demand for the quarter as
a whole.
The modest level of nonfarm inventory accumulation last
quarter, which has been revised down to an annual rate of less than

II -3
$2 billion, reflected in part the sharp acceleration in consumer
spending. Accumulation in defense industries also slowed, and stocks
held by machinery and equipment producers declined for the first time
since 1961. Since last October, in manufacturing and trade combined,
the inventory-sales ratio for durable goods has fallen from 2.11 to
1.96, and that for nondurables from 1.15 to 1.13--lower than for any
March in recent years. The retail stocks-sales ratio, excluding autos,
declined from 1.36 in December--a figure which was about average for
last year--to 1.30.
In this situation, and in the face of continued prospects
for further rapid advances in prices and wages, businessmen are
expected to expand output at a faster rate this quarter. Auto-makers
intend to produce at a rate which should add further to dealers'
stocks, possibly as a steel-strike hedge, and steel inventory accumu-
lation likely will continue. Under these circumstances, our projected
$5.0 billion rate of accumulation for this quarter appears conservative,
but the continued rapid increase anticipated for final demand seems
likely to prevent a sharper rise.
The near-term housing outlook is somewhat stronger than
foreseen last month. The April rate of private starts reached a
surprising 1.6 million units. Although a sharp drop is expected by
June, for technical reasons as well, because of tight credit markets,
the second quarter average likely will approach an annual rate of
1.5 million units, only slightly below the upward revised rate of the
first quarter. Outlays for housing construction are estimated to rise
by about $1 billion.

II -4
Business investment in new plant and equipment is also
expected to continue to rise this quarter in line with expectations
of an 8 per cent increase in outlays this year as reported by business
in the McGraw-Hill survey last month and consistent with the strength
in new orders for machinery and equipment in recent months.
A further rise of about $2.5 billion in defense spending
is anticipated this quarter. The acceleration in outlays in the first
half of this year in part appears to reflect greater activity in
Vietnam and a rise in armed service strength, and in part a catch-up
from the last half of 1967, when deliveries of defense goods were held
down. Although the trend of military prime contracts has been down
since November, the backlog of orders for aerospace and other defense
products indicates that deliveries could continue rising for some
time.
The Federal deficit, NIA basis, is expected to continue
very high this quarter, probably at an annual rate close to $10 billion.
However, if the surtax is not passed the deficit will be almost $3.5
billion higher, since our receipts estimates include an allowance for
the surtax for corporations (which are treated on a liability basis in
the NIA accounts). Under any circumstances, however, a sharp rise in
profits will add significantly to the rise in revenues. This quarter,
profits are expected to attain a rate of $96 billion, $7.5 billion
above the first quarter and $11 billion above the final period of 1967.
Social security and individual income taxes are also climbing. However,
refunds to individuals have been far above last year (and above expecta-
tions), particularly in the first quarter.

Industrial production. Industrial production was revised
upward in February and March and the first quarter level is now 161.9
(up .3 of one point from the earlier figure), as compared with 159.5
in the fourth quarter--an annual rate of increase of 6 per cent, the
same as real GNP.
In April, industrial production was unchanged from the March
level of 162.7 as increased production of materials was offset by
declines in output of final products. Production of autos, television
sets, and some appliances was reduced and output of tobacco products
was curtailed by a work stoppage. Production of commercial and freight
and passenger equipment also declined. Among materials, output of iron
and steel and some other durable and nondurable materials rose further,
reflecting in part accumulation of steel inventories by consuming
industries and the return to work following settlements in the copper
and glass industries.
Although industrial production was at a new high in March
and April, that high is only 2 per cent above the December 1966 level,
as shown in the table. Output has increased significantly since 1966
only in defense equipment, nondurable materials, consumer staples, and
commercial equipment. With the additions to productive capacity since
that time, output in many industries could be increased significantly
if the demand and manpower were there.

In May, industrial production is likely to rise above the
March-April level. Auto production schedules are set at an annual rate
of 9.0 million units, about 7 per cent above the reduced April level,
and through May 17 output has exceeded the scheduled rate. Output of
raw steel increased somewhat in early May and a further recovery in
production is anticipated in the copper industry. Also, insofar as
the April decline in average weekly hours in manufacturing was attrib-
utable in part to civil disorders and the Friday-Saturday holidays

seasonal factors, any rise in hours will have a smaller effect on the
production index than on production worker manhours.
Capacity utilization. The April rate of manufacturing
capacity utilization was estimated to be 83.9 per cent, down from an
upward revised 84.3 per cent the previous month. The April decline
was the third in the last four months as seasonally adjusted manufac-
turing output again failed to rise significantly above its December
level.
Steel output increased sharply in April and operating rates
are far above normal. Pressures on steel capacity do not appear to be
as great as in the 1965 inventory build-up, however, and some margin
apparently remains for increased output of most steel products.
The aircraft industry continues to operate at near capacity
levels and only moderate amounts of unused capacity are available for
the production of textile, petroleum and rubber products. Operating
rates are relatively low in other manufacturing industries.

Retail sales. Retail sales in April, seasonally adjusted,
declined 1.7 per cent from March for the first month-to-month decline
since October. However, early May data suggest a substantial rebound
from the slackened April pace.
Civil disorders in April undoubtedly affected sales; some
retail outlets were closed and spending was reduced generally. More-
over, the April decline came after several months of very large
increases, with a particularly sharp rise of 2.7 per cent in March.
The April drop was concentrated mainly in durable goods (off 3.5 per
cent), with the automotive group showing the largest decline. The
nondurables category was off less than 1 per cent, although the apparel
group was down nearly 6 per cent.

Unit auto sales and stocks. Dealer deliveries of new
domestic autos in the first period of May were unchanged from a year
earlier, when sales were unusually high. Sales for the month of May
are likely to be at an annual rate in the vicinity of 8.5 million
units, as compared with 7.9 million in April.
Production has continued to run above sales, and stocks of
new cars increased 5 per cent further in early May. On May 10 stocks
totaled 1.6 million units, one-tenth above a year ago.
Sales of used cars in April were down somewhat from March
but about the same as a year earlier. Stocks changed little from the
previous month but were 6 per cent above a year ago.
Sales of new imported cars in April continued to account for
over one-tenth of the total new car market and were one-third higher
than a year earlier.
Consumer credit. The pace of the instalment credit expan-
sion has picked up sharply this year. The annual rate of increase
reached $6.2 billion in the first quarter, up from $4.4 billion in
the fourth quarter and almost double the rate in 1967 as a whole.
Rising credit demands associated with the pickup in consumer spending
have been largely responsible for the rebound, although a slower rate
of repayments on old debt--as compared with much of 1967--has also
been a factor.

Most areas of consumer credit shared in the first-quarter
pickup, but increases in auto credit were particularly important.
However, the first quarter surge in auto credit merely served to
return that category to its normal position vis a vis total instalment
credit, i.e., about 40 per cent of the total. The extent of this
recovery may be judged by last year's data which show auto credit
outstanding accounting for only 10 per cent of the rise in total
instalment credit.
The instalment credit expansion probably slowed a little in
April. Reports for that month are only fragmentary, but the drop in
new car sales from the advanced March level apparently had a negative
effect. A turnaround appears under way in May, however, in view of the
higher rate of auto sales indicated by the first 10-day report.
Even with demands for instalment credit picking up, there
is still little evidence of a tightening in supply conditions in
response to the shift in monetary policy. In 1966, the impact of
tighter monetary policy on the consumer credit markets was quite

II -13
clear. As lenders saw their own funds become more limited and more
costly, they adopted more restrictive policies. In the case of new
car loans, for example, the typical maximum maturity remained at 36
months, but fewer customers were able to obtain those terms. Consumer
finance charges also rose and by spring 1966 interest rates on auto
loans were up a quarter- or half-point in many areas. Other consumer
rates also went up, although in some cases they were already bumping
against ceilings imposed by usury laws.
This year consumer lending standards have grown somewhat
more restrictive, but in general the response of credit grantors to
monetary policy changes has been both slower and less marked than two
years ago. Consumer interest rates, for example, have reacted even
more sluggishly than in 1966, with advances confined largely to new
car loans. And non-price auto terms are still relatively liberal.
At major sales finance companies, the proportion of new-car contracts
with 36-month maturities has remained near the 82 per cent level pre-
vailing during most of 1967. Perhaps the only significant note of
tightening in auto terms has been in down payment requirements for
used-car loans.
Nevertheless, as time goes on, lending standards will
almost surely become more stringent. As lenders see the differential
between cost and return on funds narrowing, they can be expected to
screen their loans more carefully and take other precautions to mini-
mize bad loans and losses.

II -14
Manufacturers' orders and shipments. Advance figures on
new orders received by durable goods manufacturers in April were 2.7
per cent below March and 4 per cent below the record high last December.
The decline from March to April reflected a substantial drop in new
orders for aircraft and more moderate declines in orders for nonferrous
metals, fabricated metals, and for transportation equipment other than
motor vehicles and aircraft.
New bookings for aircraft--mainly commercial--had increased
by 60 per cent in March, lifting new orders for all durable goods by
5.2 per cent. In April new orders for durable goods excluding aircraft
were 1 per cent above March but about unchanged from the average of the
first two months of the year. New orders for machinery and equipment
rose 4.6 per cent further, returning to about the December-January
level. April new orders for iron and steel were up 10 per cent from
the sharply reduced March level but were still 7 per cent below the
average in the three preceding months.
Unfilled orders rose in April only in the aerospace, motor
vehicle, and iron and steel industries. The order backlog was either
unchanged or down slightly in the other major industry groupings. The
rise in the aerospace backlog occurred despite the large drop in new
orders; shipments were also off sharply from the record March level
and were below the level of new orders. Shipments by all major indus-
tries except primary metals were off from the near-record March rate.

II -15
Business inventories. The book value of inventories held
by manufacturing and trade concerns increased about $200 million in
March, according to preliminary figures. This increase was appreciably
smaller than the rise in either January and February; and for the
entire first quarter the rate of increase in book values was at an
annual rate of approximately $4 billion, down sharply from the fourth
quarter rate of $11.8 billion. Moreover, price increases accelerated
further and accounted for virtually the entire book value increase
during the first quarter. The inventory valuation adjustment nearly
doubled in the first quarter and inventory accumulation on a GNP basis
(after IVA) in all nonfarm industries--i.e., including construction
and other lines as well as manufacturing and trade--was at an annual
rate of only $1.8 billion, down from $7.7 billion in the fourth quarter.
The sharp fall-off in the rate of inventory increase in the
first quarter was concentrated in durable manufacturing industries,
where first quarter accumulation was only a fourth as large as in late
1967, and at wholesalers, where sizable accumulation in the fourth
quarter was succeeded by some liquidation in the first. Accumulation
by retailers also declined considerably, despite further large accumu-
lation by auto dealers. Stocks of nondurable goods manufactures showed
a much larger increase in the first than in the fourth quarter.

A marked slowing of the rise in book value of inventories
in "defense products" industries (from a $2.3 billion rate in the
fourth quarter to $0.8 billion in the first) and a shift from a $0.7
billion rate of accumulation to liquidation at a $1.0 billion rate in
machinery and equipment industries featured developments in durable
goods manufacturing industries.
A large step-up in business sales--chiefly at retail stores--
accompanied the step-down in the rate of inventory accumulation, in
March and for the first quarter as a whole. As a result, the over-all
business inventory-sales ratio declined to 1.50 in March from 1.52 in
December and an average of 1.55 in the fourth quarter. The March ratio
was the lowest since September 1966. The March inventory-sales ratio
for manufacturers, where sales increased only moderately, was below the
ratios observed in 1967, but it was still above the low levels prevail-
ing from 1964 until the last quarter of 1966. The ratio of retail
inventories to sales was at an historically low level.

Construction and real estate. New construction put in
place in April continued little changed from the peak rate reached in
February. Residential construction (which is probably understated in
the present Census projection) held at the advanced rate reached in
March after a 15-month expansion. Nonresidential outlays, which had
dipped somewhat in March, also changed little. Public construction--
in a steady recovery from its recent low last summer--edged higher, but
remained below its peak in February of last year.

1/ Seasonally adjusted annual rates; preliminary. Data for the most
recent month (April) are available under a confidential arrange-
ment with the Census Bureau. Under no circumstances should public
reference be made to them.
Seasonally adjusted private housing starts, which had
turned downward in March, rose sharply in April to an annual rate of
1,620 thousand, the highest since early 1964. The rise probably
reflected in part a further acceleration of builder schedules at a
time when additional tightening in money markets seemed imminent and
mortgage commitments outstanding and building permits were still quite
high. The rise--which was out of line with initial projections and

II -18
which may be subject to downward revision--was apparently exaggerated
by technical measurement factors. For seasonal adjustment purposes,
Census makes no explicit allowance for working days. This year, the
number of working days in April (22) actually exceeded those in March
(21) for the first time since 1963 when starts also rose--by 9 per
cent--from March to April.
ultifamily starts, the most volatile component of the
total, accounted for the major share of the April rise, but single-
family starts also increased. Regionally, a surge occurred in the
Northeast states as was expected because of an unusually low March
rate. The West also showed a marked rise.
Unlike starts, seasonally adjusted permits dropped in April
and were the lowest since January. The decline affected both single-
family and multifamily structures and all regions except the West. On
the basis of this and other considerations, a decline over the remain-
ing months in the current quarter is to be expected. For technical and
other reasons, the decline may be particularly marked in June. Even
with the exceptionally high April rate, the average for the second
quarter as a whole is still expected to be a little below the advanced
first quarter rate now estimated by the Census Bureau at 1.5 million.

1/ Seasonally adjusted annual rates; preliminary.
Sales of new homes by speculative builders rose less than
seasonally in March, the latest month for which data are available.
But stocks of homes for sale by such builders--particularly homes
already completed--continued unusually small and equalled only 4.3
months' supply at the March rate of sales--even lower than a year
earlier when the supply amounted to 4.5 months' sales. Moreover,
while the median intended price of builders' stocks of homes was
unchanged, at $23,600, prices of the homes sold advanced sharply to a
new high of $24,400, nearly a tenth above a year earlier.
In the market for existing homes, with potential buyers
apparently willing to accept both higher interest rates and higher
prices, sales in March averaged almost a tenth above the level in
March of 1967 when such sales had already begun to revive. Average
prices of such houses, as in February, continued 4 per cent above a
year earlier, according to the National Association of Real Estate Boards.

II -20
Personal income. Personal income in April rose nearly $4.0
billion to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $670 billion, 8.7 per
cent more than a year earlier. April income was $11.0 billion, or
1.7 per cent, above the first quarter average.
April was the only month of the last six in which special
factors affecting personal income were about offsetting. Exclusive
of such influences, the April increase was only three-fourths as large
as the average rise in the November to March period.

Labor market. The labor market continued to show sub-
stantial strength in April, although the data were somewhat distorted
by unusual factors in the survey week. While the unemployment rate
declined for the second straight month, employment gains were only
moderate and hours of work fell off because of religious observances
and civil disorders. Unemployment claims through early May reflect
a pattern of continued tightness in the labor market.
Nonfarm payroll employment rose 100,000 in April, but when
the net return of workers from strike is taken into account, the in-
crease is reduced to 45,000--less than half of the March increase.
However, the increase in nonfarm employment so far this year has been
at a brisk rate, and the rise from April a year ago of 2.3 million was
the largest over-the-year gain since early in 1967. Employment in
nonmanufacturing industries showed less than its usual buoyancy--up by
only 35,000 in April--largely as a result of an increase in strike
activity in construction and a decline of 35,000 in retail trade.
The dip in retail trade probably reflected both the difficulties of
seasonal adjustment around Easter time and civil disturbances; trade
employment should rebound substantially in May.
In manufacturing, employment rose by about 75,000 in April,
of which almost 50,000 represented the net effects of returns, to
work after strikes, primarily in glass and copper, and new strikes
in fabricated metals.

II -22
Due to the combination of religious holidays and civil
disturbances during the survey week, hours of work fell in virtually
every major industry with the exception of construction. The workweek
in private nonfarm establishments was down two-tenths of an hour, and
in manufacturing three-tenths of an hour. As a result of the reduced
workweek, with less overtime at premium pay, manufacturing earnings
showed no change from the March level of $2.96 an hour.
The unemployment rate dipped again by one-tenth of a point,
and in April was back to the low January rate of 3.5 per cent. This
was nominally equal to the lowest rate attained since the Korean War,
but certain changes in the series at the beginning of 1967 had the
effect of lowering the unemployment rate slightly so that the data are
not entirely comparable; even so, the April rate reflects an extremely
tight labor market. The decline in April occurred largely among
teenagers whose unemployment rate fell over a point to 11.9 per cent.
The unemployment rate for adult men (age 25 and over) remained
extremely low--below 2 per cent.
Labor force. The 1.6 million increase in the total labor
force in the year ending in the first quarter of 1968 was about
"normal" but substantially smaller than the increase of more than 2
million the previous year when the armed forces expanded by half a
million. The civilian labor force increase, however, was not much less
than the rise a year earlier. The age composition of the increase has
shifted significantly with the teenage civilian labor force showing
little change this past year and with all of the rise occurring among
adult men and women.

Adult women 1,038 940
Teenagers 245 -50
As in other recent years, women accounted for the major
portion of the civilian labor force increase. The continued rapid
growth in the trade-service-State and local government complex has
provided ample job opportunities for women and their labor force
participation rate continued to rise. Rates of labor force partici-
pation for married women under 35 years with young children have
shown a significant rise in recent years. Increases in earlier years
had been more marked among women past 35 years.
The substantially larger increase in the number of adult
men entering the civilian labor force in the past year reflected both
the sharper rise in the number of young adults in the population and
the relative stability in military manpower. With more young persons
reaching the early twenties--the heritage of the post-World War II
bulge in births--the number of young men entering the civilian labor
force increased sharply over the past year. With the economy con-
tinuing to grow rapidly, the increased supply of adult men becomes

II -24
an important addition to available resources. In other recent years,
the small growth in the adult male population had tended to aggravate
scarcities of skilled labor.
Industrial relations. A pattern of first-year wage
increases substantially larger than for later years of the contract--
a so called "front load"--has been evident in a number of wage
settlements in recent months. A high first-year wage increase
(7 per cent) was an important feature of the automobile workers'
contracts negotiated last fall; this has not only set a pattern for
manufacturing contracts in other metal working industries but is appearing
in contracts negotiated in nonmanufacturing activities. According to
recent BLS data on major collective bargaining settlements negotiated
in the first quarter of this year, the median first-year increase in
nonmanufacturing was 7.7 per cent, as compared with 7.4 per cent in
manufacturing. The recent settlements in the telephone industry have
given added impetus to this trend. More than half of the 3-year wage
increase falls in the first year--9 per cent compared with 4 per
cent in the second and in the third years. Several settlements in
trade also appear to be following the pattern.
Collective bargaining agreements covering close to 2 million
workers are yet to be negotiated this year in such major industries as
aluminum, steel, shipbuilding, aerospace, apparel and construction, as
well as for additional communications workers. The spreading emphasis
on substantially higher first-year wage increases suggests continued strong

II -25
upward pressure on wages and unit labor costs in the current year.
This emphasis presumably reflects worker concern with the rising
cost of living and as long as these costs persist on this sharp
upward course, it is likely that the pattern of larger first-year
wage increases will continue.
Wholesale prices. The BLS wholesale price index increased
by only 0.1 per cent in April, rather than the 0.2 per cent estimated
earlier, to 108.3 per cent of the 1957-59 average. (CONFIDENTIAL UNTIL
RELEASE MAY 28.) The smaller-than-estimated increase resulted from a
decline of 0.1 per cent for farm products and processed foods and
feeds rather than a 0.1 per cent increase.
The April price rise for industrial commodities was 0.2
per cent, as estimated a month ago, but down from 0.3 per cent in March
and 0.5 per cent in February. As suggested by the table, the slower
rise in the industrial commodity total in April than in March stemmed
from a decline in sensitive industrial materials prices, which had
shown an exceptionally large rise from last August to March. The
April decline reflected primarily the beginning of a run-down in
average prices of copper--following the strike settlement--and a
further drop in steel scrap prices as mills curbed their scrap pur-
chases in anticipation of a possible steel strike. Lumber and
plywood prices continued to rise at a rapid rate.
Average prices of other (sluggish) materials, in contrast,
resumed an upward movement in April after showing no change in March,

II -26
when two, exceptionally large declines in container board and liquified
petroleum gas offset the steady and relatively widespread price upcreep
for many other materials (such as steel products and glass and other
construction materials).
Moreover, prices of both finished consumer and producer's
products stepped up a bit in April and increased at about the average
rates of the preceding 5 months.

Consumer prices. As reported in the Supplement to the
preceding Green Book, the BLS consumer price increased 0.4 per cent
in March, with sizable gains reported for foods, other commodities,
and services. The large March rise confirmed a move toward accelerating
increases in the CPI beginning in late 1967--with services and foods
accounting for the bulk of the step-up.
The April CPI will not be released until May 28, but pre-
liminary estimates indicate a further increase in retail food prices.
Another rise of 0.4 per cent in the total index seems quite likely.

II -27
Non-real-estate debt of farmers. Farmers owed approximately
$23.5 billion in non-real-estate debt at the end of 1967. The
increase of 10 per cent from a year earlier was about the same as the
average annual increase over the past 10 years. Among institutional
lenders, indebtedness to member banks showed the smallest increase
last year (7 per cent) and indebtedness to PCA's, the largest (17 per
cent). Farmers Home Administration lending for operating expenses and
other short-term purposes was determined by annual appropriation, as
usual. Although farmers indebtedness to banks increased more slowly
than to other institutions during 1967, member banks still held their
position as the major supplier of institutional credit to farmers,
as can be seen in the table.

Debt owed by farmers to nonreporting creditors probably
amounted to an additional $9.8 billion, assuming that the relationship
to institutionally-held farm non-real-estate debt now is the same as
in the 1960 benchmark year. Farmers interest expense on non-real-estate
debt in 1967 is estimated by the USDA at $1.4 billion, representing
about 4 per cent of farm production expenses.
Farmers are using more borrowed funds in their businesses
now than 10 years ago. Farm non-real-estate debt outstanding at the
end of 1967 was equal to 48 per cent of 1967 gross income and 68 per
cent of production expenses; 10 years earlier, the comparable ratios
were 25 and 38.
First quarter developments. Analysts are dependent almost
entirely on data reported by the production credit associations of
the Farm Credit Administration for indications of what has happened in
farm non-real-estate credit since the end of 1967. Nationally, loan
balances of the PCA's increased 6 per cent during the first quarter
reflecting, in part, the beginning of expanded seasonal demands for
production credit, particularly in the South. With the seasonal
influence removed, the upward trend in PCA balances during the quarter
was 3 per cent, indicating that the long-term upward trend in PCA
lending is continuing.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL SITUATION
Bank credit. Commercial bank credit, measured on a daily
average basis by the credit proxy, is currently projected to decline
at a 0.5 per cent annual rate in May. Adjusted to include changes
in non-deposit sources of funds (capital, bank liabilities to foreign
branches, and borrowing from Federal Reserve banks), the May credit
proxy would show a 1.7 per cent annual rate of increase, compared
with a 6.3 per cent annual rate for the first four months of the year,
similarly adjusted. Total loans and investments at all commercial
banks as measured by the end-of-month series, increased at a 7.7
per cent annual rate over the first four months, but sufficient
data are not yet available to present an adequate estimate for
May.
Following a $2-1/2 billion increase in late March and
early April, associated primarily with business loan expansion,
total loans and investments at large banks have declined from their
April peak--as indicated by the chart on the following page.
The approximate $400 million decline since early April reflects
both continued bank liquidation of Government security holdings and
the apparent leveling off of growth in bank loans since that date.
With only a modest expansion in total time and savings
deposit inflows following the recent increase in Regulation Q ceilings,
and somewhat tighter reserve positions, weekly reporting banks made
large reductions in their holdings of Treasury bills and moderate
reductions in Treasury notes and bonds through the first week in

May. Since the first of the year, large banks have liquidated al-
most $3 billion in Treasury bills while generally maintaining or
adding to holdings of longer-term Government securities, resulting
not only in a $2 billion decline in their total holdings of Govern-
ment securities, but also a significant lengthening of the maturity
structure of their portfolios.
In general, weekly reporting banks also reduced their holdings
of other securities--particularly short-term municipals by New York
City banks--in late April and early May. However, as a result of
recent heavy acquisitions of longer-term municipals by California
banks, total holdings of other securities showed an increase, on
balance, for this period.
The continued liquidation of bank short-term security
holdings has contributed to a further erosion of the liquidity banks
had accumulated in 1967. By May 1, the liquid asset/deposit ratio
at weekly reporting banks had receded by more than 60 per cent of
the increase from November 1966 to November 1967 (these two months
represent approximately the recent periods of lowest and highest
levels of bank liquidity, respectively). The loan/deposit ratio
also suggests that liquidity has declined appreciably at weekly
reporting banks since November 1967, although this ratio is not yet
as high as in November 1966. At large banks in New York, however,
the loan/deposit ratio is higher than in November 1966, reflecting
in part the recent concentration of CD attrition at these banks.

items in the process of collection.
Although business loans have increased about $4.0 billion,
on a seasonally adjusted basis, since the first of the year, there
has been no further net expansion since mid-April. However, this
apparent cessation of growth probably reflects in large part a lag
in the adjustment of seasonal factors to the increased volume of
corporate tax borrowing in April and the repayment of those borrowings
in late April and May. In addition, since mid-April, banks have
made substantial reductions in holdings of acceptances (included in
their business loan total).
Demands for business loans were probably also dampened to
some extent by the recent increase in the prime rate to 6-1/2 per
cent. Prior to the increase in the prime rate, commercial paper
rates, on an effective yield basis, had risen enough so that banks

III -5
compared favorably with the commercial paper market as a source of
funds. However, even with recent increases in commercial paper rates--
which for 4-6 month maturities, are now within 10 basis point of the
prime rate, on an investment yield basis--the commercial paper market
presents a less costly means of financings and has probably diverted
some loan demand from banks. Finally, with reduced deposit inflows
and tighter reserve positions, some banks are reported to be firming
lending policies.
While business loans within most industry categories generally
have been close to their usual volume, there have been some excep-
tions. For example, borrowing by primary metals, retail trade, and
textiles groups has tapered off following rapid expansion in recent
months. Borrowing by the mining category also dropped off sharply
after the early April increase associated with the acquisitions
of a subsidiary of Kennecott Copper Co. Loans to wholesale trade
(other than commodity dealers), services and "all other" categories
have shown more than seasonal strength since mid-April.
Real estate loans at all commercial banks continued to
expand in April and early May at close to the accelerated pace that
has prevailed since August, However, growth in consumer loans
slackened in April, reflecting in large part the falling off in
automobile sales last month. Finally, security loans fluctuated around
a downward trend in April, probably associated with the generally
higher level of rates on dealer loans.

III -6
Bank deposits. In spite of the recent increase in Regula-
tion Q ceilings, time and savings deposits at all commercial banks are
projected to increase at only a 2 per cent annual rate in May, on a
daily average basis, just marginally above the 1.3 per cent rate of
April and about one-third the pace of the first quarter. As market
rates advanced in recent weeks, CD rates moved quickly to the new
ceilings on shorter maturities, resulting in a relatively moderate
increase in CD's outstanding of $249 million at weekly reporting banks
in the three-week period ending May 8. Nevertheless, CD's accounted
for almost one-half of the expansion of total time and savings deposits
at large banks for this period, as inflows of consumer-type time
deposits remained weak in light of rising market yields.

After a decline of about $1-1/2 billion between the end
of February and mid-April, the subsequent rise in CD's outstanding
at large banks took place entirely in the last week of April, following
the increase in Regulation Q ceilings. During the first two weeks
in May, outstandings declined by $40 million on balance. Initially
banks appeared not very interested in longer-term CD's (6-month
maturities or more), since most banks kept their offering rates on
these maturities appreciably below the ceilings. In recent weeks,
however, with market yields rising above CD ceilings on all maturities,
banks have been unable to roll over their maturing CD's even with
offering rates pushed to the ceiling on all maturities. For the
week ending May 15, outstanding negotiable CD's declined $113 million
at large banks in New York and Chicago.

The weakness in consumer-type time deposits at large banks
reflects primarily the large outflow of regular passbook savings
deposits which began following the quarterly interest crediting
period at the end of March. The outflow was particularly large
during the first three reporting weeks in April, but in late April it
tapered off, and in the week of May 8 these deposits showed a small
rise. Over the entire six-week period, savings deposits fell $700
million. Growth in time certificates and open accounts remained
at the reduced pace prevailing since the end of February, and failed
to offset the savings deposit outflow during most of April. Over
the most recent three weeks, however, total consumer-type time deposits
showed a small net increase. Data for New York and Chicago for the
week ending May 15 do not indicate any sizable outflow of these funds
in response to the issuance of the Treaury's new 6 per cent notes.
With reduced deposit inflows, banks have made heavy use
of the Euro-dollar market in late April and early May. From mid-April
to mid-May, bank liabilities to foreign branches rose more than $600
million.
The money stock in May, on a daily average basis, is currently
projected to expand at a 6.0 per cent annual rate, down from the rapid
April pace, but still above the 4.5 per cent annual rate of growth
in the first quarter. With continued reductions in U.S. Government
deposits, the reduced rates of growth in bank credit and currency
outstanding resulted in a rate of expansion in the money stock only
somewhat below the 8.5 per cent pace of April.

Nonbank depositary intermediaries. In May, as in April,
rising market yields and attractive Treasury and Agency issues--
particularly the recent 6 per cent Treasury financing--probably
continued to contribute to a reduced rate of savings inflows at
nonbank financial intermediaries. Information available so far
for May indicates a relatively substantial deposit inflow to the
largest mutual savings banks in New York City during the first half
of the month. But this was accompanied by an unusually large
increase in passbook loans which reduced "adjusted" deposit inflow
to one-half the year-earlier amount as the table shows.

During April, net savings flows were particularly weak at both
S and L's in California and savings banks in New York State--two of
the most market-sensitive areas. Outflows (not seasonally adjusted)
at California associations were also increased by large State income
tax payments as well as sizable withdrawals of out-of-state funds.

With their outstanding mortgage commitments at a record
level and deposit outflows large, S and L's in April borrowed $290
million from the Federal Home Loan Banks, the largest amount since
July of 1966, though considerably less than the average for that
year. California associations accounted for most of the recent borrowing,
raising their total indebtedness above their holdings of cash and
Government securities for the first time in a year. S and L's outside
of California, however, generally continued in relatively strong
liquidity position. In April, liquidity at mutual savings banks--as
measured by their holdings of cash and Governments relative to deposits--
probably continued the downtrend of the last two years. However,
this decline in the traditional liquidity measure, is no doubt a
reflection of the additional marketability gained in portfolios of
these banks by their continued large acquisitions of corporate
bonds.
Mortgage market developments. As net savings flows to thrift
institutions slackened further through mid-May and bond yields rose,
the mortgage market apparently continued to tighten, and home
mortgage yields increased appreciably further.
Early in May, as soon as enabling legislation permitted,
contract interest rates on FHA and VA home mortgages were raised by
administrative action to 6-3/4 per cent from 6 per cent--a step that
somewhat reduced the record discounts inhibiting buyers, lenders, and
builders alike. While some investors had been holding back in antici-
pation of a rate increase, fragmentary reports suggest that the home

III -12
mortgage market as a whole remained under considerable restraint even
after FHA and VA contract rates had been raised, and that the rate
increase put some upward pressure on mortgage yields generally.
Restraint also reflected further uncertainty about tax legislation
and international developments, the perseverance of fairly substantial
discounts on the new 6-3/4 per cent FHA and VA loans, and the low
usury ceilings in some States.
Early in May, FNMA instituted its new weekly bidding proce-
dure for auctioning advance commitments to purchase FHA and VA home
mortgages under its secondary market operations./ Bids in FNMA's
auctions of May 13 and May 20 were the first to be based on the new
6-3/4 per cent contract interest rate. In the May 13 auction, the
average accepted bid price on 6-month commitments was equivalent to
an implied gross yield before servicing of as much as 7.35 per cent
in the private market, after allowing for FNMA commitment fees and
stock purchase required of all sellers; in the May 20 auction, the
implied average yield was even higher--7.45 per cent. Discounts on
the 6-3/4 per cent loans averaged 5 or more points in each auction.
For a number of reasons, including the special and still
novel nature of the "auctions," themselves, FNMA auction prices may
not have been entirely representative of private market conditions
with respect to both level and movement. However, they do imply
1/ See Appendix A for further details, along with additional discussion
about the change in FHA and VA ceiling rates.

III -13
that secondary market yields on FHA and VA home mortgages continued
upward during the first three weeks of May. If further increases
should occur in the period ahead, investment in home mortgages will
come under increasing restraint in 8 States with 7 per cent usury
ceilings, in addition to 6 States where usury limits are still 6 per
cent. These restrictive limits invariably apply to all conventional
loans and in some cases to FHA and VA mortgages as well. As in
indication of the share of the total market affected, the 14 States
with either 6 or 7 per cent usury ceilings accounted last year
for a third of all housing units for which building permits were
issued.
During April, yields required by lenders on home mortgages
accelerated to new postwar highs in both the primary and secondary
market, according to the FHA series shown in the table. Because returns
on new issues of high-grade corporate bonds declined temporarily in
April, the gross yield spread between home mortgages and such bonds
widened somewhat. But the spread gave no net incentive for mortgage
investment after allowance is made for servicing costs, which are
much higher on mortgages than on securities.

By the end of April, the seasonally adjusted backlog of out-
standing residential mortgage commitments of reporting lenders--which
reattained its end-of-1965 level in March--edged still higher to a
record postwar level, as shown in the table. However, in view of the
additional pressures on the home mortgage market during May the backlog
of commitments is likely to reverse direction and turn downward in
coming months.

Corporate and municipal bond markets. Yields in both
corporate and municipal markets advanced sharply following the May 15
announcement of a further delay in Congressional consideration of the
tax-expenditure package. Although this news came too late to affect
the corporate new issue yield series for that week, subsequent bidding
has driven yields on corporates to new peaks, as indicated by staff
estimates shown in the last line of the table. These estimates suggest
that corporate new issue yields are nearly 20 basis points above their
previous peak of less than a month ago. In the municipal market, the
recent yield rise is estimated to amount to about 25 basis points,
and yields in that market now match the peaks reached during the gold
crisis.

Contributing to these upward yield pressures has been the
large volume of unsold bonds. Recently, corporate underwriters
terminated price restrictions on five bond issues, which had been
priced far from market levels. In the municipal market, even after
price reductions, advertised inventories remain around $650 million,
and underwriters report that is an understatement of the actual amount
of unsold bonds. Although buyer hesitancy is prevalent in both
markets, the municipal market appears particularly influenced by the
notable lack of interest of the two major types of institutional
investors in municipals--commercial banks and fire and casualty insurance
companies. A further depressant in both markets is the very heavy
near-term volume of scheduled corporate and municipal bond offerings.
Public flotations of corporate bonds in May are estimated
at $1.2 billion, the largest volume this year and about half again
as large as the monthly average pace during the first four months.
The large volume partly reflects a number of issues expected late
in April that were offered in the first week of May, as well as the
recent addition of two large industrial issues scheduled to be
offered late in May--one of which might be pushed into June. Partially
offsetting this increased volume, two utility issues amounting to
$115 million were cancelled because of the level of rates; commercial
paper financing was used as a substitute for one of the issues.

Total bond and stock offerings of nearly $2.1 billion expected
in May have been held down by a revision in the estimated amount of
private placements, reflecting a slower growth than had been antici-
pated earlier. Final private placement data just received for the first
quarter indicate the volume of takedowns was below a year earlier--with
March exhibiting a substantially less than seasonal advance. Fragmentary
evidence, however, still points to a further expansion in takedowns of
1/private placements as the year progresses.-

Corporate bond offerings already scheduled for June amount
to nearly $700 million and may ultimately exceed $1.0 billion, but
in the current market environment this estimate cannot be very firm.
It is possible that the timing of a number of rumored industrial
financings may be accelerated if borrowers come to feel that interest
rates will move even higher. However, some other issues may be
postponed at this advanced level of yields--replaced by bank or money
market financing. The staff now estimates that total corporate bond
and stock offerings, including private placements, are likely to
aggregate nearly $2.0 billion in June, only slightly below both the
outsized May volume and the monthly average for 1967.
In the municipal market, estimated volume of new offerings
in May remains large, advancing above earlier estimates due to a late
build-up in the calendar. The May estimate of new issue volume stands
at $1.3 billion, slightly above April and equivalent to the monthly
average in the second quarter of last year. June volume is currently
estimated at $1.2 billion--but this again is unusually uncertain in
view of the upward rate pressures in this market and the possibility
that a significant volume of issues may be postponed. During the first
four months this year, announced postponements averaged about $110
million a month.-

Recent municipal bond volume has not been enlarged by industrial
aid issues and, if the current bill concerning the tax status of such
bonds is approved, their future volume should be extremely small. Only
issues of less than $1 million would be exempt from Federal income
taxes under the most recent proposal. Larger issues would be taxable
if issued after May 1, 1968, unless commitments had been made by that
date. In 1967, issues of less than $1 million comprised only 2.5 per
cent of the total volume of industrial aid financing.
Stock market. The general stock market exuberance, which
had been in evidence throughout April and early May, appears to have
abated. The net depressants seem to be the consensus that Vietnam
negotiations will not result in a quick settlement, and the uncertainty
surrounding Congressional action on any package of fiscal restraint.

Prices of New York Stock Exchange common stocks reached new all-time
highs in early May, but thereafter drifted lower. Trading volume on
the New York Exchange, while still heavy, also lost its upward momen-
tum. The enthusiasm for American Exchange issues has not yet been
dampened, however, as indicated in the tables below. This market
in the past has often been the last to reflect changes in investor
sentiments.

During April, when stock prices advanced steadily, margin
debt of broker and dealer customers rose $190 million (preliminary) to
a new high of $6,380 million. Analysis of stock market credit data
would suggest that, in part at least, these new margin purchases were
achieved through the use of existing or pre-existing collateral values
built up by rising stock values; only a part of the new purchases
involved the payment of the 70 per cent margin requirement in cash. In
contrast to the rise in stock prices and margin debt of broker and
dealer customers, bank purpose loans to non-brokers at weekly reporting
banks declined $20 million to $2,350 million in April; presumably
the decline reflects the further loss of convertible bond margin
business to brokers and dealers, as well as the more rigorous purpose
statement now required from customers.
The application of margin requirements between mid-March
and mid-May to the financing of dealers' new positions in certain
convertible bonds does not appear to have adversely affected the
price of such bonds in the secondary market. An analysis of converti-
ble bonds shows that, after the elimination of the effects of rising
stock values, prices of outstanding convertible bonds remained
unchanged to slightly higher over the period.
Corporate profits. Corporate profits before taxes showed
another sharp increase in the first quarter to a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of $88.8 billion, according to preliminary Department
of Commerce estimates--about the level the staff has been projecting.
Most of the $3.7 billion rise over the fourth quarter rate represented

III -23
increased inventory profits. As a result, profits after inventory
valuation adjustment (that is, profits calculated so as to eliminate
the effect of price changes on corporate valuation of inventories)
rose only $1.6 billion in the first quarter. And staff estimates
show most of this increase as having occurred outside of manufacturing
and trade.

For manufacturing corporations, the ratio of profits before
taxes to sales appears to have risen about as much in the first quarter
of this year as it did in the preceding quarter. But, at a seasonally
adjusted rate of 8.7 per cent, the profit ratio--though inflated by
inventory profits--was still well below the levels of 1965 and early
1966.

Despite the continued increase in labor costs, profit margins
of manufacturers--and therefore profits before tax for manufacturers
and in turn for all corporations--seem likely to rise further in the
second quarter. Economic activity is projected to expand at least
as rapidly as in the first quarter and inventory profits are likely
to be even larger. Moreover, profits in the current quarter will not
be dampened as in the first quarter by the increases, effective
during that quarter, in the social insurance tax rate and the minimum
wage.
U.S. Government securities market. Yields on U.S.
Government securities have risen substantially further since the
last meeting of the Open Market Committee, and in most maturity
areas are at or close to new post-World War II highs. Advances on
short and intermediate-term maturities other than very short bills
have ranged from 25-40 basis points and those on long-term bonds have

III 25
averaged about 16 basis points. Recent increases in yields on Treasury
bills have carried their levels for the first time above the highs
reached at the height of the credit crunch in 1966. Similarly, yields
on coupon issues, with the exception of long-term bonds, have exceeded
their previous highs, touched briefly at the height of the gold crisis
in mid-March of this year.

Most of the further yield advance has occurred recently,
in response to the sudden worsening of prospects for effective fiscal
action. Coming at a time when professional inventories in domestic
securities markets were generally large, when the ability of the
banking system to attract new funds with large CD's was already

III -26
becoming quite limited, and when international markets for sterling
and gold were under deepening pressure, the changed outlook on
taxes reawakened fears aong market participants of an impending
domestic credit crunch and international financial crisis.
Yield advances have been particularly sharp on issues with
maturities adjacent to the two new 6 per cent notes offered in the
Treasury's May refinancing. The yield on the new 15-month maturity
has risen to 6.37 per cent and that on the 7-year maturity to 6.16
per cent. Reception of these issues had been unexpectedly favorable
during the financing when for a time Congressional progress on the
fiscal package seemed on balance to be favorable. But with the
recent shift in market psychology, dealers and others who had established
temporary positions in these issues have pressed to liquidate them;
while investors generally have held back in committing available
funds. Just prior to settlement on the financing, dealer holdings
of all Treasury coupon issues due after 5 years amounted to about
$600 million and their holdings of 1-5 year maturities to $490 million.
These positions have since been reduced to $345 and $340 million,
respectively, the former largely through market purchases for Treasury
trust accounts.
While yields on longer-term bill maturities began to edge
somewhat higher early in May in reflection of the end of April monthly
bill auction and the new 15-month issue offered for cash in the May
financing, the yield on three-month bills remained close to the
5.50-5.55 per cent range--prevailing at the time of the last Open
Market Committee meeting--until nearly mid-May. Demand for shorter-bill

III -27
maturities had been strong in the latter part of April. And the choice
of a "rights" financing for the new 7-year note in the May financing
created some continuing demand for such issues. Even before the
deterioration in prospects for fiscal action, however, the cumulative
impact of a persistently tight money market on dealer financing costs
had already begun to exert upward pressures on shorter-term Treasury
bill yields. When the change in fiscal outlook developed, therefore,
the reaction of bill rates was particularly sharp.
Other short-term rates. In line with the general rise in
interest rates, yields on short-term obligations other than bills
have also increased substantially since the last meeting of the
Committee. Secondary market yields on Federal Agency securities
in the 3 to 6-month area, for example, have climbed more than 1/2 a
percentage point over the period. And a new 9-month issue of Federal
Intermediate Credit Bank debentures was just offered to yield 6.45
per cent--25 basis points higher than expected when the issue was
first announced.
Yields on commercial paper, finance company paper and bankers'
acceptances have gained about 1/4 of a percentage point, raising the
rate of 6-month acceptances to 6.25 per cent on a bank discount basis
the highest return on this kind of an instrument since 1920.
With yields on market securities pushing up to these
high levels, rates on new CDissues at New York banks have been
forced to their ceilings, and in the secondary market, yields on
CD's have moved to levels well above the ceilings.

Federal finance. Treasury cash borrowing requirements in
the weeks immediately ahead will be significantly affected by the
manner in which Congress and the President finally dispose of the
package of fiscal proposals recently endorsed by the Senate-House
conference. Because of the inevitable delays involved in changing
expenditure programs, no significant cut backs in Federal outlays
can be expected during the next two to three months, regardless of
how Congress finally resolves the spending-cut issue. And the
excise tax rates now scheduled to be reduced on May 31 are likely
to be maintained without change, even if Congress fails to go along
with the rest of the package of tax increases. But the volume of
near-term receipts from income taxes will be substantially affected
by what Congress decides on the surtax and the further acceleration
of corporate income tax payments.
For any receipts from these latter provisions to be
collected in fiscal 1968, favorable action on the fiscal package
must be taken by June 1. Enactment of the proposal by that date
would raise an estimated $1.3 billion of additional receipts in June.
If the conference proposal is approved after June 1 but
before July 1, while no payments on the surtax of the speed-up of
corporate income taxes would be collected in June, payments from
these items would become due by July 15. If the due date were not
until July 15, however, corporations would be required under the
proposed law to pay on only one-third of their second quarter surtax

III -30
liability, rather than on the full liability as would be the case
if the due date were June 15 (and hence in the same quarter as the
liability).
The table shows more explicitly how prospective increments
in the estimated flow of both corporate and personal income tax
receipts would vary depending on the timing of final approval of
the fiscal package.

Many observers are now predicting that the hassle on spending
cuts will result in a failure to enact either the surtax or the further
acceleration of advance payments on-corporate taxes. If this should
prove to be the case, the only special addition to Treasury cash
flows in the immediate offing would be the new $500 million offering
of Export-Import Bank participation certificates, scheduled for
payment on June 19. Under this--hopefully extreme--assumption, the
Treasury would end the fiscal year with an estimated cash balance

III -31
of about $5 billion. A cash balance this low would require the Treasury
to borrow nearly $5 billion in July, and at least an additional $4 billion
in August, as the table shows.

Since funds from the July cash borrowing would be needed by
mid-month, the Treasury might decide to go to the market as early
as late June, when a sizeable volume of funds would be released
to investors that held maturing June tax bills but did not use them
to pay taxes. However, near-term Treasury borrowing could, of course,
be somewhat smaller and deferred until well into July, if favorable
action on the tax package should swell receipts in June. Moreover,
a part of the large July-August need could be met by continuing to
raise new money in weekly bill auctions after the cycle of weekly
increments already in process stops. The present schedule of addi-
tions to 3-month bills terminated with the auction of May 20, and
that for 6-month bills ends with the auction of June 24.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
Gold and foreign exchange markets. Developments in recent
weeks have reflected increasing uncertainties about relative currency
parities and a more bullish atmosphere in gold markets. The markets
have been sensitive to news about fiscal action or inaction by Congress.
Gold prices fluctuated in the neighborhood of $39.50 from the
first of May until the middle of last week, the rising trend during April
having apparently been checked by profit-taking sales by speculators.
Rumors of continental currency revaluations began to circulate
in the second week of May. Until then, most major continental central banks
were either staying out of the exchange markets or selling dollars in
support of their own currencies. After about May 9, exchange markets
became quite unsettled; the German mark and Swiss franc were strongly bid
and sterling turned down, requiring substantial support by the Bank of
England.
In the middle of last week South Africa's statement that it would
continue to withhold its newly mined gold from the private market and the
news that the Congress would delay action on the fiscal package started
(I) a flurry of gold buying that brought the price to about $41.50 by the
end of last week and to about $42.50 by the beginning of this week; (2)
speculative (or precautionary) buying of marks and Swiss francs; and (3)
large scale selling of sterling that brought the spot rate to new lows
and necessitated substantial support by the Bank of England.

IV -2
Euro-dollar borrowing by U.S. banks. During April and May
the rise in liabilities of U.S. banks to their branches abroad has
accelerated. In the six weeks from Wednesday April 3 to Wednesday
May 15 these liabilities increased by about $700 million. The greater
part of this rise, about $500 million, occurred at banks outside
New York. But at New York banks there was a further $300 million increase
from last Wednesday to Monday May 20. There can be little doubt that
movements out of sterling have been contributing significantly to the
availability of funds in the Euro-dollar market.
Interest rates on Euro-dollar deposits of all maturities rose
sharply in March to nearly equal their 1966 peaks, and then fell off
somewhat after the gold rush ended. Since early April, with U.S. inter-
est rates rising and U.S. banks adding further to their already large
borrowings in the Euro-dollar market, a new rise in Euro-dollar rates has
occurred. The spreads between Euro-dollar rates and the Federal funds
rate have been more or less normal in size during the past four months,
except during the gold rush in March. On May 22 the call deposit rate
stood at 6.50 per cent, a record high except for a brief moment at the
end of December 1967, and the 3-month rate was 7 per cent.

U.S. balance of payments. Preliminary information indicates
that the April deficit on the liquidity basis was about $550 million
(not seasonally adjusted). Special transactions during the month were
$170 million, principally the purchase of the fourth and final $125 mil-
lion nonconvertible medium-term DM bond by Germany under the agreement
of last year. The April deficit before special transactions was about
$700 million, about $175 million greater than in April 1967.
On the official reserve transactions basis, the April deficit
is roughly estimated at about $400 million, not seasonally adjusted.
U.S. liabilities to foreign monetary authorities increased in April
following a large decline in the first quarter associated with foreign
private and official gold buying in March. The U.S. gold stock declined
further in April by $156 million and U.S. official holdings of foreign
currencies increased by about $60 million.
Bank claims on foreigners reported under the foreign credit
restraint program increased in April by about $70 million, a greater
than seasonal outflow. In the first quarter there was a large inflow.
The first quarter balance of payments data recently released
by the Department of Commerce differ a little from those shown in the
supplement to the last Green Book. On the liquidity basis the deficit
for the first quarter was published as $600 million, seasonally ad-
justed. On the official reserve transactions basis, the balance was
given as a deficit of $520 million, seasonally adjusted.
The principal developments in the first quarter were
the sharp drop in the balance on goods and services, particularly

IV -5
merchandise trade, and a more than offsetting improvement in capital
transactions. Net sales of U.S. securities to foreign markets in the
first quarter were very high and included $560 million of newly-issued
bonds sold by U.S. corporations to finance their direct investments
abroad (see below). Foreigners' net purchases of outstanding U.S.
stocks during the first quarter as a whole were $275 million; however,
in March, the month of the gold rush, such purchases dropped sharply.
Net U.S. purchases of foreign securities amounted to about
$400 million, after seasonal adjustment, in the first quarter, compared
with $365 million in the previous quarter.
U.S. foreign trade. The trade surplus in the first quarter
fell to $0.4 billion at an annual rate (balance of payments basis),
less than one-third of the very low rate of $1.3 billion (revised) in
the fourth quarter. The surplus in the first quarter of 1967 was nearly
$4.0 billion at an annual rate.

IV -6
A major element in the reduction of the trade surplus in the
first quarter of the year was the sharp drop in exports in March. The
11-day longshoremen's strike in New York at the end of March is esti-
mated to have accounted for about one-half the drop in March exports,
although a more complete evaluation may be possible when April trade
data are available. The remaining half of the export decline may be
attributed to a particularly sharp drop in shipments to Canada, par-
ticularly cars; reduced deliveries of commercial aircraft; and a
decline in exports of agricultural commodities. Little, if any, of
these commodity categories, move through the port of New York.
The low March rate of aircraft exports appears to be temporary.
Reported deliveries in April are at the high January-February rate.
Automotive exports to Canada in March may have slowed because of the
strike in GM plants there during February and March. With automotive
production in Canada at record rates in April and May, a sharp increase
in deliveries of automotive equipment above the low March level may be
expected.
Export orders for machinery, seasonally adjusted, have
expanded sharply in the last two quarters; these new orders may result
in increased shipments of such equipment toward the end of this year.
Imports in March are also believed to have been affected by
the New York port strike, although to a lesser degree than exports.
A rough approximation indicates that March imports would have been
$50-75 million higher if it were not for the strike.

IV -7
Despite the strike, all commodity categories of imports in
the first quarter advanced sharply over the exceptionally high values
of the fourth quarter. Arrivals of metals were especially large. In
addition to copper and steel, increased quantities of aluminum were
imported, reflecting mainly greater domestic requirements but also
possibly some hedge buying pending the outcome of the labor contract
negotiations in the aluminum industry.
Imports of other industrial materials -- wool and other
textile materials, building materials, and paper -- also expanded
sharply. The unusually severe winter required heavy purchases of
fuel oil in the first quarter. Arrivals of crude petroleum, however,
were still below normal as tanker schedules have not yet returned to
the pre-Middle-East war pattern.
Purchases of foreign machinery, both electrical and non-
electrical types, which had been on a high plateau in the last half
of 1967, expanded by 10 per cent in the first quarter to a new high.
Automobiles and other nonfood consumer goods also shared in
the strong growth in imports in the first three months of the year.
Arrivals of U.S. type cars from Canada were up by nearly 30 per cent
over those in the fourth quarter. Purchases of European and Japanese
cars were also exceptionally heavy, with sales in the U.S. in the first
four months 40 per cent higher than in the corresponding period of 1967.
The increased popularity of the Volkswagen in the U.S. this year has
been attributed to the availability of semi-automatic transmissions in

IV -8
these cars. Approximately 20 per cent of all Volkswagens sold in the
U.S. in the first four months were reported to be so equipped.
The largest expansion in other consumer goods has been in
the nondurable sector, mainly apparel but also footwear. The ex-
pansion in purchases of foreign durable consumer goods other than cars
was much less marked.

Euro-bond issues by U.S. corporations. The mandatory foreign
direct investment control program has produced a sharp expansion of U.S.
corporate security issues in Europe to finance capital outlays abroad.
In the first four months of this year U.S. companies have
offered for sales on the Euro-bond market over $700 million of long-
term obligations, about $600 million of which have been convertible
debentures. The total compares to similar issues of only $130 million
in the first four months of last year and $527 million for 1967 as a
whole. (These figures cover issues, most of which are denominated in
dollars, offered for placement in more than one foreign capital market;
in January-April 1968 U.S. companies have offered over $50 million in
long-term obligations on single foreign capital markets.) The table
below outlines recent trends in Euro-bond financing by U.S. companies
and others.

Financial market conditions abroad. In the past four months
few important changes have occurred in financial conditions abroad,
except in Canada where interest rates are now sharply higher than they
were in January. In continental Europe, despite rising Euro-dollar
interest rates and a large volume of bond issues by U.S. companies, and
despite the continuing expansion of European business activity, interest
rates are in many instances relatively low and have generally not risen
much in recent months; in Germany and Switzerland long-term yields have
even declined a little. In Britain, on the other hand, stringent credit
restrictions remain in force and interest rates are high. However,
because of large forward discounts on sterling in the exchange market,
covered interest differentials are very unfavorable for movements into
sterling. In Japan, credit conditions remain tight, and interest rates
have been rising.
In the United Kingdom long-term rates have remained high and
sticky because of fears of inflation, uncertainties about the pound, and
expectations that the government will continue its tight money policy.
Long-term government bond yields rose last year from May until near year-
end, and since then have been close to the 1966 highs.
Short-term rates such as local authority deposit rates which
are not tied to the Bank of England's Bank Rate have risen significantly
since January, influenced by increased yields on dollar assets and the
persistence of large discounts on forward sterling. In consequence of
the high cost of deposit funds, local authorities have increased their
borrowing from the clearing banks.

IV -13
The March 21 lowering of Bank Rate from 8 per cent to 7-1/2
per cent followed by two days the presentation of the 1968-69 budget,
announcing a severe fiscal policy. Though generally it was hoped that
interest rates could be allowed to come down from crisis levels, the
Bank rate reduction involved no easing of the credit restrictions imposed
last November. These restrictions limit bank credit to the private sector
to not more than the amount outstanding at the time of devaluation, with
exceptions only where loans contribute in some way to improvement of the
balance of payments.
Persistence of uncertainties about the pound reflects in part
the absence as yet of a clear turn for the better in Britain's trade accounts.
Recent trade developments are analyzed in an Appendix which will be circu-
lated with the Supplement to this Greenbook. In summary, the principal
cause of concern is the unexpectedly high import volume in recent months,
evidently associated with restocking of materials as well as with the pre-
Budget bulge in consumption.
In Germany, continued monthly balance of payments surpluses and
the Bundesbank's easy monetary policy have led to further increases in the
liquidity of the banking system. As a result, interest rates in Germany
have not risen significantly despite a substantial increase in credit demand.
Rates for 3-month inter-bank loans have recently leveled off at
around 3-5/8 per cent after rising seasonally in February and the first
half of March from low January levels. The March gold crisis upset fi-
nancial markets temporarily; speculative inflows and the temporary cessation
of money exports by German commercial banks caused call money rates in
Germany to fall from around 3 per cent in the second week to an average of

IV -14
2.60 per cent in the third week of March despite the incidence of a major
tax date at that time. Call money rates again rose above 3 per cent in
the early part of April, but dropped below 2 per cent toward the end of
that month.
An interest-arbitrage equilibrium has been maintained between
Euro-dollar rates and German money rates through a widening of the forward
premium on the German mark against the dollar. In the first week of May,
for example, the 3-month forward premium of 2.9 per cent just matched the
difference between the 3-month Euro-dollar rate of 6.5 per cent and the
3-month German interbank loan rate of 3.6 per cent. (During February the
forward premium on the DM against the dollar had been about 2 per cent, and
in mid-March it rose briefly to 4 per cent.)
Since last November the Bundesbank has from time to time pro-
vided the German banks with dollar swaps at forward rates more attractive
than those available in the market. During the intervals, sometimes quite
brief, when such swaps are made their impact is of course either to keep
the market premium on the forward DM (or discount on the forward dollar)
smaller than it would otherwise be or to stiffen German money market rates
relative to Euro-dollar rates. The Bundesbank has attempted to minimize
the latter effect, by operating mainly at times when speculative inflows
of funds were occurring or feared.
During the five months November through March outstanding swaps
increased by $858 million, white net external dollar assets of the banks
increased by only $170 million as may be seen in the table. Speculative
inflows may have affected the banks' dollar holdings in two ways: they

IV -15
may have repatriated uncovered dollar assets, or they may have reduced
their spot holdings in consequence of customers' forward sales of dollars
to them. Moreover, after entering into swaps with the Bundesbank, banks
may have sold dollars in the market -- i.e., in effect, back to the
Bundesbank -- while retaining the forward contract side of the swap.

The changes in German banks' external liabilities have affected
primarily their DM deposit liabilities to banks and others outside Germany;
there is some evidence of windowdressing operations at the year-end. While
the banks' DM liabilities to nonresidents have been expanding over the whole
period covered by the table, the net increase during the month of March
(when speculative inflows occurred) was not particularly large.
Long-term bond yields (public authority bonds) have declined by
about 20 basis points since January. After rising slightly during February
and March, yields declined noticeably during April and early May.
Since last October yields on German domestic bonds have been
lower than on foreign DM bonds, and since November or December lower than

IV -16
yields on dollar Euro-bonds. New issues of foreign DM bonds have been
large in recent months. The Bundesbank in its latest Monthly Report
has expressed the view that this development, which is desirable for the
balance of payments, creates no problem for the domestic capital market
that would call for special controls. See Appendix D.
Swiss short-term interest rates, which rose last autumn and
fell in January along with Euro-dollar rates and German rates, have held
steady at a low level in recent months.
It appears from press and embassy reports that the French authori-
ties are continuing to pursue the moderately expansionary monetary policy
which prevailed in 1967 when the money supply was allowed to increase at
a slightly higher rate than real GNP.
Short-term interest rates have risen moderately. Bond yields
declined a little in April, but are still above the 1967 average.
Further steps in the program of reform of financial markets have
been taken. Restrictions on new capital issues other than those of oil
companies were removed on April 15, except for the requirement that issues
of more than FF 15 million ($3 million) must be scheduled by the under-
writing banks with the government. In addition, new techniques for float-
ing bond issues will involve lower commissions and higher coupon rates.
In Italy, long-term bond yields have continued to rise very
gradually. Expansion of bank credit and the money supply remains fairly
rapid, but has decelerated a little. While the balance of payments continues
to provide liquidity to the banking system, central bank credit to the
Treasury has declined somewhat since mid-1967 and the banks have had to
increase their borrowings from the Bank of Italy.

IV -17
Despite a rise in the level of economic activity and a decline
in official external reserves, interest rates tended to move downward in
Belgium during the first four months of 1968. The National Bank of
Belgium encouraged this tendency by reducing the discount rate on March 7
from 4 per cent to 3.75 per cent. Bond yields have also declined a little.
Monetary policy in the Netherlands has retained the relatively easy stance
of last year. Short-term rates have tended to decline somewhat from
January levels, while long-term rates have risen slightly.
The most important recent influence on Swedish interest rate
levels was the reduction from 6 to 5-1/2 per cent in the Bank of Sweden's
basic discount rate, effective February 9. This action reversed in part
the 1 per cent rate increase in mid-December, when there was a flurry of
speculative pressure in exchange markets and a sizable drain on official
reserves. The recent quickening of economic activity in Sweden, reflect-
ing the strengthened cyclical revival in Germany, suggests that the Swedish
authorities may delay any further discount rate reduction until other
central banks signal the way.
Thus far in 1968 Canadian monetary policy has been largely
dominated by the need to deal with serious pressures on Canada's foreign
exchange reserves and with continuing inflation. The Bank of Canada's
reactions to these problems and to increases in U.S. money market rates
forced both short- and long-term rates to extraordinarily high levels by
late March. An easing of the pressures on the Canadian dollar in foreign
exchange markets then created expectations of somewhat easier monetary
conditions later in the year, and long-term rates declined somewhat during

IV -18
the first half of April. During the last few weeks, with U.S. rates
rising, Canadian long-term rates have risen somewhat, but remain below
the March peak. Short-term rates, however, have not come down at all.
The announcement of the U.S. balance of payments program at
the first of the year caused immediate pressure on the Canadian exchange
market, and the Bank of Canada reacted by raising the bank rate by a full
percentage point on January 21. The Treasury bill rate rose one percentage
point between mid-January and the end of February. Yields on medium- and
long-term issues rose less than half as much during this period, but con-
tinued to rise rapidly on into March.
Serious pressures on Canadian foreign exchange reserves con-
tinued into March, and the Bank of Canada consequently matched the 1/2
percentage point increase in the U.S. discount rate on March 17. Pressures
on the Canadian dollar were finally eased in late March by two factors:
the exclusion of Canada from the U.S. balance of payments program earlier
that month, and the gold pool communique of March 17.
The calming of the exchange market and the final passage of Canada's
income tax surcharge on March 15 were greatly encouraging to the bond market.
After the completion of a sizable government bond flotation on April 1,
yields on Canadian medium- and long-term bonds fell by almost 40 basis
points. As already noted, these yields have subsequently risen somewhat.
Increased official optimism about the Canadian balance of payments and
market confidence in the Canadian dollar is suggested by the fact that the
Bank of Canada did not match the April Federal Reserve discount rate increase --
which, however, is not so remarkable in view of the fact that the Canadian
rate is already at 7-1/2 per cent.

IV -19
Credit conditions have remained tight in Japan. The rate of
credit expansion has slackened a little, and interest rates have increased
further.
During January-February commercial bank loans and discounts were
up 15 per cent from a year earlier, a slightly smaller rate of expansion
than earlier. Banks have reportedly grown increasingly cautious in their
lending, in response to Bank of Japan guidelines on credit expansion and
rediscounting.
The average rate on commercial bank loans and discounts, which
reached a low of 7.28 per cent last August, has been rising steadily and
in March was 7.49 per cent. Yields on most classes of bond issues have
increased since last September. The over-month-end call loan rate rose to
8.76 per cent by February 20 and has remained at that level since. On
April 23 the interest rate for dollar import acceptance credits was raised
again from 8.375 per cent to 8.625 per cent, and there was a further in-
crease to 8.725 per cent on May 9.

APPENDIX A: CHANGES IN CEILING MORTGAGE RATES AND FNMA OPERATIONS*
Two recent structural changes in the residential mortgage
market have enhanced the competitive position of FHA and VA mortgages
relative to conventional mortgages and other types of investments.
These changes should eventually promote improved adjustments in a sector
of the housing market that now accounts for about a fifth of all trans-
actions. However, their near-term effect will probably contribute only
marginally to the total flow of mortgage credit.
FHA and VA ceiling rates. On May 7, the President approved
Public Law 90-301, which suspends until October 1, 1969, statutory
limits applicable to interest rates on all FHA and VA mortgage programs
The limits had formerly been 6 per cent on home loans, and from 5-1/4
to 6 per cent on multifamily loans. Such ceilings had become increas-
ingly unrealistic for some time, as yields required by lenders on home
mortgages rose to a postwar high of nearly 7 per cent in April. To
attract investors under these conditions, FHA and VA loans carrying
contract rates of 6 per cent or less had to be discounted to an increas-
ing extent that inhibited lending as well as borrowing.
The same legislation also authorized a regulatory rate ceiling
adequate "to meet the mortgage market." Acting under this authority,
FHA specified an across-the-board limit of 6-3/4 per cent for all market-
rate programs, and VA also set a 6-3/4 per cent ceiling on home loans
that it guarantees. (As before, an additional insurance premium of 1/2
of 1 per cent will continue to be required on FHA-insured mortgages.)
The new higher contract interest rates, which helped to
reduce the exceptionally large discounts formerly prevailing on FHA
and VA loans, accordingly eased pressures toward higher home prices.
Since Government regulations require sellers to absorb all but 1 point
of any discount, the large discounts in some cases had been capitalized
in whole or in part in higher prices of new and used homes purchased
with Government-underwritten loans. In other cases, they had caused
sellers to refuse to offer their homes for sale subject to FHA and VA
loans, and had compelled buyers to resort, where possible, to other
forms of financing under less liberal loan-to-value or maturity limits.
Other structural problems, however, will continue to restrain
lending on Government-underwritten home mortgages in some areas during
coming months. Currently, 3 States with 6 per cent usury ceilings do
not except VA loans. In a number of additional States, FHA and VA loans
are excepted only for certain types of lenders and not for others.
* Prepared by Robert M. Fisher, Senior Economist, Capital Markets Section.

A-2
Pending new legislation, rates on affected Government-under-
written loans in such States must accordingly remain at the 6 per cent
limit applicable to conventional mortgages as well. For this and other
reasons, efforts have been accelerated in a number of States to raise
usury ceilings and/or permit more exceptions from them, thereby easing
this barrier to home-mortgage investment.
Finally, another provision of the legislation signed by the
President raised the maximum amount of guarantee on VA home mortgages
to $12,500 from $7,500.
FNMA operations. Under the so-called Free Market System,
inaugurated May 6, the Federal National Mortgage Association established
a weekly auction-type procedure for pricing its forward commitments to
purchase FHA and VA home mortgages under its secondary market operations.
Under this System, FHMA announces in advance the total volume of purchase
commitments it will accept each week, subject to FHMA approval of bids.
Approved sellers are invited to submit competitive or non-competitive
bids covering mortgages for delivery at the seller's option to FNMA
within 3 or 6 months (on new or used houses) or within 12 months (on
houses not yet started). For each auction, FNMA specifies more or less
standard conditions governing maximum and minimum bid amounts,
acceptable loan characteristics, and purchase fees and other charges.
Under its former practice, FNMA set purchase prices for mort-
gages on new or used houses for delivery within 2-1/2 months (immediate
purchase) or usually 12 months (standby commitments), and the market
determined the volume of offerings. Since FNMA's price schedule was
changed infrequently, mortgage offerings to FNMA rose sharply when FNMA
prices remained well above prices prevailing in the private market.
When its own resources were under pressure, FNMA also imposed certain
non-price restrictions from time to time as an additional means of
limiting offerings. This practice created uncertainty among private
sellers about what FNMA might do next and inefficiency in FNMA's ability
to adjust its support to meet the most pressing requirements of indivi-
dual local markets.
FNMA's new Free Market System will accordingly give FNMA
direct control over its weekly volume of offerings, and permit more
realistic pricing and allocation of what commitments are auctioned each
week. At the same time, FNMA's purchase prices should become more
directly attuned to changes in yields on competitive long-term invest-
ment,

A-3
FNMA's auction bids imply that secondary market yields
on FHA and VA home mortgages rose markedly during the first three
weeks of May. While informal reports from other sources also indicate
a rapid rise, the increase suggested by the FNMA bids undoubtedly also
reflects private market inexperience with FNMA's new operating procedure.
In time, however, the bid price data may well prove to be relatively
precise weekly indicators of trends in secondary market yields on FNMA
and VA home mortgages to be delievered within the prescribed time
limits. In interpreting the results, allowance will always have to be
made, of course, for any changes in FHNA's weekly auction limit and
for possible differences in the quality of mortgages offered to FNMA
compared with the quality of loans sold to private investors.
In its first three auctions, FNMA accepted total weekly bids
of $40 million (May 6) and $50 million (May 13 and 20), and announced
limits of $50 million and $60 million on the auctions of May 27 and
June 3, respectively. These limits are close to the weekly average
volume of mortgages offered to FNMA earlier in 1968 under its former
procedure. This suggests that FNMA's support of the market will continue
to be quite large in coming months if mortgage yields required by lenders
remain high. Prospective builders of homes not yet. under construction
may come to find FNMA's 12-month purchase commitments of special help
if private lenders cut back hard on their longer-term commitments.

APPENDIX B: LIFE INSURANCE POLICY LOANS AND COMMIITMENTS IN THE FIRST
QUARTER*
An estimated $2.9 billion cash flow was invested by a sample
of life insurance companies in the first quarter. This represented a
fairly normal first quarter volume and showed a normal seasonal reduc-
tion from the fourth quarter. Sources of investment funds--return
flows from mortgages and securities and funds from insurance sales,
as well as short-term bank borrowings--also followed generally typical
first-quarter patterns.
An increase in policy loans made by the sampled companies
during the first quarter decreased funds available for other invest-
ments by 7.5 per cent, as shown in Table 1. The growth in policy
loans represented a normal seasonal phenomenon, however, which has
occurred regularly in every first quarter since 1957, except in 1967
when special conditions prevailed. The share of net investment funds
absorbed by policy loan growth has nevertheless remained relatively
large by pre-1966 standards. Moreover, among 15 companies that account
for the bulk of policy loans in the industry, February through April
in 1968 show increased policy-loan activity over prior years.

The current structure of interest rates favors policy-loan
borrowing even more strongly than in earlier years. While borrowing
rates on outstanding policy loans have generally remained at 5 per cent,
other interest rates have risen substantially since 1966. Scattered
reports suggest that the bulk of current policy-loan borrowers may be
individuals borrowing relatively small amounts, while in 1966 there
was evidence that many were relatively large business borrowers.
* Prepared by Barbara N. Opper, Economist, Capital Markets Section.

Although these policy-loan indices suggest increased activity
this year, it should be noted that the industry undoubtedly has less
of its expected future cash flow committed now than was the case in
late 1965-early 1966. 1/ The industry appears to have more leeway
now to accommodate unexpectedly large increases in policy loans and
decreases in fund inflows available for other investments.
A slackening in the first-quarter volume of new commitments
indicates a rather cautious industry posture. As indicated in Table 2,
however, the stock of commitments outstanding remained at near-peak
levels. Despite unprecedented yields available on corporate direct
placements, their volume of new commitments was relatively modest in
the first quarter. An important factor underlying this relative
increase in mortgage commitments is the industry's "Billion Dollar
Program", a plan to provide funds for urban projects, of which around
$400 million has been committed.

APPENDIX C: ESTIMATED IMPACTS OF CREDIT MARKET CONDITIONS ON STATES
AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT FINANCING AND CAPITAL OUTLAYS*
Results of the 1966 State and local borrowing survey, though
preliminary, may be helpful in estimating the real impacts of recent
restrictive credit conditions on that sector's borrowing and capital
outlays. 1/ Summary tabulations, adjusted to take into account the
response rate and the relative sample size, indicate that about
$1.75 billion of long-term borrowing was abandoned or postponed beyond
1966 because of high interest rates. This led to an estimated $280
million of contract award cut-backs or deferrals, about one-fifth of
which were not felt until 1967.
The year 1967 brought its own round of borrowing postpone-
ments evidently exceeding the total for 1966. Although we have no
direct sample information, given certain assumptions it appears that
perhaps $2.1 billion worth of long-term borrowing was postponed beyond
1967 for interest cost reasons. If the response pattern was similar
to that of 1966, this implies contract award reductions and postpone-
ments of about $350 million emanating from the 1967 borrowing diffi-
culties. Likewise, reported borrowing postponements in the first four
months of 1968 may have generated thus far about $70 million in contract
award reductions. If these trends continue, about $300 million of
contract award reductions can be expected in 1968.
Three important factors should be considered in appraising
these estimates. First, contract capital spending is not the only
State and local budget item adversely effected. Certain noncontract
work was probably also reduced. Additionally there was a yet undeter-
mined amount of cutbacks and stretch-outs of current outlays to support
unfunded capital projects. Second, contract award reductions will
have delayed impacts on the actual stream of expenditures because of
* Prepared by John Petersen, Economist, Capital Markets Section.
1/ The borrowing survey covered only 1966 and no directly comparable
information is available for 1967 and 1968. Historical ratios
between the survey results and series which are currently available
must therefore be used. To develop the estimates above, it is
assumed that the proportion of total borrowing reductions for the
year to that total reported in the financial press remained the same
as it was in 1966. In 1966, the latter reported $1.074 billion of
borrowing postponements and reductions as compared to our survey
estimate of $1.725 billion caused by interest rate factors alone.
It has also been assumed that the amount of contract award reductions
was the same proportion of total long-term borrowing reductions in
both 1967 and the early part of 1968 as it was in 1966.

the structural lags involved in construction and payment phasing.-
Third, there are numerous multiplier or secondary effects that radiate
from State and local government contract and spending reductions into
other sectors of the economy. These effects require time to cumulate'
and will amount to much more than the primary effects estimated above.
1/ A follow-up survey is underway to get more information on the
lagging and secondary impacts involved in both borrowing and
contract award reductions by State and local governments.

APPENDIX D: FOREIGN BOND ISSUES IN GERMANY
Over the past year or so but more particularly since the
beginning of this year, there has been a substantial growth of foreign
bond issues denominated in German marks (DM) on the German capital
market. In recent months these bonds have generally been issued with
coupons of 7 per cent; by comparison, recent domestic issues have
carried coupons of 6-1/2 per cent. The substantial increase in the
amount of foreign bond issues coming to the German capital market and
the higher rates of interest offered on these issues has created some
concern that these developments might endanger the continued recovery
of the bond market and lead to a new rise in German interest rates.
There has in fact been speculation in the financial press that some
measures would be taken to control the volume of new foreign bond
issues. The Bundesbank addresses itself to this situation in its
April Monthly Report. The Bundesbank concludes that: 1) the greater
foreign demand for capital market financing is not endangering the
capital market because a strong increase in the supply of investment
funds has accompanied the growth of demand for funds; 2) it is therefore
not necessary to reconsider capital market policy with reference to
foreign bond issues; 3) a net outflow of capital from the country is
"natural and desirable" in view of the overall balance of payments
surplus.
Background of the situation. In 1967, Germany exported a
net total of $898 million of long-term capital (private and public);
of this sum, $546 million consisted of total long-term private capital
and $40 million of that, or 4.5 per cent of the grand total, reoresented
German purchases of foreign DM-denominated bonds issued on the German
capital market. Sales to Germans of such bonds were equivalent to only
about 1 per cent of total net sales of bonds of domestic issuers.
What has now given rise to some uneasiness in Germany is the
fact that in the first quarter of 1968 private long-term capital
amounting to $416 million has already been exported, more than three-
fourths of the sum exported during the whole of 1967. Within the first
four months of 1968, foreign DM-denominated bond issues on the German
capital market (sold to foreigners as well as German investors), had
reached the total ($183 million) issued during the course of 1967.
This development is the result of the decline in German interest
rates relative to those prevailing in other major financial centers.
Prior to 1967, the interest rate structure in Germany was one of the
highest of any of the major industrialized countries. The gap which

D -2
existed previously between bond yields on the German and other
capital markets has not only closed but the opposite situation
has arisen and foreign bond yields are now in many instances higher
than German yields. For instance, yields on Euro-dollar bonds 1
and on U.K., Dutch and Canadian government bonds were 7.52, 7.25,
6.45, and 6.64 per cent respectively in the first week of May; the
yield on 6 per cent German public authority bonds was 6.46 per cent
at the same time.
The Bundesbank's analysis. The Bundesbank stresses the
point that capital outflows, per se, are not harmful to the capital
market and are in fact desirable given the German balance of payments
surplus. It is true that the amount of foreign bond issues rose
sharply in the first four months of this year. However, the bond
market actually strengthened since the beginning of the year and in
April yields declined 19 basis points despite a particularly heavy
slate of new foreign bond issues. The market strengthened sufficiently,
in fact, to alloy the Bundesbank to halt the support purchases necessary
in earlier months and to place some of its earlier purchases back into
the market. (The Bundesbank observed, however, that the capital market
was seasonally very liquid in the first quarter and that flotations of
the volume of the first quarter could not be anticipated for following
quarters.)
The decline in domestic bond yields furthermore proves
groundless the fear that the higher yield on foreign bonds would,
itself, force up rates on domestic issues. It is normal that yields
on foreign-issued bonds are higher than those on domestic issues in
the same market. For example, this situation exists presently in the
Netherlands and Switzerland and was the case also in Germany before
1964, when announcement of the 25 per cent coupon tax led to large-
scale selling of German bonds by foreigners and a sharp fall in domestic
bond prices. Some of the money that left German bonds was promptly
reinvested in foreign DM bonds, which were not subject to the coupon
tax. This series of developments led to the unusual situation of
before-tax yields on domestic bonds being higher than those on foreign
bonds through 1965 and 1966. Even after more than a year of rising

German bond prices yields on those securities remained above yields

Foreign bond flotations on the German capital market
Most foreign bond issues floated in Germany have taken
the form of DM-denominated bonds. A few bonds have been denominated
in foreign currency (U.S. dollars or sterling). There have been ho
unit of account bonds issued.
Foreign bonds began to come to the German market in
substantial numbers only in 1964. The growth of foreign issues since
then is apparently the result of various balance of payments measures
taken by the United States beginning with the IET in 1963, and the
announcement of the German coupon tax in March 1964, which led to a
decline in the interest rate on foreign bonds in Germany.
Of the foreign issuers making use of the German capital
market since 1964, Luxembourg (the seat of many international holding
companies), the United States and Japan have been the most important.
(See Table 1.) And since borrowing by Luxembourg probably largely
represents borrowing by subsidiary companies of U.S. parent firms, it
would seem that the United States has been directly and indirectly the
single largest foreign borrower on the German market.
The net burden of foreign bond issues on the German market
Although a significant and growing volume of foreign bonds
have been issued in Germany, they have actually placed a smaller net
burden upon German savings than is indicated by gross flotation figures.
(See Table 2.) Of the total $376 million DM-denominated bonds issued
by foreigners in Germany from 1964 through 1967, only $283 million or
one-third of the total have actually remained in Germany. In fact, in
1967 only one-fourth of total foreign bond issues remained in German
possession.
So far in 1968, however, three-quarters of total foreign
bond sales have remained in Germany. Although it is unlikely that
this entire amount will in fact remain in German hands -- resale of
these securities to foreigners or sale to them of securities remaining

with consortium banks after the official subscription period can
still occur during the remainder of the year -- this development
nonetheless suggests a significant shift in German investor interest.
Given the change in the relative interest levels in Germany and other
capital markets, the Bundesbank believes that German investors will
continue to buy larger portions of foreign bonds issued in Germany
than they did in previous years.
