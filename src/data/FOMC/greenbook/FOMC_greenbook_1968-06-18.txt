of Governors of the Federal Reserve Syst em.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization proce ss which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain. 
 Please note that some material may have b een redacted from this document if that

format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to rem ove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing). 
 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optical character recognition computer program (OCR) 
first created electronic text from the document im age.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, 
staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.  Pl ease note that the numbers and text in charts and

CURRENT ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL CONDITIONS
By the Staff
Board of Governors
of the Federal Reserve SystemJune 12, 1968

I- 1
SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK
Outlook for economic activity
The increase in gross national product in the current quarter
is expected to be somewhat larger than that in the first quarter.
Although the rise in consumption is likely to be large, it appears to
be running well below the first quarter increase. On the other hand,
the rate of inventory accumulation is expected to pick up markedly and
net exports to recover somewhat. In addition, defense expenditures are
expected to maintain their first quarter rate of advance.
The rate of expansion in activity should slow markedly in
the third quarter. Passage of the bill providing for a 10 per cent
surtax and a reduction of $6 billion in Federal expenditures should
have a fairly prompt effect on the economy. Federal spending is
expected to begin decelerating sharply, with the further increase in
outlays almost entirely due to the Federal pay raise for military and
civilian personnel. Housing starts are expected to decline and outlays
for residential construction to drop after midyear, but plans for busi-
ness investment in new plant and equipment suggest a more than offsetting
rise.
Curtailed growth in personal income, reflecting smaller
employment increases, and the increased withholdings expected to become
effective early in July, should result in a marked slowdown in expansion
of disposable income in the third quarter. Although a drop in the rate
of saving is likely to offset some of the impact of this, total

I- 2
consumption expenditures are expected to increase only moderately further in
current dollar terms and at a slow pace in real terms. With consumer
takings of goods growing very little, the inventory accumulation of
consumer goods should be substantially above the current rate, offsetting
anticipated declines in stocks of steel and autos in the next quarter.
The rate of growth of real GNP is expected to drop from
about 6-1/2 per cent in the current quarter to 2 per cent in the third
quarter, largely reflecting curtailed growth in spendable income and
consumption.
Outlook for prices and resource use
The abrupt slowing of expansion in aggregate demand now in
prospect for the third quarter is expected to be accompanied by a
minimal rise in industrial production, an appreciable decline in the
rate of manufacturing capacity utilization, some decrease in manufactur-
ing employment, and a moderate increase in the unemployment rate from
the current low level.
The marked slackening of growth in demand and the accompany-
ing easing of capacity and labor market pressures, however, will be
accompanied by continuing increases in prices. Upward wage pressures
are likely to continue, in part to cover the large increases in consumer
prices over the past year and in part because of upward momentum imparted
by the large wage settlements of recent months. With wages continuing
to rise at a fast pace and with the recent pick up in productivity aborted
by the sharp cutback in output growth, unit labor costs are likely to
show renewed increase.

I-3
Although some "sensitive" prices have declined at wholesale,
average prices of "sluggish" materials and finished products have con-
tinued to rise. The over-all industrial price average will probably
be moving up again this summer--though at a much more moderate pace
than last winter. Consumer prices may be responsive to the expected
slackening in retail demands, although remaining subject to the effects
of continuing upward cost pressures. Absent the Government pay increase,
the GNP deflator is expected to show a slightly smaller rise in the
third quarter than in the second.
Demands for credit
Demands for credit will be fairly heavy in the weeks immed-
iately ahead, but if the tax bill is enacted by late June, as is still
expected by the market, these demands are not likely to force interest
rates higher. In fact, rates may very well show some further declines,
particularly in long-term markets. Of course, if the tax bill should
not be enacted, interest rates would quickly rise to, and undoubtedly
through, the recent May highs.
Near-term increases in credit demands may be most pronounced
in shorter-term markets. The Treasury may need to borrow as much as
$4 billion by early July, presumably mainly through tax bills, while
at the same time business demands for bank credit and for financing in
commercial paper markets may be quite strong. Passage of the tax bill
will occur too late to swell the tax borrowing needs of corporations in
June, but business borrowing to finance inventories or current outlays

I-4
already appears to be on the rise from the reduced May pace. In
addition, corporations will have to make retroactive income tax payments
in July totaling an estimated $1.1 billion--for which little advance
preparation seems to have been made. Consequently, although corporate
income tax payments due in June are relatively small, combined corporate
payments for June and July together are estimated to be just as large
as they were in the like months of 1967.
In long-term markets, demands for mortgage credit appear to
be continuing strong. Moreover, June calendars of new offerings in
both corporate and municipal securities markets seem likely to exceed
those of other months this year. And clarification of the status of
industrial revenue bonds, through the rider attached to the tax bill,
may trigger a substantial additional near-term supply of these issues.
On the other hand, about half of the expected June supply of publicly-
offered corporate bonds has already been brought to market, and thus
far, volume for July promises to be substantially lighter, as is often
the case during the early summer.
Supply of funds
With enactment of the fiscal restraint package, the tendency
evident in very recent days for institutional investors to hold back in
acquiring new aggressively priced corporate bond issues is likely to
dissipate. Other more speculatively inclined investors might also seek
to add to bond positions in anticipation of lower long-term rates later
in the year. But any general expectational change of this type toward

I-5
lower long-term rates would likely not move very far in the absence of
some confirming evidence of an easier monetary policy.
Short-term interest rates may show less immediate response
to the enactment of fiscal legislation, partly because of heavy impend-
ing Treasury credit demands. So long as the present structure of
short-term market rates continues, with 90-day bills around 5.70 per
cent and short-maturity finance company paper at 6 per cent, banks can
be expected to experience a fairly sizable run-off of negotiable CD's
in June, though probably less than the worst fears of banks a few weeks
ago. Following the midyear interest crediting, some further switching
of consumer-type funds to other investment channels is likely to occur,
principally from accounts at large banks. And at nonbank savings
institutions, it seems likely that outflows of savings during the coming
June-July reinvestment period will be at least somewhat larger, on an
unadjusted basis, than at the end of the first quarter, when market
yields on short-term instruments were about 50 basis points under their
current levels and when fewer savings institutions credited dividends.
The public has accumulated a substantial increase in money
holdings over recent months, partly because of the rapid transfers of
deposits from U.S. Government accounts. But cash needs for transaction
purposes have been rising along with the 10 per cent annual rate of
increase in GNP during the first half. In the summer, Government
deposits are not expected to be a significant source of supply for
private deposits, and may at times absorb some such deposits. Downward
readjustments of excess cash balances might also occur, if expectations
were to develop that the trend of interest rates would be downward.

I-6
With inflows of funds to banks and other savings institutions
remaining limited, and given the uncertainties of the dividend-
reinvestment period, the immediate outlook is for continued pressure on
mortgage markets at least through the early weeks of summer. Banks have
reported considerable recent firming of policies on mortgage loans (as
well as other loans), and nonbank institutions remain reluctant lenders.
If a fiscal package is legislated within the next few weeks, a gradual
lessening of pressures in mortgage markets might begin to develop as
yields on long-term market instruments decline and thereby increase the
relative attractiveness of mortgages to large, diversified institutional
lenders. However, a more pronounced easing of mortgage market conditions
would appear to depend on a sustained and sizable net increase in flows
of savings to thrift institutions.

I- 7
Balance of Payments
The liabilities of U.S. banks to their foreign branches
increased by more than $1 billion (20 per cent) during May, bringing
the total increase since December to more than $2 billion. The recent
heavy inflow of foreign liquid funds apparently reflected both an
increasing demand for funds by U.S. banks and an abnormal swelling of
the supply of such funds as a result of confidence movements out of
sterling and French francs.
The inflow temporarily swung the over-all payments balance
on the official settlements basis into surplus in May, and perhaps
also for the second quarter as a whole, even after adjustment for
favorable seasonal factors. But, as on similar occasions in 1966 and
1967, the inflow may be expected to subside fairly soon, and the
official settlements balance to revert to deficit. In addition, strong
adverse seasonal influences will make themselves felt during the third
quarter. Hence, the U.S. reserve position is likely to come under
renewed pressure. Given the growing reluctance of leading foreign
central banks to add to their uncovered dollar holdings, there are
likely to be further gold losses and requests for the Federal Reserve
to provide exchange guarantees through use of swaps.
The deficit on the liquidity basis before special official
transactions diminished sharply in May, but for April-May together
it was at a higher rate than during the first quarter. No early
lasting improvement is in prospect, since an expected increase in the

I-8
merchandise trade surplus is likely to be offset by increased net
outflows of U.S. private capital, which were unusually small in the
months immediately following the January 1 announcement of the new
restraint programs.

THE ECONOMIC PICTURE IN DETAIL
The Nonfinancial Scene
Gross national product. Passage of the fiscal package--
still anticipated before the end of this month--would slow sharply the
growth of over-all output in the third quarter. The rise in GNP is
expected to be cut almost in half, from an estimated annual rate of
$22 billion this quarter to about $12 billion in July-September. The
expected rate of real GNP growth would drop sharply from about 6-1/2
per cent annually in the second quarter to 2 per cent in the third
quarter. This reduced rate of growth is not likely to have an
appreciable effect on wage gains and other costs in the next few
months, and prices in the private economy are expected to rise almost
as rapidly in the third quarter as in the second. The GNP deflator
should show no slackening in growth owing to the Federal workers' pay
raise, due July 1, which is treated in the accounts as a price increase.
An abrupt third quarter slowdown would follow several quarters
of accelerating expansion with mounting pressure on labor resources and
wage rates. While data for the second quarter are incomplete, the
rise in current dollar GNP for the quarter now seems likely to exceed
the $19.5 billion gain of the first quarter by $2 to $3 billion,
annual rate. This estimate is slightly below our original forecast for
the second quarter, due largely to a smaller growth in nondurable goods
consumption--up $4 instead of $6 billion--but some of the shortfall is
likely to be reflected in a larger accumulation of inventories. In

I -2
real terms the second quarter rise in GNP is expected to exceed that
of any quarter since early 1966.
The impact of the surtax on disposable income and consump-
tion is expected to be prompt. Other recent sources of expansion
will also be curtailed. Although Federal spending in the third
quarter will be increased by the Federal pay raise, other outlays,
especially defense, are expected to level off. Moreover, residential
construction is expected to drop moderately and business inventory
accumulation to level off. Business investment in fixed capital is
expected to more than offset the reduction in residential outlays
according to the recent official survey of business plans for new
plant and equipment expenditures.
Personal income is likely to expand considerably less than
the extraordinary increases in the first and second quarters of this
year, as employment growth slows. In addition, about $6.7 billion
(annual rate) of the increase in pretax income will be offset by the
anticipated increase in the surtax early in July. As a result, total
spendable income will rise at a rate of only about $4 billion during
the quarter--less than one third the increase of the preceding quarter.
A drop in the saving rate to 6.5 per cent from the high
7.2 per cent rate projected for the second quarter will help sustain
consumer spending in the third quarter in the face of the tax in-
crease. Although the saving rate could dip further, a drop of this
magnitude appears generally consistent with the small cut in auto
sales and the projected level of other durable goods expenditures.

II -3
With saving dropping moderately, the rise in consumer expendi-
ture is expected to be reduced only from $10.5 billion in the second
quarter to $8 billion in the third quarter. Unit sales of new domes-
tic automobiles are expected to dip about 100,000 below the 8.5
million annual rate projected for the current quarter. Furniture
and appliances sales are expected to continue to rise along with home
completions, although at a somewhat more moderate rate. Nondurable
goods outlays are expected to rise at a normal rate of about 6 per
cent from the second quarter--far below the rate of increase in the
first half of this year. The upward trend in outlays for services is
assumed to be relatively unaffected by the tax rise.
The rather sudden slowing in the upswing in consumer
purchases may leave distributors and producers with heavier stocks
than anticipated. On the other hand, stocks of auto dealers which
have been rising more than seasonally may decline in July-September
and steel inventories are likely to be drawn down beginning in August.
Reductions in stocks in these industries should offset in part a
possible rise in inventories of other goods, and result in a net
increase in business stocks at a rate about as fast as is now pro-
jected for the second quarter.
Housing starts are expacted to turn down before the end of
this quarter as recent developments in financial markets begin to
take their toll, and to dip to 1.33 million annual rate in the third

II -4
quarter. This compares with a rate of close to 1.5 million in
January-June, and would be the lowest rate in over a year. Outlays
for new housing should fall less sharply than starts, from a rate of
$29 billion to about $28 billion.
Business investment in plant and equipment will rise
moderately in the third quarter, according to a recent Commerce-SEC
survey. The new survey confirms the previous estimate that second
quarter spending for plant and equipment would be slightly below that
in the first. This is not inconsistent with the small rise in
business fixed investment shown in the projections for the second
quarter, since the latter reflect rising construction outlays of
nonprofit institutions, and expanding business purchases of autos
and trucks, which are not fully covered in the Commerce-SEC survey.
The bulge in Federal spending is projected to taper off
sharply in the third quarter. Defense outlays are projected to rise
only $1.5 billion, compared to $25. billion in each of this first two
quarters. Moreover, about $1 billion of the rise reflects the pay in-
crease for military and civilian defense workers. Nondefense pur-
chases in the third quarter also reflect the pay increase.
Since much of the increase in GNP in the third quarter con-
sists of a rise in consumer services or in government wages, industrial
production is expected to show little further rise, and the rate of
capacity utilization should decline appreciably. With a lower rate of
output growth; productivity gains may slow, leading to a somewhat more

II -5
rapid increase in unit labor costs, and corporate profits after adjust-
ment for inventory valuation may edge down slightly.
The rise in personal withholding taxes as a result of the
passage of the surtax in conjunction with a slower growth of Federal
expenditures should cause the Federal deficit (NIA basis) to contract
from the estimated second quarter rate of $10.3 billion to $4.8
billion in the third quarter. The decline would have been even
sharper were it not for the fact that the retroactive increase in the
corporate surtax is reflected in the second quarter receipts.

Industrial production. Industrial production, based on
revised March and April figures and available May data, is now estimated
to show a decline from March to April of about one-half point followed
by an increase of slightly over one point in May. At the currently
estimated May level of 163.7, the total index is 5 per cent above May
and June a year ago, the low for 1967.
Auto assemblies rose 10 per cent from the somewhat reduced
April level and were at an annual rate of 9.4 million units. Output
schedules for June are set at about the same rate. Production of
television sets was unchanged in May but two producers have announced
cutbacks in June output of color TV as sales failed to reach anticipated
volume. Output of industrial and commercial equipment declined further,
but production of trucks rose to record levels.
Among industrial materials, steel production rose further,
output of automotive parts increased, and output of copper continued to
recover from reduced strike levels. However, strikes curtailed output
in the metal working and chemical industries.
Capacity utilization. The May rate of manufacturing capacity
utilization is expected to be about 84 per cent, up slightly from April.
The operating rate has remained in a very narrow range since last summer
at about this level.
Most manufacturing industries have considerable unused
physical capacity. The steel and aircraft industries, where operating
rates are far above normal, are exceptions. Also, only moderate amounts

II -9
of unused capacity are available for the production of most textile,
petroleum, and rubber products.

Retail sales. According to the advance Commerce report, the
value of retail sales in May rose 1.1 per cent from an April level
which had been adversely affected by civil disturbances in a number of
cities. The May rise brought the average for the first two months of
the second quarter 0.7 per cent above the first quarter. Sales in the
first quarter already had increased a substantial 4.6 per cent above
the relatively weak fourth quarter. May sales were nearly 8 per cent
above a year earlier.
Sales at durable goods stores, which had the largest percent-
age dip in April, increased 1.6 per cent in May. Nondurable goods
sales were up slightly less than 1 per cent. All major types of durable
goods stores reported increases; sales at the various major types of
nondurable goods stores were up slightly or unchanged.

Unit auto sales and stocks. Dealer deliveries of new
domestic autos rose in the final 10 days of May and for the month were
at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 8.7 million units, one-tenth
above April and also a year earlier. Reduced sales in April apparently
reflected in part civil disorders.
For the first 5 months of the year, domestic sales have been
at an average annual rate of 8.2 million units, compared with 7.5
million in the corresponding months of 1967. Seasonally adjusted stocks
of new cars increased somewhat further during May to a total of 1.5
million cars, a number 15 per cent above a year earlier. However, the
seasonally adjusted stock of new cars dropped somewhat in May to about
51 days' supply about the level in January.---

II -11
Sales of new imported cars in May continued exceptionally
strong and were one-fourth above a year earlier. In the first 5 months
sales of imported cars have been at an annual rate of about 900,000
units and have accounted for one-tenth of the total new car market as
compared with about 8 per cent last year.

Consumer instalment credit. Final figures for April show
that consumers slowed their borrowing in that month while maintaining
their repayments on existing instalment debt. The result was a slightly
smaller rise in outstanding instalment credit than in either of the two
preceding months. For both February and March, the annual rate of
increase was $6.8 billion, while for April it was $6.5 billion.
The main area of reduced borrowing was autos, and this in
turn was largely a reflection of the drop in auto sales. Credit inten-
sity in auto purchases--i.e., the ratio of dollars borrowed to dollars
spent--actually increased a little in April. Personal and home

II -12
improvement loans were also off from the March volume, but extensions
of credit for home goods and apparel continued to rise.
The April slowdown in credit expansion presumably was
temporary, with auto sales rebounding sharply in May. For the second
quarter as a whole, we are estimating an annual rate of expansion of
about $7.0 billion. This would be less than the $8 billion increase
for all of 1965, but still the highest quarterly rate in more than
2 years.

Meanwhile, delinquency rates on consumer loans have taken a
turn for the better. Since mid-1967, in fact, delinquency rates at
banks have been running below year-earlier levels. And data for sales
finance companies and credit unions reveal much the same pattern of
improvement.

II -13
Consumer lending standards still show relatively few signs
of tightening. Downpayment requirements on used cars have become some-
what more restrictive in recent months, but that is about the only
significant change that has taken place in auto terms. There have been
announcements of increases in consumer lending rates--particularly on
auto loans where a differential still exists between current rates and
usury limits--but these have been scattered. Some lenders--the small
loan companies especially--are already charging the legal maximum and
therefore are unable to raise rates.
The last increase in the prime rate did trigger increases by
a number of banks and sales finance companies in rates charged on
floorplan loans. But these wholesale rates typically respond more
rapidly to changes in general market rates of interest than do consumer
rates.
Business inventories. The rate of inventory accumulation
increased sharply in April after declining substantially during the
first quarter. The book value of inventories held by manufacturing and
trade concerns increased $1.3 billion in April as compared with a little
over $200 million in March and a first quarter monthly average of $370
million. Accelerated inventory gains were widespread in April among
both manufacturing and trade lines.
Both the abrupt step-up in stock-building in April and the
runoff in the rate of accumulation in the first quarter were apparently
in part involuntary--particularly in trade. Retail sales dropped

II -14
substantially in April, following an unusually sharp run-up from
December to March. Manufacturers' sales declined moderately in April
and were little changed from their first quarter average, whereas manu-
facturers anticipate a sales increase of 2 per cent for the second
quarter as a whole. But the rise in inventories of manufacturers in
April (a book value increase of over $700 million, as compared with a
monthly average of $265 million in the first quarter) was in line with
their anticipated increase for the second quarter ($2.1 billion).
As a result of the sharp rise in inventories and the decline
in sales, stock-sales ratios increased in April for both manufacturers
and distributors. Their combined average ratio, at 1.53, was up from
1.50 in March and unchanged from December 1967; at this level it was
still well below the high of 1.58 a year earlier.
Conspicuous features of the business inventory change in
April were renewed sizable inventory accumulation in equipment industries
(particularly "defense") and a sharp step-up in the rate of accumulation
of auto stocks at the retail level.

Construction and real estate. New construction put in
place, which had edged off in March and April, turned upward to a new
high in May. About half the year-to-year increase in May reflected
rising construction costs. Residential construction expenditures--a
major force in the May advance--continued to rise for the 17th consecu-
tive month. Private nonresidential construction expenditures apparently
changed little after a further drop in April to a low for the year.
Public construction expenditures moved higher in May, although at a
level still under the peak in February of 1967.

recent month (May) are available under a confidential arrangement

reference be made to them.
A factor in the slower pace of private nonresidential
construction in recent months has been the sharply reduced rate of
industrial construction activity. Such construction reached a 2-1/2
year low in April, the latest month for which data are available.
Moreover, commercial and most other types of private nonresidential

II -17
construction, which had accelerated to new highs early this year, also
declined further in April.
For residential structures, vacancy rates have remained
unusually low and, unlike 1966, demands for both new and used residen-
tial units this spring have generally been maintained in the face of
both rising prices and higher interest rates. For example, sales of
existing homes in April were 14 per cent above a year earlier, and the
average price of homes sold was up 5 per cent, a somewhat larger rise
from a year ago in such prices than earlier this year. Under these
circumstances and with mortgage commitments outstanding still relatively
large, the momentum of new residential activity has continued upward
thus far, bolstered in part by the 1.62 million seasonally adjusted
annual rate of housing starts reported for April. While an appreciable
reduction from the exceptionally high April rate of starts is expected
over the period ahead, starts for the second quarter as a whole will
most likely hold near the advanced 1.5 million rate of the first quarter.
Plant and equipment expenditures. Business plans for fixed
capital expenditures this year have been revised up slightly from plans
of three months ago, according to the Commerce-SEC survey conducted in
late April and May. Expenditures now planned for this year total $65.8
billion, 6.7 per cent more than in 1967. The preceding official survey,
taken in late January and February, had indicated a rise of 5.8 per cent.
The pattern of planned expenditures over the year is basically the same
as three months earlier--a slight dip in the second quarter followed by

II -18
a moderate rise in the second half. In 1967 fixed capital spending
rose only 1.7 per cent, following increases of 15 per cent or more in
1964, 1965, and 1966.
The somewhat larger rise in the total now indicated for 1968
is attributable to a large upward revision in plans of nonmanufacturing
industries--which now indicate an increase of more than 9.0 per cent
rather than the 6.7 per cent indicated before. Much of this upward
revision is concentrated in the first quarter.
Manufacturers now plan to increase outlays this year only
3.5 per cent, instead of the 4.6 per cent indicated by the January-
February survey, with the downward revision entirely in nondurable
industries. Actual spending in the first quarter was nearly 6 per cent
below that being planned about midway through the quarter. Outlays
planned by both the durable and nondurable goods sectors are now
expected to rise further in the last half of the year. The January-
February survey had shown a small decline.

Capital appropriations. Manufacturers' newly approved
capital appropriations declined 4.2 per cent further in the first
quarter of this year, according to the recent National Industrial
Conference Board's survey of the 1,000 largest manufacturing companies.
Newly approved appropriations of durable goods producers, however, were
up 4.4 per cent from the final quarter of last year. A sharp decline
in capital set-asides in the petroleum industry resulted in lower
appropriations for nondurable manufacturers; new appropriations of
nondurable goods producers other than petroleum were up 5 per cent from
the fourth quarter of 1967. The backlog of unspent appropriations of
all manufacturers, and of durable goods producers, were worked down
further in the first quarter as expenditures remained high or increased.
But at nondurable goods producers, backlogs rose somewhat further.
Despite the decline for all manufacturing, and for durable goods pro-
ducers, appropriations unspent at the end of the quarter were sufficient
to support recent high spending rates through the balance of the year.
Manufacturers now expect their capital appropriations to
turn up in the current quarter with the rise continuing during the last
half of the year.
Labor market. The labor market continues tight. The
unemployment rate in May remained at 3.5 per cent, its lowest point
since late 1953. Virtually fractional rates of unemployment for married
men (1.6 per cent) and adult men (2.1 per cent) reflected the continued
strong demand for manpower. Insured unemployment through the end of
May remained well below year-earlier levels.

II -21
Nonfarm payroll employment failed to increase last month,
but in the absence of increased strike activity--60,000 telephone and
nearly 30,000 construction workers--total employment would have risen
by about 100,000. Manufacturing employment was unchanged, though the
workweek did rebound from the depressed April level. There were no
significant employment gains or losses among the individual manufactur-
ing industries and, for the most part, the workweek increases paralleled
the March-April declines. The second quarter increase in manufacturing
employment now appears likely to be nearer 100,000 than our initially
projected 200,000, suggesting a continued rapid rise in productivity.
In the nonindustrial sectors, employment gains continued
strong in State and local government, services, and trade. These three
large industry groups continue as a major source of manpower demand and
accounted for 72 per cent of the employment increase from a year ago.
In total, nonfarm payroll employment increased by 2.1 million over the
last year.
Earnings. Hourly earnings in manufacturing rose in May to
$2.98, 6 per cent higher than a year earlier. There were large increases
in primary metals (7.0 per cent), where overtime work is up sharply from
a year earlier, and in transportation equipment (6.5 per cent), where
the rise reflects higher wage rates under the auto contracts. Increases
in earnings also continued large in the nonmanufacturing industries.
With wages still rising faster than productivity, further increases in
unit labor costs can be expected.

II -22

Contract construction $4.32 6.9
Wholesale and retail trade 2.38 6.7
Manufacturing 2.98 6.0
Finance, insurance, and real estate 2.72 5.8
Labor force. Labor demand continues to be met by sizable
labor force increases among adults, with relatively few additional
teenage workers entering the labor market. The continued inflow of
adults (20 and over)--which has contributed substantially to the supply
of labor resources--is an outgrowth of the post-war baby boom, which
should continue to provide a large flow of adult workers over the next
few years.
The over-all unemployment rate will likely average 3.5 per
cent in the second quarter, its lowest quarterly average in 15 years.
A year ago the rate was 3.7 per cent. With the tax increase assumed
to cut aggregate demand after midyear, however, the demand for labor is
also expected to slow and the unemployment rate is expected to rise to
an average 3.7 per cent in the third quarter. Employers will likely
curtail their hiring and new entrants into the labor force will probably
bear the brunt of any third quarter rise in unemployment. In manufactur-
ing, the immediate adjustment in output would likely be made by reduction
in hours of work with only a modest number of layoffs initially.

II -23
New benchmark revisions. The payroll employment, hours, and
earnings data discussed above reflect the annual BLS adjustment to
benchmark data (March 1967) and the introduction of revised seasonal
factors. The total nonfarm payroll employment estimate for the first
quarter of 1968 was revised down by 116,000, reflecting reductions in
trade, construction, and services. Partly offsetting these was an
upward revision of 94,000 in manufacturing, entirely in durables. Hours
and earnings figures were not significantly changed.

Industrial relations. Partial contract settlements were
reached May 31 by the major aluminum producers (Alcoa, Kaiser, and
Reynolds). About 17,000 members of the steel workers union and 6,000
members of the auto workers union agreed to the settlement. Members
of the aluminum workers union refused to accept the package agreed to
by the other unions and about 16,000 workers are still out at Alcoa
and Reynolds plants.

II -24
The 3-year agreement which the steel workers negotiated with
the major aluminum companies foreshadows a possible basis for settle-
ment in upcoming steel bargaining. It provides for a total package
estimated at 97 cents, including "roll-up" costs. (The "roll-up" is
the estimated secondary effect of the rise in base pay on overtime and
on shift differentials.) This works out at an annual average rate of
increase in hourly compensation, including fringes, of 6.7 per cent
(compounded), using as a base the pre-settlement average figure of
$4.50. This compares with an estimated annual package increase of 6.1
per cent negotiated by the steel workers with the can companies in
February and the 5.8 to 6.6 per cent increases won by the auto workers
last fall.
Large wage increases as well as substantial improvements in
fringe benefits were provided by the aluminum contract. "Front-
loading"--a substantially larger increase in wages in the first than
subsequent years of the contract--characterized the aluminum contract
to an even greater degree than other recent settlements. The first
year increase in hourly earnings averages 30.9 cents, or 10 per cent.
The emphasis on first-year wage increases in these contracts in part
reflects the workers' desire to "catch-up" with the sharp upward trend
in living costs. The aluminum and can contracts have no provision for
adjusting wages to future increases in consumer prices. However, the
auto contract provides for two upward adjustments, each limited to a
maximum of 8 cents and a minimum of 3 cents at the beginning of the
second and third contract years.

Wholesale prices. Average prices of industrial commodities
declined 0.2 per cent in May to 108.6 per cent of the 1957-59 average,
according to the BLS preliminary estimate. The decline for industrial
commodities was more than offset by a pronounced spurt in prices of
foods and foodstuffs (owing in the main to large increases for fruits
and vegetables because of short supplies), and the total wholesale price
index edged up another 0.1 per cent to an estimated 108.4.
These preliminary estimates are subject to revision when
complete reports are in. The May pricing date (May 14) was unusually
late in the month and, to meet their release date, the BLS "closed out"

II -26
their preliminary WPI estimate with a smaller sample of reports than
usual. During the past 8 months, the estimate of the industrial
commodity total has been revised upward 0.1 per cent in 5 months and
has been confirmed in the other 3 months (including March and April).
Revisions of the foods and foodstuff indexes have been a little larger.
The decline for industrial commodities in May (the first
since June 1964) followed a marked slowing in April of the earlier
rapid advance. Both the smaller rise in April and the May decline
primarily reflected sharp price cuts following settlement of the copper
strike: reversal of the earlier large run-up in prices of copper scrap
and imported ingots began in April, and in May prices of brass and wire
mill products were also cut sharply and lead prices were reduced.
Declines for these nonferrous metals, coupled with further
decreases for steel scrap, led to an 0.5 per cent decline in the special
FR index of sensitive industrial material prices in April and an esti-
mated further decrease of close to 2 per cent in May. The decline
accelerated in May, in part because the average decrease for nonferrous
metals was much larger and in part because the earlier sharp rise in
lumber and plywood prices finally slowed. In early June, prices of
brass and wire mill products were reduced substantially further and
steel scrap continued to decline, but prices of aluminum ingot and mill
shapes were raised. Thus, the decline in average prices of sensitive
industrial materials has probably slowed considerably since the May
pricing date.

II -27
Average prices of all industrial commodities other than
sensitive materials continued to rise in May, although at a slower pace
than in April when the rise was close to the average for the preceding
5 months. According to the preliminary BLS estimates, the number of
product classes showing increases dropped considerably in May and prices
increased more slowly for both machinery and equipment and furniture and
household durables.

Consumer prices. The consumer price index rose 0.3 per cent
in April to 119.9 per cent of the 1957-59 average. This rise was less
than in March but it equaled the average increase over the past 6 months
and also over the past year. The April CPI was 4 per cent above April
1967.
The most striking advances in April were in foods and
apparel. Food prices showed a sizable contraseasonal rise reflecting
in the main increases for fruits and vegetables, in response to dwindling

II -28
supplies and delayed marketings of early spring crops, and for dairy
products because of the recent boost in milk support prices. Prices
of livestock products generally, including dairy products, will probably
continue to move up.
The April rise in retail apparel prices, reflecting intro-
duction of new spring lines at higher prices, was considerably larger
than expected seasonally and brought the rise over the year to 5.1 per
cent as compared with an increase at wholesale of 3.3 per cent. Upward
cost and demand pressures have apparently been stronger at the retail
level.
Apart from food and apparel, average prices of other nondur-
able goods in April were unchanged although some rise is normally
expected seasonally. Gasoline prices declined contraseasonally.
Average prices of durable goods showed a moderate further increase,
with prices somewhat higher for appliances, furniture, and used cars;
new car prices, however, declined in April as sales incentive programs
for some makes led to larger discounts than usual.
The rise in service costs slowed appreciably--and probably
temporarily--in April. Prices of all major types of services increased
although gains for the month were generally smaller than in other recent
months. Higher costs of home repairs were apparently a major factor in
the April rise for services.

II -29
Farm real estate values. Prices of farmland increased over
6 per cent in the year ending March 1, 1968. Except for a slight dip
in 1954 and a plateau in 1960, the price of farm land has risen in
each year since 1950. The average annual rate of rise during the 18
years has been 5.5 per cent.
A moderate slowdown in values in the past two years has been
associated with declining prices of farm commodities, particularly
crops, and rising production costs which have reduced the parity ratio
from a high of 82 per cent in February 1966 to an average of 73 per
cent from March 1967 to date.

As shown in the table, the national indexes of land values
conceal divergent trends among the farm regions which reflect differ-
ences with respect to income prospects, demand for land for farm
enlargement, and capitalization of farm program benefits into the value
of the land. Other factors varying in influence from area to area are
demand for land for nonfarm uses such as rural residences, availability
and cost of credit, and investment in land for expected long-term appre-
ciation in value.
The March 1967 survey of the characteristics of the land
market, the most recent available, showed that two-thirds of the buyers
of farm land in 1966-67 were active farmers but this percentage varied
markedly by production areas. Only 44 per cent of the buyers in the
heavily urbanized Northeast (mainly dairying) were active farmers
compared with 82 per cent in the Northern Plains (wheat and feed grains).
Farm expansion was the major reason for buying by active farmers but
here again regional variations were great. Purchases of add-on units
as a per cent of all transfers ranged from 24 per cent in the Northeast
to 65 per cent in the Corn Belt and 75 per cent in the wheat areas.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL SITUATION
Bank credit. Following rapid expansion in April, associated
primarily with business loan growth, loans and investments at all
commercial banks increased at a more moderate 5.8 per cent annual rate
in May, somewhat below the rate of growth in the first quarter./
An increase in Government security holdings by banks accounted for a
large part of the May credit expansion, as business loan growth dropped
back from the rapid April pace.

1/ There was a very much smaller increase in bank credit in the course
of the two-month period when measured on a daily average basis by the
member bank credit proxy. After adjustment to include the sharp in-
crease in Euro-dollar borrowings by U.S. banks, the proxy rose only at
a 0.6 per cent annual rate, on average, during April and May. The
difference between the two series, aside from the growth in credit at
non-member banks (not included in the proxy), represents in part
problems of timing and seasonal adjustment. Over the somewhat longer
period from February, the series are much closer, with the proxy
(adjusted to include Euro-dollar borrowing) expanding at a 2.0 per
cent annual rate and the end-of-month series at a 3.7 per cent rate.
2/ All May rates are preliminary estimates based on incomplete data
and are subject to revision.

III -2
Holdings of Government securities rose approximately $1.5 billion
at all commercial banks during May, largely reflecting acquisitions
during the mid-month Treasury financing. In the two weeks following
the financing, large banks liquidated almost $430 million in Treasury
bills as well as many of the 15-month notes they had acquired in the
financing. With tight reserve positions and weak deposit inflows, banks
have sharply reduced their bill holdings to meet loan demands during
the last few months--from a level of $6 billion at the end of January
to $2.6 billion at the end of May.
Banks also have cut back sharply on their acquisitions of
municipals and other securities for the same reasons. These holdings,
after declining in April, showed only a small rise in May. Over the
two months combined, there was no net increase in bank holdings of
these securities, compared with a 14 per cent annual rate of growth
in the first quarter. While large banks added about $600 million to
their longer-term municipals since end of March, they reduced their
short-term municipals by about an equal amount, with most of this
reduction occurring at banks in New York City.
Despite the continued rapid expansion in general economic
activity, business loan growth in May slackened from the rapid
April pace. This slowdown was evident among most industry categories
and may have reflected a temporary decline in corporate needs for
short-term financing, or switching of some borrowing to the commercial
paper market following the increase in the prime rate late in April.

III -3
To a minor extent, it may also have reflected recent firming in
lending policies at banks as reported in the May Lending Practices
Survey (See Appendix A). However, the large rise in business loans
at New York City banks during the first week in June suggests that
demand factors were primarily responsible for the May slowdown.
This increase was heavily concentrated in durable goods manufacturing,
and probably was associated with inventory accumulation in steel
using industries.
While the expansion of total business loans slowed in May,
term loans at large banks continued the strong growth trend evident
in these loans since the first of the year. Moreover, the recent
expansion has been more widespread among industry categories than in
past months, when it centered mostly in primary metal producers and mining.
Real estate loans at all commercial banks expanded at a
slightly lower rate in May than has prevailed since autumn, possibly
reflecting firmer bank lending policies on these loans as reported
in the May Lending Practices Survey. No appreciable firming, however,
was reported for consumer loans, and growth in these loans appears
to have been fairly rapid in May as automobile sales strengthened.
Bank deposits. Time and savings deposits at all commercial
banks are estimated to have increased at about a 2.0 per cent annual
rate in May, on a daily average basis, approximately the April pace.
However, there was some improvement in net inflows of these deposits
after mid-month, reflecting not only the cessation of the decline
in CD's outstanding, but also somewhat increased inflows of consumer-
type time and savings deposits.

Although outstanding CD's at large banks declined more than
$250 million in May, most of this reduction took place in the first
half of the month. As prospects for the passage of the proposed tax
legislation improved, by May 24 Treasury bill rates had fallen below
Regulation Q ceilings on 3-month maturities and over, and may have
made CD's somewhat more competitive. While CD's outstanding at
large banks showed no change in the aggregate during the last half of
May, banks outside of New York City actually increased their

III -5
outstandings by about $100 million after mid-month, while banks in
New York City lost a similar amount during that period.
After declining in April, consumer-type time and savings
deposits at large banks rose by almost $480 million in May. Savings
deposits grew about $50 million, in contrast to the $580 million
decline in April following the interest crediting period, Banks in
New York and Chicago, where depositors are relatively interest-
sensitive, accounted for little of this increase, however, with gains
in time certificates and open accounts at these banks being nearly
offset by losses in savings deposits. Time and savings deposits at
country banks continued to expand at about the reduced pace prevailing
since the end of March.
With reduced deposit inflows, and in spite of more moderate
loan demand, banks relied heavily on the Euro-dollar market as a
source of funds in May, probably partly in anticipation of the tax-
related bulge in June loan demand. Bank liabilities to foreign
branches increased more than $800 million, on a last Wednesday of
the month basis, the largest expansion for any month to date.
With continued large reductions in U.S. Government deposits,
the money stock, on a daily average basis, is estimated to have
expanded at over a 10 per cent annual rate in May, following an 8.5
per cent increase in April. Since the end of February, the increase
in the demand deposit component of the money stock has approximated
the decline in U.S. Government demand deposits, indicating that
businesses and individuals are in effect holding the increased deposits

being transferred out of the Government account rather than switching
into earning assets as rising interest rates would seem to warrant.
While this might be explained to some extent by increased transactions
demand associated with the expanding level of economic activity, it
would also seem that uncertainty, related to the gold crisis in March
and more recently to the prospects for a tax increase, the future
course of monetary policy and interest rates, has been an important
contributing factor.
Nonbank Depositary Institutions. Preliminary data indicate
that inflows to mutual savings banks in May accelerated to a surprisingly
large 8.9 per cent seasonally adjusted annual rate--the most rapid
growth in deposits since last July. Accompanying this inflow, however,
was the largest increase in passbook loans for any month on record for
the New York State mutuals. This high rate of passbook loan growth
was maintained in early June at the 15 largest savings banks in New
York City.

The conflicting trends of both large deposit inflows and a
rapid increase in passbook loans are extremly difficult to interpret.
The May statistic, however, is preliminary (and confidential until
June 14) and may be revised downward. In addition, while the seasonal
adjustment factors were recently revised, it is also possible that a
shifting seasonal pattern may have biased upward the May results. For
April and May combined, however, the seasonally adjusted annual rate
of 6.9 per cent is only marginally below the first quarter pace, when
market yields were considerably lower.
Although no information is yet available for the May savings
and loan experience, the staff hopes to have a preliminary indication
in time for the supplement. Scattered information for early May
suggests that the associations may also have had improved inflows
during the months, although probably less marked than at savings banks.
The FHLBB recently announced its preparedness to lower its
present "liquidity reserve" requirement1 /in the event of large outflows
during the forthcoming reinvestment period. Any change would be
designed to permit S&Ls to maintain, rather than expand their recent
rate of, mortgage lending. During May, member association net borrowing
from the FHLBB increased by $174 million, a more than seasonal increase
and a relatively large volume for the month, comparable to that in the
same period in 1966. San Francisco District S&Ls accounted for about
two-fifths of the May borrowing. Since S&Ls are discouraged from

III -8
borrowing in anticipation of withdrawals, this increase in advances
is presumably designed to support takedowns of existing mortgage
commitments in light of the April savings experience. Rates charged
on FHLBB advances have been increased, however; by July, nearly all
district banks will charge 6 percent on such loans, in contrast to
5.75 per cent now generally prevailing.
Rate adjustments by mutual savings banks announced as of
April 30 involved an increase in average offering rates on regular
accounts and a continuation of the trend toward account differentiation.
Since January, the number of FDIC-insured savings banks offering
maximum rates has increased, as had the number offering bonus, install-
ment, and special notice types of accounts--also at maximum rates.
Of particular note, the number of non-FDIC-insured Massachusetts
savings banks offering more than 5 per cent on special accounts
increased from five in January to eleven as of April 30, at which
2/time one bank was even offering 5.25 per cent on regular accounts.
In New York State, where legal constraints have effectivelly
prevented account differentiation by thrift institutions, new legis-
lation just passed now permits such institutions to establish
special accounts, subject to rate ceilings imposed by the FDIC
and FHLBB.
1/ This requirement presently calls for holdings of cash and Governments
equivalent to a minimum of 7 per cent of savings capital.
2/ The current FDIC rate ceiling, regardless of account type, is 5 per
cent.

III -9
Mortgage market developments. Reflecting increasing uncertainty
among thrift institutions about savings flows through the forthcoming
end-of-June dividend reinvestment period, the residential mortgage
market apparently remained fairly tight through early June. The
weekly FNMA commitment auctions imply that yields on FHA and VA
home mortgages accelerated abruptly in May and rose even higher by
June 10. Although the official, broad-based FHA home mortgage yield
series has not yet become available for May, it seems likely that the
gross yield spread of FHA mortgages over new issues of high-grade corporate
bonds, which had remained exceptionally narrow since last fall,
recovered substantially.
During May, availability of home mortgage funds remained
limited in many major metropolitan areas, judging from FNMA field
reports and other sources. These reports suggest that demands for
home mortgage credit, in contrast, generally continued strong at this
active season of the year, despite record yields required by lenders
and exceptionally large downpayments associated with conventional first
mortgages. Demands for multifamily mortgage credit--under terms
which may be negotiated more flexibly than those on home loans--also
are indicated to have remained strong.
With yields on all types of home mortgages rising above 7 per
cent during the second quarter, several additional States have raised
their below-market 6 per cent usury ceilings. Enactment of legisla-
tion in Pennsylvania (May 17), Delaware (May 28), New York (June 3),
and New Jersey (June 6), has helped to remove a barrier to mortgage

III -10
investment in these States under current market conditions. However,
resolution of lender uncertainty about effective usury ceilings in
New York and New Jersey still awaits action by the State Banking
Commissioners.
In addition to these two States, there are now nine States
where ceilings of 7 per cent or lower are becoming increasingly
restrictive. Last year, these nine States accounted for a sixth of
all housing units for which building permits were issued.
Corporate and municipal bond markets. Yields on new issues
of corporate and municipal bonds have declined fairly substantially
since late in May, in response to an improved outlook for passage of
the fiscal package. The yield decline of about 20 basis points has
largely erased the sharp run-up in yields that followed the May 15
announcement of a delay in consideration of the tax bill. Most
recently, investors appear to have resisted underwriter attempts--
through aggressive pricing--to push the yields on utility issues down
further, although several large industrial offerings have been distribu-
ted rapidly. Moreover, the extremely high new issue volume in both
markets as well as offerings of competing instruments--such as the
Ex-Im PC's and the $100 million Canadian government issues--have
acted in early June to restraint the extent of the decline in yields.
Reflecting the high new issue volume--and some congestion--a few
recent new issues contained delayed delivery provisions, last seen
in volume during the summer of 1967.

Public offerings of corporate bonds in May exceeded $1.0
billion, the heaviest for any month so far this year. The May volume
would have been substantially larger but for the indefinite postponement
of several issues aggregating $185 million and the rescheduling of a
$100 million issue to early June. Total bond and stock offerings in
May aggregated $2.0 billion, including private placements, significantly
above the first quarter pace.-- --

III -12
Corporate security offerings in June will exceed the rapid
May pace. Public bond issues are estimated at $1.4 billion, with about
one-half of this already marketed in the first week of June. Taking
privately placed bonds and stock issues into account, the aggregate
volume of corporate issues is estimated at $2.4 billion for June,
which brings the second quarter average of these issues to over $2.0
billion, nearly equal to the 1967 second quarter.

One of the factors accounting for the enlarged public bond
volume in June has been the sizable volume of industrial bond offerings
added to a near record monthly total of utility issues. Although
rumored industrial financings continue to abound, the volume of public

III -13
utility issues now scheduled for July is relatively small,chiefly for
seasonal reasons. The utility volume is less than one-half that in
June and represents a major basis for the expected decline in July
security financing, as shown in the last line of the table. All
of this decline from the June volume reflects a probable drop-off in
public offerings. The apparent void in the July calendar, however,
could be filled quickly if a few large industrial offerings come to market.
With the municipal market deteriorating during the second
half of May, announced postponements of bond issues increased to slightly
more than $200 million, nearly twice the average monthly volume
recorded over the first four months of this year. Even so, actual
offerings in May were estimated to have aggregated about $1.2 billion--
maintaining the large volume of issues earlier this year. Available
evidence suggests this high level of offerings is likely to remain
over the near-term--despite the continuation of reduced purchases
by commercial banks--with June estimated at $1.3 billion and July at
$1.2 billion,

Some additional information recently has become available
in the likelihood of significant industrial revenue bond financing
this year. The bill presently before Congress would permit tax-free
financing of issues over $1 million if commitments had been made by
May 1, 1968. It appears that the interpretation of commitments will
be very liberal, and underwriters report at least $500 million could
be brought to market in the near future. Immediate marketing of
these issues is presently constrained by the current level of yields
and the apparent additional yield premium required to induce investors
to take such offerings, given the possibility that interest on the
issues may become taxable. However, when the controversy is clarified
it seems likely that industrial revenue bond financing may balloon
temporarily. Such clarification should come with action on the tax
bill, in as much as a rider to the bill contains the current proposal
before Congress.
Stock market. In the two trading days following the Board's
announcement of a 10 percentage point increase in margin requirements,
common stock prices continued to advance in heavy trading. Since late
May, common stock prices have resumed the advance which had begun in
April but then had lost momentum during most of May. The sudden
apparent shift in investor attitudes is apparently a reaction to the
improved prospects for the passage of the tax bill to be followed--
the market assumes--by an easing of monetary policy. By early June,
stock prices indices--with the exception of Dow Jones Industrials-

As has been the case in all recent market advances, the less
seasoned stocks, such as those listed on the American Stock Exchange,
have experienced the sharpest increases in prices and trading volume.
The ratio of trading volume on the American Stock Exchange to that on
the New York Stock Exchange--commonly viewed as a rough index of
speculative trading activity in the stock market--rose dramatically
in May and early June. Moreover, price advances carried aggregate
American Stock Exchange price-earnings ratios to record highs at the
end of May; over one-third of the issues of American Stock Exchange
firms with any profits were selling at 30 or more times earnings,
whereas a year earlier only one-eighth of American Stock Exchange issues
were selling at such multiples. In contrast, the price-earnings ratios
on the New York Stock Exchange--as measured by the Standard & Poor's
500 stocks--stood at 18 on June 5, still below the 1967 high.
However, stock prices of certain industry groups on the New York Stock
Exchange--such as "glamour" issues, stocks of industries that would
benefit from an easing of monetary policy, and inflation hedge stocks--
have shown sharp increases this spring.
Further indications that speculative activity has heightened
on both exchanges also were displayed by the exchange officials.
The New York Stock Exchange strongly urged voluntary cutbacks in
operations, the American Exchange issued a stern warning against
speculation, and both raised the number of issues subject to 100
per cent margin requirements to near record levels.

III -17
Incomplete data suggest that stock market credit in May
rose sharply to a new high of almost $9 billion. Although tabulations
have not yet been completed for the margin panel, the New York Stock
Exchange staff indicate that the increase in margin debt last month
was probably about the same as that in April or about $190 million.
Furthermore, they believe that the number of margin accounts also
advanced sharply during May--even more than the 20,000 increase in
April. Final figures on weekly reporting large commercial banks
indicate an increase in non-broker security loans of about $10 million
in May, the first monthly increase this year.
U.S. Government securities market. After rising sharply to
new highs just before the last meeting of the Committee, yields on U.S.
Government securities have since dropped from 20 to 45 basis points.
The abruptness of the reversal reflected the sudden renewal of hopes
for passage of the tax bill, just when the bill had seemed dead. Comment
from Chairman Mills forecasting a favorable House vote in June, and later
from President Johnson acceding to the $6 billion spending cut, accounted
for the change.
In early June yields on Treasury issues stopped declining as
shown in the table, at levels close to those which had prevailed in mid-
May when favorable action on fiscal restraint legislation also had seemed
highly promising. Announcement of the further delay in the House vote
until June 20 caused temporary consternation in the market; while a
statement from Mills that the delay would not change the outlook for
ultimate House action generally reassured market participants, yields
have since backed up somewhat, particularly on Treasury bills.

During the period of sharply declining yields, Government
security dealers added significantly to their positions, particularly
in Treasury bills. A few investors apparently also added marginally
to their holdings of longer-term Treasury issues--possibly in
anticipation of future rate declines--and some investors who still
held temporary positions in the recently offered 6 per cent Treasury
notes took advantage of the market improvement to liquidate these
holdings.
The decline in yields also created a favorable market in which
to sell the $500 million of Export-Import Bank participation certificates.
This issue, offered on June 4 at 6-5/8 per cent, sold-out quickly even
though its reoffering rate was 1/4 of a percentage point below the
one underwriters thought might be needed prior to the down-turn of
yields.

III -19
In the Treasury bill area, rate declines were greatest on
longer maturities, suggesting expectations of an easing in monetary
policy following enactment of the tax bill. While cash redemptions
of maturing June tax bills not turned-in for taxes might possibly
tend to reduce bill rates again later in the month, efforts of banks
to issue new CD's to cover June maturities, in combination with the
prospect for large Treasury cash borrowing early in the new fiscal
year, will be operating as strong potential offsets to this tendency.
Most recently, Treasury bill rates have backed up about 10 basis
points--reflecting dealer efforts to pare positions as money market
conditions have firmed.
Other short-term rates. Yields on most short-term
obligations other than bills also have declined since the preceding
meeting of the Committee, as indicated in the accompanying table.
However, rates on commercial paper and finance company paper have
been sluggish in following the decline of other rates, as is often the
case with these types of instruments.
The rate on prime 4-to-6-month commercial paper, for example,
has been 6.25 per cent (on a bank discount basis) since the third
week in May. The investment yield at this rate on a 6-month maturity
would be about 6.52 per cent. This compares favorably with the 6.25
per cent ceiling rate that banks are permitted to pay on new CD's,
and thus to some extent may be tending to inhibit banks in their
efforts to replace maturing June CD's.

Federal Finance. The Treasury will be making large repayments
of debt during June, as $5.5 billion of tax bills mature. Only $1.0
billion of this repayment is presently scheduled to be offset by new
borrowing, half from the recently offered Ex-Im participation certifi-
cate and the other half from additions to regular bill auctions. Thus,
despite a sizable seasonal surplus of regular Federal receipts over
outlays in June, the Treasury's cash balance is estimated to decline
further, to and end-of-month level of about $4.5 billion.

Our projection for July and subsequent months assumes passage
before the end of June of the Revenue and Expenditure Control Act now
scheduled for a House vote on June 20. The Act authorizes the Treasury
to set a date within 30 days after enactment on which corporations must
pay the bulkof their retroactive surtax and acceleration liability.
Corporate payments subject to this call total $1.1 billion. However,
since the bill is not likely to be enacted before late June, the
projection assumes the Treasury will not set the call date until
sometime in July,

III- 22
Because of the relatively low cash balance at the end of June
and a large--partly seasonal--cash deficit expected in July, the
Treasury will need to borrow an estimated $4 billion early in the
new fiscal year. Unless the Treasury were to borrow
temporarily from the Federal Reserve on special certificates, payment
for this borrowing would probably be needed by July 9. While there
has been some discussion of anticipating this need in June, with a
borrowing timed for payment on June 24 when an estimated $3 billion or
more of maturing tax bills will be redeemed for cash, this alternative
no longer seems feasible in view of the delay in the House vote on the
tax bill.
In August, the Treasury will again need to borrow from $3.5
to $4.0 billion in order to enter September with a balance large
enough to tide the Treasury over until income tax payments are received
after mid-September. These tax payments are expected to swell the end
of September balance to more than $8,5 billion and will thus help
to minimize the volume of borrowing needed to cover the expected
further deficit in October.

U.S. balance of payments. Preliminary data indicate the
liquidity deficit before special transactions in April-May to be about
$750 million (not seasonally adjusted). At a seasonally adjusted rate
this deficit would be somewhat lower than that of the corresponding
period of 1967 but greater than in the first quarter of this year. The
deficit in May was down sharply from the very large deficit in April but
this improvement stemmed, in part, from two unusual items in addition to
those included in special transactions: (1) Redemption of $150 million
of maturing IBRD securities held by U.S. residents, and (2) A special
direct investment inflow of $50 million from a group of European banks.
Special transactions in May amounted to $300 million and consisted
almost entirely of Canadian purchases of nonconvertible Treasury notes.
On an official reserve transaction basis, the April-May
balance is estimated to be a surplus of $600 million (not seasonally
adjusted) compared with a deficit of over $900 million in the same two
months of 1967. The surplus this year was largely associated with the
heavy inflow of funds from foreign branches of U.S. banks. In the
month of May alone the liabilities of U.S. banks to their branches
abroad expanded by over $1 billion. In the same period last year such
liabilities were being reduced. Transactions relating to the support
of sterling and the French franc may have contributed both to the
inflow through U.S. bank branches and to other inflows which produced
the official settlements surplus.

IV -2
Foreign purchases of U.S. stocks in April were high, and
offerings of long-term securities by U.S. companies in the Euro-bond
market in the first five months of this year approached $1 billion.
Flotations in April-May totaled over $400 million.
In April, net U.S. purchase of foreign securities, largely
Canadian, amounted to about $200 million, nearly one-half as much as
total purchases in the first quarter.
Euro-dollar market developments. Euro-dollar rates during the
period May 1 to May 29 advanced by an average of nearly 60 basis points
in the one-, three-, six-, and twelve-month maturities. The largest
rate increases occurred in the two weeks between May 15 and May 29
(see table below). More recently, rates have fallen back to about the
mid-May level.

A major influence on the Euro-dollar market during the month
was the sharp tightening of U.S. money market conditions following the
mid-May news that there would be a further delay in congressional action
on the tax bill. This development was reflected in a large increase in

IV -3
U.S. banks' demand for funds from their branches operating abroad. From
May 1 to 29 U.S. banks' liabilities to their foreign branches increased
by over $1,100 million (an increase of about 23 per cent); the largest
increase ($542 million) occurred in the week of May 15 to 22.
At the same time, outflows from sterling and French francs
swelled the supply of funds in the Euro-dollar market and prevented
Euro-dollar rates from being bid even higher. More recent moderation
of rates has come with a reduction in the rate of transfers from branches
to home offices.
U.S. foreign trade. The trade balance in April returned to
an export surplus following an import balance in March. The March
balance was affected by the New York port strike, unusual low shipments
of aircraft and a dip in exports to Canada. The surplus for March and
April together, however, was still far below that of the first two
months of this year and the closing months of 1967. For January-April
as a whole, the trade surplus (balance of payments basis) was only $1.0
billion at an annual rate, a further drop from the poor rate of $1.3
billion in the last quarter of 1967.
Exports in April expanded by 18 per cent from the low March
level. This sharp rise reflects, in large measure, shipments delayed
by the New York port strike in March. Deliveries of aircraft, agri-
cultural products and shipments to Canada also advanced from those in
March. For the months of January through April combined, exports were
at a rate of about 8 per cent higher than in the fourth quarter of

IV -4
last year. Exports of both agricultural and nonagricultural commodities
expanded this year. Wheat and rice shipments, principally financed
with P.L. 480 funds, to India, Indonesia and Viet Nam were particularly
strong. Commercial shipments of corn also expanded as supplies in
competing export countries became more limited. Among nonagricultural
products, about two-thirds of the gain was in increased deliveries of
aircraft, and cars to Canada.

By area, the greatest growth in exports in the first four
months of the year was in shipments to Latin American, Asian and
African countries. Exports to Japan and Canada also expanded but at
a slower rate. Shipments to Western Europe, however, show very little
change from the fourth quarter, aside from an increase in deliveries

IV -5
of aircraft. While economic activity in Continental European countries
has expanded sharply since last fall, this upturn has not yet resulted
in a substantially greater demand for U.S. products.
U.S. exports to EEC countries, other than Germany, for January-
April this year were only about 6 per cent greater than shipments during
the same period last year. But U.S. shipments to Germany were about
$70 million less than a year earlier. Consequently the net increase in
U.S. exports to the EEC countries was virtually nil.
Looking more closely at Germany, total German imports have
increased sharply since October 1967. But the U.S. share of German
imports has been and continues to be a decreasing proportion of their
total imports. The main impetus for the recent increase in German
imports has come from sharp increases in raw materials and semifinished
or intermediate products.
U.S. imports increased only slightly in April and have remained
fairly stable during the first four months of this year. Imports for
January through April combined, however, were at a rate about 10 per cent
higher than in the fourth quarter. In contrast to exports, the current
expansion in imports is broadly based with all categories of goods
increasing.
Arrivals of steel, copper and aluminum were particularly strong,
and continued to reflect actual or potential work stoppages. Despite
settlement of the copper strike in March, imports of copper in April
were about 20 per cent higher than the monthly average in the first

IV -6
three months, as deliveries were made against orders placed earlier.
With the recent negotiation of new labor contracts in the aluminum
industry, the exceptionally high level of aluminum imports in March
and April is not likely to persist after May. Steel imports, however,
which in January-April were 50 per cent greater than the fourth quarter
rate, may be expected to expand further in the coming months, as labor
negotiations continue.
Imports of automobiles, both from Canada and Europe, were
exceptionally heavy during January-April. Canadian production of
cars topped 100,000 units for the first time in May, suggesting an
even further increase in car arrivals from that country in the
immediate future. Sales in the U.S. of European and Japanese cars
set new records for the fourth consecutive month in May; current sales
are close to an annual rate of a million cars, compared with less than
800,000 in 1967.
Although the overall rate of capacity utilization in manu-
facturing continues to be relatively low, about 84 per cent, higher
rates in some individual industries may be inducing additional purchases
of these products from foreign sources. The capacity-utilization rate
in textiles is now about 92 per cent, considerably above the rate in
mid-1967. Imports of textiles and apparel have expanded substantially
from the fourth to the first quarter. Another example may be in heavy
electrical-generating equipment. Domestic orders for such machinery
have been accelerating for over two years, the approximate lead-time

IV -7
required for production of such equipment. The strong current rise in
these imports may therefore reflect orders placed earlier when the
domestic capacity-utilization ratio first began to rise.
Trade Expansion.Act. On May 28 the President submitted to
Congress the Trade Expansion Act of 1968. The proposed bill contains
provisions in three basic fields.
(1) Extension of the President's authority to modify
tariffs to July 1, 1970. No major tariff negoti-
ations are contemplated but the authority is needed
for maintaining flexibility in the GATT.
(2) Approval of the Supplementary Agreement concerning
chemicals, the "ASP Package," of the Kennedy Round
of negotiations. This provision would eliminate the
use of the American Selling Price system of tariff
valuation for benzenoid chemicals produced in the
U.S. In return, the EEC would eliminate the
discriminatory features of their automobile road
taxes on American types of autos and also reduce
further their tariffs on chemical imports from the U.S.
(3) Liberalization of the criteria and procedures for ex-
tending adjustment assistance to firms or groups of
workers affected by import competition.
The proposed bill omitted recommendations for such trade
measures as import surcharges, import quotas, or tax rebates on exports.
Such measures were considered but it was decided that the longer-term
risks involved would outweigh any possible temporary benefits.

IV -8
Payments balances of other industrial countries. Large
imbalances in the payments positions of European countries have per-
sisted in 1968, with no sign as yet that the disequilibria have begun
to be reduced to any important degree. British trade deficits in the
first four months of this year were larger than at any time in many
years, except for last October-November when trade movements were
distorted by the dock strikes. Consequently, this year has seen a
widening of the seasonally-adjusted rate of Britain's over-all pay-
ments deficit.
On the Continent, Germany and Italy have continued to run
large surpluses. Payments positions of Continental countries in the
aggregate are being adversely affected by the U.S. balance of pay-
ments program, but so far the effects of that program have been in
good measure offset by very large increases in exports of Continental
countries to the United States. France, however, has moved into
deficit this year despite an improved trade performance. The civil
unrest in France in May caused a heavy capital outflow and prompted
the reimposition of exchange controls at the end of the month.
In Canada, there has been an appreciable reflow of funds
since mid-March when the exemption of Canada from the U.S. balance
of payments program, and the end of heavy gold buying in Europe,
halted the previous intense speculation against the Canadian

IV -9
dollar. However, to rebuild reserves the Canadian government has
recently borrowed in Europe and intends to borrow in the United
States. Japan's external balance, in substantial deficit last year,
has improved dramatically in 1968.
OECD experts feel that, between now and the end of the
year, serious imbalances in world payments will begin to be corrected
in significant degree. It is expected that the British trade balance
will improve very decidedly, in response to the devaluation last
November, the tax increases imposed in March, and the cessation of
forces that have kept British imports unexpectedly high so far this
year. The current account of the United States is also seen as im-
proving in the second half, partly because the fiscal actions ex-
pected to be taken shortly will slow demand expansion and partly
becauseof the disappearance of special factors that have swollen
the volume of U.S. imports. From the first half of 1968 to the
second half, the current account balances of the United States and
the United Kingdom, together, may improve by a total of $3.5 billion
at a seasonally-adjusted annual rate.
Partly because of the U.S. and U.K. measures, the current-
account surplus of the European Common Market countries may shrink,
between the firstand second halves, by $2 billion at a seasonally-
adjusted annual rate, according to OECD projections prepared before
the May strikes in France. Most of this adjustment would be borne

IV -10
by Germany and Italy. The forecast reduction of the Common Market
surplus rests on the assumption that rates of demand expansion will
not slow down in most of the Common Market countries, but does allow
for a substantial slowdown in Germany in the second half. It seems
likely that the terms on which the strikes are being settled in France
will lead to a substantial deficit for France and a rise in French
imports that will help sustain demand expansion elsewhere in Europe.
As shown in the table,in the 12 months ending March 31
Britain had a balance of payments deficit of $2.9 billion (CONFIDENTIAL)
as measured by changes in official foreign assets and liabilities.
In 1968 the seasonally-adjusted rate of deficit has been larger still,
because of the worsened trade performance. The deficit on trade (on
a balance of payments basis) was $1.8 billion in the 12 months through
March, but rose to a seasonally-adjusted annual rate of $2.1 billion
in January-April; the deterioration measured by this comparison would
have been larger if the dock strikes in the autumn of 1967 had not
delayed some export shipments until early 1968.
Since devaluation, the volume of British exports has risen
because of their lower average price in foreign currencies, soaring
import demand in the United States, and expansion of import demands
in most other countries. The dollar value of exports has increased
less than the volume because export prices in terms of foreign cur-
rencies have been reduced on the average by an estimated 9 per cent

from levels prevailing before devaluation. However, contrary to
expectations, the volume of British imports has also increased since
devaluation, apparently because of restocking of inventories of im-
ported raw materials and a surge in consumer buying in anticipation
of higher taxes on retail purchases effective in mid-March. With
private consumption (in real terms) now declining after a prolonged
upswing, the OECD secretariat looks for a 5 per cent drop in the
volume of British imports between the first and second halves of
this year. At the same time, it is felt that slower demand expan-
sion in the United States and Germany in the second half will not
slow the rise of British exports because the favorable response to
devaluation will increase as time passes.
Since devaluation, pressures on British reserves have been
severe not only because of the trade deficit but also because of
conditions affecting capital flows. The Bank of England has had
to meet large maturing forward sales of dollars and very little of
this outflow has been reinvested in sterling assets. With confidence
in sterling still at a low level, high interest rates in Britain
have failed to attract funds on an uncovered basis, and the per-
sistently wide forward discount on the pound has made covered yields
on sterling assets unattractive- Movement of official reserves out
of sterling by members of the overseas sterling area has added to
the drain on British gold and dollar reserves this year. To en-
courage retention of sterling reserves, the U.K. authorities have

IV -13
agreed to convert part of Hong Kong's official sterling reserves
into bonds denominated in Hong Kong dollars; the conversion privilege
would apply to a maximum of one-half of those reserves, or of $360
million equivalent, whichever is lower. At present, Hong Kong offi-
cial sterling reserves are estimated at about $500 million equivalent.
Germany's over-all surplus in the 12 months to March 31 was
$827 million on the basis of official settlements and changes in com-
mercial bank net foreign assets. In the first quarter of 1968 the
surplus was not much less than it had been a year earlier. The trade
balance was the same in both periods. The balance on services showed
some year-to-year improvement, but this was more than offset by an
adverse shift in the private nonbank capital account. The net inflow
of foreign and German capital in January-March of this year totaled
only $66 million compared with $322 million in the same months last
year. All and more of this drop resulted because net long-term
capital outflows rose from $49 million to $416 million, in reflec-
tion of larger purchases of foreign securities by German residents
and repayments of foreign loans contracted earlier by German compa-
nies. Capital outflow has been encouraged by the maintenance of
easy monetary conditions in Germany, but the capital account has
presumably been affected also by the U.S. balance of payments pro-
gram and the upsurge of Euro-bond issues by U.S. companies and their
subsidiaries. Although German imports have been rising very rapidly

IV -14
since the resumption of domestic expansion last summer, through
March the rise in exports was nearly as fast. In April, seasonally-
adjusted exports fell rather sharply, and in consequence Germany had
an over-all payments deficit compared with a surplus in April of
last year.
German official net foreign assets increased more than $600
million in February-April, following a drop in January of about $200
million caused by reversal of year-end positioning. The February-
April rise, which was well in excess of the cumulative balance of
payments surplus for those months, partly reflected a decline in
German commercial banks' net foreign assets.
Italy's external position has strengthened this year, the
seasonal deficit in the first four months being substantially smaller
than a year earlier. Primarily this reflected a shrinkage of the
trade deficit. Italian exports have risen strongly since their de-
cline in the spring and summer of last year, and receipts from exports
in the first quarter were affected by smaller net extensions of trade
credits than had been the case in the like period of 1967. However,
some of the reduction in the trade deficit (measured by payments and
receipts) could also reflect delays in making payment for imports,
related to the fact that valuation problems posed by new Common
Market regulations have occasioned delays this year in customs
clearances for imports of corn and meat. These delays are the

IV -15
main reason why the customs data for Italian imports in the first
quarter show a year-to-year drop notwithstanding the strong internal
expansion during the intervening 12 months. In addition, special
factors caused imports of crude oil to be speeded up in the fourth
quarter of last year, following which there was slackening of such
imports. This displacement may have affected payments for oil im-
ports as well as the shipments themselves. The net outflow of non-
bank capital in the first quarter was somewhat larger than a year
earlier, but the rise was matched by renewal of the expansion of
net receipts from tourism and emigrant remittances.
The net foreign assets of Italian commercial banks increased
slightly in January-April, so that official net foreign assets declined
by somewhat more than the cumulative payments deficit in those months.
Italy's over-all surplus was $500 million in the 12 months
through last March, and its composition was typical of the past several
years. Net receipts from tourism, other services, and emigrant remit-
tances totaled nearly $2.5 billion, more than sufficient to cover a
trade deficit and a $1.0 billion net outflow of nonbank capital, al-
most all of which was private funds.
The balance in the external payments of France has shifted,
a small surplus of $56 million in the 12 months through last September
giving way to a deficit estimated at around $187 million in the 12-
month period terminating March 31 of this year. Since the balance

IV -16
on France's trade (excluding trade with the outer franc area) was
nearly $370 million more favorable in the latter of these two periods,
as measured by shipments through customs, it is clear that in the six-
month period covering the last quarter of 1967 and the first quarter
of 1968 there was an adverse year-to-year shift in other balance of
payments components of a magnitude in the neighborhood of $600 million,
of which close to $400 million was in the first quarter of this year.
Presumably the bulk of this deterioration in non-trade items was in
capital movements, and these figures suggest that the U.S. balance
of payments program is having a substantial impact on French payments.
However, it also seems likely that in November-December 1967 and in
March of this year the balance on non-trade items was affected by
large imports of non-monetary gold. In addition, the departure of
NATO from France red receipts by perhaps around $50 million in
October-March compared with a year earlier.
Nonbank capital outflow from France was heavy in May, in
which month official reserves of gold and convertible currencies
were drawn down $307 million. Across-the-board exchange controls
were reimposed temporarily effective May 31. Reportedly, the French
authorities intend to permit all current-account transactions as well
as all movements of foreign capital and French direct investment
abroad; thus, in practice restrictions would be applied only to out-
flows of French capital other than direct investment. Proceeds from

IV -17
exports and other current transactions must be sold to a French bank
within one month. France drew the equivalent of $745 million from
the International Monetary Fund on June 4. Gold and convertible-
currency reserves of the Bank of France were $5,720 million at the
end of May, but a substantial worsening of the French current account
seems highly likely. The terms on which the strikes are being settled
provide for hourly wage increases in June and October totaling 10 per
cent (less any increase granted in 1968 prior to June) as well as in-
creases in minimum wage rates of 35 per cent or more. In recent years,
annual wage increases in France have averaged about 6 per cent in the
private sector and 4 per cent in government.
In the smaller European countries, first-quarter results
for the Netherlands and Sweden indicate little year-to-year change
in the over-all payments positions of those countries. In Switzerland,
an adverse shift in capital movements (including commercial bank funds)
seems to have occurred. The seasonal decline in official net foreign
assets in January-April approximated that of last year, despite some
year-to-year improvement in the trade balance. In Belgium, both the
trade balance and the balance on non-trade items were less favorable
in the first quarter this year than last year, causing the over-all
balance to shift from surplus to deficit.
In Canada, official net foreign assets rose only $28 million
in 1967, but Canadian commercial banks increased their net assets
abroad by $322 million. The combined increase was substantially

IV -18
larger than in the preceding year, in reflection of a strengthened
current account. The trade surplus rose; exports increased $1 bil-
lion, 70 per cent of which was accounted for solely by increased
sales of automobiles and parts to the United States. Late in the
year, exports of copper to the United States rose sharply. Expo-67
added about $450 million to Canadian earnings last year.
Canada's payments situation changed abruptly with the
announcement of the U.S. balance of payments program. Despite U.S.
and Canadian intentions to the contrary, doubts arose whether Canada's
access to U.S. capital markets and bank credit would remain sufficient
to cover the structural deficit on current account, all of which is
on invisible transactions. Uncertainty that the exchange rate could
be maintained generated a heavy outflow of capital, principally of a
short-term nature. Official reserve losses for the period from
January 1 to March 15 totaled approximately $1 billion.
Pressure on the Canadian dollar ended in mid-March, mainly
because Canada was exempted from the U.S. balance of payments program
at this time. In addition, the communiqué of March 17 concerning the
intentions of leading central banks with regard to free gold market
operations aided confidence in the Canadian dollar because of brighter
prospects that existing exchange rates for leading currencies could
be maintained. During April and May there was a sizable reflow of
short-term funds into Canada, but not sufficient to make up for the
earlier reserve losses. To augment Canada's official reserves, in

IV -19
May the Canadian Government floated a 5-year loan on the German
capital market for $62 million equivalent, and borrowed $100 million
equivalent at medium-term from the Italian Exchange Office. The
Government is also floating a 20-year bond issue for $100 million
in the United States.
Canadian payments developments in the remainder of 1968
will be heavily influenced by U.S. fiscal policy and its impact on
aggregate demand, as well as by the extent to which the U.S. dollar
is untroubled by speculative attacks. A third factor could also be
important. Much of the speculation against the Canadian dollar in
the first quarter is believed to have been in the form of unfavorable
shifts in leads and lags in current payments. These shifts may well
be reversed in the course of the next few months. Official reserves
might increase in consequence, and the possibility exists that offi-
cial reserves might in fact rise above the $2.55 billion limit set
by agreement with the U.S. authorities, even assuming some early
repayments of Canadian drawings on the IMF and the Federal Reserve
swap line.
After registering a deficit of $570 million in 1967, the
Japanese balance of payments has shown very rapid improvement since
January. The deficit in the first four months of this year, when
seasonal factors were adverse, was about $90 million less than in
the same months of last year. Part of the improvement was caused

IV -20
by a cutback in the net outflow of long-term capital; additionally,
a favorable swing in errors and omissions took place which may have
reflected the effects on leads and lags of the tightening of mone-
tary conditions in Japan in the past year. Although the trade sur-
plus (imports f.o.b.) for January-April as a whole was nearly un-
changed from the year-earlier level, movements of Japanese trade
since late last year have been very favorable. From December to
April, exports rose 12 per cent (seasonally-adjusted) while imports
dropped 7 per cent; as a result, the trade balance shifted from a
$175 million deficit in December to a $10 million surplus in April.

APPENDIX A: SURVEY OF BANK LENDING PRACTICES. MAY 1968*
Two-thirds of the 125 banks reporting in the May 15 Bank
Lending Practices Survey indicated that demand for business loans
had been stronger than during the preceding three months. (See Table 1.)
This generally confirmed the anticipations expressed by over half of
the banks in the preceding survey that loan demand would be stronger
in this period. Nearly three-fourths of the reporting banks now
anticipate stronger loan demand during the next three months ending
in August. Both large and small banks reported firmer lending policies
during the February to May period.
Interest rates and compensating balance requirements
Given the March increase in the prime rate, almost 94 per
cent of the reporting banks raised interest rates on loans to non-
financial businesses. The number of banks raising interest rates
following the March prime rate increase was about three times the
number following the November prime rate increase. Similarly, the
number of banks reporting firmer compensating balance requirements,
which influence the effective interest rates borrowers must pay, was
almost four times greater following the prime rate increase in March
than in November. In the current survey, 60 per cent of the banks
firmed compensating balance requirements as well as raised their interest
rates to business borrowers.
Other nonprice terms and conditions. With respect to non-
price terms and conditions of business lending, around three-fifths of
the respondent banks reported firmer policies for nonlocal and new
customers and nearly half of these reported that their policies had
become "much firmer." For established or local service area customers,
however, less than one-third had firmed policies, and most of them
did so only "moderately.' About a third of the respondents had firmed
policies also on standards of credit worthiness and term loan
maturities. No banks had eased their nonprice terms and conditions for
making loans. This is in marked contrast to the preceding survey in
which 70 per cent of the banks reported their policies unchanged and a
small percentage of banks reported moderate easing in some areas.
Loans to finance companies
A substantial number of banks reported that their policies
on lending to "noncaptive" finance companies also had firmed over the
preceding three months. As usual, the extent of firming on these loans
had been somewhat less than that reported for nonfinancial businesses.
Nevertheless, over half the banks had firmed their policies regarding
interest rates and credit lines and one-fourth to one-third of them
regarding compensating balances.

Division of Research and Statistics.

Other types of loans
The firmer lending policies reported in this survey also
are reflected in the reduced willingness of banks to make particular
types of loans. For example, half the respondents reported that they
were less willing to make term loans to businesses and roughly two-
fifths were less willing to make various types of mortgage loans.
However, few banks had taken steps to restrain consumer instalment
loans; over 80 per cent of the respondents reported that their policies
on these loans were unchanged as compared to three months ago, while
12 per cent of the smaller banks were more willing to make them. There
was little indication of increased willingness to make any other type
of loan, which is in contrast with recent surveys.
Factors associated with policy changes
In their supplemental comments, several banks stated that
tighter monetary conditions, accompanied by slower growth of time and
savings deposits, as well as expectations that loan demand will con-
tinue to increase more rapidly than deposits were the predominant
reasons for the firmer lending policies they had adopted. In addition,
some banks indicated that they were having difficulty renewing CD's,
even after the recent increase in Regulation Q ceilings. The relatively
heavy restraint on loans to new or nonlocal customers reflected, as
one Cincinnati bank put it, a "desire to keep our powder dry for ex-
isting customers." Many banks mentioned that tightening in the
mortgage and construction loan categories had been quite severe.
While in the February 15 Survey, banks generally expressed
a "wait and see" attitude, in the current survey, banks gave evidence
that they had been bringing themselves in line with the more restric-
tive Federal Reserve policy.
