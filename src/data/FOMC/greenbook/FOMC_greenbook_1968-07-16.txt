through a comprehensive digitization proce ss which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain.

CURRENT ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL CONDITIONS

Board of Governors July 10, 1968
of the Federal Reserve System

I- 1
SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK
Outlook for economic activity
Third quarter GNP seems certain to show sharply slower
growth, reflecting in large part a slowing in inventory accumulation
as the buildup in steel is terminated and as businesses trim purchases
in line with the recently slower growth in consumption. Adding to
this short-term influence will be the combined impact of the tax sur-
charge, a tapering off of Federal expenditures, and a slide-off in
residential construction activity. In real terms, output is expected
to show little increase, even in the absence of a steel strike. The
easing in the economy should be evident in a more moderate rate of
industrial price increases--although the GNP deflator is likely to rise
somewhat faster in the third quarter as a result of the Federal pay
raise, which is counted as a price increase in the income and product
accounts.
With demands for manpower increasing only modestly, unemploy-
ment is expected to rise somewhat, and personal income to grow at a
slower rate. Increased tax withholdings are expected to keep disposable
personal income from rising much. The rise in personal consumption
expenditures in the third quarter seems likely to be slightly under the
second quarter increase--and that increase can occur only with a decline
in the rate of savings from the very high second quarter rate.
The slow growth in retail sales, except for autos, last
quarter suggests the accumulation of excess consumer stocks. In

I- 2
addition, auto inventories were raised to near-record levels, and
additional steel stocks accumulated in anticipation of a possible
strike. As a result of this large inventory investment and heavy over-
hang and the beginning of liquidation of steel inventories whether or
not there is a strike, a smaller rate of inventory accumulation is
expected in the third quarter. A steel strike could result in an even
greater run-off of inventories and further retardation of over-all
economic activity.
Most major sectors of activity appear likely to either show
less strength or actually decline in the current quarter. Federal
expenditures are expected to expand less rapidly, with most of the rise
reflecting the pay raise, and private construction activity and expen-
ditures are expected to dip as a result of reduced availability of
mortgage funds and tight monetary policy. Only plant and equipment
expenditures are projected to rise somewhat--based upon the results of
the Commerce-SEC survey of business anticipations. Even here, actual
second quarter expenditures appear to have fallen short of the survey
expectations, casting some doubt on the full realization of the earlier
projections in an atmosphere of curtailed growth and profit margins.
Outlook for prices and resource use
Industrial production, which has moved up at a moderate pace
(at about a 5 per cent annual rate for the second quarter as a whole--
about in line with real GNP as revised), may decline somewhat after
July as excessive inventories-of steel and probably also autos and

I-3
some other consumer durables--are worked down. Hours of work and
employment in manufacturing are also likely to edge off, and the rate
of manufacturing capacity utilization is expected to fall below the
84 per cent plateau maintained since last summer. With growth in real
output slowing, employment expansion is likely to taper off further and
the unemployment rate to rise somewhat.
The upward movement in consumer prices--at a 4 per cent rate
over the past year--has shown no sign of slackening yet, nor have the
efforts of workers to achieve wage increases now that will recoup past
cost-of-living increases and assure ample growth in real wages in the
future. Contracts covering 1.3 million workers are up for negotiation
in this quarter and are expected to continue the pattern of high first-
year wage increases (7-1/2 to 10 per cent). In the fourth quarter,
however, the number of workers involved in new contract negotiations
will decline sharply.
Industrial prices resumed their upward course in June after
a 1-month decline. The current rise, however, lacks the vigor evident
last winter--with the number of products currently showing increases
at the lowest level since last September. With upward wage pressures
persisting when production--and presumably gains in productivity--is
declining, another spurt in unit labor costs may be in store for
industrial producers as business and consumer demands diminish. Under
these opposing pressures, the industrial price rise is likely to per-
sist, although at a more moderate pace. The sharp upward movement in

I-4
food prices this year may be approaching its zenith, and lagging
consumer demands may help to slow the rise in retail prices of other
goods and services in coming months.
Outlook for credit demands
Loan demand at banks may be expected to moderate over the
course of the summer, apart from any temporary bulge in reflection of
business payments of additional taxes due in mid-July stemming from the
surtax legislation. A reduced rate of inventory accumulation--once
needs in anticipation of a steel strike are satisfied--and a slower
growth in economic activity are likely to reduce business demands for
bank financing, given existing loan terms and conditions. Corporate
demands in the bond market, too, may moderate later this summer from
the relatively large volume of offerings in June and on the docket for
July.
On the other hand, State and local government offerings may
increase further from their already large volume, buoyed by industrial
revenue bonds offered to beat the yearend deadline removing tax exemp-
tion. And mortgage credit demands have shown little sign of abating
despite the record cost of mortgage finance, as basic housing require-
ments, pent-up after more than two years of under-building, have
continued to increase.
Further Federal Government borrowing will be added to private
capital market demands later this summer. The Treasury will have to
roll over $3.7 billion of maturing securities held by the public in

I-5
mid-August, and will also have to raise a substantial amount of new
cash (perhaps about $3 billion) during the month. While the timing and
form of Treasury offerings will depend on market conditions, it appears
likely that longer-term Treasury notes and possibly a PC could be
included.
Thus, from the demand side of markets alone, the prospect
for significant declines in interest rates during the summer depends
in large part on a possible curtailment of corporate security market
financing demands once the current spurt of new issues is marketed. An
actual easing of supply conditions, or a greater conviction of market
participants that credit will become more available, would tend to bring
interest rates down over a broad spectrum of credit instruments.
Outlook for supply of funds
The experience of thrift institutions with savings flows
during the current reinvestment period appears to be somewhat stronger
than might have been expected on the basis of existing interest rate
relationships, at least insofar as can be judged from fragmentary data
for the early part of the reinvestment period. And if short-term
interest rates ease further, these institutions may be expected to
accelerate their mortgage commitment activity in anticipation of a
further improvement of inflows.
Consumer-type time and savings deposits at banks have also
held up moderately well, and outstanding CD's have recently begun to
rise as Treasury bill rates have dropped and remained below Regulation Q

I-6
ceiling rates. It is likely that growth in time and savings deposits
this summer will be more rapid than the 3 per cent annual rate of the
second quarter. But under current market conditions, it is more con-
jectural whether time and savings deposits will recover to the 7 per
cent pace of the first quarter of 1968, a pace which was already
reflecting the constraints of developing monetary tightness.
Meanwhile, private demand deposits are not likely to be as
substantial a source of funds to banks over the summer, as transactions
needs moderate. Nor are Euro-dollars likely to be as readily available
if confidence in the franc and the pound is re-established.
On balance, it appears that the projected continued sizable
total demands on credit markets will be accompanied by only a modest
increase in over-all credit availability under existing monetary condi-
tions.
Balance of payments
Although the dollar strengthened in foreign exchange markets
in May and June as a result of new doubts about the French franc and
the British pound and of enactment of the U.S. fiscal restraint program,
the underlying U.S. payments position has remained unsatisfactory.
The published balance of payments deficit on the liquidity
basis in the second quarter may be less than $1 billion at a seasonally
adjusted annual rate, down from $2-1/2 billion in the first quarter and
the smallest for any quarter since 1966. All of the second quarter

I-7
reduction, however, reflected special official transactions, including
a large shift of Canadian reserves from short-term to over-one-year
securities, and sales of nonmarketable U.S. notes to the German central
bank and to German commercial banks. Before special transactions, the
liquidity deficit remained near $4 billion at an annual rate, as in the
first quarter. The net export surplus on goods and services remained
very small, and an increase in net outflows of U.S. capital from their
abnormally low first quarter level was apparently matched by an increase
to record levels of foreign purchases of U.S. corporate stocks and
Euro-bonds.
Since foreign private liquid funds also poured in in record
volume during the second quarter, the official settlements balance swung
into substantial surplus.
Inflows of foreign capital, both liquid and nonliquid, are
unlikely to continue at recent record rates for long, even at present
interest rate relationships. France and Britain could not long sustain
reserve drains on the scale experienced in May and June, and U.S.
corporate equities may lose some of their recent attraction for
foreigners as the U.S. economic expansion slows down. Hence, even
though the U.S. trade balance is expected to recover fairly rapidly
during the second half year. the liquidity deficit before special trans-
actions may continue at about a $4 billion annual rate, and the official
settlements balance is likely to revert to deficit.

II -I
THE ECONOMIC PICTURE IN DETAIL
Gross national product. Recent data on retail sales and
employment have caused us to revise down sharply our estimate of the
rise in GNP in the second quarter. Currently, we estimate the increase
at a rate of $18.5 billion, about $3-1/2 billion less than indicated
in the last Greenbook, with the annual rate of growth in real GNP
slowing from 6 per cent in the first quarter to 5 per cent, Further
marked slowing in activity is projected in the summer months as the
surtax offsets the growth in incomes. In the third quarter the rise
in GNP is estimated at only $9 billion, with little growth in real
output.
With demand weakening, price increases are expected to
moderate somewhat in the private economy, but the wage increase for
Federal government workers--which is treated as a price increase in
the national income accounts--is expected to raise the GNP deflator
from 3.7 per cent in the second quarter to 4 per cent in the third.
The deceleration in second quarter activity resulted largely
from a sluggish rise in consumer buying despite a continued large
rise in disposable income. Little change was recorded in sales for
most categories of nondurable and durable goods, except for an increase
in auto marketings. Weak detail sales in April were at first largely
attributed to civil disturbances, but the May recovery was modest
and retail sales in June, according to the weekly data, changed
little from the May level. (Preliminary data for the month of June
are not yet available). Personal consumption expenditures rose by

II -2
an estimated $7 billion in the second quarter as compared to $17 billion
in the first, while the savings rate returned to the high fourth quarter
rate of 7.6 per cent.
No satisfactory explanation for the abrupt slow-down in sales
between the first and second quarters is readily available in view of
a rise in income which was only moderately below the record first
quarter. Price increases may have limited sales, and the surtax
may have cast its shadow, but, according to a recent survey of consumer
sentiment, continued apprehension over the international situation--
and not the upcoming tax increase--was a major cause of buyer hesitancy.
But basically, consumers' behavior remains as puzzling in the spring
of 1968 as it was all through 1967, when consumers maintained an
exceptionally high savings rate despite a steady growth in real as
well as money income.
The second quarter estimate of business investment in plant
and equipment has also been revised down, since recent data suggest
an even more severe drop than was indicated in the May Commerce-SEC
plant and equipment survey. Net exports last quarter also fell
considerably below expectations, contributing to weaker growth in
total GNP.
Inventories apparently rose at a sharply increased rate, on
the other hand, partly because of slack sales in many consumer durable
and nondurable goods lines. Auto inventories rose to near-record
levels and steel stocks continued to mount in anticipation of the strike
deadline August 1st. At this point, inventory data for all business

II -3
sectors are available only for April, but production and sales estimates
suggest that the physical volume of nonfarm inventories may have climbed
at a rate of about $8 billion last quarter.
The imposition of the tax surcharge, in conjunction with a
likely reduction in the growth of Federal expenditues, a decline in
residential construction outlays, and a smaller rate of inventory
accumulation will probably result in a virtual halt in the rate of
growth in real GNP in the third quarter.
The rise in personal income will reflect a general slowing
in the economy. Although wages are continuing to rise briskly and the
Federal pay raise will add $1.9 billion to before-tax income this
month, easing in economic activity is likely to result in slower
employment growth, curtailed workweek schedules, and a smaller gain
in wage and salary payments.
Most of the $10 billion rise in personal income anticipated
in this quarter will be offset by the increased withholdings of
10 per cent on all families now subject to the income tax. Social
security taxes, which normally fall sharply in the third quarter as
the taxable wage-ceiling is attained, will continue to absorb
about 4.4 per cent of workers' pay this year, owing to the statutory
increase in the amount of annual wage and salary earnings subject to
tax. (This is not reflected in the national income accounts for
technical reasons, but it will nonetheless deter spending.)

II -4
We are projecting a rise in consumption of about $6.5 billion
this quarter, despite the leveling in spendable income. This
estimate is consistent with a dip in the rate of savings to about
6.5 per cent from the 7.6 per cent of last quarter as consumers
attempt to maintain living standards. This saving rate is still
relatively high compared to most recent years. Although the rise in
spending is comparable to that of the previous quarter, the durables
component is somewhat weaker. Over a period of time, sales of nondurable
tend to follow the upward trend in population, prices, and income,
notwithstanding sharp variations from quarter to quarter. Service
outlays show a fairly regular pattern of increase regardless of short-
term variation in income or in other expenditures. These two
categories may thus be relatively immune to the sharp break in the
upward trend in income. Durable goods sales, on the other hand, should
be adversely affected, even though auto dealers will be making
exceptional efforts to dispose of heavy stocks before fall.
Nonfarm inventory accumulation is expected to dip from an
estimated $8.0 billion in the second quarter to $5.0 billion in the
third. The disappointing retail sales picture probably resulted in
some overhang of stocks of many consumer goods, which should
eventuate in a lower rate of accumulation this quarter. In addition,
steel stocks accumulated in anticipation of a strike, will be run
down for the remainder of the year even if, as we have assumed, a
strike is avoided and there is a steel settlement by August 1.

II -5
(If there should be an industry-wide steel strike, which
remains a distinct possibility, the depressing effect on inventories
and on output would be more severe. If a strike lasted 6 weeks,
nonfarm inventory investment would be reduced by about $2 billion
below the $5.0 billion now projected. Some 450,000 workers would
be directly affected and wage and salary payments would be lowered
by over $2 billion /annual rate/ in the third quarter).
Restrictive conditions in the mortgage market are likely to
reduce housing starts in the third quarter to a rate of 1.33 million
units--down from 1.41 million in the second quarter--and expenditures
for residential construction may dip by $1-1/2 billion to $27.9 billion.
Business investment in plant and equipment however, should rise this
quarter if business intentions as disclosed in the Commerce-SEC
survey are realized. However, the drop in these expenditures in the
second quarter appears to have been sharper than the survey anticipated,
indicating that fixed investment may not rise as much as previously
planned in the last half of this year. The full impact of the rise
in taxes in reducing profit margins may not have been anticipated
in May.
Although the tax increase should act as the major source of
fiscal restraint in the third quarter, the effort to reduce Federal
expenditures is also likely to begin to affect both Federal and State-
local purchases of goods and services. After rising by an estimated
$2.5 billion last quarter, defense spending--excluding the impact
of the pay raise--is expected to increase by less than $0.5 billion
this quarter. The small increase projected in nondefense expenditures
mainly reflects the pay increase.

II -6
With the tax take rising sharply, the Federal deficit, NIA
basis, is likely to be cut from an annual rate of $10.7 billion in
the second quarter to about $6.0 billion, if Federal spending is
restrained as indicated above. This compares with a peak rate for
recent years of almost $15 billion, reached in the second quarter of
last year.

Industrial production. Industrial production in June is
presently estimated to have increased somewhat from an upward revised
May level. Total production worker manhours in manufacturing have
been revised up 1 per cent in May and the preliminary June data are
up 0.5 of one per cent. (Upward revision of the May production index
now published at 163.7, however, probably will be only about half
as large as the manhours revision.) Other available data indicate
a continuing high level of output, except for the aluminum strike
which will amount to about -.3 of one point in the total index. Auto
assemblies were unchanged from the May seasonally adjusted annual
rate of 9.4 million units and truck production remained at record
levels. Other indicators of economic activity--output of raw steel,
paperboard, electric power generation, and miscellaneous freight
car loadings--continued at high levels.
One measure of the ability of manufacturing to expand
production is the capacity utilization rate, which in May was estimated
at 84.0 per cent. While ample plant capacity is clearly at hand, it
has been suggested that current tightness in the labor market may
serve to restrict further output expansion. While both production
worker employment and average hours worked in manufacturing have risen
from their 1967 lows, in June they were still well below the record
levels reached in late 1966, as shown in the table. Manufacturing
output, however, reflecting gains in productivity, was up around
2.5 per cent in June from the December 1966 high and could be

II -10
increased further by lengthening the workweek, and, in the durable
goods industries by increasing employment to the levels reached in
1966.

e Estimated roughly.
While declines in the workweek have occurred in all durable
and nondurable manufacturing industries, the decline in the number of
production workers has centered in the durable goods industries with
large declines, 5 per cent or more, in primary metals (before the
aluminum strike), electrical and nonelectrical machinery, and lumber.
The only manufacturing industries showing a rise in the number of
production workers from their 1966 highs are transportation equipment,
paper, printing, chemicals, and rubber. In these industries, however,
the increase in the number of workers has been accompanied by declines
in the workweek ranging from .3 to .8 hours.
Capacity utilization. The May rate of manufacturing capacity
utilization is now estimated at 84.2 per cent, up from 83.8 per cent
the previous month. If manufacturing output increased slightly in
June, as indicated above, the operating rate will probable show little

II -11
change. At the 84 per cent level, current utilization rates are about
equal to their long-run average and similar to levels prevailing at the
beginning of 1964.
Recent operating rates have been high in the production of
iron and steel, motor vehicles, aircraft, petroleum and rubber.
Other manufacturing industries have substantial amounts of unused
capacity.

Unit auto sales and stocks. Dealer deliveries of new domestic
autos in the final 10 days of June were up sharply, and for the month
seasonally adjusted sales were at an annual rate of 8.8 million units,
slightly above the 8.7 million rate in May and sharply higher than
April's-7.9 million. June sales were 4 per cent larger than a year
earlier.
For the second quarter, new car sales were at
of almost 8.5 million units, up from 8.2 million in the
and 8.1 million a year earlier. Trade sources indicate
optimism for the current quarter although there is somean annual rate

continued
concern that

II -12
the recent unusually extensive sales contests may have shifted some
deliveries from the summer months. The trade does not expect the
10 per cent tax surcharge to have much effect on new car sales,
Seasonally adjusted dealer stocks of new cars stabilized
during the month of June and the supply (unadjusted) totaled about
1.7 million units by the end of the month, one fifth higher than a
year earlier. The days' supply of new cars based on the seasonally
adjusted stock-sales ratio reached about 50 days, down slightly from
May. The stock build-up which has taken place in recent months
apparently has been intentional because of anticipated strong sales
in the summer months and the possibility of a steel strike.
Sales of imported cars continued high in June and were almost
one-fifth above a year earlier. Seasonally adjusted, the annual rate
of sales of imported cars in the first half of this year has been about
910,000 units, an increase of almost 30 per cent from last year.
Consumer credit. Expansion in consumer credit picked up
noticeably in May. Instalment credit outstanding increased at a
seasonably adjusted annual rate of $7.3 billion, up from $6.5
billion a month ago and $2.3 billion a year ago. It was the largest
increase since March of 1966 and confirmed the broad advance in
consumer credit that began early this year. For the second quarter
as a whole the annual rate of expansion may approximate $7 billion,
up $1 billion from the first quarter and more than $4 billion from
a year- earlier when credit growth was unusually slow.

II -13
Demand for auto credit rose in May along with the rebound
in auto sales. A slightly larger average new-car note contributed
to the increased use of credit but it was the rise in unit sales of
autos that provided the major upward thrust. So far in 1968, net
increases in consumer auto debt have been at a $2.5 billion annual
rate, sharply higher than at any time last year and similar to the
rise in the first half of 1966.

Consumer demand for personal cash loans also was stronger
in May. Loan volume jumped to an annual rate of $28.7 billion, after
fluctuating in a narrow range around $27.5 billion since last summer.
In general, personal loans have not kept pace with rising expenditures
for consumer services during the past two years. There are a number
of reasons for this, but the increased use of credit cards to finance

II -14
travel and vacations is probably one of the more important. On balance,
this has resulted in a shift away from the personal loan category to
"other consumer goods" credit, where most credit card activity is now
classified.
Acceleration of growth in outstanding consumer instalment
credit reflects more rapid new credit extensions and a slower and more
typical rate of growth in repayments on existing debt, following the
exceptionally fast pace of last summer and fall. Growth in outstandings
is still not back to the record $8 billion increase recorded for
1965, but it may have approached that annual rate in June.
Retail sales. The dollar value of retail sales in June was
unchanged from May and totaled 5.7 per cent more than a year earlier,
with over half the year-to-year gain reflecting higher prices.
Durable goods sales rose nearly 1 per cent in June while
nondurables were off slightly. Except for autos and lumber, sales
at other stores were unchanged or down. Furniture sales were off
2 per cent.
For the entire second quarter, total retail sales were up
1.3 per cent from the first quarter, with durable goods up 2.3 per
cent and nondurable goods 0.8 per cent. The moderate second quarter
rise followed a sharp increase in the first quarter; from the fourth
to the first quarter, total retail sales increased 4.6 per cent,
with durables rising 6.3 per cent and nondurables 3.8 per cent.

II -15
Consumer buying sentiment. The May University of Michigan
Index of Consumer Sentiment indicates that consumers continue cautious.
In May 1968, the index declined to 92.6 from 95.3 in February.
Generally, the Survey Research Center suggests that the index should
move in the same direction for two quarters before a change in current
buying habits is signaled. Since the middle of 1967, little trend has
been evident--an increase in one quarter has been followed by a decrease
in the next. The May survey was completed before the assassination
of Senator Kennedy,
Over a longer period, there has been a significant drop in
the percentage of families with optimistic views about economic
prospects during the next 5 years. From 1963-1966, the proportion
of respondents saying there would be good times far outnumbered the
proportion saying that there would be bad times. Over the last two
years the spread between these views has narrowed and in the last
three months has almost disappeared.
Supplemental questions in May which are not included in the
index. but which are added to the survey because of their topical nature,
suggest that worries and uncertainties related to Viet Nam are mainly
responsible for the relatively low state of consumers' willingness to
buy. In the May survey, a special cross tabulation of expectations
was made, reflecting the respondents' evaluation of the course of the
war and their opinions about short and longer range business develop-
ments and expectations about their personal financial situations. It
was found that those who expected an improvement in the war situation
were much more optimistic than the others. But, since 63 per cent of

II -16
families thought that fighting would continue at the present level or
increase--despite the Paris talks--there was no basis on the grounds
of the peace negotiations to have expected a change in purchases
plan .
The latest surveys also continue to suggest that most
people react to price increases by delaying major expenditures so that
they will have more funds on hand to pay for necessities. But an
increasing percentage is saying that now is a good time to buy a car
because prices are going up. In May 1968, 31 per cent indicated
rising prices as a reason for buying a car now as compared with only
14 per cent the year before. The Survey Research Center believes
this desire to buy before prices for autos increase further explains
why buying plans for autos are less depressed than attitudes toward
business conditions and personal financial expectations alone would
indicate.

A supplemental question in the survey on the Federal surtax
suggests that anticipation of ill effects on business from the tax
increase has diminished during the last 6 months; in November 1967,
among those who expected a tax increase only 6 per cent thought it
would have good effects on business compared to 20 per cent in May 1968.
Business inventories. The book value of manufacturers'
stocks (preliminary) increased $300 million in May, down sharply
from the $737 million rise in April and back close to the relatively
low average monthly increase during the first quarter. At auto dealers
unit stocks of autos continued to expand, and a rise in total
manufacturers' shipments considerably in excess of the increase in
retail sales suggests another sizable expansion in total distributors'
inventories in May. Whether the latter increase could have equaled
the large $600 million increase in distributors' stocks now reported
for April--when retail sales slowed an unexpected sharp drop--is open
to question. For April and May together, the rate of total business
inventory accumulation clearly remained well above the low first
quarter rate.
At manufacturers, the book value of inventories in business
and defense equipment industries showed no change in May--as they had
for the first quarter as a whole--following a sharp spurt in April.
For other durable goods (including consumer durables), May accumulation
totaled nearly as much as in April and remained above the first
quarter rate. In nondurable goods industries, the book value increase
in May was down substantially from April and close to the first quarter
average.

II -18
With manufacturers' inventory accumulation moderating again
and with shipments up nearly 3-1/2 per cent from April and 2-1/2 per cent
from the previous high in March, the over-all factory stock-sales ratio
declined to 1.71 in May from 1.76 in April and 1.73 in March. The
May rate was about mid-way between the low 1965 average of 1.61 and the
1967 highs of over 1.80.
Orders for durable goods. New orders for durable goods increased
moderately in May, despite a sharp further decline in orders received
by the aerospace industry. New orders fbr machinery and equipment rose
4 per cent to the highest level since their peak of last August. New
orders for both steel and nonferrous metals also increased substantially.
The May durable new order level, though up nearly 2 per
cent from April, remained about 3 per cent below both March, when
aerospace orders spurted to an unprecendented high because of large
commercial "aerobus" orders, and December 1967, when orders bulged
for autos and parts after the strike and steel ordering reached a
peak.
Unfilled orders were about unchanged in May at a level 8
per cent above a year earlier, Of the increase in unfilled orders
over the year, the bulk was in the aerospace industry and most of
the remainder at steel mills. The machinery and equipment order back-
log was down moderately, with the decline concentrated in the first
five months of 1968. The unfilled orders -shipments ratio in May
was moderately below April and also May a year ago.

Construction and real estate. Seasonally adjusted construction
put in place--revised 3 per cent for the December-May period as a result of
a sharp upward revision for public construction--changed little in June
at a rate just below the new peak of $84.1 billion now reported for
February. As much as two-fifths of the year-to-year increase in total
construction outlays in June was attributable to higher costs.
Reflecting the sharp decline in housing starts after April,
private residential expenditures dipped in June for the first month in
a year and a half. Nonresidential construction expenditures--which
had tended downward earlier this spring--apparently changed little,
at a level 8 per cent below the early 1967 peak. Public construction
edged higher.(Billions adjusted)

1/ Seasonally adjusted annual rates; preliminary. Data for the most
recent month (June) are available under a confidential arrangement
with the Census Bureau. Under no circumstances should public
reference be made to them.
Seasonally adjusted private housing starts, which even after an
expected downward revision were at an unsustainably high annual rate of
1.59 million units in April, dropped sharply in May to a rate of 1.33
million, the lowest since last December. The May decline was probably
accentuated by unseasonally heavy rains. The decline was widespread
and actually carried starts below year-earlier rates in the Northeast
and North Central states. Multifamily units, which had soared highest
earlier this year, accounted for the greatest drop.
Building permits in permit-issuing areas also dropped in May
for the second consecutive month. However, with both permits and
mortgage-commitments still relatively high, the rate of starts probably
did not decline significantly further in June. If so, the annual rate
of starts in the second quarter as a whole most likely averaged just

II -21
above 1.4 million, down from the first quarter average
and about the same as in the third quarter of 1967.of 1.50 million

1/ Seasonally adjusted annual rates; preliminary.
Passage of the fiscal package in late June greatly improves
prospects for relief for lenders, builders, and buyers over the period
ahead. However, a sustained revival in the rate of starts is not
expected until next winter; this is because of the lag between changes
in financial market conditions--which are still somewhat uncertain--
and changes in housing starts. On the other hand, any further
reductions in housing starts this year will be limited in part by
demand pressures which have continued to build up over the past
2-1/2 years. In that period, the seasonally adjusted annual rate
of starts has approximated basic market requirements in only one
quarter--the first quarter of this year. As a result, vacancy rates--
mw

II -22
this year have not only remained abnormally low but have continued to
drop. In the first quarter of 1968, for example, rental vacancy rates--
at 5.5 per cent of all rental units available and fit for use--were
the lowest for any first quarter since 1957, when the initial post-World
War II shortages were still a market factor. Moreover, homeowner
vacancy rates, which are less sensitive than those for rental units,
averaged only 1.0 per cent in the first quarter of this year, This
rate compares with 1.2 per cent in the fourth quarter of last year as
well as for the year as a whole.

Labor market. The labor market continued generally firm in
June, although there were some signs of easing. Nonfarm payroll employ-
ment again increased only modestly and the unemployment rate rose to 3.8
per cent from 3.5 per cent in May. The increase in unemployment was
concentrated among 16 to 24 year-olds, who entered the labor focce in

II -23
greater-than-usual numbers at the end of the school year. While the
demand for new workers may have eased somewhat in June, the unemployment
rate for adult men (aged 25 and over) and the level of insured
unemployment remained extremely low.
Nonfarm payroll employment rose only 82,000 from May to
June and averaged 67.8 million for the quarter. Employment was up
360,000 from the first quarter, or by about half as much as the first
quarter rise. In part, the slower pace of employment growth in recent
months can be attributed to growing weakness in construction activity
and a falloff in expansion in retail sales. Bad weather and strikes
account for some of the weakness in construction, where employment
was dow by over 200,000 from its February high. The civil disturbances
played a significant role in holding down both retail sales and trade
employment in April, but there has been little indication of strength
since then and employment has been rising less rapidly than last
year.
Manufacturing employment, which averaged 19.7 million in
June, has risen by 115,000 from the turn of the year. Practically all
of the increase occurred in the nondurable goods sector, where apparel
has shown a good gain since January. Employment has not risen
appreciably in the durable goods sector, despite very high rates of steel
and auto production. Although the average workweek, at nearly 41 hours
in June, was still somewhat below the record levels of 1966, employers
have apparently met some of their recent labor needs by small increases
in the amount of overtime worked rather than by hiring.

II -24
Unemployment. After remaining steady in the first five months
of 1968, the unemployment rate jumped three-tenths of a point to 3.8 per
cent in June. The rise probably reflected a larger-than-seasonal summer
influx of younger workers into the labor market and may be a temporary
phenomenon. Because the survey week came soon after schools were
dismissed, fewer than usual of the 2.3 million teenage entrants had found
jobs. Their unemployment rate rose a full point to 13,6 per cent.
Reflecting the same adjustment problem, the unemployment rate for 20 to 24
year-olds rose from 5.3 per cent in May to 6.5 per cent in June.
Usually most youngsters find jobs by July, but slack in the over-all
market this summer could result in continued higher unemployment rates
for young workers.
Earnings. Reflecting the continued upward pressure on wage
rates, hourly earnings of rank-and-file workers on private payrolls
rose to a record $2.82 in the second quarter. The increase from a
year earlier amounted to 6 per cent, continuing to exceed the average
increases of recent years by a wide margin. The rise in hourly earn-
ings has been broadly distributed, with large increases in all major
industry groups. Despite persistent increases in the growth rate of
money earnings, "real" gains have remained small as consumer price
increases eroded dollar gains. In turn, the rapid rise in prices has
contributed to the demands for higher wages.

* Preliminary estimate.
But several forces pushing up the general wage level--a tight
labor market, higher minimum wages, and a large number of important
contract negotiations in durable goods manufacturing-- will diminish
somewhat in importance this fall and winter and should allow some
moderation in earning increases by early 1969. Wage pressures will
not ease immediately because rising unemployment typically does not
loosen the labor market quickly enough to ease entry-level wage pressure
for several quarters, and sizable built-in annual wage increases and
escalator-clause raises will continue in many industries, although they
will be somewhat smaller than in 1968 because of the recent tendency
to provide smaller increases in later years of contracts. A further

II -26
rise in minimum wages in some industries will occur next February,
but it will be much more limited than those that became effective
in 1967 and 1968.
Although wage increases should moderate as fiscal restraint
takes hold later this year, the rise in unit labor costs will probably
continue, reflecting the difficulty of adapting labor input--especially
overhead labor--to a slower pace in output growth, particularly when
the slowdown is expected to be temporary. Coupled with the tax
increase, this rising cost pressure suggests a corporate profit squeeze
and additional strong efforts to cut costs and boost productivity.
Consumer prices. In May, the consumer price index rose 0.3
per cent to 120.3 per cent of the 1957-59 average, as prices of nondurable
goods and consumer services moved higher. The increase over the year
was 4.1 per cent.
Grocery prices continued upward at a rapid pace. Fruits and
vegetables increased more than usual as a result of late harvests,
weather damage to crops, and smaller carry-over stocks. The earlier
increase in the support price for milk pushed up retail prices of
dairy products sharply, and meats rose contraseasonally. During the
first 5 months of the year prices of food for home use increased at
an annual rate of 6 per cent (nearly 8 per cent after allowance for
seasonal changes). Prices of restaurant meals increased 0.5 per cent
in May and at an annual rate of 5 per cent from last December to May.

II -27
Apparel prices continued their strong upward trend in May,
with a rise of 0.9 per cent, 3 times the usual seasonal increase for
the month; summer wear for women and girls led the advance. The
year-over-year rise in apparel prices continued much larger at retail
(5,3 per cent) than at wholesale (3.4 per cent). Retail prices of
women's and girl's clothing were up 6 per cent from a year earlier;
this rise is half as large as the net increase over the preceding
20 years.
Prices of fuel oil showed an unusual increase for this time
of year especially on the East coast, as seasonal discounts were
skipped by distributors. Retail prices of gasoline declined slightly
and were about the same as a year earlier. At wholesale, prices of
gasoline in May were nearly 6 per cent below May 1967 but a sharp
increase in June has apparently largely eliminated this gap.
In contrast to nondurable goods, average prices of durable
goods were unchanged for the month. New car prices were maintained
although some seasonal decline is expected. Used car prices increased
less than seasonally despite a firm market for good later model
cars. Furniture prices continued to rise.
The rise for consumer services, which had slowed appreciably
in April, picked up somewhat in May, to 0.4 per cent, or about the
average monthly increase over the past year. Medical care services
rose another 0.5 per cent in May as doctors' and dentists' fees
increased 0.3 per cent and hospital service charges nearly 1 per cent.
The April and May increases for medicare, however, were somewhat

II -28
smaller than in earlier months. Personal care services, largely barber
and beauty shop services, were up substantially--by 0.7 per cent--
continuing the acceleration evident over the past year.
Wholesale prices. Industrial prices resumed their upward
trend in June. The sharp drop for sensitive materials--notably
copper--which slowed the rise in the BLS industrial average in April
and then precipitated an 0.2 per cent decline in May, slackened appre-
ciably in June. With average prices of other industrial commodities
continuing upward, the BLS estimates an 0.2 per cent rise in their
industrial price index last month.
Along with the especially large decline in copper and copper
and brass mill prices in May (about 12 per cent), the total number of
price increases reported represented only 40 per cent of all industrial
product classes, and preliminary estimates for June indicate an even
lower proportion for increases and an excess of the number showing
no change over increases for the first time since last September.
The current relatively small proportion of increases represents a
considerable let-down from January and February, when increases were
being reported for 57 per cent and when the industrial price average
was rising by 0.4 per cent per month.
Sensitive industrial materials declined only an estimated
0.2 per cent further in June, following a 2 per cent decline from
their March peak to May. Prices of brass and wire mill products were
reduced sharply further in early June, steel scrap continued to recede,

II -29
and hide prices declined. But prices of aluminum ingot and most mill
products were boosted 4 per cent, following the large wage settlement,
and lumber and plywood prices continued to rise although at a much
slower pace than last winter. The reduction in basic copper prices-
and perhaps also steel scrap--appears to be largely over (although
price cuts for some copper end-products have been announced in recent
weeks,) Average prices of sensitive industrial materials may tend to
show little change for a few months unless the lumber price rise is
reversed with the expected cuts in residential construction activity;
in that event sensitive material prices are likely to resume a
decline.
The estimated June rise for industrial commodities other than
sensitive materials was 0,2 per cent--larger than in May and close to
the average monthly increase prevailing since last summer, However,
nearly half the June rise for this broad category reflected a sharp
spurt in gasoline prices (partly seasonal and partly in response to
earlier strength in retail demand--and prices.) In addition to
gasoline, price increases were reported last month for apparel, man-
made textile fiber products, and various building materials other than
lumber. Lower prices were posted for paper and paperboard products,
household appliances, and television sets.

The May rise for farm product prices was somewhat sharper than
had been estimated earlier, and, despite the industrial price decline,
the total BLS wholesale price index increased 0.2 per cent. In June,
prices of foods and foodstuffs were about unchanged and the WPI rose
an estimated 0.2 per cent further--to 108.7 per cent of the 1957-59
average, This level is 2.3 per cent above a year earlier, with farm
products and processed foods and feeds up 1.1 per cent and industrial
commodities up 2.6 per cent.
Farm prices. Prices received in the first half of 1968
averaged nearly 3 per cent above a year earlier, Prices of livestock
and products were up 2 per cent, bolstered by stronger prices for
cattle and broilers and a boost of 7 per cent in dairy price supports
effective April 1. Crop prices were up 3 per cent. Crop prices are
not likely to stray far from price-support loan rates if the excellent

II -31
yield prospects at home and in many countries abroad are realized.
Prices of livestock products are likely to stay well above year
earlier levels, reflecting strong consumer demands and per capita
supplies of meats only a little larger than a year earlier in the
summer and a little smaller in the fall.

Prices paid. Prices paid by farmers so far in 1968 have
averaged more than 3 per cent above a year earlier. Items used in
production rose least; while interest, taxes, and wage rates increased
the most from a year ago, showing the biggest rise since 1957-59.
Interest on mortgage debt per acre increased 8 per cent from the
first half of 1967 and was 173 per cent above the 1957-59 average;
real estate taxes per acre were up 7 per cent and nearly double the
1957-59 average. The family living component averaged 4 per cent above
last year.
Parity ratio. With prices paid advancing at a little more
rapid rate than prices received, the parity ratio (1910-14 = 100) has
averaged lower so far in 1968 than at any time since the upswing in
farm prices in mid-1965.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL SITUATION
Bank credit. Total loans and investments at all commercial
banks (month-end series) expanded at a very low 1.0 per cent annual
rate in June, less than one-sixth the rate of growth over the first
five months of the year. This slowdown reflects principally a reduction
of security holdings at banks, as business loans increased at more than
twice the pace of last month. (Measured on a daily average basis by the
proxy, outstanding bank credit in June was 8.5 per cent, at an annual
rate, above its average level in May, after including the sharp increase
in Euro-dollar borrowing during recent weeks.)

Holdings of Government securities fell approximately $700
million at all commercial banks during June, representing in large part
liquidation of Treasury bills as well as some continued selling of the

III -2
15-month notes acquired in the May financing. With tight reserve
positions and constrained deposit inflows, banks have reduced substan-
tially their bill holdings in recent months in order to meet loan
demands. Since the first of the year large banks have liquidated about
$3.7 billion of Treasury bills.
For the same reasons, banks have reduced their holdings of
other securities recently, particularly short-term municipals. With
the $100 million liquidation in June, banks holdings of these securities
showed a small decline over the second quarter, compared with almost a
14 per cent annual rate of increase in the first quarter.
After a temporary slowdown in May, business loans resumed
expansion at near the higher rate of growth that began in mid-March.
The June increase was fairly widespread among industry categories,
although borrowing by durable goods manufacturers remained heavy and
could reflect financing for inventory accumulation by steel-using
industries in light of a possible steel strike this summer. Direct
corporate borrowing to meet tax and dividend payments also appears to
have accounted for some of the June increase in business loans. While
below June of last year, the growth of business loans around the tax
date was above comparable periods in other recent years. The following
table summarizes changes in business loans and related items at large
banks during the June tax and dividend period for the past several years.

Real estate loans at all commercial banks in June expanded
at the somewhat slower pace of the previous month, probably reflecting
the unwillingness of banks to make long-term commitments in view of
their reduced deposit inflows. The June increase in consumer loans,
however, matched the more rapid rate of growth in May as automobile
sales remained strong.

III -4
Bank deposits. Time and savings deposits at all commercial
banks are estimated to have expanded at about a 3.2 per cent annual
rate in June, on a daily average basis, approximately the same increase
as in May. The low rate of growth in June partly reflects a much more
than usual reduction in time deposits held by State and local governments
and by foreign institutions. State and local governments are reported to
be drawing down liquid assets, including time deposits, in response to
heavy expenditures and the high costs of market financing.

Although outstanding CD's at large banks declined about $280
million in June, pressure on CD's seems to have eased somewhat recently
and banks were able to attract a large quantity of these funds in late
June and early July. With Treasury bill rates well below Regulation Q
ceilings on all maturities by the end of the month, some large New York
banks reduced their offering rates to 6.00 per cent on longer-term CD's.
Moreover, offering rates on all maturities in the secondary market fell
from 15 to 25 basis points during June. Consequently, in the last week
in June, large banks were able to recover over one-half of the about-
normal $440 million decline in CD's that occurred during the mid-month
tax and dividend period, and banks in New York and Chicago added another
$223 million to their outstandings in the first week of July.
Consumer-type time and savings deposits continued to expand
in June at approximately the moderate pace of last month, but the com-
position and location of the recent increase was very different from
that in May. Savings deposits accounted for a larger share of the
growth in these deposits during June, increasing at about three times
the rate in May. In addition, much more of the increase in total
consumer-type time and savings deposits took place at banks in the
large financial centers. These deposits continued to expand--by $29
million at banks in New York and Chicago during the week ending July 3,
in sharp contrast to declines in recent past years during this first
week following the midyear interest crediting period. However, all of
the increase last week reflects a gain of $65 million in time certifi-
cates and open accounts which more than offset a reduction in outstanding
savings deposits at these banks.

III -6
With moderate deposit inflows and the recent expansion in
loan demand, banks continued to rely heavily on the Euro-dollar market
as a source of funds in June. Bank liabilities to foreign branches,
although below the record May expansion, increased approximately $600
million on a monthly average basis.
The money stock, on a daily average basis, is estimated to
have expanded at a 7.7 per cent rate in June, down from the rapid 11.7
per cent increase of last month. This reduced rate of expansion
reflects a slower growth in private demand deposits--at about one-half
the May pace--as U.S. Government deposits at banks showed a slight
increase for the first time since February. Over the entire first
half, the money stock expanded at a 6.6 per cent annual rate, with
nearly one-half of this growth occurring during April and May when
reductions in U.S. Government deposits were the heaviest.
Nonbank depositary institutions. Based on available data
for the early days of the reinvestment period, outflows from savings
and loan associations were only somewhat larger than during the similar
period of 1967, while the largest New York City mutual savings banks
had "adjusted" outflows about twice as large as the comparable period
of last year.
At the savings and loans, the relatively favorable experience
during the 3-day grace period was rather uniform by region; on the West
Coast, outflows were only marginally greater than last year.- For the
1/ Data for the last 3 days of June 1966 are not available. However,
since outflows reached a record in the first 10 days of July of that
year, it can be assumed that during the June grace period of 1966
outflows were much larger than in 1967 or 1968.

III -7
first 5 days of the reinvestment period,2/ New York City savings banks
had sizable net withdrawals, a large part of which was predictable from
the unprecedented passbook loan activity throughout the second quarter.
Adjusting net withdrawals for depositors' repayment of passbook loans--
which were, in effect, withdrawals of funds at the time the passbook
loans were made--provides a better measure of the recent experience of
the savings banks. As comparison of these "adjusted" outflows, shown
in the table, suggests the savings banks have not done as well as the
savings and loans so far during the reinvestment period, although their
outflows have not been as heavy as in 1966.

Note: Above data exclude dividends and interest credited. This
survey was first taken for the first 5 days in July 1966.
Mutual savings bank trade sources indicate no special concern
about their outflows, and it can be assumed that the savings and loans
now are likely to act with some assurance toward their loan demands.
However, it remains possible that developments over the balance of the
reinvestment period may--as in the previous two quarters--tend to aggra-
vate the final savings and loan results for this dividend crediting
period. Thus, it would be premature to derive results for the entire
month of July from the data now available.
Consistent with the evidence available so far for the rein-
vestment period, preliminary indications are that inflows for the month

II -9
of June moderated at mutual savings banks and accelerated at savings
and loans. (The mutual savings bank June data are preliminary, and
confidential until July 11.) The moderation of inflows at mutuals in
June is probably related to the heavy month-end withdrawals, part of
which reflected repayment of passbook loans.

after passage of the fiscal package was assured and as savings
experience, at least during the initial days of the reinvestment period,
proved less unfavorable than the thrift industry had been prepared to
meet.
In FNMA's weekly auctions--an indicator of expectations in
the FHA-VA sector of the market--yields on Government underwritten
home loans for future delivery to FNMA turned down after the middle of
last month, although they were higher at the end of June than at the
end of May. By July 8, implicit yields on FNMA's 6-month forward pur-
chase commitments, while still close to earlier postwar highs, had
declined further to the lowest level in 8 weeks, as the table shows.

Demands for residential mortgage credit--especially in the
dominant conventional loan sector--have continued to press against
supply in spite of the sharp increases in mortgage rates earlier this
year. Moreover, average yield spreads between home mortgages and new
issues of high-grade corporate bonds improved appreciably through May
from the March low, as the table shows, with some further improvement
likely during June as a whole. While the wider yield spreads have
particularly enhanced the attractiveness of FHA and VA home mortgages,
a quick return to large discounts on these loans has continued to
inhibit some builders and sellers from entering into transactions
financed with this type of credit. As a result, indications are that
home buyers during June were resorting even more than before to assump-
tions of existing mortgages and purchases under installment sales
contracts.

activity, particularly as lender uncertainty has arisen about what
types of loan charges are legal under legislation which has not yet
been tested in the courts.
During May, there was a decline in total outstanding resi-
dential mortgage commitments reported by lenders, as shown in the
table, following an upturn earlier in the spring. The backlog of
mortgage commitments to be taken down in coming months remained quite
high relative to the recent average cash flow position of the thrift
institutions.

Life insurance companies-policy loans. Policy loan activity
at life insurance companies has increased so far in 1968, as shown in
the table below. In fact, the sharp increase during May was exceeded
only in the late summer and fall of 1966. To some extent, an upward
trend in these loans can be expected as policyholder cash values increase,
but the sharp further increase during May is explainable mainly by the
high relative cost of borrowing elsewhere and the attractive yields
available on alternative investments.

Corporate and municipal bond markets. Since passage of the

the lack of appropriate corporate issues produced a break in our new

did show an upward adjustment in free market yields that week. For
example, the release of the Ohio Bell Telephone Aaa-rated bonds to free
market trading on July 2--when 75 per cent of the issue remained unsold
after two weeks--resulted in an immediate upward yield adjustment to a
level about 5 basis points above that prevailing on similar issues in
mid-May. Municipal yields early in July were about 5 basis points
below their mid-May level reached immediately preceding the market's
reaction to the May delay in deliberations of the tax bill. Although
municipal yields recently have evidenced relative stability, some upward
rate pressure appears to be building up in this market.

While uncertainty over the future course of monetary policy
and a probable underestimate by market participants of the degree of
economic restraint incorporated in the fiscal package have played a
role in recent yield developments, most market attention seems to be
devoted to the large near-term volume of bond financing. In both
corporate and municipal markets the sizable June pace of offerings will
likely be maintained at least through July. During the last week of
June alone, more than $500 million of corporate offerings scheduled for
July were announced. New municipal issues also continue to be announced
in volume and industrial revenue bonds again began to enter the market.
The maintenance of new issue volume apparently reflects the announcement
of issues in the planning stage for some time.
The volume of corporate public bond offerings in June is
estimated to have aggregated $1.35 billion, the largest since October
1967. In addition, new stock offerings are estimated at about $450
million, also the largest total since October. Privately placed bond
issues, however, are expected to have been about $700 million, somewhat
less than estimated earlier. The downward revision in estimated private
placements for June (and earlier months) is attributable to continued
slow year-to-year growth in takedowns of commitments, the reasons for
which are not completely clear. The slow growth does not appear to be
primarily related to life insurance company activity, but rather may
reflect both the relative pull of attractively priced public bonds and
increased purchases of equities by pension funds. Nevertheless, the
aggregate volume of corporate security financing in June is estimated
at $2.5 billion, the largest since the record financing volume during
the summer of 1967.

It was noted in the last Greenbook that the void in the July
calendar evident at that time might be quickly filled if a sizable
volume of rumored industrial issues materialized. This has, in fact,
occurred and the staff now estimates an ultimate July volume of public
corporate offerings of about $1.3 billion, or just slightly below June.
An estimated decline in stock offerings as well as a seasonal drop in
private placements will likely hold aggregate security offerings to
about $2.1 billion, significantly below June.
In the municipal market, the volume of new issues continues
large. During June more than $1.3 billion of bonds were marketed--
including about $150 million of industrial revenue issues--and a similar
volume is estimated for July. However, a sizable portion of the

III -18
municipal bonds that were offered at reduced yields late in June
remained in syndicate early in July. These undistributed issues, con-
tinued limited bank participation, and a large forward calendar have
contributed to the upward yield pressures noted above.

Stock market. Common stock prices drifted lower during the
latter half of June and early July, while trading volume showed some
moderation. Nonetheless, early in the second week of July, price
indices--having then rebounded--were above their historic highs of
June 11, and volume since mid-June had been heavy by any but the most
recent standards. Indeed with back office problems still not resolved,
four-day trading weeks, originally scheduled to end the first week in
July, will now continue through the end of the month.

Despite the recent price advances, the market as a whole has
shown no great enthusiasm in response to the passage of the tax bill.
This lack of enthusiasm may reflect continued uncertainty about monetary
policy and the effect of fiscal restraint on the economic outlook in
general, and corporate profits in particular. Moreover, the recentIndustrial ... nvrp Ex a I ..... nde Exchange.... In......

increase in margin requirements--especially by increasing the number of
restricted accounts--may have dampened speculative enthusiasm. However,
even OTC stocks--not subject to margin requirements--also appear to have
been affected by the slowing of the advance of equity prices.
Data now available for May indicate that open-end investment
companies made a record commitment of $564 million to the stock market in
that month. In addition, borrowed funds continued to flow into the market
in May at a rapid rate. Brokers' margin customers increased their debt by
$180 million (preliminary) to a record level of $6.6 billion in May.
(Revised figures indicate a record margin debt increase in April of $250
million.) Purpose loans by large weekly reporting banks rose by only $10
million during the month, and total stock market credit stood at roughly
$9 billion at the end of May. "Paper profits" available in special miscel-
laneous accounts at brokerages also rose sharply during the month to a new
high of $6,350 million (preliminary). Under the 80 per cent margin require-
ments now in effect, these balances were available to purchase roughly $8
billion in stocks without the deposit of additional cash.
Incomplete data suggest that brokers' margin customers increased
their debt at a somewhat slower rate in June. Some of this slowdown
undoubtedly reflected the higher level of margin requirements announced in
early June. These higher requirements also shifted about $2.8 billion of
accounts into "restricted" status. Such accounts cannot generate "paper
profits" eligible to be reserved in special miscellaneous accounts until
collateral values have risen sufficiently to make the account once again
unrestricted.-
1/ When adjusted debt is 20 per cent or less of collateral values, the
account is "unrestricted"; it is, otherwise, "restricted."

U.S. Government securities market. Yields on most U.S. Govern-
ment securities have moved erratically since the last FOMC meeting but
on balance have declined moderately. Yields are generally now 50 to 75
basis points below the levels reached in the third week of May, when they
reached a peak in reflection of pessimistic expectations of enactment
of fiscal restraint.

Just prior to and immediately after passage of the fiscal pro-
gram, a fairly firm tone developed in the Government securities market.
This tone was short-lived, however; and dealers soon expressed dis-
appointment over the lack of expected demand, especially in the note
and bond sector, and there was a moderate increase in yields through-
out the list.

III -22
Demand in the coupon area of the Government market has picked
up somewhat in the last 10 days. This has resulted from increased bank
swapping into longer maturities and decreased dealer profit-taking, which
had caused some professional pressure on prices earlier. Both of these
developments suggest that the market may be beginning to react to pros-
pects of easier monetary conditions. In addition, there was fair-sized
demand from the System which bought coupon issues outright on a couple
of days, in amounts totaling around $200 million.
A large part of the demand for bills in the latter half of
June stemmed from seasonal factors, such as reinvestment of June tax
bills not turned in for taxes, bank buying for mid-year statement
purposes and System reserve-supplying operations in connection with
the currency drains associated with the July 4 holiday. During the
period the System also purchased a sizable amount of bills to offset
the effects of the British IMF drawing and other official international
transactions.
Most bill demand was concentrated in shorter-term bills with
the result that dealer trading positions in that category were sharply
reduced. Thus yields on bills due in 3 months or less fell sharply,
with the 3-month bill going as low as 5.20 per cent--30 basis points
below the discount rate--in the third week of June.
Bill yields have backed up moderately on balance in the last
two weeks with reversal of bank demands for year-end statement purposes
and a larger over-all supply of new bills.

III -23
The Treasury auctioned $4 billion of tax-anticipation bills
on July 2, with $2 billion each of March and April 1969 maturities;
commercial banks were allowed to pay for the bills by 100 per cent
crediting of tax and loan accounts. Bidding for the tax bills was some-
what more aggressive than expected. Bank interest in the bills has
continued, and to date they apparently have been less anxious than usual
to sell their awards into the secondary market.
Other short-term rates have also shown some indications of
moving lower since the last Committee meeting. Nonetheless, the changes
are scattered, and most of these yields have not declined to the same
extent as Treasury bills.

Federal finance. While final data on the fiscal year 1968
Budget will not be available until the end of July, preliminary
estimates by the Board's staff indicate that the Budget deficit ex-
ceeded $24 billion (see table). Budget receipts are estimated at
close to $153.5 billion, only slightly larger than the Budget Document
forecast, after the latter is adjusted for the delay in surtax legisla-
tion. Individual income tax collections, however, were greater than
estimated and corporate taxes less. Personal tax refunds, after being
unusually large in the first five months of calendar year 1968, declined
sharply in June, indicating faster processing of tax returns than in
previous years.

1/ Original Budget Document figures have been adjusted by eliminating

Vietnam defense spending as announced by the President.
2/ Original Budget Document receipts have been adjusted to shift surtax
and acceleration collections from FY 1968 to FY 1969 (except a $0.2
billion decrease in corporate acceleration due to changed legislation).
Original Budget Document outlays have been adjusted (1) to incorporate
the legislated $6.0 billion spending cut, (2) to add $2.6 billion to
Vietnam defense spending as announced by President, (3) to allocate
contingency funds for July 1968 Federal pay raise as between defense
and all other outlays.
e -estimated on basis of preliminary data.

III -26
Budget outlays for FY 1968 are estimated at close to $178
billion, roughly in line with the Budget forecast after adjusting the
latter for $2.5 billion additional Vietnam spending as announced by
the President at the end of March.
A rough picture of the fiscal year 1969 outlook can be ob-
tained by making specific adjustments to the original Budget Document.
Relative to the original forecast, (1) receipts will increase because
the delay in the passage of the surtax increases retroactive tax
collections during fiscal year 1969, (2) outlays will be reduced due
to the legislated $6.0 billion spending cut, and (3) outlays for
exempted Vietnam spending will be increased by $2.6 billion as was
also announced by the President at the end of March. When these ad-
justments are incorporated into the 1969 Budget, a deficit of $2.1
billion is obtained. It may be noted that these adjusted forecasts
are based on an assumed GNP of $846 million in calendar year 1968.
During the current month, the issue of $4.0 billion of tax
bills on July 11, and weekly increases of $100 million in 6 month
bill issues, should provide for financing of the large--partly seasonal--
cash deficit and, in addition, should lift the Treasury cash balance
by an estimated $0.9 billion. Accordingly, the end of July cash
operating balance is estimatedat $6.2 billion. These estimates
incorporate receipts of $1.1 billion for a special retroactive tax
payment by corporations on July 15--a result of the surtax law.
In August, the Treasury will need to refinance maturing
coupon issues and, also to raise about $3.0 billion of additional funds.

unspecified. No further borrowing operations--other than the
scheduled weekly additions to 6-month bill issues--will be required
in September, and an excess of tax receipts over expenditures during
that month should allow the Treasury to enter the fourth quarter of
seasonal deficits with a substantially enlarged balance.

Recent exchange market developments. Both France and
Britain experienced large reserve losses in late June and early July,
and their currencies touched new lows in foreign exchange markets.
There were rumors that the French franc would be devalued, despite
Gaullist election victories and the announcement of temporary import
restrictions and export subsidies to defend the present parity. Ster-
ling was affected by these rumors and by pessimism over recent U.K.
trade and reserve figures and labor difficulties.
Apparently most of the funds transferred out of sterling
and French franc assets during this periodwere invested in U.S. dol-
lar assets -- Euro-dollar deposits, Euro-bonds, U.S. corporate stocks,
and other claims on the United States. While the Swiss franc exchange
rate was very strong, Swiss reserve gains were modest. The German
mark fluctuated close to par against the dollar.
Early this week, sterling showed a considerable recovery,
on news that 12 countries including the United States had committed

IV -2
themselves at a B.I.S. meeting to provide up to $2 billion of medium-
term financing for Britain to cover declines in the sterling holdings
of sterling area countries. Settlement of a British railway labor
dispute with only a minor breach of the Government's wage guidelines
also contributed to sterling's recovery. By Wednesday, July 10, the
sterling rate had rebounded to about $2.3880, its highest level since
mid-May, and the forward discount on 3-month sterling had narrowed
to about 4 per cent per annum, lowest since mid-June.
However, the market has been very thin. Whether this week's
sterling recovery will hold, and perhaps mark the long-awaited turning
point, will depend importantly on the U.K. foreign trade figures for
June, scheduled to be released on July 11.
The French franc has been under less severe selling pressure
in recent days, thanks to further Gaullist victories in the second
round of the national elections, and to the announcement of new poli-
cies to contain domestic inflation. These actions included an increase
in the Bank of France discount rate from 3-1/2 to 5 per cent, effective
July 3 (with exceptions, however, for export paper and small business),
and an announcement that new taxes of some sort will be imposed in
September. However, France has continued to lose reserves, bringing
total losses to date to about $2 billion, and while the authorities
hope to stop the outward flight of capital soon and have announced
that they are strengthening the temporary exchange controls imposed

IV -3
at the end of May, no significant reflow should be expected until
the French economy has demonstrated a capacity to absorb the recent
large wage increases without lasting damage to its international
competitive position.
Gold. The free market price of gold in London and Zurich
remained remarkably steady near $41 an ounce during late June and
early July as traders awaited a resolution of problems connected
with the marketing of South African gold. Upon rumors that a com-
promise was being reached under which South Africa would sell most
of its new production in free markets but with assurance of central
bank or IMF purchases if the free market price should drop to $35
an ounce, the price declined to $39.80 on Tuesday, July 9, but rose
above $40 on Wednesday.
The monetary authorities of sterling area countries con-
tinued to buy small amounts of gold from the United States through
early July. So far this year, through July 9, nine countries that
hold their foreign exchange reserves mainly in sterling had purchased
a total of about $220 million (apart from purchases for payment to
the IMF). A number of non-sterling countries have also made gold
purchases recently, or signified their intention to do so. But
thanks to substantial sales by France, the total U.S. gold stock
increased by $213 million in June (CONFIDENTIAL until publication
of Treasury Bulletin for July), and will probably show a further
increase in July.

IV -4
U.S. balance of payments. Preliminary data indicate that
the seasonally adjusted liquidity deficit in the second quarter before
special transactions was somewhat larger than the $900 million deficit
in the first quarter. However, special financial transactions were
very large, over $900 million; so the liquidity deficit on the pub-
lished basis was small -- probably less than $200 million, compared
with $600 million in the first quarter.
Special transactions during the second quarter consisted
mainly of Canadian and German purchases of nonconvertible Treasury
notes, including $125 million of such notes sold to German commercial
banks under the new agreement to offset U.S. foreign exchange outlays
related to maintaining U.S. troops in Germany. This agreement also
calls for the Bundesbank to purchase, in fiscal 1969, $500 million
of U.S. Treasury notes in quarterly instalments, as in fiscal 1968,
and for the German Government again to buy $100 million of U.S.
military equipment.
The balance in the second quarter benefited from two
unusual transactions (not included in special transactions) as
mentioned in the last Green Book: (1) redemption of $150 million
of maturing IBRD securities held by U.S. residents, and (2) a
direct investment inflow of $50 million from a group of European
banks.

IV -5
The balance on the official reserve transactions basis in
the second quarter will show a very large surplus -- perhaps as much
as $1-1/2 billion, seasonally adjusted -- compared with a deficit of
about $500 million in the first quarter. The surplus in the second
quarter reflected a record inflow of funds from foreign branches of
U.S. banks of nearly $2 billion, about double the inflow in the first
quarter. Shifts of funds out of French francs and sterling probably
contributed importantly to this inflow, and these shifts cannot be
expected to continue long at recent rates.
The U.S. export surplus on goods and services seems to have
recovered very little in the second quarter from the low first quarter
annual rate of $1.5 billion. There was probably some increase in net
outflows of U.S. private capital, which had fallen to an unusually
low level in the first quarter under the influence of the new re-
straint programs. On the other hand, outflows of U.S. Government
grants and loans are thought to have diminished, and inflows of
foreign private capital into U.S. corporate stocks and Euro-bond
issues rose to new highs. Some of these developments are discussed
in detail below.
U.S. foreign trade. For the second time in three months,
merchandise imports exceeded exports in May. While the import balance
in March was attributable to the New York port strike, the trade deficit

IV -6
in May does not appear to have reflected any such unusual event but
rather stems from a renewed advance in imports while exports receded
from the strike-inflated shipments in April. For the three months of
March-May combined (which eliminates the effect of the strike on March-
April trade), the export surplus (balance of payments basis) was
virtually nil, and was far below even the low rates of the first two
months of the year and the closing quarter of last year.
Exports in March-May were at an annual rate of $32.0 billion
(balance of payments basis), about 3 per cent below the rate in the
first two months of the year. Shipments of both agricultural and non-
agricultural products fell during the past three months; the rate of
decline in agricultural commodities, however, was twice that for
nonagricultural goods. The drop in agricultural exports stemmed
from lower commercial sales of wheat. A slackening in the rate of
deliveries in aircraft accounted for most of the dip in shipments of
nonagricultural products.
Exports to all major regions except the EEC countries of
Europe fell or showed little change in the March-May period. The
heaviest declines were in shipments to Canada and to Asian countries
other than Japan. Exports to EEC countries increased slightly but
it is still too soon to determine whether this is the beginning of
the long-awaited improvement in sales of these countries.

IV -7
It is expected that U.S. exports in the second half of the
year will receive some stimulus from implementation on July 1, by the
United Kingdom, the EEC countries and Japan, of 40 per cent of the
tariff reductions negotiated in the Kennedy Round. On that same date,
the common external tariff of the Common Market countries became
effective. Consequently, the average rate of duty on imports of
industrial products dropped substantially in France and Italy, with
a much more moderate decline in German and the Benelux countries.
The recent imposition of quotas on some imports for six months by
France may tend to offset some of the reduction in its duty rates;
but the quotas permit imports of 7-15 per cent larger quantities
than a year earlier; and U.S. exports to France of the items af-
fected by these quotas -- steel, automobiles, textiles, household
appliances -- are relatively small, less than 5 per cent of total
shipments to that country in 1967.
Imports in May increased, after remaining fairly stable
during the first four months of the year. (Imports in March and
April did not appear to be much affected by the port strike in March).
For April-May combined, imports were about 3 per cent greater than the
very high rate of the first quarter, and 22 per cent larger than a
year earlier. Purchases of cars from Europe and Japan, steel, heavy
electrical machinery, coffee, sugar and apparel were all up sharply
in April-May. Imports of cars from Canada were little change from
the high rate of the first quarter.

IV -8
Arrivals of cars, other than from Canada, were particularly
heavy in April-May, increasing by more than 25 per cent over the first
quarter rate. Sales of such cars in the United States are near an
annual rate of one million units and stocks are being increased to
meet this heavy demand. Purchases of foreign apparel also expanded
further and imports of gem diamonds increased.
The continuing rise in coffee and sugar imports since the
beginning of the year largely reflects the need to replenish inven-
tories. The removal of the quarterly allocation for sugar imports in
early April resulted in heavy arrivals of sugar which ordinarily would
not have been imported until later in the year.
Imports of industrial materials in total showed little
change in April-May from the first quarter rate. Copper imports in
May finally turned down sharply as U.S. refineries expanded their
output following the ending of the strike last March. Arrivals of
aluminum in April-May also fell as the threat of a strike receded
when agreement was reached on a new labor contract. On the other
hand, a further increase in the value of iron and steel imports in
April-May -- to a rate nearly 60 per cent above a year earlier --
just about offset the drop in the value of aluminum and copper
imports.

IV -9
Bank-reported claims. Claims on foreigners reported by
banks in the United States declined little further in April-May
after dropping sharply in the first quarter by $416 million ($360
million, seasonally adjusted). Claims subject to the Federal Reserve
restraint program, which represent a somewhat more narrowly defined
category, were down by more -- $525 million for the 5 months through
May. Probably little further reflow is to be expected during the
remainder of the year.
The decline in bank-reported claims through May was geo-
graphically widespread. There were declines of $149 million in
claims on Europe, $128 million in claims on Latin America, $119
million in claims on Canada, and $76 million in claims on Japan.

Securities transactions. U.S. purchases of newly issued
foreign securities, mainly Canadian, increased to nearly $500 million

IV -10
in the second quarter, seasonally adjusted, compared with less than
$400 million in the first. Redemptions in the second quarter, however,
were unusually large, reflecting the maturing of $150 million of IBRD
bonds mentioned above; and net purchases of outstanding foreign securi-
ties apparently diminished. Hence the net outflow of U.S. funds into
foreign securities was probably somewhat smaller than in the first
quarter.
Foreign purchases of U.S. corporate securities reached
record proportions in the second quarter. Net purchases of equities
came to $260 million in April and $80 million in May; they probably
exceeded $400 million in the second quarter as a whole. For the first
half year, such foreign purchases approached the previous record total
for a full year -- $800 million in 1967.
In addition, U.S. corporations sold a record amount -- more
than $600 million -- of convertible Euro-bonds in the second quarter
to finance direct investments abroad. They had sold $500 million in
the first quarter, compared with only $450 million in the full year
1967. An additional $100 million of offerings have already been
announced for July, but it is expected that total offerings in the
second half year will be much smaller than in the first half. Only
a small portion -- perhaps one-fourth -- of the proceeds of Euro-
bond issues during the first half year have yet been transferred
to foreign affiliates. Most of the remainder is being held as
Euro-dollar deposits for future use.

IV -11
Direct investments. The new mandatory control program for
U.S. direct investments had a marked effect in the first quarter.
There was a sharp drop in capital outflows for direct investment
abroad, to $470 million, seasonally adjusted, compared with a quar-
terly average of $750 million in 1967. The $470 million figure in-
cludes about $90 million of funds that had been borrowed abroad
through security issues. In addition, as described above, U.S.
corporations borrowed very large sums abroad for future use in
financing direct investments.
There had been some expectation, even before imposition
of the new controls, that outflows of U.S. direct investment capital
this year would be no higher than last year, in view of the projected
slackening in the rate of increase in plant and equipment expenditures
by foreign affiliates of U.S. firms. A survey taken in December 1967
indicated that such outlays might increase 6 per cent this year, follow-
ing increases of 9 per cent in 1967, 16 per cent in 1966, and 21 per
cent in 1965.
With the new program in effect, it is now anticipated that
outflows of direct investment capital will be smaller than last year,
perhaps $2-1/2 billion instead of $3 billion, and of the $2-1/2 bil-
lion, roughly $1 billion may be financed by the use of funds borrowed
through security issues abroad, as compared with less than $300 million

IV -12
so financed in 1967. Thus, outflows net of such foreign financing
may be cut by more than $1 billion. They will not, however, remain
as low as during the first quarter; the unusually small outflows in
that quarter reflected the initial confusion and delays right after
the controls were first announced.

IV -13
Price and wage developments in major industrial countries.
Outside the United States, the most important price and wage developments
have been those connected with the recent upheaval in France and with
the struggle in the United Kingdom between the Government and trade
unions over incomes policy. Elsewhere, German wages have resumed a more
rapid advance after the 1967 pause, and the Canadian and Japanese price
and wage advances slowed down in the early months of the year.
The United Kingdom Government, striving to achieve a 2 per cent
reduction in real consumption expenditures from the second half of 1967
to the second half of 1968, is attempting to carry out a tough incomes
policy, limiting wage increases to an annual rate of 3-1/2 per cent.
The aim is to allow consumer prices to increase more rapidly than wage
rates, and if possible to prevent wages from increasing faster than
productivity.
From last November, when sterling was devalued, through March
of this year, wage advances just about equaled price increases. In
April, however, indirect taxes imposed in the budget resulted in a
very sharp rise in the consumer price index; following a further increase
in May that index stood at 1.9 per cent above the March level. During
the same period, wage rates increased very little, by only about a
quarter of one per cent. The continuation of these favorable develop-
ments will depend on the Government's determination to resist demands
from the labor unions.

IV -14
An important test of the incomes policy came in the latter
half of June, when the unions of railway workers commenced widespread
delaying tactics, working-to-rule, and complete rail stoppages at
weekends. The unions insisted on an across-the-board pay raise and
refused pay advances geared to productivity increases offered by the
Transport Commission. Contrary to its previous practice, the Government
refused to interfere in the dispute. Early in July, a settlement was
reached directly between the unions and the Transport Commission. An
across-the-board wage increase of about 3 per cent was granted immediately
with the lowest-paid workers getting 4-1/2 per cent. The unions and
the Commission will now enter into productivity agreement discussions
which must be concluded by September 2. Any further pay advances granted
as a result of these talks must absorb the pay raise already granted.
The agreement is a technical breach of the incomes policy but if meaningful
productivity agreements are negotiated and the additional pay increases
do not outstrip productivity gains, the settlement may be considered
a modest triumph for the Government's incomes policy.
A second major test of the toughness of the incomes policy
is the current deadlock in wage negotiations involving Britain's 2.5 mil-
lion engineering workers. In this case, also, the unions insist on a
centrally negotiated across-the-board wage increase and refuse to
accept management's proposals that pay raises be negotiated locally
and geared to productivity agreements.

IV- 15
These labor disputes are very important tests of the Wilson
Government's determination to enforce its incomes policy and their final
outcome will strongly influence developments in the British economy during
the next 12 months. Lax enforcement of incomes policy would accelerate
inflation and dissipate some of the price advantages of the devaluation;
overly rigid enforcement might lead to costly and disruptive strikes.
The recent labor disputes have contributed to the weakness of the pound
in foreign exchange markets.
Consumer prices in Britain rose 3 per cent during the first
5 months of 1968, and the Government's forecast that they will increase
by around 7 per cent during the full year 1968 seems reasonable. It
is doubtful whether wage increases can be kept rigidly within the
3-1/2 per cent target, but in view of actual and foreseen price increases,
wage rises in the range of 5 to 5-1/2 per cent might still be compatible
with the Government's stabilization and balance of payments goals.
A more distinct pattern in France is now emerging as the result
of the settlement of the general strike. French wholesale prices in
the first quarter of this year actually declined quite sharply, largely
as the result of the introduction of the value-added tax system. Perversely,
the introduction of this system at retail level caused consumer prices
to advance sharply in January following an equally sharp increase in
the last quarter of 1967, reflecting predominantly increased social

IV -16
security taxes and medical costs. In the meantime, French wage rate
increases continued to lag behind those of France's EEC partners and
unemployment reached about 2-1/2 per cent of the labor force in March.
The combination of these influences, coupled with strong
resentment of the Government's highhandedness in dealing with the labor
sector--from June to December last year the Government ruled by decree
and the Parliament was recessed--goes a long way to explain the nearly
catastrophic events of May and June in France. The Government and
the Employer's Association, obviously taken aback by the scope and
violence of events, agreed to grant very substantial wage and benefit
increases to all segments of the French labor force. The Government
also agreed to rescind, in some degree, medical benefit cuts passed by
decree in 1967. Following the unexpectedly overwhelming Gaullist victory
on June 23 and 30, the French authorities are now faced with the conflicting
problems of absorbing much higher wage costs and avoiding accelerating
inflation unduly while retaining the competitiveness of French export
products.
The June wage increases, exclusive of minor fringe benefits,
range between 10 and 15 per cent and appear to average about double the
rate that had been expected this year, before the unrest. The upward
push on costs and prices is going to be severe and the French Government
is attempting to limit price increases in several ways. First, the
Government budget deficit will absorb the higher deficits of nationalized
enterprises (mainly utilities and transportation) and no increase in
prices to consumers is expected for this year. Second, the Government

IV -17
expects to monitor closely price developments outside the public sector
and, in general, is determined to limit both wholesale and retail price
increases to 3 per cent during the second half of 1968; it is not clear
if this means a substantial tightening of the very moderate system of
price controls in force during the first half of this year. Third, the
Government has decided temporarily to assume part of the wage increases
in the export industries through a system of export subsidies, based
on labor content of exported goods. These rebates are estimated to equal
about 2-1/2 per cent of the total export price for the period July-October
and 1-1/2 per cent for the period November-January 1969, when the rebates
are scheduled to be terminated.
Our estimates, based on the data currently available, indicate
that unless very strict price controls are exercised, French consumer
prices may rise during this year by as much as 7-1/2 per cent. Such a
rate of price advances is apparently unacceptable to the French
authorities. However, too rigid price controls would cut sharply into
the already thin profit margin of most French enterprises and thus
further aggravate the unemployment situation.
Following a distinct pause in wage and price increases in 1967,
prices in Germany rose sharply in January 1968. The rise in holesale
prices was almost solely due to the introduction of the value-added tax
system and, in some cases, double taxation of year-end inventories.
From February to April, however, wholesale prices of industrial products
declined by 0.6 per cent as a result of seasonal reductions in the
price of heating oil and price-declines for non-ferrous metals after

IV -18
the end of the U.S. copper strike. Consumer prices also rose sharply
in January, when services were subjected to the value-added tax for
the first time and rent controls were relaxed in a number of areas.
From February to April, consumer price increases slowed down very
markedly.
German wage rates advanced quite slowly during the first
quarter of this year, but the tempo picked up recently in response to
continuing economic recovery and declining unemployment. In April,
contracts were negotiated for 4.5 million workers resulting in wage
increases of 5 per cent; this may be contrasted with average increases
of 3-1/2 per cent negotiated during the first quarter of the year.
In Italy, wages and prices are expected to continue along the
recent trends of 2 per cent per annum for prices and 3.7 per cent annually
for wages. No major wage negotiations are scheduled to take place in
Italy this year. Continuation of the present trends are dependent upon
industrial tranquility; reports from our Embassy in Rome indicate that
any unrest of the recent French type is unlikely.
There are signs that problems of wage and price inflation,
which troubled Canada since 1965, may now be easing. The unemployment
rate has recently increased to 4.9 per cent from 4.7 per cent at the
beginning of the year and the Government is pursuing a restrictive
fiscal policy. As is the case in the current labor disputes in the U.K.,
the Canadian Government is not interfering in labor disputes; in the

IV -19
past the authorities intervened in strikes of national importance
and allowed excessive wage settlements. Moreover, the Government is
contemplating introduction of a "forceful" incomes policy. At the
moment no details have been announced beyond the decision to establish
a Wages and Income Board in the near future.
The Canadian wholesale price index has been relatively steady
in recent months, although preliminary figures for May indicate an
increase of 0.6 per cent over the April level. There was no increase
in the consumer price index in May, following a gain of 3.5 per cent
between December and April. Canadian wage rates increased by 8.3 per
cent in 1967, but the rate of increase appears to have slowed down in
1968. Our tentative estimates indicate that consumer prices may
increase by about 3.5 per cent this year and that wage increases may
be held down to slightly over 5 per cent.
Developments in Japan indicate an acceleration in wage increases
in manufacturing this year, and we expect wages to increase by between
14 to 15 per cent this year. Consumer prices, following a decline early
in 1967, have been rising ever since and preliminary data for May show
that the index was 7.1 per cent above the level a year earlier. Later
this year, in response to seasonal factors, consumer prices should
weaken. For the year as a whole, consumer prices should not increase
by more than 5 or 6 per cent.
