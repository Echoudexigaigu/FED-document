CURRENT ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL CONDITIONS
By the Staff
Board of Governors
of the Federal Reserve SystemAugust 7, 1968

I -1
SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK
Outlook for economic activity
Economic activity is expected to slow sharply this summer,
as a result of the combined impact of a substantially reduced rate
of inventory accumulation, the 10 per cent tax surcharge, and the
beginning of a slowdown in Federal government expenditures. Real
growth in GNP is projected to come close to a standstill, and the
easing of demands seems likely to be reflected in some reduction of
price pressures.
To date the evidence supporting this outlook is principally
the cutbacks beginning in steel production and ordering. Consumer
spending appears to have been strong in July. But the impact of the
surcharge on consumer incomes has hardly been felt as yet, and in the
fall months, slower employment gains and reduced workweeks should be
additional dampening factors. The precise nature and timing of Federal
expenditure curtailments has not as yet been determined, but a slowing
in the rate of rise in outlays is scheduled now that the Federal pay
raise is behind us. Moreover, private final demand should contribute
relatively little in the way of strength in the second half.
With final sales rising only moderately, the anticipated
sharp curtailment in inventory investment will have an appreciable impact
on over-all economic activity. The rapid liquidation of excess steel
stocks is likely to be the major immediate factor, with the run-off

I -2
continuing past the end of the year despite a sharp cutback in steel
production. Also, reductions of auto stocks are anticipated in the
current quarter, and a reduction of defense-industry stocks should
accompnay the leveling off in defense spending.
Outlook for resource use and prices
With final demands generally not expected to show much
expansion, and substantial steel inventory liquidation starting and
more in prospect, industrial production is likely to edge down during
the second half of this year. With capacity continuing to rise and
output drifting off, a distinct drop appears likely in the utilization
rate. The labor market remained firm in July but, as growth in real
output slows, employment gains are likely to moderate, the average
workweek to shorten, and the unemployment rate to drift up to about
4 per cent or so by year-end.
The steel wage increase, as well as other wage adjustments,
is well above productivity gorwth trends, indicating further pressure
on labor costs and prices this quarter. However, upward pressures on
wages from new collective bargaining agreements should decrease some-
what after the third quarter, as the number of workers affected by
contract expirations drops off sharply.
The rise in consumer prices has continued unabated, but the
exceptionally large rise in June reflected, in part, special influences.
Industrial prices, however, increased very little in July, a continuation
of the pattern prevailing since early spring. A note of uncertainty has

I -3
been injected into industrial price prospects by the flurry of increases
in steel prices following the wage settlement. How large and widespread
the steel advance will be, and how extensively it will pervade the
whole price structure is still in doubt.
Outlook for credit demands
Credit demands are expected to moderate over the balance of
the third quarter and probably into the fourth quarter. The Federal
Government has already obtained, or is in the process of obtaining, a
little more than half of the cash needed in the July-December period.
The remaining need, announced at about $7 billion by the Treasury, is
expected to be raised through tax anticipation bills, and about $1.5
billion, net, of Federal Agency securities. A pre-refunding by the
Treasury of the relatively heavy late 1968 and 1969 maturities of coupon
issues remains a possibility in the months ahead if market conditions
are receptive.
Business demands for credit may be expected to show a marked
slowing. During the past two months, business loan demands at banks
were bolstered by needs to finance accelerated tax payments. Over the
next few months, tax related demands will be less, and in addition the
rate of inventory accumulation is expected to slow down. If expectations
of still lower interest rates continue, net corporate bond issues are
also expected to be at a slower pace in the months ahead. The calendar
in sight for the weeks ahead is relatively moderate, and there are not
many reports of large new issues in the pipeline.

I -4
In cohtrast to the corporate calendar, State and local
government security issues are expected to remain at near their
recent relatively rapid pace. Industrial revenue bonds may continue
to contribute to maintaining the flow of new issues. But in addition,
the return of commercial banks to the market as buyers may encourage
the marketing of securities that were difficult, or too costly, to
place earlier.
The demand outlook suggests that the lower level of bond
yields which has developed in recent weeks, largely on the basis of
expectations, might be maintained. Further declines in bond yields
may develop in the weeks ahead, but the declines may be limited if
there is some snapback in short-term yields. Such a snapback cannot
be ruled out if dealer financing costs remain at relatively high levels.
Outlook for supply of funds
A major factor pushing down longer-term yields has been
the increase of commercial banks investments in intermediate- and
longer-term State and local and U. S. Government securities (including
PC's), largely in the expectation of future declines in interest rates.
These acquisitions were financed for the most part by substantial addi-
tions to outstanding negotiable CD's.
Banks are expected to continue as a source of support to
security markets over the next few months, although the degree of support
may lessen somewhat since banks have been reducing CD offering rates
in recent weeks and, most recently net inflows of'CD funds
have slowed. Moreover, the stimulus to consumer-type

I -5
time and savings deposits provided by lower market interest rates
may well be offset by cutbacks in growth of disposable personal income.
On the other hand, moderation in business loan demand may provide
some additional impetus for banks to invest in securities.
While firm data are not yet available, it appears that
net inflows to mutual savings banks and savings and loan associations
for July were somewhat below the second quarter average. Nevertheless,
net inflows of savings are expected to pick up over the remainder of
the summer, and some expansion in mortgage commitment activity is
indicated. Interest rates on mortgages may also begin to drift down
not only because of the improved prospects for thrift institutions,
but also because the recent marked declines in yields on U. S. Government
and corporate bonds have made mortgages a relatively more attractive
investment to other institutions.
Balance of payments
The over-all balance of payments in June was much better
than had seemed likely, despite an unexpectedly sharp rise in imports
which deepened the trade deficit that had emerged the month before.
Preliminary indications for July confirm the improvement. During the
past three months--May, June, and July--the liquidity deficit before
special transactions seems to have been running well below a $1 billion
annual rate, compared with over $4 billion earlier,
Probably the explanation of this development lies in factors
affecting movements of private capital other than foreign shcrt-term
dollar holdings. While evidence as to the nature of these movements

I-6
is still scanty, it is conceivable that the net flow may remain re-
latively favorable for longer than had previously seemed possible.
If so, the expected recovery in the U.S. trade balance during the rest
of 1968 could be accompanied by maintenance of only a small over-all
deficit on the liquidity basis, or even by further improvement in the
over-all balance. But a marked slowing of the recent large capital
inflows and a renewal of outflows, as projected earlier, is an
alternative development that cannot be ruled out either.
The statistical evidence on recent capital flows relates to
U.S. bank credit repayments received in May and June, which were moderately
large, and to foreign purchases of U.S. corporate stocks in the same
months, which continued very large by accustomed standards. "Errors
and omissions" in the U.S. balance of payments may conceivably have
turned more favorable. There may also have been an unforeseen
diminution of U.S. direct investment outflows, already reduced in the
first quarter of the year. If so, this could have reflected un-
expected success in the raising of local finance by U.S. corporate
affiliates abroad.
Three kinds of forces influencing these movements may be
distinguished. Regulatory requirements strongly affected U.S. bank
lending and corporate direct investment flows during the first half
of 1968, but may lose force as program goals are approached or passed.
Relatively easy monetary policies in continental European countries,
especially Germany, have been another important influence and may con-
tinue so for some months to come. Finally, since May the uncovering to

I-7
general view of political instabilities in France, with their reminder
of latent instabilities in other Common Market countries, has surely
been an important factor. Given these instabilities, and given wide-
spread fears of future inflations, it is possible that the movement of
foreign money into U.S. corporate stocks may continue even if our
stock market turns bearish.
In contrast to these capital flows reducing the deficit on
any basis of calculation, the flow of liquid funds to the United States
through foreign branches of American banks--which affects only the
official settlements balance--was reversed in the last three weeks of
July, after a $3 billion inflow since the first of the year. The
easing of monetary conditions in the United States will probably lead
to further outflows. But resulting difficulties in financing the U.S.
payments balance will be minimized if a flow of foreign private funds
into sterling develops, enabling Britain to pay off official obliga-
tions to us. Such a flow into sterling seems to have begun in July,
when despite a continuing large deficit on current account the
British reserve position improved.

THE ECONOMIC PICTURE IN DETAIL
The Nonfinancial Scene
Gross national product. The economy is expected to be
entering a period of sharply slower growth, as the effect of the surtax
begins to exert its influence, inventory adjustments takes place in
steel and autos, and expansion of government spending is curtailed.
Current dollar GNP is estimated to rise at the rate of $10 billion in
the third quarter and $9 billion in the fourth--about half the quarterly
average increase of the first half of the year. In real terms, growth
would virtually come to a halt in the second half. It is estimated that
GNP adjusted for price change will increase by less than one per cent
per quarter, as compared with an average rise of 5 to 6 per cent in the
first half.
On the favorable side, it appears likely that price pressures
will be dampened by these developments. By the fourth quarter, the
increase in the GNP deflator is expected to have eased to 3.4 per cent,
annual rate, from 4.0 per cent in the second quarter. (The GNP figures
for recent years have been revised by the Department of Commerce. A
summary of these revisions is contained in Appendix B.)
Deceleration of expansion anticipated in the second half
reflects a sharply curtailed rate of inventory accumulation at the same
time that growth of final sales is being held to the relatively slow
second quarter rate. The immediate effect of the surtax is to cut
sharply into the gains in disposable personal income. Personal income

II -2
is expected to rise at a rate of $11 billion in the current quarter--
down sharply from the $16-17 billion average increase in the first two
quarters--and the surtax will absorb over half of this. The anticipated
$4 billion increase in disposable income would be the smallest in over
5 years. But consumers are likely to attempt to maintain their level
of expenditures--as they normally do in the face of a downward shift
in their income--so that the rate of saving is expected to dip, from
7.7 per cent in the second quarter to under 7 per cent in the third.
Consumption expenditures are expected to increase by $8 billion in the
third quarter, about the same dollar gain as in the second quarter.
Spendable income was relatively unaffected by the tax increase
last month, since most paychecks did not have the additional taxes
deducted till after the middle of the month. July sales data do not,
therefore, provide an adequate base for assessing consumer response to
the surcharge. Nevertheless, July weekly retail sales suggest a rise
of more than 2 per cent above the second quarter average with greater
strength than expected in both automobile sales and in other durable
goods purchases. As a result, unit sales of new autos in the current
quarter are now expected to rise slightly from the second quarter
average. Nondurable goods sales, which declined in real terms last
quarter, are also expected to improve moderately in the current period.
But the July pace of gain could be short lived as the full impact of
the surcharge is felt in August and September.
In the fourth quarter, personal income is likely to grow
much more slowly than in the current period, as industrial output is

II -3
cut back further. Reduced gains in nonfarm employment--the quarterly
increase of over 100,000 we have projected is only one-fourth of the
average quarterly increase over the past year--along with shorter work-
week schedules, would sharply curtail gains in wage and salary payments.
This is expected to limit growth in consumption to only $7 billion,
despite a further small decline in the saving rate. Durable goods sales
are expected to decline, partly because sales of autos may be adversely
affected by the accelerated purchase of cars this quarter because of
anticipated higher prices on 1969 models.
Restrictions on Federal government spending also are likely
to be felt increasingly through the remainder of this year. Federal
expenditures had contributed directly $3 billion per quarter to the
increase in GNP in the first half of 1968. Our projections assume that
a significant slowdown in fiscal 1969 expenditures will begin to appear
in the third quarter, reflecting in part spending restraint incorporated
in the recent legislation. Total defense expenditures are expected to
level off in this quarter and to dip slightly in the fourth. As a
result, apart from the recent pay increase, Federal purchases of goods
and services are estimated to rise by only about $500 million in the
third quarter and about level off in the fourth quarter. Growth in
State-local outlays also may slow in view of the tapering-off of grants
to States as part of the move to cut Federal spending.
Business investment in plant and equipment is still projected
to show moderate growth in the second half of this year, in line with
the findings of the recent Commerce-SEC survey. But it should be noted

II -4
that passage of the surtax, and the Budget clamp-down, were not
certainties when the survey was taken in April-May. A more realistic
appraisal by business of the possible impact on profits of the fiscal
package seems to be under way and could be reflected in some downward
revision of investment expenditures for future quarters.
The significantly reduced rate of business investment in
inventories in the second half of the year is likely to be a major
factor retarding economic growth. Total nonfarm inventory accumulation
of $5 billion is anticipated in the third quarter and only $3 billion
in the fourth--down significantly from the net accumulation of over $8
billion in the past quarter. With the settlement of the steel wage
negotiations, steel producers and users have in August begun to run
down their heavy stocks. We are estimating that decumulation will con-
tinue beyond the end of this year, even with a possible reduction of
steel output by as much as one-third from recent advanced levels. In
addition, some decumulation of defense stocks is anticipated to accom-
pany the leveling off in defense spending in the second half of the
year. On the other hand, there may be some unintended accumulation of
consumer goods in the fourth quarter, if consumer spending for goods
shows little strength.
Residential construction outlays should decline in the third
quarter for the first time since early 1967 and to continue at these
lower levels in the fourth quarter. The rate of housing starts con-
sistent with this expenditure projection calls for a further drop in
the third quarter to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.32 million

II -5
units--about the same rate as in June. If there is a continuation of
the recent improvement in availability of mortgage funds, glimmerings
of which seemed to appear in July, a revival in housing starts would
be possible later this year, but too late to have much impact on resi-
dential construction outlays in the fourth quarter.
The Federal deficit should decline significantly in the
second half, mainly reflecting additional tax revenues but also the
moderation of growth in government expenditures. Higher withholdings
from personal taxes alone will boost Federal revenues by over $6 billion,
at an annual rate. (The increase in corporate taxes, which are treated
on an accrual basis, was included retroactively in first and second
quarter receipts.) The deficit, NIA basis, should dip to $7 billion in
the fourth quarter, from a level of over $10 billion in the second; in
late 1967, the deficit was over $12 billion.

Industrial production. Present indications are that
industrial production in July rose one-half index point or more from
the preliminary June level of 164.4 per cent. At about 165, the total
index would be 5 per cent above a year earlier and 6 per cent above the
1967 low.
The July gain in industrial production stems in part from a
much smaller than usual decline in steel output. With settlement of
the labor contract, steel production will be reduced sharply in August
and September, months in which output normally rises, and this is likely
to depress the total index. In 1962, 1963, and 1965, under somewhat
similar circumstances, steel production declined 30 per cent in 4 months
or the equivalent of 2.5 points in the total index. In 1963 and 1965,
however, the economy was expanding rapidly and the cutbacks in steel
had only a marginal influence on the continued rise in industrial pro-
duction.
In July auto and truck assemblies, after allowances for the
model changeover period, continued at the high June level. Output of
television sets, especially monochrome, declined in July. Other avail-
able data, including manhours, indicate further increases in production
of industrial materials, especially paper, chemicals and rubber products;
a renewed upswing in output of defense equipment; and, at the least, no
decline in production of business equipment.
Capacity utilization. The June rate of manufacturing
capacity utilization is estimated at 84.6 per cent, down slightly from

II -9
May. If manufacturing output increased slightly in July, as now indi-
cated, the operating rate will show little change.
The capacity and utilization series have recently been
revised. The main effect of these revisions has been to raise the
level of operating rates for recent quarters by about 0.4 points.
Manufacturing investment in fixed capital remains high and estimated
capacity continues to increase rapidly. The utilization rate has
remained within a very narrow range in the past 12 months.

Unit auto sales and stocks. Dealer deliveries of new
domestic autos increased sharply in the final 10 days of July and were
almost one-fourth above a year earlier. For the month, deliveries
were up 13 per cent from last year and were at an annual rate of 9.1
million units, compared to 8.8 million in June. July sales were the
highest since March 1966. Sales contests and the anticipation of higher
prices on the 1969 models are reported to have contributed to the surge
in sales.

II -10
The stock of new cars decreased only slightly during the
middle period of July and on July 20 totaled a record 1.71 million
units (unadjusted). It is estimated that the supply of new cars dropped
seasonally to about 1.6 million units in the final period of July, up
one-third from a year earlier and equal to the record 1966 level.
Sales of new imported cars in July continued strong and were
over one-fourth above a year earlier. Despite the surge in domestic
new car sales, imports still captured 9.5 per cent of the total new car
market. For the first 7 months of this year, import sales were one-
third above a year ago.
Consumer credit. Consumer installment credit again increased
at a rapid pace in June. The seasonally adjusted annual rate of expan-
sion in credit outstanding amounted to $7.6 billion, compared with $7.3
billion in May and $7.1 billion for the second quarter as a whole. As
may be seen in the table, the second quarter rise is the largest since
early 1966.
Demand for auto credit and personal loans continued high in
June, while extensions of nonautomotive consumer goods credit, which
had slackened in May, exceeded the previous high reached in April. The
strength of new auto sales in July suggests a continued large rise in
auto credit.

As reported in our new monthly series, indebtedness on bank
credit card and check-credit plans increased approximately $170 million
between the end of January and June 1968, of which $100 million was in
credit card accounts. At midyear, consumers owed commercial banks a
total of $914 million on credit card plans and $600 million on check-
credit and other revolving credit plans. Thus, the rate of increase
so far this year has been at a annual rate of around 30 per cent.
Manufacturers' inventories. The book value of inventories
held by manufacturers was little changed in June, following a rise of
almost $1.3 billion in April and May combined. Revised figures for May
show a rise of $550 million--nearly twice as much as shown a month ago
by the preliminary figures. For the April-May-June period book value
of manufacturers' stocks rose at an annual rate of $5.2 billion.

II -12
Durable goods producers continued to build up inventories in
June, while nondurable goods manufacturers reduced stocks somewhat as
shipments surged relative to production. The rise at durable goods
industries was largely concentrated at producers of defense products
(aircraft) and machinery and equipment. At nondurable goods industries
stocks held by producers of foods and chemicals were reduced.
The June rise in stocks held by durable goods producers
resulted in an edging up of their inventories-shipments ratio following
a substantial decline in May, but the ratio continued at a level below
most of last year. The stocks-sales ratio of nondurable goods producers
declined further in June and was lower than any time since the present
series began in 1948.
The bulk of the accumulation in the second quarter as a whole
was by producers of defense products, machinery and equipment, and con-
struction materials and supplies. Quarterly changes in inventories of
selected groupings of manufacturing industries are shown in the follow-
ing table.

Durable goods orders and shipments. New orders received by
manufacturers of durable goods declined 3 per cent in June and were
6.5 per cent below their peak at the end of last year. Unfilled orders
of durable goods manufacturers declined a bit in June from their record
high in May. The June decline in new orders veils several significant,
but diverse, developments. There were sharp cutbacks in orders for
iron and steel and aircraft and parts and a moderate reduction in orders
for fabricated metal products. On the other hand, orders for nonferrous
metals and machinery and equipment, particularly electrical machinery,
rose substantially.
The June rise in new orders for machinery and equipment--6.7
per cent--continued the pattern of monthly increases which began in
March and lifted the total to a level 15 per cent above the February
low. The decline in orders for aircraft resulted in a reduction in the
defense products grouping to the lowest level in more than six months.
Orders for commercial aircraft, which are included with military air-
craft in the defense products market category, had been exceptionally
high in April and moderately high in May.
Shipments of durable goods producers were off in June, but
only slightly from the record high in May as all industry groupings
except transportation equipment registered advances. Shipments of non-
durable goods rose in June to a record high more than 8 per cent above
the level six months earlier.

II -14
Construction and real estate. New construction put in place
apparently changed little in July--based on revised series which now
incorporate new basic data for some series and results of Census review
of seasonal adjustment factors for all series back to 1965. However,
the July development followed a 3 per cent downward revision in the
rate originally reported for June, owing mainly to a 5 per cent correc-
tion in outlays for private residential construction. Such outlays in
July were well below their April peak, but they were still considerably
above the rising rate a year earlier, unlike private nonresidential
construction expenditures. Public construction activity, which was
also revised downward for June, edged to a new high in July.

Private housing starts, which on the basis of revised data
had already dropped 15 per cent in May from the advanced April rate,
edged off moderately further in June. Unlike May, the June decline was

II -15
concentrated entirely in single family starts. Multifamily starts
reversed direction again to leave the second quarter average for this
extremely volatile group 8 per cent above the first quarter average and
the highest since the first quarter of 1964. With single family starts
down 13 per cent on a quarter-to-quarter basis, the annual rate of
total starts in the second quarter as a whole averaged 1.42 million,
6 per cent below the first quarter rate and about the same as in the
third quarter of 1967 when starts were rising.
Permits in permit-issuing areas dipped further in June. With
single family units in decline for the third consecutive month, multi-
family permits accounted for virtually half of total permits in June,
an unusually high share. Regionally, only the North Central states
showed a decline in total permits rates from May to June.

The prospective slowing in general economic growth and the
possibility of monetary easing in the period ahead as a result of
passage of the fiscal restraint package in late June has already begun
to raise industry hopes that a sustained recovery in housing starts
will commence even before the yearend. Currently, housing activity is
in a transitional situation, marked by the lagged effects of earlier
tightening in mortgage and related markets and bullish expectations
for 1969. For the current quarter, the less than expected drop in net
inflows to major lending institutions over the first half of the year
and the pressures of demands pent up by more than two years of under-
building are likely to operate against further declines this summer.
If so, starts in July and August may run at least somewhat above the
June average, and even with September temporarily lower--for technical
reasons--the third quarter average may stay above June's 1.31 million
seasonally adjusted annual rate and within 7 per cent of the still
relatively advanced rate in the second quarter.
Unlike 1966, the momentum of builders has remained largely
unbroken, even though mortgage commitments, building permits and housing
starts were in decline through most or all of the second quarter. Thus,
going farther into the future, the possibility that fourth quarter
starts may rise above the third quarter rate now seems tenable. This
will depend, however, on the extent to which builders have not already
moved ahead of schedule in their drive to maintain the advanced pace
which developed earlier this year. It will also depend on actual as
well as expected funds flows and interest rate developments as the

II -17
second half progresses. (The speed with which various elements of the
exceptionally broad housing legislation signed by the President on
August 1 can be implemented may also be a factor, though a minor one,
as described in Appendix A.) In any event, because of the inevitable
lag from inflows through commitments to starts, any improvement in funds
flows will now most likely have its major impact on construction and
real estate activity in 1969 rather than this year. On this score, a
summary of the FRB-FHLBB survey of mortgage lenders' evaluations of
current and prospective inflow and commitment activity in the present
quarter may be found on page III -8 of this Greenbook; the detailed
results are scheduled for release in the Greenbook Supplement this
Friday.
Labor market. Although the labor market continues firm and
the workweek relatively long, employment gains have been comparatively
modest in recent months. Growth in the civilian labor force also has
moderated, tending to limit increases in unemployment. Nevertheless,
at 3.7 per cent in July, the unemployment rate was up slightly from its
April-May low of 3.5 per cent.
Thus far, the easing in demand for labor has been reflected
in a rise in teenage unemployment. Their unemployment rate, at 13.6
per cent in both June and July, was well above rates earlier this year,
suggesting that youngsters are not doing as well in the job market as
they did during the school year or last summer. Moreover, the teenage
labor force showed a net reduction in July--to its lowest level since

II -18
last January--suggesting that some youngsters may have become discour-
aged with the lack of employment opportunities and given up the job
search.

The recent slowdown in employment growth has been relatively
widespread, with the most noticeable weakness in construction, where
July employment was off by 207,000 from its February peak. Total non-
farm payroll employment rose 159,000 in July, but this partly reflected
a late model changeover in the auto industry--inflating the manufacturing
figure by about 50,000--which will have a reverse effect in August.
Exclusive of the transportation equipment industry, manufacturing
employment rose by only 15,000 in July. Half of that rise occurred in
the volatile primary metals group where, following the steel-labor agree-
ment, output is being curtailed and substantial layoffs are expected.
Much of the job gain in July was concentrated in government, trade, and
services.

With real growth expected to drop to low levels in the third
and fourth quarters, employment growth is likely to ease further. The
bulk of the adjustment is anticipated in the industrial sector where
actual employment declines are expected. Though some of the necessary
adjustment probably will come through reduction of the workweek, large
employment cuts are expected in steel and, to a lesser extent, in other
metal-using industries. With employment growing more slowly, unemploy-
ment will likely rise through the fall with the rate reaching 4 per cent
in the fourth quarter.
The steel contract. Based on the data now available to the
staff, the steel settlement calls for an increase of about 5-1/2 to 6
per cent annually in hourly compensation (which includes both wages and
fringes). This seems a somewhat more moderate increase than those won
in recent agreements in the auto, aluminum, and can industries, which
average over 6 per cent.

3/ Extent of the increase in wages depends upon rise in consumer

In line with the recent pattern of large first-year wage
increases in new contracts, basic wage rates in steel will rise by an
average of 25 cents (almost 7 per cent) immediately. In 1969 and 1970
wage gains should drop sharply to about 14 cents (about 3.5 per cent)
a year. Fringe benefits in the new contract provide for increased
pensions and supplemental unemployment payments, and an improved vaca-
tion and holiday plan. The increases in fringe benefits are estimated
to be somewhat less than those obtained in other comparable industries.
When fringes are included, the annual increases in compensation are more
uniform, but still show a pronounced decline over the life of the contract.
The steel settlement about completes a round of important
collective bargaining settlements which have been dominated by large
first-year wage increases designed to catch-up with the consumer price

II -21
increases of recent years. These same contracts typically include much
smaller wage boosts in subsequent years, which should allow easing in
labor cost pressure in later years of the contract. In addition, recent
settlements generally have not included new cost-of-living escalator
clauses, and those in existence were frequently curtailed. By accepting
smaller wage increases in subsequent years of long-term contracts, unions
seem to assume that price rises may ease over the next several years.
Thus, recent agreements are in marked contrast to those negotiated in
earlier inflationary periods when increases in the number of contracts
with escalator clauses and high annual wage increases over the life of
contracts were characteristically associated with expectations of a con-
tinuing price spiral.
For the remainder of this year the only important bargaining
in durable goods industry takes place in the aerospace industry. In
1969, the number of durable goods workers affected by new contract nego-
tiations drops by more than half from the 1968 average. The number of
workers affected by contract negotiations outside durable-goods manufac-
turing rises somewhat in 1969, with especially large increases in
communications and apparel. Since wage settlements in these industries
are generally not pace setters, and some slack in the economy is expected
to limit wage advances, pressures for large negotiated settlements in
1969 should be less than in 1967 and 1968.
With key settlements largely over for several years, future wage
increases scheduled to be more in line with expected productivity gains,
and escalator clauses nonexistent or weakened, the outlook is for some
slowing down in the rate of increase in hourly compensation in manufac-
turing.

II -22
Wholesale prices. Average prices of industrial commodities
increased only 0.1 per cent in July according to the BLS preliminary
estimate. The over-all wholesale price index, however, rose 0.4 per
cent as farm products and processed foods and also feeds advanced
substantially, in large part seasonally.
An increase of 0.2 per cent in industrial commodity prices
in June had returned the industrial index to the April level of 108.8
per cent of the 1957-59 average, increases in prices of gasoline and
apparel were major elements in the rise. The termination of dealer
incentive programs sent prices of new cars up 0.5 per cent. There
were few other important changes in June, and it is expected that more
complete July data will show few significant developments for industrial
commodities. The easing in the upward pressure on industrial commodity
prices in recent months is apparent from an examination of price changes
for 225 industrial product classes included in the index.

The importance of special factors--the copper strike and the
lumber situation, for example--that acted as major propellants to the
rise in industrial prices last fall and winter have diminished in
importance. Copper prices have declined sharply in recent months fol-
lowing the strike settlement--although they are still about 10 per cent
above the pre-strike level. The circumstances affecting the lumber
industry earlier--including increased housing starts, drought, exports
to Japan, and labor problems in the Canadian lumber industry--have also
changed as housing starts have declined and materials supplies have
increased. The outlook for prices of both copper and lumber, therefore,
is for more stability. The importance of this is underlined by the
fact that nonferrous metals and lumber and wood products alone accounted
for nearly one-quarter of the total rise in industrial commodities over
the past year.
Prices of finished steel were relatively stable earlier this
year, helping to limit the rise in average industrial prices. But
recent announcements of price increases following the steel wage

II -24
settlement will boost the wholesale price index for August. The weight
of about 3-1/4 per cent for steel mill products in the wholesale price
index understates steel's importance as increases in steel prices have
secondary effects which far exceed its direct weight in the index.
No across-the-board increases had occurred for 10 years in
the steel industry, but there have been numerous selective increases;
for example, prices were increased in 1967 for about 70 per cent of
steel items produced. Steel mill prices in June were about 2-1/2 per
cent above June 1967. Bethlehem and several other producers have posted
an across-the-board increase of close to 5 per cent; but even if this
does not hold, a sizable average increase gained through selective
boosts seems likely.
Consumer prices. The consumer price index rose 0.5 per cent
in June, the largest increase since February 1966. About one-half of
this increase was attributable to the broad advance of consumer services
which spurted by 0.7 per cent. Increased homeownership costs led the
advance in service charges, with home mortgage interest charges up
nearly 4 per cent (and accounting for as much as one-fourth of the total
rise in the CPI) as a result of increases in rates on conventional mort-
gages and in the maximum interest rate allowed on Federally-underwritten
home loans. As usual, prices of other services and rents also advanced.
Medical care services, however, which had shown extraordinarily large
advances for some time, tapered off to a 0.3 per cent increase in June.

II -25
Prices of food at home rose 0.2 per cent--less than season-
ally. Restaurant meals, which contain a large element of service costs,
increased 0.5 per cent in June. Prices of food can be expected to
increase seasonally during the summer as meats show an upward trend at
retail, but fruits and vegetables should decline further. Prices of
commodities other than foods on average advanced considerably in June.

II -26
Farm production prospects in 1968. Last year's record crop
and livestock production, 18 per cent above the 1957-59 average, is
likely to be at least equaled in 1968 according to July surveys of
production prospects. Crop progress reported on July 1 indicates that
higher yields will offset 2 per cent smaller plantings. Wheat, rice and
soybean crops are expected to be larger than in 1967 and feed grains and
tobacco smaller. Corn output, with acreage reduced 7.5 per cent through
diversion, is estimated at 4.5 billion bushels, 6 per cent below last
year's record. The estimate, based on average yields, may be understated.
A second year of moderate net additions to carryover stocks of soybeans,
wheat, and corn seems likely. The prospective 11.0 to 11.5 million bale
cotton crop is less than utilization, but carryover stocks of 6.75 million
bales this August assure adequate supplies. Prospects for fruits and
vegetables in the second half of the year are excellent.
For livestock food products, the major question in 1968 is the
level of beef and pork slaughter in the fourth quarter. Earlier projections
had indicated fairly significant declines. From the number and weight
distribution of cattle on feed in July, however, it appears that beef
production in the fourth quarter will exceed a year earlier. If the
estimated 3 per cent fewer pigs reported on farms on June 1 for fall
slaughter is reasonably accurate, the fourth quarter seasonal rise in
pork production will fall short of a year earlier. However, many analysts
doubt that fall slaughter will vary much from a year earlier. One reason
cited is that the cut-back in March-May farrowings interrupted an uptrend
in production in response to favorable returns that began last fall and
is continuing in June-November 1968, according to producer intentions.

II -27
Another reason is the fact that the entire decline in March-May
farrowings in the Western Corn Belt was in Iowa, the leading producing
state, while neighboring states' production was little changed. One
Iowa analyst believes that this sharply different pattern in Iowa is
unlikely.
Through the first half of 1968, livestock food production
was about the same as last year but the mix differed a little, as
moderately reduced output of dairy and poultry products was just about
offset by increased output of red meats, principally pork. Civilian per
capita consumption of red meats, amounting to 44.5 pounds in the first
quarter and 43.9 in the second, was 2 per cent above a year earlier in
both quarters. Third quarter livestock food production appears to be
following trends set in the first half, with pork and beef production
continuing above year earlier levels.
By the fourth quarter there are indications that the downtrend
in milk will have leveled out and broiler production risen above 1967.
Egg and turkey output will be sharply below a year earlier. As is often
the case, the principal unknown in the fourth quarter outlook for live-
stock production and prices is hog production.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL SITUATION
Bank credit. Following relatively little expansion in
June--when bank liquidation of security holdings nearly offset the
large rise in business loans--total loans and investments at all
commercial banks are estimated to have increased $8.5 billion in
July, or at about a 28.5 per cent annual rate. The July surge reflects
primarily heavy bank participation in the Treasury bill financing, and
broker-dealer borrowing to finance increased inventories of securities.
(The large July increase--for the second consecutive year--reflects
in part the difficulty of developing seasonal adjustment factors to
take account of the shifting pattern of Treasury financings,) Business
loan growth in July, although substantial, was somewhat less than
expected in view of the recent increase in corporate tax liabilities.

Following little net change in the second quarter, bank
holdings of U.S. Government securities rose sharply in July, account-
ing for almost one-half of the total expansion in bank credit. Banks
were allotted virtually all of the $4 billion in tax anticipation
bills offered by the Treasury in the early-month financing--payable
with full tax and loan credit--and liquidation of these and other
Treasury issues immediately subsequent to the financing was relatively
light. In the last reporting week of July, large banks in New York
and Chicago again added to their holdings of Governments, mainly
Treasury bills. The increase in bank holdings of Government securi-
ties combined with the increase in loans to brokers and dealers for
purchasing or carrying Government securities accounted for roughly
two-thirds of the July expansion in total bank credit.
With deposit inflows much improved and with prospects for
a slowing of loan demand, banks also have begun to add to their hold-
ings of other securities. These holdings increased $400 million
in July--mostly in relatively high yielding longer-term municipals--
after having declined slightly in the second quarter.
Although total bank loans expanded rapidly, business loan
growth slowed somewhat from the pace of the second quarter in spite
of the $1.1 million increase in July corporate tax payments result-
ing from the recent tax legislation. Business borrowing over the
tax date was moderate, apparently as corporate liquidity positions

III -3
were sufficient to allow corporations to meet their increased tax
liabilities without heavy reliance upon bank credit. A contra-
seasonal increase in loans to finance companies during the tax
period suggests that corporations may have liquidated holdings of
finance company paper to meet some of their tax payments.
The industrial breakdown of business loans shows more than
normal use of bank credit by retail trade, textiles, and petroleum
refining, while public utilities, chemicals, mining, and construction
borrowed somewhat less at banks than is usual during July. Growth
in term loans, as in recent months, remained relatively substantial,
reflecting for the most part continued borrowing by both metal-producing
and metal-using industries.
Security loans rose approximately $2.7 billion in July
with much of this increase reflecting bank financing of increased
dealer positions of Government securities. Broker-dealer loans for
purchasing or carrying other securities also rose sharply, parti-
cularly in the first half of the month, and may reflect the specu-
lative inventory build-up of CD's and other money market instruments
in anticipation of future interest rate declines. Consumer loans
continued to expand at the increased pace, and real estate loans
at the reduced pace, of recent months.
Bank deposits. Time and savings deposits at all commercial
banks in July are estimated to have increased by $2.4 billion,

III -4
on a daily average basis, or at about a 15.5 per cent annual rate.
Most of the acceleration can be attributed to heavy CD sales by
banks, since inflows of consumer-type time and savings deposits re-
mained close to the moderate pace of recent months.

With most short-term market rates of interest still declining,
all but the shortest-maturity CD's have become competitive with money
market instruments and banks have taken the opportunity to recoup CD's
lost in recent months. During the first four weeks in July, large
banks added more than $2.0 billion to their outstandings, bringing this
total to a new high of $21.3 billion. Moreover, in view of the ready
availability of these funds, large money market banks have reduced their
offering rates from 25 to 50 basis points below Regulation Q ceilings
on 3-month maturities and over.

III -5
During the first four weeks of July, consumer-type time
and savings deposits at large banks expanded at about the pace of
recent months in spite of a decline in regular savings deposits
following mid-year interest crediting. The reduction in savings
deposits was moderate, given interest rate relationships, as com-
pared to the declines in April of this year and in July 1966. Growth
in time certificates and open accounts more than offset the reduction
of savings deposits, probably reflecting some movement of funds within
individual banks. At country banks, too, savings deposits declined
following the interest-crediting period, but less than at large
banks, where depositors are more interest-sensitive. This decline
also was much more than offset by increases in time deposits.
With deposit inflows much improved, banks did not resort
to the Euro-dollar market for increased funds in July as they had
in recent months. Over the four weeks ending July 31, the level of
bank liabilities to foreign branches declined about $600 million on
balance, in sharp contrast to the $2 billion increase in these
liabilities during the previous two months,
The money stock, on a daily average basis, is estimated
to have expanded at about a 13.5 per cent annual rate in July, al-
most twice the rate of growth in June. This rapid increase reflects
in part the $1.1 billion decline in U.S. Government deposits, although
the large expansion of bank credit in July probably also
contributed to a temporary build-up of demand deposits and the
money stock.

III -6
Nonbank depositary institutions. Complete data for
intermediary savings flow during July are not yet available, However,
preliminary information from the FHLBB sample survey suggests that
inflows to the savings and loan associations continued to deteriorate during
the latter half of July, in contrast to typical patterns. Most of
the deterioration occurred in the San Francisco District. On a
seasonally-adjusted basis, July inflows to all S&L's are now
estimated to have grown at slightly less than a 5 per cent annual rate.
The volume of inflows--approximately $6 billion at an annual rate--is
about 15 per cent less than in the first half of 1968.

In addition to the liberalization of Federal savings and loan
operations stemming from the 1968 Housing Bill as discussed in
Appendix A, two other developments affecting savings and loan
associations have materialized. Effective August 1, the FHLBB has
reduced member savings and loan reserve requirements by one-half of
1/one per cent- in an attempt to stimulate mortgage lending, at least
in the short run. Although the aggregate amount potentially freed
has been estimated at $600 million, there is no assurance that this
liberalization will be fully utilized--and in fact there will probably
not be any reliable way to measure its impact,
The FHLBB also has permitted Federal associations to offer a
"90-day notice" / account as of the end of July, at ceiling rates of
4.75 per cent for most associations, but at 5 per cent for those
associations in direct competition with mutual savings banks. While
these ceilings are no higher than those on regular accounts, this new
account broadens the options available to associations in the competiton
for savings--and will possibly enable associations to offer below-ceiling
rates on regular accounts to thereby reduce total dividend costs.
The New York State legislation, effective July 1, enabling
thrift institutions to offer both day-of-deposit to day-of-withdrawal
3/savings accounts and time deposits,- was implemented by most of the
1/ Effective August 1, reserves in the form of holdings of cash and
U.S. Governments are required to equal at least 6.5 per cent of
total share capital.
2/ This new account requires 90-days' written notice of withdrawal
except for withdrawals at the end of a dividend-crediting period
if the funds had been in the account for at least 90 days, and
in the case of emergencies. Prior to this action, Federal S&L's
could issue special accounts for no less than 6 months.
3/ Prior to this legislation, New York State thrift institutions
were unable to contract in advance an interest rate to be paid
on their deposits.

III -8
savings banks in the New York City area as well as by a few banks located
elsewhere in the State. The prevalent rate on the day-of-deposit
plans was 4.75 per cent; that on time deposits was 5 per cent, with a
minimum initial deposit of $1,000 also generally required. Most of
the savings banks in the State continued to offer 5 per cent--the
current ceiling -on regular deposits.
Mortgages market developments. Results of the July FRB-FHLBB
mortgage market surveys, to be detailed in the Greenbook Supplement,
suggest that the residential mortgage market was turning toward ease
at the time the surveys were taken after the end of the reinvestment
period. In this transitional phase, the mortgage market was still
characterized by some uncertainty about future inflows of funds and
interest rate developments, compounded by some continuing structural
problems posed by below-market usury ceilings, policy loan demands,
and discounts on Government-underwritten mortgages. Nevertheless, new
mortgage commitments being made in July by the lenders interviewed
were generally running only slightly below advanced year-earlier levels,
with considerable variation by type of respondent and area in the face
of relatively strong credit demands. Over the August-October period,
the same lenders anticipated that their inflows of funds would be some-
what below the exceptionally strong volume for the same period a year
earlier, with savings and loan associations looking for much less
favorable savings inflows than their bank competitors. In view of
these and other factors, respondents on balance anticipated that their
new mortgage commitments to be approved during the next 3 months would
fall somewhat short of matching the large year-earlier rate.

III -9
The surveys took place at a time when other signs were
appearing that both the primary and secondary mortgage market had begun
to ease, following an extended period of gradual tightening which had
persisted for more than a year. Although official FHA series for July
are not yet available, confidential FNMA field reports inicate that
yields on FHA and VA mortgages traded in the private secondary market
:urned down last month, undoubtedly in response to passage of the fiscal
package as well as the less unfavorable than expected savings experience
of thrift institutions during the June-July reinvestment period. The
FNMA field reports also emphasize that availability of residential
mortgage funds generally improved in July, although non-rate terms
remained relatively strict. In line with quickened investor interest
in mortgages, there was talk among some mortgage bankers about a
possible shortage of loans available for immediate delivery, with a
number of mortgage companies reportedly delaying delivery in anti-
cipation of more favorable mortgage prices ahead.
Supporting these signs of a recent turnaround in the mortgage
market, implicit yields in the FNMA weekly forward commitment auction
on PHA and VA home loans available for future delivery to FNMA dropped
sharply through mid-July from their mid-June peak, and then changed
little further at a still-advanced level, as the table shows. Since
mid-June, there has been a noticeable downtrend in the share of
total auction bids accounted for by one-year purchase commitments on
mortgages to be secured by new homes not yet started. The decline has
apparently resulted from a lessening of builder needs for this type
of backstop protection in anticipation of easier mortgage market
conditions some time later--a viewpoint confirmed by trade reports.

With average home mortgage yields remaining above 7.0 per
cent through July, below-market usury ceilings have continued to
limit mortgage investment. Currently 11 states, which accounted for
about a fifth of the total unit volume of residential building
permits issued last year, still have rate limits of 7 per cent or less.
In addition, many lenders have apparently sharply curtailed lending
in Maryland (which accounted for 3 per cent of total permits last
year), because of difficulties in interpreting the new 8 per cent
usury statute which became effective July 1.Auction

On July 22, the President authorized additional Government
funds for housing construction by releasing $350 million for certain
FNMA special assistance purchase commitments. These commitments,
to be issued against below-market rate residential mortgages during
the current fiscal year, could underwrite the start of about 27.00
dwellings within the next 6 months or so. On August 1, the President
signed the new omnibus housing act, summarized in Appendix A, which
authorizes programs of public and private assistance that could
bolster total housing starts during the fiscal year 1969 by up to
50,000 net additional units.
Over the month of June as a whole, mortgage rates on new
homes averaged around 7-1/4 per cent in the primary market for
conventional loans and 7-1/2 per cent in the more volatile private
secondary market for Government-underwritten loans, according
to the FHAseries shown in the table. Increases in rates on
conventional first mortgages continued in all geographic regions,
and tended to be particularly sharp in areas where increases in usury
rate ceilings had recently been put into effect. Meanwhile, discounts
on FHA mortgages remained large enough to inhibit some transactions
involving this type of financing. However, yield spreads favoring
home mortgages relative to new issues of high grade corporate bonds
improved somewhat further in June.

Total outstanding residential mortgage commitments available
for future takedown on new and existing properties from reporting
lenders edged lower in June for the second consecutive month, although
they continued sharply above year-earlier levels. The commitment
backlog remained slightly above the advanced rate attained at the
end of 1965, as the table shows. But with construction costs and
housing prices climbing further since 1965, the dollar volume of
commitments outstanding this June probably underwrote somewhat fewer
future mortgage transactions than the same volume in 1965, because
more credit is now.required per commitment. Also, takedowns of old
commitments have apparently slowed as expiration dates have been
stretched out, so that somewhat less of the total current backlog
remained available for near-term takedown than was the case several
years ago. Offsetting, at least in part, these limiting factors
or near-term construction is the current tendency for more real
estate transactions to be consummated without reliance on new
extensions of mortgage funds, by making use of assumed mortgages,
instalment land contracts, and similar arrangements.

A general shift in the sentiments of market participants
appears to account in large measure for the yield declines, as recent
events have strengthened the view that bond yields had reached an upper
turning point. In this atmosphere, dealers priced bonds aggressively
as well as sought additional inventory, and investors responded with
enthusiasm to the now lower-yielding new issues. Consequently, the
volume of unsold bonds in syndicate and available on original offering
terms is relatively light.

III -16
Flotations of new corporate public bonds in July is estimated
to have aggregated about $1.3 billion, slightly below earlier estimates
due to the rescheduling to August of some issues orignallly expected
in July. Nonetheless, the volume of issues exceeded the average
monthly volume during the first half by a sizable margin. Corporate
security offerings in July, including private placements and stock
offerings, are estimated to have totaled $2.3 billion--somewhat below
June as well as below the outsized volume recorded during the summer
months of 1967.

Scheduled offerings of corporate public bonds in August
now approximate $500 million, with the ultimate volume estimated at
a relatively light $825 million. This places expected August offerings
about one-third less than July, a more than seasonal decline, and
nearly $1 billion less than the outsized volune a year earlier. Absent
from the August calendar so far are any sizable straight debt offerings
of prime industrial corporations--the type of issues which led to a
bulge in the past two months as well as during the summer and fall of
1967. And underwriters report that such offerings are not presently
in the pipeline for near-term issuance. Several factors appear to
contribute to the slowing of corporate long-term credit demands,
including the prospective restraint in growth of the economy, a good
availability of bank credit, a relatively strong corporate liquidity
position, and increased profits (likely through the second quarter
even after allowing for the surcharge). Most important, however,
may be the expectations of corporate treasurers that yields will be
lower some months hence. When taking account of private placements
and stock offerings, the volume of total corporate security issues
will likely aggregate less than $1.7 billion in August, well below
recent months,
In contrast to the corporate market, the volume of State
and local government bond offerings shows no signs of abating. The
volume of new issues in July amounted to an estimated $1.4 billion, the

III -18
largest month in a year. Successful distribution of these issues at
declining yields was reportedly accomplished in large part by the
increased participation of commercial banks.
The usual seasonal drop-off of new offerings in August
is not expected this year, and estimated volume for the month is
$1.3 billion. It should be noted, however, that the calendar contains
several large negotiated revenue bond issues that might be pushed
into September and, therefore, lead to a reduced August volume.

Stock market. Having reached new all-time highs in mid -July,
common stock prices subsequently turned down relatively sharply. By
early August New York Stock Exchange issues on average were approximately
6 per cent below their mid-summer peaks. Trading volume during the

III -19
decline grew steadily lighter, with block transactions--an indicator
of institutional activity--especially reduced. Continuation of
back-office difficulties, however, has resulted in the extension of
the 4-day trading week through the end of August.
The latest market retreat has apparently been associated
with institutional apathy produced by the expected relatively greater
capital gains opportunities in the bond market; belated pessimism on
the part of some investors regarding the economic impacts of the tax
increase probably also contributed to the market decline. Dis-
enchantment with less seasoned issues has been evident, as indicated
by the American Exchange Index which has dropped somewhat more sharply
in the last few weeks.

The earlier indications that the growth in stock market credit
was sharply curtailed in June--probably owing in part to the increase
in margin requirements--are confirmed by the preliminary figures for
customers' margin debt at brokers. Such debt rose only $10 million
(preliminary) during that month. Bank purpose loans to non-brokers rose
$50 million, the largest increase since October 1967. The increase,
however, could reflect a rise in borrowing against bonds (other than
U. S. Governments) as traders moved to take advantage of the rising
bond prices expected to follow the tax increase.

rate dropping from 5.42 per cent on July 15 to 4.89 per cent on

The moderate decline in interest rates which had been
underway since late June seemed in danger of stalling just prior to
the last Committee meeting. Several developments in succeeding weeks,
however, sparked renewed market optimism and moved rates significantly
lower. The lowering of the System's repurchase agreement rate on the

II -22
day after the Committee meeting from 5-5/8 to 5-1/2 per cent was the
first of these influences, since it was widely construed as an indica-
tion of Committee intentions. The logic of this interpretation was
at the same time encouraged by economic reports showing a slower
growth in final demands druing the second quarter and pointing to
substantial further slackening of business activity later in the
year. In consequence, demand for Government issues increased markedly,
with dealers reporting substantial sales to a wide range of investors
and at the same time moving to build up their own positions.
Expectations of lower rates created particularly strong
demands for issues of longer maturity as investors sought to
acquire positions while rates were still historically attractive. In
this atmosphere, the Treasury's offering of $800 million of FNMA
participation certificates received a very enthusiastic response.
Banks are reported to have acquired the bulk of the $30C million, 10-year
PC's, offered to yield 6-1/8 per cent, while a wide variety of investors
showed interest in the $500 million, 20-year maturity, sold to yield
6.20 per cent. Both issues soon traded up in price to yield around
6,00 per cent and yields on longer-term Government securities responded
accordingly to this impressive demonstration of the underlying
strength of investor demands.
Expectations of sizable new money borrowing on the Treasury's
August refinancing,along with the possibility of some pre-refunding
of near-dated maturities other than August "rights" stimulated dealers
to adjust their positions in anticipation of these possibilities and

III -23
temporarily slowed the decline in yields in the longer area of the
Government list. When the refinancing was announced as a straight
cash operation without a pre-refunding and new money borrowing was
limited to $1.5 billion, yield declines were renewed.
The yield response was particularly pronounced in the Treasury
bill market. With no new short-term coupon issue being offered in the
financing, holders of the $3.7 billion of publicly-held August
maturities not wanting the 6-year note began to seek alternative
investments in other short-term securities. In the week following
the Treasury's announcement, when the market supply of immediately
available bills had already been substantially depleted, downward
pressures on bill rates became intense. At one point the yield in
the key 3-month bill dropped to a low of 4.87 per cent. But most
recently bill demand has slackened, and dealers have become more sensitive
to present high financing costs; in consequence bill rates have
tended to back-up.
Other short-term market rates have also declined. The
generally sticky rates on bankers' acceptances, finance company paper
and commercial paper have all moved lower by approximately 1/8 of a
percentage point, And, in large part reflecting heavy July inflows
but also because of the general reduction in market rates, CD
offering rates have been adjusted downward, with even the 90-day maturity
now paying less than the Regulation Q ceiling rate.

Federal finance. With the completion of this week's
financing, the Treasury will have no further need to enter the
market until late October. Any marked further decline of Government
security yields in the weeks ahead, however, could encourage Treasury
officials to undertake a pre-refunding of some of the sizable volume
of coupon issues that mature in late 1968 and 1969. Also, the already
announced cycle of $100 million additions to weekly bill auctions
will continue through the second Thursday of October.
For the third quarter as a whole net Federal borrowing from
the public will total about $7.3 billion, as the table shows.
While the Federal cash deficit in the fourth quarter is projected to
be even larger than in the third (for seasonal reasons), the weight of
Federal borrowing will actually be more moderate. Quarterly income
tax payments will swell the Treasury's end-of-September balance to
an estimated $8.3 billion, so that most of the October seasonal deficit
can be covered by drawing the balance down. The market impact of the
$5. 5-- $6.0 billion of new money that is expected to be needed in the
fourth quarter should also be moderated because of the probability
that the Treasury will finance this need with tax anticipation bills.
This type of issue is best suited to the sizable repayment of debt
which is expected to develop in the last half of the fiscal year.

The broad outlines of the fiscal 1969 Budget as now projected,
and the actual results for fiscal 1968 (as well as for 1967) are compared
in the table that follows. Three summary versions of the aggregate
fiscal impact are given in the table, (1) the new unified budget,
(2) the Federal sector in the national income accounts, and (3) a
computation of the high-employment NIA budget.
The tentative fiscal year 1969 projection shows the same
deficit of $3.8 billion, both for the new budget and the Federal sector
in the NIA accounts. However, when the NIA receipts are calculated on
the assumption of a steady high-employment GNP model the deficit shrinks
to about $1.0 billion.

The half-year pattern is highly divergent as between the new
budget and the Federal sector in the NIA accounts. For one thing, new
budget data are only available seasonally unadjusted, thus showing
a large deficit in the last half of calendar year 1968 and a surplus
in the first half of calendar 1969. Also, corporate and social
security tax receipts are entered in the NIA accounts on a smooth
accrual basis, whereas the new budget, as presently measured, records
cash flows for these taxes. The collection pattern for these two
types of taxes is highly seasonal and this year it has special irregularities
reflecting both the delay in enacting the surtax bill--with the consequent
need to schedule retroactive tax payments--and an increase in income
ceilings for social security taxes, effective in January 1968.

Exchange markets. The dollar has been consistently strong
in exchange markets against most continental currencies during July
and early August. Though this is a season for adverse changes in the
trade and travel accounts of the U.S. balance of payments and though
U.S. banks have been reducing their liabilities to branches abroad
since July 10, few reports of reserve gains for continental European
central banks have been heard. French official reserves continued
to suffer sizable weekly drains during July. Italian reserve gains
have been much smaller than is usual at this time of year. Demand
for the German mark has been relatively weak, and toward the end of
July demand for the Swiss franc abated.
The pound sterling and the Canadian dollar have been
beneficiaries, along with the U.S. dollar, of the changes in payments
flows that underlie these market developments. The July 6 announce-
ment about negotiations for a sterling-balances safety net and the
July 11 news of better U.K. trade figures for June served to clear
the atmosphere enough to make July the best month for sterling since
the abortive recovery of early 1967. Britain's basic balance of

IV -2
payments is unlikely to show a surplus until 1969; it is therefore
clear that the July gain in the U.K. reserve position net of assistance
reflected private capital inflows of a short-term nature. These
would include shifts in lead-and-lag accounts payable or receivable,
rebuilding of working balances, short-term investments giving high
yields on an uncovered basis, and purchases of U.K. Government bonds,
which had jumped sharply in price on the good trade news and which
are widely expected to appreciate further over the coming year. The
three-month forward discount on the pound has narrowed to about 2 per
cent per annum.
In the case of Canada, the recent exchange market strength
reflected U.S. import buying and further effects of the renewal of
confidence in the Canadian dollar, such as repayments of loans
obtained earlier this year by non-Canadians from Canadian banks.
The unexpected strength of the U.S. dollar cannot yet be
explained in terms of specific types of capital flows. It is signifi-
cant, however, that foreign purchases of U.S. corporate stocks continued
unusually large in June. Further discussion will be found below.
U.S. balance of payments. The broad outlines of the U.S.
balance of payments for the first half year are now reasonably clear,
though hard information is lacking for some important sectors in
the second quarter. The liquidity deficit for the second quarter
as it will be published about the middle of the month was at an annual
rate of about $1 billion, substantially below the first quarter rate

IV -3
of $2-1/2 billion. Before special transactions (given in Appendix C)
there was some deterioration from the first quarter, to an annual
rate of over $4 billion in the second quarter.
More recently, however, a sharp improvement has occurred.
The second quarter deficit before seasonal adjustment was concentrated
in April to a greater extent than usual. After rough allowance for
seasonal variations the May and June liquidity deficits before special
transactions were at considerably reduced rates. In July the early
indicators suggest little or no deficit, before special transactions,
in sharp contrast to the July deficits in 1966 and 1967 which were
each over $500 million.
Euro-dollar funds and official settlements. These develop-
ments with respect to the balance on the liquidity basis were unaffected
by the dramatic changes which have occurred in flows of funds to the
United States through commercial banks abroad, predominantly through
foreign branches of U.S. banks. During the second quarter -- and
expecially strongly in May and June -- total U.S. liquid liabilities
to commercial banks abroad and to other private foreigners increased
by $2.3 billion. After a further increase in the first ten days of
July, liabilities to foreign branches fell by $750 million in the next
three weeks.

IV -4
This reversal of flows is clearly a result of the easing
of U.S. interest rates and the increased availability of CD funds
to banks. In turn it has led to a decline in Euro-dollar interest
rates. Today, August 7, the Euro-dollar call money rate stands at
5-3/4 per cent, compared with 6-1/2 per cent toward the end of June,
and the 3-month rate at 5-7/8 per cent compared with 6-7/8 per cent
then.
The earlier massive inflow reflected both active bidding
for funds in Europe by American banks and the augmentation of supply
by movements out of sterling and the French franc which were both
under severe pressure during May and June. In July the continued
movements out of the French franc have presumably contributed to easing
in the Euro-dollar market.
In conjunction with factors affecting the liquidity balance,
the increase in liabilities to commercial banks and other private
foreigners produced a surplus of $1-1/2 billion in the second quarter
on the official settlements basis. As an increase in the U.S. gold
tranche position in the Fund was offset in good part by a reduction
in U.S. official holdings of convertible currencies, this surplus
meant a decline of $1.4 billion in U.S. liabilities, liquid and
near-liquid, to foreign central banks and governments.
Unlike the flows of Euro-dollar funds, large inflows of
other types of capital have apparently continued in July. During
the first half of the year there were large net acquisitions by

IV -5
foreign investors of U.S. corporate securities, and a sharp slow down
in U.S. investing abroad. It is these changes in capital flows which
have brought improvement in the liquidity balance despite a marked
deterioration in the current account so far this year.
Foreign capital flows to the U.S. In each of the first
two quarters of this year private foreigners invested more than
$1 billion (net) in long-term debt or equity issues of U.S. corpora-
tions (see following table). The total for the half year exceeded the
$2.1 billion invested in these types of assets in the full year 1967,
and was nearly twice the total for 1966. In the same period when U.S.
corporations have been able to sell very large amounts of long-term
debt issues (mainly in the form of convertible debentures) in the
international capital markets on favorable terms, foreign investors
have been buying U.S. corporate stocks in extraordinary volume.
Over the whole postwar period, until the middle of 1967, net foreign
purchases of U.S. corporate stocks were maintained on a relatively
small scale, reaching a peak of $360 million in 1959, and infrequently
exceeding $200 million in a year. In 1967 such pruchases (apart from
the U.K. liquidation) were about $800 million, and in the first half
of this year the total was probably $1-1/4 billion. It is not clear
why this massive inflow has been taking place; two explanations that
have been offered are the increasing activity of aggressive sales

IV -6
organizations in Europe, and a general association with a broad surge
of equity investment in other capital markets as an inflation hedge
and possibly as a hedge against currency devaluations.

In this market atmosphere U.S. companies found ready acceptance
of well over $1 billion of securities placed in foreign markets in the
first half of the year to finance their current and prospective direct
foreign investments. The volume of such placements will most likely
be considerably lower in the second half since major companies have
largely satisfied their financing requirements, and the proceeds of
earlier borrowings can be drawn down. The supply of foreign financing
for U.S. affiliates abroad appears to be ample, but any marked

IV -7
deterioration in U.S. equity markets causes difficulties for the
sale of convertible issues. Up to now the sale of convertible deben-
tures offshore does not appear to have touched off any significant
switching out of existing foreign holdings of U.S. equities, though
some activity of that type might be obscured by the inflow of fresh
funds. It is even possible that the development of a market for
these offerings contributed to a general interest in acquiring U.S.
corporate stocks.
U.S. capital flows abroad. The outflow of U.S. funds for
lending and investment abroad in the first half of the year was very
sharply curtailed by the various control programs, and perhaps also
to some extent by relatively strong demand for investment funds in the
U.S, At this date figures for the second quarter on foreign direct
investments by industrial companies can only be based on fragmentary
evidence, but assuming that this sector rose only moderately over the
very low rate of the first quarter, it seems likely that the U.S.
capital outflow abroad was less than $2 billion in the January-June
period. Since the comparable outflow for the last half of 1967 was
$3.4 billion, this was obviously a major change in the accounts. The
overall U.S. payments outcome for the second half of the year will
depend heavily on whether the outflow remains at this very low rate
or returns to more normal rates.

In the case of direct investments it seems likely that the
second half rate will rise somewhat over the estimated first half rate,
but greater use of the accumulated proceeds of foreign borrowing will
reduce the impact on the balance of payments. After deducting the use
of foreign borrowing, the outflow may be about $1.7 billion for the year,
compared to $2.7 billion on the same basis in 1967. The Commerce Department
regulations require that companies that hold proceeds of foreign borrow-
ings abroad use those proceeds rather than make any investments of U.S.
funds, even though they might have room under their ceilings to do so.
There is also a carry-forward provision in the regulations that would
encourage some savings of allowable ceilings. Since the accumulated un-
used proceeds of foreign borrowings were over $1 billion by the end of
June, and the foreign affiliates themselves may well be in a fairly liquid
position through their own direct borrowings abroad, which have also
risen sharply this year, there is at least a good chance a reduction of
capital flows by $1 billion compared to 1967 can be achieved. The
reduction will fall very largely on Continental Europe.
Bank-reported claims have shown a marked turnaround from moderate
outflows in the last half of 1967 to sizable inflows this year, continu-
ing through June. At the end of June outstanding claims under the FCRP
were$675 million under the ceiling, and the ceiling will decline by
only about $200 million. While a further liquidation of foreign claims
on the scale of the first half rundown is not anticipated neither is
a reversal to sizable outflows. Similarly, short-term assets held abroad
by U.S. non-financial-organizations apart from the unused proceeds of

IV -10
foreign borrowing -- were built up at an unusually high rate at the end
of last year, but have been drawn down in the first half of 1968, pre-
sumably because of the requirements of the Commerce Department controls.
Here again a further reduction on a significant scale seems unlikely,
since balances remaining are probably close to minimum working require-
ments.
Finally, net U.S. purchases of foreign securities, unlike
other forms of investment, continued at a high rate in the first half
of the year and may rise somewhat in the second half. Most of the out-
flow is related to new issues in the United States by Canadian borrowers
and the IBRD. There is also a steady though moderate net flow of in-
vestment into outstanding foreign equity securities, subject to the
Interest Equalization Tax.
Summing up these potentialities for the rest of the year,
the very low estimated net outflow of U.S. private capital in the first
half is not likely to be repeated in the second. Assuming only that the
net reductions of banking claims and other short-term foreign assets
will not continue, the second half outflow would rise by some $800
million over the first half. If there are also increases in the rate
of direct investment (excluding the use of foreign funds) and in pur-
chases of foreign securities, the deterioration might exceed $1 billion.
With respect to private foreign long-term investments in
the United States, the principal question about the second half is

IV -11
whether the rate of purchases of U.S. corporate stocks will be main-
tained. Foreign purchases of these securities began and have con-
tinued when the U.S. market was not rising relative to foreign mar-
kets, but a slowdown in the U.S. economy coupled with further market
declines could cause the inflow to revert to a much lower amount.
Also, there was an unusual inflow of $200 million for foreign direct
investments in the United States in the first half that will not be
repeated. The overall adverse swing from first half to second half
in U.S. and foreign private capital flows -- apart from private for-
eign liquid assets in the United States -- could well be on the order
of $1-1/2 billion, tending to offset the improvement in the liquidity
balance that is expected from gains in trade and other current trans-
actions.

IV -12
U.S. foreign trade. In June the trade balance was in
deficit for the second successive month and for the third time in
four months as imports rose 3-1/2 per cent above the record May level.
Exports also rose but at a lower rate than imports. The export sur-
plus in the first half of the year was at an annual rate of about
$1/4 billion, far below the more than $4 billion rate in the first
half of 1967.
Exports in the second quarter were about 5 per cent higher
than in the first quarter, but most of this rise is attributable to
delays in shipments from March to April caused by the New York port
strike. For May and June together exports were at annual rate of
$32.7 billion (balance of payments basis), only about 1 per cent
higher than the rate in the first four months of the year.

Shipments of agricultural products, which had been relatively
large in the first quarter, fell sharply in May-June. This decline was
more than offset by an increase in exports of nonagricultural commodi-
ties. Deliveries of aircraft, and cars to Canada continued to expand
while sales of machinery picked up noticeably in June. It may be that
the sharp upturn in export orders for machinery last fall is just now
beginning to be realized in higher exports. Shipments of copper, par-
ticularly to the United Kingdom, France, and Italy, also increased as
domestic refineries resumed operation with settlement of the copper
strike in March.
In May-June exports to the EEC countries expanded by 11 per
cent from the rate in the first four months; more than half of the in-
crease was in commodities other than aircraft and copper. Shipments
to Latin America and Japan also rose but more moderately. Aside from
cars, shipments to Canada fell substantially.
Exports of silver, included in the trade data on the balance
of payments basis, increased sharply in the second quarter to an annual
rate of over $300 million, triple the amount sold in 1967. The redemp-
tion of silver certificates for silver bullion by the Treasury Depart-
ment has made available increased quantities of silver for export. De-
mand for silver by London bullion dealers has been heavy -- primarily
as backing for silver certificates which these dealers started issuing
last January. With completion of the redemption program, exports of
silver can be expected to fall sharply in the second half of the year.

IV -14
Imports rose sharply in May and June after remaining fairly
level at a very high rate from January through April. In the second
quarter, imports (which did not appear to be much affected by the
March port strike) were at an annual rate of $33.3 billion (balance
of payments basis), a new record. They were 6 per cent higher than
in the first quarter and 26 per cent larger than a year earlier.
The recent import expansion has been largely in foods, auto-
mobiles, and other consumer goods. Purchases of foreign machinery
held at the high first quarter rate, about in line with the behavior
of total domestic expenditures for such goods. Imports of industrial
supplies, in the aggregate, fell from the very high rate of the first
quarter as copper imports fell and steel imports rose.
Copper imports, after reaching a peak in April -- the month
following the end of the 9-month industry-wide strike -- dropped
sharply in May and again in June to a level approximately equal to
the pre-strike rate. The copper strike is estimated to have resulted
in about $600 million (annual rate) of abnormal copper imports in the
first half of the year.
In contrast, steel imports in the second quarter were about
10 per cent higher than the record rate of the first quarter, despite
a dip in June arrivals resulting from the strike on the St. Lawrence
Seaway. The build-up in inventories of foreign steel in the first
seven months of the year was estimated to be about $400-450 million

IV -15
(annual rate). Despite the recent agreement on a new labor contract
in the steel industry, contractual commitments, renewed exposure of
American steel-using industries to foreign steel, and their reaction
to the recently announced price increases for domestic steel may all
serve to limit the decline now expected in steel imports.
The threat of still another strike -- the longshoremen's
contract expires at the end of September -- is reported to have caused
some acceleration in buying of coffee and sugar and of some items nor-
mally imported heavily in the fall for Christmas sales. The removal
in early April of the quarterly allocation of sugar imports was still
another factor in the heavy arrivals of sugar. The substantial rise
in imports of foods in the second quarter reflects a 20 per cent in-
crease in coffee inventories and higher-than-usual inventories of
sugar.
Exceptionally heavy arrivals of automobiles, both from Canada
and from Europe and Japan, accounted for nearly two-fifths of the in-
crease in total imports from the first to the second quarter. Sales of
foreign cars (other than those from Canada) increased by 22 per cent
in the second quarter and increases in inventories were also sizable.
Arrivals of automobiles and parts from Canada also rose sharply. In
the first half of 1968, an automotive import balance with Canada of
about $160 million (annual rate), was recorded. In 1964, before the
U.S.-Canadian automotive agreement became effective, there had been
an export surplus on such transactions of about $500 million.

The expansion in imports of consumer goods (other than foods
and automobiles) continued to be paced by heavy arrivals of apparel
and footwear. The f.o.b. value of imports of consumer nonfood non-
durables in the second quarter was equal to about 2.3 per cent of
total domestic retail expenditures on such goods, a further increase
over the high ratio of the first quarter.

Foreign trade of other industrial countries. The large spurt
in world trade which occurred in the fourth quarter of 1967 and the
first month or two of 1968 has not continued at the same pace in recent
months. However, in continental Europe expansion of economic activity
is continuing, and is expected to continue even if U.S. demand for
European exports falls off later this year. Consequently, continental
European imports are expected to increase further. Imports of the EEC
countries were running in April -- before the French troubles -- at a
rate 9 per cent higher than in the first half of 1967.

On the other hand, in Britain and Japan policy measures aimed
at restoring payments equilibrium have tended to check the growth of
imports In both countries imports in June were significantly lower than

IV -19
in earlier months. Canadian imports, too, do not appear to be in-
creasing; they leveled off during the spring after a sharp rise up to
February.
U.S. imports, as noted in a previous section, advanced further
in May and June. Strength of import demand in the United States and
Canada beginning last autumn contributed to rapid increases in the
exports of Japan and of continental Europe, and also aided growth of
U.K. exports. EEC exports in April were running 13 per cent
higher than in the first half of 1967. In dollar amount the bulk of this
increase in EEC exports was intra-European -- their exports to countries
in Europe rose 13 per cent -- but they also had a sizable increase in
exports to North America, which showed a 23 per cent rise.

Accompanying the worsening of the U.S. trade balance since
last autumn there have been reductions in trade deficits for Japan,
France, Italy and the Netherlands, and an increase in Canada's export
surplus. The German export surplus has remained very large, with
possibly some tendency toward decrease in recent months. French trade
shifted sharply into deficit in June.

1/ Exports (f.o.b.) less imports (c.i.f.), except for
Canada, for which imports are f.o.b.
a/ Seasonal adjustment estimated by Board staff.United States and
Britain's trade deficit narrowed sharply in June to £50 million,
down from £86 million in both April and May (balance of payments basis).
Most of this sizable improvement was attributable to a 7 per cent decline
in the value of imports. Whereas exports have shown strength this year
in accordance with forecasts made at the time of the devaluation, a steep

IV -21
and unexpected rise in imports had been the major factor casting doubt
on the ability of the new sterling parity to produce the requisite
improvement in Britain's balance of payments.
The June drop in imports was partly due to special factors,
such as anticipation of the Kennedy Round tariff cuts on July 1, and
the disorders in France. On the other hand, imports in June, as in
previous months, may have been inflated by uncertainty over the perma-
nence of the $2.40 parity. Speculative import buying should be greatly
diminished if the confidence that has now begun to return to sterling
is sustained.
Imports of finished manufactured goods and of food, beverages
and tobacco were 6 per cent lower in the second quarter than in the
first, when they had been swollen by the pre-Budget consumer goods boom.
Imports of industrial materials, on the other hand, rose 1 per cent in
the second quarter. The value of total imports was down 1 per cent, and
the volume probably 2 per cent, still comparing the second quarter as a
whole with the preceding quarter.
After the sharp drop from May to June, import volume was
probably still 4 or 5 per cent higher than in June 1967. In terms of
sterling, the total value of imports was up 18 per cent from a year
earlier. The dollar value was up 1 per cent.
British exports in June were 2 per cent higher in value than
in May. As shipments of exports delayed by last autumn's dock strikes
recede into the past, an uptrend is emerging.
In comparison with the third quarter of 1967, before the dock
strikes, the volume of exports this June was up 9 or 10 per cent. As

IV -22
the sterling prices (unit values) of British exports had risen about
6 per cent, the sterling value of total exports was up 17 per cent
from last summer. In dollar terms, unit values were down about 9 per
cent, just about offsetting the volume gain, so that the total dollar
value was virtually unchanged. Volume gains can be expected to continue,
bringing commensurate gains in dollar earnings. There have been sub-
stantial increases in recent months in export orders in such major export-
ing industries as machinery, motor vehicles, and shipbuilding.
Germany's large trade surplus tended to shrink during the first
half of 1968, but the rate of shrinkage was quite slow. In April-May,
the seasonally adjusted surplus averaged $304 million per month (imports
c.i.f.), compared with $345 million per month in the fourth quarter of
1967. June exports and imports were both affected by the French dis-
bances.
German imports continued to rise through May, under the impetus
of expanding domestic demand. After the low point of Germany's 1966-67
recession was reached in the second quarter of last year, industrial
production rose very sharply, with an extra bulge toward the end of the
year stimulated by certain tax considerations connected with the change-
over on January 1 from the turnover tax to the value-added tax. Although
the fourth-quarter average level of industrial production was not sur-
passed until March, imports rose fairly steadily -- though not as
rapidly after the yearend as they had last autumn. In April-May they
were 16 per cent above their average in the first half of 1967.
German exports have risen less rapidly than imports, and in
April-May were up 9 per cent from the level of January-June 1967. Much

IV -23
of the increase in exports was to other European OECD countries, but
in relative terms German exports to North America rose very sharply
(by about 40 per cent) over the same period.
Prospects appear good for a continued increase in German
imports and a further reduction of the trade surplus. After sharp
declines in January, new domestic orders and German industrial pro-
duction showed substantial increases in March and April and moved up
again in May. In its latest assessment of German economic conditions
through May, the Bundesbank has noted an acceleration of the heretofore
quite slow rise of private consumption spending; the latest monthly report
of the Economics Ministry also observes more active consumer spending.
Forecasts of inventory investment and fixed capital outlays have been
raised. Even though a contraction of the Federal budget deficit and
a slackening of the export rise are anticipated for the second half of
this year, German representatives at the EPC meeting in Paris on July 17
said they expected real GNP in 1968 to average between 5 and 5-1/2 per
cent greater than in 1967. Earlier OECD forecasts had put the rise at
4-1/2 per cent, with some slackening after mid-1968. The new prediction
presumably implies a steadier advance.
French trade figures for May and June were seriously distorted
by the national unrest and general strike. Both imports and exports
were depressed in May, but imports recovered rapidly in June while ex-
ports did not. The diapppinting export performance in June is under-
standable in view of the fact that normal production did not resume
until mid-month. The sharp increase in June imports, under

IV -24
these conditions, probably reflected an increase in consumer goods
imports to make up for the stoppage of domestic output, as well as
fears of a devaluation or of import restrictions.
Earlier both exports and imports had been rising, and the
trade deficit -- which had been at its largest in late 1966 -- had been
shrinking.
As of July 1, import quotas were applied to iron and steel,
major household appliances, textiles, motor vehicles, and miscellaneous
other goods. These items, supplied to France mainly by other European
countries, together accounted for about 10 per cent of French imports in
1967. These quotas are scheduled to be removed at the end of this year.
French trade prospects for the remainder of 1968 are uncertain.
The official French forecast is that imports in 1968 will be 13 per cent
larger, in real terms, than in 1967. Exports are predicted to grow by
only 9 per cent. Both forecasts imply very sharp increases ahead, to
compensate for the low May and June levels; these predictions should
perhaps be discounted. The expected export growth is based on a con-
tinuing German recovery and on the effects of export subsidies which
will run through the end of next January. These subsidies, based on labor
content, will at least partly offset the effect of wage increases granted
in June, Moreover, the fact that they will be terminated at the end of
January will tend to shift some exports forward.
Italian imports, as officially recorded, dipped sharply in
the first two months of 1968. Despite partial recovery, they were still
below their fourth-quarter-1967 level in April and May- Exports mean-
while continued to advance.

IV -25
The import dip was partly unreal, due to statistical valuation
problems which caused delay in recording certain foodstuff imports;
partly a reaction after heavy petroleum imports in late 1967 caused by
fears of termination of a subsidy; and partly connected with what seems
to have been a real slowing of the Italian economic expansion. The slow-
ing began early in 1967, to some extent reflecting the German recession.
From the first quarter of 1967 to the first quarter of 1968 Italian
industrial production rose only 6 per cent, after an 11 per cent increase
the year before.
Accompanying the German recovery and the rise in U.S. demand
since mid-1967, Italian exports have risen rapidly during the past twelve
months.
Canada has been a major beneficiary of the rise in U.S. imports
since last autumn. Canada is a supplier of both copper and steel, which
bulked large in U.S. demands. The Canadian-U.S. auto agreement has pro-
duced continuous growth in Canadian exports of autos and parts to the
United States since 1964. More recently, McDonald-Douglas has set up
production facilities in Canada; originally for the DC-9, these will now
provide airframe sections for the new airbus.
Canadian exports to the rest of the world were smaller in the
first half of 1968 than a year earlier, mainly because of smaller wheat
exports.
Canadian imports rose sharply for several months up to February,
but have leveled off since then. Fiscal and monetary restraint have con-
tributed to a slowing in growth of Canadian demand, despite an upswing

IV -26
since last autumn in residential construction activity. However,
industrial production in April-May showed renewed expansion.
Japan, too, has been a heavy exporter to the United States
this year, particularly of steel. As Japanese imports have leveled
off after a strong two-year rise which took them to a peak last November,
a dramatic reversal of last year's deterioration in the Japanese trade
balance has taken place. The leveling off of imports is ascribable to
effects of the credit tightening measures inaugurated last September
and reinforced in January.
As a result of the improvement in Japan's balance of payments,
the first step toward easier credit conditions was taken on August 7
with a lowering of the Bank of Japan's discount rate from 6.205 per cent
to 5.840 per cent. In April-May there was a renewal of the rise in domestic
activity. The expected slowing of Japanese exports to the United States
may restrain the domestic expansion, but moderate growth in Japanese
import demand during the rest of this year is still expected.

APPENDIX A: RECENT HOUSING LEGISLATION*
On August 1, the President signed the Housing and Urban
Development Act of 1968 (Public Law 90-448), the first omnibus housing
legislation in two years. Probably the most comprehensive housing
bill ever passed by the Congress, the 1968 Act is said to represent an
initial 3-year installment in the President's announced program to
build and rehabilitate enough dwellings within the next decade to
replace substantially all housing now deemed to be below standard, and
to provide adequate dwellings for all families.
In terms of this and related objectives, the Act provides a
variety of new programs designed to strengthen or supplement private
market operations. Among these new programs are (a) HUD monthly grants--
extended on behalf of occupants--to mortgage lenders that finance
private housing to be owned or rented by lower income families. Eligible
occupants, otherwise unable to meet going market mortgage interest rates
or housing rents, will pay reduced occupancy outlays calculated on the
basis of mortgages bearing interest rates as low as 1 per cent; (b) HUD
reinsurance or insurance to backstop private property (riot) and flood
insurance; (c) HUD guarantees of obligations issued by private developers
to help finance the development of new communities; and (d) FHA mortgage
insurance for vacation homes and nonprofit hospitals. The Act also
includes substantial additional authorizations for such existing Federal
programs as urban renewal and low-rent public housing. Finally, the Act
seeks to improve the structure of the mortgage market by reconstituting
FNMA's secondary market operations and by liberalizing Federal savings
and loan association operations and national bank real estate lending.
The provisions of the Act seem likely to give only a very
limited net stimulus to residential construction outlays during the
current fiscal year. Any estimate of the aggregate short-run impact
is obviously hazardous in view of uncertainties and lags involving
program appropriations and implementation as well as the limited first-
year authorizations. The impact of the rigid housing-cost and occupant-
income limitations applicable to certain new programs also has to be
taken into account. These and other considerations suggest that the Act
by itself may at best generate a net of 50,000 or so additional public
and private housing starts in fiscal 1969. This would imply roughly a
4 per cent increase in total starts above the volume that might other-
wise be expected, involving perhaps no more than $0.5 billion in
additional expenditures for residential structures during fiscal 1969.

Section, Division of Research and Statistics.

A -2
The actual degree of net stimulus will likely depend also on the avail-
ability of mortgage funds in coming months; the easier the mortgage
market, the less reliance private builders will probably place on the
programs of public supplementary assistance provided in the Act.
Coupled with earlier legislation on the books, however, the
cumulative stimulus of the 1968 Act will undoubtedly be more substantial
into the 1970's. Indeed, the Department of Housing and Urban Development
has projected as much as a five-fold expansion over the next decade in
the annual number of new or rehabilitated public and private dwellings
receiving Federal cash assistance. Assuming full funding and implementa-
tion of all new and existing programs, HUD estimates that the total number
of assisted new and rehabilitated units would reach 700,000 to 800,000
yearly by the late 1970's. Relative to total housing units to be started
or rehabilitated, Federally aided dwellings would increase from the
current share of about a twelfth to almost a fourth.
Stepped-up Federal involvement in the housing market in
coming years would be consistent with the housing goals reaffirmed in
the Act by the Congress for a decent home and a suitable living environ-
ment for every American family. In that connection, a novel provision
in the legislation requires the President, by early next year, to submit
a plan to the Congress for substantial achievement of these goals within
the next decade. Then in January 1970 and each year thereafter, the
President must report on progress made toward these 10-year goals. He
must also project mortgage needs and prospects for the coming calendar
year, including "an analysis of the monetary and fiscal policies of the
Government ...required to achieve the objectives of the plan and the
impact upon the domestic economy of achieving the plan's objectives for
such periods.. ."
FNMA reorganization. As of September 1, 1968, FNMA will be
reorganized under the Act in order to provide greater operational flex-
ibility for its secondary market functions. Operating under HUD
regulation, a new Government sponsored private corporation--retaining
the name of FNMA--will take over FNMA's present secondary market functions
which are now conducted as a trust fund under mixed Treasury-private
ownership. As a private corporation, the new FNMA will thereby become
independent of the Federal budget in acquiring mortgages under its
secondary market operations, which have expanded often during the very
periods that over-all Federal expenditures have come under growing
restraint. With 100 per cent private ownership, FNMA's reorganized
operations will be excluded from Federal budget expenditures and financ-
ing totals in the new accounting system. Presumably, these changes will
allow FNMA to give somewhat greater countercyclical support to the
mortgage market than it has already done to date.

A -3
A successor Federal corporation, to be known as the Government
National Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae), will be set up to retain
FNMA's present special assistance and management and liquidating functions.
In order to broaden sources of funds available for mortgage lending, GNMA
will be able to guarantee participation certificates or other securities
issued against pools of Government underwritten mortgages set aside by
GNMA, FNMA, Federal savings and loan associations, national banks, or
other approved lenders. The extent of such participation sales at any
given time will, of course, depend heavily on the attractiveness of the
yields generated by the pooled loans.
Private lenders. The Act provides for greater flexibility
within the primary mortgage market by broadening the powers of Federal
savings and loan associations and by liberalizing the real estate lending
authority of national banks.
A number of new powers authorized for Federal savings and
loan associations furnish the basis for greater ultimate diversification
of their assets and liabilities, and hence for greater potential cycli-
cal stability in savings inflows and mortgage lending. Under the Act,
Federal S&L's can (a) use such terms as "savings deposits" in lieu of
"savings shares"; (b) accept deposits for fixed periods of time and
issue certificates of deposits, presumably under a creditor-debtor
relationship; (c) issue subordinated notes, bonds, debentures, and other
obligations and securities (except capital stock), all of which would be
ineligible for FSLIC insurance; (d) invest in time deposits, certifi-
cates, or accounts of any FDIC-insured bank; (e) make repair, equipping,
alteration, or improvement loans of up to $5,000 against any type of
real property fixture; (f) finance mobile homes and vacation homes; and
(g) invest up to 1 per cent of their assets in AID guaranty loans to
developing countries outside Latin America as well as inside Latin
America (as already permitted). Some of these changes--such as the use
of "savings deposits" long sought by the industry--will take effect
only after implementation of FHLBB regulations and amendment of associa-
tion charters, a process likely to span one or more months. Issuance of
subordinated securities would obviously depend in addition on how favor-
able a market reception an association's offerings would receive in
competition with other capital market borrowers.
For national banks, the Act broadens the incentive as well
as the capacity for mortgage investment. It (a) extends the present
24-month limit on construction loans to 36 months; (b) clarifies bank
authority to purchase participations in existing mortgages in addition
to newly-made loans; and (c) codifies an earlier ruling of the Comptroller
of the Currency liberalizing real estate lending investment potential.
In connection with (c), the new law states that when a bank makes a loan
to any type of borrower and looks primarily for repayment from the
borrower's income or relies on non-mortgage security as collateral, but
in addition also takes a mortgage, the loan shall be classed as an

A -4
ordinary non-real-estate loan rather than as a conventional mortgage.
Such classification thereby exempts the loan from the statutory limits
on real estate mortgages applicable to aggregate bank holdings (the
greater of capital and surplus, or 70 per cent of time and savings
deposits), maximum maturity (25 years), and maximum loan-to-value ratio
(80 per cent); Federally-underwritten mortgages have always been exempt
from most of these limitations.

APPENDIX B: ANNUAL REVISION OF NATIONAL INCOME AND PRODUCT*
The 1968 annual revision of the national income and product
figures, based on newly available benchmark data, changed earlier
estimates--including the general contour of developments--relatively
little. Gross national product, personal income, and corporate profits
were revised up slightly throughout the revision period, which extends
back to the first quarter of 1965. Revisions in the GNP price deflator
were small and so the upward revisions in current dollar GNP were
reflected in the constant dollar figures. GNP in current dollars in
1967 is now estimated at $789.7 billion, $4.7 billion or .6 per cent
higher than before; the largest upward revision, .8 per cent, was for
the fourth quarter of 1966.

The new figures generally show slightly larger quarterly
gains in the last half of 1965 and throughout 1966 than the previous
figures did, and slightly smaller gains throughout 1967. In general
the revised figures for 1968-I indicate larger increases than before.
Revisions of the quarter-to-quarter changes in the expendi-
ture components of GNP generally were also relatively small, with the
signficant revisions concentrated in three components. Business fixed
investment over the last three years is now somewhat larger. Inventory
accumulation by nonfarm businesses throughout most of the period was somewhat
faster than indicated earlier. Somewhat larger quarter-to-quarter
increases also are now shown for State and local government purchases
in the last half of 1965 and in 1966.
The upward revision in personal income was largely in
interest income, rental income, and business and professional proprietors'
income. The wage and salary income component was relatively unaffected.
The revision in personal income carried through to disposable income and,
with personal consumption expenditures changed little (actually lowered
slightly through 1966), the earlier estimates of personal saving were
raised a bit, as were the ratios of personal saving to disposable
personal income. The fraction of disposable income saved in 1966 is
now estimated at 6.4 per cent, .5 percentage point higher than indicated
by the previous figures, and the already high rate for 1967 as a whole
was raised by .3 percentage point to 7.4 per cent, with the ratio for
the final quarter of the year now at 7.8 per cent. In 1968-I, at 7.1
per cent, the ratio was again .5 percentage point higher than indicated
before. Preliminary estimates for 1968-II indicate a 7.7 per cent
saving rate, almost as high as in 1967-IV.
The revised figures and changes for gross national product
and related items are shown in the attached tables. These tables,
which are the ones regularly carried in the "Greenbook" with the GNP
write-up, also contain the Board's newly revised manufacturing capacity
utilization rates and revised industrial production and housing starts
figures for 1968-II.
