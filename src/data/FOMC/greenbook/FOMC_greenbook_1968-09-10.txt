CURRENT ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL CONDITIONS

I- 1
SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK
Outlook for economic activity
The rise in over-all economic activity is expected to be
considerably less vigorous this quarter than in April-June, largely
as a result of a sharply lower rate of steel and other inventory accu-
mulation. Retail sales,however, have been quite strong thus far this
summer. In the fourth quarter, increases in both final sales and in-
ventory building are likely to be smaller, with little rise in real
GNP. Some deceleration in the rate of price advance also is anticipated
by the fourth quarter.
The anticipated slackening in economic activity reflects the
expected impact of fiscal restraint, as well as the lagged effects of
tight monetary conditions, and the post-steel settlement inventory
adjustments. The effects of the recent change in fiscal stance has not
been apparent in most business indices as yet. While available data
indicate strengthen consumer buying thus far, it is probable that by the
fourth quarter several months of slower growth in disposable income will
have dampened expansion in consumer demand. The recent fiscal package
also will reduce the stimulus from rising Federal expenditures in the
second half of this year. The deficit, NIA basis, was at rate of
about $9,5 billion in the first half of the year; in the second half,
the deficit should be reduced to about $6 billion by the increase in
tax collections and further tapering off of the rise in Federal outlays.

I-2
Changes in other major sectors will contribute little to
growth in the rest of this year: residential construction is expected
to be maintained at about the rate of the last two quarters (as starts
dip and begin to rise again) and figures from the new Commerce-SEC sur-
vey indicate that investment in plant and equipment will recover in the
third quarter, but only to the first quarter level, and show little
further increase in the fourth.
Outlook for resource use and prices
Liquidation is now underway in steel inventories and this
is expected to continue into the fourth quarter. Over coming month,,
expectations are that growth in private demands, production, incomes,and
employment will slacken further and the unemployment rate is likely
to rise gradually to about 4 per cent. In addition, the rate of
capacity utilization in manufacturing is expected to be reduced further.
Although the expansionary effects of new wage agreements for the remainder
of the year will be more limited than earlier because of the smaller
number of workers involved, the pattern of 7 per cent or more in first-
year wage increases is likely to continue to exert strong upward pressure
on unit labor costs and to curtail profit prospects.
The wholesale industrial price average was unchanged in August
and the number of classes of products that were stable or showed declines
remained large for the third month in a row. Selective advances in
domestic steel mill products will contribute directly to a slight increase
in September in the average level of wholesale commodity prices, and new

I -3
auto prices are also expected to be higher this autumn. On the other
hand, actual and prospective increases both here and abroad in the
supply of farm products and food are exerting downward pressure on
the wholesale price level. These developments should also limit
further increases in the consumer price index, which rose rapidly in
June and July.
Demands for credit
The abatement of business credit demands appears to be having
relatively more of an effect so far on capital markets than on banks.
Business loan demands on banks may remain near their June-August pace
in September, but moderate substantially thereafter. One factor
bolstering loan demands is the recent tax legislation. Corporate
income tax payments are expected to be much larger in September than
in any earlier month of the year except June, and to exceed payments
of September 1967 by about $1.5 billion. Apart from any such tax-
related borrowing, however, the expected slower pace of business activity
between now and year-end, including a reduced rate of inventory
accumulation, is expected to lead to smaller short-term credit demands
of business.
Expectations of declining long-term interest rates may have
also contributed to maintenance of business loan demands on banks,
while corporate bond offerings have been reduced. Corporate bond
issues are expected to continue at around the recent moderate pace
over the next few months. Not only will fund requirements probably drop

I-4
off, but, in view of their improved liquidity position and the availability
of bank credit, corporations are also in a relatively good position to
handle such needs without heavy reliance on bond markets.
In contrast to the corporate bond market, municipal offerings
are likely to continue near their recent record pace, bolstered in part
by sizable industrial revenue bond offerings. Some issuers may decide
to postpone scheduled offerings, however, in view of the advanced level
of rates and the congested near-term calendar.
These demand conditions in prospect suggest that corporate
bond yields are likely to edge down over the months ahead. The major
factor that could push such yields up would be development of
expectations that interest rates were near their bottom; this could
lead to some return of major industrial borrowers to the market. In
contrast, technical conditions in the municipal market suggest the
possibilities of some interest rate increases over the short run,
although over the longer-run such yields may tend to decline, given
no dramatic shifts in the business outlook. The potential weakness
in the municipal market reflects substantial accumulated inventory
of unsold securities combined with the continuing large volume of
new offerings. This same potential exists in the Government market,
though probably to a lesser degree, for the volume of coupon issues
in dealer hands remains unusually large, and the cost of carry negative.

I-5
However, new Treasury cash borrowing is not expected until the last half
of October (and will probably take the form of tax bills), and new
coupon issues are not likely to come to market until announcement of the
mid-November refunding.
Supply of funds
While net savings inflows to thrift institutions may pick
up a bit in the period immediately ahead, it will likely remain below
year-earlier levels. With mortgage portfolio repayments continuing to
run modestly ahead of last year, total cash flows to savings and loan
associations and savings banks could be large enough to encourage some
further increases in new mortgage commitment activity particularly if
thrift institutions remain interested in locking up the high prevailing
mortgage yields.
Inflows of consumer-type time and savings deposits at banks
are expected to continue at close to the recent moderate pace unless
there should be a significant further drop in market yields. Negotiable
CD's, which have been the major contributor to the July-August upsurge
in commercial bank time deposits, are expected to show only a small
further rise in the coming weeks unless loan demand should be unexpectedly
strong. Outstanding CD's at New York and Chicago banks have shown
little net change recently and the rate of growth at banks outside
these cities has tapered off. While no substantial run-off is
anticipated over the tax period, banks undoubtedly would be able to
recoup any such attrition rapidly if it did develop.

I-6
Private demand deposits are expected to show relatively moderate
growth in the weeks ahead, continuing the recent slowdown. In part, this
would reflect the further unwinding of some of the temporary influences
contributing to rapid monetary growth earlier--such as the surge in stock
market activity, heavy bank financing of securities dealer inventories,
and the decline in U.S. Government deposits--but moderation in the pace
of economic expansion generally would also be a factor.
Thus, in contrast to the July-August period, changes in supplies
of funds during the period just ahead would seem unlikely to contribute
to any tendency to move market yields down further from their recent
rather stable levels.
International developments
After three months of near balance on the liquidity basis
(measured before special transactions) a large deficit in the balance of
payments reoccurred in August; preliminary and partial weekly data indicate
a deficit for that month of over $700 million, well in excess of the average
for the month in recent years. We have not been able to explain the improve-
ment in the May-July period on the basis of available data, nor are we now
able to explain the reversal in August. Perhaps too much stress should
not be put on this latest reversal, though it certainly puts a damper on
optimism about the outcome for the year.
There was a modest improvement in the trade balance in July
on a seasonally adjusted basis. A major improvement in the trade balance
in the remaining months of the year is still a reasonable hope.

I- 7
Imports should fall off as the anticipated tapering in the growth of
domestic demand occurs, and because of the disappearance of certain
special factors tending to produce abnormally high imports in the
first six months. Exports in January-June were about 7.5 per cent above
the rate of the last half of 1967 and hopefully will continue to increase
at a healthy rate.
On the capital side it is difficult to see any overall improvement
on the first-half performance. While direct investment outflows will
probably decline, this could be more than offset by a swing in bank
lending. Outstanding U.S. bank credit to foreigners was reduced about
$800 million through July. Some of this reduction was seasonal but a
fair-sized net outflow, seasonally adjusted, could occur during the last
five months, without violating the guidelines. The change in net flows
from the first to the last half of the year could therefore be substantial.
On direct investments, we apparently had a very considerable
outflow in the first half of the year, and if the controls are effective,
the last half should show a smaller use of funds from the United States.
Recently released data on plant and equipment expenditures of foreign
affiliates of U.S. companies are somewhat reassuring; the continuation of
only small year-to-year increases is contemplated in 1968 and 1969, which
would be entirely consistent with a continuing reduction in the amount of
financing from U.S. sources.

I-8
So far this year the underlying balance of payments deficit
has not involved a financing problem. In fact, there has been an
official settlements surplus as U.S. banks increased their liabilities
to foreign branches by over $3.0 billion. It seems highly unlikely
that this flow will continue at this rate, if it continues at all.
Thus, the problem of financing the U.S. deficit may come to the fore
again.
To the foregoing uncertainties, which are probably apparent
to most sophisticated market observers, has been added the speculation
over possible revaluation of the mark. Although such a revaluation
would strengthen weak currencies, anticipatory speculation inevitably
drains reserves from countries whose payments position is weakest.
It seems clearer than ever that continued close cooperation among
monetary authorities will be needed to finance reserve changes brought
about by speculative short-term capital flows in ways that will abate
rather than increase the speculative fever.

THE ECONOMIC PICTURE IN DETAIL
The Nonfinancial Scene
Gross national product. Although hard facts on recent and
current economic activity are still scarce, staff estimates indicate
that expansion in the economy is now slowing, and will slow further
in the fourth quarter. The deceleration reflects the combined impact
of reduced inventory investment, the tax surcharge and curtailed Federal
expenditures. GNP in current dollars is expected to increase by $12
billion this quarter, and by about $9 billion in October-December.
These changes correspond to annual rates of growth in real GNP of 1.3 per
cent and 0.4 per cent, compared to about 6 per cent in the first half
of the year. Prices in the private economy, as measured by the GNP
deflator, are expected to rise somewhat less rapidly as the growth in
economic activity eases.
The slowing this summer in total economic activity is not a
reflection of the surtax, which took effect on withholdings in mid-July.
Indeed, the rise in final demand this quarter is expected to be
exceptionally strong, exceeding that of any recent quarter except the
first. Consumption expenditures will increase substantially even if
retail sales in August and September level off at the advanced July
rate. In addition, increases in outlays for housing and for plant
and equipment are likely. Diminished GNP growth for the quarter is
thus largely attributable to an anticipated large downward swing

II -2
in inventory accumulation. Although business stocks as a whole are
projected to continue to grow, accumulation is likely to be reduced
by some $5 billion from the high rate of accumulation in April-June,
when acceleration in inventory building reflected in part a large rise
in steel stocks prior to the wage settlement.
In the fourth quarter, the income drain resulting from the
surtax is likely to weaken growth in consumer expenditures appreciably,
and, since little change is projected in either fixed investment or
Federal spending, the rise in fnnal sales will be considerably reduced
and inventory accumulation will be curtailed further. The large
reduction in steel production following the contract settlement will
adversely affect incomes directly. And secondary declines in production
and income may well begin before the end of the year.
Retail sales rose very strongly in July--up 3 per cent from
June, according to advance estimates--and have apparently continued
at close to the July rate in August. Although unit sales of new
U.S.- made cars slackened in August from their extremely high July
rate, sales of new domestic autos in the quarter appear likely to
average 8.6 million compared to an annual rate of 8.44 million in
April-June. At the same time, the rise in nondurable goods expenditures
appears to be one of the strongest since early 1966, compensating
in part for the weak performance in the second quarter. These
increases have taken place despite the fact that personal income is
now advancing at a rate considerably below that of last quarter. The
surtax began to reduce pay-checks in the second half of July, and

the increase in spendable income this quarter is expected to be one
of the smallest in recent years. The saving rate in the third
quarter is expected to average 6.6 per cent--down 1 percentage
point from the very high second quarter rate.
The increase in personal income is likely to be further slowed
in the fourth quarter and the rise in disposable income should just
about match the small rise in the third quarter. Earnings of production
workers in manufacturing are likely to be affected by cuts in hours
and employment as inventory adjustments continue and many earners
will be paying social security taxes in the fourth quarter of this
year for the first time because of the higher statutory level of earnings
subject to tax--a not inconsiderable bite out of spendable income; since
the tax rate is now 4-1/2 per cent of taxable earnings. Some further
reduction in the saving rate is anticipated for the fourth quarter,
but on balance the slow growth of disposable income is likely to be
more fully reflected than in the third quarter in a smaller rise in
consumption expenditures.
A net reduction in inventories of steel and autos (which
together accounted for about half of the investment in nonfarm
inventories in the second quarter) is likely this quarter. Steel
inventories are expected to decline modestly, since the liquidation
of steel stocks did not begin until August, and the high level of
auto sales should result in a larger than seasonal reduction of auto
stocks. Inventories in other areas in general are expected to increase
in line with final sales, but the recent strength in retail sales may

II -4
also reduce stocks at some retailers (such as apparel and general
merchandise). In the fourth quarter, the run-down in steel inventories
will be much larger than in the third quarter, so that even if stocks
"back-up" in other lines as a result of weak sales, total accumulation
should drop further.
Housing starts, according to revised estimates, have been
rising somewhat faster in recent months than previously had been
estimated. The revised second quarter starts rate, plus a sharp
spurt in July, indicates that expenditures for residential construction
in the current quarter will be somewhat above the previous period.
However, the July starts apparently reflected some non-recurrent
factors of strength, and a decline in starts in August and September
is still expected to reduce the quaeterly rate somewhat below that in
April-June. Improving credit conditions should result in a rising
rate of starts before the end of the fourth quarter, but probably
too late to raise the fourth quarter average rate significantly above
the third quarter. Expenditures for housing construction in the
fourth quarter should be maintained close to the level of the second
and third quarters.
The recently released official survey of intentions to
invest in new plant and equipment suggests a smaller rise in the second
half of the year, and particularly in the fourth quarter, than the May
survey had shown. A much sharper dip in outlays apparently took place
in the second quarter than was indicated formerly (or is reflected in
the current official estimates of GNP) but the decline is expected to
be recovered in the third quarter. Both third and fourth quarter

II -5
fixed investment is now expected to increase little from the rate in
the first quarter of the year. Outlays in both the manufacturing
and commercial sectors are expected by business to be appreciably
lower at the end of the year than previously reported.
No further rise after July (when the Federal pay-raise
operated to increase spending) is anticipated for either defense
or nondefense purchases of goods and services except for CCC
commodity loans,which because of record crops are exceeding January
Budget estimates. A leading indicator of defense expenditures--"gross
national defense obligations incurred outside the Federal budget"--
leveled off several months ago, indicating that the peak may already
have been reached in defense procurement. Total Federal expenditures
(NIA basis) in the third quarter are estimated at a rate of about $185.0
billion, which is close to the rate now estimated for the entire
fiscal year; a bulge in fourth quarter non-defense expenditures reflects
CCC outlays.
The Federal deficit is expected to decline from a rate of over
$10 billion in the second quarter to between $6 and $6.5 billion in the
second half of the year. (The drop would be larger, except that declining
corporate profits are projected to offset some of the increase in receipts
that otherwise would result from the surtax.) Owing to the retroactive
feature of the personal income surcharge and a rise in social security
taxes, a substantial further increase in tax receipts will occur
early next year.

Industrial production. In August, industrial production is
tentatively estimated to have declined about 2 points from the preli-
minary July level of 165.3, reflecting a 25 per cent cutback in steel
output following the labor contract settlement. The August drop in
steel was especially severe compared to contract settlements in 1963 and
1965, as shown in the table. In 1963 and 1965, the decline in steel
production was spread over a four month period, and amounted to 1.7
points and 2.3 points, respectively, in the total index. The largest
monthly decline in those periods was in September 1965 and amounted to
1 point in the total index. In both 1963 and 1965, industrial production
excluding steel was rising (see table). In August 1968, however, there
is little indication (on the basis of incomplete data) of any marked
upward movement in other segments of the index.

With steel consuming industries working off inventories built
up prior to the contract settlement, steel production in September will
probably continue close to the reduced rate reached in the last week
of August and for the month as a whole will be down about 7 per cent
from August.
Recovery in industrial production from the June 1967 low
was not limited to the steel industry, as shown in the table. Output
increases were widespread among other industries. The .6 point
estimated increase in the total index from June to July 1968 was the
result of a further rise in output of materials including steel. In
August auto assemblies, after allowance for the model changeover period,
were about unchanged from the July rate. Output of other consumer
goods and business equipment probably changed little, and, as mentioned
earlier, there are no indications of any marked change either up or
down to offset or accentuate the indicated decline in iron and steel
output.

Capacity utilization. The August rate of manufacturing
capacity utilization is now estimated to be about 83 per cent, down
sharply from the 84.5 per cent recorded in July. The decline is the
result of reduced steel production.
Most manufacturing industries appear to have considerable
unused capacity. Aircraft, motor vehicle, petroleum and rubber
industries are exceptions.

Retail sales. August weekly retail figures suggest that sales
last month continued at about the high July level. July had surged
3,0 per cent above June, for the largest month-to-month gain since mid-
1966. In August there apparently was no net gain, but this in itself
suggests strength since large month-to-month increases in this series
are often followed by some decline in the next month.

II -11
The July gain had been greater for durables (4.8 per cent)
than for nondurables (2.1 per cent), but within the nondurables group,
general merchandise stores showed unusual strength (5.4 per cent). Weekly
figures suggest that in August there continued to be greater strength in
durables than in nondurables, which may have declined slightly.
Stronger sales in the automotive group, despite the decline in unit
auto sales, appear to have offset lower sales in other durable goods
categories. (In July the automotive group had also moved ahead more
strongly than other durable goods categories.) Among nondurable goods,
the food group in August may have been about even with July while general
merchandise may have declined somewhat.

Unit sales and stocks of autos, Dealer sales of new domestic
autos in August were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 8.6 million
units compared with 9.1 million in July and 7.0 million a year earlier.
The August level of sales was about the same as the average for the
first seven months of 1968. Stocks of new cars declined about seasonally
from the advanced end of July level, but were about one-third above
a year earlier. However, the supply of new cars is estimated to have
been equal to about 48 days of sales, not much above the 45 days a year
earlier. The larger dealer inventories, price cuts available at
model change-over time, and anticipated price increases for the 1969
model have been sustaining forces in the auto market.
Consumer credit. The use of consumer instalment credit con-
tinued to increase in July. Extensions, that is credit granted during
the month, reached an all time high of nearly $7.7 billion--a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of $92 billion. This July spurt reflected
increased borrowing for all major purposes: autos, other consumer
durables, personal loans, and home repair and modernization.
Although repayments on consumer instalment debt also moved
up to a new record level during July, the even stronger growth in
extensions produced a net increase of $9.3 billion in outstandings
(seasonally adjusted annual rate), the highest rate of increase for
instalment credit outstanding in any month since November 1965.
The present increase, however, is still well below the record rise
of $8.9 billion (annual rate) in April 1965, a figure that was even
larger relative to consumer expenditures than in the current period.

II -13
Consumer buying expectations. The Census Consumer Buying
Expectations Survey, taken in early July after the passage of the sur-
tax but before the increased withholdings took effect, suggests a
continuation of the present high level of demand for durables and houses
despite some deterioration in respondents' evaluation of their income
situation.
The survey suggests that sales of all new automobiles
(foreign and domestic) will be at an annual rate of 9.2 million units
in the final quarter of this year and the first quarter of 1969. The
fourth quarter forecast is below the current unusually high rate of
sales but consistent with our projection of sales of 8.25 million U.S.-
made automobiles in the final quarter of the year. Plans to buy used
cars declined from April but are still slightly above a year ago.
The index of expected expenditures for houses, at 117.9, is
up strongly both from April, 114.7, and a year ago, 106.6. Much of
the increase reflects the expectation of paying more for a house. In
addition, the probability of a household planning to purchase a house
in the next 6 months was 5 per cent above the figure a year earlier.
On the other hand, the index of expected expenditures for household
durables showed no significant change from April, and was about 1 per
cent above a year ago. This index has shown very little change in any
of the 7 surveys for which it is available.
The index of family income expectations for the next year
declined for the second survey in a row, as optimism decreased among
families with incomes under $5,000. These families represent over one

II -14
third of the sample. Families considered their change in income from a
year ago less favorable than a similar year-over-year comparison in
the second quarter, but their income evaluation was still well avove
the same comparison for the third quarter of 1967.
This new Census survey has yet to establish its usefulness
as a leading indicator. Since the series was changed in January 1967,
the widely followed component index for expected purchases of new cars--
which had been the best component of the 1959-1966 survey--has incorrectly
indicated the direction of movement in the quarter following the
survey about half of the time. Apparently, the new procedure of asking
respondents to assign a weight from 0 to 100 to their expenditures
plans is not adding to the reliability of the series.

Durable goods orders and shipments. Manufacturers new orders
for durable good in July showed an increase of 0.5 per cent from the
June level. But this rise resulted entirely from a sharp increase in
aircraft orders and durable orders excluding aircraft declined. On
the other hand, durable goods shipments increased by 3.1 per cent in
July--to a record level.
Although there were offsets within each group, new orders
declined for primary metals (iron and steel was down 13 per cent) and
fabricated metals. A 25 per cent rise in aircraft orders resulted
in an increase in the transportation and in the defense products groupings
(which includes aircraft). Orders declined for consumer durables and
for the machinery and equipment groupings, although orders for
machinery and equipment remained above the level prevailing in early
1968.
Unfilled orders declined for the second straight month.
Declines were widespread but the sharpest drop occurred at iron
and steel manufacturers.
Manufacturers' inventories. In July the book value of
inventories at manufacturers increased $295 million from a June level
which had been revised up to show an increase of $113 million. The
July increase was less than two-thirds of the average monthly increase
in the second quarter.
Although stocks rose at both durable and nondurable
manufacturers, the bulk of the increase occurred in the latter group.
Food and chemical manufacturers showed the largest increases in the
nondurable group. Among the durable goods, holdings in electrical machinery,

II -16
consumer durable goods and defense products increased. Inventories
held by steel and machinery and equipment producers declined.
Both durable and nondurable goods shipments increased
substantially in July. Consequently, the over-all inventory
shipments ratio fell to 1.66, the lowest level since mid-1966.
Manufacturers' capital appropriations. The latest National
Industrial Conference Board's survey indicates that in the second
quarter manufacturers' net new appropriations increased 2 per cent from
the first quarter level. However, the second quarter level of these
appropriations remained below the average for 1967.
Since capital expenditures by manufacturers remained
at the first quarter's level--the lowest since the first quarter of 1966--
the backlog of unspent appropriations increased. At current levels,
the backlog is the highest since the fourth quarter of 1966.
The increase in total appropriations resulted from offsetting
movements at durable and nondurable manufacturers. Durable manufacturers
increased their appropriations by 5 per cent while nondurable
manufacturers appropriations showed a slight decline. Both groups,
however, increased their backlogs of unspent appropriations.
Anticipated expenditures for plant and equipment. The August
Commerce-SEC Survey indicates that firms have revised downward signi-
ficantly their anticipated expenditures on plant and equipment from
the levels indicated in the May survey, (These data are confidential
until released, either September 6 or early the following week.) The

II -17
latest survey, the first since the enactment of the surtax, now
reports the prospective increase in plant and equipment expenditures
for the year 1968 at only 4.4 per cent; the May survey had indicated
an increase of 6.7 per cent.

The final estimate for the second quarter now indicates that
actual outlays declined by $2.1 billion from the first quarter whereas
the May survey had suggested a decline of only $0.3 billion. Declines
by manufacturing firms accounted for almost all of this shortfall.
Manufacturers had expected to increase their outlays in the second
quarter, but these actually declined by more than $0.5 billion.
Both manufacturers and all firms, taken together, now
anticipate that this shortfall will be recouped in the third quarter.
However, for the total, indicated expenditures in the second half of
the year will be only slightly above the first quarter; the fourth
quarter increase is anticipated to be only $250 million.

II -18
Revision of plans to purchase new plant and equipment have
not been substantial in the other sectors, except for the "comercial
and other" group. Utilities still expect lower outlays in the second
half while anticipated expenditures by railroads have been revised
upward. However, anticipated outlays by the "commercial and other"
group--a series which is subject to considerable revision--have been
revised down almost $1 billion for the fourth quarter.
Construction and real estate. Seasonally adjusted new
construction put in place--revised upward somewhat for both June and
July--edged higher in August, but remained slightly below the peak
reached last February. Private nonresidential construction expenditures,
in a downtrend since February, apparently changed little in August.
However, residential construction moved temporarily higher, reflecting
in part a much greater than expected reversal in the rate of housing
starts in July. Also, public construction outlays rose further to a
new record in August.

Private housing starts, which had declined further in June,
soared above the 1.5 million annual rate in July, reflecting mainly an
advance of four-fifths in the Northeast states from a reduced rate in
June. Particular strength was reported in the New York City area, where
excavation was begun for a few exceptionally large apartment projects,
some with building permits issued nearly a year ago,
A major factor in the surge in the Northeast states probably
was the long-anticipated one-time increase in usury ceilings, effective
July 1, in New York and New Jersey where builders were apparently held
back pending clearance by lenders of loans under the higher permissible
rates now in effect. Another factor was an unusual increase in the
number of working days from 20 in June to 22 in July this year--just
the opposite of the usual pattern-for which no direct adjustment is
incorporated by the Census Bureau in the starts series.
While single-family units also participated in the July starts
advance, the particularly volatile multifamily starts series about
matched the record 1963 level and accounted for 42 per cent of total
starts.
Seasonally adjusted residential building permits, which
include an allowance for working days, declined 4 per cent in July.
Multifamily permits slipped by 8 per cent from a relatively high rate.
Single-family permits, after a three month decline, edged slightly
higher. Unlike starts, among the individual regions only the West
posted an advance over the June rate of permits,

1/ Seasonally adjusted annual rates; preliminary.
During June, the latest month for which data are available,
sales of new homes by speculative builders increased 5 per cent
(seasonally adjusted annual rate). But in the second quarter as a
whole, sales were down somewhat further from the first quarter owing
to the still relatively limited supply of new houses available for sale
under the conditions of gradually increasing restraint which had
prevailed in the residential mortgage market for more than a year.
Indications since the mid-June passage of the fiscal package
of possible easing in underlying mortgage market conditions have buoyed
hopes of a sustained recovery in housing activity before the year end.
These hopes have been strengthened recently by the brighter inflow
expectations of some intermediaries, some reduction in liquidity require-
ments by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, and other developments. In_

II -21
the current quarter, however, given the low inflow of savings earlier
this year, a declining rate of housing starts would appear to be indi-
cated for August and especially September from the high July rate.
Consequently, although demand pressures are strong, the third quarter
average may run at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.4 million--
higher than originally projected, but still somewhat below the
upward-revised second quarter.
The labor market. The employment situation appears to have
continued firm in August. The level and rate of insured unemployment
continued below year-earlier levels thouugh mid-August. But youngsters--
generally not protected by unemployment insurance and, therefore, not
reflected in these figures--have carried the burden of easing demand
this summer. Some 1.8 million 16 to 21 year-olds were jobless this
June and July, about 150,000 more than year earlier. It is probable
that many of these youngsters withdrew from the labor force in August.
No August employment data are available yet, but easing
of growth in July is even more clearly evident in the revised July
figures. As revised, the preliminary employment increase of 63,000
in manufacturing in July is virtually eliminated, reflecting sizable
downward adjustments in electrical equipment, apparel, fabricated
metals, and food, along with smaller reductions in 10 other manufacturing
industries. (These data are confidential until released September
llth.) The only large employment increase remaining in manufacturing--
43,000 in transportation equipment--was mainly due to a later than

II -22
usual model changeover in the auto industry. Exclusive of transportation
equipment, manufacturing employment declined by nearly 40,000 in
July.
With demand still strong in August, employment is likely
to show a further gain; however, later in the year easier demand
for labor should weaken the employment picture. Increased tax
withholdings and rising prices are likely to dampen consumption,
particularly affecting industries such as television, recreation
goods, clothing, and, autos. At the same time, the heavy-goods industries
are entering a phase of comparatively slow growth. With capacity
utilization rates likely to dip, and construction activity likely to
remain fairly stable, demand for producers durables may rise only
modestly in the last half. In addition, the defense industries
are faced with a slow-down in purchases and the steel adjustment
will likely last through year end. All these factors point to widespread
but modest reductions in manufacturing employment.
In construction, unless there is an unexpected and substantial
pickup in building activity, employment, after falling by 200,000
between February and July, is likely to stabilize at about 3.2 million
for the remainder of the year. Service and trade employment is
likely to continue up, but at a slightly slower pace. Federal
government employment is expected to decline this fall and winter,
while State and local government employment is likely to expand at
a reduced pace.

II -23
With employment growth easing labor force increases are
likely to fall somewhat below projected long-term "normal" growth
of about 1.5 million a year. But the labor force is likely to rise
by more than employment, and the total unemployment rate will move
irregularly higher over the fall and winter months, and may average
about 4.0 per cent for the fourth quarter,
Wage changes. Collective bargaining settlements in the
first half of this year provided substantially higher first-year
wage increases--7.5 per cent--than in contracts negotiated in 1967
or 1966. But wage rate increases provided for later years of the
contract were substantially lower--about 4 per cent--so that the annual
rate of increase when averaged over the life of the contract was little
changed from the average for 1967. The spread of "front-loading" to
settlements in nonmanufacturing industries this year has been an
important factor in the upward pressure on wage rates. As these
contracts mature, the smaller wage rate increases of second subsequent
years will tend to moderate labor coat pressures somewhat.

Wholesale prices. Average prices of industrial commodities
are estimated by the BLS to be unchanged in August, while prices of
agricultural commodities have declined following a one month rise in
July. The preliminary total wholesale price index declined 0.4 per
cent to its June level of 108.7 per cent of the 1957-59 average.
It was expected that the general price increases first
announced by the steel industry in early August would exert upward
pressures on August figures, but the effective dates were later than
the BLS pricing date of August 13th. Subsequently, additional selective
price increases were announced and the average rise for all steel mill
products is estimated to be about 2-1/2 per cent. This will be
reflected in the September WPI and is likely to amount to an increase
of about 0.1 per cent in the total index.
Most of the 0.4 per cent increase in the WPI for July was
attributable to a temporary upturn in farm and food products, while
grain prices continued to decline in July and August. Wheat prices
have dropped 10 per cent since June and are 20 per cent below last
season. Prices of other grains and soybeans have also declined in line
with a worldwide easing in supplies of major farm commodities. Reduced
domestic supplies of cotton, fruits, and vegetables last season had led
to higher prices during the first half of this year, but larger crops
of these products are being realized this season.
Prices of industrial commodities in July increased by only
0.1 per cent as higher prices for lumber, textiles, leather, and rubber
products were nearly offset by declines in fuels, chemicals, and metals--

II -26
especially nonferrous metals. The largest price rise was in lumber
and wood products partly reflecting increased demands by lumber dealers
to rebuild inventories and a higher rate of housing construction.
Excess capacity for liquified petroleum gas and an improvement in
copper supplies resulted in lower prices. Among final products there
was a slight decline in wholesale prices of new cars resulting from
intensified dealer incentive programs. On the other hand, prices of
furniture, appliances, and automobile tires registered increases.
The further easing in upward pressure on industrial commodity
prices shown in the BLS preliminary data for July has been confirmed by
the release of the revised data shown below. The reduction in the
number of price increases since the past winter and spring, as well as
the large jump in the number of decreases in July, is impressive.

Consumer prices. The consumer price index rose 0.5 per cent
in July for the second consecutive month--the sharpest two-month increase
since June-July 1957. More than one-half of the July increase was due
to the increase of 0.7 per cent in consumer services, primarily mortgage
interest and medical care charges.

II -27
Mortgage interest charges increased by 4-1/2 per cent (they
increased nearly 4 per cent in June) and were 13-1/2 per cent above a
year earlier. Property taxes and insurance rose 0.8 per cent, and
domestic services were up 0.5 per cent. Over-all homeowner costs rose
1.3 per cent in July. Medical care services increased 0.7 per cent as
their steep climb was resumed following a moderate rise in June. Higher
physician and dentist fees were mainly responsible for the increase, but
hospital service charges also rose substantially.
Grocery-store prices advanced 0.8 per cent, a smaller increase
than expected seasonally, and restaurant meals and between-meal snacks
increased 0.6 per cent further. The rise in food prices at wholesale
in July was followed by a decline in August which may limit the increase
in retail food prices in August. Apparel prices declined less than
expected seasonally in July, and footwear rose contraseasonally owing
to increased demands and higher costs. Over-all, prices of commodities
other than foods advanced 0.2 per cent instead of registering the
alight decline that is usual for July.
Agricultural conditions. Based on August 1 conditions, crop
production this year will top the record output of 1967 by 3 per cent
and exceed the 1957-59 average by 21 per cent. Prior to the August 1
crop report, it had been assumed that crop output would about equal
1967.

Abroad, as well as at home, surplus production of farm
commodities is in prospect in contrast to the critical shortages of two
years ago. Even in India transportation and storage of the huge crops
are a problem. Pressure on prices and on the price stabilization pro-
grams of the free world are great. The U.S. net expenditure for
stabilization of farm prices, now estimated at $3.5 billion for 1968-69
compares with an estimated net expenditure in the EEC countries of $2.7
billion in 1968-69.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL SITUATION
Bank credit. Total loans and investments at all commercial
banks are estimated to have increased at approximately a 14 per cent
annual rate in August, about half the exceptionally rapid July rate of
growth. In July, a $4 billion Treasury cash financing in the latter
part of the month contributed substantially to the increase in bank
credit. In August, too, Treasury financings added to bank credit
growth as the Treasury raised nearly $2 billion of new cash and
refunded a sizable amount of maturing coupon issues. In addition to
the effects of Treasury financing, bank credit expansion in August was
augmented by large bank acquisitions of municipal and agency issues as
well as further growth in virtually all major loan categories.

Business loans, as measured by the end-of-month series, are
estimated to have increased $900 million in August, or at about the
pace of the previous two months. Weekly reporting bank data on busi-
ness loans by industry, however, do not indicate any broad strength in
loan demand. With the exception of some mild expansion in textiles,
construction, and public utilities, bank loans to most industrial
categories displayed about normal or somewhat less than normal growth
over the first three weeks of the month. While a few banks indicated
somewhat greater leniency in lending to established and local customers,
the August Lending Practices Survey gave no indication that easier
lending policies were a significant factor affecting the recent volume
of business loan expansion. (See Appendix A.)
In spite of recent uncertainty as to the course of interest
rates in the near future and the continued high cost of dealer financ-
ing, security loans in August showed a moderate further increase--
following the July surge--as dealers apparently are maintaining their
high level of speculative inventories in hopes that interest rates will
decline. Consumer loans also continued to expand at the increased pace
of recent months, associated in large part with financing of the high
volume of automobile sales. Growth in real estate loans remained
moderate, and may reflect hesitancy on the part of some banks to expand
commitments to acquire mortgages while inflows of consumer-type time
and savings deposits continue at the moderate pace of recent months.
With the availability of funds improved, banks acquired
approximately $2.0 billion of securities in August in order to take

III -3
advantage of the relatively high yields still available. Since midyear--
when the marked improvement in deposit inflows began--banks have taken
nearly $5.0 billion of securities into portfolio. About 60 per cent of
the July-August increase in bank security holdings represents Govern-
ments, most of which were acquired in the recent Treasury financings.
(Net bank acquisitions of the new 6-year notes offered in the midmonth
refunding accounting for most of the $900 million increase in Government
security holdings in August.)
Moreover, banks also added approximately $1.1 billion of
other securities to their portfolios in August bringing net acquisi-
tions since midyear to almost $2.0 billion. While much of the August
increase in these holdings was in short-term municipals, banks--as in
July--acquired a significant amount of the relatively high yielding
longer-term issues.
Bank deposits. Following an increase of almost $2.5 billion
in July, time and savings deposits at all commercial banks in August
are estimated to have increased by another $3.3 billion, on a daily
average basis, or at about a 20.8 per cent annual rate. As in July, a
large part of this rapid expansion was attributable to CD sales by
banks, since August inflows of consumer-type time and savings deposits
appear to have remained at the moderate pace of recent months. Time
deposits held by state and local governments also rose more than usual,
probably reflecting in part the temporary investment of funds obtained
in recent capital market financings.

Despite the recent back up in some market rates of interest,
CD's still remain competitive with most other money market instruments,
and large banks added another $800 million to their outstandings during
the first three weeks in August--bringing this total to a new high of
$22.3 billion. The increase in outstanding CD's occurred almost
exclusively at banks outside of New York and Chicago, where loan demand
for the most part has remained somewhat stronger. Banks in New York
and Chicago have ready access to the Euro-dollar market and as the cost
of these funds fell slightly below that of CD's during August, they
relied more heavily on the Euro-dollar than on the CD market as a source
of funds. (Over the four weeks ending August 28, banks in New York and
Chicago account for all of the $900 million increase in head office
liabilities to their foreign branches.) However, interest in CD's by
outside banks also appears to be waning, as indicated by the successively
smaller weekly increases in CD's outstanding at these banks during August.

III -5
With most market rates of interest unchanged to somewhat
higher than early in the month, inflows of consumer-type time and
savings deposits at large banks during the first three weeks in August
remained at about the moderate pace prevailing since the end of April.
Although the average weekly change in these deposits during August rose
somewhat over that of recent months, much of this increase occurred at
banks in New York during the week of the Treasury financing. Savings
deposits at large banks, after declining in July, showed only nominal
growth compared to most recent past years. Inflows of savings deposits
at country banks, although much greater than those at large banks, also
were below the comparable period of last year. Time certificates and
open accounts at large banks, however, continued to expand fairly
rapidly, matching the expansion in 1967.
Following the rapid July increase, the money stock, on a
daily average basis, is estimated to have expanded at a much reduced
3.8 per cent annual rate in August. This slower rate of expansion may
reflect some movement of private demand balances into U.S. Government
deposits in response to the recent Treasury financing, although the
reduced level of stock market activity in August probably also con-
tributed to a lower transactions need for cash.
Nonbank depositary intermediaries. During the first half of
August, savings appeared to be flowing into mutual savings banks at a
more rapid rate than in July, as judged by data from the fifteen largest
savings banks in New York City, the only institutions for which August

III -6
1/
data are available.- Moreover, although the increase in their passbook
loans was sizable, it was considerably below that for May, the corres-
ponding month in the reinvestment cycle.

During July, mutual savings banks' liquidity ratios-/
continued to drift downward, while the net increase in mortgage hold-
ings exceeded for the third consecutive month the continued large net
acquisition of corporate securities. The savings and loan average
liquidity ratio also dropped in July--from 10.0 per cent in June to
9.6 per cent, the lowest since November 1966. This reflected the FHLBB

regulatory change permitting a one-half percentage point decrease--
to 6.5 per cent--in the required liquidity ratio to help stimulate
mortgage lending. While the net increase in S&L mortgage holdings was
not particularly large, it was presumably aided by the decrease in
required liquidity.
Mortgage market developments. The residential mortgage
market eased slightly further during August, judging from fragmentary
reports received thus far. Weekly applications to FHA for insurance
of existing-home mortgages, which usually fluctuate rather sensitively
with general market conditions, tended higher through the week ended
August 22, the latest available date. After changing little through
mid-August, implicit yields in the FNMA weekly forward commitment
auction of Government underwritten home loans available for future
delivery to FNMA edged down in each of the three weeks following the
initial reduction in the Federal Reserve discount rate effective
August 16.

During July as a whole, yields on certain FHA-insured
mortgages traded in the private secondary market reversed their earlier
uptrend and declined by as much as 10 basis points, according to the
FHA series, affirming earlier indications of easing in this sensitive
sector of the mortgage market. The decline was the first in 5 months,
and the largest in more than a year and a half. Average discounts
required by lenders on these loans dropped to 5-1/2 points--still large
enough to inhibit some transactions financed with this type of credit
but nevertheless the lowest in nearly a year.
In the more sluggish primary mortgage market, interest rates
on conventional new-home loans increased less during July than in any
of the 3 preceding months, based on the FHA series shown in the table.
The Northeastern area again recorded the largest rise, reflecting
further increases in usury ceilings in New Jersey and New York, both
effective July 1, following an increase in Pennsylvania around mid-May.
During July, returns on Government underwritten as well as
conventional mortgages again widened somewhat over yields on new issues
of high-grade corporate bonds. The gross yield margin favoring these
mortgages, while the most attractive in more than a year, continued
considerably below spreads generally prevailing prior to 1965, even if
some allowance is made for interim reductions in mortgage servicing
costs.

Confidential field reports from both FHA and VA indicated
some improvement in the availability of mortgage funds by the end of
July, particularly on long-term loans, as lenders apparently accelerated
their new commitment approvals in order to lock up the high yields
prevailing at the time. In view of this development, total outstanding

residential mortgage commitments of reporting thrift institutions rose
in July for the first time in three months, according to the seasonally
adjusted data shown in the table. At thrift institutions the backlog
of mortgage commitments to be taken down in coming months remained
quite high relative to their recent cash flow positions, undoubtedly
also reflecting expectations of further improvement ahead in inflows.

The quality of outstanding mortgage debt generally improved
again during the second quarter, judging from such after-the-fact
measures as delinquency rates and foreclosure rates relating to loans
closed mainly in earlier periods. Some improvement could have been
expected in view of demand pressures for available housing, further
increases in used-house prices, and the comparatively limited number
of unseasoned risk-prone loans outstanding relative to the growing
number of total mortgages in force. While the composite delinquency
rate on home mortgages (MBA series) rose in the second quarter, the
increase reflected a slight rise only in short-term delinquencies from
a reduced level, as 60-day-and-over delinquencies showed further year-
over-year improvement to the lowest rate in 8 years. The over-all
foreclosure rate on nonfarm mortgages (FHLBB series) again declined,
and reached the lowest level since 1961.
Corporate and municipal bond markets. Yields on corporate
bonds on balance showed little change over the latter half of August,
while municipal bond yields advanced significantly, returning to early
July levels. In both markets, investor response accorded new issues
notably lacked enthusiasm and the volume of unsold bonds in syndicate
consequently rose. After the sharp yield decline in July, investors
appeared to have second thoughts about their expectations as to the
course or rapidity of monetary ease. But the recent cut in the discount
rate seemed to be viewed by investors as some confirmation of their
earlier expectations that monetary restraint was in the process of being
relaxed. While this action did not drive yields down, it limited the
extent of developing upward yield pressures.

The divergent path of corporate and municipal bond yields
appears to be primarily a reflection of the substantially different
volume of current and prospective new issues in these two markets.
Public flotations of corporate bonds in August are estimated to have
aggregated $675 million, about 45 per cent below July--a much larger
than seasonal drop-off. This volume was below earlier expectations as
several convertible bond offerings were pushed forward to the September
calendar. Total corporate security offerings, including private place-
ments and stock issues, are estimated at about $1.6 billion, which is
also well below earlier months this year and the outsized August 1967
volume.

Moderation of corporate bond offerings is likely to continue
in September, as the calendar now totals about $550 million and the
ultimate volume may be no more than $750 million. While there are no
sizable industrial issues currently scheduled, some such offerings may
be placed on the market by corporations which deferred financing
earlier in the hope of catching lower rates. But the total volume of
corporate security offerings, nonetheless, will likely show at most a
seasonal rise in September.
In contrast to the corporate market, the estimated volume of
new municipal issues in August--at $1.7 billion--was a record for any
month. This sharply enlarged volume included more than $200 million
industrial aid bonds and a $286 million utility revenue issue--the
largest single municipal offering in more than four years. Even though
offering yields advanced throughout much of the month, a sizable volumeB(

of these issues was not fully absorbed. As a consequence, the market
is in a poor technical position with about $800 million of dealers'
advertised inventories, a high for the year. Moreover, this overhang
of unsold bonds is coincident with no respite from the unusually large
volume of new offerings. The September volume is estimated at $1.5
billion--a record for the month--with more than $300 million industrial
revunue bonds included.

Stock market. During August, common stock prices fluctuated
within a narrow range somewhat below their all-time highs reached in
mid-July. Trading volume remained moderate throughout the month.
Apparently stemming the earlier decline and contributing to the market
stability throughout August were somewhat improved investor expectations
regarding monetary policy, profit prospects, and the economic outlook
in general.

Preliminary figures now available for July show that margin
debt of brokers' customers dropped $240 million or 3.6 per cent to
$6,450 million during the month. Over the same period the New York
Stock Exchange composite price index fell 2.3 per cent. The decline
in margin debt was the first since January 1968 and the largest in the
two-and-one-half-year history of the series. In addition, the number
of margin accounts declined by 5,000, the first decline since 1966.
At banks, purpose loans to non-brokers continued to rise moderately--
by $14 million--possibly because of borrowing to buy corporate or
1/municipal bonds;- indeed, during the first half of August such debt
rose by an additional $50 million to $2,473 million.

U. S. Government securities market. The market for Treasury
securities has shown no clear trend since the last meeting of the
Committee, with prices in both the bond and bill sectors fluctuating
moderately in response to a number of diverse influences. The cut in
the discount rate by the Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank and the
accompanying reduction in the repurchase agreement rate to 5-1/4 per
cent on August 15 had a favorable, but very short-lived effect on yields,
Thus, after yield declines of around 6 basis points on Treasury bills
and of from 2 to 4 points on intermediate and long-term issues in trad-
ing immediately after the initial discount rate cut, market yields
quickly rebounded and within a week were at or above the levels immed-
iately preceding the discount rate action.

Remarks by the President on the bombing of North Vietnam and
the tensions caused by the Czech crisis had an adverse impact on the
market because of their possible implications for Government spending.
Moreover, there was apparently some adjustment in positions by dealers
who had anticipated a larger discount rate reduction.
Most recently, prices of coupon issues have moved higher as
market participants have interpreted recent System actions and reserve
data as at least confirming that policy had taken an easier stance.
In addition there has been a moderate net retail demand for Governments.
The market also was buoyed by the anticipation that the Desk probably
would buy coupon issues in preparation for the Labor Day weekend. On
Thursday before the holiday the System did buy over $80 million of
notes and bonds.
A hesitant tone has pervaded the market for Treasury bills
in most sessions. Bill yields now stand about 10 basis points above
the level reached about the time of the last Committee meeting.
The dealers' large bill positions, as well as relatively
substantial coupon holdings, together with the higher cost of day-to-
day financing, have in part been responsible for this back-up of rates
as some dealers sought to reduce their positions from the record levels
reached at midmonth. The reduction in the discount rate by 1/4 of a
point, rather than the 1/2 many had expected, encouraged this movement.
The occurrence of three regular auctions in the week of August 26
frustrated this action to some extent; and on September 3, dealer posi-
tions in bills stood at $3.7 billion, despite the fact that sizable
sales to foreign accounts had eased some of the pressure on holdings.

As the accompanying table shows, dealer positions and
borrowings rose markedly in July; borrowings continued upward in August
and totaled $6 billion on August 15, the payment date for the Treasury
financing. The increased demand for financing fell most heavily on
banks. Of the $3 billion rise in borrowings from the beginning of July
to mid-August, about two-thirds was accommodated at banks. This grow-
ing demand contributed to the relatively high dealer loan rates and
large basic reserve deficits of the major banks throughout July and
August.
Since August 15 dealer positions have risen by about $370
million. Daily financing needs have continued to be frequently near
$1.5 million, but borrowings have been reduced $250 billion. Almost

III -19
all of the reduction has been at banks, with nonbank lenders--mainly
corporations, who appear to be in relatively liquid position--now
providing a somewhat higher proportion of these funds than at midmonth.
Rate movements on other short-term instruments in recent
weeks have also fluctuated and, if anything, have been even less clear-
cut as to a general trend than have short maturity Government yields.
On balance, however, these yields--like those on Treasury bills--are
generally higher than at midmonth, although in many instances the change
has been negligible.

Federal finance. The Treasury's cash operating balance at
the end of August totaled $4.6 billion, or $500 million less than pro-
jected in the last Greenbook, with the shortfall spread rather widely
through a number of receipt and expenditure items. According to
present projections, the balance will decline to a rather low level
at mid-September, possibly requiring temporary overdrafts with the
Federal Reserve, but thereafter as quarterly tax payments are deposited,
it will rise substantially.
Looking beyond September to the fourth quarter, the Treasury
will experience large, partly seasonal, cash drains, as shown in the
table. Accordingly, a $3.0 billion borrowing operation is assumed for
the second half of October. In view of the large Treasury cash surplus
projected for next spring, and in line with previous Treasury statements,
the October financing is likely to consist of tax bills.
While trends in Federal spending for fiscal 1969 to date are
difficult to interpret from the data now available, thus far they seem
to be consistent with the assumptions underlying Greenbook projections.
The Administration's problem of deciding which specific programs to cut
is still complicated by the fact that Congress has not yet completed
action on several major appropriation bills. Moreover, spending in two
uncontrollable programs that fall within the area of the budget subject
to the over-all expenditure ceiling is now expected to be about $1 billion
larger than previously projected, necessitating a commensurately larger
cut-back in other programs also subject to the ceiling. About $700
million of the expected overage is attributable to CCC crop purchases,
and the other $300 million to Medicaid and other public assistance grants
to states.

Exchange market developments. Until the last week of August -
when rumors of a revaluation of the German mark thoroughly destabilized
the exchange markets -- the pattern of developments for most foreign
currencies had not been significantly different from that of July. In
the first three weeks of August the French franc continued to be under
selling pressure, although less severe than in July. The German mark
(until August 27) continued to trade well below par as very easy money
market conditions in Germany continued to encourage both short- and long-
term capital outflows; the Canadian dollar remained quite firm with the
Bank of Canada making sizeable purchases of dollars; the Italian lira
continued to show seasonal strength; the other major currencies showed
little tendency for significant pressures to develop in either direction.
The most notable exception to this approximate repetition of
the July pattern of events was in the market for sterling. The pound
had recovered quite well in July and the Bank of England purchased over
$500 million in the market. Early in August sterling remained firm but
its first setback of the month came on August 13 with the release of
the British trade figures for July, which showed a deficit paralleling

IV -2
those of April and May. A little more than one week later (on August 21)
sterling experienced another setback as the Czech-Soviet confrontation
emerged. Up to this point sterling had been quoted markedly lower than
in the first two weeks of August but selling pressure was moderate and
the Bank of England had provided only modest support for the rate.
The mark revaluation rumors which began on August 27 sharply
accelerated pressures on both sterling and the French franc. During
this final hectic week of the month the Bank of England and Bank of
France each sold approximately $150 million in support of their re-
spective currencies while the Bundesbank made spot market purchases
in excess of $850 million. Furthermore, the Bundesbank intervened in
the forward market, swapping $240 million (selling dollars spot against
two and three-month forward repurchase); and the Federal Reserve Bank
of New York sold $32 million equivalent of marks on an outright forward
basis, half for System account and half for Treasury account.
The French franc began and ended the month at its floor;
sterling's overall decline was from about 239.40, in the first two
days of August, to its August 30 afternoon quotation of 238.38; during
the last week of August the German mark moved nearly the full range
between its lower and upper support levels.
The failure of the mark revaluation to materialize on the
last weekend of August has not generated a major reflow of funds away
from marks. The speculative atmosphere seemed to have subsided somewhat
as of last Monday and Tuesday (September 2 and 3), but on Wednesday a

IV -3
new wave of speculation hit the market -- possibly in response to
Bundesbank President Blessing's statement late Tuesday that "some day"
the mark might have to be revalued if Germany's trading partners con-
tinued to tolerate creeping inflation.
Between August 26 and September 4 the Bundesbank made gross
spot market purchases of dollars totaling about $1 billion, while
engaging in "swap" operations with German commercial banks totaling
about $700 million. The resulting net increment to German reserves
of about $300 million was roughly equal to the volume of intervention
losses by other major central banks (principally the Bank of France
and Bank of England).
Gold markets have been generally quiet in the past several
weeks. During the month of August prices advanced from a level just
under $39.00 to a level just under $40.00. Prices declined modestly
early in the month but began to rise concurrent with the release of
the British trade figures on August 13; they were marked up rather
sharply (but temporarily) at the time of the Czech crisis, and ad-
vanced further during the week of German mark speculation.
Euro-dollar market. U.S. banks drew rather heavily on the
Euro-dollar market for funds during the month of August. Between
July 31 and August 28 liabilities to foreign branches increased $875
million to a new peak of $7,085 million. U.S. banks had reduced
their use of Euro-dollar funds during the last three weeks of July
by about $750 million; thus, the $7,085 million peak level of

IV -4
outstanding liabilities on August 28 was only about $120 million more
than the previous peak level of July 10.
The decrease in U.S. bank liabilities to overseas branches
after July 10 is not readily explainable, especially in view of the
fact that the cost of Euro-dollar funds to the banks was, generally
speaking, lower than the cost of funds acquired in domestic financial
markets during this period. Dollar advances to banks' head offices
had, however, risen very sharply during the second quarter, and growing
evidence of easier monetary conditions in the United States coupled
with the fact that some banks may have felt overly dependent on Euro-
dollar funds may have caused U.S. banks to reduce their liabilities
to overseas branches. The volume of outstanding C/D's of New York
banks increased by about $350 million between July 10 and July 31,
coinciding with the reduction in Euro-dollar liabilities through
overseas branches and indicating that U.S. banks again were able to
compete more successfully for funds in domestic markets.
Even though supply conditions in the Euro-dollar market
were less favorable than in June and early July, when there were
massive flows of speculative funds from the French franc and sterling,
Euro-dollar rates fell considerably in the last three weeks of July,
probably reflecting the reduced demand for funds from U.S. banks. The
rate for three-month funds felt from 6.69 per cent per annum on July 10
to 6.25 per cent by the end of July.

IV -5
During August Euro-dollar rates have held relatively steady;
the three-month deposit rate has ranged between 5.94 and 6.12 per cent
per annum even in face of the relatively heavy demand for funds from
U.S. banks. The supply of funds apparently came mainly from holders
of sterling, French franc and (until the final week of August) German
mark assets. There are two possible factors behind the recent increase
in demand for Euro-dollar funds from U.S. banks. First, the cost of
Euro-dollar funds -- particularly 3-month deposits -- has been lower
than the cost of domestic U.S. funds. Second, it may be that U.S.
banks, anticipating a further decline in domestic U.S. interest rates
and hence being hesitant to issue long-term domestic C/D's, are ac-
quiring very short-term deposits in the Euro-dollar market in lieu of
longer-term domestic funds.
U.S. balance of payments. The third quarter opened with an
unusually low liquidity deficit in July -- about $100 million before
special transactions or seasonal adjustment. This relatively favor-
able outcome resulted in part from a net reduction of over $180 million
in claims on foreigners reported by banks, and continued heavy purchases
of U.S. corporate stocks by foreigners. According to the weekly figures
for August, however, the liquidity balance has once more swung into
heavy deficit. In the four weeks ended August 28 it amounted to $561
million, and about $775 million before special transactions. The
special transactions in August included the latest $125 million in-
stallment under the German military offset agreement, and a conversion

IV -6
of $100 million of official Argentine balances from liquid to non-liquid
form. August, and the third quarter as a whole, are seasonally adverse
because of tourism and other factors, but the average August deficit
before special transactions has been about $400 million in the past few
years. These early and partial figures for August suggest that the im-
provement in the overall balance registered in the May-July period has
suffered at least a temporary setback.
The balance on the official settlements basis showed a deficit
of $73 million in July but turned to a surplus of about $140 million in
August through the 28th. The striking difference in the behavior of the
two measures of the balance between July and August reflected primarily
the fact that in July non-official foreign liquid dollar holdings rose
by only about $50 million, whereas in the four weeks of August such
accounts increased by some $900 million. Most of the activity in these
accounts is reflected in liabilities to foreign branches of U.S. banks,
which are discussed above.
Direct foreign investments. Much of the hope for improvement
in the balance of payments this year was based on the new mandatory con-
trols, which were to reduce direct investment (including reinvested
earnings) by $1 billion from the 1967 amount. Many changes have already
been made in the regulations governing the program, and some unexpected
developments have occurred, including (a) a very large demand for special
authorizations covering prior commitments or abnormal circumstances in
the base period, and (b) a massive and successful effort by direct

IV -7
investors to tap European capital markets. As far as can be judged by
the not altogether satisfactory information gathered from OFDI (Office
of Foreign Direct Investments) operations and projections at this time,
a saving of $1 billion compared to 1967 is still possible, but it will
depend in large part on companies that do not use their basic quotas
in 1968 but carry them into 1969. This will occur either because
investors -- especially those with large bases in less developed
countries -- will not wish to invest as much as they could this year,
or because of the requirement now in the regulations that companies
with funds available out of foreign borrowings must use those funds
prior to using their generally allowable investment quotas in the
various scheduled areas. But if there is a large carry forward, it
will, of course, complicate the operation of any 1969 program.
It is difficult to judge from the direct investment capital
outflow figures given in the balance of payments accounts how much
effect the restraint program had in the first half of the year, and
whether a different result can be expected in the second.

As indicated in the table, direct investment outflows rose
in the second quarter (and show a considerably larger increase on a
seasonally adjusted basis), though most of the upturn was in flows to
Canada, which are exempt from the restrictions. However, these figures
include amounts derived from foreign borrowing, which should be sub-
tracted to arrive at the outflow of U.S. funds subject to the OFDI
restrictions. For all of 1967 the Office of Business Economics tables
show $278 million of foreign financing entering these outflows, reducing
the net flow to about $2-3/4 billion. In the first half of 1968 the OBE
tally shows that only about $150 million of foreign funds was included
in the total. These figures on the use of foreign funds are probably
low, since they exclude certain types of borrowing, but they are con-
sistent for the two periods. On this basis, the net outflow of U.S.
funds for direct investment in the first half of 1968 (excluding Canada
but including some other outflows not covered by the OFDI program) was
about the same as in the first half of 1967.
Data from OFDI reports for the second quarter will not be
tabulated for several weeks, and important differences will perhaps
appear because the regulations do not extend to all the outflows
included in the balance of payments accounts. At the moment, however,
the OBE estimates indicate that the drawdowns against proceeds of
foreign financing will have to accelerate in the second half if
investors are to stay within the program allowables. This would
imply somewhat less pressure on the balance of payments in the

IV -9
second half, since the balance of payments gain does not show up when
these funds are borrowed and held abroad in liquid form, but occurs
instead when these funds are drawn down and substituted for outflows
of U.S. funds.
Income received from direct foreign investments was at an
annual rate of $4.6 billion in the first half of the year, slightly
above the $4.5 rate for all of last year. However, such returns had
reached a $5 billion rate in the last half of 1967. The effect of
OFDI limits on reinvested earnings in Schedule C (developed) countries,
plus some improvement in earnings experience abroad, should be to raise
income receipts in the second half to at least the level achieved at
the end of last year.
The latest projections of expenditures for plant and equipment
by foreign affiliates of U.S. firms indicate continued cooling off from
the 20 per cent increases of 1964 and 1965 and the 16 per cent increase
of 1966. In 1967 such expenditures increased by a relatively moderate
7 per cent, and for 1968 the increase is expected to drop to 5 per cent.
For 1969 these early indicators suggest no more than another modest
rise in capital expenditures abroad. The results of the new survey
are summarized in the accompanying table. Year-to-year changes are
measured by the OBE by comparing estimates made at the same period of
each year. However, the control programs may be affecting the timing
of company planning, and if the comparison is made based on the last
two columns of the table -- which give the projections for both 1968

IV -10
and 1969 as made by the companies in June this year -- some decline is
suggested. In any case, expenditures in 1968 and in 1969 will be main-
tained at far higher levels than a few years ago, but will be financed
to a much lesser extent by outflows from the United States.

Other capital accounts. As mentioned earlier, bank-reported
claims on foreigners were reduced by about $180 million in July, of which
about $130 million was in banking claims covered by the restraint program.
The inflow came mainly from Europe ($140 million) and Japan ($68 million),
and was partly offset by outflows to Canada. In the seven months through
July the net capital inflow from bank-reported claims totalled $800 mil-
lion, accounted for mainly by a reduction of nearly $400 million in
Europe and $200 million in Japan.

IV -11
An additional effect of the controls on direct investments
has been to force some liquidation of liquid balances abroad, apart
from those consisting of the temporarily invested proceeds of foreign
borrowing. The exact amount involved is uncertain because of the
intermingling of these two kinds of liquid foreign assets, but as a
rough order of magnitude the liquidation in the first half might have
amounted to $200 million. By June 30 the reduction of balances re-
quired by OFDI regulations should have been accomplished.
Purchases of U.S. securities by foreigners continued on
a substantial scale in July. Foreigners bought, net, about $160
million of U.S. corporate stocks, in line with the monthly average
of the first half of the year, and also purchased approximately $150
million of convertible bonds issued by Delaware affiliates for use
in financing direct foreign investments.
U.S. foreign trade. In July the merchandise trade balance
(balance of payments basis) returned to an export surplus, following
two successive monthly deficits, as exports increased slightly and
imports fell sharply. But for the three months of May-July combined,
the trade balance was in deficit by about $400 million, at an annual
rate, compared with a surplus at a rate of nearly $900 million in
January-April.
Comparing the first four months of the year to the May-July
period, exports rose at an annual rate of about 7 per cent; average
shipments in the latter period exceeded those in the early months by

IV -12
a little less than 2 per cent. A gain of over 4 per cent in non-
agricultural exports was largely offset by a steep decline in
shipments of agricultural products, mainly P.L. 480 deliveries of
wheat to India and Pakistan. The general abundance of crops in both
foreign exporting and importing countries makes it uncertain whether
exports of agricultural commodities in fiscal 1969 will be as large
as they were in the last fiscal year.
The gains in shipments of nonagricultural products in May-
July appear to be somewhat more widespread than they were earlier in
the year. Exports of aircraft remained high, and sales of cars to
Canada expanded further, while shipments of refined copper continued
to rise following the resumption of operations by domestic copper
refineries after the copper strike ended in March. In addition,
exports of machinery, chemicals and logs and lumber also advanced
in the more recent period.
By area, the greatest gain in exports in May-July over
those in January-April was in shipments to the EEC countries. These
increased by nearly 13 per cent over the rate in the first four months
of the year, with much of the advance in commodities other than copper
and aircraft. Exports to the U.K. and Latin America also expanded
sharply. The more moderate rise in shipments to Japan consisted
largely of greater deliveries of commercial aircraft. Despite the
advance in deliveries of cars to Canada, total exports to that country
fell substantially during May-July.

IV -13
Imports in July declined by over 6 per cent from the record
rate of the preceding month. The drop, however, was concentrated in
a few commodities -- nonferrous metals, mainly copper, and cars from
Canada, and does not appear to signal any general weakening in imports
from the very high rates of the first six months of the year.
The decline in arrivals of cars from Canada was exceptionally
large, apparently greater than seasonal. It is not expected that this
low rate will be sustained. Continued growth in such imports seems
probable after the changeover to the 1969 models is completed. Imports
of cars from Europe and Japan continued to gain in July as the inventory
buildup in these cars accelerated.
Copper imports in July were only about two-thirds of the pre-
strike rate, as both refined and unrefined types fell sharply. Arrivals
of refined copper in July were at the prestrike level, but imports of
unrefined copper were considerably below a "normal" rate. Exceptionally
heavy withdrawals of copper from customs warehouses in June to avoid
payment of import duties which were reimposed on July 1, following
their suspension since early 1966, may have temporarily reduced new
import requirements. After working off of these inventories there
may be an upturn in copper imports later in the year, unless of course,
domestic demand declines. For the next month or two, however, pro-
duction difficulties in Chile resulting from a drought and the
consequent reduction in waterpower may limit imports from that country.

IV -14
The Treasury Department has announced the imposition of
countervailing duties on all shipments of dutiable imports from
France, beginning September 14. The action is a result of an
investigation conducted after issuance by the French Government
of a decree providing for certain subsidy payments on French
exports. The amount of the countervailing duty will be equal to
2.5 per cent of the f.o.b. price of the imported merchandise from
September 15 through the end of October, and half that rate from
November until January 31 when the French subsidies are scheduled
to be removed. Since the countervailing duties at the full rate
of 2.5 per cent are to be imposed only for slightly more than one
month, little permanent effect on our imports from France is
expected, although there may be some postponements.

IV -15
Financial markets in major industrial countries. In general,
financial markets have eased somewhat in most industrial countries
during recent weeks, although, except in Canada and in the Euro-dollar
market, the softening in interest rates from peaks reached earlier
this year has not gone as far as it has in the United States. In
most countries, interest rates are currently below their recent highs,
with declines in long-term yields noticeably less pronounced than in
those on short-term instruments. It is not yet clear to what extent, if
any, this trend toward ease will be impeded by the current speculative
movement into German marks.
The sharpest declines in interest rates have occurred in
the Euro-dollar and Canadian markets, with the 3-month Euro-dollar
rate dropping from 7-1/8 in late May to 6-1/3 per cent by the end
of August; the Canadian 91-day Treasury bill rate fell by 1.45 per-
centage points during the same period. Because of the close link
between these markets and the U.S. financial market, such changes
can be attributed in large part to the significant drop in U.S. rates
during roughly the same period. Relaxation of pressures in other
foreign financial markets also can apparently be characterized in
part as a reaction to changed financial conditions in the United States,
and in some cases to a desire to back away from abnormally high rates
established earlier. Improved balances of payments in a number of
countries have contributed directly to the easing of monetary con-
ditions by adding to bank reserves, and in Canada and Japan discrete
policy actions have signaled the trend towards ease.

VI -18
In the United Kingdom short-term rates have declined
significantly while long-term rates, although slightly below their
mid-July highs, remain above the end-of-May levels. The sharp de-
cline in Euro-dollar rates from their peaks at the end of May has
been a major factor permitting the decrease of U.K. short-term
yields. The markedly lower discount on forward sterling probably
both reflected and aided the strengthening trend in British financial
markets. The expectation throughout July that the discount rate
would be reduced also contributed to the decline in the Treasury
bill rate. It was widely assumed that the authorities would react
to the strengthening of sterling in early July by lowering Bank Rate,
and the market had discounted the anticipated reduction. However,
the setback dealt to sterling by the poor July trade figures and the
impact of the East European crisis make a cut in Bank Rate in the
coming weeks unlikely.
British long-term interest rates rose very sharply from
May until early July in connection with increased concern over the
future of the $2.40 parity. In the early part of July, however, bond
prices advanced markedly, primarily in response to (a) assurances
that international assistance would be provided to deal with with-
drawals of officially held sterling balances and (b) the announcement
that Britain's trade deficit had substantially narrowed in June.
Bond prices weakened again in Mid-August on news that the July trade

VI -19
deficit had again widened. The Czech crisis the following week
reduced bond prices further. Gilt-edged yields, although above
end-of-May levels, currently remain below their early July highs.
When the pound was devalued in November, the Bank of England
instructed the banks to limit the total volume of lending to the
private sector to levels then outstanding. Loans to finance exports
were exempted, however, and, as a result, total lending continued
to rise. By late May private sector loans were 4 per cent above the
November level, indicating that "export" credits extended by the
banks during this period were exceedingly large. The Bank of England
was therefore prompted, on May 24, to impose a new ceiling directing
that lending to private borrowers not exceed the May level. Loans
for exports were included under the May ceiling, indicating that the
Bank was tightening monetary policy further.
Through August, private borrowing at banks stayed within
the prescribed limits, but there are indications that the demand
for bank credit is strengthening. Since the Bank has made clear
that breaches of the ceiling will not be allowed, lower interest
rates would be inopportune--an additional reason not to expect a
Bank Rate reduction in the near future.
Financial markets in Germany have remained liquid, although
interest rates have moved downward only slightly further. An indica-
tion of financial strength is the fact that the bond market has been
absorbing a growing volume of net new issues while bond yields have

VI -20
continued to decline, albeit only slightly. In July and August nearly
$485 million (equivalent) in DM issues were placed in Germany by
foreign borrowers, $200 million of which was placed by the IBRD. The
total was significantly larger than the $134 million sold in the first
six months of the year. The share of foreign issues offered in
Germany taken by German investors has also risen sharply this year--
from 38 per cent in the first half of 1967 to 83 per cent.
During the remainder of the year, domestic recourse to the
capital markets is expected to fall off from the advanced levels of
the first eight months. The central government is not expected to
float any more issues this year, and there are at present only two
local government offerings on the calendar. Public sector capital
expenditures, however, are expected to continue to rise during the
last half of the year, although at a slower rate than earlier.
By mid-August interest rates in France had declined from
their post-crisis peaks but remained above mid-May levels. The French
authorities reacted to the crisis by increasing the cost of credit.
At the same time they permitted an extremely rapid rise in the volume
of bank credit outstanding to accommodate the financial requirements of
those many firms, particularly smaller ones, left on the verge of
bankruptcy by strike losses and greatly increased wage bills. "Medium
and small firms" were cushioned from the cost effects of higher interest

VI -21
rates, and their access to bank credit was facilitated by the creation
of special borrowing facilities. Such enterprises, constituting 90
per cent of all French firms, may borrow from commerical banks their
increased working capital requirements made necessary by the unrest
for a period of up to 18 months at a fixed rate of 5 per cent. Loans
made under this regulation are rediscountable at the Bank of France
outside the discount ceilings and at 3-1/2 per cent, i.e., at the
discount rate prevailing before the July 2 increase. Also, in July
the medium-term paper reserve requirements for commercial banks were
reduced from 16 per cent of deposit liabilities to 14 per cent. It
is estimated that this had the effect of reducing total reserve re-
quirements (cash plus medium-term paper) from about 20 per cent to about
18. Basic rediscount ceilings for individual banks were also increased
by 20 per cent for a four-month period.
As a result of the above measures, Bank of France credit
increased from Fr. 23,763 million on May 8 to Fr. 34,980 million on
August 14, an increase of over 47 per cent. During the same period
in 1967, central bank credit increased by only 7 per cent.
The much higher budget deficit resulting from the Spring
unrest implies increased Treasury recourse to the money market. Dur-
ing the period from mid-May to August 8, the Treasury auctioned Fr. 3.7
billion of 12- and 10-month bills, compared with Fr. 2.0 billion a
year earlier, an increase of 85 per cent. The cost of Treasury borrow-
ing was up, though not as much as the discount rate; before the crisis,

VI -22
the yield on such bills averaged about 5.3 per cent. about 60 basis
points below recent rates. The French Treasury debt is becoming more
concentrated in short-term maturities and the Treasury will likely
continue to be an active participant in the short-term market. In
the long-term sector of the market, however, new bond issue activity
by the private sector has been at a virtual standstill.
In the Netherlands short-term rates increased from mid-May
to the end of July by over 1 percentage point. During August, rates
declined somewhat and are currently approaching end-May levels. Short-
term rates in Belgium have remained steady throughout the period. The
short-term rate in Switzerland increased by 50 basis points between
the end of April and early June and has not since declined. In May
and June bond yields in Italy continued their upward movement, while
longer-term rates in Belgium and the Netherlands fluctuated within a
relatively narrow range during the May-August period.
Effective August 29, the Danish discount rate was reduced
from 6-1/2 to 6 per cent--the third reduction this year--in re-
cognition of continued tendencies toward better overall balance in
the Danish economy.
Monetary conditions in Canada have eased significantly during
recent weeks. The Bank of Canada reduced the bank rate in two 1/2
percentage point steps during July, and effective September 3, the
discount rate has been reduced another 1/2 percentage point to
per cent. The Canadian Treasury bill yield is currently almost 1-1/2

VI -23
percentage points below the May peak, and long-term government bond
yields have declined by about 65 basis points over the same period.
Short-term rates are now at the levels which prevailed before Canada's
foreign exchange crisis began in January.
The shift from the extreme tightness of early 1968, when
interest rates reached record highs, has a number of explanations.
The principal factor was the end of Canada's foreign exchange crisis
and speculative capital outflows, and their replacement by an already
large and potentially sizable inflow of reserves. Since Canada had a
very strong trade account and also undertook heavy flotations of bonds
abroad during the first half of 1968, the reversal of speculative
capital outflows has caused a rapid increase in official foreign exchange
reserves. The reserves are approaching the $2,544 billion limit which
was agreed upon with the United States in exchange for the exemption
of Canada from the IET on new issues, and the Bank of Canada is easing
monetary policy partly, at least, in order to discourage a continuation
of this potentially embarrassing capital inflow.
The second major factor contributing to the Bank of Canada's
decision to ease credit conditions is provided by a combination of
soft domestic demand pressures and the March imposition of an income
tax surcharge. Since demand pressures had partially subsided by the
time the tax increase was passed, monetary policy was eased to maintain
domestic aggregate demand at desirable levels.
The decline in United States interest rates in recent months
provides a third cause for the downward trend in Canadian yields. The

VI -24 -
extensive integration of the financial markets of the two countries
means that Canadian interest rates have an inherent tendency to follow
the trend in United States yields, even in circumstances--unlike the
present--when Canadian economic objectives would seem to call for
an opposite trend.
Japan formally relaxed its tight money policy on August 7,
when the Bank of Japan reduced its basic discount rate from 6.21 per
cent to 5.84 per cent. This move restored the rate to the level pre-
vailing prior to January 6, 1968. Other interest rates were also
reduced in August. The over-month-end call loan rate was cut on
August 7 to 8.76 per cent from 9.13 per cent. On August 9 the Bankers'
Association reduced by 0.365 percentage points the maximum interest
rate on new loans.
The average interest rate on bank loans and discounts had
already leveled off in the second quarter at 7.52 per cent, having
risen from a low of 7.28 per cent reached last August. It is likely
that this rate will ease now, in line with the trend for other money
rates.
Selected long-term rates generally rose during the first
half of this year; unfortunately, more recent data are not available.
The yield on bank debentures increased from 8.51 per cent in January
to 8.84 per cent in June, and the yield on Japan's telegraph and tele-
phone bonds also rose from 8.70 to 8.83 per cent over the same period.

VI -25 -
Although some interest rates are declining, credit conditions
are likely to remain somewhat tight through September. The Bank of
Japan's current quarterly ceiling on the expansion of commerical bank
credit, which is relatively stringent, will remain in force through
September.

APPENDIX A: BANK LENDING PRACTICES SURVEY *
Four-fifths of the 125 banks reporting in the August 15 Bank
Lending Practices Survey indicated that demand for business loans was
essentially unchanged or moderately weaker during the preceding three
months (Table 1). This is in marked contrast to the previous survey,
in which 70 per cent of the banks expected that loan demand would be
stronger in this period. About 80 per cent of the respondent banks
now anticipate unchanged or moderately weaker loan demand over the
next three months ending in November. However, with loan/deposit ratios
still very high, most banks reported that lending policies in August
remained unchanged from those in May.
Interest rates and compensating balance requirements.
Nearly 85 per cent of the banks indicated essentially unchanged
interest rate policy on loans to business borrowers and 96 per cent re-
ported unchanged interest rate policy in dealing with independent finance
companies. Policies regarding compensating balances--which influence
the effective interest rate borrowers must pay--were also unchanged at
nearly all the banks on loans to both business borrowers and independent
finance companies, although, as with interest rate policy, this percent-
age was somewhat higher with respect to finance companies.
Other nonprice terms and conditions.
Nonprice terms and conditions on loans to businesses also were
unchanged at most of the reporting banks. However, a small percentage
of the banks reported moderate easing of policies on loans to new and
established customers, and to local service area customers.
Other types of loans.
For the most part, the willingness of banks to make other types
of loans was also unchanged since the preceding survey. Although about
one-fifth of the reporting banks were more willing to make single-family
mortgage loans, a somewhat smaller number reported that they were less
willing to make other types of mortgage loans. As in the last survey,
however, an appreciable number of banks reported that they had become
more willing to make consumer instalment loans.
Size of bank differences.
Demand for business loans as compared to three months ago, and
that anticipated in the next three months is reported to be somewhat
stronger at larger rather than smaller banks (Table 2). Generally, however,
no significant differences exist with respect to bank size as to policy
responses on interest rate, compensating balance, or nonprice terms and
conditions. Smaller banks indicated a firmer policy with respect to es-
tablishing new or larger credit lines to independent finance companies
than did larger banks. Large banks seemed less willing to make mortgage
loans, broker loans, and participation loans with correspondent banks.

Division of Research and Statistics.

A-2
Factors associated with policy changes.
While many banks commented that there had been no significant
changes in the last ninety days, several stated that since July 31 they
had begun to climb out of the tight money situation as a result of im-
proved deposit inflows. One bank in qualifying its essentially unchanged
policy indicated that it felt that conditions for the past year relating
to deposit levels, loan demand, interest rates, etc. had been character-
ized by considerable uncertainty.
Some indicated that with improved deposit inflows and with de-
mand for loans expected to be moderately weaker during the next three
months, they are presently considering a move to more active loan policy.
A Philadelphia bank said, "We are aggressively seeking any type of sound
and profitable loan." However, many banks point to continued high
loan/deposit ratios as the reason for their unchanged restrictive loan
policies.
Several banks in New York indicated less willingness to make
loans to brokers. One bank stated that it had all loans to brokers
under surveillance due to the difficulties that these institutions
were experiencing--paper jam, financial problems, etc.

APPENDIX B: CHANGES IN U.S. LIABILITIES TO FOREIGN OFFICIAL ACCOUNTS
The three tables appended deal successively with (1) the
financing of the U.S. balance of payments deficit, (2) the composition
of changes in U.S. liabilities to foreign official accounts, and (3)
the place of changes in U.S. liabilities among the official reserve trans-
actions of 7 continental European countries, and the relation of these
changes to the over-all balance of payments surpluses of this group of
countries.
The period covered is a 2-1/4-year interval starting from
March 31, 1966. This is divided into 6-month periods and one 3-month
period, chosen to avoid periods ending at midyear or December 31. The
following list will serve as a reminder of the state of economic affairs
in each period.
I. April-September 1966 Culmination of tight money.
Downturn in Germany and U.K.
II. Oct. 1966-Mar. 1967 Recessions in Europe and U.S.
Early-1967 revival of confidence
in sterling.
III. April-September, 1967 Beginnings of upturns.
IV. Oct. 1967-Mar. 1968 Sharp rise in U.S. imports.
Sterling devaluation.
Gold rush.
V. April-June, 1968 Further expansion.
French crisis.
Over these 27 months there was only a negligible net increase
(under $0.4 billion) in total U.S. liquid and near-liquid liabilities
to foreign official accounts apart from the transfer of U.K. security
portfolio proceeds to the U.K. reserves. (See last line of Table 1, with
footnote 2.) In period III, however, there was a large increase ($1.5
billion); together with a large increase in liquid liabilities to foreign
private accounts, including the foreign branches of U.S. banks, this
covered a very large over-all deficit ($4.4 billion at an annual rate, on
basis described in footnote 1 of Table 1) and also served to provide a
substantial amount of assistance to the United Kingdom (represented approxi-
mately by the $0.9 billion increase in official U.S. holdings of convertible
foreign currencies -- 4th line of Table 1). In period IV the U.S. deficit
increased further and even larger assistance was given the United Kingdom
than in period III, but the rise in U.S. liabilities to foreign official
accounts was reduced to negligible proportions (apart from the liquefying

B -2
of the British security portfolio), because gold sales jumped to $2.4
billion. These gold sales -- the amount includes, of course, the U.S.
share of gold pool sales -- were partly to central banks, partly to
other foreign buyers, and partly to domestic buyers. To the extent that
the other foreign buyers were moving out of currencies other than dollars,
their purchases caused reserve losses for the countries whose currencies
were involved; through the operation of the pool these reserve losses
took the form partly of gold losses in those countries and partly of re-
duction in U.S. liabilities.
In the second quarter of 1968 -- period V -- U.S. liabilities
to foreign accounts fell by $1.4 billion in three months, despite the
continuing large U.S. balance of payments deficit. As may be seen in the
last column of Table 1, this astonishing result was due mainly to the
extremely large ($2.3 billion) increase in U.S. liquid liabilities to
private foreign accounts, which in turn was made possible by flights of
private foreign funds out of sterling and the French franc, mainly via
the Euro-dollar market. Besides this, the period was a seasonally favor-
able one (to the extent of $0.3 billion). Other changes, mutually off-
setting, were an increase in our IMF position resulting from the British
and French IMF drawings, and a related reduction of our official holdings
of foreign currencies as the U.K. paid off Federal Reserve swap drawings.
Table 2 shows that over the 2-1/4 years under review the net
change in U.S. liabilities to foreign official accounts was made up as
follows:
To other than leading industrial countries +$1.4 billion
To Canada and Japan -.3
To United Kingdom (adjusted for portfolio
liquidation) -.6
To 7 Continental European countriesl/ -.1
Unallocated + .1
+$ .4 billion
The rise in liabilities to countries outside the Group of Ten took the
form mainly of an increase in time deposits of original maturity over one
year. Japan also acquired long-term time deposits and Canada took non-
marketable U.S. Treasury bonds denominated in U.S. dollars: "liquid"
dollar assets of these two countries were reduced by $1.5 billion. They
took no foreign currency claims on the United States.
The seven continental European countries took virtually no
long-term time deposits or nonmarketable U.S.-dollar securities, but they
increased their official foreign currency claims on the United States by
$0.5 billion.
I/ Including BIS.

B -3
The U.S.-dollar official claims of these countries on the
United States were reduced by $0.4 billion over the 2-1/4-year period
(next-to-last line of Table 3; excluding BIS). The last line of
Table 3 indicates that through swap drawings initiated by the Federal
Reserve, $0.8 billion of the $1.2 billion increase in such dollar
liabilities during periods I to IV -- from March 31, 1966 to March 31,
1968 -- was given exchange value guaranties; in the second quarter of
1968, when the dollar liabilities fell to these countries by $1.6
billion, the swap drawings on them were cut only $0.5 billion.
Table 3, line I, shows that the continental G-10 countries
had a fairly steady over-all balance of payments surplus (as measured
by changes in net external assets of commercial banks plus net official
reserve assets) between March 31, 1966 and March 31, 1968, at annual
rates between $1.5 and $2 billion, with seasonally more favorable results
in the April-to-September semesters. In these 24 months, their net offi-
cial reserve assets rose by $2.8 billion, with a similar seasonal variation.
It should be observed, however, that in period IV -- October 1967 to
March 1968 -- both the over-all surplus and the reserve gain would have
been larger if it had not been for gold-rush buying by holders of their
currencies.
In periods I and II, the increase in U.S. liabilities to offi-
cial accounts in these seven countries was substantially smaller than
their total net reserve asset gains, because they acquired some gold and
added substantially to their IMF and GAB positions. In period III, how-
ever, the U.S. liabilities increased by $1.2 billion, a little more than
the amount of net reserve gains.
The subsequent shrinkage in the rate of additions to U.S.
reserve liabilities to these countries was not due to the shrinkage,
seasonal or otherwise, in their over-all payments surplus, because this
shrinkage was more than compensated for by their gold losses. What
caused the slowing in rise of their claims on the United States was a
sharp increase in their reserve claims on other countries, primarily
on the United Kingdom.
In period V -- the three months April-June of this year -- U.S.
official reserve liabilities to the seven continental G-10 countries fell
by $1.5 billion. The decline occurred mainly in dollar holdings of
Germany and Italy; both countries purchased substantial amounts of gold,
and French and British drawings of their currencies through the IMF were
converted into dollars.

1/ This analysis deals with the balance financed by official reserve trans-
actions and increases in liquid liabilities to commercial banks abroad and
to other foreign private accounts. This is closely similar to the balance
on the liquidity basis before special transactions, except that it counts
"above the line " rather than as financing items, the following: all
changes in liabilities, liquid or nonliquid, to international institutions
other than the IMF; foreign prepayments of debts to the U.S. Government;
and certain special transactions other than changes in foreign official
holdings of nonmarketable U.S. Treasury debt and long-term time deposits.
In particular U.K. official transactions in U.S. corporate and Agency
securities are counted above the line.
2/ Would be $4.9 billion if adjusted for U.K. reserve addition from security
liquidations.
3/ Includes proceeds of U.K. security liquidations added to U.K. reserves
($490 million).
