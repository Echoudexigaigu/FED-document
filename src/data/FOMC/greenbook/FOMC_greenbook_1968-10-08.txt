of Governors of the Federal Reserve Syst em.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization proce ss which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain.

format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to rem ove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing). 
 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optical character recognition computer program (OCR) 
first created electronic text from the document im age.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, 
staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.  Pl ease note that the numbers and text in charts and

CURRENT ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL CONDITIONS

I- 1
SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK
Outlook for economic activity
A slower pace of economic activity is expected to continue
through the balance of the year, although it now appears likely to
be much less of a reduction from earlier this year than was projected
when the surtax was enacted. In the final two quarters, real expansion
in the economy is likely to drop to about half the 6 per cent rate of
the first half. The fourth quarter gain in GNP is expected to be
about the same as in the third quarter, with inventory accumulation
rising but all the components of final demand (except residential
construction), are expected to show a less vigorous performance than in
the third.
Consumer buying, both of durables and nondurables, rose
vigorously in July and was maintained at advanced levels in August
and September. With expenditures strong and the rise in disposable
income slowed considerably by the surtax, the rate of saving was
sharply curtailed. In the fourth quarter, disposable income is
expected to rise only moderately further and the rise in consumer
spending should slow appreciably. Only modest increases are expected
from other sectors of final demand. Federal spending and business
capital outlays are both projected as levelling off, and residential
construction expenditures should edge up.

I -2
The rate of inventory accumulation may rise, however, if
businessmen maintain output schedules but consumption growth eases
as projected. Price increases are likely to be only moderately
below the first half rate and wage pressures show few signs of
abatement.
Outlook for prices and resource use
The recent price situation has been characterized, on the
one hand, by a slowing of the rise in the CPI--after allowing for
usual seasonal changes in food prices and after excluding the
temporary sharp spurt in mortgage interest charges--and, on the other,
by a renewed pick-up in industrial prices. Retail food prices may
edge up contra-seasonally this autumn, although the rise is expected
to fall short of the increases last winter and early spring. The
rise in service prices has also slackened moderately from the extra-
ordinarily rapid rate in the early months of the year, and some
further slowing--at least for medical care costs--is a possibility.
No let-up has occurred yet in the rapid increases in retail
prices of non-food commodities. This autumn's price advance for
new cars apparently falls short of last year's, and, with consumer
demands generally expected to slacken in coming months, the advance
in retail prices of non-food commodities may slow. However, the spurt
in industrial commodity prices in September may renew upward pressures
at the retail level.

I-3
Industrial production declined somewhat further in September
because of the continued drop in steel output. The current steel
rate--down nearly a third from July--is permitting a sizable run-
off in steel inventories--and steel output may now be stabilizing.
With auto output vigorous, the production index may rise modestly
over the balance of the year from the current reduced level but
significant slack in industrial capacity utilization would remain.
Employment is expected to rise less rapidly in the fourth
quarter reflecting a probable employment dip in the industrial sector.
The unemployment rate is projected to rise slowly toward 4 per cent
from the 3-1/2 per cent rate in August.
Credit demands
Business credit demands are expected to remain moderate over
the next few months. The small 1/4 percentage point reduction in the
prime loan rate by most major banks is not expected to spark any surge
in loan growth at banks. Corporate income tax payments in October
and November will be relatively small by recent standards, though rising
to above year-ago levels in December. But some acceleration in
inventory rebuilding between now and year-end may sustain business
loan expansion at around late summer rates.
Corporate bond volume is coming months is likely to remain
around the current pace of three-quarters of a billion dollars per
month. Such a volume is about half as much as the exceptionally
high year ago rate, but still fairly substantial. The volume of
public utility financing is expected to remain relatively large, and

I-4
moderate-sized industrial companies appear to be floating issues at
a somewhat increased pace, perhaps taking advantage of the opening
offered by the paucity of large corporate borrowers in the market.
There is no evidence yet of a significant return of large borrowers
to the market: the liquidity position of corporations is no longer
deteriorating; their cash flow appears comfortable relative to need;
and bank funds are somewhat more readily available and slightly
less expensive.
Municipal bond volume is likely to remain at the very rapid
pace of recent months, reflecting both industrial revenue financing--
which should decline sharply after late December--and the coincident
marketing of several very large offerings currently on the docket.
In the latter part of October, the U.S. Government will announce the
refunding of maturing coupon issues ($5.5 billion of publicly held
issues mature in November and December), and will likely be raising
cash through the issuance of tax bills for payment during the second
half of October and might also raise some cash in conjunction with the
mid-November refunding.
The marketing of these U.S. Treasury and state and local
government issues is likely to exert some upward pressure on yields
in these areas, which under current market conditions appear low
relative to high grade corporate issues, partly for expectational
reasons. Upward yield movements on these issues might spread more
widely, but forthcoming business news will be critical in determining
interest rate trends.

I -5
Supply of f nds
The availability of funds for investment or lending by
financial institutions is not expected to improve substantially
further. Thus, developments on the supply side are not likely, in
themselves, to lead to further interest rate declines.
In weeks immediately prior to the September tax period,
banks appeared to have approached prevailing target levels for CD's,
and the volume of these deposits outstanding leveled off. In view
of the moderateness of the tax-period run-off, banks should be able
to reattain late August peak levels of outstandings rather quickly.
But thereafter, outstanding CD's are again expected to level off or
show only relatively slow growth, assuming that loan demands will
be moderate. The money supply, having declined on balance since
mid-August, is expected to turn upward again and to continue to
expand--though moderately--in the months immediately ahead.
Inflows of consumer-type time and savings deposits at
commercial banks are expected to remain close to recent levels in
the period immediately ahead, and inflows to thrift institutions are
likely to show perhaps a limited improvement. The rate of personal
saving is expected to continue near the reduced third quarter level,
so that there is no substantial basis for expecting a significant
expansion in the flow of consumer funds placed in financial assets.
And the share flowing into banks or other financial institutions
is not likely to rise much.

I -6
With savings inflows moderate, savings and loan associations
and mutual savings banks may not become more aggressive during coming
months in seeking out residential mortgage commitments. In line with
these and related prospects, yields on residential mortgages appear
likely to decline only to a limited extent in the fourth quarter from
current record or near-record levels. Although a tendency toward lower
mortgage yields will be reinforced by the usual drop in demands for
residential mortgage credit during the fall, the reduction in credit
demand probably will be less than seasonal in view of the continuing
momentum of underlying demand for housing.
Balance of payments
Recent discussions of the U.S. payments problem have reflected
a general expectation that the U.S. fiscal actions taken in June will
produce a significant underlying improvement in the U.S. payments posi-
tion in the months ahead. However, an inter-agency group of U.S. Govern-
ment analysts, meeting last week to assess the outlook for the balance
of payments, concluded that the prospective improvement will still leave
a substantial problem ahead.
The liquidity deficit before special transactions, which
diminished from $4.7 billion in 1967 to about a $3-1/2 billion annual
rate in the first nine months of 1968, was projected to widen again in
the fourth quarter, and to decline only to about $2-1/2 billion in 1969.
This would be a disappointing outcome, given the assumption that 1969
will be a cyclically favorable year for the U.S. balance of payments,

I -7
with little domestic growth during the first half year and continued
expansion abroad.
The export surplus on goods and services was projected by
the group to increase from a $2 billion annual rate in the first nine
months of 1968 to about $4-1/4 billion in 1969. But it was thought
that about half of this improvement might be offset by an adverse
shift in private capital flows (excluding flows of foreign liquid funds).
The recent reflow of U.S. bank credit is unlikely to continue; and inflows
of foreign nonliquid private capital may diminish from their unprecedented
1968 levels.
On the official settlements basis, it seems likely that the
surplus recorded thus far in 1968 will give way to renewed substantial
deficit in 1969 as inflows of foreign liquid funds subside or may even
be reversed. Some portion of such a deficit might be financed by U.K.
debt repayments to this country and by a rebuilding of official dollar
holdings by countries whose holdings were reduced in 1968. But it is
also possible that 1969 will bring renewed gold losses and U.S. recourse
to the IMF.

THE ECONOMIC PICTURE IN DETAIL
The Nonfinancial Scene
The gross national product. Growth in the economy slowed
in the quarter just ended--although by much less than was earlier
anticipated--and is expected to continue to grow at about that reduced
rate in the fourth quarter. Increases in current dollar GNP in excess
of $20 billion in the first two quarters of the year are expected
to be followed by a rise of about $14 billion in each of the last
two quarters. Real growth should show a comparable decline, from
over 6 per cent in the first half to less than half this rate in
the final two quarters. In the fourth quarter, private final sales
are expected to contribute significantly less to GNP growth and
inventory expansion to contribute more. The GNP deflator is
expected to ease to a 3.6 per cent annual rate of increase in the
fourth quarter from 4 per cent in the second.
A strong pickup in consumption expenditures was a major
factor sustaining growth in the third quarter. Although the increase
in personal income was unexpectedly large, the surtax limited
growth in disposable income to about $7 billion--only about 60 per
cent of the rise in the preceding quarter. But this drop was more
than offset in its effect on consumer expenditures by a sharp
reduction in the saving rate, from 7.5 to 6.5 per cent. Sales
of new domestic cars were especially strong, rising to an advanced
rate of 8.8 million annually--the highest since early 1966--probably
reflecting some advance buying to avoid price increases in the
new models. Nondurable goods sales also rose sharply, in part due

II -2
to sharp further advances in prices of apparel, footwear, and gasoline.
However, it is worth noting that after the strong surge in July
retail sales there appeared to be only a small further rise in
August and a slight decline in September. (A general revision
of the retail sales series, based on an improved sample, may result
in the rise in July being reduced to about 2 per cent over June
instead of the 3 per cent indicated in the old sample; growth in
August is indicated to be a little more than shown by the current
series.
Housing activity in the third quarter showed little rise,
but this contrasts sharply with the decline expected earlier.
Starts rose abruptly in July partly because of some special influences,
but remained at a rate in excess of 1.5 million units in August; the
rate now seems likely to average close to 1.5 million units for the
third quarter as a whole. Lifting of regulatory ceilings on
mortgage rates in some states probably contributed, along with lender
anticipations of larger savings inflows and lower mortgage rates
ahead. Underlying demand for housing is exceptionally strong.
A major factor in the slower growth in GNP in the third
quarter was the substantially smaller rate of inventory accumulation
than in the second quarter when steel and auto stocks were being
accumulated, at a rapid rate. Leveling-off in prime contracts for
Vietnam, as well as in unfilled orders for durable goods, suggests
that the protracted build-up of long lead-time items is tapering
off, and inventory changes from now on may be more closely linked
to changes in current and expected consumption--aside, of course,
from the continuing readjustment in steel inventories.

II -3
The speed of further growth in the GNP in the fourth quarter
depends to a large degree on the relative strength of consumer demand
and inventory accumulation. Following its rapid run-up in the third
quarter when the saving rate declined abruptly, consumption is
expected to grow more slowly in the current period and the saving
rate to hold at around its current reduced level. Personal income is
expected to expand less rapidly, limiting growth in disposable income
to a rate comparable to that in the third quarter when the
main impact of the surcharge was felt. Consumer purchases of autos
may drop somewhat if, as seems likely, there was bunching of demand
in the third quarter. We also have projected an increase in non-
durable goods sales slightly smaller than in the past quarter--a
still substantial rise despite the fact that there apparently has
been no growth in this category since July.
On the other hand, our estimates of inventory growth have
been revised up substantially since last month because of the strength
in demand shown in recent months and continued high levels of
industrial output. Inventory accumulation is now projected to rise
more rapidly in the fourth quarter, despite the fact that steel
inventories, which began to be used up in the third quarter, should
be drawn down faster in the October-December quarter. If auto sales
do decline as our projections indicate, there should be a further
rise in dealer's auto stocks, as producers are likely to continue
to schedule new models output at high rates. Nondurable goods stocks

are low relative to sales, and are likely to be increased somewhat.
In addition, if business is anticipating a stronger rise in final
sales in the fourth quarter,than is realized, as seems likely, some
unintended stock accumulation will occur.
Other sectors are expected to contribute little to growth
for the remainder of this year. Federal purchases of goods and
services, fixed investment, and residential construction combined
are now adding less to economic expansion than at any time since the
Vietnam buildup. These "autonomous" sectors added $10 billion to
GNP growth between the fourth quarter of 1967 and the second quarter
of this year, but are likely to add only half that between the second
and the fourth quarter. From the third to fourth quarter, in
particular, little rise in these components is expected. Investment
in plant and equipment is likely to show no further gain, as
suggested by the revisions in spending anticipations reported both
for the manufacturing and the commercial categories. Housing
expenditures may edge up somewhat in the fourth quarter, largely
because of the relatively advanced rate of starts in the preceding
quarter. The third quarter rate of starts will probably be main-
tained in the coming quarter, but a sharp rebound seems unlikely
before next year.

II -5
At present, there is no reason to modify greatly our previous
estimates of little growth in Federal goods and service outlays in
the current quarter. In order not to exceed NIA purchases as indicated
by the Budget Review, a downward trend for the rest of fiscal year is
implied. Thus, defense expenditures are expected to drop a little in
the fourth quarter, as the economy program bites harder. In addition,
grants to States are beginning to be curtailed, and sizable cuts have
already been made in Federal payrolls, in highway aid and other develop-
mental projects, NASA, and other programs. An increase above Budget
estimates of over one billion dollars in CCC and welfare payments (if
not exempted) may be offset by further cuts requested of Agriculture
and HEW, according to the mid-year Budget Review.
With receipts rising, and expenditures being curtailed,
the Federal deficit, NIA basis, is now expected to drop from over
$10 billion annual rate in the second quarter to about $3 in the fourth.
This drop, larger than previously anticipated, reflects a faster rise
in receipts due to unexpected strength in activity and incomes.

Industrial production. From June to August changes in the
total index of industrial production have been dominated by changes in
output of materials, as production of both consumer goods and business
equipment have been virtually unchanged. If these trends continued
in September, the total index is tentatively estimated to have
declined further, by about one-half to one point, from the pre-
liminary August level of 164.0 per cent.
In September, output of raw steel declined 10 per cent further
as steel consuming industries continued to reduce their metal
inventories. Output of crude oil was reduced 2.5 per cent because of
a cutback in Texas allowables and auto assemblies declined 3.5 per
cent because of start-up problems on production lines. Other avail-
able September output data--on paperboard, trucks, coal, and petroleum
refining--do not suggest any softening in production; and output
of these products remained at advanced levels.
Output changes for the balance of the year will most
likely depend on demands for consumer goods and business equipment.
While retail sales, based on a rough deflated measure, have increased
about 5 per cent over the past 12 months, output of these goods has
shown a similar rise. It is not yet clear, however, that the current
advanced level of sales is enough to be a spur to further expansion
of output of these products. More complete output data for
August and preliminary September data, which will become available
over the next 2 weeks, may provide a clue.

II -9
Output of business equipment has been on a plateau since
last October at a level about 3 per cent below the December 1966 high.
With the rate of capacity utilization in manufacturing below 83 per
cent,despite a 3-1/2 to 4 per cent increase in total manufacturing
output over the past 12 months, there does not appear to be any
great pressure to expand productive capacity generally in manufacturing.
Capacity utilization. The September rate of capacity utiliza-
tion is expected to be down a little further from the 83.2 per cent
level recorded in August. At its present level the operating rate
also is slightly below its previous low point which occured in
September and October of last year. Capacity still appears to be
expanding rapidly although not so fast as in the previous two years.
Operating rates appear moderately high in the motor vehicle
rubber, petroleum, and aircraft industries. Considerable unused
capacity exists for the production of most iron and steel, stone,
clay and glass, and machinery products.

Retail Sales. Retail sales in the three weeks ending
September 21 suggest a level for the month slightly below July and
August. Because of the sharp increase in July, however, sales for
the quarter as a whole were substantially above the second quarter.
The Bureau of the Census will shortly introduce a new
sample which is expected to result in some revisions for the period
since July 1967. The new sample apparently indicates a smaller rise
from June to July than that now published and a somewhat larger rise
from July to August.
Unit auto sales and stocks. Sales of new domestic autos
in the first 20 days of September were maintained at or slightly
above the August seasonally adjusted annual rate of 8.6 million
units. Stocks of new domestic autos increased more than seasonally
in the second ten-day period of September and on the 20th were 13
per cent above the end of August level and 19 per cent above a
year earlier. Some trade sources, however, regarded current
stocks as relatively low in view of the strong prospective sales
picture.
Consumer credit. Consumers continued to expand their
instalment debt in August at a rapid rate. Credit extended during
the month rose, while repayments slackened somewhat.
The increase in debt was concentrated in automobile
credit, especially purchased paper, Although auto sales in August
were somewhat below those in July, sales continued large and consumers

II -11
made more intensive use of bank credit in purchasing cars. The
expansion in auto credit use was nationwide. Credit appears to
have been used extensively by buyers brought into the August market
to avoid higher prices on 1969 models, and to take advantage of any
prive concessions available on 1968 models. Nonautomotive consumer
goods credit and personal loans were only moderately larger than in
July.
August repayments on auto credit outstanding fell below
the record monthly high of $2.4 billion, seasonally adjusted, reached
in July but were still near the level of other recent months. Repay-
ments on other types of instalment credit were well maintained.
Repayments currently are taking a somewhat smaller propor-
tion of disposable income than a year earlier. As shown in the table,
estimates for the third quarter indicate that repayments absorbed
only 14 per cent of disposable income, down from the sustained
high of 14.3 per cent in much of 1965 and early 1966, and .4 of a
point below the one-time peak a year ago.

Manufacturers' orders and shipments.- New orders received by
durable goods manufacturers rose by nearly 1 per cent in August but,
as in June and July, they remained below the level in the 6-month
period from last December through May. Declines in new orders for
iron and steel, nonferrous metals, and nonelectrical and electrical
machinery were more than offset in August by increases for transpor-
tation equipment--mainly outside the auto industry.
Unfilled orders of durable goods manufacturers rose fraction-
ally in August, largely because of a sharp decline in shipments. This was
l/ The series on manufacturers' shipments, orders, and inventories has
been revised, including adjustment to levels established by the 1963
Census and Annual Surveysand up-dating of seasonals. Total manufacturers'
shipments and new orders in 1967 were 2 per cent above previously reported
levels; the upward revisions were mainly in durables, partly offset by
downward revisions in nondurables. Durables shipments and orders were 7-8
per cent above the unrevised levels, The greatest year-to-year revision
in the durables series was 1965, when shipments and new orders show 3-1/2
per cent more increase over 1964 levels than previously estimated. The
recent monthly pattern of changes in orders has not been materially chnnged
by the revision.

II -13
the first increase in backlogs in four months and was concentrated
in the transportation equipment industries.
Manufacturers' shipments dropped sharply in August--
more than 3 per cent--with the bulk of the decline in durable goods
industries, where a drop of over 40 per cent for iron and steel
producers accounted for half the fall-off. Shipments by the aero-
space industry also declined sharply. Of other durable goods
industries only nonelectrical machinery and motor vehicles and parts
reported higher shipments.
Manufacturers' inventories. Book value of manufacturers'
inventories rose $1 billion in August, about four times the rise in
July. Except for a $900 million rise in May, the newly revised inventory
figures indicate that monthly increases since early last year had
seldom exceeded $400 million.
Two-thirds of the August increase was at durable goods
producers, with increases occurring in all major industries except
electrical machinery and instruments and related products. The
largest advances in August were at producers of iron and steel,
motor vehicles,and parts, and aircraft, missiles and parts. In the
durable goods sector materials and supplies, work in process, and
finished goods all showed increases. Inventories held by nondurable
goods producers increased somewhat more than the average increase of
the last eighteen months, with increases fairly widespread.

II -14
Construction and real estate. Seasonally adjusted private
housing starts, which had risen sharply in July from a reduced
May-June rate, continued above a 1.5 million unit annual rate in
August. Single family starts dropped as expected, after a fillip in
July, to one of the lowest rates this year and were also below a year
earlier. However, multifamily starts advanced further and approached
the recent peak of last April.
Regionally, housing starts in the Northeast, which had played
a major part in the rise during July when higher usury ceilings went
into effect in New York and New Jersey, dropped sharply in August.
And starts in the North Central states also declined. But in the West--
the only region which had not shared in the July advance--starts
soared to one of the highest rates for the year. Starts also rose
slightly in the South.
Seasonally adjusted residential building permits--revised
moderately upward in July--declined in August. Although multifamily
structures accounted for all the August drop, single and multifamily
permit rates were both relatively low. Altogether, they averaged
more than a tenth below the recent peak reached last March.
Apart from the downtrend in building permits, housing
starts in excess of a 1.5 million unit rate over the near-term would
hardly seem sustainable in view of the limited flow of loanable funds
to major lending institutions. Even if starts declined appreciably in
September, however, the average for the third quarter should exceed
the 1.44 million unit second quarter rate.

1/ Seasonally adjusted annual rates; preliminary.
Sales of existing homes in July averaged a fifth above a
year earlier, according to the National Association of Real Estate
Boards, reflecting in part recent upward adjustments in State usury
rate ceilings. Sales of new single family homes by speculative builders
rose during July to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 500,000 units,
the highest since April, but the stock of homes for sale by such
builders remained quite limited.
Personal income. Continuing its rapid rate of growth,
personal income rose $5 billion in August to reach a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of $694 billion. Wage and salary disbursements
accounted for $3-1/3 billion of the total rise. Although there was
some easing of demand for industrial labor this summer, rising wage
rates pushed gross payrolls in commodity-producing industries up at
a 4.8 per cent annual rate from May to August. Major support for the

II -16
rise in personal income, however, came from the nonindustrial sector,
where rising employment and increasing wages combined to expand pay-
rolls substantially. Sizable increases in government payrolls
reflected partly the Federal pay increase in July and partly a

Illustrative of the continuing sharp rise in pay levels,
wage and salary payments per employee rose at an annual rate close
to 6 per cent over the May-August period. In the nonindustrial
groups, where demands continued strong, the increases ranged from
4.6 to 8.5 per cent at annual rates. In the commodity-producing group,

II -17
such payments advanced at a comparatively moderate 4.3 per cent annual
rate; the average increase in these industries was held down by reduc-
tions in average hours--mostly in overtime--and by employment cut-
backs in high-wage construction and primary metals industries.
Transfer payments, which rose by $1.3 billion from May to
a record $59.5 billion (annual rate) in August, also contributed
significantly to the rise in personal income. There were also large
increases in personal interest income, which rose nearly $2 billion
from May to an annual rate of over $53 billion in August, and in
dividends, which rose to $25 billion in August.
Labor market. The labor market has continued to show considerable
firmness. Employment rose in the nonindustrial sector in August while
an unusual dip in the civilian labor force reduced the unemployment
rate to 3.5 per cent--equal to its post-Korean low, reached last
January and again in April and May. Firmness apparently continued
into late September, with insured unemployment near record lows and
no signs of significant layoffs outside of the steel industry.
Despite this picture of strength there have been several
hints of easing. Industrial employment has shown no change for
several months, the manufacturing workweek--a generally reliable
lead indicator--has moved down somewhat, and labor force growth has
been below normal for the past half year. Leveling in industrial
demand for labor in August was overshadowed by an increase of about
210,000 in nonindustrial employment. Service employment, which rose
only slightly from February to May, has risen considerably since May.

II -18
Demands also have intensified in State and local government where
employment rose substantially from May to August.
On the supply side, the civilian labor force as a whole
declined by some 300,000 in August (seasonally adjusted). As a
result, the labor force was no higher than six months earlier,
and was only 1.1 million above a year ago--an increase of about
1.4 million is considered normal. A similar pattern of no labor
force growth developed for several months during the economic
slowdown early last year and served to keep the unemployment rate
down for a period. The decline in the unemployment rate in August
appeared to be closely associated with contraction of the labor
force, which was related in part to the impending end of school
vacations. The August decline in unemployment was sharpest among
teenagers, whose unemployment rate fell one and a half points to
12.0 per cent. The employment status of the major component of the
labor force--adult males--remained unchanged, and the unemployment
rate for adult women edged lower.
Wages and industrial relations. Upward pressure on wages
is expected to ease somewhat as the tempo of collective bargaining
activity slackens in the final quarter of 1968. Less than half a
million workers are covered by contracts which expire or provide
for wage reopening, compared with 1.3 million in the third quarter.
Deferred wage increases and cost-of-living adjustments in the fourth
quarter will affect about 1.2 million workers under major contracts

II -19
negotiated last year in automobiles and related industries. But
these increases will average around 5 per cent compared with average
first-year increases of 7 per cent or more negotiated in settlements
reached so far this year.
Contract expirations in manufacturing are concentrated in
the aerospace industry, where several recent settlements have
probably set the pattern for an increase estimated at 6-1/2 per
cent or more in wage and fringe costs.
Outside manufacturing, settlements have not been reached
in two key negotiations--coal and shipping. More than 60,000 dock
workers in East and Gulf coast ports went out on strike upon expira-
tion of their contract September 30. Upon advice that the strike
would endanger the national health and safety, the President set
in motion the procedure for obtaining an injunction under the Taft-
Hartley law. The report by a 3-man Board of Inquiry, appointed
by the President, that no settlement could be reached resulted
in a temporary restraining order prior to issuance of an injunction
ordering the union back to work for an 80-day "cooling off" period.
The longshoremen are expected to go back to work October 3. Job
security to cushion the impact of containerization and a guaranteed
work-year of 2,080 hours are the main unresolved issues. The
Bituminous Coal operators and 80,000 miners have not yet reached
settlement on a new contract. Misunderstanding as to the termination
date of the old contract (thought to be September 30 rather than
October 9) has led to a walkout of several thousand miners.

II -20
Wholesale prices. Following some months of little change,
average prices of industrial commodities increased an estimated
0.3 per cent from mid-August to mid-September--the largest rise
since late last winter. Steel price increases announced in early
August (but not effective until after the August pricing date)
accounted for part of the September rise, but in addition there were
increases in many other categories. Preliminary September figures
suggest a sizable further increase in the diffusion of industrial
price increases (final August data show the beginning of a move up-
ward. from the low May-to-July level), perhaps back close to the
March-April proportions, but still well below the peaks reached last
January and February. Since the BLS September pricing date
(September 10), a number of additional price increases have been
announced, particularly for a variety of industrial chemicals and
for 1969 model cars. Thus a further appreciable rise in industrial
prices is likely this month.
Accompanying the step-up in industrial prices in September,
prices of farm products and processed foods and feeds reversed roughly
half of their sizable decline in August. The BLS overall wholesale
price rose an estimated 0.4 per cent, returning to the July level
of 109.1 per cent of the 1957-59 average. The estimated September
WPI was 2.7 per cent above a year earlier, with agricultural products
up 3.1 per cent and industrial commodities up 2.5 per cent.

II -21
The most conspicuous industrial price advances reported by
BLS in September were for steel and lumber and plywood. Lumber
and plywood prices continued upward over the summer--although at a
less rapid pace than last winter and early spring--and by mid-
September were up a fourth from early 1967. With a weight of about
2 per cent, these prices have accounted for 15 per cent of the total
increase for industrial commodities since mid-1967.
Prices of steel mill products were virtually stable from
May through mid-August. The average increase reported to BLS for
their mid-September index fell short of the 2-1/2 per cent indicated
by trade reports, suggesting a lag in application of some of the
increases announced earlier.
Altogether, the steel and lumber price increases accounted
for about 0.1 percentage point--or one-third--of the estimated 0.3
rise in industrial prices in September. In addition to these major
increases there was a fairly widespread scattering of small increases
in the textile and apparel, hides and leather, paper, metals and
metal products, machinery and equipment, and furniture and household
durables groups. These increases generally reflected a continuation
of August developments, except for the leather, paper, and metals
groups which had been unchanged or declined slightly in August.
The continuing advance in lumber-plywood prices,
supplemented by gains in textile materials and hides and leather,
have more than offset a small further drift-down in nonferrous metals

II -22
prices (copper prices have tended to stabilize or increase somewhat
recently, while lead, gold and silver prices have declined), and the
FR index of sensitive industrial materials has moved up appreciably
from its low reached in June.

Consumer prices. The consumer price index rose 0.3
per cent in August, to 121.9 per cent of the 1957-59 average. Since
April, the CPI has been running 4 per cent or more above the corres-
ponding year-earlier month; this represents the largest year-over-year
rise since the beginning of 1952.
The August increase fell back to about the average rise
during the first 5 months of the year, following the temporary spurt
to a monthly rate of 0.5 per cent in June and July. The abrupt speed-
up in the CPI in June and July can be attributed mainly to a sharp
rise in the BLS series representing mortgage interest charges (mortgage

II -23
interest rates adjusted, among other things, for changes--in recent
months, large increases--in new house prices). In each of these
two months the rise in mortgage interest accounted for around
one-fourth of the total increase in the CPI. As indicated in
the table, the CPI excluding mortgage interest increased at an
annual rate of 4.7 per cent in June and 4.4 per cent in July, where-
as, the total CPI rose at a 6 per cent rate in those months. As
also shown in the table, mortgage interest (which has a weight of
only 3 per cent) did not influence the CPI over the first 5 months
of the year--when the CPI rose at an average annual rate of 4.3 per
cent with mortgage interest up by about the same amount.
The rise in mortgage interest continued in August, but at
a slower pace (2.3 per cent as compared with a monthly average of over
4 per cent in June and July). This slowing and a pronounced drop in
the rate of increase in medical services--to the smallest rise in
more than 2 years--largely accounted for the slackening of the
increase in the CPI from July to August.
The unprecedented 11 per cent rise in mortgage interest
charges, as measured by BLS, between May and August apparently
followed in large part from the one-time boost in the statutory rate
ceilings on FHA- and VA-guaranteed home loans and from the lifting
of legal ceilings in rates in various states. According to the FHA
and FHLBB series, mortgage interest rates are now leveling off.

II -24
In addition to mortgage interest, food price changes are
of special interest in viewing recent changes in the CPI. In June
and July a large rise in food prices accounted for about one-fourth of
the over-all increase in the CPI, but this rise was less than expected
seasonally and the published BLS seasonally adjusted food price index
declined somewhat. Thus after allowing for seasonals in food prices--
as well as for other commodities--the rise in the CPI in June and
July was slower than in the first 5 months of the year.
In August, food prices showed a contra-seasonal rise--tending
to boost sharply the rise in the total CPI when calculated using
seasonally adjusted indexes for commodity prices. While the August
rise more than offset the decline over the preceding 2 months,
seasonally adjusted food prices increased at only a one per cent
annual rate between May and August--prices of food at home declined
moderately over that period--as compared with a rate of 6 percent
from December 1957 to May.
There has been no let-up in the rapid advance in retail
prices of non-food commodities. Apparel and furniture prices rose
sharply further in August, and major appliances continued to move
up. Despite a slightly larger-than-seasonal decline in new car
prices, prices of commodities less food--after allowances for seasonal
influences--increased both in August and, on average, from May to
August at an annual rate of over 4 per cent, as compared with 3.7
per cent in the first 5 months of the year.

II -25
Recently announced increases for 1969 model cars and also
for household durables and clothing, as well as a prospective carry-
through of materials' price increases now taking place at wholesale,
are likely to keep retail prices of non-food commodities moving upward.
It will be important, however, to assess retail price changes this
autumn in terms of expected seasonal behavior. BLS current seasonals
allow for a 1.3 per cent increase in apparel prices between August
and October, the period of introduction of winter clothing; they also
allow for a 3.5 per cent increase in new car prices in October--
when, by BLS practice, new models are first priced--followed by another
1.1 per cent increase in November.

Supplies of livestock products. Retail prices of meats
and other livestock products have been advancing since the beginning
of the year even though per capita supplies have exceeded record
1967 levels in every month since March. In August, the retail
price index was 3.2 per cent above a year earlier and exceeded the
October 1966 record by 1 per cent. The usual slackening in prices
of these products in the fourth quarter associated with seasonally
expanding supplies is likely to be moderate this year because consumer
demand continues strong while supplies of some livestock products
are indicated to be smaller than a year earlier.
Smaller marketings of eggs, turkeys, and hogs reflect
producer decisions earlier in the year to scale down production.
The official September survey indicates that pork production, at a
seasonal peak in the fourth quarter, will probably fall 1 or 2 per cent
short of last year's large output. However, after the turn of the
year, production is expected to rise above a year earlier. Short
egg supplies are likely to extend through the fourth quarter and
beyond because producers have reduced flocks and cannot rebuild
them quickly. Turkey supplies in the fourth quarter may be 5 to 10
per cent less than the huge supplies of a year earlier. Milk production
will probably be down about 2 per cent as it has been throughout the
year.
Production of broiler meat is expanding rapidly and in
the fourth quarter is expected to average 4 to 5 per cent above a
year earlier. Fed beef production is likely to be considerably

II -27
above a year earlier unless the survey of cattle on feed available
on October 17 contradicts other indicators. Domestic production
of non-fed beef is expected to be little changed from a year
earlier, but imports from Australia and New Zealand may be curtailed
toward the year's end, either through imposition of quotas or through
agreement.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL SITUATION
Bank credit. Total loans and investments at all commercial
banks are estimated to have increased at approximately an 11 per cent
annual rate in September, about half the rapid July-August growth rate
that resulted principally from heavy bank participation in large
Treasury financings as CD funds became readily available. About two-
thirds of the September increase reflects further loan expansion,
although growth in business loans slackened considerably from the pace
of recent months. Banks continued to take large amounts of municipal
issues into portfolio--as has been the case since deposit inflows
increased around midyear--but made no further net additions to their
holdings of U.S. Government securities.

III -2
The halt of U.S. Government security acquisitions in September
reflects the absence of any major Treasury financing, and is in sharp
contrast with the rapid increase in bank holdings of these securities
over the preceding two months. There was some maturity switching at
large banks outside New York, where purchases of bills and short-term
notes were approximately offset by sales of longer-term Governments,
which probably included some of the 6-year notes acquired in the August
financing.
Banks did, however, add $1.1 billion to their holdings of
other securities in September--at about a 20 per cent annual rate--
bringing net acquisitions since midyear to over $3.0 billion. As in
recent months, the September increase was mainly at large banks and was
concentrated in municipals--both long and short term. At nonweekly
reporting banks, where CD's are relatively unimportant and deposit
inflows have not accelerated so much since midyear, acquisitions of
municipals and agency issues have continued at about the same pace as
earlier in the year.
In spite of the increase in corporate tax liabilities in
September, business loans are estimated to have increased by only $400
million, about half of the average monthly increase in the preceding
three months. Apparently, corporations were fairly well prepared to
meet their higher tax payments, and the ratio of business borrowing
over the tax date to total tax payments remained essentially the same
as in recent years. Corporate liquidation of commercial paper and CD's
during the tax period also was moderate.

III -3
Business borrowing at banks both before and after the tax
period was relatively light in September. With the exception of some
continued strength in textiles, construction, and primary metals (prob-
ably to finance expanded plant and equipment programs), most industrial
categories displayed about normal or somewhat less than normal expansion
in business loans during these weeks. As it became apparent to banks
that loan demand was somewhat weaker, scattered reductions in the prime
lending rate began to occur early in September, with widespread reduc-
tions taking place towards the end of the month. The prime rate is now
split, with Chase Manhattan and a few other banks at 6 per cent, while
most banks are quoting 6-1/4 per cent.
Security loans increased moderately further in September--
bringing the total increase since midyear to about $3.5 billion--as
dealers generally maintained a relatively high level of speculative
inventories in anticipation that interest rates are still likely to
decline further. Growth in consumer loans continued at the increased
pace that has prevailed since around midyear, reflecting principally,
as in recent months, the financing of a large volume of automobile
sales. Real estate loans in September increased at a slightly more
rapid rate than in recent months, and may reflect some easing of bank
mortgage lending policies in response to improved availability of funds.
Bank deposits. Time and savings deposits at all commercial
banks in September are estimated to have increased by an additional
$2.7 billion, on a daily average basis--approximately the average monthly

III -4
increase in July and August--or at about a 17.0 per cent annual rate.
The September increase resulted primarily from a much less than seasonal
decline in outstanding CD's. Moreover, inflows of consumer-type time
and savings deposits expanded at a slightly higher rate than the increased
pace of August.

With the recent slowing of loan demand and with the large
volume of CD's outstanding, banks allowed their CD's to decline during
the first three weeks in September. However, this reduction--about two-
thirds of which occurred at New York banks--was only about half the size
of declines in comparable periods of other recent years, and in the week
ending September 25, banks in New York and Chicago added nearly $300
million to their outstandings. Throughout most of the month, moderate

III -5
reductions were posted in offering rates on all but the shortest-
maturity CD's. Following the more widespread decline in prime lending
rates that occurred late in the month, major New York banks are reported
to have reduced their offering rates to 5.50 per cent on CD's maturing
in three months or less, and to 5.625 on CD's maturing in more than
three months--somewhat lower than the rates reported in the latest survey
(September 25).
Consumer-type time and savings deposit inflows at large banks
improved somewhat further in September after having shown a slightly
higher rate of growth in August than had prevailed in the previous two
months. Most of the September increase in these deposits reflects
inflows of time certificates and open accounts, which were larger than
in comparable periods of most other years, and than in recent months of
this year. Savings deposit inflows at large banks also improved in
September, although they still remained below those in comparable periods
of most recent years.
With the cost of Euro-dollars still attractive relative to
that of CD's in September, banks continued to rely heavily on the Euro-
dollar market for funds through the tax date. Over the three weeks
ending September 18, bank liabilities to foreign branches rose about
$550 million, following an increase of nearly $900 million in August.
In the week ending September 25, however, these liabilities fell $500
million, bringing the current level back to about $7.1 billion.
Following the moderate August increase, the money stock, on
a daily average basis, is estimated to have declined at a 5.5 per cent

III -6
annual rate in September. This reduction--which reflects primarily a
shift from private demand deposits into U.S. Government deposits to meet
tax payments--brings the growth in the money stock over the third quarter
down to a 4.5 per cent annual rate.
Over the past twelve months, the money stock has risen by
about 5.8 per cent, as compared with an estimated 9.0 per cent increase
in GNP, measured in current dollars. Although all other liquid assets
held by the public (time and savings deposits at commercial banks and
mutual savings banks, savings and loan shares, U.S. Government savings
bonds, and U.S. Government securities maturing within one year) increased
more rapidly than the money stock over this period, they also expanded
less than GNP, resulting in a rather steady decline in the ratio of total
liquid assets to GNP.
Nonbank depositary intermediaries. In August, there was only
limited recovery in net savings inflows to the mutual savings banks and
the savings and loan associations, despite the general downtrend of
market interest rates. The absence of greater strength in inflows may
reflect the sharp decline in the personal savings rate during the third
quarter that accompanied the increase in withholding tax payments. How-
ever, data lags make it difficult to assess the current pace of inflows
to these intermediaries.

During the September grace days of the current reinvestment
period, the largest New York City mutual savings banks are reported to
have experienced only minimal outflows. During the past several rein-
vestment periods, however, the experience during the early "grace" days
has proven an unrealiable indicator of the over-all experience. Unfor-
tunately, little additional information is expected prior to the FOMC
meeting.
Liquidity ratios of savings and loan associations declined
much more than seasonally in July and August, reaching their lowest
levels since the end of 1966. This development reflects the lower
minimum liquidity requirements announced by the FHLBB in July, and no
doubt helped sustain S&L mortgage lending activity during July and
August. With outstanding commitments already high relative to recent
cash flows available for mortgage investment, some further reduction
in liquidity seems probable unless savings flows pick up.

III -8
Mortgage market developments. Limited evidence suggests that
the residential mortgage market again eased slightly during September,
especially in the secondary market dominated by the more diversified
types of lenders. Although the volume of 6-month bids accepted by FNMA
in its forward commitment auction declined during the month as a whole,
implicit yields on auctioned FHA and VA home mortgages continued to edge
down, as the table shows. In addition, improvement in the availability
of mortgage credit is suggested by a further seasonally adjusted uptrend
in weekly applications to FHA for insurance of existing home mortgages
through the week ended September 26, the latest available date.

These fragmentary developments imply a continuance during
September of the slightly easing supply pressures now confirmed by
official data for August. Reflecting in part the sustained volume of
mortgage acquisitions by thrift institutions associated with a reduction
in liquidity positions and slightly greater savings inflows in August,
plus anticipations of further improvements in cash flows, yields on
conventional home mortgages in the lagging primary market remained
unchanged in August for the first time in 6 months. This followed a
marked rise earlier in the year which was abetted by upward revisions
in usury ceilings in some Eastern States.
In the more sensitive secondary market, moreover, yields on
certain FHA-insured home mortgages declined during August for the second
consecutive month, as the table shows. Average discounts required by
lenders on these Government underwritten mortgages dropped further to
5 points. Although this was the lowest level in more than a year, it
was still high enough to discourage some financing under the regular
FHA-VA home loan insurance programs.

Note: FHA series: interest rates on conventional first mortgages
(excluding additional fees and charges) are rounded to the
nearest 5 basis points; secondary market yields and discounts
are for certain 6 per cent, FHA-insured Sec. 203 loans through
April with data for May 1968 estimated by Federal Reserve based
on the new 6-3/4 per cent regulatory rate. Gross yield spread
is average mortgage return, before deducting servicing fees,
minus average yield on new issues of high grade corporate bonds.
Since average yields on new issues of high grade corporate
bonds declined considerably during August, gross yield spreads favoring
home mortgages widened sharply to the largest margins in a year and a
half. Even so, yields on home mortgages undoubtedly remained consider-
ably less attractive than returns on multifamily or commercial mortgages,
some of which carry equity-type participations as well.

III -11
In August, the aggregate dollar volume of outstanding
mortgage commitments of all savings and loan associations and New York
State savings banks again increased slightly, on a seasonally adjusted
basis, to reach a new high 3 per cent above the spring peak and a seventh
above a year earlier. At least for reporting savings banks, nearly all
(86 per cent) of the year-over-year increase reflected an expansion in
long-term commitments scheduled to mature more than 9 months later.
During the same period, commitments likely to be taken down over the
near term to finance new or existing properties rose very little.
Corporate and municipal bond markets. Yields on new corporate
bonds changed little on balance during September and at month-end remained
almost 15 basis points above their August lows. Municipal yields, how-
ever, have declined about 10 to 15 basis points over the past three weeks,
erasing nearly one-half of their August to early September advance.

Bond markets had come under pressure in late August as the
previous expectation for a sharp moderation in economic growth during
the third quarter was shaken by a rash of bullish economic statistics.
During September, however, corporate yields generally stabilized as
underwriters were willing to hold the line on reoffering yields in view
of the continuing moderate volume of new issues. But their inventory
position began to rise as the distribution of many new issues proved
sluggish. This development reflected the large volume of attractively
priced competing instruments--such as the $250 million World Bank issue
and an equally large FNMA offering--and the failure of prime rate reduc-
tions late in the month to spur investor interest in new issues at
prevailing yields. Most recently, the over-all market weakened when
underwriters reduced their inventory with the termination of syndicate
price restrictions on a sizable, slow moving offering.
The ultimate volume of publicly-offered corporate bonds in
September--at $725 million--showed little change from that estimated
earlier. Although this placed September offerings about $100 million
above the August seasonal lull, this level of issues nonetheless repre-
sents a significant decline from the average volume of such offerings
earlier this year. Including private placements, total corporate
security offerings in September, are estimated to have aggregated $1.7
billion--a small decline from the average monthly volume so far this
year.

Flotations of corporate bond offerings in October are expected
to increase from the volume of public issues in September and are tenta-
tively estimated at $850 million. Although offerings remain below the
previous outsized volume, they still are relatively large. Public
utility companies have been financing in record volume this year and the
forward calendar continues to carry a sizable number of such issues. In
addition to these offerings, there are a notable number of issues by
small to medium size manufacturing corporations that have partially off-
set the reduced number of large offerings by prime industrial borrowers.
At least some of these offerings may represent financing that was
deferred earlier when the calendar was pre-empted by prime companies.
Many of these non-utility offerings carry convertible features as some
borrowers are taking advantage of the more favorable stock market outlook
indicated by the recent rise in stock prices. The total volume ofI

III -14
corporate security offerings in October, however, will likely be
unchanged from September--at $1.7 billion--as a seasonal decline in
privately placed bonds will offset the expected rise in public bond
offerings.
In the municipal market the September downturn in yields was
primarily a reflection of strong bank demand. With sizable time deposit
inflows coupled with relatively modest business loan demand, commercial
banks reportedly have continued to acquire municipal securities at a
rapid rate.
Municipal bond new issue volume has fluctuated sharply from
month-to-month as some large offerings have been shifted on the calendar.
The estimated volume for September has been reduced to $1,250 million,
placing September more than $400 million below August. Over one-half
of this decline is attributable to the temporary delay in bringing a
negotiated revenue bond issue--now scheduled for October--to market.
The October volume will show a sharp jump to about $1.6 billion and may
well include at least five issues of $100 million or larger in size.
The increased volume of industrial revenue bond issues over
the past few months in large measure accounts for the rise in municipal
offerings, and more than one-fifth of the October calendar represents
such financing. At year end, when all but the smallest issues of such
bonds will become taxable, industrial revenue financing is expected to
become minimal.-
1/ A rider to a bill currently in House-Senate Conference Committee
would raise the issue size exempt from Federal income taxes to $5
million--from the $1 million limit imposed earlier this year. While
issues under $5 million represented 74 per cent of total industrial
offerings in 1967, they constituted only 13 per cent of dollar volume.

Stock market. On sharply increased trading volume, the
advance in common stock prices since late August has carried the major
market price indices slightly above the historic highs reached in mid-
July. The recent rise in stock prices has apparently been associated
in part with increased institutional purchases--as indicated by the
increase in large block transactions after a sharp decline in such
purchases in August. Mutual funds, in particular, had been reportedly
in a very liquid position over the summer months and hence in a position
to increase their market activity. More generally, however, the con-
tinued indications of strong economic growth, and press reports of
upward revisions of GNP forecasts, have probably played a key role in
the reevaluation of stock arket values in recent weeks.

For the second consecutive month, margin debt at brokers
declined in August by $120 million; this reduction in debt, coupled with
the modest increase in stock prices on the New York Stock Exchange, led
to a slight increase in customers' equity in their margin accounts with
brokers. Bank purpose loans at reporting banks--which unfortunately
include some loans on corporate bonds--increased by $60 million in August.
The back-office problems of brokerages, although somewhat
improved, were apparently still large enough to force continuance of
Wednesday Exchange closings at least through October 9. The New York
Exchange, however, has implied that a return to a 5-day week may soon be
possible.

Government securities market. Since the discount rate cut
in mid-August, yields on Treasury bills have fluctuated considerably
but without any decisive trend. From their high to their low points,
these variations have ranged generally from 10-20 basis points. Yields
on coupon issues have also fluctuated, although characteristically by
smaller amounts, generally in the same direction as bill yields.
This indecisive pattern of change reflects the wait-and-see
attitude now generally prevalent among market participants regarding
the likely future course of economic activity and interest rates.
Movements that have occurred, while partly seasonal, have been accen-
tuated by special factors such as the unexpectedly large drain on the
Treasury balance at the Federal Reserve prior to the quarterly corporate
tax payment date. In addition, yields have continued to respond to any
developments which seemed, even temporarily, to increase or decrease
the odds that earlier market expectations of lower interest rates later
in the year will in fact be realized.

Early in September, Treasury bill yields had drifted higher,
raising the quote on the three-month issue to a recent high of 5.30 per
cent at the time of the last Open Market Committee meeting. In this
period, continued high financing costs and heavy System selling--both
for its own and foreign accounts--had encouraged dealers to try to
lighten their positions. The magnitude of System selling was augmented
because the unexpectedly large drains on the Treasury balance at Federal
Reserve Banks increased the System's need to absorb reserves. At the
same time market participants were assuming a generally cautious atti-
tude because they were unsure how strongly money market pressures would
be accentuated by business demands on banks stemming from the added
burden on corporations created by the June tax legislation.
The absence of unusual market pressures around the tax date;
the switch of Desk operations to the buy side of the market as the
Treasury balance was replenished; the reappearance of demands for bills
from other investors (partly in anticipation of the quarterly statement
date at banks); and the general easing of money market conditions that
developed in the period of transition to the new lagged reserve adjust-
ment system--all contributed to declines in bill yields during the
middle weeks of September. Most recently, however, with day-to-day
money market conditions showing a tendency to tighten again and with
dealers beginning to look ahead to large Treasury cash and refinancing
operations, Treasury yields have turned up. The yield on three-month
bills rose from 5.09 per cent on September 26 to 5.21 per cent in early
October. Recent rate changes on other short-term market instruments

III -19
have all been downward, however, as the table shows, reflecting the
usual tendency of such rates to lag behind changes in Treasury bill
yields.
With the period of large forthcoming Treasury financing
operations becoming more imminent, dealers have made some further pro-
gress in reducing their holdings of Treasury coupon issues. But their
aggregate holdings of longer-term issues are still quite sizable.

Federal finance. On the basis of daily Treasury data and
monthly statements through August, Federal expenditures are estimated
to have leveled off significantly during the third quarter of 1968
following large increases in earlier quarters. Early in the third
quarter, the spending level was raised $1.6 billion by Federal pay
raises, and present estimates indicate an over-all increase of $3.9
billion for the full quarter.

basis. Data do not allow for an additional increase of $1.0 billion
in nondefense expenditures that would be likely if the House con-
firms recent Senate action exempting CCC price-support payments from
the Budget ceiling.
Defense purchases are estimated to have increased by $1.5
billion in the third quarter, but to meet the Summer Budget Review
projection they would have to decline moderately during the remainder
of the fiscal year. While an actual decline in defense is considered

III -22
unlikely by some forecasters, a leveling out in defense spending would
be consistent with the behavior of advance indicators, such as data on
obligations and contracts.
Nondefense expenditures increased by an estimated $2.4 billion
in the third quarter, and moderate further increases are expected during
the remainder of the fiscal year even if Congress does not allow addi-
tional exemptions, such as that discussed for CCC price-support.
As regards the immediate outlook for financing needs, the
Treasury entered the month of October with a higher than normal operating
balance of $8.6 billion. The balance had increased during September, as
sizable corporate tax payments were collected. To cover the large,
mainly seasonal, deficit projected for October, the Treasury is expected
to raise about $3.5 billion in tax bills before announcing the November
refunding in the latter part of October. The public holds about $4.0
billion of notes and bonds that mature in mid-November and another $1.6
billion of bonds that mature mid-December. The latter issue is expected
to be included in the November refinancing. The projected cash financing
in October will need to be supplemented by one additional cash borrowing
operation before the end of the fourth quarter.

Exchange market and gold developments. During the last
three weeks of September the general atmosphere in exchange markets
improved considerably, as rumors of a German mark revaluation
subsided. The Bundesbank's market purchases of dollars in the last
three weeks of the month totaled about $260 million, while its swaps
with German banks (in which it sells dollars spot and buys dollars
forward) came to $390 million, compared to nearly $1.7 billion in
market purchases and $1.2 billion in swaps between August 26 and
September 6. The market atmosphere, however, remains unsettled,
and the possibility of renewed speculative buying of marks will
probably remain real for some time to come.
Sterling advanced sharply on September 9 on the news that
the final arrangements for the sterling balances assistance package
for the British had been successfully negotiated at Basle; sterling
was given a further boost at mid-month when the British trade
figures for August were released. The spot exchange rate for the
pound advanced from about $2.3830 on September 6 to about $2.3900
today (October 2), and the discount on three-month forward sterling

IV -2
declined from around 2.8 per cent per annum in the first week of
September to about 1.6 per cent by month-end. Even though there
was a moderate decline in U.K. local authority deposit rates
relative to Euro-dollar rates during the month, the narrowing of
the discount on forward sterling was sufficient to reduce the
covered margin in favor of Euro-dollars from nearly 120 points in
the first week of September to about 35 points on October 1.
The French franc remained under severe selling pressure
until the last week of September when a marked easing of the
pressure occurred. Bank of France net sales of dollars between
September 23 and 30 were far smaller than earlier.
Gold market activity picked up beginning September 27
and prices were marked down substantially in the course of the
next several days. Earlier, prices had advanced from just under
$40.00 to about $40.50. By Wednesday, October 2, the second
fixing price in London was reduced to $38.90. Knowledge that
the South African gold policy issue would be under discussion at
this week's IMF meeting no doubt has influenced the market.
Euro-dollar market. U.S. banks increased their use of
Euro-dollar funds during August and until after mid-September,
enlarging their liabilities to overseas branches by $765 million
between August 14 and September 18. Interest rates in the Euro-
dollar market tended to rise in the latter part of August but
declined substantially during most of September, as large supplies

IV -3
of funds came to the market as a result of movements out of sterling
and French franc assets on the part of private holders.
Despite an unusually wide cost differential favoring use of
Euro-dollar funds by U.S. banks, in the week ended September 25 the
U.S. banks reduced their liabilities to branches by about $500 million,
apparently reacting to the increased availability of alternative do-
mestic sources of funds after the mid-September tax date. Since then
Euro-dollar rates have risen (the call rate from 5-3/8 to 5-7/8 per
cent, and the 3-month rate from under 5-3/4 to 6-1/8 per cent) and
New York banks have further reduced their liabilities to branches.
U.S. balance of payments. In the quarter just ended the
liquidity deficit -- seasonally adjusted and before special trans-
actions -- seems to have registered an annual rate of about $3 billion,
compared to a rate of $3.8 billion in the first six months of the year.
Since the figures for September are incomplete, the third quarter
result is still tentative. Special transactions (detailed in
Appendix B) have been exceptionally large, totalling nearly $500 mil-
lion in the third quarter and over $1.5 billion for the first nine
months. The previous high for such transactions for a full year was
$1.6 billion in 1966. For the first nine months of 1968 the liquidity
deficit before special transactions was at an annual rate of $3-1/2
billion, compared to a $4.3 billion rate in the same period last year.
The seasonally adjusted liquidity deficit for the first nine
months of the year in its published version -- after taking credit for

IV -4
special transactions -- was at an annual rate of about $1-1/2 billion,
compared with a comparable annual rate of $2.4 billion in 1967.
Last year the published liquidity deficit in the fourth quarter
was extraordinarily large, partly because of the final liquidation
of $540 million of U.K. official investments in the U.S.
Measured on the official settlements basis there was a
surplus of perhaps $400 million in the third quarter, seasonally
adjusted. Special transactions have not significantly affected
this balance. Again, there is considerable uncertainty because
the September figures are incomplete and the seasonal adjustments
somewhat questionable. Of course, this balance has gyrated widely
during the year, registering very large surpluses in May and June
as U.S. banks absorbed via their foreign branches a substantial
part of the speculative drain on French and British reserves, coming
to near balance in July and August, and moving into a moderate
surplus again in September.
Favorable elements in the third quarter transactions
included some improvement in the trade balance (discussed below)
and probably also a considerable reduction in capital outflows for
direct foreign investment as well as a reduced accmumulation of
liquid funds abroad, as the proceeds of foreign borrowing were
increasingly substituted for funds from U.S. sources. Although
the reduction of U.S. banking claims on foreigners was interrupted
in August by a small net outflow, contrary to the usual seasonal
pattern, this reflected primarily large acceptance credits to
Brazil, while the general trend was still inward.

IV -5
As shown in the following table, the net inflow of foreign
private capital and short-term funds in the first half of this year
amounted to $5.3 billion (not seasonally adjusted), including $2.4
billion to acquire nonliquid assets and $2.9 billion of interbank
balances and deposits in U.S. commercial banks and other liquid
assets. These inflows had already reached major proportions in 1966
compared to prior periods. For example, in the six years 1960-65,
the average annual net inflow of private foreign capital was about
$900 million -- about one third for long-term investment and two-
thirds for liquid holdings in U.S. banks. But the 1968 inflow has
been more than double the 1966 rate.

These figures emphasize the extent to which these inflows
have been alleviating the recent balance of payments deficits --
expecially the official settlements balance which benefits from
the great increase in privately held foreign balances in U.S. banks
(but not from most of the "special" transactions excluded from this
tabulation). Sales to foreigners of securities to finance direct
foreign investments are a rather special case, in the sense that
the gain to the balance of payments has to be measured in terms of
the capital outflow that might otherwise be occurring -- as well as
future income derived from the investment of the funds. With a
mandatory control program in effect, the most direct gain from the
availability of offshore financing is the safety valve provided
for what would perhaps be intolerable pressures on the administration
of the restraints. Sales of these securities tapered off in the
third quarter to about $370 million from over $500 million in each
of the previous two quarters. A considerable number of companies
will probably borrow in the last months of the year to meet their
ceiling under the Commerce control program, but by the end of
September many major companies were well supplied with borrowed
funds, and whether they enter the market again will depend partly
on their anticipation of changes in borrowing costs in foreign
markets in 1969. U.S. companies will also be speculating on the
prospects for continuation of the control program under the same

IV -7
rules if the Administration changes. Early announcement of the
1969 program of the present Administration is planned so as to
minimize any precautionary outflow.
Foreign investments in U.S. corporate stocks slackened a
bit in August, but remained very high -- at about $100 million, net, --
by historic standards. The buildup of interbank balances and private
deposits in U.S. banks -- largely via the foreign branches of the
banks -- seems to have halted if not reversed (see page IV- above).
This year's inflows of foreign capital, both for investment purposes
and for more-or-less temporary lodging in commercial banks, have
been so far different in magnitude from previous experience that
expectations of their future course can only be conjectural.
U.S. foreign trade. The merchandise export surplus, very
slim in July, shrank further in August as a sharp rise in exports
was exceeded by an even greater rise in imports. The strong rise
in both exports and imports was attributed, in part, to anticipation
of an East Coast and Gulf Coast longshoremen's strike, which, in fact,
did begin on October 1 but was stopped by action under the Taft-
Hartley Act.
Port activity on the East Coast was reported to be
extremely heavy in September, particularly for outbound cargo,
suggesting that September exports may have been even greater than
August's. At the time of the last longshoremen's contract negotia-
tions, exactly 4 years ago in 1964, it was estimated that accelerated

IV -8
cargo movements from September through December, including the period
when a Taft-Hartley injunction was in effect, were twice as great
in exports, favorably affecting the export surplus then by close to a
$1/2 billion at an annual rate. This was followed, however, by a
much larger loss of net exports as a result of the 61-day work
stoppage that began in early January 1965.
For July-August combined, the export surplus (balance of
payments basis) was $0.7 billion at an annual rate, compared to
the $0.2 billion rate in the first half of the year.
Exports in July-August were at an annual rate of $33.9
billion (balance of payments basis), about 4-1/2 per cent higher
than in the first six months of 1968. Exports of nonagricultural
products were up nearly 6 per cent, continuing the expansion which
began before the end of 1967. Shipments of agricultural commodities
in July- August, although up from the preceding two months, were
nevertheless slightly below their average level in the first half
of the year. Exports of tabacco, ordinarily heavy in the autumn,
were advanced to August this year under the threat of the long-
shoremen's strike. Cotton shipments (in July) were also up,
reflecting late deliveries under contracts made earlier in the year.
By areas, the greatest gains in exports in July-August
continued to be in shipments to continental Western Europe,
particularly the EEC countries. Shipments to the U.K., Japan and
Latin America also expanded but more moderately, while exports to
Canada continued to slide.

IV -9
Imports in July-August held at the record second-quarter
annual rate of $33.2 billion (balance of payments basis). The
strong rise in August, following a drop in July, reflects in large
part extraordinarily heavy arrivals of steel ordered earlier, some
of which were delayed by the St. Lawrence Seaway strike (which ended
in mid-July). Larger receipts of unrefined copper, bonded for
refining and subsequent export, also contributed to the August rise.
Exceptionally large imports of whisky were related to the prospective
longshoremen's strike.
Arrivals of cars from Canada fell sharply in July and
declined further in August; they appeared to be much lower than
usual for a model changeover period. In contrast, imports of cars
from Europe and Japan continued strong in July-August, and were at
a rate nearly 20 per cent greater than in the second quarter. The
heavy inventory buildup in such cars was arrested in August but
the large stock liquidation which customarily occurs in that month
did not take place this year with imports higher than usual.
Purchases of other nonfood consumer goods also increased
in July-August, with both durable and nondurable types recording
sharp advances. The continued expansion in imports of foodstuffs
brought a further addition to coffee inventories.

IV -10
Economic activity in other industrial countries. Industrial
production in Western Europe, Japan, and Canada has continued to expand
in recent months. Demand forces in the United States and Germany have
been particularly influential in the current upswing, which began before
mid-1967. Though the pace of increase of U.S. import buying may now slow,
it is likely that domestic demand forces in Japan, France, and Italy, as
well as in Germany, will assume a larger role. Canadian activity, however,
is likely to keep more closely in step with U.S. demand.

The German economy at mid-1968 was nearing full employment, though
far from the extreme boom conditions of 1965 -- any repetition of which the
German authorities are determined to avoid. Following the sharp bulge in

IV -11
activity last December and the subsequent dip, expansion resumed in the
spring and summer. In August the unemployment rate fell below one per
cent and job vacancies were three-fourths again as large as the number
of unemployed, seasonally adjusted. Rather wide fluctuations in pro-
duction in the months of June and July resulted in part from efforts to
beat the midyear increase in the value-added tax. Averaging the two
months together, industrial production in June-July was 7 per cent above
the October-March average, and 16 per cent above the low second quarter
of 1967. According to a July survey, the rate of capacity utilization
during the summer was 86 per cent, a rate considered normal by most pro-
ducers though 3 points below the high capacity rates reached in 1965.
German exports in June-July were 11 per cent higher in value
than in the second quarter of 1967. Meanwhile imports had risen 18 per
cent, providing an important source of aggregate demand growth in neighbor-
ing economies. The narrowing of the German export surplus did not continue,
however, in May-July, when exports rose somewhat more than imports.
German authorities have again revised their forecasts for 1968
upward, and now predict a rise in real GNP of 5-1/2 per cent over 1967.
Demand has been expanding in all sectors of the economy: foreign orders
in June-July averaged 6 per cent more than in October-March; inventory
investment has continued at a higher rate than originally forecast;
private capital spending plans are being revised upward; demand from the
public sector remains strong; and private consumption, which earlier had
lagged, rose strongly during the spring.
Fiscal and monetary policies are continuing to favor balanced
expansion in Germany. The proposed 1969 budget seems calculated to put

IV -12
a mild brake on expansion; expenditures will increase by 5.4 per cent
over 1968 -- less than the anticipated growth of GNP in current prices --
and the budget deficit will be cut from $1.8 billion in 1968 to $0.9
billion in 1969. Monetary policy is no longer actively expansionary but
neither has the Bundesbank actively tightened credit. Market forces are
being allowed to exert their influence upon bank liquidity and in both
the first and second quarters this resulted in some withdrawal of bank
liquidity. In its latest (August) Monthly Report, the Bundesbank re-
affirms its view that there is still no reason to tighten monetary policy.
In Britain, economic activity has risen only moderately since
last winter, after a sharp expansion in the first quarter of this year.
In June-July industrial production was 1 per cent above the first quarter
level. The National Institute's August forecast, which assumed a con-
tinuation of moderate expansion, projected a 3.3 per cent annual rate of
increase in real GNP through the rest of 1968 and 1969.
The key factor of demand during the spring and summer was in-
ventory investment, reflecting replenishment of stocks depleted by the
consumer buying surge early in the year, as well as buying of materials
in anticipation of further export growth and of a pickup in fixed in-
vestment. The swing from an absolute rundown of inventories in the
first quarter to a rapid buildup in the second quarter was equivalent to
3 per cent of GNP. Inventory accumulation has probably been accentuated
by uncertainty over the permanence of the $2.40 parity, inflation fears,
and talk of import controls.
Personal consumpti n expenditures declined sharply last spring.
The real volume of retail sales (excluding autos) in April-July was

IV -13
almost 3.5 per cent below the first quarter. Automobile registrations
fell by about 40 per cent from the first to the second quarter.
Contributing to expansion of activity, British exports in
April-July averaged 9 per cent larger in volume (i.e. adjusted for price
changes) than in the six months October-March. The value of exports in
current prices jumped further by 5 per cent from July to August, and
it is likely that most of the increase was in real terms.
The government appears determined to keep a tight rein on con-
sumer spending and to slow the rate of increase in public sector spend-
ing. The government most recently reaffirmed its commitment to restraint
when it stressed that the lowering of the discount rate from 7-1/2 to
7 per cent on September 19 would not be accompanied by any easing of
restrictions on domestic credit. British consumer prices have been
rising more rapidly than wages since October 1967, in accordance with
the government's strategy for transferring resources out of consumption.
From March to June, prices rose by 2-1/4 per cent, wages about 3/4 of
one per cent.
Labor disputes thus far this year have involved numerous
small walkouts, especially in the auto industry, but no widespread
disruption of the economy comparable to the effects of the dock strike
a year ago. There is a possibility, however, that a strike that could
do incalculable damage to Britain's exports may begin next month. Negoti-
ations involving the 2.5 million manual workers in the engineering
industry have reached an impasse and the 31 unions involved are threaten-
ing a mass walkout starting October 21.

IV -14
Economic activity in France seems to have rebounded strongly
in July and August from the depressed levels of May and June. Because
of the nationwide strikes, industrial production in May was one-third
below the April level, and in June output was still 20 per cent below
April.
Average wage rates rose by about 10 per cent between April I
and July 1, to a level 15 per cent higher than a year earlier. Price
developments since the unrest have not been unsatisfactory; the consumer
price index rose at an annual rate of 4 per cent from April to July,
about the same pace as over the preceding 12 months. Larger increases
are expected during the rest of the year, but the Government is attempt-
ing to limit these through agreements with manufacturers. The expected
consumer boom is now under way. Retail sales at large stores and chains
in July and August were 10 per cent above their year-earlier level.
Surveys by INSEE and the Bank of France reveal very strong demand for
consumer appliances and automobiles.
In the first eight months, French exports were 10 per cent
higher than in January-August 1967. This rate of increase may accelerate
over the next few months as exporters take advantage of export subsidies
which will be reduced on November 1 and eliminated at the end of the year.
Imports in the first eight months were 7.5 per cent higher than in the
corresponding period last year, but it is expected that import demand
will increase strongly as a result of rising consumption.
Fiscal policy has moved in an expansionary direction, and the
1969 deficit is expected to be larger than this year's. Real GDP in 1969

IV -15
is expected to be 7 per cent above the 1968 average, making the two-year
average rate of growth from 1967 to 1969 about 5 per cent. But this rate
of growth will not be sufficient to absorb unused capacity in the economy,
and unemployment is expected to be a serious problem next year. The
government forecast is for price rises on the order of 4 per cent in 1969,
but this seems too optimistic to many observers, particularly in view of
the further wage increases at mid-1969 that have been promised. The govern-
ment also expects a sizable current account balance of payments deficit.
The Bank of France has been restricting its accommodation to
the market and maintaining unusually high interest rates, in order to
check the speculation against the franc. The latest 3-month Treasury bill
offering carried an interest rate of 7.75 per cent, almost 3 percentage
points above the April level.
Economic growth in Italy has not proceeded quite as rapidly as
had been forecast. Industrial production in the second quarter had risen
at an 8 per cent annual rate from the fourth quarter of 1967 (following
a rapid recovery after the mid-1967 pause). Aggregate demand was stimu-
lated by sharply higher exports, while domestic demand was relatively
sluggish. In particular, it appears from business surveys that producers
were trying to reduce excessive inventories.
As the Italian economy had been expanding less rapidly than its
potential, the Government, in late July, adopted a number of measures
intended to provide further stimulus to aggregate demand. The more im-
portant of these measures are an investment tax credit and a labor-cost
subsidy for firms in Southern Italy.

IV -16
Economic activity in the Netherlands continued to advance in
the second quarter, with exports a leading expansionary factor. Exports
of both the Netherlands and Belgium were adversely affected by the
troubles in France, but second-quarter output in Belgium was nevertheless
substantially larger than at any time last year.
Economic growth in Sweden has been slow in 1968, with industrial
production showing a year-to-year gain of only 2 per cent in the second
quarter. The official forecast (in May) envisaged a 5.5 per cent in-
crease in industrial production for 1968 as a whole over 1967, but it now
looks as though this rate will not be achieved.
Japanese industrial production has again been advancing rapidly,
following a moderate slackening in the first quarter. In July, as in the
second quarter, output was running 19 per cent higher than a year earlier.
Final demands, particularly for private consumption and for equipment in-
vestment, have been strong. Inventory investment diminished in the second
quarter, when there was an absolute decline in stocks of raw materials and
less rise in manufacturers' finished product inventories than there had
been in each of the three preceding quarters.
The slackening of growth earlier this year had been due mainly
to the tight money measures initiated in mid-1967 and strengthened in
early January. A major factor in the resumption of rapid growth in the
spring was the strong demand for Japanese exports, especially in the
United States. Also, with imports level during the first half, Japan's
balance of payments improved and permitted some easing of monetary policy.
After a period of virtually no expansion in the second half of
1967, the Canadian economy experienced moderate growth in the first half

IV -17
of 1968. Real gross domestic product in the second quarter was about
2.3 per cent higher than in the last quarter of 1967 -- an increase at
about a 4-1/2 per cent annual rate. The economy continued to be plagued,
however, by uncomfortably high rates of unemployment on the one hand and
price rises on the other. As a result of unusually rapid labor force
growth, the unemployment rate increased steadily in the first half and
reached 5.1 per cent in August, compared to 4.0 per cent a year earlier.
The consumer price index in August was 3.4 per cent higher than a year
earlier.
In Canada, as in Italy and Japan, exports were the leading factor
in demand expansion. For the January-August period exports were 17 per
cent higher than a year ago, despite a sharp decline in exports of wheat.
The increase in exports was accounted for nearly entirely by a 26 per cent
increase in sales to the U.S. A drop in U.S. imports in the coming months
as a result of the widely expected slowdown in the U.S. economy would have
marked short-run effects on the Canadian economy as there is little prospect
of significant expansion in other expenditure sectors, except for strong
growth in housing outlays.
Since the easing of the Canadian dollar crisis in the second
quarter, interest rates have fallen markedly. Long term government bond
rates have fallen by about 1/2 per cent and Treasury bill rates by about
1-1/2 per cent. The money supply began to increase rapidly in April, and
by early September was 13.5 per cent above a year ago.

APPENDIX A: SUMMER REVIEW OF THE FEDERAL BUDGET*
The Budget Bureau in the Summer Budget Review released on
September 12 made the following summary adjustments in its view of the
likely budget outcome for fiscal 1969.
FISCAL YEAR
(BillionsBUDGET TOTALS
of dollars)
Fiscal 1969Fiscal 1968 Fiscal 1969Jan. est. Summer review

Total outlays 178.9 186.1 184.4
Total receipts 153.5 178.1 179.4
Deficit 25.4 8.0 5.0
While the Summer Review revises the estimate of fiscal year
receipts upward by $1.3 billion--to take account of tax legislation
which shifted some revenues from fiscal 1968 to fiscal 1969, its major
focus is on adjustments in spending. For the most part these reflect
the spending constraints introduced by the Revenue and Expenditure
Control Act, passed in late June. Allowance has also had to be made,
however, for sizeable increases beyond January forecasts in crop
purchases by the Commodity Credit Corporation and in public assistance
grants, chiefly payments for Medicaid.
Despite the $6 billion spending cut required by the new law,
estimated budget outlays for fiscal 1969 have been reduced by only
$1.7 billion from the January forecast. The failure to produce a more
significant cut reflects increases beyond January forecasts in the
four key programs exempted from the act's expenditure ceiling. The
net effect of these diverse adjustments in the overall spending fore-
cast is shown in the table.

It is difficult at this point to evaluate the overall reason-
ableness of these summary estimates on changes in spending. Special
question has already been raised by some analysts regarding the reason-
ableness of the $2.3 billion increase projected for Vietnam support
operations. Two leading indicators of defense spending, obligations
and contract awards, suggest that without a sharp near-term reduction
in defense contracting, total defense spending for fiscal 1969 is
likely to be $80 billion. This would be $2.5 billion more than
projected in the Summer Review, and hence would raise the estimate
of change in Vietnam support spending to $4.8 billion.
Since the Summer Budget Review was released, Budget Director
Zwick has also indicated that CCC spending is now expected to exceed
the January forecast by $900 million rather than the $700 million
shown in the preceding table. At the same time, however, the Senate
has voted to add CCC spending to programs exempted from the spending
cut--presumably because such outlays reflect legislative provisions
and are not subject to executive discretion. The Senate has also
voted to cut spending for Medicaid by $500 million. In effect, this

A-3
decision would disallow all of the estimated increase in spending for
this program, forcing the states to cover the resultant shortfall in
funds or cut back the size of payments. It is not yet clear whether
the House of Representatives will go along with these Senate changes,
particularly with regard to the Medicaid program where complaints from
the states have already been voluble. If the Senate changes are not
accepted, however, the required cut-back of Federal spending in all
non-exempted programs would be $7.4 billion--the $6 billion originally
legislated, plus the $1.2 billion of added CCC and Medicaid spending,
shown in the Summer Review, plus the $200 million of further CCC outlays
recently projected by Mr. Zwick.
The exact allocation of these spending cuts has not been fully
determined, since several pending appropriations bills have yet to
receive final Congressional approval. But for planning purposes, the
Summer Budget Review assumes that Congressional and Administration cuts
together will be distributed about as follows:
EXPECTED DISTRIBUTION OF STATUTORY SPENDING CUT
Progrm Amount of Reduction
rogram(In billions)
Defense other than Vietnam support $3.0
Lending programs 1.2
Other programs 3.2
Agriculture 0.9
Non-exempted HEW programs 0.5/
Interior 0.4-
Transportation 0.3
NASA 0.3
Foreign aid 0.2
All other 0.6
Total 7.4
1/ Reflects in part an increase in the estimate of returns from mineral
leases on the Continental Shelf. Such returns appear in the budget
as a negative expenditure.
As the table shows, a key part of the projected spending cut
has been allocated to various lending programs. A third of a billion
dollars will be cut from the Export-Import Bank's net lending because
many new loans will be financed by selling seasoned portfolio loans to
private investors. The Small Business Administration will substitute
guaranteed bank loans for direct lending to reduce its outlays on the

A -4
budget accounts. And the Farm Credit Administration is expected
to cut back its lending program to 10 per cent of the fiscal 1968
total, partly because CCC payments have lowered the need for such
lending. Loans made by the Federal National Mortgage Association
will not be included in the federal accounts after it "gces private"
on October 1, three months earlier than anticipated in the January
budget documents; but since FNMA has been making more loans than
projected in January, these two unanticipated influences are about
offsetting and will have little budget impact.
While Congress is in session, the size and effective scope
of the mandatory budget cut could, of course, change further, thereby
causing corresponding shifts in the Administration's plans. The
foregoing represent the most likely assignments for spending cuts
