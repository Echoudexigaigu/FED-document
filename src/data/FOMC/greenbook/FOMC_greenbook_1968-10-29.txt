of Governors of the Federal Reserve Syst em.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization proce ss which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain. 
 Please note that some material may have b een redacted from this document if that

format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to rem ove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing). 
 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optical character recognition computer program (OCR) 
first created electronic text from the document im age.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, 
staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.  Pl ease note that the numbers and text in charts and

I -
SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK
Outlook for economic activity
The imminence of major events which could modify the economic
outlook--the election, the status of peace negotiations--makes short-term
forecasting particularly hazardous at the moment. As a best guess at
this time, the staff expects growth in economic activity to moderate some-
what further in the current (fourth) quarter. The rate of growth of
real GNP in the current period is now expected to dip to about 3-1/2 per
cent, as compared to the 5 per cent increase shown by preliminary data
for the third quarter. On the other hand, the rate of price increases
as measured by the GNP deflator (excluding Federal) is expected to rise
again following a surprisingly large deceleration in July-September which
was partly the result of special circumstances.
Gains in consumer expenditures are not likely to be as large in
the fourth quarter as in the third. Auto sales remain strong, but are
unlikely to show further growth of the kind that provided such buoyancy
in the third quarter. Other sectors of consumer buying after rising
briskly in July and August, have apparently shown little further in-
crease since that time.
The rise in business fixed investment in the third quarter re-
flected in part special factors and fourth quarter outlays should be
about in line with the small increase suggested by the Commerce-SEC

will be distributed to the Committee October 25 along with the
Greenbook Supplement.

I- 2
survey. Although the recent exemption of CCC and Medicaid from spending
curbs will lift fiscal year expenditures, only a modest further rise in
Federal outlays is expected in the fourth quarter.
Residential construction expenditures should show a larger
rise this quarter in light of the rapid revival in housing starts over
the summer.
Outlook for prices and resource use
The sharp decline in steel output appears to be over and, with
auto production scheduled at a new high for the year, industrial pro-
duction now appears to be moving up again at a slow pace. The production
decline in August and September brought the rate of manufacturing
capacity utilization down from 85 per cent in June to about 82.5 per
cent in September, and only a little recovery is in prospect for the
remainder of the year. Accompanying the drop in production, manufac-
turing employment has been showing little change. Altogether, the rise
in nonagricultural employment is expected to slacken somewhat in the
current quarter and the unemployment rate is expected to rise slowly
from the low September rate of 3.6 per cent.
Among the unexpected developments in the third quarter was a
large drop in the rate of increase in the GNP deflator for consumption
while consumption expenditures spurted sharply. This price development
reflected in part a substantial slowing in the rise of average prices
of nondurable goods when food prices stabilized (a supply development)
following a sharp advance over the preceding 6 months. In part, also

I-3
it reflected slackening in the earlier rapid advance in service prices.
New car prices were about unchanged despite the bulge in sales, and this
acted to moderate the over-all consumer price rise. This month and next
new car prices will be up moderately with the shift to new models. The
rise in average prices of nondurable goods will probably continue. Over-
all, the GNP deflator for the private economy is likely to accelerate
although to a pace below that of the first half of the year.
Continued strong upward pressures on wage rates, along with
hope for renewed expansion in industrial demands following an unusually
prompt run-off in excessive steel inventories, has contributed to the
step-up in industrial prices since mid-August. However, by early next
year, some easing of upward wage pressures is expected to begin. Along
with the slowing anticipated for consumer (and other) demands, this may
lead to reduction in the rate of increase in prices of industrial com-
modities--at retail and wholesale--and also may contribute to further
slackening of the still rapid upward movement in service prices.
Outlook for credit demands
The course of interest rates between now and year-end may be
as much, or more, influenced by expectational factors as by credit de-
manded and supplied. Demand factors themselves might exert some, but
probably not substantial, upward pressure on long-term interest rates
between now and year-end. The corporate bond market is currently in
an improved technical position; inventories of corporate underwriters
have been reduced, and the fairly moderate external financing needs of

I -4
corporations should tend to keep the volume of publicly offered new
issues below the $1 billion per month pace. In the tax-exempt market,
however, the volume of offerings is expected to continue large.
As of this writing, the specifications of the Treasury mid-
November refunding (to be announced Wednesday, October 23) are still
unknown. It is unlikely that the financing will result in any substan-
tial amount of intermediate-term securities being pressed on the market,
and thus may not exert very much direct pressure on the neighboring long-
term market. But the refunding, together with tax bills offered in late
November or early December, could tend to sustain upward pressures on
interest rates in shorter-term market sectors, though the extent would
depend on whether the financing is a cash or rights offering. Any
significant further rise in short-term rates could lead to higher long-
term rates through effects on dealer financing costs and on expectations
about monetary policy intentions.
Business demands for short-term credit from banks and in the
commercial paper market are likely to be a marginal factor exerting up-
ward pressure, at least of seasonal proportions, on the interest rate
structure. Demands for business loans from banks have accelerated some-
what recently. With inventory accumulation in the fourth quarter ex-
pected to be fairly sizable, business loan demands on banks may continue
at near their recent pace. Borrowings in the commercial paper market,
where costs currently are relatively attractive, are expected to con-
tinue to rise.

I -5
Outlook for supply of funds
Assuming no change in monetary policy, the supply of funds to
the credit market through financial institutions is unlikely to grow more
rapidly than in recent months. Interest rates sustained above their
summer lows, and a continued reduced rate of personal savings, should
serve to keep net inflows of funds into time and savings accounts at
banks and thrift institutions, taken together, at a moderate pace.
Growth in time and savings deposits of banks has slowed some-
what in the past two months. There has been a sharp reduction in the
rate at which banks have added to outstanding CD's once they had been
rebuilt to earlier peak levels following the tax increase, accompanied
by a partly offsetting acceleration in inflows of consumer-type time
deposits. Meanwhile, net savings inflows to nonbank savings institutions
have not shown any significantly greater expansionary tendency since the
tax increase.
The continued modest pace of savings inflows to thrift insti-
tutions makes it unlikely that much further improvement can be expected
in the rate of new mortgage commitments. Outstanding mortgage commit-
ments, and expected takedowns, are already relatively large, as thrift
institutions appear to have anticipated a somewhat better inflow of
funds.
With little prospect in the near term for any further improve-
ment in the supply of funds going into mortgages, and with mortgage de-
mands remaining large, a further decline in home mortgage yields is
unlikely, and some rise could develop. The rise in yields on alternative

I-6
bond market instruments during recent weeks has erased part of the previous
improvement in relative attractiveness of mortgage investments. And unless
there is a shift in the prevailing view that stocks are a better bet than
bonds over the long run, prospects are that institutional and individual
investors' buying patterns will tend to keep yields on debt instruments
relatively high.
Balance of payments
During the fourth quarter of 1968, the liquidity deficit before
special transactions is likely not to differ much from the average $3-1/2
billion annual rate recorded during the first nine months of the year,
and to be somewhat above the $2-1/2 billion rate (preliminary) for the
third quarter. An expected modest improvement in the trade balance seems
likely to be offset by a shift toward less favorable flows of private
U.S. and foreign nonliquid capital.
A deficit of $3-1/2 billion for the year 1968 would represent
some improvement compared with the record 1967 deficit of $4.8 billion
before special transactions, but would be larger than in any other year
since 1960. The strong upsurge of merchandise imports since 1965 has
had an impact on the trade balance that is proving very difficult to re-
verse, and the deficit has been held to its present level only by means
of large inflows of foreign equity capital (into U.S. stocks) and con-
trols over outflows of U.S. capital.
Reappraisal of the outlook for 1969, in the light of the
recent greater-than-expected strength in the U.S. economy, still leads

I-7
to the conclusion that the liquidity deficit before special transactions
will probably diminish somewhat further next year, but will remain large
enough to constitute a serious policy problem.
The published liquidity deficit, which is being held below
$1-1/2 billion this year thanks to very large receipts from special
official transactions, will probably increase next year as the scope for
new special transactions narrows. The balance on the official settle-
ments basis, which was in surplus during the spring and summer of 1968
when inflows of private foreign liquid funds were large, appears to
have reverted to deficit in October and is likely to show a deficit
next year.

THE ECONOMIC PICTURE IN DETAIL
The Nonfinancial Scene
Gross national product. According to preliminary official
estimates, the GNP rose at a rate of $18 billion last quarter, much more
vigorously than we had anticipated earlier on the basis of fiscal and
monetary restraints. The rate of expansion in real GNP was close to 5
per cent, down only moderately from the over 6 per cent rate in the
first half. The official figures also show a pronounced slowing in the
rate of price increase, as indicated by the GNP deflator, from a 4.0
per cent annual rate in the second quarter to 2.9 per cent in the third
quarter (excluding the effect of the Federal pay raise).
The official figures for the third quarter differ from our
last projections in several major respects: consumer expenditures, in-
ventory accumulation, and plant and equipment outlays were larger and,
paradoxically, the rate of price advance was slower.
Some of the discrepancies between the official estimates and
our recent projections are puzzling. For example, the vigor of retail
sales and the leveling off in industrial production in the third quarter,
and an anticipated run-off in steel stocks would have suggested that our
estimate of the inventory buildup was too large rather than too small.
Since the inventory estimate included in the preliminary official GNP
estimate is based on only two months' data, it may be that September
data and subsequent revisions will cast a different light on the picture.

II -2
Similarly, the marked slowing shown in the consumer price com-
ponent of the GNP rise is puzzling. Some of the factors involved are
discussed in the price section later. Our evaluation is that the slow-
ing which occurred is partly attributable to special factors, and that
a somewhat faster rise will be resumed this quarter.
There is less reason to be skeptical of the figures showing a
strong rise in personal consumption expenditures. Retail sales jumped
in July, edged up further in August and held at that advanced level in
September. While our earlier estimates had been premised on the assump-
tion that consumers would adjust initially to the tax increase by dipping
into the very high savings stream, that adjustment was larger than ex-
pected. The decline in the saving rate was 1.3 points (from a revised
second quarter rate) to 6.2 per cent. In addition--because of a higher
rate of inventory accumulation, the rise in fixed investment, and the
multiplier effects of buoyant consumer buying--the flow of disposable
income was better maintained than we had expected earlier.
Because of the unexpected strength of final demand last quarter
we have increased our fourth quarter estimate of the rise in GNP to $15
billion, still moderately below the third quarter increase. Growth in
real GNP is expected to fall from an annual rate of 5 per cent to a
rate of 3-1/2 per cent.
Gains in business investment and Government spending are both
expected to slow somewhat in this quarter, and although residential out-
lays will rise substantially, the major source of further expansion is
likely to be consumption expenditures. The rise in consumer spending

II -3
last quarter would have been unusually large even without the effects
of the surcharge, which reduced the expansion in disposable income to
about a $6 billion annual rate--about half the rise in the preceding
quarter. But the dip in the rate of saving was also unusually sharp,
dropping the level well below those prevailing in the preceding two
years, partly as a result of near-record sales of automobiles.
The increase in consumption appears likely to be more modest
this quarter. There are two considerations which suggest that the saving
rate is not likely to continue downward in the fourth quarter. One is
that the flow of disposable income will rise again, and the second is
that a further rise in auto sales seems unlikely after the third quarter
spurt--in fact, some decline in unit sales if not in expenditures for
autos seems more likely. If durable goods sales level off, the saving
rate should also tend to stabilize, even if the generous further in-
crease in expenditures for nondurable goods and services we have
assumed occurs.
Consumer-type inventories are likely to be stock-piled at a
higher rate this quarter if sales rise more slowly than in the third
quarter. Our projected level of nonfarm inventory investment of $7.6
billion in the fourth quarter implies gross accumulation of $9.5 or
$10 billion, apart from the run-down of steel stocks.
Last quarter there was little change in expenditures for new
homes, reflecting in part the lower level of starts in the second
quarter. The current quarter should see a relatively sharp advance,

II -4
however, since the rate of starts rose by over 100,000 units to 1.55
million units last quarter. While some decline in starts might reason-
ably follow this spurt, we believe that housing demand will remain
strong and should sustain starts at a rate of 1.5 million or more for
the quarter.
Expenditures for new plant and equipment are expected to rise
by about one billion dollars this quarter following a rise of over $3
billion last quarter. However, one-half of the third quarter increase
reflected a recovery from a second quarter dip. Outlays for automobiles
for business use and for farm equipment were strong last quarter, add-
ing to the rise in fixed business investment previously forecast in the
survey of investment intentions. Fleet and other business sales of
autos will probably remain high in the current period.
In the Government sector, Federal spending responded somewhat
more promptly and drastically to the Budget cuts required by the Revenue
and Expenditure Control Act than we had thought likely. Both defense
and nondefense purchases leveled off following the Federal pay raise in
July, and, outside a jump of a half billion dollars in the nondefense
category as CCC purchases accelerate this quarter, little change is
expected.
Corporate profits before tax have been maintained near the
first quarter peak rate owing to the unexpectedly strong business
picture. With the continued strong rise in personal income, and the
surtax, Federal receipts rose at an annual rate of about $10 billion

II -5
last quarter and the deficit is estimated to have dropped very sharply--
from over $10 billion to $3.5 billion or possibly less. It should remain
close to this rate in the current period as both receipts and expenditures
increase moderately.
State and local government outlays are continuing to grow as
employment and wage rates continue a strong upward trend. However, a
slowing in the rise in Federal grants is expected to exert a drag on
State-local purchases in the current quarter.

Industrial production. Industrial production, following a 1.3
per cent decline from July to September, probably rose slightly in
October. Steel production, which was severely curtailed in August and
September and which was the major cause for the decline in the total
index, turned up in early October. Auto schedules for October indicate
a new high in output for the year. Under the impetus of the advanced
level of retail sales, production of some other consumer goods should be
maintained or increase moderately. Output of business equipment is
estimated to remain at about its present level. The decline in coal pro-
duction because of strikes may be about offset by increases in some
other nondurable materials.
In 1968, the total index, excluding steel, rose from January
to July at an annual rate of 4.6 per cent, followed by a leveling off
during August and September, as shown in the table.

On a quarterly average basis, the production index, again ex-
cluding steel, rose from the first quarter to the second quarter, and

II -9
again in the third quarter. As shown in the table below, the increase
from the first quarter to the third quarter was at an annual rate of 3.8
per cent. Gains in output in this period, while they were widespread
among consumer goods, were sparked by a 20 per cent increase in auto pro-
duction. Growth in output of consumer staples has been in line with its
long run trend, but the rates of increase in production of apparel and
home goods have been below their usual trends. Output of defense equip-
ment leveled off in the second quarter but rose substantially in the
third quarter. Production of business equipment, however, has edged
downward so far in 1968. In terms of their long-term growth rates, out-
put of durable materials excluding steel has been below its trend and
production of nondurable materials has been on its trend.

Capacity utilization. The rate of manufacturing capacity
utilization declined to 82.6 per cent in September from 83.1 per cent
in August. If manufacturing production increases somewhat in October
as now expected, the operating rate will show little change. At its
present level the utilization rate is more than 2 points below its
second quarter average, but about two-thirds of this decline was
accounted for by steel.
The industry pattern of operating rates remains about the
same as in other recent months. Utilization rates appear to be above
normal in the motor vehicle, rubber, petroleum, and aircraft industries.
Unused capacity exists for the production of most other manufacturing
products.

Retail sales. The total value of retail sales in September
showed no change from the high August level, according to the advance
release. Durable goods stores enjoyed a 2 per cent month-to-month gain,

II -11
while sales of nondurable goods declined 1 per cent. Over-the-year,
total sales in September were up about 8 per cent.
The latest Census release is the first to reflect a new sample
of retailers. According to these revised data, month-to-month increases
in sales were larger in May and June, but smaller in July, than had been
indicated by the old sample. The new figures, in contrast to the old,
show a sizable further increase in August, and sales from July through
September now average about 3 per cent above the second quarter. Re-
vised data for the entire sample overlap period beginning in August
1967 are not yet available.

Unit sales and stocks of autos. Sales of new domestic autos in
the first 20 days of October imply a seasonally adjusted annual rate for
the month of about 8.7 million units, well above the strike-reduced level
of 7.6 million units a year earlier and close to the high third quarter
rate. Stocks of new domestic autos changed little in this period and
represented a 48 days supply at the current sales rates, down from the
50 days average supply in the first 9 months of this year.

II -12
Consumer credit. The amount of consumer installment credit out-
standing continued to increase rapidly in September. Early reports from
commercial banks, however, suggest an increase at a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of only around $8 billion. While this rate would be well
above the average increase so far this year, it would represent a sizable
decline from August--when a combination of rapid new borrowing plus a
slower rate of repayments pushed the expansion of installment credit out-
standing to an all time record annual rate of over $10 billion.
Business inventories. Retail and wholesale inventories declined
nearly $400 million (book value) in August, while retail and wholesale
sales increased somewhat. The trade inventory cut-back partly offset the
large August rise in factory stocks, and for manufacturing and trade com-
bined the increase in stocks amounted to $650 million, about in line with
the third quarter GNP nonfarm inventory investment estimate.

Manufacturers' orders and shipments. New orders received by
durable goods manufacturers rose 3.2 per cent in September, back to the
peak reached at the end of last year. The rise shown for August has
been revised up somewhat, to 1.5 per cent.
The September rise reflected large gains in orders for
machinery and for all other major durable goods industries except air-
craft and shipbuilding, which were down sharply. Aircraft orders, which
had risen about 5 per cent in August, were off 26 per cent in September.
Shipments by durable goods manufacturers in September rose 4.4
per cent following a decline now shown at nearly 5 per cent for August
(after upward revisions of July and August figures). Shipments of all
producers, except electrical machinery, rose in September.
Unfilled orders of durable goods producers as a group were
about unchanged from August, despite a decline in the aircraft backlog
due to the sharp drop in new orders.
Residential construction and real estate. Seasonally adjusted
private housing starts--already unexpectedly high--rose in September to
a 1.6 million unit rate. This was a new peak for the year and brought
the average for the third quarter to 1.55 million, nearly 8 per cent
above the reduced second quarter average and 3 per cent higher than the
advanced rate in the first quarter. As a result, the average for all
three quarters reached 1.50 million, somewhat above the level for all
of 1965.

II -14
Unlike August, single family starts led the September increase,
but multifamily starts also moved higher to match the near-record high
reached last April. Regionally, the Northeast and West accounted for
almost all of the total rise.
Seasonally adjusted building permits, which were revised upward
by 4 per cent for August also increased in September, to the highest rate
since last March. The advance was mainly in multifamily units, however.
While the rate of total permits dropped by 10 per cent in the Northeast,
they rose in all other regions by amounts ranging from 9 per cent in the
South to 18 per cent in the North Central states.

Altogether, the third quarter starts performance was appre-
ciably stronger than could be expected from the rate of net savings
inflows realized so far this year by major lenders. Pent-up demands
accumulated over most of the past three years and general expectations
of further increases in construction costs and property values were,
of course, important factors in this development. But these factors
were already in operation earlier this year. Lender expectations of
improved availability of mortgage funds aroused by the fiscal package
which was finally passed last June has contributed to the upturn, as
has the apparent confirmation of easier mortgage market conditions
through most of the quarter. Of key importance, however, has been the
improved inter-regional flow of mortgage funds resulting from the
upward adjustment in usury ceiling rates, which were long-anticipated
and which culminated in early July. The major impact of this change
was concentrated in the Northeast states, and this region alone accounted
for as much as seven-tenths of the over-all expansion in the rate of
starts from the second to the third quarter of this year.
Sustaining the third quarter rate for an extended period
would seem to require further improvement in net savings inflows to
major lenders. Meanwhile, however, indications are that residential
builders have been helped both directly and indirectly by increased
reliance of the real estate market as a whole on equity financing and
other sources of funds outside regular mortgage market channels. (See
the section on mortgage market developments.) Moreover, lenders

II -16
apparently have based their willingness to make a large volume of com-
mitments on expectations that further improvements in funds-flows will
come in time to meet future take-downs, particularly for multifamily
structures, which have relatively long construction periods. Under
these circumstances, while some decline in starts after the unex-
pectedly sharp third quarter advance may develop, it may not be appre-
ciable. Thus, starts in the fourth quarter as a whole could hold
fairly near the advanced annual rate of 1.55 million units in the
third quarter.

II -17
Personal income. Reflecting advances in all types of income,
personal income rose by $4-1/2 billion in September to an annual rate
of $698-1/2 billion. Because of a slower rise in transfer payments and
dividends, the over-all advance was somewhat below those of July and
August.
Wage and salary income--which rose $3 billion to $471-3/4
billion--continued to increase at about the same rapid pace as in July
and August. Approximately half the September increase occurred in the
commodity-producing industries, where manufacturing posted an increase
of $3/4 of a billion after rising by less than half that amount in
August. Construction payrolls increased substantially for the first
time since February as a large number of workers returned to work after
extended strikes.
For the third quarter as a whole, wage and salary payments
averaged $468.6 billion at annual rates, up by $11 billion from the
second quarter. The rate of increase was up from the second quarter
in the government sector largely because of the Federal pay raise.

The rapid rate of increase in wage and salary payments
primarily reflects the strong uptrend in wage levels rather than sub-
stantial employment gains. Contractual wage increases have been very
high this year and, in the first half, compensation per manhour in the
private economy rose by over 7 per cent from a year earlier. Increases
in wage and salary rates accounted for an estimated two-thirds of the
over-all increase in gross wage and salary payments between the first
nine months of 1967 and the comparable period in 1968, while employment
increases accounted for about one-third. With the end of a major
bargaining round in typically high wage durable goods manufacturing,
and some anticipated easing in the demand for labor, the rate of increase
in gross wage and salary payments should ease somewhat in coming quarters.
Industrial relations. The heavy collective bargaining
schedule of 1968 involving close to 4 million workers has about reached
its end. Still outstanding is a settlement in the negotiations between
longshoremen and East and Gulf Coast shippers where an 80-day Taft-
Hartley injunction was obtained enjoining the union from a strike until
December 20. In the 1965 negotiations the union resumed their strike
for 33 days at the end of a similar injunction period before agreement
was reached on a new contract.
A contract settlement was reached October 14 between the
Bituminous Coal Operators and 80,000 miners ending wildcat strikes
which began October 1. The contract provided above average annual wage
increases but the fringe increases were relatively low, so that the

II -19
average annual increase in employment costs is estimated to be in line
with the 6 to 6-1/2 per cent average package increase negotiated this
year. The wage increase alone averaged 8 per cent over the life of the
contract compared with a 5 per cent average in other major contracts.
The first-year increase of 10 per cent in wages was also well above the
pattern of 7-1/2 per cent average increases in other major contract
settlements this year.
Fewer workers will be affected by wage reopenings next year
in collective bargaining agreements--about 2-3/4 million workers com-
pared to almost 4 million this year. Deferred wage increase, or increases
negotiated in contract settlements in 1968 or earlier years, will play
a much more important role. More than 5-1/2 million workers will
receive deferred increases in the 4 to 4-1/2 per cent range in 1969.
Labor market. Demands for labor continued relatively strong
as the economy entered the fourth quarter. The unemployment rate edged
up to 3.6 per cent in September, equal to its average thus far in 1968,
and continued near frictional levels for adult men (2.2 per cent).
Reflecting the firm employment picture through mid-October, insured
unemployment remained well below year-earlier levels as it has all year.
Despite the firm over-all picture, there were some signs of
easing in September. The rate of increase in nonmanufacturing employ-
ment appeared to be slowing from its July-August pace, manufacturing
employment showed a very small decline for the third consecutive month,
and labor force growth continued to lag, contributing to the maintenance
of low unemployment.

II -20
After making allowances for employment increases resulting
from reduced strike activity--mainly in construction--nonfarm payroll
employment rose by about 95,000 in September. As in other recent months,
the bulk of the increase was in the nonindustrial sector where employ-
ment was up 80,000 over the month. Employment gains were relatively
small in trade--where retail sales held steady over the month--and in
State and local government. Reflecting legislative restrictions on
replacement hiring, Federal Government employment dropped another 13,000
to a level nearly 60,000 below its June peak.
The pattern of more moderate employment growth represents a
continuation of the slower growth which emerged in the second quarter
of this year. Although the June-to-September increase in nonfarm
employment was nearly the same as in the previous three-month period,
the composition was appreciably different. Employment has been unusually
stable in manufacturing this summer, following a sharp gain between March
and June. Federal civilian employment has declined since June. In
contrast, trade, services, and State and local government employment
rose more rapidly from June-September than in the three previous months
and the downtrend in construction employment gave way to a moderate
increase.

The factory workweek bounced back up to 40.9 hours in
September--about the previous high for the year--after dipping sharply
in August. A late model changeover in autos dropped the workweek in
the transportation equipment group by nearly 1 hour in August, then
pushed it up by the same amount in September. In primary metals, where
the steel inventory adjustment problem has generated only modest lay-
offs, average weekly hours were down 2 full hours from the April peak.
Labor force growth continued at a sub-normal rate in September.
At 78.8 million, the work force was only slightly higher than 6 months
ago and was up only I million from a year earlier. This year-to-year
increase was about 400,000 short of the expected "normal" rise. The
pattern of slower growth--which reduces the competition for jobs and can
arise from any number of forces including easier labor demand--was not
concentrated in any particular age-sex group. The recent smaller
increases in the labor force have paralleled the more moderate employ-
ment advances of recent months and have been partially responsible for
the maintenance of low unemployment levels this summer.

Consumer prices. As pointed out in the October 2 Greenbook,
the rise in consumer prices slowed appreciably over the 3-month period
from May to August, after allowing for usual seasonal changes in retail
prices of commodities (especially foods) and after setting aside the
sharp spurt in mortgage interest charges as measured in the CPI. The
abrupt jump in mortgage interest between May and August was a special--
and presumably temporary--phenomenon of dubious relevance to the under-
lying course of "consumer prices"; it was not reflected in (GNP)
consumption expenditures nor in the implicit price deflator for con-
sumption expenditures.
Slowing of the rise in consumer prices during the summer
months has been confirmed by the preliminary (and confidential) OBE
estimates of the implicit deflator for consumption expenditures in the
third quarter. No additional CPI data have become available since the

II -23
last Greenbook; the CPI for September will be released early next week.
The deflator for consumption expenditures is, of course, based primarily
on the CPI.-/ The present third quarter deflator thus involves price
estimates for September.
Comparison of quarterly movements of the CPI and the PCE
deflators cannot be made accurately at aggregate levels because of
internal differences in weights, coverage, and (probably) seasonal
measurement. However, a rough comparison is provided in the table
below for the first three quarters of this year. In developing the
CPI figures shown in the upper tier of the table, a few major weight
and coverage adjustments have been made to partially adapt the CPI
changes to PCE concepts. (Changes in the regularly published CPI [not
seasonally adjusted] are shown--for comparison--as the first item in
the table.) The third quarter changes shown for the CPI--like those
for the PCE deflators--incorporate estimates for September.
1/ In the base year (1958) for the constant dollar GNP figures, two-
thirds of the individual components of aggregate consumption expen-
ditures were deflated by CPI series. Conversely, of course, it is
of interest that one-third of the PCE deflators were based on other
price series not included in the CPI.

The rise in consumer prices slackens much more abruptly in
the third quarter when measured by the implicit deflator for PCE than
by the CPI. This difference is concentrated to a large degree in the
durable goods sector, and it may relate partly to the spurt in auto
sales in the third quarter which was apparently accompanied by no
change in new car prices (as indicated by the BLS seasonally adjusted

II -25
series).- The third quarter decline in the rate of increase in
service prices was also more pronounced in the implicit PCE deflator
than in the CPI series. The downward shift in the rise in average
prices of nondurable goods in the third quarter reflected primarily
the near leveling off in food prices following the sharp rise over the
preceding 6 months.
1/ The implicit deflator incorporates current period weights (the
Paasche formula), whereas the CPI incorporates base period weights
(Laspeyre).

II -26
Wholesale prices. Final BLS data have confirmed the preliminary
estimate of an 0.3 per cent increase in wholesale prices of industrial
commodities in September (Confidential until release, probably October 29).
Average prices of farm products and processed foods and feeds also rose
as estimated--with a 29 per cent jump in egg prices accounting for over
2/3 of the increase--and the total wholesale price index was up 0.4 per
cent to 109.1 per cent of the 1957-59 average.
Increases for steel mill products and for lumber and plywood
were larger than estimated by the BLS a month ago, and these three
materials accounted for half of the rise in the industrial average.
The lumber and plywood price advances (coupled with sizable further
increases in prices of manmade fiber broadwoven goods and hides and
skin) resulted in a large further rise in the FR index of sensitive
industrial materials--to a level almost 1-1/2 per cent above the low
reached in June. Average prices of steel mill products increased 2.3
per cent, contributing to an abrupt, 0.4 per cent step-up in the FR
index of "other" (sluggish) materials, which had been stable for four
months. With the September advance, prices of steel mill products
have increased 4.7 per cent since mid-1967--more than over the preceding
6 years.
While steel and lumber-plywood were the major elements in
the renewed pick-up in industrial prices in September, prices of many
other items also rose. Altogether nine of the thirteen major sub-groups
of the BLS industrial commodity total showed increases, and among the

II -27
225 industrial product classes price increases were effected for 106--
or 47 per cent. The latter figure compares with this year's low of
39 per cent in July, when the BLS industrial average was unchanged, and
with the year's high of 58 per cent in February, when the industrial
index increased 0.5 per cent.
The bulk of the industrial price increases were for materials.
The special FR index for industrial products increased only 0.1 per cent;
average prices of producers' equipment (particularly machinery) rose
0.3 per cent--the largest rise since April--while prices of consumer
products remained unchanged for the third month. Price increases for
1969 model autos (averaging 1.2 per cent, as compared with 2 per cent
a year ago on 1968 models) will appear in the October index and will
act to raise both the producer and consumer product indexes.

Farm debt in mid-1968. Total debt of farm operators increased
9 per cent during fiscal 1967-68, to an estimated $53 billion on June 30,
1968. The percentage increase was the same as in the preceding year,
and a little less rapid than the average annual rise for the period
since 1963. Debt secured by farm real estate rose faster than non-real-
estate debt, the opposite of the growth pattern in fiscal 1966-67.
In fiscal 1967, expansion in farm real estate debt was
dampened by lender policies limiting loans for longer term purposes
and giving priority to loans for essential non-postponable financing
of productive farm operations. In fiscal 1968, and so far in fiscal
1969, lenders, because of direct and indirect effects of tight credit,
have continued to screen loans very carefully, but farmers may have
sought credit a little less aggressively because of discouraging
income prospects and high interest rates. Demand for non-real-estate
credit, although raised by a continued advance in operating costs have
probably been softened a little by cutbacks in 1968 acreages of some
crops and by larger direct payments to farmers associated with these
cutbacks.
Growth in non-real-estate debt owed by farmers to all the
major lenders was less in fiscal 1968 than in the preceding year. Loans
outstanding of the production credit associations and related livestock
associations showed the largest increase and loans of the Farmers Home
Administration, the least. Loans outstanding at commercial banks, the
largest lender of non-real-estate secured loans to farmers, increased
7 per cent.

II -29
Real estate secured loans outstanding increased 10 per cent
in fiscal 1968 with commercial banks and Federal land banks showing
increases of 15 and 13 per cent, respectively. Farmers Home Administra-
tion holdings of direct loans decreased 8 per cent. However, Farmers
Home Administration holdings of insured farm ownership and rural housing
loans increased 41 per cent, an aggregate increase of $750 million.
In fiscal 1968, the agency, under its authority to insure loans and to
make loans to be sold and insured, sold nearly a billion dollars worth
of insured loan paper directly to private investors, such as pension
funds and banks, and to brokers for resale. These insured loans are not
included in the debt totals shown in the table except for amounts held in
the farm real estate portfolios of commercial banks. Increased invest-
ment in Farmers Home Administration insured loans by commercial banks
during fiscal 1968 may account for some of the sharp rise in farm real
estate loans of banks shown in the table.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL SITUATION
Bank credit. Data for weekly reporting banks suggest that
expansion in total loans and investments remained substantial during
early October. Much of the increase appears to reflect further loan
expansion, with growth in business loans showing renewed strength. For
the entire month of October, bank credit--measured on a daily average
basis and adjusted to include changes in Euro-dollar borrowing--is
projected to increase at about an 11.0 per cent annual rate, or at
approximately the pace of September.
As in September, holdings of Government securities at large
banks have shown little change so far in October, after having increased
rapidly in July and August. The relatively large amount of Treasury
securities now held (together with the prospect of new issues in a late
October financing), and the continued strength in loan demand possibly
explain why banks have made no further acquisitions of Government
securities in recent weeks.
However, large banks did continue to add to their holdings
of municipals--both long and short-term--and agency issues in early
October, although at a rate somewhat reduced from the rapid pace of the
third quarter. All of the recent increase took place at banks outside
New York, while banks in New York liquidated small amounts of these
securities.
Following a slowdown in September, growth in business loans
at large banks appears to have picked up again in early October. Nearly

III -2
half of the rise was in retail trade, and may represent, in part,
increased bank borrowing by some automobile dealers following the expira-
tion of the temporary credit extended to dealers by automobile manu-
facturers during the model change-over period. Loans to services,
transportation equipment, wholesale trade, and construction industries
also rose more than normal, the latter probably associated with the
recent increase in housing starts.
Security loans expanded moderately further at large banks
during the first two weeks in October, as dealers continued to maintain
relatively high inventories. Consumer loans continued to expand at
about the increased pace of recent months, while growth in real estate
loans appears to have accelerated somewhat further.
Bank deposits. Time and savings deposits at all commercial
banks in October are projected to increase by an additional $2.5 billion,
on a daily average basis--slightly below the average monthly increase
over the third quarter--or at about a 15.5 per cent annual rate. At
large banks, inflows both of CD funds and of consumer-type time and
savings deposits remained relatively large early in the month.

Following a less-than-normal decline over the September tax
and dividend period, outstanding CD's at large banks rose rapidly
towards the end of the month and into early October as banks continued
to seek CD funds with which to meet sustained loan demand. However, in
order to attract the desired amount of these funds, large banks recently
have had to raise their offering rates slightly--to about the levels
prevailing prior to the reductions in the prime rate in late September.
About two-thirds of the recent rise in CD's took place at New York City
banks and may also reflect to some extent the increase in the cost of
Euro-dollars relative to that of CD's over the last few weeks. (Follow-
ing a $1.4 billion increase from the end of July through the September
tax date, bank liabilities to foreign branches fell about $700 million
over the three weeks ending October 9, although rising by $350 million
in the following week.)1,027

Inflows of consumer-type time and savings deposits at large
banks--after having shown a steadily increasing rate of growth in
recent months--rose rapidly during the first two weeks following the
interest-crediting period at the end of September. Savings deposits
increased sharply--primarily in the San Francisco district, which holds
approximately one-third of all savings deposits at large banks--probably
reflecting, in large part, quarterly crediting of interest to existing
deposits. Inflows of time certificates and open accounts were also much
larger than in recent months, and may represent some diversion of funds
from other savings outlets in response to the recently increased promo-
tional campaigns of banks.
After showing little net change since early July, the money
stock has risen fairly substantially since late September. This rise
in part reflected a sharp drop in U. S. Government deposits prior to
payment of the newly issued tax bills. In addition, the recent resur-
gence of stock market activity may have contributed to the build-up of
private money balances. During the first half of October the outstand-
ing money stock averaged 190.7 billion, up 5.8 per cent from a year ago,
and up 4.5 per cent (annual rate) from the June-July average.
Nonbank depositary intermediaries. Total net savings inflows
to nonbank depositary institutions were little different on balance in
the third quarter than earlier in the year. At savings and loan asso-
ciations, inflows improved in August and September from the July low
point, and the third quarter rate was fractionally higher than in the

III -5
first half of the year. While inflows at mutual savings banks also
have increased since July, deposit expansion for the third quarter as
a whole has been slower than in the past three quarters. However, as
indicated in the next section, both institutions have continued to
increase their outstanding mortgage commitments despite only modest
improvement in inflows.

Mortgage market developments. After the first week in
October, there were scattered indications that conditions, at least in
the secondary mortgage market, were beginning to tighten again, follow-
ing a period of gradual easing which had prevailed since mid-June. With
returns on other capital market instruments rising even faster, yields
on FNMA's forward purchase commitments of Government-underwritten home
mortgages edged higher in both the October 14 and 21 auctions, as shown
in the table, despite an increase in the volume of auction bids that
FNMA accepted.

was May 6.
In September and early October, in contrast, easing had
continued in the home mortgage market, even though savings experience
at the thrift institutions improved only moderately during September.
Last month, yields on certain FHA-insured home mortgages traded in the
secondary market declined for the third consecutive time. And a number
of savings and loan associations on the West Coast started the fourth
quarter by cutting their prime mortgage lending rates by 1/4 of 1 per
cent or more.
Although interest rates on conventional new-home mortgages
again edged down in 3 out of 6 major geographic regions during September,
they rose slightly in the Northeast where adjustments to earlier usury-

III -8
ceiling increases were continuing. Thus the national average for
these conventional loans remained unchanged at a record 7.30 per cent,
as shown in the table. This was some 65 basis points above a year
earlier and 150 basis points above the 1963-65 plateau.

Note: FHA series: Interest rates on conventional first mortgages
excluding additional fees and charges) are rounded to the near-
est 5 basis points. Secondary market yields and discounts are
for certain 6 per cent, FHA-insured Sec. 203 loans through
April 1968. Data for May 1968 estimated by Federal Reserve
based on the new 6-3/4 per cent regulatory rate, on which a
change of 1.0 points in discount is associated with a change of
12 to 13 basis points in yield. Gross yield spread is average
mortgage return, before deducting servicing fees, minus average
yield on new issues of high grade corporate bonds.

III -9
Since returns on new issues of high-grade corporate bonds
also changed little during September as a whole, the gross yield spread
favoring investment in conventional or Government-underwritten home
mortgages continued at around 100 basis points. Although this margin
was still well below earlier highs, it was the widest in more than a
year. With corporate bond yields rising markedly in October, however,
the yield spread favoring mortgages probably became much less attractive.
As lenders sought to lock up the record or near-record
mortgage yields prevailing in September, credit availability improved
sharply in the residential mortgage market, according to FHA and FNMA
field reports, apparently reflecting expectations of more positive
improvements in lender cash flows than have yet appeared. By the end
of the month, local supplies of mortgage funds were reported to be
adequate to meet demands for long-term credit in nearly all major areas.
Such credit demands, according to FNMA field reports, generally con-
tinued strong in the face of high credit costs, in part because some
borrowers were said to be anxious to buy now as a hedge against expected
further increases in house prices.
Reflecting these supply and demand pressures, the mortgage
commitment backlog at all savings and loan associations and at New York
State mutual savings banks rose in September for the third consecutive
month, after allowance for seasonal variation. By month-end, the aggre-
gate dollar volume of the commitment backlog available for future take-
down at these thrift institutions was 7 per cent above mid-year and 12
per cent above a year earlier.

III -10
During the third quarter as a whole, mortgage holdings of
all lenders expanded at a rate that was little changed from the first-
half pace, according to tentative Federal Reserve estimates. The net
expansion in all types of mortgage credit outstanding--at a seasonally
adjusted annual rate approximating $25 billion--thus continued well
above the average for the first three quarters of 1967 but somewhat
below last year's fourth-quarter high reached when recovery from the
late-1966 low was still underway. As might be expected from the high
mortgage interest rates now prevailing, a larger than usual share of
total credit extensions this year has apparently been concentrated in
financing real market activity. Thus loans closed through September
1968 by insured savings and loan associations for refinancing purposes--
rather than for construction or purchase--have declined both relatively
and absolutely below their year-earlier volume.
There has also been greater reliance this year on financing
techniques which by-pass the use of additional high-cost mortgage credit
altogether. In the residential mortgage market, used-home buyers have
apparently been increasing their assumption of existing mortgages bear-
ing interest rates considerably below those currently available on newly-
made mortgages. For multifamily and other income properties, direct
real estate investment by life insurance companies has been stepped up
further through August, although not by enough to offset a continued
year-over-year decline in the amount by which these institutions have
been expanding their mortgage portfolios.

III -11
Life insurance policy loans. Net increases in policy loans
abated somewhat during September but nevertheless continued at the high
rate begun early this year. Altogether, the cumulative net increase
during the first three quarters of 1968 nearly matched the high reached
in the comparable period of 1966.

According to another sample, policy loan increases in the
second quarter absorbed 10 per cent of total investable funds--a high
exceeded only by the 16 per cent in the second half of 1966. Eleven
of the 34 companies sampled reported that policy loans accounted for
over 20 per cent of their total investment funds, and 2 of these reported
that more than 50 per cent of these funds were absorbed by policy loans.
Only once, during the latter part of 1966, have more companies reported
a comparable volume of such loans.

III -12
Unlike 1966, the industry had anticipated this development
in view of the outlook for continued high cost of other credit sources
and the increased consumer awareness of this source that resulted from
the 1966 experience. Thus, in contrast to 1966, insurance companies
planned much more leeway in relating commitment takedowns to expected
cash flows; as a result, there have been no reports of commitment take-
downs being re-scheduled because of policy loan pressures. Although
information about current policy loan borrowers is limited, activity is
reported to be concentrated in small loans; in 1966, evidence suggested
that relatively large business loans were made because of the reduced
availability of commercial bank credit.
Corporate and municipal bond markets. Yields on corporate
and municipal bonds advanced sharply during the first half of October
as market sentiment deteriorated amid a continuing flow of bullish
economic comment and data at a time when there was a substantial volume
of new issues concentrated in a short period of time. Following the
upward drift of previous weeks, the early October developments have
erased in both markets about two-thirds of the yield decline following
passage of the surtax. Early in the week of October 18, however, the
rumors of new developments on the Vietnam peace front produced a turn-
around in the capital markets. These rumors dominated the views of
market participants--apparently offsetting completely the publication
of the unexpectedly large third quarter GNP estimate--and underwriters
priced new issues at lower yields as investors snapped up older offerings.

III -13
Within 48 hours, yields on comparable issues declined about 10 basis
points, hence producing an essentially unchanged average level of
yields for the last week shown on the table, despite the continued up-
ward momentum of yields in the early part of that week.

The estimated October volume of corporate bond offerings in
the public market has been raised $150 million to $1 billion. This
increased volume does not appear to indicate a new surge of corporate
bond flotations, but rather represents the addition to the calendar of
a significant number of relatively small issues whose timing was pre-
viously listed as indefinite. Given the wide swing in yields over the
past few weeks, however, some borrowers may reevaluate their planned

III -14
timing of financing, with the resultant possibility that the final
October volume may be less than $1 billion. As a partial offset to the
increased public volume, estimated takedowns of private placements in
October have been reduced to $500 million--$200 million below the sea-
sonally higher September. The latest data continues to show a generally
weak pattern of private placement takedowns with no pick-up from earlier
months this year. Total corporate security offerings in October--
including bonds and stock--are estimated at about $1.8 billion, little
changed from the third quarter monthly average.

Corporate public bond offerings currently scheduled for
November total about $600 million, with the ultimate volume estimated
at about $850 million. While this places November $150 million below
October, volume continues at a relatively strong pace largely due to a

III -15
heavy calendar of public utility issues. The estimated decline in
total security offerings in November--to $1.6 billion--reflects the
drop-off in public bond issues and a slightly lower volume of stock
offerings.
In the municipal market, expected new issues in October have
ballooned to a record $2.0 billion--$.3 billion above the previous high
set in August. Accounting for the bulk of this outsized volume is the
coincidental issuance of bonds by several large borrowers--such as
New York City, State of California, New Jersey Turnpike Authority, and
Maryland State Roads Commission. Additionally, the October borrowings
include about $300 million of industrial revenue bonds and $100 million
of accelerated California school district issues. The California case
represents an attempt to market bonds prior to the November elections
since a proposition on the ballot would, if passed, severely restrict
future borrowing authority.

Municipal offerings in November are expected to aggregate
about $1.6 billion, substantially below October but still unusually
high. In this month also, several large borrowers have scheduled offer-
ings and industrial revenue issues are likely to be sizable.- Due to
the frequent rescheduling of issues in a congested and unstable market,
the November estimate should be viewed as highly tentative at this date.
But the necessitous nature of the revenue bond issuers and the large
number of other potential borrowers would suggest that municipal offer-
ings are not likely to show any substantial moderation over the near
term, even if unfavorable market conditions persist.
Stock market. The advance in common stock prices, which
began in early August, was sustained in October, with trading volume
at near-record levels. Continued back-office difficulties associated
with the increased trading volume led the Exchanges to extend the 4-day
trading week at least through the end of the month.
1/ The previously reported amendment raising the size of industrial
revenue issues exempted from Federal income taxes after the first
of the year from $1 million to $5 million has now been signed into
law. Despite this amendment, the volume of such financing will
still decline sharply after January 1.

The rise in prices has been broadly based and, as indicated
in the table above, most pronounced among seasoned issues such as those
represented by the Dow-Jones Industrial Average. The continuing flow
of information implying a vigorous economy and, more recently, the new
rumors of progress in the Vietnam negotiations have apparently been the
prime stimulants to the broad advance.

III -18
Institutions--the major cash customers in the stock market--
were apparently responsible for a significant portion of the recent
increase in stock prices; certainly margin customers were not. In
September the margin debt of brokers' customers declined $70 million
(preliminary)--the third decline in as many months.-/ Purpose loans to
nonbrokers at weekly reporting banks rose again in September, this time
by $27 million, but the significance of the increase is clouded by the
fact that this figure includes loans on bonds as well as OTC stocks.
Despite the sharp increase in stock prices, the large proportion of
customers whose accounts were in restricted status limited the increase
in special miscellaneous balances at brokers to $30 million, or 0.5 per
cent.
U. S. Government securities market. After a very brief
downward adjustment immediately following the last Committee meeting,

declined in each of the last three months, by a total of 4.5 per
cent.

Aside from recent shifts in Vietnam prospects, two factors
have been primarily responsible for movements in yields in the Govern-
ments market during October. First, there has been a growing concern
in the market--a concern heightened by continued buoyant business news
and relatively high money rates--that System operations may be leaning
in the direction of firmer monetary conditions. Secondly, upward
pressures on short-term rates have tended to produce sympathetic yield
movements in longer Government issues, which have been intensified by
yield increases in the corporate and municipal markets in the process
of marketing the relatively large volume of recent new issues.
Dealers' positions in both bill and coupon issues have
declined somewhat in the last three weeks, continuing the general trend
begun in late September, but their holdings still remain moderately

III -20
large. This is particularly true for coupon issues in the over 5-year
area, where progress in reducing positions in 5- to 10-year maturities
has been fairly steady, but in small steps. Nonetheless, in an environ-
ment characterized by relatively high day-to-day financing costs and
uncertainty about the extent and form of the Treasury's near-term
financing plans dealers have continued to express some nervousness about
their positions.
A good deal of the market's pessimism was offset by the
Vietnam de-escalation rumors, and rates moved down accordingly. In
particular, the Treasury's recent $3 billion tax bill offering was bid
for considerably more aggressively than might otherwise have been the
case. Selling of the bills by banks in the secondary market has
reportedly been fairly slow since the auction. Even so, in the most
recent weekly Treasury bill auction, dealer interest was not strong,
and the 3-month bill was issued at an average rate of 5.40 per cent,
and stopped out at 5.45 per cent.
Several other short-term rates--including CD offering rates
and bankers' acceptances--have also moved up since the October 8 meeting
of the Committee.

Federal finance. The fourth quarter outlook for Federal
finance is more than usually uncertain. Growth in the level of spend-
ing slackened considerably in the third quarter (on a national income
accounts basis) particularly in the defense sector, and staff estimates
now call for an equally moderate increase in the fourth quarter. But
it is not clear to what extent the third quarter experience may already
reflect the statutory spending constraints enacted by Congress last
June, or how much further these limits may be expected to bite during
the fourth quarter. On the receipts side of the budget also, forecasters
are presently taking somewhat different views of the fourth quarter.
This seems to be due largely to differences of interpretation as to the
significance for the fourth quarter of the unexpectedly large receipts
from withheld income taxes in September.
In these circumstances forecasts of Treasury cash borrowing
requirements over the remainder of the calendar year tend to vary more
than usual. Board staff estimates still show a fourth quarter cash
deficit of nearly $9 billion. A part of this deficit is being financed
by drawing down the unusually large ($8.6 billion) cash balance avail-
able at the end of September, and the Treasury has already borrowed an
additional $3 billion in June tax bills for payment on October 24.
Nevertheless, Board staff estimates--in contrast to current market
expectations--indicate that even with $2.0 billion of further net cash
borrowing in late November, the Treasury would end the calendar year
with a balance of only $4.9 billion, and would probably have to borrow
temporarily from the Federal Reserve around mid-December when the balance
drops to a seasonal low.

III -23
At the close of business on October 23, the Treasury is
expected to announce plans for its mid-November refunding. This refund-
ing will refinance $3.9 billion of publicly-held issues maturing at that
time, and possibly also will include $1.6 billion of publicly-held
issues maturing in December. The Treasury is also likely to indicate
any other financing plans for later in the calendar year, which will
depend to some extent on the form and scope of the mid-November refund-
ing.

Exchange market developments. Activity in foreign exchange
markets during the first three weeks of October was relatively une-
ventful. Demand for sterling, the Canadian dollar and the Swiss franc
continued firm while there was significant easing of the speculation
which had favored the German mark during most of September. Selling
pressure on the French franc apparently eased.
The price of gold has not shown much net change in October.
It opened the month at $39.45 an ounce, eased during the week of the
IMF meetings, spurted to just under $40.00 in response to South Africa's
rejection of the G-10 compromise gold marketing proposal, and has since
fallen back to around $39.00 an ounce.
Sterling traded in a range between 238.84 and 239.07 during
the first three weeks of October. Demand has been generally firm and
the Bank of England has been able to purchase a modest amount of dol-
lars in the exchange market, although the market at times has reflected
nervousness over the reliability of Labor party support of the Wilson
austerity program, wildcat London dock strikes, and a threatened nation-
wide engineering union strike (which has now been postponed until late
November). The market did not react either way to the September trade
figures, which were little changed from those for August.

IV -2
The discount on forward sterling has narrowed appreciably --
probably indicating enhanced confidence in the pound. On 3-month
contracts the discount narrowed to around 1.3 per cent per annum by
October 21 from 2.0 per cent in late September. The narrower forward
discount has resulted in a covered interest arbitrage opportunity
favorable to investment in sterling hire-purchase deposits vis-a-vis
Euro-dollars and it has been reported that funds have begun to flow
into sterling on this basis, contributing to the spot demand.
Speculative demand for the German mark was reversed about
the beginning of October and since then the mark has generally been
under selling pressure. The Bundesbank has sold over $400 million
(net) in the spot market so far in October, not allowing the exchange
rate to move below 25.094. In addition it has done over $600 million
in swaps with commercial banks -- selling dollars spot and buying them
forward. This was done to offset almost equal payments the Bundesbank
received from maturing swaps contracted early last month.
It has become more difficult to get a precise indication of
the extent of current selling pressures on the French franc because
the Bank of France has begun to do offsetting swaps with French com-
mercial banks -- buying U.S. dollars spot and selling them forward --
for which data are not available. Bank of France losses net of these
swaps have been very moderate so far in October, although the exchange
rate has been above its lower support limit on only six trading days
since October 1.

A strongly favorable trade balance continues to keep the
Canadian dollar exchange rate at its upper limit, although the Bank
of Canada has not had to intervene in the exchange market this month.
Tight financial market conditions in Switzerland and the Netherlands
reportedly are responsible for the currently strong demand for the

U.S. balance of payments. The preliminary monthly data
for September showed a somewhat better outcome for the month than
had been estimated on the basis of weekly reports, so that in the
third quarter the liquidity deficit before special transactions was
probably closer to an annual rate of $2-1/2 billion than the $3 billion
rate estimated earlier. For the first nine months of 1968 the
liquidity deficit before special transactions totalled $2.6 billion,
($3-1/2 billion annual rate) compared to a nine-months total of
$3.3 billion last year. Most of the difference is in the third
quarter total, which was $1.1 billion last year as against some
$650 million this year.
It will be recalled that in the final quarter of 1967 the
liquidity deficit before special transactions soared to $1.5 billion
(S.A.), under the combined pressure of a deteriorating current
account and a continuation of very large outflows of private U.S.
capital. In fact, in most recent years the liquidity deficit has
tended to deteriorate in the fourth quarter even after allowing

IV -4
for seasonal influences in the various categories of transactions,
though not to the same extent as last year. This year there are
grounds for reasoning that the fourth quarter outcome should not
show a significant worsening from the annual rate of about $3-1/2
billion registered in the first three quarters, though there will
probably be a worsening from the third quarter rate. The balance
on goods and services is expected to show a modest improvement as
the trade balance makes further gains. On capital account, it
seems plausible to expect further sizable foreign purchases of U.S.
equity securities, while the restrictions on outflows of U.S. private
capital should prevent a recurrence of the large outflows of non-
bank capital that occurred in the closing months of 1967, though
considerable leeway remains for bank credits to foreigners.
The figures given above differ very substantially, of
course, from the published liquidity deficits, which reflect the
inclusion of receipts from special transactions. As shown in
Appendix A, the published liquidity deficits show an improvement
from $660 million in the first quarter to $170 million in the second,
and probably to a still smaller figure in the third. On this basis
the liquidity deficit during the first nine months was at an annual
rate of only about $1-1/4 billion. To maintain a similarly low
figure in the fourth quarter will require further strenuous efforts
by the Treasury to have large additional amounts of foreign official
reserve holdings lodged in non-liquid forms in the United States.

IV -5
Information on transactions in September is still very
meager. Some indications of the outcome for exports and imports
are given below. On bank lending, partial reports under the VFCR
indicate an increase of claims in September on the order of $50-
$100 million. For the third quarter as a whole this would give a
small net unadjusted inflow. The seasonal adjustment,largely
based on experience before the restraint programs, will convert this
to a sizable outflow, but there is in fact very little indication
of a general rise in bank lending to foreigners.
Net foreign purchases of U.S. equity securities appear
to have been somewhat under $100 million in September, as they were
in August. Though high by standards of earlier years, this rate is
somewhat lower than in the first seven months of the year. U.S.
net purchases of foreign equity securities rose to $80 million in
August and rose further in September, but this spurt in purchases
represents direct investments by U.S. companies in two U.K.
tobacco companies out of funds borrowed abroad, so that there was
no net impact on the balance of payments.
U.S. foreign trade. The official trade statistics for
U.S. exports and imports in September are not yet available but
partial data (duty receipts, number of export documents, etc.)
suggest an increase in the export surplus for that month. In
both August and September, exports to a considerable degree, and
imports to a lesser extent, were inflated by an acceleration in

IV -6
shipments in anticipation of an East Coast and Gulf Coast longshore-
men's strike on October 1. The strike, which did start on that date,
was almost immediately halted by an injunction under the Taft-Hartley
Act. The 80 day "cooling-off" period of the injunction will last
until December 20.
Following the short-lived strike, port activity at New York
in the first part of October was reported to be less than 30 per cent
of normal; between 10-14 days are needed for sufficient pipeline
cargo to accumulate to permit resumption of cargo movement at the
usual pace. This suggests that exports, and to some extent imports,
in October may drop sharply from the expanded September volume.
Including an estimate for September, the third quarter
export surplus may have approximated an annual rate of a little
more than $1 billion (balance of payments basis), compared to the
less than $1/4 billion rate in the first half of the year.
Exports in the third quarter are estimated to have been
at a rate about 8 per cent higher than in the first six months of
1968. Shipments of agricultural commodities were approximately
5 per cent below the rate of the first six months. Exports of
such products were reported to have slipped badly in September,
principally because of lower commercial sales of wheat and corn,
and PL 480 deliveries of wheat. This decline reflects, in large
part, the world-wide abundance of grain supplies. But commercial
sales of wheat were particularly heavy in August as foreign buyers

IV -7
sought to avoid paying the higher prices that became effective with
implementation of the new Industrial Grains Arrangement by the U.S.
in late August.
Despite a drop in deliveries of commercial aircraft in
September to the second lowest monthly amount this year, exports of
nonagricultural commodities are estimated to have expanded further
in that month and in the third quarter, reflecting not only the
strike induced acceleration but also a pick up in deliveries of
automotive equipment to Canada. Export orders for machinery through
August continue their slow rise and the backlog of such orders
remains high.
Imports in September are estimated to have increased,
possibly exceeding the record rate of last June. For the entire
third quarter, it appears that imports were slightly higher than
in the second quarter. The rate of expansion, however, was
apparently much lower than in the spring quarter. The ratio of
imports to the GNP in the third quarter is estimated to have been
3.9 per cent, nearly the same as the ratio in the second quarter.
Imports of finished goods, including such items as
machinery, automobiles, textile and other nonfood consumer goods,
have been particularly strong in the last few months, accounting
for a greater share of total imports than in the early part of
the year.

IV -8
Cars from Canada in September are thought to have increased
sharply, as Canadian production of the new 1969 models accelerated.
Imports of coffee continued to exceed current use, suggesting that
the heavy accumulation of inventories in the first half of the year
continued through September.

IV- 9
Payments balances of other industrial countries. Changes in
the underlying payments position of other important industrial countries
in the second and third quarters were reinforced in some cases by
speculative flows based on possible exchange rate alterations. The
French franc, long regarded as a strong currency, fell under speculative
attack in the spring as uncertainty arose as to whether the French
economy could absorb large wage and price increases without a change in
the parity of the franc. As a result of this speculation, France experienced
a reservedrain of $3.3 billion in the second and third quarters, financed
half by a reduction in official reserves of gold and dollars and half by
drawing on the IMF and central bank credits.
Speculation also arose this summer about a possible German mark
revaluation. This speculation stemmed from uncertainty as to Germany's
ability to maintain private capital outflows big enough to offset
Germany's large trade surplus. Official reserve accruals were held down
partly through continued long-term capital outflows and partly through
Bundesbank DM/dollar swaps with commercial banks; a large portion of
these swaps carry through the turn of the year, which may help to ease
year-end strains on foreign exchange markets.
Italy continued to realize large payments surpluses during the
second and third quarters; the Italian surplus in the first three quarters
was even larger this year, at $514 million, than in the same period last
year, when the surplus totaled $383 million. Switzerland's surplus has
also been of large magnitude this year.

IV -10
The United Kingdom, on the other hand, appeared to be making
some progress in bringing its payments back into balance. The improvement
took place on both trade and long-term capital accounts. The failure of
U.K. imports to decline is, however, still a cause for grave concern.
Canada and Japan moved into payments surplus during the period.
Canada recovered completely during the second and third quarters from
the March run on the Canadian dollar. Japan's external balance, in
substantial deficit a year ago, moved into a surplus position by the
second quarter of 1968. Of the smaller countries, the Netherlands improved
its payments positions somewhat, while Sweden's small surplus shrank
further.
On the whole, however, imbalances in world payments still
continue to be serious enough to generate recurrent speculation about the
possibility of exchange rate alterations in the coming months.
The greatest payments and reserve shift during the second and
third quarters was experienced by France. Information regarding changes
in French commercial bank net foreign positions is available only through
July, but in the April-July period improvement of $1.3 billion in commercial
banks' net external position offset official reserve losses to a considerable
extent. Consequently the overall balance of payments deficit in April-July--
as measured by changes in net official and commercial bank external
positions--amounted to $1,013 million. (See Tables 1 and 2.) This contrasts
with an overall surplus of $111 million in April-July 1967 and a deficit
of $257 million in the six months ending March 1968. The improvement of

commercial banks' net external position in April-July 1968 reflected the
results of several types of transactions: (1) a decrease in French
banks' franc and foreign currency liabilities to foreigners as the latter
sought to get their funds out of francs and out of the country; (2) an
increase in franc denominated claims on foreigners as the latter increased
their franc borrowings and presumably sold the francs for foreign currencies
in hopes of realizing a profit if the franc were devalued before the loan
matured; and (3) an increase in foreign currency assets as French residents
shifted out of francs into foreign currencies and deposited the foreign
currencies with banks in France.
Official reserve losses have continued in October. Transactions
through the Federal Reserve Bank of New York would indicate net losses of
more than $100 million; in addition the Bank of France is reported to be
engaging in swaps with French commercial banks, buying dollars spot and
selling them forward, and using the spot dollars thus acquired.
France is expected to end the year with a substantial balance
of payments deficit and to incur another large deficit in 1969. The
seasonally-adjusted trade account (f.o.b. basis) swung into deficit
following the strikes in the second quarter and remained in deficit
in the third quarter. According to national accounts forecasts just
released, for 1968 as a whole imports from outside the franc area are
expected to increase by 13.4 per cent while exports are expected to grow
by 12.1 per cent. In 1969, the projected import and export growth rates
are 15.1 and 12.9 per cent respectively. With imports on an f.o.b. basis,

IV -13
these projections would yield trade deficits of approximately $200 million
in 1968 and $500 million in 1969, compared with an actual deficit of
$67 million in 1967. The overall current account deficits for 1968 and
1969 are expected to be even larger since the services account is also
expected to swing into deficit.
Germany's overall balance of payments shifted from the surplus
which had been maintained on the whole since early 1966 to a small deficit
in the second quarter of this year, and continued to run monthly deficits
through August. The emergence of a net debit in Germany's external trans-
actions resulted from a large-scale net export of private capital--primarily
long-term--which arose as a consequence of unusually easy credit conditions
in Germany and resulting low interest rate levels relative to those in
other major financial centers. This net outflow of private capital was
large enough, in combination with outflows on services, donations and
official capital accounts, to more than offset Germany's extremely large
trade surplus. The resulting overall deficit amounted to $77 million in
the second quarter and $199 million in July-August.
Despite this development, rumors of a possible DM revaluation
have been encouraged by the prospect that the very large trade surplus
would continue for some time and the possibility that the net private
capital outflow could not be sustained. In late August and early
September, speculation erupted and the Bundesbank found it necessary to
purchase about $1.8 billion in order to support the rate for the dollar
on the exchange market, The Bundesbank entered into dollar/DM swaps with

IV -14
commercial banks, selling dollars spot and buying them forward at rates
more favorable than those in the market, in order to keep these funds
from accruing to its foreign exchange reserves. Swaps made at the end of
August and in the first two weeks of September amounted to $1.8 billion,
of which approximately $500 million matured in the first half of October.
Most if not all of the maturing swaps were renewed; the Bundesbank made
it particularly attractive for banks to renew their cover for a three-
month period, i.e., past the turn of the year, in order to minimize the
customary year-end capital inflow produced by German commercial bank
window dressing.
The April-August payments deficit was financed by a drawing down
of commercial bank net foreign assets. The decline in commercial banks'
foreign positions has been greater than the overall deficit so that
German net official reserves rose. (See Tables 1 and 2.) Commercial
banks may have drawn on their foreign positions to build up their
domestic liquidity positions or to help meet domestic credit demand.
More recently, as speculative expectations have subsided, the DM has weakened
on the exchange markets. In the period October 1-23, the Bundesbank has
experienced a reserve drain of $420 million.
The April-July period showed an improvement in the United Kingdom's
balance of payments and reserves. Net official reserve losses were reduced
from $1.4 billion in the first quarter to $1.0 billion in the second quarter,
and there was a net reserve gain of $274 million in July-August.

IV -15
The improvement in the overall payments balance resulted from
improvements on both trade and long-term capital accounts. The U.K.'s
trade deficit (on a seasonally-adjusted balance of payments basis)
declined in the second quarter to $526 million from an average of
$662 million in the two preceding quarters and declined further in the
third quarter to $329 million. This improvement reflected a substantial
increase in exports, particularly in the third quarter when they averaged
7 per cent higher than in the first quarter. Import performance, however,
has been disappointing as imports have remained very high despite devaluation
and a restrictive domestic policy. Imports in the third quarter were
2 per cent higher than first quarter levels. Imports of food and manufactures
have declined somewhat, giving some evidence that the Government's policy
of restraint is having some effect in lowering consumer demand. However,
fuel and basic material imports have risen both in volume and value.
An improvement in the second quarter on official long-term
capital account also helped the balance of payments. Part of the improve-
ment represented receipt of a 4-1/2 year, $50 million loan from the German
Government, extended as part of Germany's military offset payment to the
U.K. A small improvement over first quarter results would still have
been realized, however, without this receipt.
Despite these improvements, the U.K.'s progress in eliminating
its balance of payments deficit is about six months behind the schedule
envisaged at the time of devaluation. British officials now estimate that
the 1968 balance of payments deficit on current and long-term capital

IV -16
transactions will approximately equal the 1967 deficit of $1.2 billion.
This estimate implies a $240 million deficit in the second half of this
year, which would combine a deficit exceeding this amount in the third
quarter with a small surplus in the last quarter. The surplus is expected
to rise during the course of 1969 to an annual rate of $700 million to
$1.0 billion in the second half of the year.
Italy's external accounts showed a substantial surplus in the
second and third quarters, the period of seasonal strength of the Italian
balance of payments. This year's surplus was considerably larger than in
the comparable period of 1967.
Through August, the Italian trade balance continued to be much
more favorable than in 1967. Export receipts were 12 per cent higher than
a year earlier in the second quarter and 18 per cent higher in July-August.
Import payments were up from a year earlier by only 1 per cent in the second
quarter and 5 per cent in July-August. These increases in imports were,
on average, much smaller than in 1967 (when they were 8 per cent above
1966), partly because of the slower rate of expansion of domestic economic
activity this year.
The net outflow of private capital has continued to run well
ahead of 1967 results, and the increase has offset a significant part of
the improvement in the trade balance. In the April-August period net
capital outflows totaled $465 million compared to an outflow of $303 mil-
lion in the comparable 1967 period. The increase in the net private capital
outflow in the first half of the year, and probably in the third quarter

IV -17
as well, took the form chiefly of larger exports of Italian banknotes
in addition, foreign portfolio investment in Italy declined while Italian
portfolio investment abroad increased.
The major part of Italy's payments surplus was financed by an
improvement in the net foreign position of the commercial banks, the first
time in about two years that the banks' foreign positions had shown any
appreciable increase. This improvement is apparently not the result of
any easing of the Bank of Italy's policy of severely limiting the volume
of its new lira/dollar swaps with the commercial banks. Rather, banks
are said to have let some foreign currency loans to residents run off
because of a weakening of loan demand in Italy and to have placed the
funds in foreign markets.
Overall balance of payments figures for Switzerland, which are
available only through the second quarter, show the payments surplus
continuing at a very high level. The surplus amounted to $291 million in
the first quarter and $396 million in the second quarter; last year the
first quarter recorded a surplus of $80 million and the second a nominal
deficit of $4 million. The large increases in the overall surplus appear
to reflect inflows of speculative capital in the first two quarters of
this year; an improvement of only $102 million in the unadjusted trade
account in the first half of the year is not sufficient to explain the
increase; moreover, the export of funds from Switzerland as a result of
foreign bond flotations in the country was only $24 million greater than
in the first half of last year.

IV -18
The first quarter surplus was probably affected by speculative
flows out of dollars or sterling into Swiss francs, motivated by the same
fears that resulted in the rush to buy gold. In the second quarter, the
flight of French capital to Switzerland was very heavy, much of it in the
form of French banknotes. In mid-July, the Swiss National Bank informed
the American Embassy that the flow of French capital into Switzerland
since the start of the unrest in France was estimated by them at about
$1 billion.
Canada recovered completely in the second and third quarters
from the March speculative attack on the Canadian dollar. The overall
payments surplus for the April-August period amounted to U.S. $835 million
compared to a deficit of $407 million in the preceding six month period.
Canada's official reserves increased by U.S. $651 million during the
second and third quarters, thus recouping most of the $816 million lost
in the first quarter. Official holdingsof gold and U.S. dollars at the
end of September amounted to $2,534 million, very near the reserve ceiling
agreed upon between Canada and the United States.
A major factor in the dramatic turnaround of Canada's balance of
payments was the massive reversal of capital flows. Complete balance of
payments data,available only through the second quarter, show a swing from
a net capital outflow of $486 million in the first quarter to a net inflow
of $571 million in the second quarter. The improvement in the capital
account was about evenly divided between long- and short-term flows. In
the second quarter Canada borrowed $275 million in European capital markets,

IV -19
a large part of which consisted of government borrowing for reserve
purposes. Normally Canada does most of its foreign borrowing in the
U.S. capital market.
Canada also registered a notable improvement between the first
two quarters in its current account. This was primarily attributable
to an increased merchandise surplus and most of this improvement was
gained in trade with the United States.
Japan also registered a large swing in its balance of payments
from substantial deficit in 1967 to a surplus position as of the second
quarter of this year. In April-August Japan's external surplus totaled
$567 million in contrast to a deficit of $232 million registered in the
same period of 1967. The swing into surplus has resulted mainly from a
large improvement on trade account as domestic demand pressures have
abated while foreign demand has accelerated sharply. Exports in the third
quarter were 25 per cent higher than in the same period a year earlier;
the export boom has been significantly supported by heavy demand from
the United States. Imports rose 9 per cent over the same period. The
seasonally-adjusted trade balance consequently swung from a deficit of
$312 million in the third quarter of 1967 to a surplus of $95 million in
the third quarter this year.
