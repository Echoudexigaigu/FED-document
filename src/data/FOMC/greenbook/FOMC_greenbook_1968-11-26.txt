CURRENT ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL CONDITIONS

I- 1
SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK
Outlook for economic activity
Most recent indicators suggest a continuing high rate of
economic activity in the fourth quarter. The labor market remains
tight; production and employment levels have risen and, in view of the
high rate of housing starts earlier, residential construction outlays
are expected to rise. As a result of recent strengthening of activity
and prospects for continued--although less rapid--increases, business-
men have apparently stepped up their plans for plant and equipment
expenditures next year.
Nevertheless, some indications of slowing in the rate of
expansion have also become apparent. Retail sales have shown little
gain since August, and personal income in October rose only half as
much as in other recent months.
On balance, expected smaller increases in both consumer
expenditures and government spending in the fourth quarter are likely
to result in a rise in GNP somewhat less than in the preceding quarter.
This would mean some further slackening in growth in real GNP, but at
the same time with price pressures continuing strong.
The outlook still appears to suggest a further moderation of
expansion in the first half of 1969, assuming no sudden change in the
Vietnam situation. Growth in consumer expenditures should be dampened
by a slower growth of disposable income as a result of higher social
security taxes and retroactive payments on the surtax in the first half

I- 2
of the year. The advance in total outlays by the Federal Government
is expected to be very slow; from now until mid-1969, the rise will be
largely in transfer payments, grants to States and CCC support opera-
tions. Further expansion in residential construction outlays is likely
to be constrained by availability of funds.
While there is now some evidence of increasing strength in
the capital goods sector--which has shown little expansion in real terms
for over a year--there seems little likelihood of a renewed capital
goods boom if growth in other sectors of demand soften, the capacity
utilization rate remains low, and profits level off or decline as now
projected.
Outlook for prices and resource use
At retail, the rise in average consumer prices slowed for
the third quarter as a whole, in large part because of a leveling off
in food prices; prices of most non-food commodities continued to rise,
with especially sharp increases for some major items in September. In
October prices of new model autos were boosted.
At wholesale, the price rise for industrial commodities
accelerated somewhat further in October. While the auto price increase
accounted for the major share of the rise, the diffusion of price
increases widened further, reaching nearly as large a proportion as
last January and February when industrial prices were showing their
peak rate of increase. Since mid-October, the major price development
has been an unusually sharp cut in prices of a major steel product, in
part to meet import competition.

I- 3
The rate of rise in the average level of prices in private
sectors of the economy--as measured by the GNP deflator exclusive of
the Federal pay increase--is expected to rebound somewhat in the fourth
quarter, after slowing in the third.
The projected easing of demand pressures should limit the
price rise, however, and the further slowing in GNP projected in the
first half of 1969, should contribute to a modest decleration in the
advance of the GNP deflator.
By early next year a little easing of wage pressures may be
anticipated from the demand side of the labor market. Some easing in
demand for labor--and a gradual drift-up in the unemployment rate--is
expected to accompany any moderation in employment growth associated
with the expected slowing of expansion in aggregate demands in the first
half of 1969.
Industrial production began to move up again in September,
instead of declining somewhat further. The October level was still
slightly below the peaks reached at midyear at the climax of the steel
hedge-buying boom, and the rate of manufacturing capacity utilization
is down somewhat from the rate prevailing from late 1967 through July.
Production expansion from here on may lag, slightly, the ongoing
expansion in capacity, with the result that the over-all capacity
margin will remain ample.
Outlook for credit demands
Credit demands are expected to taper off in the early months
of next year, although remaining sizable between now and the end of

I-4
1968. Corporate borrowing from banks is likely to be rather large
around mid-December, when income tax payments will be about a third
more than a year ago. Some tax payments may be made through use of
maturing CD's, but the amount of CD's maturing on the tax date appears
to be less than a year ago. And with the cost of commercial paper
financing only an eighth of a percentage point below the prime rate,
corporations do not have any great incentive to use that market for
very temporary borrowing. Once the tax period is past, however, the
slower growth in the economy anticipated for the first quarter of the
next year would tend to hold down business loan demands.
So far as can be discerned from offerings on the docket and
underwriters' views as to potential offerings, the prospective volume
of corporate and municipal bond issues is likely to moderate from the
recent pace. But in both markets, the near-term calendar is heavy,
with nearly all of the December volume scheduled in the first half of
the month. The December municipal volume could be enlarged further by
a surge of industrial revenue bond offerings before the year-end cut-off
date, but there are currently reports that some such issues may have to
be held off the market because market rates have moved beyond the
interest rate ceilings of some States. And in the municipal market in
particular, the distribution of new issues is complicated by the large
volume of dealer inventories that still overhangs the market.
U.S. Government security dealers have made reasonable progress
in distributing the new notes offered in the mid-November refinancing.
With respect to the 6-year note, dealers sold out nearly one-third of

I- 5
their holdings by payment date. Total dealer holdings of coupon issues
maturing in more than five years--including fairly sizable holdings of
the 7-year note issued in the mid-August refunding--would not be des-
cribed as unusually large, but they are large enough to be a source of
market discomfort, particularly so should expectations about bond prices
become more bearish.
Apart from the $2 billion tax bill financing announced to be
auctioned on November 26, with payment on December 2, the next scheduled
Treasury financing would be the mid-February refunding, to be announced
at the end of January. It also appears likely that some further new
cash will have to be raised during the first quarter, given the rela-
tively low level of the cash balance expected at year-end; there is a
possibility that some of this cash might have to be raised in January.
Supply of funds
The inflow of time and savings deposits to banks is expected
to be at a diminished rate over the balance of 1968, as banks' flexi-
bility under Regulation Q ceilings has been sharply curtailed. The
current level of short-term market rates has recently forced banks to
move up to Regulation Q ceiling rates for large negotiable CD's around
the 3-month area to keep offerings competitive; even at ceiling rates,
banks do not appear to be able to obtain funds in volume. Net inflows
of consumer-type time and savings deposits are also expected to be some-
what lower over the remainder of the year than the rapid October pace;
the growth surge at city banks that occurred in early October apparently

I -6
reflected in part one-shot transfers of savings. Given the over-all
time deposit outlook, banks may be expected to take a more cautious
attitude toward further investments in securities.
This attitude, coupled with heavy near-term credit demands,
is likely to lead to upward pressures on longer-term interest rates
between now and year end, or at least sustain the rates at recent high
levels. The extent of such upward pressures would tend to be moderated
if the market still anticipated an easing of credit conditions next
year, when Federal credit needs are projected to slacken. They may
also be moderated if any rise in short-term interest rates which may
develop in the period immediately ahead can be interpreted as no greater
than seasonal, or if exchange markets settle down.
The pick-up in net savings flows to the thrift institutions
during October and early November suggests that the rate of inflow
during the fourth quarter as a whole may somewhat exceed the depressed
pace of the preceding few quarters. Although demands for mortgage
credit seem likely to continue strong, new mortgage lending commitments
may increase only modestly at best, in view of the large backlog of out-
standing commitments scheduled for takedown by year end. Lender caution
in granting new commitments will undoubtedly be enhanced by the usual
uncertainties about the year-end dividend reinvestment period applicable
to all outstanding savings accounts. These considerations, together
with recent advances in the level of corporate bond yields, suggest no
further decline in mortgage yields within either the primary market or

I- 7
the secondary market, and possibly some short-run rise. With a high
level of mortgage yields, banks and other lenders not normally active
in mortgage markets might show an increased willingness to undertake
mortgage lending.
While the interaction of supply and demand forces suggest
continued upward over-all market interest rate pressures in the short-
run, or at least maintenance of high yield levels, interest rates may
be under downward pressure in early 1969 in view of the expected modera-
tion of credit demands. Over the whole period, rates of expansion in
time deposits and the money supply may be relatively moderate in view
of the projected slower growth in GNP and assuming any interest rate
declines that might develop are comparatively limited.

I -8
International developments. In the past seven days the French
franc-German mark exchange crisis has spread far enough to infect the
market for sterling. Whether or not an early resolution of this crisis
is achieved, increasing public attention is now likely to be directed
at the underlying state of the U.S. balance of payments. A new Administra-
tion will soon be reviewing the position in the merchandise trade and
private capital accounts, in considering the need for continuation of
the controls on capital movements.
It remains probable that the moderate net improvement that has
occurred over the past year on balance in the current and private capital
accounts--apart from the huge inflows through the Euro-dollar market--
will be extended further in coming months. However, part of the September
gain in the merchandise trade balance, due to the port strike threat, will
have been at the expense of October. Further distortions of the export
trend may occur before and after the Taft-Hartley injunction expires.
By the third quarter the balance of private capital movements
was probably as favorable as can be achieved. It is unlikely that
foreign purchases of U.S. securities will rise further next year beyond
recent high levels. Slackening or reversal of U.S. bank credit repayment
flows has already set in, and further changes in this sector will not
be large, assuming the VFCR is continued. Information on direct invest-
ment capital and income flows always lags, but indirect indications
suggest a substantial improvement from the second to the third quarter
in this sector; if so, here again a further marked improvement next year
could hardly be looked for.

I -9
Repercussions of the French franc crisis during the third
quarter were in general favorable for the U.S. payments and reserve
positions. The major impact was through increasing the supply of funds
in the Euro-dollar market. Possibly also the temporary--and largely
unexplained--improvement in the underlying balance in May, June, and
July owed something to movements out of the franc. Since mid-September
liquid capital flows in Europe have been going increasingly toward the
German mark rather than toward the Euro-dollar, interest rates in the
Euro-dollar market have risen considerably, and there has been no net
inflow to the United States through U.S. bank branches. There are no
strong reasons at present to expect either a large inflow or a large
outflow next year.

THE ECONOMIC PICTURE IN DETAIL
The Nonfinancial Scene
Gross national product. The rise in GNP this quarter will
probably be slower than in the third quarter, but nevertheless October
data on production and employment confirm the view that business
activity remains strong. Current dollar GNP is expected to rise at
the rate of about $15 billion, $3 billion less than in the third
quarter. Consumer expenditures are expected to rise at a much slower
rate than last quarter, largely as a result of a leveling-off of
purchases of durable goods. Small increases in Government spending
and in business fixed investment will contribute most of the remaining
growth in GNP this quarter. One major imponderable, as usual, is the
extent of inventory build-up. We have projected a larger build-up than
last quarter--outside of steel--because of high levels of current pro-
duction, generally favorable business expectations, and a slackening
increase in final sales. The rate of growth in real GNP is expected to
fall from 5 per cent to about 3.5 per cent.
Gains in current dollar GNP are expected to slow moderately
further in the first half of 1969, if Federal government purchases of
goods and services continue to be held in sharp check, and there is
little expansion in the supply of mortgage funds for residential con-
struction. The more moderate growth in final demand projected for the
first half of next year reflects mainly smaller rates of increase in
consumer expenditures, residential construction, and State and local

II -2
government outlays. For the first half, the rate of real growth as
indicated by the deflated GNP is likely to average about 2.5 per cent.
Moderate easing in price-wage pressures may reasonably be
expected to develop as demands on resources are reduced somewhat. The
annual rate of increase in the GNP deflator is expected to dip to about
3 per cent in the first half of 1969 from an estimated 3.5 per cent at
present. This appraisal of first half developments rests on the
assumption that the international situation and Budget prospects do
not alter substantially.
This longer-term outlook is generally consistent with our
projections incorporated in the Chart Show of October 29, since no data
have become available since then which appear to alter the outlook
appreciably. A minor exception is the McGraw-Hill survey of business
intentions to invest in plant and equipment in 1969, which indicates a
moderately stronger outlook for capital spending than we had anticipated.
The fourth quarter slowdown rests heavily on the assumption
that the surge in consumer buying which occurred last quarter has sub-
sided. October data indicate that retail sales were no higher than in
August. Although unit domestic auto sales increased in October to
slightly above the 9 million rate of last quarter (early November auto
sales showed some easing), furniture and appliance sales have declined
moderately in the last two months. Nondurable goods sales account for
all the rise projected in expenditures for consumer goods in the fourth
quarter. Expenditures for services, of course, continue to expand
rapidly.

II -3
Although the rise in personal income in the current quarter
should be less than in the third (October data show a significantly
smaller increase), the major impact of the surcharge is over. Income-
after-taxes thus is resuming a faster rate of increase--although at a
pace likely to be sharply below that of the first half of the year.
It now seems likely that the growth in consumer expenditures this
quarter will more or less parallel the rise in disposable income, so
that personal saving will not vary appreciably from the sharply reduced
third quarter rate of 6.3 per cent.
The impact of the surcharge has thus far appeared small
because of the willingness of consumers and business to reduce their
rates of saving. For consumers, however, no comparable reduction in
saving can be expected next year, although, as we have suggested, there
may be a further edging down. Thus, with the rise in income already
moderating, growth in consumer expenditures in the first half of 1969
seems likely to slow substantially further.
Residential construction expenditures are expected to rise
somewhat this quarter as a result of an increase in the volume of hous-
ing starts in the third quarter to a rate of 1.55 million. Demographic
factors and an accumulated deficiency of housing suggest that the rate
of starts will remain as high as available financing sources permit.
However, inflows into mortgage institutions have not improved, and this
development will probably limit further advances in the volume of starts.
Thus, little further expansion is anticipated in the dollar value of
residential construction activity in next year's first half.

II -4
Business investment in plant and equipment this quarter is
projected to rise somewhat faster than was indicated by the August
Commerce-SEC intentions survey, partly because of the recent rise in
both machinery orders and in the output of machinery.
Despite the relatively large increase in business inventories
in the second and third quarters, inventory-sales ratios at the end of
September were relatively low even though durable goods inventories
were inflated by excessive steel stocks. The ratio for both durables
and nondurables was somewhat below that prevailing last year, although
the durables ratio was still well above that in 1966. Thus, with the
current optimism about sales prospects and continued strong price move-
ments, it seems reasonable to expect a large accumulation in this quarter.
Steel stocks are projected to drop by over $2 billion in the quarter, which
implies an expansion in other sectors at an annual rate of about $10 billion.
Growth in Federal expenditures for goods and services are
expected to slow further this quarter, and for the remainder of the
fiscal year. The major exception is CCC purchases of farm commodities,
which began to rise last quarter, and may well amount to over one
billion dollars at an annual rate this quarter and next, but should then
shrink sharply. Defense spending is expected to expand moderately
further through the first quarter, and then to level off, the year's
average being somewhat above that shown in the Midyear Budget Review.
The total rise in Federal expenditures (NIA basis) over the fiscal year
(measured from the second quarter 1968 to the second quarter 1969) is
expected to be less than half the increase occurring in each of the
preceding two years.

II -5
The Federal deficit is expected to dip from a rate of $9.5
billion in the first half of calendar 1968 to about $3.5 billion in the
second half, followed by a surplus in the second quarter of next year.
Corporate profits have performed better than expected, so that profits
taxes are exceeding estimates, and collections on individual income
taxes are also running high. Nevertheless, extra payments owing to the
surtax are estimated to average $3 billion at an annual rate in each of
the first two quarters of 1969, further slowing the rise in the after-
tax income of consumers.

Industrial production. Industrial production increased
further in October to 165.0 per cent of the 1957-59 average from the
revised September level of 164.4. The index for September was revised
upwards by one percentage point as a result of revisions in the BLS
production worker manhour figures and in physical output data for
selected industries, especially paper and products. Output gains were
widespread in October among final products and materials, but total
production was held down by strikes in the coal industry early in the
month which represented a downdrag of .4 of a point in the total index.
Auto assemblies recovered from the slight dip in September
and were at an annual rate of 9.2 million units. November and December
production schedules are presently set at the October rate. Output of
household appliances rose sharply in September (the latest month for
which data are available) and production of television sets increased
further in October. Output of most other home goods was maintained at
advanced levels and production of consumer staples continued to rise.
The revised employment data for September and the preliminary
October data indicate some strengthening in output of business equipment,
as shown in the table. All lines except commercial equipment have
shared in the September and October gains. Production of defense equip-
ment, however, has declined 2.3 per cent from the August peak.

Output of iron and steel rose about 3.5 per cent in October,
and in early November production of raw steel continued to increase.
Output of most other industrial materials also rose in October.
If the trends in industrial production which developed in
September and October continue, the total index in November could rise
by one percentage point or more, including the effect of ending the
coal strike. The edging off of total retail sales in recent months
and the drop in unit sales of new domestic autos in early November will
probably not dampen production this month.
Capacity utilization. The October rate of manufacturing
capacity utilization was estimated to be 83.3 per cent, slightly above
the upward-revised 83.1 per cent for September. At its present level,
the operating rate is still 1.5 points below its second quarter average,
but almost all of this decline is accounted for by reduced steel pro-
duction.
Since the middle of 1967, estimated growth rates of manufac-
turing output and capacity have been very evenly balanced and the
operating rate has fluctuated narrowly within an 83 to 85 per cent
range. Most of the movements that have occurred in the series can be
largely explained by strikes or threats of strikes.
Utilization rates remain high in the motor vehicle, rubber,
petroleum and aircraft industries. Unused capacity exists for the
production of most other manufacturing products.

Retail sales. Dollar retail sales declined about 0.5 per
cent in October, according to advance estimates, continuing the pattern
of waning vigor evident since mid-summer. The slight October decline
was almost entirely attributable to a reported 8 per cent reduction in
the automotive group. The large dip in dollar sales of auto dealers is
perplexing since unit sales of new domestic cars--partly in response to
very large fleet sales--rose to a 9.1 million rate in October from 9.0
million the month before.1/ Durable goods excluding autos were up 1.2
per cent in October, and nondurables increased 1.4 per cent.
Total retail sales in October were up 10 per cent from a year
earlier, but sales in October last year were relatively low because of
a Ford strike.

Unit sales and stocks of autos. Sales of new domestic autos
declined in the first 10 days of November (including election day) and
were at an estimated seasonally adjusted annual rate of about 8 million
units, compared with 9.1 million for the month of October. Industry
projections for November sales were at a seasonally adjusted annual
rate of close to 9 million units. To reach this goal sales will have
to increase sharply over the balance of the month.
Auto production was at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
9.3 million units in early November, the scheduled rate set for both

II -12
November and December. Stocks of new domestic autos increased about
seasonally but represented a 54 days supply as compared to 50 days at
the end of October.
Consumer credit. The resurgence of consumer instalment
borrowing underway since early 1967 has been accelerating--by the third
quarter of this year it was adding to consumers funds available for
purchase at an annual rate of close to $9 billion (seasonally adjusted).
The largest proportion of the increase, as with the decline that pre-
ceded it, was in the auto sector, but extensions also ran high in the
major loan categories "other consumer goods" and personal loans.
Despite the rapid increase in the amount of auto credit
outstanding and in auto credit extensions, consumers have not been
using credit more intensively to finance auto purchases; in fact, credit
usage actually has been decreasing in relation to sales. In 1965
extensions of automobile credit amounted to almost 50 per cent of dollar
auto sales. In 1967 this proportion had declined to 47-1/2 per cent.
It increased early this year but has dropped again in the last two
quarters.
On the other hand, consumers have been increasing their
credit usage for nonauto purchases: the proportion of instalment
credit extensions for "other consumer goods" rose somewhat in relation
to GAF sales. In 1965 this proportion was 33 per cent; it has averaged
above this level throughout 1967 and 1968. In relation to disposable
income, the use of instalment credit dipped. Instalment borrowing

II -13
amounted to 16 per cent of disposable income in 1965, but declined in
both 1966 and 1967. However, this measure rose again in 1968 and by
the third quarter was close to the 1965 level.
Consumer buying expectations. The Census October survey
suggests that household demand for durables will probably continue at
a high level, despite the fact that both actual and expected income
changes were less favorable than in July. The index of expected new
car purchases rose to 106.4 from 102.2 a year earlier, and the index
of plans to purchase household durables, at 101.5, was up sharply from
99.4 last October. These are larger over-the-year increases than were
reported in the July survey, probably owing in part to some decrease
in optimism between July and October last year when unemployment was
rising. The index of plans to purchase used cars, on the other hand,
remained unchanged from a year earlier.
The indexes of purchase plans for household durables showed
little change between the July and October surveys. It is difficult to
interpret this stability, however, since these quarterly surveys are
subject to an unknown amount of seasonality.
The index plans to purchase houses, however, is off so
sharply from July that the decline cannot be explained by seasonal
factors alone. While there was a rise in October from a year ago, it
is attributable to an increase in the expected purchase price of homes
and a larger number of households. The mean probability of purchasing
a house within 6 months or 12 months actually declined slightly over
the year.

Fewer households reported in the October survey that their
income was higher, and more households reported that their income had
stayed about the same; 38.0 per cent reported that family income was
higher, compared with 40.3 per cent in July. This was still well above
any quarter of 1967, and the shift was to the number reporting "about
the same" income rather than "lower". The mean probability of a sub-
stantial increase in family income declined to 16.7 from 18.4 in July--
a level slightly above a year ago.
Inventories. The book value of retail inventories rose by
$400 million in September, seasonally adjusted--$100 million in durables
and $300 million in nondurables. The nondurable increase was the largest
monthly change for that group reported this year. The book value of
wholesale inventories declined over $100 million, mainly in the durable
sector.
For the quarter as a whole, trade inventories rose by about
$2.2 billion at an annual rate, substantially below the $6.2 billion

II -15
increase in the second quarter. The accumulation of manufacturing
inventories was also below the high second quarter rate, and nonfarm
inventory accumulation as a whole (GNP basis), at $7.3 billion, was
off $3 billion from the second quarter rate.
The outlook is for a relatively high rate of accumulation of
total nonfarm inventories in the fourth quarter. Dealers' stocks of
new domestic autos increased sharply in October and auto production
continued to outrun sales in early November, suggesting a further accum-
ulation of these stocks for the quarter as a whole. Inventory-sales
ratios in September were below 1967 average levels for both durables
and nondurables, and with continuing strong upward price movements and
a still generally optimistic business outlook; rates of accumulation
higher than in the third quarter are anticipated in most sectors
except the steel-using sector, where excess steel stocks should be
absorbed at a $2 to $3 billion rate.
The table below shows changes during each of the first three
quarters of 1968 (expressed as annual rates) in the book value of manu-
facturing and trade inventories and in unit stocks of steel mill shapes.

While seasonally adjusted private housing starts declined as
expected in October, the decline was relatively minor and to a rate
little changed from the advanced third quarter average. Moreover, the
decline in October was limited to multifamily units and was mainly in
the Northeast states where starts had been exceptionally high in
September.
Seasonally adjusted building permits also declined in
October from an advanced September rate. But, unlike starts, the decline
was largely in single-family units and, though relatively slight,
involved all regions except the Northeast states where there was a mod-
erate upturn. Even if, as seems likely on technical grounds, starts

II -18
decline further in November, demand pressures and other indications
continue to point to the possibility that the average for the quarter
as a whole will remain fairly near the advanced third quarter level.

Underscoring the pressure of demands this year, vacancy rates
have remained unusually low. (Confidential until release this Friday.)
In fact, the third quarter rental vacancy rates averaged only 5.4 per
cent of all rental units available and fit for use--the lowest this
year and the lowest for any third quarter since 1957. While all regions
but the North Central states shared in the third quarter decline, the
drop in the West was particularly sharp.

Home-owner vacancy rates changed little in the third quarter--
at an average of 1.1 per cent. This compared with an average of 1.0 per
cent in the first half of the year and with a third quarter high of 1.6
per cent in 1963. With speculative builders either unable or unwilling
to build ahead of the market, inventories of new homes for sale also
apparently have remained comparatively low. In September--the latest
month for which data are available--such inventories in all stages of
construction totaled almost 200,000 units and were little changed from
the level in other recent months.
In the market for existing homes, unit-sales in September
averaged 16 per cent above a year earlier, according to the National
Association of Real Estate Boards. The relatively low inventory of
homes available for sale has been a limiting factor on transactions in
some cases. However, in September, prices of homes involved in trans-
actions continued to show the same year-to-year increase--5 per cent--
as in most other months this year.1968-

Business capital spending plans. U.S. businesses plan to
increase outlays for new plants and equipment in 1969 by 7.6 per cent
from this year's level, according to the recently-released results of
the McGraw-Hill fall survey. The percentage increase now indicated for
next year is larger than the gains indicated by Commerce-SEC in 1967
and 1968, but it is substantially smaller than the very large gains in
1964, 1965, and 1966. (See table.) In real terms, the increase fixed
capital spending in 1969 is expected to be small, around 2.5 per cent,
if prices of new plants and equipment rise by the 5 per cent now antic-
ipated by businesses. In both 1967 and 1968, real fixed investment
declined slightly.

Manufacturing industries, with forty per cent of this year's
indicated total capital spending, account for nearly sixty per cent of
the total increase in outlays now planned for 1969. Manufacturers'
spending is expected to rise by 10.7 per cent with fairly large increases
by all major industry groupings except petroleum and coal products,
fabricated metals and instruments, and iron and steel.
The increase in fixed capital spending now planned by manu-
facturers comes at a time when their capacity utilization rate was the
lowest in five years (83.6 per cent in the third quarter) and about 7
percentage points below the very high rate prevailing throughout 1966.
According to the McGraw-Hill survey, manufacturers as a group anticipate
a 6 per cent rise in the physical volume of their sales next year. The
rise in plant and equipment spending also may reflect efforts to reduce
unit output costs by modernizing productive facilities since wages are
continuing to increase more rapidly than costs of equipment.
Nonmanufacturing industries now plan to increase capital
spending in 1969 by 5.4 per cent. Mining and railroads anticipate
declines from this year, and the other major industries except airlines
(+13 per cent) are planning smaller gains than most manufacturing indus-
tries.
The McGraw-Hill fall surveys have generally indicated the
right direction of change in business fixed capital spending. However,
during periods of rapid economic expansion they have tended to under-
state the degree of increase, and in years of contraction they have
tended to understate the degree of decline.

II -22
Of the companies cooperating in the survey, 57 per cent (55
per cent of the manufacturing companies) reported their 1969 plans did
not take into account an expiration of the tax surcharge on corporate
and personal income taxes as scheduled on June 30, 1969. Presumably
the 43 per cent (45 per cent in manufacturing) would reconsider their
plans if the tax surcharge is extended.
Marriages. There has been a sharp upsurge in both the
number and rate of marriages this year. Several factors have been
responsible for this acceleration, but foremost has been the larger
numbers of persons reaching marriageable age. Sharply rising incomes
and the prospect of a further reduction in draft calls also may have
been contributing factors.
Data for the first eight months show an 8-1/2 per cent rise
in marriages from the comparable period of 1967. This was a sharp up-
surge from the 3.9 per cent average annual rate during the previous
five years. A continuation of the current rate for the remainder of
1968 would suggest a total of 2,075,000 marriages for the year as a
whole--the largest number since the 1946 peak of 2,291,000.

The age composition of the population has been the major factor
in the recent increase. One million more young persons reached age 21
this year than last--those born in 1947, the first year of the postwar
baby boom; they graduated from college in larger numbers than ever before;
and the tight job market and sharply rising wages and salaries offer a
strong economic base for marriage.
The stepped-up rate of increase in the number of young married
couples will be reflected in a rise in household formation, and some
increase is already evident over the past year. Net new household forma-
tion rose by 1.6 million from March 1967 to March 1968, about double the
recent annual increase--with half the rise in husband-wife households.
Year-to-year comparisons of these data are not very reliable but a yearly
rise well above the 840,000 average annual increase from 1962 to 1967 can
certainly be anticipated over the next few years and it could be as high
as the 1967-68 rise. Such a step-up in net new household formation should
bring substantial additional pressure for housing and related durable
household goods.

II -24
Personal income. Preliminary estimates of personal income
for October indicate a rise of $2.5 billion at annual rates, down by
more than half from the September increase of $5.6 billion. According
to these estimates, wage and salary payments rose only $1.4 billion in
October, after a September spurt of $4.1 billion and an average
monthly increase of $3.7 billion from January through September.
The preliminary October figures--which are subject to
revision--appear to be somewhat out of line with developments as
indicated by other comparable economic data. The small rise in income
came after a large increase in September. Such month-to-month
variations have not been too unusual. If data for the two months
are averaged, as in the table, the comparison with other recent two-
month periods suggests a more modest and reasonable easing in the
rate of income growth.

Labor market. Labor demands picked up somewhat last month
and the labor market entered the seasonally active holiday period of
late-November and December on a much firmer basis than had been
anticipated earlier. Unemployment has averaged 3.6 per cent in recent
months (including October) and is expected to continue at close to
this low rate for the remainder of the year. Claims filed for unemploy-
ment benefits in mid-November were well below year-ago levels and the
rate of insured unemployed as a proportion of covered workers was about
as low as at any time since the end of World War II.
Employment and labor force. Nonfarm payroll employment
adjusted for strike activity rose by 175,000 in October--a faster
pace than in other recent months. Renewed strength in manufacturing,
where employment had shown no growth from June through September, was
a significant factor in the October advance. The manufacturing increase
occurred largely in durables, specifically transportation equipment--
reflecting strong auto demand--and fabricated metal products.

Sizable employment gains also occurred in trade, State and
local government (about 50,000 each), and finance and services.
Federal employment continued to decline and in October was 94,000
below its June peak.
Labor force growth continued to slow down in October. At
78.8 million, seasonally adjusted, the civilian labor force was
unchanged from September and about 750,000 over October 1967--only
about half of the expected "normal" increase. The abrupt slowdown
in growth has been largely among adult men and women, with teenagers
showing about the expected growth. This kind of slowdown is
particularly unusual for adult men, whose work force participation
is generally high and firm.

Early in 1967, the overall labor force actually declined
between January and May, then rebounded sharply when activity picked
up in the summer and fall. This year's slowdown does not appear to
be linked to any perceptible changes in economic activity and may prove
to be a statistical aberration. If so, the household survey data

II -27
probably is understating both unemployment and employment; a comparison
with payroll employment data suggests that this may be the case with
respect to employment.
Hours and earnings. Average hours remained very high in
manufacturing, as they have through most of this year. Both overtime
and average weekly hours were 0.3 hour above the October 1967 level,
with the largest year-to-year increases in industries showing large
employment gains--namely, fabricated metals and transportation equip-
ment. Outside manufacturing, however, most industries reported a
lower workweek this month. Weekly hours in private nonfarm establish-
ments were down 0.2 hour, as average hours fell in construction, trade,
and mining.
Hourly earnings for private nonfarm workers rose to $2.92 in
October, an increase of 7.4 per cent over the year. Wage gains have
continued large in all industries, and even have shown a tendency to
increase over the course of the year. The gains are evident in union
and nonunion and high and low-wage industries. In the nonmanufacturing
industries, a tight labor market has increased competition for workers
forcing wage rates up, while the February increase in minimum
wages put a much higher floor under entry-level wage rates.
The rapid pick up in manufacturing wages has been the result of
a very heavy period of collective bargaining this year. Since new
contracts have emphasized very large first.year wage increases, hourly
earnings are showing unusually sizable over-the-year gains. Because
most major contract negotiations in this important bargaining round

II -28
are now completed, pressure on wages from first-year wage increases
(which have averaged about 7-1/2 per cent) will diminish, while
second and third year contract increases (which are expected to
average 4-1/2 per cent) will take on added weight.

Wage developments. With the October 14 settlement of the
coal industry contract, a major round of collective bargaining activity
came to an end. Although contracts covering an estimated 400,000
employees--including over 50,000 East and Gulf-coast longshoremen
who are working under a Taft-Hartley injunction until late December--
are up for renegotiation in the remainder of the year, the peak
bargaining period for 1968 was reached in the third quarter when con-
tracts covering 1.4 million workers were negotiated. Some 3.4 million
workers were covered by contract negotiations in the first nine months
of 1968, the largest number covered in a comparable period since 1960.

Third quarter collective bargaining settlements continued
the pattern established in the first half of the year. In terms of the
annual cost of the wage and fringe package, the settlements continued
the pattern of 6 to 6-1/2 per cent average annual increases established
in earlier settlements this year. Also continued was the high median

II -30
first-year increase for wages alone--7-1/2 per cent. However, wage
changes in the second and third years of these contracts have tended
to be in the neighborhood of 4-1/2 per cent, about the same as second
and third year wage increases negotiated in 1967 contracts.
Although the number of workers covered by reopening of
contracts on wages is relatively small in the fourth quarter, a sub-
stantial number will receive deferred increases. Approximately 800,000
auto and related workers will receive a 3 per cent productivity in-
crease and an 8 cent, or 2 per cent maximum cost-of-living adjustment
during the fourth quarter.
Consumer prices. The Consumer Price Index rose only 0.2
per cent in September--to 122.2 per cent of the 1957-59 average--as
compared with an average monthly increase of 0.4 per cent between May
and August. The relatively small rise in September, as well as the
fast increase over the preceding 3 months, stemmed in large part from
fluctuations in mortgage interest charges. These charges rose only
0.3 per cent in September after jumping 11 per cent between May and
August. Other factors in the September slowing were declines in
prices of foods and of new cars, both of which, however, were less
than expected seasonally.
Apart from the unusual impact of mortgage interest charges,
which have been a special phenomenon obscuring--in a sense--the under-
lying changes in consumer prices, service costs continued up at a

II -31
fast pace in September, although the rise for the third quarter as a
whole was below the near-record rate in the first half of the year.
Of as much significance, after allowing for usual seasonal changes,
was the sharp further rise in average retail prices of commodities in
September. New car prices showed only about half the usual large
seasonal decline and thus the seasonally adjusted index for autos
spurted after showing little change through most earlier months of
the year. Prices of appliances jumped. Retail apparel prices were
raised 1.7 per cent, twice the expected seasonal rise. Prices of food
at home declined less than seasonally, although for the third quarter
as a whole these prices, seasonally adjusted, averaged unchanged from
the second quarter.
On a seasonally adjusted basis, prices of both durable and
nondurable goods--but particularly durables--rose more in September
than had been allowed for in the third quarter estimates shown in the
table on page II-24 of the October 23 Green Book. Revised third
quarter changes in the adjusted "CPI" are shown below, along with the
revised implicit price deflator for personal consumption expenditures.
The rise in consumer prices apparently did slow down in the third
quarter--in large part because of the leveling off in food prices--but
the contrast between the "CP" indications and the implicit PCE deflators
is even more marked than a month ago.

Wholesale prices. Final BLS data for October (Confidential
until release November 27) show that the rise in prices of industrial
commodities rounded to 0.5 per cent, instead of 0.4 per cent as
estimated earlier. The major increases were for motor vehicles and
equipment (2.3 per cent), lumber and plywood (2.3 per cent), coal
(2.4 per cent--following the strike settlement), and footwear (1.9
per cent). The rise for motor vehicles and equipment alone accounted
for roughly half the increase in the industrial average.
While a few major items accounted for a very large part of
the industrial price rise in October, there were a spate of widely
scattered, small increases. The number of product classes showing
increases for the month totaled 121 (or 54 per cent), the highest

II -, 33
since last February. A pronounced decline in foods and foodstuffs
offset the industrial price rise in October, and the over-all-wholesale
price index, at 109.1 per cent of the 1957-59 average, was the same
as in September and also July.
The major industrial price development since mid-October has
been the cut of over 20 per cent in prices of hot-rolled steel sheet,
a product which accounts for about 11 per cent of total steel ship-
ments. The direct effect of this price reduction alone--if completely
effective in the BLS November index--will be to reverse most of the
average price rise of 2.3 per cent announced in August (and first
included in the September index). The August increase covered steel
products accounting for roughly 70 per cent of mill shipments and
added about 0.1 percentage point to the September industrial commodity
total. Whether this cut is a harbinger of general weakness in steel
prices--particularly for the closely related cold-rolled steel sheets--
or merely a one-shot effort to reverse the sharply rising trend of steel
imports, in one way or the other, may be revealed in coming weeks. It
does act in itself to slow the rise in average prices of industrial
commodities, which, through October, was accelerating.
Wholesale prices of industrial commodities have been
increasing since mid-year, following a number of months of little
change, and this pattern is broadly similar to the sequence of develop-
ments in the spring, summer and early autumn of 1967. The period of
stability in industrial prices was more protracted last year than

II -34
this year: the BLS industrial average was literally stable from
February to July 1967 whereas this year the index was stable only from
April to July. The resumption of an upward movement last year was
sparked initially by the large rubber wage settlement and price rise
around mid-July, and the industrial average showed a steady upward
movement to October (and subsequently on to last March). The re-
cent advance started much more slowly in August and then accelerated in
September and October. But the increase in the BLS industrial commodity
average from July to October was the same in both years--0.7 per cent.
In the recent period of stepped-up industrial price advance,
as well as in the corresponding period a year earlier, a few major
items have accounted for a very large share of the total advance.
From July to October this year, motor vehicles and equipment, lumber
and plywood, machinery and equipment, and steel mill products accounted
for over three-fourths of the advance in the industrial average.
From July to October last year, these four major items plus two
others, rubber products and nonferrous metals, accounted for over four-
fifths of the total advance.
While both of these periods were marked by a pronounced
impact of a relatively small number of sizable increases, both periods
were also characterized by a steadily widening diffusion of increases.
The sequence of the number of reported increases among the 225 four-
digit industrial commodity classes was asfollows during the two 3-month
periods:

Farm production and prices. Indexes of farm output based on
relatively firm November 1 estimates show 1968 total output to be 2.5
per cent above last year with both crop and livestock output larger
than in any other year. Record crops of wheat, rice, soybeans, and
peanuts more than offset smaller crops of corn and tobacco and total
crop was 2.6 per cent above last year. Cropland in production was
about 1 per cent less than a year earlier. Among livestock products,
expanding production of cattle and hogs this year more than offset
declines in production of poultry, eggs, and milk products.
Production prospects point to sagging prices for many farm
products in the coming marketing year. Supplies of food grains, feed
grains, and oilseeds are expected to exceed utilization, and harvest-time
prices are well below a year earlier and are close to loan rates. Feed
grain prices have strengthened a little but are not likely to stray
far from loan rates. Fruit prices will probably be forced down when
the marketing of the one-third larger citrus crop begins in December.
Meat animal prices also may sag in early 1969 if output of pork, beef,
and broilers increase as anticipated. Although the cotton crop is
again below utilization, prices are likely to show little change because
stocks are still large and the 1968 crop is of desirable quality and
staple. Tobacco prices may strengthen because of the smaller crop and
3 per cent higher price support.

Farm income. A little higher average farm prices and larger
volume of farm marketings are expected to boost realized net farm in-
come to around $15.0 billion in 1968 from $14.2 billion in 1967, according
to USDA. Strong consumer demand for livestock products, fruits and
vegetables, higher price supports for milk, and larger government
payments contributed to the gains in gross cash income. Partly off-
setting these gains were higher production costs and these are likely
to continue to rise in 1969.
In early 1969, realized net income is likely to drop from
current high levels to around the $14.6 billion annual rate of the
first half of 1968. The drop is expected because of rising costs, and- --

because of downward pressure on selling prices stemming from large
supplies of meats and broilers, big grain and soybean stocks, and
possibly, some easing in domestic demand. Price support loan programs
for the crops in surplus supply and the strong possibility that govern-
ment payments will be larger than in 1968 are expected to act as
stabilizing influences on farm income next year.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL SITUATION
Bank credit. Total loans and investments at all commercial
banks, on an end of month basis, continued to expand in October at about
the 15 per cent annual rate of the previous two months. Nearly two-
thirds of the October increase reflected further loan expansion, with
growth in business and real estate loans appreciably larger than in
September. While banks added relatively little to holdings of U.S.
Government securities, they continued to take other securities into
portfolio during October and early November at about the rapid pace
of recent months.

In spite of almost complete bank underwriting of a $3 billion
Treasury bill financing late in October, bank holdings of U.S. Government
securities changed relatively little over the month--largely the result
of bank sales of Treasury bills prior to the financing. This liquida-
tion of Treasury bills, which was resumed in early November, probably
reflects the high cost of funds, the relatively attractive yields on
municipals, and the sustained strength of loan demand.
Following some slowing earlier in the month, net bank acquisi-
tions of other securities rose rapidly in late October and early
November, bringing the October increase up to the rapid pace prevailing
since deposit inflows improved this summer. While the October rise
continued to be mainly in municipals and agency issues, it was concen-
trated more in longer-term securities at banks outside New York than
has been the case in recent months. New York banks, which have been
liquidating short-term municipals since the end of September, also
began to reduce holdings of longer term securities in early November.
The rate of growth in business loans rose somewhat in
October-- with virtually all of the increase taking place at banks
outside New York--after having slowed in recent months from the
rapid increase in July. However, the timing and the distribution
of the October increase do not suggest a resurgence of widespread
business borrowing at banks. While business loans expanded rapidly
during the first three weeks in October, they declined in the following
two weeks, and rose only somewhat more than normally in early November.
Moreover, the October increase was the result of expanded borrowing by
only a few industrial categories, principally retail trade, transporta-
tion equipment, construction, and services.

III -3
Growth in consumer loans continued at the increased pace
that has prevailed since around mid-year, reflecting principally--as
in recent months--the financing of a large volume of automobile sales.
Expansion in real estate loans accelerated further from the increased
pace of September, probably in response to the recent increase in
construction activity and the continued availability of funds at banks.
After having risen by nearly $4 billion over the third
quarter, security loans declined slightly in October as dealers reduced
their inventories, on average, from September. However, data for
New York banks suggests that security loans changed little, on balance,
at large banks during early November.
Bank deposits. Time and savings deposits at all commercial
banks, on a daily average basis, rose at a 17.7 per cent annual rate
in October--approximately the third quarter pace--although inflows
appear to have slowed somewhat late in the month and in early November.
As in recent months, much of the October increase represents further
additions by banks to their outstanding CD's. However, inflows of
consumer-type time and savings deposits held by State and local govern-
ments also increased rapidly, the latter--which took place mostly in
the San Francisco District--probably representing in large part the
temporary investment of funds obtained from the recent large volume of
municipal financing in California.

Although large banks added nearly $1.2 billion to their outstanding
CD's in the six weeks ending November 6, most of the expansion occurred
in the first half of October, with inflows slowing somewhat in subsequent
weeks. While this increase was about equally divided between New York
and outside banks, outstanding CD's at New York banks have shown virtually
no growth since mid-October. Major banks both in and outside of New
York have had to pay increasingly higher rates to attract CD funds.
Most banks apparently are now paying ceiling rates on maturities up to
six months and there are scattered reports of banks paying the 6-1/4 per
cent ceiling rate on maturities of six months and over.1967

Inflows of consumer-type time and savings deposits at weekly
reporting banks accelerated further in October, continuing the trend in
recent months of a steadily increasing rate of growth. However, unlike
past increases, October inflows were heavily concentrated at the first
of the month, showing successively smaller advances in the following
weeks. Nearly all of the October increase in savings deposits took
place in the San Francisco District during the first week of the month,
probably reflecting quarterly crediting of interest to existing deposits.
The expansion of time certificates and open accounts also was concen-
trated in the early part of the month and occurred primarily in the
New York and San Francisco Districts, where October inflows at S&L's
have been less than normal.
Following a rapid increase from the end of July through the
September tax date, bank liabilities to foreign branches have remained
relatively unchanged, on balance, since the end of September, generally
fluctuating around an average level of about $7.1 billion.
The money stock in October rose at approximately a 5 per cent
annual rate, slightly faster than the third quarter pace but less than
the 5.6 per cent rise over the past 12 months. The October expansion
reflects largely an increase in private demand deposits, in part a
response to the reduction in U.S. Government deposits following a build-
up of these deposits in the previous two months. Partial data suggests
that the November increase in the money stock may exceed that of
October, as U.S. Government deposits decline further.

III -6
Nonbank depositary intermediaries. The rate of savings
growth at thrift institutions increased slightly during October for
the third consecutive month. The increase was the result of larger
net inflows to savings and loan associations, as the rate at mutual
savings banks was about the same as in September.

Larger inflows to S&L's were generally nationwide. Two
noteworthy exceptions, however, were S&L's in the New York and San
Francisco Districts, where net savings inflows fell short of the year
earlier experience. In those districts, by contrast, inflows of
consumer-type time and savings deposits at commercial banks were much
larger than a year earlier. Reasons for this disparity are not clear;
it apparently was not caused by rate factors, since most institutions
in these districts offer ceiling rates which are higher for S&L's than

III -7
for commercial banks. There have been reports, however, of increased
commercial bank promotional activity.
The backlog of mortgage commitments at S&L's in October
continued large relative to cash flow-- even after allowance for the
July-August liquidity adjustments made in response to the relaxed
FHLBB regulation.- Though a temporary increase in the ratio of commit-
ments to cash flow may result from lengthening of commitment maturities,
persistence of the higher ratios implies that honoring these commitments
will require increased savings inflows, further reductions in recently
stable liquidity ratios, and/or increased borrowing--which has been
modest in recent months. The NHLBB has indicated willingness to advance
funds for mortgage acquisitions, and apparently has funds available
to implement this.
1/ Effective July 1968, the required ratio of cash and Government
holdings to share capital was reduced from 7 per cent to 6.5 per
cent. In response, the industry liquidity ratio declined from
10 per cent in June to 9.4 per cent in August, which represents
about $700 million diverted from liquid holdings. The 9.4 per
cent ratio currently is near the low reached during 1966.

* "Total cash flow" equals sum of gross mortgage return flows, plus
net savings, plus net changes in borrowings and in other liabilities
for the current month and the preceding two months. This total was
divided into total mortgage commitments outstanding (including the
stock of loans in process) to derive the above ratios. Computations
were based on data not seasonally adjusted. Insured savings and loan
associations account for 96 per cent of industry resources.
Similarly, the size of the mortgage commitment backlog relative
to recent cash flow at New York State savings banks implies an
expectation of increased inflows and/or reduced future investments in
corporate securities, liquidity reductions, or use of borrowed funds.
A recently-instituted data series of outstanding mortgage commitments
scheduled to mature within three months, when related to the total of
net savings inflows plus net mortgage return flows for the current
month and preceding two months, reveals a sharply tightened position

III -9
since April, From August 1967 through March 1968, these maturing
commitments represented only about half of the three-month funds
described above; from April through September, in contrast, these
commitments have equalled or exceeded three-month funds./
Mortgage market developments. Slight tightening in the
sensitive secondary mortgage market, which began in early October,
apparently continued through the first half of November. With returns
on other capital markets instruments remaining relatively high, yields
on FNMA's 6-month forward-purchase mortgage commitments rose slightly
in each of the three auctions held so far in November, as shown in
the table. During the same period, the interest of diversified investors
in purchasing home mortgages slackened somewhat, according to FNMA
field office opinions.
2/ Data on gross flows to New York State savings banks--or even net
return flows from corporate securities investments--are not avail-
able. Thus, the relationship of mortgage commitments to deposit
gains plus mortgage return flows presents an incomplete picture
of their commitment position. Corporate securities, which have
been such an important part of portfolio changes in the recent past,
could represent the safety valve for these banks, since securities
acquisitions could be limited sharply in favor of mortgages.
Indeed, during September, the entire savings bank industry reduced
sharply its net acquisitions of corporate securities, although
seasonal factors may have influenced this pattern,

During the entire month of October, FHA data now available
indicate that yields on home mortgages edged higher in the private
secondary market for Government underwritten loans, thus reversing a
3-month downturn. In the less volatile primary market for conventional
home mortgages, in contrast, interest rates declined for the first time
in a year and a half, but only slightly. The decline partly reflected
reductions within several Eastern states where rates had abruptly
increased earlier this year following upward revisions in usury ceilings.
Since returns on new issues of high grade corporate bonds rose
rather sharply in October, the gross yield spread favoring investment
in home mortgages deteriorated, as shown in the table. At around 80
basis points, it again became comparatively unattractive by standards
prevailing before 1965.

of 12 to 13 basis points in yield. Gross yield spread is
average mortgage return, before deducting servicing fees, minus
average yield on new issues of high grade corporate bonds.

III -12
Further improvement during October in the pace of net savings
inflows to thrift institutions helped to sustain lender willingness
to supply mortgage funds. The supply was adequate in nearly all major
areas to meet primary market demands for long-term home-mortgage credit
at high interest rates, according to both FHA and FNMA field reports.
However, some tightening was noted in a number of market areas toward
the end of the month.
Corporate and municipal bond markets. Yields on new corporate
bonds advanced significantly in the latest week shown on the yield table
to a level about equal to their recent high reached in mid-October.
But yields have advanced further in the last few days, with a Aaa-rated
South Central Bell Telephone issue reoffered to yield 6.85 per cent--
a record yield for a Bell issue and 60 basis points above a comparable
offering in August. Municipal bond yields continued upward from their
August lows, bringing the total advance in municipal yields since August
to one-half percentage point.

Various factors appear to have accounted for the recent upward
pressure on interest rate. Investors adopted a cautious approach as
the future course of interest rates became cloudy, and unsold bonds in
syndicate began to mount. Uncertainties attached to the Vietnam peace
negotiations, mixed economic statistics, and the course of monetary
policy contributed to this investor hesitancy. In addition, the
market was dampened by the announcement of two $150 million corporate
issues to be offered in November and December, as well as by the
prospective surge of industrial revenue bond offerings.
Flotations of corporate bonds in the public market are
expected to total about $850 million in November, significantly below
October but nearly equal to the monthly average during the third quarter.
While this estimate includes the $150 million Anaconda offering, the
bulk of the volume, nonetheless, continues to reflect a heavy calendar
of public utility issues. Including private placements, total bond
and stock offering in November are estimated at $1.6 billion, below
the recent monthly average of offerings due partly to a decline in
stock offerings.

Looking ahead to December, the calendar now contains $500
million of scheduled corporate bonds and this may ultimately build-
up to about $700 million. This would place the calendar for December
among the lowest this year. However, the volume is seasonally high
and concentrated in the first half of the month. Privately placed
bonds are expected to show a normal year-end jump and will likely
bring total corporate security offerings in December to $1.8 billion,
well below the outsized volume a year earlier but little changed
from the average volume of issues over this year.
In the municipal market, the estimated volume of offerings
for November has been reduced to $1.2 billion, placing November a
full $1 billion below the record-breaking volume in the month earlier.
Much of the downward revision reflects a slower than anticipated growthBond

III -15
in the calendar and some rescheduling of issues due to unfavorable
market conditions--a large overhang of unsold bonds and rising
interest rates. The estimated volume of issues in December is
currently $1.2 billion and allows for a sizeable volume of industrial
revenue issues, But since yields necessary to sell these industrial
revenue bonds currently exceed statutory interest rate ceilings in
some states, the ultimate volume of such issues before the year-
end cut-off date may be significantly influenced by the course of
interest rate.

Recent bond election results suggest that municipal offerings
in the future are likely to continue at a fast pace. Voters approved
a record $4.4 billion of bonds--$1 billion above the previous high set
in 1960. And this occurred with an acceptance ratio of less than one-
half of the proposed issues, a rate sharply below earlier years. In
California, voters defeated the "Watson Amendment" which would have
severely constrained local borrowing authority (part of the large
October volume contained California offerings that had been accelerated
to avoid this potential constraint.)
Stock market. The most recent advance in common stock prices,
which had begun in early August, lost momentun in late October and early
November. By mid-November, prices were still fluctuating around the
historic highs reached in the previous month, while trading volume--
after a brief moderation--had returned to the level registered during
the advance. Four-day trading weeks were extended through the end of
November as back-office problems continued.

Very preliminary figures for October indicate that margin
debt to brokers declined $90 million during the month to $6,300 million.
Since July, such debt has declined steadily, although stock prices
have risen; by the end of October, 22 per cent of the $1.8 billion
1967-68 increase had been erased. At large weekly-reporting commercial
banks, on the other hand, purpose loans to non-brokers continued to
advance to new highs in October. Such loans--which include those to
purchase bonds and over-the-counter securities as well as convertibles
and registered stock--expanded by $42 million during the month to a
total of $2,557 million.
Government securities market. With the exception of quotations
on shorter-term Treasury bills, which have declined on balance, yields
on U.S. Government securities have risen since the last meeting of
the Committee. Increases have been most pronounced on long-term bonds.

III -18
The yield on 3-month Treasury bills dropped 10 basis points to about
5.40 per cent at mid-November and, after edging higher again with the
deterioration in foreign exchange markets, has most recently
returned about to the 5.40 per cent level.

The further increase in Government security yields developed
despite the bombing halt in Vietnam and the outcome of the election.
Apparently in reality these events bred less confidence among market
participants of foreseeable cut-backs in Federal spending than they had
in prospect. With market participants also wondering whether hhe
persistent early November tightness of money signified a shift in policy,

III -19
some observers began to question whether earlier expectations of
significant general yield declines next year would necessarily be
realized outside of short-term markets--where the impact of heavy
Federal debt repayments will be centered. Most recently, the
resurgence of turmoil in foreign exchange markets has created further
market uncertainties about the likely course of policy, but these
have been eased somewhat by the more comfortable state of the money
market.
With investors and market professionals generally taking a
more cautious view of the future, Government security dealers moved
to reduce their holdings of longer-term notes and bonds. Dealers
emerged from the November Treasury refinancing with positions totaling
nearly $760 million in issues due after 5 years, and about $475 million
in other coupon issues. Since then, they have made fairly good progress
in distributing these holdings, reducing positions to about $650
million in longer-term issues and to $380 million in other coupon
issues. Of course, progress in distributing these holdings occurred
at some sacrifice in price.
As yields on longer maturity bills have risen in recent weeks,
spreads from yields on shorter maturities have widened. To some extent
this has reflected the modification of market expectations about future
interest rates, already noted, but in addition it has reflected
important temporary changes in immediate market demands for short-term
bills relative to the supply. In late October and early November
yields on short-bill maturities rose when demands for bills on swaps

II -20
out of "rights" to the Treasury refinancing proved to be smaller than
anticipated; in these circumstances, dealers became concerned about
the high cost of financing and moved to cut back positions. Subse-
quently, bill demands strengthened substantially--particularly from
foreign sources; dealer holdings of short-bill maturities became
quite scarce; and yields at the short end of the market were bid
sharply lower. Looking ahead dealers now face three successive
Treasury bill auctions at a time when demands for bills usually taper
off. The regular monthly and weekly bill auctions take place on
November 22 and 25, and the Treasury has just announced a further
auction of about $2 billion June tax bills for November 26.
Other short-term rates. Yields on other short-term obligations
have also moved upward on balance in recent weeks, as indicated in
the following table. Rates in commercial paper, finance company paper
and bankers' acceptances are all now around 1/8 of a percentage
point above the levels prevailing at the time of the last Committee
meeting.

Federal finance. The Budget Bureau is now forecasting a
Budget deficit of $3 billion for the current fiscal year, $2 billion
less than indicated in the Summer Budget Review. Although Federal
outlays, at $185 billion, are estimated to be $600 million larger
than in the Summer Review, the projection of Budget receipts has
been revised upward by $2.6 billion. The new estimate on spending
(whether calculated on a Budget or an NIA basis) is still about $1.5
billion smaller than the one projected by the Board staff in the
October chart presentation. In the absence of a cease-fire in Vietnam
very soon, however, the staff still believes its own estimate to be
more realistic.
The $2 billion tax bill financing, just announced will be
paid for on December 2. Its size is somewhat smaller than was
projected in the last green book, chiefly because the Treasury has
recently gained funds from other sources including certificate sales
to foreigners. Staff estimates now indicate that the Treasury will
end the calendar year with a cash operating balance of over $4 billion.
At mid-December prior to receipt of payments on quarterly corporate
income taxes, however, the operating balance would temporarily drop
much lower and this might require a Treasury overdraft at the Federal
Reserve for several days.

Recent developments in foreign exchange markets. Revival in
recent weeks of speculative buying of the German mark has created near-
chaotic conditions in exchange markets and has put increasing pressure on
the French franc and pound sterling. Heavy demand for the mark developed
on Wednesday, November 6, in response to rumors that the mark would be
revalued over the weekend. The speculative demand continued to build up
in the following fortnight, and so far this month the Bundesbank has
purchased about $2.9 billion in the spot exchange market to maintain the
current parity. In order to reduce the impact on its reserves the
Bundesbank has also been conducting swaps with German commercial banks --
selling U.S. dollars spot and purchasing them forward -- at a premium on
the forward mark below what the market rate would otherwise be. Through
noon November 15 (last Friday) it had done about $1.0 billion of swaps.
We should, however, guard against interpreting the $2.9 billion of spot
purchases of the Bundesbank as indicative of the size of the volume of
funds flowing to marks, since -- with the swaps going on -- it is likely
that part of the Bundesbank's gross spot transactions reflect repurchase
of dollars which it had previously sold under swaps. On November 15 the

IV -2
Bundesbank limited further swaps to 61-90 day maturities, at a 3.5 per
cent discount on dollars, and only for the placement of funds in U.S.
Treasury bills; since that time no further swap business has been done.
The impact of the mark speculation has been most severe on
the French franc. Selling pressure on the French franc accelerated con-
siderably in the week ended November 15 and still further this week.
The Bank of France has increased its drawings on its swap facilities with
the System and with European central banks, and has sold gold as well,
in order to finance its exchange sales. Since April 30 the Bank of France
has sold at a minimum $4.5 billion from the $7 billion of net reserves
(including IMF gold tranche position) it had at the end of April. Pub-
lished gross reserves do not reflect all this loss, because of the financ-
ing of exchange sales by over $1 billion of central bank credits and at
least $300 million of swaps with French commercial banks.
Until about a week ago the current wave of mark speculation
had not had much impact on sterling. However, starting on Wednesday,
November 13 the demand for sterling began to weaken when the October trade
figures showed a somewhat larger seasonally adjusted deficit than in
September. The Bank of England lost large amounts of net reserves in
moderating the decline in the sterling exchange rate from about $2.3900
on November 8 to its low of $2.3827 per pound on November 19.
There has been little evidence in the exchange markets of
speculative reactions directly adverse for the position of the dollar.
The tightening in the Euro-dollar market in October and November, how-
ever, is probably related to the increased tendency for liquid capital
flows in Europe to go toward the mark rather than the dollar.

IV -3
Actions taken this week to deal with the international ex-
change market crisis will be summarized in a supplement to this Green
Book.
Financial markets in major industrial countries. Since
about the end of September, interest rates in many countries have
stopped declining. Previously, short-term rates had generally been
easing off after midyear. That tendency has continued in Japan, but
in most other countries short-term rates in October and early November
were either level or rising seasonally. More pronounced changes have
occurred in France, where the authorities have sought to stem losses
of official reserves by raising short-term interest rates and -- in
the past two weeks -- by taking strong measures to restrain bank credit
expansion. Euro-dollar rates, too, have risen sharply -- by a full
percentage point for maturities of 3 months or less -- since the latter
part of September.
Long-term rates have been stable since midyear in Britain,
Switzerland, and the Netherlands, and have moved down in Japan. On the
other hand, the advance in German economic activity together with heavy
U.S. and other foreign demands on the German capital market brought an
end, two months ago, to the long downtrend in German long-term yields.
In Canada, the May-to-September decline in long-term yields was sharply
reversed in October-November.
The French authorities have to some extent shifted their eco-
nomic priorities, adopting stronger measures in the past two weeks to
bolster the external position of the franc at the risk of slowing down
the rapid rise of domestic economic activity.

IV -6
Earlier, a progressive tightening of the Paris money market
raised the call money rate from 6 per cent in early September to about
8 per cent by mid-October. This action was taken in the light of the
prospective large deficit in the current account of the balance of pay-
ments and the enlarged reserve losses after the removal of exchange
controls in France on September 4 -- losses that were accentuated by
speculation on a German mark revaluation. In addition to raising the
rate at which it lends to the money market, the Bank of France employed
for a while a new technique of making available, through its money market
operations, only a part of the amount of funds applied for daily by each
discount house at the rate set by the Bank.
In the latter half of October money market rates were allowed
to recede, but they were raised again early in November when renewed
speculation on the German mark increased the pressure on the franc in
the exchange market. From September 5 to November 15, the rate on
1-year Treasury bills -- the principal instrument used in financing the
mounting budget deficit -- rose on balance by more than 2 percentage
points, while yields on long-term bonds showed very little change. On
November 8 the call money rate on private paper was 7.25 per cent.
On November 13, the Bank of France increased its discount rate
from 5 per cent to 6 per cent -- primarily for psychological reasons --
and at the same time announced measures to limit the expansion of bank
credit. Most important was the imposition of a ceiling on short-term
bank credit. Expansion of such credit from the end of September to the
year end (not seasonally adjusted) is not to exceed 4 per cent.

IV -7
Supporting this direct control, cash reserve requirements
were increased, as was also the proportion of medium-term paper which
banks must retain in their portfolios and so cannot rediscount. Earlier,
ordinary rediscount quotas (from which approved medium-term paper is
exempt) had been cut back on October 20 to their pre-June 20 levels,
and special rediscount privileges for paper of small firms had been
terminated at the end of October. All these measures reduce the liquidity
of the banking system and have the effect of forcing the banks, in order
to meet their cash reserve requirements, into the very narrow Paris money
market, where the Bank of France can make borrowing very expensive for
them. On November 15 the Bank's intervention rate was 7-5/8 per cent,
but it was again limiting its assistance and some market borrowing was
done at rates over 9 per cent.
In Germany, bond yields stopped declining in September, and
would probably have moved up in subsequent weeks had not the Bundesbank
resumed its support purchases of public authority bonds. Bundesbank
purchases from September 24 through October 31 totaled DM 250 million,
of which DM 101 million were made in the last week of October. Earlier,
from mid-July to mid-August, the Bundesbank had been able to sell off
some of its previous bond acquisitions. The average yield on 6 per cent
public authority bonds has been at 6.21 per cent throughout October and
early November.
A major component of the enlarged capital outflow which has
offset much of Germany's current account surplus in 1968 has been the
purchases of new foreign securities. Gross new bond issues by foreign

IV -8
borrowers in Germany were DM 4.1 billion ($1.0 billion) in the first
three quarters of the year, up from DM 0.5 billion a year earlier, and
were especially large in the third quarter, amounting to DM 2.1 billion.
Much of these bonds have gone into German bank portfolios.
On November 4 the German Capital Market Committee subjected
new bond issues of foreign borrowers to the same scheduling requirements
as govern flotations by domestic issuers. Although the increasing volume
of foreign issues was undoubtedly a factor tending to tighten the bond
market, the purpose of applying the scheduling requirements to them was
merely to prevent any undesired bunching rather than to reduce foreign
access to the German capital market. In reflection of the German authori-
ties' desire that Germany continue to be a net capital exporter, an
Economics Ministry official recently warned German banks not to raise
interest rates on loans or deposits, stating that a DM revaluation would
be unavoidable if the capital outflow were not maintained.
The renewed speculative demand for marks this month has re-
flected widespread discussion -- notably in the European financial press --
of the large German trade surplus and of the precarious nature of the
balance of payments offset via capital outflows, at a time when pressures
on the resources of the German economy are growing.
Up to now there has been no turn toward active tightening of
monetary policy in Germany, and changes in short-term rates since August
have mainly reflected seasonal influences. For example, the rise of 1-3/8
percentage points in the 3-month interbank loan rate at the beginning of
October was seasonal, in anticipation of year-end window dressing. Since

IV -9
about November 12, however, day-to-day money rates have fallen unusually
low as the result of the influx of foreign money.
Elsewhere on the European continent, in October and early
November short-term rates were moving up in Switzerland (seasonally), in
the Netherlands, and in Belgium. The Belgian money market reportedly was
tightened by shifts of bank funds to the Euro-currency markets. In con-
trasts, Sweden reduced its discount rate from 5-1/2 per cent on October 11,
thereby restoring the bank loan and deposit rate structure existing before
the emergency 1-point increase made at the time of last December's ex-
change crisis. The Swedish economy has not shown the energetic revival
that was expected earlier this year; nevertheless, the monetary authori-
ties have not taken aggressive steps in the direction of ease.
In Italy, the composite bond yield dipped a bit in July and
August, the first decline in about 18 months, but held steady in September.
Through July, new bond issues continued to run far ahead of the 1967 rate,
rising to the equivalent of $3.2 billion (net of redemptions) for the
first seven months compared with $2.0 billion a year before. Most of the
increase has been in Treasury bond flotations to finance a much-expanded
cash deficit on budgetary operations.
Italian commercial banks increased their net external assets
in foreign currency by $400 million in June-September, while reducing their
foreign-currency loans to domestic borrowers in those months. However,
loan demand has continued to rise in Italy, and lira loans increased in
this period by more than the reduction in foreign-currency loans.
Short-term interest rates in Britain continued to decline in
September and part of October, the 3-month bill yield dropping to the

IV -10
neighborhood of 6-1/2 per cent compared with 7 per cent or more through-
out the first half of this year. The fall in short-term rates after
June was partly in anticipation of a Bank rate reduction. The eventual
cut in the Bank of England's discount rate from 7-1/2 to 7 per cent on
September 19 was timed to follow news of the Basle sterling balance
financing arrangement and the August trade improvement. The narrowing
of the forward discount on sterling from early September until last week
served to keep the covered rate differentials against Euro-dollars from
becoming more unfavorable to sterling placements.
Accumulating evidence that, despite the restriction of bank
loan growth, consumer demand had been stronger than expected led to a
stiffening of consumer credit regulations effective November 1. On
automobiles, for example, the minimum down-payment was increased from
33-1/3 to 40 per cent and the maximum term was shortened from 27 to 24
months.
To aid the balance of payments, on October 11 the Bank of
England forbade sterling financing of trade between third countries
(outside the sterling area) and gave banks until November 25 to call
outstanding loans, currently estimated at £120 million. This will result
in a one-time reserve gain of that amount.
Bond yields in Britain have been almost unchanged since July,
remaining at high levels that are without precedent in recent times.
The tone of Canadian financial markets changed quite abruptly
in September, following the rather steep declines in both short- and
long-term rates in June-August. Yields on long-term government bonds
rose in September and early October nearly to the peak levels of last

IV -11
May, while the Treasury bill yield failed to decline further after
August. The main influences on Canadian rates were probably the up-
turns in short- and long-term rates in the United States after end-July.
However, trends in Canadian rates have also been affected by domestic
liquidity changes influenced by the balance of payments: the August-
October rates of increase in bank reserves and in the money supply
were only about one-half as large as those in May-July, when Canadian
official external reserves were increasing more rapidly than in the more
recent period.
The revised budget estimates presented to Parliament on
October 22 show a much larger deficit for the current fiscal year (end-
ing next March 31) than had been expected. This has increased the
likelihood the government will borrow again in the long-term capital
market before the end of this calendar year -- unless the autumn Canada
Savings Bond campaign proves very successful. The government was last
in the capital market in October, when it sold Can. $535 million gross
to raise Can. $275 million of new funds.
Since August 7, when the Bank of Japan reduced its discount
rate from 6.21 per cent to 5.84 per cent, the average interest rate
charged by commercial banks on loans and discounts has tended to decline.
Money market rates have fallen considerably from the highs reached around
midyear. The rate for call loans repayble on one day's notice fell from
8.40 per cent before August 7 to 7.30 per cent by November 1. Yields
on bonds were also declining after June, the yield on the Nippon Telegraph
and Telephone bonds dropping from 8.83 per cent in June to 8.03 per cent
in August. (Later data are not available.)

IV -12
In view of many indications that the pace of expansion in
Japanese economic activity has quickened again after the brief period
of pause last winter, the Bank of Japan has decided against a further
reduction in the discount rate at this time. In a somewhat unusual
step, Governor Usami announced on October 23 that the discount rate
would not be reduced in the near future.

IV -13
U.S. balance of payments. The balance of payments results
for the third quarter have now been published, but still with many
important components missing. Several elements point to improvements
in the underlying situation during that period. Most evident is the
gain in the trade balance, though the annual rate of $1.0 billion
(balance of payments basis) remains very weak and, as discussed below,
probably would have been lower if not for the effects of a dock strike
threat. Gains in those accounts for which data are not yet available
can only be inferred, but these missing elements had accounted for
average net payments (seasonally adjusted) of $750 million per quarter
in the first half of 1968, and they dropped to an insignificant amount
in the third quarter. Prominent in this collection of missing elements,
which appear to have been especially favorable in July, are direct in-
vestment capital flows and income, short-term corporate capital, and
services, including tourism. It seems reasonable to assume that much
of the improvement in the third quarter reflected a smaller outflow of
U.S. funds for direct investment -- which was expected in view of the
large amounts of funds available out of foreign borrowings -- together
with larger income returns. It is more doubtful that there were sig-
nificant gains in the other still-unknown categories, which are less
volatile.
Receipts under various arrangements between the U.S.
Government and foreign governments (primarily Canada and Germany)
to help in financing the U.S. balance were about $580 million in

IV -14
the third quarter, compared to $840 million in the second and $350 mil-
lion in the first. Thus the moderate gain in the liquidity balance from
the second to the third quarters occurred in spite of a reduction in these
receipts, although they remaind very large.
Financing the U.S. balance of international transactions was
accomplished with relative ease in the third quarter. There was no
pressure on reserves, and even some increase in the gold stock through
French sales to the United States. Foreign monetary authorities'
holdings of claims on the United States increased by nearly $500 mil-
lion, but the increase largely took the form of issues of special
Treasury securities and additions to over-one-year time deposits.
U.S. banks added nearly $1 billion to their liabilities to foreign
commercial banks, mainly their branches in the Euro-dollar market,
which was being fed by outflows from France.
As the fourth quarter opened,the October figures on the
liquidity basis began to add up to a substantial deficit, even after
taking into account the fact that October is seasonally an unfavorable
month. Moreover, the figures for the first two weeks of November
showed a further sizable deficit. October probably also showed a
deficit on the official settlements basis, as there was probably
only a small change in total U.S. liabilities to commercial banks
and other private foreign accounts.
Very little is known at this stage about the components of
our international transactions in October. Merchandise trade data

IV -15
are not available, but various indirect sources suggest that the trade
balance was down from the September amount. Capital outflows to purchase
new issues of the World Bank were large in October, and sales of
Canadian issues were substantial in November. Transactions for official
foreign accounts in October involved primarily a $125 million receipt
under the German offset agreement, whereas in September receipts from
foreign monetary authorities had totalled $405 million, including $250
million invested by Canada in U.S. Treasury non-liquid securities and
$135 million placed in long-term deposits by a few countries in Asia
and by Argentina. Sizable receipts from foreign reserve holders for
investments in non-liquid claims on the U.S. are projected for the rest
of the year, including a $100 million purchase by Japan of Export-Import
Bank certificates on November 15.
U.S. foreign trade. With a greater increase in exports than
in imports, the U.S. export surplus in the third quarter expanded sharply
to an annual rate of $1.1 billion (balance of payments basis), compared
with less than a $100 million rate in the first half of this year. It
is believed that a considerable portion of this improvement -- perhaps
as much as one-half -- stemmed from the acceleration in shipments in
anticipation of the longshoremen's strike at East and Gulf Coast ports
on October 1, which was greater for exports than imports. Although
October trade data are not available there are some indications of a
considerable drop in both exports and imports in October.

Exports in the third quarter advanced sharply to an annual rate of
$35.4 billion (balance of payments basis). This was 9 per cent higher than
in the first half of the year, which in turn was 7.5 per cent greater than
in the second half of 1967. The apparent acceleration of growth beyond a
15 per cent annual rate was perhaps largely an effect of the strike threat.
A commodity breakdown of the third quarter advance (without ad-
justment for the strike effects) indicates widespread strength in export
demands. More than three-fourths of the increase over the first half year
average was in machinery, chemicals, other industrial materials and con-
sumer goods. Earlier, much of the strength had been concentrated in
aircraft, automotive equipment to Canada, and refined copper (after the
end of a nine-month copper strike in April). Shipments of agricultural
products rose from the relatively low level of the second quarter, but
remained below those of the first quarter.

IV -17
The area composition of export gains has also shifted. In
the third quarter more than half the rise over the first half was in
shipments to Western Europe, mainly to the EEC countries but also to
the U.K., Sweden and Switzerland. These countries had accounted for
only about 10 per cent of the export expansion from the latter half
of 1967 to the first six months of 1968. The advance was probably
inflated, however, by some postponement of purchases from the second
to the third quarter to get the benefit of lower rates of duty with
implementation of the first 40 per cent of the Kennedy Round of
tariff negotiations on July 1. Sales to Japan continued to grow
at about the same rate as in the first half of the year. Shipments
to Canada, Latin America and Asian and African countries (excluding
South Africa) increased further but at a slower pace than earlier,
and there was no further increase in exports to Australia, New Zealand
and South Africa.
U.S. share of world markets. While U.S. exports have been
rising this year, there has been an equally large increase in exports
by other countries. Consequently the U.S. share of world exports
(excluding those to the U.S.) in the first half of 1968 (the latest
period for which data are available) was about the same as in the
corresponding period of 1967. In finished manufactures we had about
24 per cent of total trade in the first six months of this year, a
somewhat higher proportion than in the year earlier period. This
improvement was attributable largely to chemicals, aircraft and
cars to Canada.

IV -18
In the first six months of this year, the United States
supplied about 10.5 per cent of total imports of the European OECD
countries, a slightly smaller share than in the first half of 1967
and about one percentage point below that of 1964. A downtrend was
particularly evident in our share of shipments to Germany and France,
and our share of Japanese imports continued to drift downward. The
United States strengthened its position in Canada, accounting for
nearly 75 per cent of that country's total imports in the first half
of this year.
Imports in the third quarter continued to expand but at a
slower rate than in the first half -- an annual rate of 15 per cent
compared to 36 per cent. A very preliminary adjustment for the
effects of the threatened October dock strike would reduce the import
growth rate in the third quarter to about 12 per cent.
All major categories of imports displayed a slowing rate
of increase in the third quarter, except foodstuffs. The sharp rise
in coffee and whisky imports can be attributed to the threatened dock
strike. Higher U.S. prices stimulated increased imports of fish and
meat.
Imports of industrial materials other than copper and steel
rose at an annual rate of only 3 per cent in the third quarter, much
slower than the 25 per cent rate of advance in the first six months.
Copper imports fell while those of steel advanced further but the

rate of increase was more moderate than in the first half. Decreased
purchases of other metals and newsprint offset increases in imports of
petroleum, textile fabrics and building materials.
Sales to consumers of foreign cars (other than from Canada)
expanded faster than total sales here, raising their share of the do-
mestic market to 11.5 per cent, compared with 10.5 per cent in the
first half. Imports of cars from Canada rose less rapidly than before.
Trade balance shifts. The magnitude and direction of our
trade balance (on a balance of payments basis) with various areas
changed considerably this year with the greater growth in imports
than in exports. Our export balance has increased only with Latin
America. The customary surplus with Canada had moved into deficit
in the fourth quarter of 1967, and this increased to over $3/4 billion
at an annual rate in the first nine months of this year. Our export
balance with Western Europe this year through September has contracted
sharply to less than 15 per cent of the $1.8 billion surplus rate in
the corresponding period of 1967. Part of this shift was in our trade
with Britain as imports from that country rose sharply. The trade
deficit with Japan so far this year has increased to an annual rate
of $1 billion, three times as large as in the same months of 1967.
