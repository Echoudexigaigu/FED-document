SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK
Outlook for economic activity
A wide range of economic information becoming available in
recent weeks points to significantly stronger GNP growth in this and
the following quarter than was projected earlier. Impressive has
been the strength in business plant and equipment spending plans, the
continuing strength and upward revision in employment data, the sharp
further drop in the unemployment rate last month, and the resumed
upward thrust in retail sales in November. As a result, real GNP
growth in this quarter is now estimated at a 4-1/3 per cent annual
rate--only a little less than in the third quarter. (GNP growth this
quarter could well be even larger than this, particularly since pre-
liminary data--just received--on trade inventory accumulation for
October indicate a much sharper increase than allowed for in the staff
projection for the fourth quarter as a whole.)
Assuming that the October inventory figure does not signal
a continued excessive build-up in stocks--only to be followed by a
sharp inventory adjustment early next year--GNP growth in the first
quarter is projected at around a 3 per cent rate, with prospects still
for a further slowing in expansion next spring.
The pickup in business capital spending is projected to carry
over strongly into the first quarter of next year, but a slowing is now
scheduled for the second quarter. Also, an increase in social security
taxes in January and large payments on 1968 tax liabilities in both

I- 2
the first and second quarters are expected to dampen the rise of
spendable income, which in turn may reduce the rate of growth of
consumption somewhat further. The fourth quarter moderation in
consumption growth mainly reflects reduced purchases of automobiles and
some other durables, with nondurable goods demands thus far continuing
strong.
Only modest further stimulus is anticipated from other sectors
of demand in the first half of next year. Little further growth in
residential construction from current advanced levels is anticipated,
reflecting recent tightening in mortgage markets. Increases in Federal
expenditures have already shown signs of moderating and they may level
off after the first quarter. After a series of deficits rising to
over $10 billion annual rate in the second quarter of this year, Federal
expenditures are expected to be about in balance with receipts by
the year's end, and the budget (NIA basis) may show a surplus early
next year.
Outlook for prices and resource use.
Sustained consumer demands and an apparent resurgence in
business investment demands have brought a steady rise in industrial
production since August. The rise has not been large enough to make
any appreciable dent in the sizable margin of unutilized manufacturing
capacity and production expansion from here on is likely to lag some-
what the further rise in capacity, Nevertheless, investment spending
appears to be accelerating, partly in response to heightened inflation-
ary expectations and the pressure of the continued rise in labor costs.

I- 3
Employment gains in nonmanufacturing activities continue
strong; even in manufacturing a moderate upturn developed in October
and November following several months of stability. The unemployment
rate dipped to 3.3 per cent in November, with the rate for adult males
down to only 2 per cent. A moderate rise in unemployment is projected
in the first half of 1969, but the rate is likely to remain below 4 per
cent. Tightness in the labor market should lead to continuing strong
upward pressures on labor costs, although the smaller second year wage
increases scheduled in many labor contracts should be a moderating
factor.
The consumer price index rose sharply in October after in-
creasing moderately for two months. Although the October rise partly
reflected a temporary bulge in food prices and an increase for autos at
the beginning of the model year, retail prices of most industrial
commodities and of services have been rising at a fast pace this fall.
At wholesale, the price of a major steel product was cut sharply in
early November but this has since been mostly rescinded; apart from
steel, the rise in industrial prices is persisting, although at a some-
what slower pace than in early autumn. The moderate easing of demand
pressures projected for the first half of 1969 should result in some
slowing of the advance in the general price level.
Credit demand outlook
Business Idans at banks are expected to show a large rise in
December following the sharp spurt in November. The December expansion
will reflect in part the substantially increased level of tax and

I-4
dividend payments this year compared with a year ago. Thereafter, loan
demands are likely to moderate. There are some factors in prospect
which could keep demand to the sizable side. The recently announced
step-up in planned plant and equipment expenditures implies increased
working capital requirements in several supplying sectors. And if the
rate of business inventory accumulation in the early months of 1969
continues close to fourth quarter levels, this would tend to sustain
demands for bank credit. On the other hand, business short-term credit
demands could contract markedly early next year should there be an
excessive inventory build-up in late 1968 and a consequent sharp in-
ventory readjustment in early 1969.
With the latest economic projection implying a widening gap
between internally generated funds of corporations and their capital
outlays, business credit demands are also likely to lead to a con-
tinued fairly large volume of capital market financing. The recent
record level of bond yields has led to some postponements, which have
reduced the December calendar to a relatively low level. But a
snapback in the volume of offerings is anticipated for early next year.
Moreover, it is possible that corporations may tend to over-finance
early next year relative to needs in order to accumulate funds so as
to avoid a sharp liquidity squeeze in the second quarter when tax
payments reach a seasonal peak. This would be an especially likely
development should businesses begin to have stronger doubts about
the future availability of bank credit.

I-5
The volume of offerings is likely to remain large in the
municipal market in early 1969, but below the peak months of 1968.
While the continued rise in capital outlays and the financing of some
very large special projects will maintain the volume of offerings, the
calendar will no longer be enlarged by industrial revenue financing.
Further interest rate pressures--particularly if banks reduce their net
purchases of tax-exempts--could produce concellations of new issues, thus
marginally reducing the volume of new financing.
Assuming that the new Federal budget to be published in early
January indicates relatively small Federal financing needs, capital
market yields could back away from their peaks, although credit
demands from State and local governments and businesses may be large
enough to keep any such declines to modest proportions. However, a
more restrictive monetary policy has probably not been completely
discounted by the market, and could, if it developed, lead to further
upward interest rate pressures in the short run.
Outlook for supply of funds
Net inflows of time and savings deposits to banks and thrift
institutions are likely to be reduced more than usually asa result of
withdrawals around the mid-December tax period and the year-end interest-
crediting period. With the latest CD maturity survey showing December
maturities at a new high of $6.5 billion, a large CD run-off is antici-
pated, given current relatively high market interest rates that leave
CD's little or no margin of competitiveness except for funds of a

I -6
local nature or from regular customers. Whether these losses can be
recouped in early 1969--when maturities are also heavy--will, of
course, depend on interest rate developments. As of now, it would
appear that banks' progress in that respect would be relatively slow,
even assuming some abatement of short-term market interest rate
pressures.
Inflows of consumer-type time and savings deposits at commer-
cial banks have continued relatively strong, despite the relatively high
interest rates on market instruments. It is expected, however, that
some withdrawals may be made during the interest-crediting period to
take advantage of attractive market opportunities. Moreover, there
may be reduced net inflows early next year in conjunction with the
projected further decline in personal savings.
Demand deposit growth is not expected to be an exceptionally
large source of funds to banks in the early part of next year. Growth
in transactions needs for such deposits by businesses and consumers are
expected to moderate. However, there might be some tendency for
corporations and investment institutions to build up demand balances--
as well as interest-bearing liquidity instruments--for precautionary
reasons, should credit markets show indications of further tightening.
U.S. Government demand deposits are not likely to expand sharply,
although at some point in the first quarter of 1969 the Treasury
may have to raise $1.5 -$2.5 billion of new cash, possibly through
a financing payable in tax and loan accounts.

I- 7
While net savings inflows to nonbank thrift institutions in
the fourth quarter may be somewhat above the 6 per cent annual rate of
growth that prevailed in the first nine months of 1968, the current
level of market yields should lead to an enlargement of withdrawals
over the interest-crediting period. Recent comments from California
savings and loan associations suggest that such developments may
already be in progress.
With the level of mortgage commitments of thrift institutions
already unusually high relative to inflows, some cut-back in new commit-
ment volume is to be expected; the cut-back might be quite large since
net savings inflows to the institutions seem likely to fall below
earlier optimistic expectations. Given the recent rise in bond yields,
these considerations suggest that returns on mortgages may be under
further upward pressure in the period ahead.

International Developments
The underlying trend in U.S. trade and other current transactions
in coming months is still expected to be one of modest improvement, but
recent evidences of strong domestic demand suggest that we may have to
raise the projection of imports. Merchandise trade figures for October
show that much of the improvement in the trade balance in the third
quarter reflected the temporary effects of anticipation of the October 1
port strike. For the July-October period, the trade surplus was at an
annual rate of only $1/2 billion--marginally better than during the
first half year but still far below the $3-1/2 billion rate for all of
1967. With the Taft-Hartley injunction against the port strike scheduled
to expire on December 20, further distortions in monthly trade figures
are to be expected.
The measures recently taken by Germany, Britain, and France to
affect their foreign trade positions seem unlikely to have significant
net effects on U.S. trade with those countries, although the German
measures may help to arrest the deterioration of our competitive position
vis-a-vis German products in third markets.
After a brief respite at the end of November during which some
speculative positions were unwound, foreign exchange markets have again
become unsettled, with sterling weak and the German mark strong. The
measures cannot quickly alleviate the underlying causes of unease,
which include the persistence of the large German trade surplus despite
the domestic German boom, the disappointingly high level of U.K. imports,

I-9
the pressing need for rescheduling of British short-term official debt,
and the social and economic difficulties with which France is wrestling.
If new exchange market crises occur in the months ahead, the dollar may
prove more vulnerable than it appeared to be during the November 1968
crisis. A substantial U.S. payments deficit on the official reserve
transactions basis of calculation had already re-emerged in the past
two months, as inflows of foreign liquid funds through the Euro-dollar
market subsided. However, private and official transactions of
relatively transient kinds in December may serve to hold down the
fourth-quarter deficit on both bases, and particularly on the liquidity
basis.

THE ECONOMIC PICTURE IN DETAIL
The Nonfinancial Scene
Gross national product. Little moderation has been observed
in the momentum of economic activity, with the pace of expansion continu-
ing excessively rapid. The fourth quarter increase in GNP in current
dollars will probably equal the $18 billion gain of the third quarter,
although with prices rising more rapidly, the rate of growth in real
GNP may dip slightly, from 5 per cent to 4.3 per cent. (GNP growth in
this quarter could well be even larger than this if the sharp spurt in
trade inventories in October--just received--signals a much higher rate
of inventory accumulation than now projected for the quarter.)
The major factor responsible for the stronger fourth quarter
picture than had been expected as recently as three weeks ago is the
outlook for a resurgence in fixed capital spending by business, as
reported by the recently released Commerce-SEC survey of intentions to
invest in plant and equipment. An upward trend in orders for machinery
and equipment since mid-year appears to confirm the new higher spending
plans, which may reflect in part heightened inflationary expectations
associated with recent and anticipated price advances. The Commerce-SEC
survey indicates an increase of $7.7 billion, annual rate, in expendi-
tures between the third quarter of 1968 and the first quarter of 1969,
followed--surprisingly--by a dip in spending in the second quarter.
Actual outlays in the third quarter of this year (and the previous

quarter as well) fell well below previous expectations, however, and
it seems possible that progress in installing the projected new
capacity also could be slower than anticipated in the new survey, and
the rise may be stretched out over a longer period. In our projec-
tions, we have smoothed the projected pattern somewhat, assuming a
continuing shortfall in realization of plans in this and the next
quarter, but a further rise in the spring of next year (instead of the
decline shown in the survey) as actual spending catches up with plans.
Overall activity this quarter apparently has also been
supported by the rise in residential construction expenditures, which
followed the summer pickup in new housing starts. Starts may again
exceed an annual rate of 1.5 million units this quarter, despite some
recent tightening in mortgage markets, but residential construction
activity is likely to show little further increase during the first
half of next year because of limited availability of funds. (It
should be noted that this projection assumes continuation of about the
prevailing complex of credit conditions, and does not assume a
significant contraction in the availability of mortgage funds.)
Consumer expenditures are running slightly higher than
previously expected, but the increase for the current quarter is still
likely to average substantially less than in the third quarter. Unit
sales of new cars have been slightly lower than in the third quarter,
Sales of household durables also appear less strong, but nondurable
goods sales continue to rise, with price increases for apparel and
food helping to push up expenditures. In total, consumer expenditures

II -3
appear likely to be up by about $10 billion in this quarter. The rise
in personal income is likely to be slower than earlier this year, but
the recent upward revision of employment estimates in October as well
as greater-than-expected exuberance in the economy suggest that income
gains will be larger than we had expected last month.
Strength in consumption is expected to diminish further
early next year. Disposable income growth will be curbed in the first
half of 1969 by two factors--a somewhat slower rise in personal income
and a sharp increase in tax payments. Final payments on 1968 income
taxes in the first half of 1969 are expected to run unusually large in
view of the fact that the surcharge took effect in April-July but
withholdings were not raised until July. These additional tax payments
are likely to amount to about $2 billion in the first quarter and $4
billion in the second, at annual rates. There is also a further in-
crease of about $1.5 billion, annual rate, in the social security tax
effective January 1, 1969; together these cut the increase in dis-
posable income by about $3.5 billion in the first quarter and $5.5
billion in the second quarter of next year.
Although consumers may allow their rate of saving to drop
somewhat further with a lessened rise of after-tax income next year,
a cut as sharp as in the third quarter of this year seems unlikely.
Therefore, slower growth in after-tax incomes should be reflected in less
buoyant consumer markets. Purchases of durables are likely to level
off, or even decline somewhat. In addition, a slower advance in non-
durables goods purchases seems likely, reflecting in part a projected
lowering of food prices.

II -4
Federal expenditures for goods and services are apparently
continuing to show smaller rises, although information is complete
only for October. CCC purchases of farm commodities are expected to
continue to rise through the winter months, along with a small increase
in defense.
The sharp increase in Federal income tax receipts in the
second half of this year combined with the hold-down in outlays resulted
in a reduction in the NIA deficit from an annual rate of over $10
billion in the second quarter to an estimated half billion dollars in
the fourth. The Federal Government is expected to move into surplus in
the first quarter of next year and increase the rate of surplus in the
second quarter.
With continued strong demands, inventory accumulation is
shown to remain at about the third quarter rate through the first
quarter of next year. Some unintended buildup may occur in the second
quarter, if final demand weakensas expected.
On balance, although the continued upward momentum of business
investment should partly offset the expected moderation of other
sectors, the overall rate of economic growth is likely to be off in the
first quarter. GNP is projected to rise at the rate of about $14.5
billion and the real rate of growth to slacken to less than 3 per cent.
The rise in GNP in the second quarter is projected to ease
further to about $13 billion, and growth in real output could slow to
under 2.5 per cent. With growth of demand slackening, the pace of price
and wage increase should begin to slow and the GNP deflator, now estimated
to be running at close to a 4 per cent rate, may edge down to a 3.5 per
cent rate of increase by the second quarter.

Industrial production. On the basis of available data,
industrial production is estimated to have increased one index point
or more in November to around 166.0 per cent. At this level the index
would be somewhat above July, the previous high, and about 4 per cent
above a year earlier. Output gains are expected for both final products
and materials. Production of coal recovered following settlement of
strikes in October and added about .4 of one point to the total index
in November.
Auto assemblies in November were at a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of 9.2 million units. December schedules, after allowance
for plant closings over the holiday period are set at the same rate.
The monthly total of auto assemblies would decline from 873,000 in
November to 740,000 in December: thus, these holidays should help to
slow down the increase in dealers' stocks. Output of television
sets has been curtailed but production of some other consumer durable
goods and of some consumer nondurable goods probably rose further.
In the business equipment area, output of trucks and commer-
cial aircraft increased and preliminary data indicate a further rise
in production of nonelectrical machinery. The strengthening in the
production of business equipment very recently seems to be consistent
with the upsurge in new orders for durable goods, especially machinery,
and the latest Commerce-SEC Survey findings that plant and equipment
expenditures will rise appreciably in the fourth and first quarters.

II -8
Output of raw steel increased 13 per cent further in
November suggesting a stronger than anticipated demand for steel mill
products. With steel production below current consumption and with
inventories of steel mill shapes and forms at consuming mills down 20
per cent from the July peak to the end of October, output of steel
may increase further in December. Other November data indicate further
gains in production of textiles, paper, and chemical products.
Capacity Utilization. The November rate of manufacturing
capacity utilization is expected to be up slightly from the 83.3 per
cent recorded in October. This would be the second consecutive small
monthly increase, but in both months the production increase in man-
ufacturing industries other than iron and steel was apparently about in
line with the estimated increase in capacity, and the average rate
for all manufacturing would have remained constant if iron and steel
production had not increased sharply.
The industry pattern of operating rates remains much as it
has been for several months. The motor vehicle, rubber, petroleum,
and aircraft industries continue to operate at higher than normal rates.
Unused capacity remains for the production of most other manufacturing
products.

Retail sales. Retail sales in November rose 1.5 per cent
from October, according to advance estimates. This rise follows two
months of small declines, and the November increase brings the level
of sales slightly above the previous high reached in August.
Sales of nondurable goods stores rose 2.4 per cent; total
durable goods sales were virtually unchanged from October, with autos
down somewhat further but with other durables up 1.7 per cent after
declining between August and October. Sales of furniture and appliances
were particularly strong, rising more than 4 per cent. Every major
component of nondurable goods was up, but the greatest strength was in
the general merchandise category which rose nearly 5 per cent.I

Unit sales and stocks of autos. Sales of new domestic
autos, which had declined sharply in the first 10 days of November,
recovered in the two following selling periods and for the month as a
whole were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 8.9 million units,
compared with 9.1 million for the month of October. Stocks of new
domestic autos increased moderately further in November and were at a
new high; stocks also rose relative to sales and represented 53 days'
supply at current selling rates.II I Im Ill

II -11
Consumer instalment credit. Consumer instalment debt rose
sharply in October. Credit extensions increased somewhat more than
seasonally while repayments increased less than seasonally. On net,
the excess of borrowing over repayments in October provided consumers
with additional funds at an $11 billion annual rate (seasonally adjusted).
Personal and automobile loans outstanding increased most rapidly. Early
indications suggest that in November the growth in debt slowed some-
what from the record October rate.
For 1968 as a whole, we estimate that use of instalment
credit to supplement other funds will provide consumers with about an
extra $8 billion. In 1967, growth in outstandings was only a little over
$3 billion. While the 1968 increase is expected to rank with the record
year 1965 in dollar terms, the percentage increase during the current
year will be smaller. In recent years, increases have been as follows:

Manufacturers' orders and inventories. New orders for
durable goods rose 7 per cent in October, according to preliminary data.
The increase was concentrated in the business and defense equipment

II -12
areas, especially in transportation equipment other than motor vehicles.
Steel orders continued to rise sharply and were close to the levels
prevailing in mid-1967, before the steel inventory build-up commenced.
In contrast, orders for motor vehicles and parts declined in October,
an orders for consumer durables other than autos were about unchanged
from levels that have prevailed for over a year. Nondurable shipments
and orders increased at a moderate 1/2 per cent rate and the new orders
increase for total manufacturing was 4 per cent.
Unfilled orders for durable goods were up $1.3 billion (1.6
per cent) but the unfilled orders-shipments ratio declined to the lowest
point since December 1965. In addition to the effect of the steel
adjustment, this reflects a decline in the business and defense
equipment industries, where a $900 million rise in the backlog of
orders fell short of the sharp spurt in shipments and the unfilled
orders-shipments ratio declined. The latter ratio, which has been
declining irregularly since early 1967 and is now at its lowest point
since early 1964, is associated roughly with changes in the rate of
inventory accumulation in these industries. Its further decline
appears to suggest that there is little need for higher rates of in-
ventory build-up in the equipment sectors. With the sharp rise in
recent months, new and unfilled orders for the machinery and equipment
industries are high in relation to past levels, but, in defense industries,
new orders and the backlog are no higher than they were in March and
April of this year, in spite of the sharp October rise in new orders.

The total book value of manufacturers' inventories rose about
$500 million in October--an annual rate of over $6 billion. The in-
crease was somewhat greater in nondurables than in durables--$3.3 billion
and $2.7 billion annual rate, respectively.
In the durable sector, the equipment industries cut their
inventories slightly. The principal increases were in finished goods
inventories in "all other" durable industries, which include fabri-
cated metal products, lumber, furniture, instruments, ordnance, and
miscellaneous.
Steel users' inventories decreased 1.3 million tons in October,
about as much as in September; although steel users' receipts of the
metal increased, they used up even more. Continued decreases of this-26r l

II -14
order would bring December inventories to the year-ago level. These
decreases in unit stocks of steel have apparently been offset in part
by price increases in the book value data.
In nondurable goods industries, the principal inventory
increases in October were also in finished goods, and in the chemical,
food,and "all other" industries.
Construction and real estate. Value of new construction put
in place, which was revised upward by 2 per cent from the record high
reported earlier for October, changed little in November, based on
confidential preliminary extrapolations now available from the Census
Bureau. The upward revision for October was largely concentrated in
private nonresidential outlays (especially outlays for industrial
plants). As a result, outlays for this major group as a whole also
reached a new peak this autumn, along with those for private residen-
tial and public construction.
An important factor in the over-all uptrend has continued to
be the advance in construction costs. As estimated by the Census
Bureau, in November, as in the first ten months of the year, about half
the year-to-year increase of 11 per cent reflected higher costs.

1/ Seasonally adjusted annual rates: preliminary. Data for the most
recent month (November) are confidential Census Bureau extra-
polations. In no case should public reference be made to them.
Expectations by the Commerce Department for total new construc-
tion activity in 1969 are for a further over-all advance of 7 per cent
from the record 1968 volume currently estimated at $84.7 billion. Most
of this increase, if realized, would reflect further cost increases
rather than greater physical activity.
Housing starts, which in October--the latest month available--
held at the advanced 1.55 million seasonally adjusted annual rate
averaged in the third quarter, have thus far continued to benefit
from lender expectations of improved inflows aroused by passage of
the surtax package last June and by the round of upward adjustments in
State usury ceilings completed last summer. Given the record level
of commitments outstanding this autumn, and the strength of prevailing
demands for shelter staff expectations are for at least substantial
continuance of the current somewhat more than 1-1/2 million annual rate

II -16
of starts through the remainder of the year and into 1969. However,
a temporary drop in the rate to be reported for November is likely
because the number of working days in that month this year was un-
usually low. (The Census Bureau makes no specific adjustment for this
factor in its seasonally adjusted series.)
While savings flows to major mortgage lenders have not yet
begun to validate earlier optimistic expectations, trade projections
of private housing starts for 1969 continue to gravitate to a level
of 1.65 million units. These projections are based to an appreciable
extent on an assumption of easier mortgage market conditions during
most of 1969 as well as on the low level of vacancies and other evidences
of pent-up demand pressures. A 1.65 million starts total for 1969 would
compare with at least a 1.50 million unit total now indicated for 1968--
the highest since 1964--and with 1.29 million units in 1967 when
starts had already begun to recover from their 1966 low.
Plant and equipment spending. Nonfarm business plans to
increase its spending for new plant and equipment by nearly $4.0
billion, annual rate, in each of the current and following quarters
and then to reduce spending by more than $1 billion in the second
quarter of next year according to the Commerce-SEC survey of business
plans taken in late October and November. In relative terms, the
increases come to 6.0 per cent and 5.8 per cent, respectively, and the
decline to almost 2 per cent. (See table.)

II -17
Strength in spending plans in the current and next quarter
is fairly widespread among both manufacturing and nonmanufacturing in-
dustries. The fall-off now indicated in the second quarter of next
year reflects mainly a reduction in outlays by airlines as expansion
programs with existing types of aircraft are largely completed.
Little further rise in the second quarter of next year is now planned
by manufacturers.
Actual outlays in the third quarter were up only $800 million,
annual rate, or 1.3 per cent. This small rise contrasts with the $2.15
billion rise indicated for that quarter by the August survey. The
short-fall in third quarter expenditures from August plans was
mostly in spending by the nonrail transportation industry and the
communication, commercial, and other industries group.
For 1968, business plant and equipment spending is now
expected to total $64.5 billion, 4.7 per cent more than last year.
This increase compares with gains of 4.4 planned last August and of 6.7
per cent and 5.8 per cent last May and February, respectively. In
1967, fixed capital outlays had risen by 1.7 per cent. In each of the
three preceding years rates of increase had been around 15 per cent.

Earlier plans for outlays in the fourth quarter have been
revised up substantially, according to the November survey--from an
increase of $250 million (annual rate) to $3.8 billion. This very
large increase includes outlays on projects already underway as well as
expenditures planned on new projects begun this quarter. Manufacturers
started a record volume of new projects in the third quarter of 1968, and
the value of these projects totaled more than expenditures in the quarter.
In fact, manufacturers' carryover of expenditures yet to be incurred

the record level reached at the end of 1966. Carryover of public
utility projects underway rose to a new record, reflecting a larger
decline in expenditures in the third quarter than in the value of new
projects started.
The recent National Industrial Conference Board's survey of
the nation's thousand largest manufacturers suggests continued
strength in manufacturers' plant and equipment investment. According
to this survey, manufacturers' new capital appropriations rose by 9,5
per cent in the third quarter, the largest rise since the beginning
of 1965, and the backlog of unspent appropriations rose to a new
record high. Closing backlogs were 3.8 times larger than capital
expenditures in the quarter. This survey also indicated (confidential)
that manufacturers expect new appropriations to rise substantially
further in the fourth quarter.
Labor market. Reflecting strong demands in most sectors of
the economy, the labor market continued extremely taut in November.
Employment in nonfarm establishments rose briskly. Typical seasonal
increases in unemployment did not materialize this November and the
over-all unemployment rate dropped to 3.3 per cent, seasonally
adjusted, its lowest point in 15 years. Upward pressures on wages
kept hourly earnings rising at about the same rapid rate as in other
recent months.

II -20
The increase in payroll employment totaled 163,000 in
November, and the previously reported October increase was revised up
substantially (such adjustments are generally a sign of strength).
Despite the recent reductions in Federal employment--which was down
95,000 from its June 1968 peak--total employment has risen sharply
in the last two months after slower increases in the summer.

The sharp recent pickup in employment has been concentrated in
the nonindustrial sector, with the largest gains occurring in trade,
services and State and local government. Manufacturing employment
turned up in October and November after several months of stability
during the summer. Demand appeared to be up in the durable goods
industries, where, reflecting strengthening equipment expenditures,
machinery employment moved higher in both October and November. In
addition, most other durable goods industries showed small gains,
while employment in nondurable goods industries continued slightly
below the June 1968 peak level,

II -21
Weekly hours declined by two-tenths of an hour in manufacturing
in November. However, the reference week included a holiday (for which
seasonal adjustment is difficult) and unusually bad weather in some
parts of the country, both of which may have depressed hours. In durable
goods manufacturing, the workweek was unchanged over the month, but
compared to a year earlier was up four-tenths of an hour, with the
largest gains in the auto and fabricated metals industries. Although the
factory workweek has remained below the record highs of 1966, its recent
levels are among the highest in the postwar period.
Unemployment and labor force. Unemployment, which normally
rises by about 300,000 in November, as seasonal activities such as
construction and agriculture begin winter slowdowns, rose by only
65,000 this year. Thus, on a seasonally adjusted basis, unemployment
fell sharply and the overall unemployment rate dropped to a 15-year
low of 3.3 per cent. Unemployment dropped in all major labor force
groups, but adult men (20 and over), who are heavily represented in
the industry groups where seasonal employment reductions are common
in November, were most affected. Their jobless rate dropped to 2.0
per cent, equaling the low of March 1953, but otherwise its lowest
point since the end of World War II. Despite the very thin supply
of men and continuing strong labor demand, joblessness continues
very high among teenagers--a rate of 12.2 per cent in November.

For teenagers, both white and nonwhite, the unemployment
problem is partially a function of their numbers and the demand for
their skills. In 1952, they comprised only 6-1/2 per cent of the labor
force, and, job requirements being less stringent, their unemployment
rate was 8-1/2 per cent. In 1968, they account for 8 per cent of the
labor force in an economy which demands higher skills, and their
jobless rate is over 12 per cent. If the overall labor force dis-
tribution were the same in 1968 as it was in 1952, the current overall
unemployment rate would be 3.1 per cent, only slightly higher than
the 1952 rate.1966

The civilian labor force increased by 200,000 in November
after showing no change from August to October. Despite the November
pickup the labor force expansion continues below expectations and
appears to be contributing to the maintenance of low unemployment.
The increase from a year earlier amounted to 1.1 million in November,
considerably fewer than expected on the basis of long-term demographic
projections.

II -24
Compensation and productivity. Unit labor costs, compensa-
tion, and output per manhour in the private economy rose at about the
same rate in the third quarter as earlier in the year.

The increase in output per manhour so far this year approaches
the average rate of growth of productivity since World War II and is
about twice the 1967 gain. At the same time, increases in average
hourly compensation have been significantly higher than last year and,
despite the pickup in productivity, unit labor costs have averaged about
4 per cent higher than a year earlier. Although the rate of increase
of unit labor costs was no longer rising in 1968, it is significant that
it had not fallen appreciably; the 1968 rise in labor costs is likely to
be only slightly below that in 1969 and one of the largest since the
Korean War.

II -25
Industrial relations. The substantial gains in wages and
fringe benefits achieved this year were accompanied by a high level of
strike activity. Measured in terms of man-days of work lost, strike
activity during the first 10 months this year exceeded the comparable
figure for 1967. Recently, however, strike activity has diminished and
total man-days idle in 1968 may reach, but probably not surpass, last
year's total which was the highest since 1959.
It is likely that more than 50,000 longshoremen will strike
when the 80-day Taft-Hartley injunction period ends December 20. None
of the major issues in the negotiations have been resolved according to
the Board of Inquiry appointed by the President. The major disputed
issues are provisions to cushion or share the consequences and benefits
of containerization and union-wide bargaining. The union-wide bargaining
demand is focused on the guaranteed work-year provision. The New York
Shipping Association has agreed to a guaranteed 2,080 hours of work or
pay a year. At issue is the union demand for a similar provision in
contracts with shippers at other Atlantic and Gulf Coast ports. Sharp
differences between labor and management also exist with respect to
wage increases, liberalization of pensions, welfare benefits, vacations,
and the length of the contract.
With collective bargaining activity much reduced next year--
only about 2 million workers are covered by contract expirations or wage
reopenings compared with 4.6 million in 1968--strike activity can also
be expected to fall well below the high levels of 1967 and 1968. Con-
tract expirations center in transportation early in the year--railroads
and airlines--and in electrical products late in the year.

II -26
Wholesale prices. The BLS wholesale price index for industrial
commodities increased an estimated 0.1 per cent in November, as compared
with an average monthly rise of 0.35 per cent in September and October.
Slowing of the over-all rise last month stemmed in part from
a 22 per cent cut in prices of hot-rolled steel sheets. This cut for a
single, though major, steel product precipitated an estimated 1.5 per
cent decrease in the average price for all steel mill products--almost
reversing the 2.3 per cent rise, affecting a wide variety of steel
products, effective in late August and first appearing in the September
index. It now appears that most of the early-November price cut for
hot-rolled steel sheet will soon be restored, and at the same time prices
of some other steel products not included in the August boost are being
raised.
Excluding steel mill products, industrial prices increased
about 0.2 per cent in November. Lumber prices continued sharply
upward--at a time when a large seasonal decline usually occurs. Average
prices of lumber and plywood have increased in almost every month since
early 1967 for a total rise of 30 per cent--to a level nearly one-fifth
above the previous post-World War II high of May 1966--under the dual
impact of the strong resurgence in residential construction activity and
log and lumber supply limitations.
Machinery prices also rose further in November, bringing the
rise over the past year to about 3.5 per cent (as compared with 2.5 per
cent for all industrials combined). Recent pronounced strengthening in
business demands point to continuing price advances for producers'

II -27
equipment. Nonferrous metals' prices, which had declined substantially
from last March to September, have subsequently increased somewhat as
reported scarcities of copper scrap and higher prices for foreign copper
(because of a series of economic and political crises affecting foreign
producing and consuming countries) have led to price increases for
copper and brass mill products.
Altogether, the number of industrial product classes showing
increases in November declined from October. (In October, the diffusion
of increases had been the highest since last February's peak.) But the
November proportion was apparently somewhat higher than in September and
in November a year ago.
Prices of farm products and processed foods and feeds are
estimated by BLS to have increased contraseasonally in November, although
they remained below September and the seasonal high reached in July.
Prices of meats and poultry rose, although a decline is usual; fresh
fruits and vegetables showed larger than seasonal increases. The over-
all WPI rose an estimated 0.4 per cent in November, to 109.5 per cent
of the 1957-59 average--a new high.
Consumer prices. The consumer price index rose 0.6 per cent
in October, the largest monthly increase in six years. Larger-than-
seasonal increases for new autos and apparel and a contra-seasonal rise
in food prices accounted for half the rise, with the continuing rise in
service prices accounting for most of the remainder. At 122.9 per cent
of the 1957-59 average, the CPI had advanced 4 per cent in the first

II -28
10 months of the year and was 4.6 per cent above October 1967--the
largest gains for comparable periods since the early 1950's.
Allowance for the usual seasonal changes in auto and apparel
prices acts to moderate the over-all rise in consumer prices: new car
prices rose 1 per cent on a seasonally adjusted basis, as compared with
4.5 per cent unadjusted, and apparel rose 0.6 per cent adjusted and
1 per cent unadjusted. However, food prices rose more on a seasonally
adjusted basis; and prices of furniture, appliances, and other durables,
as well as of services in general, continued to rise at a sizable pace.
Altogether, after allowing for seasonal changes, and after excluding
mortgage interest charges (which in October showed little change), the
October rise in average consumer prices was only moderately less than
the change indicated by the unadjusted CPI, and it was considerably
larger than in September and the third quarter as a whole.
Part of the accelerated rise in consumer prices in October
appears to be special to that month and not representative of continuing
trends. A rise in seasonally adjusted food prices of almost 1 per cent--
stemming from an unusual combination of larger-than-usual increases for
eggs and dairy products, especially sharp increases for several fresh
vegetables, and a failure of meat prices to show their usual large
seasonal decline--will hardly persist in view of the general supply
outlook. Moreover, the amount by which the new car price rise exceeded
seasonal expectations in October approximated the price increase accorded
to new models after allowance for quality changes. Although the intro-
duction of new models at higher list prices in October has in recent

II -29
years become a quasi-seasonal phenomenon, the present seasonal factors
allow primarily for the elimination of dealer discounts from list prices
between September and October. The BLS assumes a further sizable
seasonal rise in new car prices in November as sales of old models are
largely phased out and the new, higher-priced (and undiscounted) models
account for the bulk of total sales. With consumer purchases of new
cars tending to edge off from earlier record levels, discounting of new
model prices may now be beginning, and seasonally adjusted new car
prices are unlikely to rise further from October.
Even after allowance for special influences in October and
assuming a smaller over-all rate of increase in November and December,
the rise in consumer prices (seasonally adjusted) for the fourth quarter
as a whole is likely to exceed that in the third quarter.
Expenditures for farm price stabilization. It has been
evident since midsummer that 1968 crops would be 3 to 4 per cent larger
than the record crop of 1967 despite cut-backs in acreages of wheat and
feed grains. It has also been evident that this increased production
would add as much as one billion dollars to the $2.9 billion projected
in the January Budget Document as the Commodity Credit Corporation costs
of supporting prices in fiscal 1969. Major expenditures for price
support usually occur in the first quarter of the fiscal year when about
two-thirds of farmers' direct payments are disbursed, and in the second
quarter when crops are going under price support loan in heavy volume.
In the third quarter of the fiscal year, down payments to farmers

II -30
signing acreage diversion contracts swell expenditures, and in the
fourth, expenditures drop sharply or net eceipts are recorded. Usually,
first quarter expenditures are the largest.
This fiscal year, first quarter expenditures amounted to $2.5
billion, up a little more than one billion dollars from a year earlier.
About half the increase was in larger payments to farmers for price
support and acreage diversion, and half was in greater outlays for loans
and inventories.
The larger payments are primarily the result of a shift in
policy from one encouraging expansion in 1967 grain acreage to rebuild
stocks depleted by the world food shortage to one cutting 1968 acreage
back to keep supplies in balance with needs.
The greater expenditures on loans and inventories in the
first quarter of fiscal 1969 contrasts with net liquidation that was
still in progress in the first quarter last year. The largest 1968 crop
moving under loan, so far, is wheat. Other crops will move under rapidly
through January if the seasonal pattern of past years is followed.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL SITUATION
Bank credit. Total loans and investments at all commercial
banks rose at approximately a 6 per cent annual rate in November, or
less than one-half the average pace of the previous three months. The
November slowdown reflects a large seasonally adjusted decline in bank
holdings of U.S. Government securities, resulting in part from the
delay until early December of the Treasury bill financing which normally
takes place in the latter half of November. However, expansion of bank
holdings of other securities, as well as bank loans, was rapid in
November, surpassing even the increased pace of recent months.

Aside from the influence of the delay in the recent Treasury
financing, bank holdings of U.S. Government securities--particularly
Treasury bills and short-term notes and bonds--declined considerably
druing November, following relatively little change over the previous
two months. A number of factors, including the high cost of CD funds,
the relatively attractive yields on municipals, and the continued
strength in loan demand probably contributed to the November decline
in bank holdings of Governments.
Banks did take other securities into portfolio at an
accelerated pace in November. As in October, the November increase
was virtually all in longer-term municipals, and appears to have been
financed, in part, by the continued liquidation of sizable amounts of
short-term issues. This apparent maturity-switching probably was
largely in response to the rise in long-term relative to short-term
municipal yields that has taken place over the past few months.
Reflecting a normal delivery lag of about 4 weeks, many of these
longer-term issues taken into portfolio in November may represent
purchases made during October.
Expansion of bank loans in November also exceeded the rapid
rate of recent months. However, the November increase was buoyed up
by a further acceleration in business loans, while growth in other loan
categories generally slackened. The $1.6 billion rise in business loans
is the largest monthly increase since June of 1966. November growth was
more steady throughout the month and more widespread among banks than in
October, but most of the rise appeared to be concentrated in retail

III -3
trade, construction, services, and public utilities. Reflecting this
recent strength in business loan demand and the increased cost of CD
funds, most banks raised their prime rate to 6.50 per cent in early
December. (The easing of interest rate policies indicated in the
November Bank Lending Practices Survey--in Appendix A--as compared to
the August survey was largely in response to the late September reduc-
tion in the prime rate, as the responses to the November survey were
made prior to the recent increase in the prime rate.)
Growth in consumer loans during November maintained the
increased pace that has prevailed since midyear. Demand for consumer
loans probably remained heavy in response to the continued large volume
of automobile sales. On the supply side, banks in the November Lending
Practices Survey generally indicated a greater willingness to make
consumer loans than was the case in the previous survey. Expansion in
real estate loans--as in October--also was large in November. Security
loans declined further as dealers continued to reduce their inventories,
on average, in November.
Bank deposits. Time and savings deposits at all commercial
banks, on a daily average basis, are estimated to have risen at approx-
imately a 15 per cent annual rate in November, only marginally below
the average rate of growth over the previous four months. As has been
the case since midyear, most of the November increase was attributable
to bank sales of CD's, although inflows of consumer-type time and
savings deposits also continued to show strength.

In spite of further tightening in the market for CD funds,
large banks were able to add nearly $1 billion to outstandings in
November, most of which was acquired after midmonth. Strong loan
demands, the high cost of Euro-dollars, and the specter of large CD
maturities in December and January may all have contributed to the more
active bidding by banks for CD's in November. During the latter half
of the month, most large banks were reported to be paying maximum rates
on all maturities in an effort to obtain what CD funds they were still
able to attract, which appeared to be increasingly in the longer
maturity ranges. Expectations of rising interest rates and increasing
doubts as to future availability of CD funds probably also contributed
to the willingness of banks to obtain these longer-term funds at ceiling
rates.

III -5
As in October, November inflows of consumer-type time and
savings deposits at large banks were much greater than in comparable
periods of recent years, but were somewhat more widespread among Federal
Reserve districts than were inflows during October. Time certificates
and open accounts, following less than normal outflows during the early
part of November--related to the withdrawal of Christmas club funds--
expanded rapidly in the last week of the month. Savings deposits at
large banks also exhibited unusual strength throughout November. At
country banks, savings deposits declined more than normally, although
these outflows were more than offset by increases in other time deposits.
However, country bank savings deposit figures do not represent only
passbook savings deposits--as do those at weekly reporting banks--but
also include Christmas club funds, which probably accounted for much of
the November decline in savings deposits at country banks.
With the cost of Euro-dollars still relatively high, banks
made little further use of this source of funds in November and early
December. Through the week ending December 4, bank liabilities out-
standing to their foreign branches remained generally unchanged from
the $7.2 billion average level in September.
The money stock--which began to increase in October after
having shown little change over the previous two months--rose at approx-
imately an 11 per cent annual rate in November, measured on a daily
average basis. The November increase reflects, in part, a large rise in
demand deposits during the latter half of the month--as U.S. Government

III -6
deposits declined sharply--although expansion of currency outstanding
also was sizable. The increases in the money stock over the past two
months may have also partly reflected the recent accelerated growth in
bank loans.
Mortgage markets and nonbank depositary intermediaries. The
sensitive secondary mortgage market for FHA and VA home mortgages con-
tinued to tighten through the early part of December. Although lagging
the increase in other capital market rates, implicit yields on FNMA's
6-month forward mortgage purchase commitments advanced further in
recent weeks, as shown in the table. By the December 9 auction, average
secondary market mortgage yields for the 6-month commitments series
reached 7.51 per cent. This was 35 basis points above the recent low
at the end of September, though still 20 basis points below the early-
June high.

Recent developments in the money and capital markets have
intensified the usual uncertainties prevailing in the home mortgage
market as the end-of-year dividend reinvestment period approaches.
Early in December, a number of S&L's in California, which had cut their
prime mortgage lending charges somewhat in September, reinstated their
former higher rate schedules, reportedly in response to heavy loan
demands, reduced savings inflows, and the commercial bank prime-rate
hikes around the turn of the month. Prior to that time, supplies of
funds, while somewhat less abundant than earlier, had been reported as
adequate in nearly all major areas to meet unusually strong, but
seasonally slackening, home mortgage credit demands at high interest
rates, according to both FNMA and VA field reports made toward the end
of November.
No information is yet available on either net savings inflows
or mortgage commitments at thrift institutions in November. Net inflows
through early autumn had accelerated somewhat from their reduced July
rate, and forward commitments apparently had remained unusually large
both absolutely and in relation to inflows.
In the primary mortgage market, recent upward pressures on
yields and associated discounts have once again begun to pose barriers
to credit flows for transactions involving individually-owned properties.
In the case of conventional mortgages, usury ceilings of 7 per cent or
less, for example, still prevail in 11 states, which altogether accounted
for about a fifth of the total number of all home and multifamily build-
ing permits issued last year.

III -8
A feature of mortgage market developments so far this year
has been the relatively large direct contribution of commercial banks
in a period of near-record aggregate net lending volume. In October,
commercial bank net takings accounted for as much as three-tenths of
the advanced volume of all institutional net lending on residential
and nonresidential mortgages, according to the estimates shown in the
table which are based on weekly reporting bank data. The commercial
bank share, undoubtedly reflecting in part heavy bank construction-loan
activity, far exceeded the shares of either savings banks or life
insurance companies. Each of the latter types of institutions, of
course, has continued to find bonds an unusually attractive investment.

Corporate and municipal bond markets. The continued flow of
bullish economic statistics and developing expectations of a tighter
monetary policy contributed to the renewal of the upward advance of
bond yields in mid-November. During the first week in December market
pressures were particularly intense following the bank prime rate

III -9
increase, and bond yields generally pierced their previous highs of
last May. (The level of yields indicated by the corporate Aaa new
issue series is understated for technical reasons.) Since August,
corporate and municipal yields have risen about 70 basis points. More
recently, the record yields on some corporate issues have elicited a
favorable investor response, and the rise in new issue yields appears
to have halted, at least temporarily.

In late November and early December, 9 corporate syndicates
were terminated, releasing over $100 million of unsold bonds; in free
market trading upward yield adjustments ranged to over 25 basis points.
Indicative of these developments was the adjustment on one of these

III -10
issues--an Aaa-rated bond with five-year call protection--that brought
its yield to 7 per cent in the free market. Municipal underwriters
also have reduced their inventories somewhat by substantial price-cutting
on older issues. Beyond these factors, the prospective sizable volume
of forthcoming bond offerings contributed to the pessimism of market
participants.
The unsettled market conditions in the last two weeks have
resulted, however, in a significantly reduced volume of near-term bond
offerings. In the corporate market, the December volume has been reduced
by $170 million due to the postponement of two issues and the cut-back
in size of another. Public offerings of corporate bonds in December are
now estimated at $525 million, substantially below the November volume
and the lowest for any month since October 1966. Total corporate
security offerings in December, including private placements and stocks,
will likely aggregate about $1.6 billion with a seasonal rise in private
placements offsetting the drop in public bond issues.

Corporate public bond offerings in January will probably
show a sizable increase from the reduced December volume. Nearly $700
million of issues are already scheduled and the total may build up
ultimately to about $950 million, above the average monthly volume of
issues in 1968. But a seasonal decline in private placements will
largely offset the rise in public bond offerings and, consequently,
corporate security offerings in total are likely to be around the
average monthly volume during 1968. It should be noted, however, that
the pace of new offerings may be significantly influenced by the course
of interest rates.
In the municipal market, as in the corporate market, the
outlook for forthcoming bond offerings has been altered by the unsettled
market conditions. Dealer inventories--which have been unusually high
since August--were reduced only a little by sharp price cutting in late
November and early December. In association with shifting market
sentiment, the inventory overhang has apparently resulted in cautious
bidding for new issues, as well as a withdrawal of some dealers from
underwriting syndicates. In this environment, over $150 million of
scheduled municipal bonds have been postponed since mid-November--some
due to forced bid rejections in states with below-market rate ceilings.
As a result, the estimated volume of municipal issues in November has
been reduced to $1.1 billion. The December estimated volume has been
lowered to $1.0 billion and allows for about $300 million of industrial
revenue bond offerings. However, the actual volume of industrial
revenue bonds may fall short of the currently expected volume due to

III -12
adverse market conditions and the constraint of statutory interest
rate ceilings in some states. Municipal bond offerings in January are
estimated at $1.1 billion, well below the monthly average during 1968,
but little changed from November and December despite the removal of
tax-exemption from industrial revenue issues in excess of $5 million
after year-end--which will eliminate these issues as a major market
factor,

Stock market. Stock prices continued to rise in November
and early December on an enlarged volume of trading. Since early
August, the major common stock price indices have risen approximately
12 per cent. Observers agree that the preponderance of favorable
economic news has provided the main support for this advance; the recent
pronounced weakening in the bond market has thus far had virtually no
effect on stock prices. At its new high on December 6, the broadly-based

III -13
New York Stock Exchange index showed prices 20 per cent above the 1966
high. On the American Exchange, where the median price/earnings ratio
of these less-seasoned issues reached a record 25 at the end of November,
prices paralleled the New York Exchange Index after July 1968, but were
up over 90 per cent from the 1966 peak.
Continued heavy trading volume recently led the major
Exchanges to continue 4-day trading weeks through the end of this year
and, starting January 6, to shorten the normal trading day by 90 minutes.
The curtailment, they announced, is to continue until "limitations are
no longer needed."
Data available through the end of October indicate that
stock market credit has not been a major factor in the recent upward
pressure on stock prices; margin debt actually has been declining since
the increase in margin requirements in late June. The major market
participants have apparently been institutions and foreigners, the
latter--according to some--providing an especially strong demand for
U. S. stocks during and immediately following the recent international
monetary crisis.

Government securities market. After edging higher immediately
following the last meeting of the Committee, yields on Government secur-
ities rose sharply further after the December 2 increase in the prime
rate. In some sectors increases amounted to more than 1/4 of a percentage
point, raising over-all advances since the last meeting to as much as
3/8 of a percentage point on notes and bonds and to over 1/2 a percentage
point on some Treasury bills. The 3-month Treasury bill was most recently
bid at 5.84 per cent.

Apart from the backwash of the crisis in foreign exchange
markets, the major factor putting upward pressure on yields prior to
the prime rate increase was a continued flow of bullish business news.
This was generally interpreted as indicating a stronger-than-forecast
economy in the months ahead and tended to dampen market psychology to
the point where a shift to tighter money appeared more likely, and hopes
for even a temporary decline of interest rates after the turn of the
year were significantly weakened. The prime rate action accentuated
this general shift in market sentiment and caused dealers to scramble
to reduce their inventory exposure.

III -16
During much of November, dealers had made net sales of
Treasury bills--in large measure to foreign buyers. This substantially
reduced their total bill positions, particularly in shorter maturities.
In late November, however, some return flow of bills from foreigners,
along with bills acquired in successive Treasury auctions of monthly,
weekly, and June tax bills added more than $1 billion to dealers net
positions. The weight of these holdings on the market followed the
prime rate increase contributed significantly to the sharp run-up of
bill yields. At the same time stepped-up selling of June tax bills by
banks added to market pressures. Dealers made considerable progress in
reducing bill positions taken on in late November, but they absorbed a
sizable part of the bank selling of tax bills.
In addition to the negative impact of shifting market
psychology on customer demand, the general updrift of yields on Treasury
notes and bonds that preceded the prime rate action was attributable
partly to swaps out of Treasury issues into new corporate bonds. Follow-
ing the prime rate action, dealers pressed aggressively to reduce
positions. But at the advanced yield levels which then developed, some
customer demand reappeared. While this interest has most recently
tapered off again as market sentiment has weakened, over the whole period
since late November dealers made significant progress in reducing holdings
of coupon issues, particularly in the over-5-year category.

Other short-term rates. With investment yields on 3-month,

6.18 per cent, respectively, new CD's at banks are being subjected to
intensified competition from market securities. As a result, CD
offering rates are now generally at the regulatory ceilings, and CD
yields in the secondary market have risen to a premium of about 10 basis
points above ceiling rates on 3-month maturities.
Yields on Federal Agency securities and bankers' acceptances
have also risen substantially since the last FOMC meeting, in line with
the general rise in interest rates; but as is customary yields on
commercial paper and finance company paper have lagged behind.

Federal finance. Strengthening of staff projections of
general economic activity over the rest of the fiscal year include
higher estimates for personal and corporate incomes. On the basis of
these revisions the staff has raised its fiscal year estimate of Federal
tax receipts by $1.5 billion. The bulk of this change occurs next
spring during the seasonal period of maximum personal and corporate
income tax payments. With the staff estimate of fiscal year budget
outlays still projected to run nearly $2 billion higher than the amount
indicated in the latest Budget Bureau estimate, the upward revision of
receipts reduces the prospective unified budget deficit to $3 billion.
On a national income accounts basis the new staff projection shows the
Federal sector approaching balance in the fourth quarter and then moving
to a surplus of $8.0 billion by the second quarter of 1969.
During November the Treasury cash balance declined by almost
$4 billion to a level of $2.8 billion. This decline would have been
even sharper had it not been for $0.6 billion sales of foreign series
securities to the Bundesbank.
In December, Treasury expenditures will continue to exceed
receipts through mid-month. In fact, the excess of expenditures over
receipts in just the first few days of the month was large enough to
use up all of the $1.9 billion of new money received December 2 from
the further sale of June tax bills. Yesterday, the Treasury had to
make a small special borrowing at the Federal Reserve in order to
maintain a manageable operating balance. Further overdrafts of some-
what larger magnitude, are expected on several days between now and next

III -20
Tuesday. But after mid-December receipts of $5.5 billion expected
from corporate income taxes will rebuild the Treasury's cash position.
In the first half of January the balance will again experience
seasonal drains and slide to a temporary low at mid-month. Our projec-
tions suggest that this drain will again force the Treasury to borrow
temporarily from the Federal Reserve, unless some additional cash is
raised from the public. Treasury new money borrowing will be needed
later in the first quarter, in any event, before the balance is
replenished by the massive inflow of April tax receipts. Total cash
requirments for the first quarter may amount to perhaps $1.5 to $2.5
billion.

Foreign exchange market developments. During the week following
the recent exchange crisis -- November 24-30 -- there was some unwinding
of speculative positions that had been built up in anticipation of a mark
revaluation with its possible repercussions on other exchange parities.
Funds flowed out of marks and to a much lesser extent back into sterling
and French francs. However, in the first week of December the outflow
from Bundesbank reserves dwindled sharply from the volume of the previous
week, a general air of uncertainty reappeared, and growing pessimism
over sterling caused the Bank of England to suffer large reserve losses
in holding the exchange rate for the pound at about $2.3830.
The price of gold -- after easing slightly from the $40 an
ounce level reached during the crisis -- has moved back above $40 and
on December 11 was fixed in London at $40.95, its highest level in that
market since early July.
During the final week of November the Bundesbank sold about
$900 million spot in the exchange market. In the first week of
December its spot sales were only $150 million, and so far in the
second week of December they have totaled $115 million. In the

IV -2
week immediately following the crisis the Bundesbank intervened to
hold the premium on the forward mark down to 3 per cent per annum, in
order to have a favorable psychological impact on the market and to
encourage the outflow of funds from marks; it sold a total of about
$240 million of marks forward on an outright basis. The Federal
Reserve sold an additional $70 million of marks forward in the New
York market.
Beginning December 2 the Bundesbank stopped its intervention
in the forward market on an outright basis and reinstituted its policy
of doing swaps -- selling dollars spot (but only for short-term in-
vestments in dollar assets) and buying them back forward at a 2.75
per cent per annum discount (premium on the forward mark). In the
first seven trading days of December it did about $425 million of
such swaps. However, the Bundesbank has a very large volume of swaps
contracted in earlier months which come due in December, and the Bank
may have to continue to offer swaps at very attractive rates to the
market if it is to avoid adding to its reserves from these maturing
swaps.
The Bank of England was able to make very modest purchases
of foreign currencies in the week following the crisis. However,
during early December a growing undertone of pessimism developed in
the market for sterling and very heavy selling pressure developed on
the pound. (This morning short covering produced a spurt of heavy
buying of spot sterling. Thereafter the market was erratic.)

IV -3
It is difficult to point to any single factor responsible for
the renewed pressure against sterling. Reportedly the unrest in the
Middle East was an important triggering factor; Middle Eastern residents
were large sellers of sterling. In addition, the announcement of a
large reserve loss during November -- though ascribed in part to large
debt repayments -- apparently contributed to the pessimistic market
atmosphere as did growing apprehensiveness over the November trade
figures which will be announced December 12. Finally, there has been
considerable discussion in the British press of the unsatisfactory
results of the devaluation a year ago and the likelihood that the
Bank of England debt repayments scheduled for 1969 will have to be
rephased. The sharp deterioration in market confidence in sterling
is reflected in the very large discount that has once again developed
for forward sterling in spite of occasional Bank of England support.
On December 11 the discount on three-month contracts was slightly
over 7 per cent per annum in London, compared with 2.95 per cent at
the first of the month.
French exchange controls apparently have the franc market
well under control for now and market quotations for the franc gener-
ally reflect the Bank of France's operating rates. More restrictive
exchange controls were put into effect December 5 -- both on spot
and forward market transactions -- and these are expected to generate
a significant volume of foreign currency sales by French banks and

IV -4
others to the Bank of France before the end of the year. The Bank of
France has purchased a moderate amount of dollars during the 12 trading
days since the crisis. However, the suspicion in which the franc is
still held is indicated by the very large discount on forward francs
in markets outside France; the discount on three-month forward contracts
is now nearly 8-1/2 per cent per annum.
U.S. balance of payments. In the final quarter of 1968 the
normal uncertainties that surround an evaluation of the outlook for
the balance of payments are augmented by the crisis in international
exchange markets and also by an imminent strike of longshoremen at East
Coast and Gulf ports. Moreover, the restrictions on private direct in-
vestment may result in unusual year-end inflows of capital as companies
satisfy the regulations by repatriating part of the remaining proceeds
of their foreign borrowings.
The October liquidity deficit was $584 million (not seasonally
adjusted), which was sizable though not extraordinary for this seasonally
adverse month. During the month there was a substantial net increase in
bank-reported claims on foreigners of $180 million, which was perhaps
more than would be expected on the basis of the usual seasonal pattern.
There were sizable flows to Europe, Canada, and Latin America.
Net U.S. purchases of foreign bonds in October were fairly
large at $240 million, the principal item being a new issue of the
World Bank of $179 million. U.S. investors sold about $60 million

IV -5
(net) of foreign equity securities in the month, much of which repre-
sented liquidation of a large minority interest in a U.K. firm rather
than a shift from a pattern of moderate outflows. The net inflow of
foreign capital to purchase U.S. equity securities was $204 million
in October -- somewhat larger than the monthly average for the year
so far.
In November the weekly data showed mounting liquidity
deficits, with the deficit rising sharply in the week of heavy
speculative capital flow into Germany, and continuing high until
near the end of the month. At the end of November, or early in
December (it is not yet clear what the monthly reports will show)
a large surplus appeared, offsetting to some extent the formidable
deficit that had been accumulating. The surplus in early December
probably included the return of some speculative funds and perhaps
also some inflows from U.S. direct investors. It now appears that
the October and November liquidity deficits (not seasonally adjusted)
totaled roughly $1.2 billion. Seasonal factors in the final months
of the year are highly erratic. For October and November together
the allowance for adverse seasonality should perhaps be on the order
of $400 million, or even more, so that the seasonally adjusted liqui-
dity deficit for the two months would be perhaps $3/4 billion.
In October and November the amount of receipts under
financing arrangements between the Treasury and foreign governments

IV -6
was about $250 million, comprised mainly of $125 million from Germany
under the military offset agreement and $100 million from Japan as an
advance repayment on loans from the Export-Import Bank. In addition,
international agencies invested $194 million in long-term deposits
and U.S. Agency securities, absorbing most of the proceeds of new
bonds sold by them in the U.S. market in the period.
The remainder of the year seems likely to be dominated by
relatively transient transactions. The month of December is seasonally
favorable, and an allowance of about $1/4 billion will have to be made
for this. Export receipts were probably above normal in November and
early December because of pre-strike accelerations of shipments, but
this could mean a cut in receipts in the final weeks of the year.
However, large receipts in those weeks are likely to occur as financ-
ing arranged by the Treasury with foreign governments and the inter-
national agencies (other than the IMF) mounts up, and also because of
the operations of the direct investment controls.
According to the third-quarter accounts (which will not be
published until late in the month and should be held strictly confi-
dential) the expected reduction in direct investment outflows in that
quarter did not occur. The flow to the European continent was somewhat
reduced, but there was a very large flow to the U.K. (partly for requi-
sitions of interests in existing firms) and a continued large flow into
Canada and Latin America. In the quarter the companies sold over $500

IV -7
million of new issues in foreign markets, but they used only a little
over $200 million of such foreign funds to finance capital outflows
while adding about as much to their holdings of accumulated proceeds
abroad. By the end of September the accumulated funds held abroad
available for use by the companies were about $1.5 billion. Under
the terms of the Commerce program, some of these funds will have to
be repatriated by the end of the year to the extent that companies
holding them would exceed their allowables for the year without such
credits. The amount involved would be only a fraction of the accumu-
lated total, but could be several hundred million dollars. Other
funds might be returned simply to make sure of compliance with the
regulations, but then could return abroad next year.
An important part of the improvement in the third quarter
liquidity balance remains unexplained, and the residual item -- errors
and omissions -- shifted strikingly from a negative $429 million in
the second quarter to an equally large positive amount in the third.
One explanation may be that the second quarter unrecorded payments
represented in part a return flow to Canada as confidence in that
currency was restored, while the third quarter receipts included
inflows following the mid-year crisis of the French franc and before
the talk of German revaluation had begun. With such large elements
of uncertainty prevalent, the outcome for the liquidity deficit in
the fourth quarter remains quite unpredictable.

IV -8
On the official reserve transactions basis, as reported
three weeks ago, there was a surplus of $444 million in the third
quarter, seasonally adjusted. During October and November there
were sizable deficits on this basis, on the order of $900 million,
not seasonally adjusted. Spreads between Euro-dollar rates and U.S.
rates have widened, probably partly because of absorption of Euro-
dollar funds in speculation against the German mark. Also, U.S.
companies have ceased to become major suppliers to the market since
their dollar borrowings abroad have declined, and they may have be-
gun to draw down their balances.
U.S. foreign trade. The trade balance in October was again
in deficit following a relatively large surplus in the preceding month,
as exports fell sharply while the drop in imports was more moderate.
It is now estimated that 40 per cent of the third quarter improvement
in the trade surplus (compared to the first half) was due to shifting
of shipments into September that would have been made in October in
the absence of a longshoremen's strike threat.
With only dim prospects for a new labor agreement being
reached before expiration of the Taft-Hartley injunction on December 20,
the recent pattern of anticipatory trade movements may be repeated.
An actual strike call, which now seems almost certain, would deepen
the possible import balance in the early weeks of 1969, as the value
of waterborne general cargo, requiring the use of longshoremen, is
greater for exports than imports though East and Gulf Coast ports.

IV -9
The combined trade total for July-October -- which spans
the recent strike-affected months -- may be indicative of basic
trends in exports and imports. In this period the trade surplus
was at an annual rate of $1/2 billion (balance of payments basis.)
The rise in exports between the first six months and July-October
was at an annual rate of 12 per cent, only moderately below the
high 15 per cent rate of increase from the preceding half year.
Similarly calculated, the recent rate of increase in imports was
about 10 per cent, compared with 36 per cent earlier.
Effects of German. British and French measures on U.S.
trade. The recent measures taken by Germany to reduce its export
surplus, and France and the United Kingdom to improve their trade
position (described in the following section) are not expected to
affect significantly the value of U.S. trade directly with these
countries. Germany's border tax modifications, however, may im-
prove the United States export prospects in third markets.
In 1967 foodstuffs and industrial materials made up about
50 per cent of total U.S. exports to Germany and the United Kingdom
and 40 per cent of shipments to France. These products are either
exempt from the new measures, as in the U.K., or are assumed to
have a low price elasticity, with demand governed more by supply
conditions, internally and externally.

IV -10
Most of the remaining U.S. exports to these countries
last year were capital goods, machinery primarily, but also air-
craft. Machinery is a long-lead item and such exports may not be
immediately affected. Consumer goods were about 5 per cent of
total U.S. shipments to each country, and may be affected more
and sooner, as they are generally more price responsive. A very
rough estimate, assuming import price increases of about 2 per cent
in Britain and France and decreases of 4 per cent in Germany, is
that a year from now, other things being equal, U.S. exports to
Britain and France might be reduced about $100 million (annual
rate) and exports to Germany increased by about as much.
The impact on U.S. imports from these countries may also
be small. British export prices are not changed by the new regula-
tions. About one-third of U.S. imports from France are consumer
goods and another 15 per cent is machinery. Imports of these
commodities may increase somewhat but probably by less than $25
million. More than one-third of total U.S. imports from Germany
is automobiles and parts. It is questionable whether U.S. auto-
mobile buyers would be induced to switch to domestic cars for the
announced $50 price increase. It is possible that those buyers
who are particularly price sensitive would consider buying a
Japanese, Italian or some other foreign car in place of a Volkswagen
or Opel. Such shifts might also occur for cameras, radios and
other types of consumer goods as well as steel imported from Germany.

IV -11
The greatest benefit to U.S. trade from higher German
export prices may be to improve the United States's competitive
position in third markets, in some of which our share of sales of
major categories of manufactures has declined relative to Germany's
in recent years. While unit value indexes may only approximate
actual export price movements, it may be noted that the indexes
would suggest that U.S. export prices for manufactured goods have
increased much more sharply than those for Germany since 1964 --
12 per cent against 3 per cent.

IV -12
Recent policy measures: France, Germany, the United Kingdom. The
measures taken by France, Germany and the United Kingdom during the recent
foreign exchange crisis and since the Bonn G-10 Meeting will affect the
levels of economic activity and foreign trade next year in these three
countries and -- to a much smaller extent -- in other industrialized coun-
tries. The French measures, more far-reaching than the others, could
significantly damp down French economic expansion in 1969 and, if wages
can be held back, yield a substantial improvement in the country's trade
balance. The German measures, which are designed to reduce Germany's trade
surplus, will probably not slow the overall rise in German economic activ-
ity significantly. The British measures should help to restrain U.K.
consumption and imports and thereby to bring the balance of payments
improvement that has been expected ever since last year's devaluation.
France acts to reduce expansion. Internal economic developments
in France during October showed continuing recovery from the upheavel of
May and June. Production was expanding rapidly, a consumer boom was
clearly under way, order backlogs were rising and there was a slight
decline in the level of unemployment. Confidence in the stability of
the franc, badly shaken in the summer and especially when flows into marks
took place in early September, was very slow in returning and there was
only a slight slowing of French reserve losses in October. Uneasiness
about the franc may have been due in part to France's inability to keep
price rises from accelerating sharply and thereby exceeding the official
target of 5 per cent (December to December). Consumer prices rose at an
annual rate of 8 per cent in September and 12 per cent in October, bringing

IV -13
the year-to-year rise by October to 5.9 per cent. The acceleration of
price rises in September-October was explainable only in part by seasonal
influences and increases in prices of services provided by nationalized
industries.
Early in November a second wave of speculation on a DM revalua-
tion rapidly pushed French capital outflows to an unsustainable level.
The measures taken by the French Government before and after the Bonn
meeting included the following: re-imposition of exchange controls,
reinforced credit restraint, a reduction in the projected budget deficit
for 1969, and -- instread of the widely expected franc devaluation -- tax
reforms designed to stimulate exports and reduce imports.
Immediate impacts on flows of funds have been favorable.
Despite a further worsening in the underlying balance of payments in
November, the Bank of France has gained net reserves in the past fort-
night. (The November trade deficit was about $200 million, seasonally
adjusted, up considerably from the $160 million average of September-
October.)
The new French exchange controls, in effect since November 24,
are similar to those in force last summer in that all current trans-
actions will receive general authorization. However, the new controls
are much tighter with regard to exports of French bank notes, holdings
of foreign currency assets, repatriation of proceeds of export payments,
and importers' forward purchases of foreign exchange. The tourist
allowance is set at Fr 700 ($140) per trip exceeding 24 hours, compared
with Fr 1,000 ($200) allowed under the previous controls.

IV -14
Monetary measures adopted on November 12 included an increase
in the Bank of France's discount rate by 1 percentage point to 6 per
cent, an increase in commercial banks' reserve requirements, and a
severe quantitative limitation on short-term credit expansion. Out-
standing short-term credits granted by French banks as of December 31
are not to exceed 104 per cent of the level of September 30, and must
be reduced to 101 per cent of that level by January 31, 1969. Since the
announcement of these measures, the Bank of France has further limited
its assistance to the money market and raised the cost of that assistance,
thereby driving the day-to-day money rate to more than 10 per cent from
the 7 per cent level at the end of October. Early in December this rate
declined to 8-1/4 per cent. The new measures should sharply slow down,
if not halt, the rapid expansion of bank credit and money supply which
had been permitted after the May disturbances.
On November 26, Prime Minister Couve de Murville submitted to
the National Assembly a series of amendments to the 1969 French budget.
Planned increases in government expenditures will be cut and tax receipts
will be increased, resulting in a reduction in the estimated budget
deficit for calendar 1969 from Fr 11.6 billion ($2.3 billion) to Fr 6.35
billion ($1.23 billion). This is well below the deficit of Fr 14 billion
($2.8 billion) now estimated for calendar 1968. The revised budget,
approved last week by the Assembly, reduces Government expenditures by
Fr 2.8 billion including a cut of Fr 400 million in defense appropriations
and atomic test programs, and provides for an increase of Fr 2.5 billion
in estimated tax receipts in 1969, largely through the tax reforms dis-
cussed below.

IV -15
As a result of these French measures, it is likely that the
increase in real GNP from 1968 to 1969 will not be as great as the
7.6 per cent envisaged last summer -- which did not look unusually
large, being measured from a base depressed by the loss of output in
May-June. However, if further social unrest is escaped, the year-to-
year expansion may still be around 5 per cent. This implies very little
further gain beyond the level of activity already reached in the current
quarter, and probably also implies growing unemployment.
The tax reforms mentioned above are designed to increase govern-
ment tax receipts in 1969 and to help improve the French trade balance.
The wages tax of 4-1/4 per cent, levied on payrolls, is abolished for
most employees. The four rates of value-added tax were increased as
follows:
Low rate (mainly agricultural goods) from 6 to 7 per cent
Intermediate rate (energy, some raw mats.) from 13 to 15 per cent
Regular rate (most goods) from 16-2/3 to 19 per cent
High rate (luxuries, incl. cars) from 20 to 25 per cent
The increases in value-added tax rates, apart from increasing tax
receipts, will permit the French authorities to increase border tax adjust-
ments for most imports. Domestic prices of imported goods will tend to be
increased by an average of about 2.5 per cent. Taking into account the
composition of French imports from Germany and from other countries, we
estimate that prices of goods imported from Germany will rise by over
4 per cent, while prices of imports from other countries, including those
from the United States, might be increased by an average of about 2 per
cent. (These estimates involve assumptions regarding the degree of absorp-
tion of tax burdens by exporters and importers).

IV -16
The increases in value-added tax rates are expected to give an
upward push to prices of domestically produced goods as a whole, despite
the abolition of the wage tax -- over and above other influences on
prices. The Government is exerting strong pressure on manufacturers and
retailers to consider the offsetting effects of the removal of the wage
tax in setting prices and has granted some minor tax reliefs (for example,
the turnover tax on meat was abolished). Some special concessions for
value-added tax payments in December will postpone some price increases
until next year. The Government may resort to price controls if price
increases appear to be excessive. Nevertheless, prices are expected to
rise sharply this month partly because of increases in prices of many
services, which are not covered by existing price agreements and were not
subject to the wage tax. Also, a rise in charges for railroad freight,
electricity and gas for industry, and road transport, has already occurred
in December; this is related to the budget cut of Fr 1.2 billion in sub-
sidies to nationalized industries.
The French Government expects consumer prices to increase about
6 per cent during 1969 (December to December). However, even in the
absence of social unrest, the Government may have to agree to substantial
wage increases during the forthcoming March talks with labor and manage-
ment. The cost push on the price level may be so strong that strict price
controls may have to be instituted to prevent consumer prices from rising
next year more than 6 per cent.
The substitution of the rebatable value-added tax for the wage
tax should tend to reduce French export prices. Prices of French products
paid by foreign importers, according to our estimates, should be reduced,

IV -17
other things being equal, by about 2.7 per cent. With the reduction of
border taxes in Germany, the cost to German importers of French products
should be cut by about 5.6 per cent, and French export prices to all
other countries may be reduced by about 2.3 per cent.
According to French official estimates, the effects on imports
and exports of the tax changes, together with the effects of the damping
of domestic demand, should be a substantial improvement in the French
trade balance in 1969, probably at the cost of some deterioration in em-
ployment. For 1969 as a whole, according to these estimates, the current
account balance (trade and services) may be either in slight surplus or
deficit, compared to a 1969 deficit, as recently estimated, of about $1
billion. The validity of this projection depends on avoidance of large
wage increases next spring.
Germany changes border tax rates. The German trade surplus,
which in 1963-66 averaged $1.3 billion a year (imports valued c.i.f.),
has been running since mid-1967 at annual rates over $4 billion and in
recent months at nearly a $5 billion rate. In November, the rumors of
a DM revaluation led to exceptionally large speculative capital inflows.
In order to discourage the German commercial banks from seeking out or
accepting foreign deposits the Bundesbank raised reserve requirements
against increases in foreign deposits to 100 per cent, effective
November 20. Rather than revaluing the mark, the Government secured
Parliamentary approval for a reduction for a period of 16 months in the
value-added tax rates applied to imports and the rebates of value-added
tax on exports.

IV -18
Specifically, the value-added tax rates were reduced as
follows:
Low rate (mainly agricultural products) from 5.5 to 3.5 per cent
Standard rate (all other goods) from 11 to 7 per cent.
The immediate effect toward reducing prices of imported goods
in Germany may well be as much as the amount of the tax reductions --
as German officials assume. But the impact on prices of German exports
(a rise) will be delayed and will probably be less than the reduction in
the tax rebates. The German authorities granted numerous exceptions for
contracts already negotiated or in cases where hardship could be proved
by the German exporters on contracts negotiated without specific prices.
Moreover, it is unlikely that German exporters will fully shift forward
the cost to them of the reduction in the value-added tax rebate. German
officials expect exporters to shift forward about two-thirds of the change
(about 2.7 per cent) and absorb the balance in their profit margin. The
only announced price change on a major German export, that for Volkswagen
cars in the United States, is a hike of 2.9 per cent, implying a somewhat
larger increase in ex-factory prices. The German authorities estimate
that the tax changes will result in additional tax revenues of DM 1.3
billion ($325 million) in 1969. It is proposed to use this additional
revenue to help export industries to re-direct some of their resources
towards production for domestic sale.
According to official German estimates, the reduction in the
trade surplus ascribable directly to the tax changes should amount to
$1.25 billion. Our own estimate is smaller: in the range of $750 million
to $1 billion.

IV -19
The impact of the German tax changes on the rate of growth
of GNP in 1969 is not likely to be significant. Since demand will still
be pressing upon available resources, the previously estimated 4-1/2 per
cent real GNP expansion in 1969 may well be achieved. The upward
pressure on costs and prices, which has began to develop this year, may
be somewhat relieved by the reduction in import prices. Some moderate
narrowing of the trade surplus, beyond that due directly to the tax
changes, may result from the rise in income and from fuller utilization
of German capacity, but the trade surplus will remain very large -- still
necessitating large long-term capital outflows to compensate for the
current account surplus.
Britain imposes further austerity measures. On November 22,
the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced a series of measures designed
to reduce the level of British imports and consumer spending. The measures
had been prepared before the foreign exchange crisis, but it appears clear
that the crisis accelerated their implementation.
The devaluation of last November has been working for exports,
which are now (September-October) 14 per cent larger in volume than at
mid-1967, before the 1967 dock strike. But, because of reduced export
prices (in dollars) and -- above all -- because of continuing high imports,
the merchandise trade deficit is still running about $1 billion greater
than in 1966.
To reduce consumption and imports, the Government activated the
"regulator," by which a surcharge of 10 per cent was imposed on the duties

for beer, wines, spirits, petrol and tobacco and on all rates of purchase
tax. Further, an import deposit system was announced, requiring importers
of semi-manufactured and manufactured goods to establish a deposit equal
to 50 per cent of the import value of the goods. The Government will pay
no interest on these deposits and will retain them for a period of 180
days. About two-fifths of total British imports will be affected by this
requirement.
In the monetary field, the ceiling on sterling lending by the
London clearing banks and the Scottish banks was reduced from 104 per cent

IV -21
of the November 1967 level to 98 per cent of that level. The reduction
must be accomplished by March 1969. However, export credits and fixed-
rate credits for domestic shipbuilding were placed outside the ceiling.
The National Institute estimates that the improvement in the
British trade balance in 1969 ascribable to the import deposit plan plus
the new restraints on consumption may be in the range of £100 million
to £250 million. Expressed in terms of an import surcharge, at an
interest rate of 8 per cent the six-month 50 per cent import deposit
requirement represents an added domestic cost of 2 per cent on the imports
affected.
Some balance of payments benefit may be achieved through the
capital account. With bank credit difficult to obtain in the United
Kingdom, some importers may be able to obtain additional credit from
foreign suppliers. For example, the Irish Government has instructed
Irish banks to pay the deposits for the British importers and is under-
taking to pay interest on these loans.
The surcharge on purchase and excise taxes, which applies
equally to domestic and imported goods, will have an impact on the British
price level. In direct response to this measure prices should rise by
one per cent within three months, and may rise by as much as 1-1/2 per
cent in a year. The effectiveness of this price advance in restraining
real consumption will depend of course on Britain's success in restrain-
ing wage increases.
The new measures should have some damping effect on economic
activity in Britain. Assuming no greater wage increases than had been

IV -22
expected earlier, real consumer spending, according to the National
Institute's estimate, should fall by about 3/4 or 1 per cent. The rate
of real GNP expansion may be slightly reduced, perhaps by one-half of
a percentage point, making the 1968-to-1969 increase about 2-1/2 or 3
per cent. Unemployment, which previously had been expected to decline,
is now likely to remain at its present level -- 2.4 per cent, seasonally
adjusted, in October -- throughout 1969.
Measures should have small impact on trade of other countries.
For Italy and the smaller European countries -- as also for all other
countries including the United States -- the direct impacts on their
foreign trade of the actions taken in the past three weeks by France and
Britain will tend to be offset -- in some cases perhaps more than offset --
by the effects of the German border tax changes.
One factor influencing the net impact is the relative importance
within each country's trade of its trade with France, Germany and the
United Kingdom. The Netherlands, Belgium, and perhaps Switzerland, should
get larger net exports through the relatively high concentration of their
trade with Germany. The composition of each country's trade is also relevant.
Italy, for example, has important exports of cars to France and the large
French border tax adjustment on cars may affect these exports dispro-
portionately. Spain has sizable exports to both France and Britain, but
these consist mainly of agricultural products on which the French and
British measures will not bear heavily. However, the French exchange
controls may significantly affect Spanish tourist receipts next year.

For some countries, the effect of the recent measures may be
felt in export competition in third-country markets. In particular, as noted
earlier, the severity of German competition with U.S. exports may be some-
what lessened. Japanese exports, too, may be helped in third markets.

APPENDIX A: SURVEY OF BANK LENDING PRACTICES*
Thirty-six per cent of the 125 banks reporting in the
November 15 Bank Lending Practices Survey indicated that demand for
business loans was stronger--while only ten per cent reported weaker
business loan demand--during the current three-month reporting period
as compared with the preceding one (see Table 1). Nearly 30 per
cent of the respondent banks anticipate stronger loan demand in the
next three months. However, in contrast to recent past surveys, banks
with deposits under $1 billion experienced stronger loan demand than
larger banks and a greater proportion of the smaller banks anticipate
stronger loan demand during the next three months (see Table 2).
Interest Rates and Compensating Balance Requirements
About 35 per cent of the banks indicated that they had eased
their policies regarding interest rates charged on loans to nonfinancial
businesses, and approximately 30 per cent had eased such policies on
loans to independent finance companies. While many banks commented
that the decline in interest rates was in response to increased deposit
inflows, others indicated that their "easier" interest rate response
on this survey reflected the late September reduction in the prime
rate. The survey, of course, had preceded the recent prime rate increase.
Almost nine-tenths of the respondent banks reported essentially
unchanged policies regarding compensating balance requirements on
business loans. On loans to finance companies, nearly all banks re-
ported that these policies had not changed. However, interest rate and
compensating balance policies on loans to both nonfinancial businesses
and finance companies were somewhat firmer at smaller banks, where
recent loan demands have been relatively heavy.
Other Nonprice Terms and Conditions
Nonprice terms and conditions to business and finance
company borrowers generally were unchanged at most reporting banks.
However, a somewhat firmer policy was established in dealing with new
and nonlocal area business customers, and there was also some further
reluctance to establish new or larger credit lines for independent
finance companies, particularly at smaller banks.
Willingness to Make Other Types of Loans
While willingness to make term, mortgage, participation and
broker loans was essentially unchanged, almost one-fifth of the banks
had become more willing to make consumer instalment loans in the
current reporting period. Several banks indicated improved deposit
inflows, the high yield on consumer instalment loans, and bank credit
card plans as the major reasons for their interest in these loans.

Division of Research and Statistics.

Bank Lending Policies over 1968
Loan demand, which was reported much stronger in the May
Survey, remained relatively unchanged until the current survey, in
which banks again reported that demand had increased. Bank policies
with respect to loans to nonfinancial businesses and noncaptive
finance companies, which had firmed significantly in the May Survey
period, generally remained firm through the November survey, except
for the recent easing in interest rate policy. With the exception of
consumer instalment loans, bank willingness to make several major
types of loans was reduced substantially in the May Survey and has
shown little tendency to increase since that time.
