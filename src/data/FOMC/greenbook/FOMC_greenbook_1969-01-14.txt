SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK
Outlook for economic activity
The economy has entered the new year showing evidence of a
growing imbalance between output and consumption. Although growth of
GNP in the fourth quarter appears to have been about as large as in
the previous quarter, the rise was mainly sustained by substantial
inventory accumulation. Income growth slowed and the increase in
personal consumption expenditures moderated significantly--reflecting
particularly a drop in auto sales, but moderation in the rise in non-
durables as well. Although residential construction activity and
business expenditures for plant and equipment apparently rose briskly
in the fourth quarter, the increase in total final sales still dropped
sharply to an estimated annual rate of $15 billion from $21 billion in
the third quarter.
Growth in GNP is expected to slow markedly in the first and
second quarters. With stock-sales ratios apparently moving up at year-
end, and consumer expenditures expected to increase only moderately
because of a further tax bite, stock building should ease, resulting
in adjustments of production schedules. Output schedules for autos
have already been lowered for January. Even if final sales were to
advance at about the reduced fourth quarter rate, less intensive inven-
tory buildup could reduce real growth in GNP to less than 3 per cent in
the first quarter.

I -2
As slower growth in final demands continues to dampen
incentives for inventory building, businessmen are also likely to start
to trim their plans for capacity expansion, given the rather substantial
industrial capacity available. The impact of credit restraint should
also limit construction activity, particularly if there is widespread
disintermediation at thrift institutions. Moreover, Federal spending
for goods and services should be level to down by the spring quarter.
Consequently, real growth in total GNP could be down to less than a
2 per cent annual rate by midyear. With overall demand easing, some
reduction of price pressures may be anticipated, and the GNP deflator
is likely to dip to less than a 3-1/2 per cent rate of increase by the
second quarter.
Outlook for prices and resource use
The rise in industrial production in late 1968 exceeded
earlier anticipations and the index for the fourth quarter is now
expected to average close to 167.5, up at an annual rate of more than
5 per cent from the third quarter. Business efforts to reduce the
recent excessive rate of inventory accumulation are likely to accompany
a moderation of final demand pressures in the first half of this year,
acting to slow the rise in industrial production.
At yearend, at an estimated 84.5 per cent, the rate of manu-
facturing capacity utilization was up appreciably from the summer low,
but not quite up to the level prevailing from mid-1967 to mid-1968.
With a shading off of the production rise now in prospect in the first
half, the rate of capacity utilization will probably recede moderately
again.

I -3
Demand for labor continued very strong through December,
partly reflecting the upturn in manufacturing employment in recent
months but mainly because of continuing rapid growth outside manufac-
turing. The unemployment rate last month remained at the 15-year low
of 3.3 per cent reached in November.
There appears to be no let-up yet in labor pressure for
large wage increases. First-year wage increases in early 1969 will
probably continue the high 1968 pattern. However, with relatively few
new settlements scheduled this year some easing of upward pressure on
average wages in manufacturing can be expected--not enough, however,
to avoid resumption of increases in unit labor costs in view of a
probable slowing in production and productivity increases.
Prices of industrial commodities at wholesale and consumer
prices generally continue to rise at a rapid pace. An exceptionally
large flurry of industrial price increases takes effect early this month.
In general, current strong upward price movements reflect accumulated
labor and other cost increases, strong business investment demands, and
pervasive expectations of persistence of inflationary pressures. As
the latter recede under the weight of excessive inventories, monetary
and fiscal restraint, and shifting expectations, price increases are
likely to slacken.
Outlook for supply of funds
The further rise in the prime rate at major banks to 7 per
cent appears to have been triggered more by the developing squeeze on

I -4
funds available at banks than by any exceptional strength in loan
demands. In addition to the heavy continuing run-off of their CD's,
major banks have been forced to pay as much as 8 per cent on call money
borrowed in the Euro-dollar market, and the availability of these funds
has apparently been somewhat constricted, although to some extent
perhaps only temporarily. In December, CD attrition at all banks
amounted to about $1.3 billion. If rates on short-term market instru-
ments remain close to or above their new recent highs, CD run-off in
January could easily be as large as in December, with the bulk of the
decline continuing to be centered on the largest money market banks.
Smaller regional banks, which have focused heavily on less interest-
sensitive customer-oriented deposits, seem more likely to be able to
continue rolling-over the bulk of their prospective maturities.
Inflows of consumer-type time and savings deposits at commer-
cial banks are also likely to shrink from their rapid pace of late 1968,
in view of the record yields on competitive market instruments and the
reduced consumer savings rate projected for the first quarter. Inquiries
at banks by savers interested in obtaining high yielding Treasury secur-
ities, and the increase in the size of the non-competitive tender in the
most recent Treasury bill auction suggest that the levels to which yields
have now moved are again eliciting an interest in transfers of savings
to market securities.
Inflows of savings to nonbank thrift institutions are also
likely to be increasingly affected by this desire of the public for
higher interest earnings, particularly during the crucial dividend

I-5
reinvestment period now underway. While information thus far available
on thrift institution experience does not suggest any sharp deteriora-
tion in the early days of the reinvestment period, this evidence is too
fragmentary to support a firm conclusion about the whole period. In any
event, with a record volume of commitments already outstanding at savings
and loan associations and savings banks, these institutions can be
expected to cut back further on new commitments in the period ahead, and
to repay borrowings in less than usual seasonal amounts. These possi-
bilities, which have recently been accentuated by the likelihood of more
than seasonal reduction in mortgage takings by commercial banks, suggest
that upward pressure on mortgage yields will continue.
Demand deposits at banks are also expected to expand at a
slower rate than they did in the fourth quarter. With GNP projected
to rise at a reduced pace, need for transactions balances should moderate.
In addition, demand balances would normally be under some pressure as a
result of high yields on competing instruments and the reduced avail-
ability of credit. Finally, a further drain on private deposits will
develop in January as Treasury balances are built-up by new cash financ-
ing.
Credit demand outlook
Credit demands at banks and in securities markets, while
likely to remain fairly strong during January and February, are not
expected to be significantly larger than they have been--taken in toto.
A large source of demand will be the Federal Government, which in this

I-6
month and next will need to raise $3 to 4 billion of new money. Market
pressures arising from this borrowing should be moderated, however, by
the outlook for unusually heavy seasonal Treasury debt repayment start-
ing in late March and running through June.
Bond volume in both corporate and municipal markets is also
expected to be relatively large in January and February. In the case
of corporate issues, public offerings are likely to average slightly
above the 1968 pace. Although it is possible that increasing concern
about the general availability of funds will lead to additional, antic-
ipatory borrowing, some businesses with firm lines of credit already
secured at banks may very well defer capital market borrowing in the
hope of obtaining lower rates later on. In the case of the tax-exempt
market, with the flood of industrial revenue offerings now halted, new
issue volume seems likely to fall short of last year's record pace.
Growing constraints on bank participation, along with the further rise
in bond yields set-off by the latest prime rate increase, may well lead
to further postponements. Even so, general State and local government
demands for funds appear to be strong enough to maintain the volume of
new issues at a relatively high level.
Expansion of business loans at banks in January is expected
to be relatively moderate, aside from a very large participated loan to
facilitate the Atlantic-Sinclair merger early in the month. For the
quarter as a whole, business financing requirements are still expected to
be fairly sizable, although some slowing in the rise of plant and equipment
expenditures, and inventory accumulation is anticipated. The further rise in the

I- 7
prime rate, together with more selective policies currently being
adopted by some large banks, should help to restrain the rate of new
borrowing at banks.
With overall credit demands not expected to show any signif-
icant tendency to accelerate, the near-term course of interest rates
will continue to be especially sensitive to changes in supplies of funds
and to marginal shifts in market expectations. Even before the latest
change in the prime rate, market participants apparently were being
pulled in two directions on their outlook for interest rates. Question
was being raised, on the one hand, whether incompatibility between the
recent trend of consumer spending and projected business spending might
lead to a slowing of the latter. On the other hand, the extent of the
squeeze on major banks in CD and Euro-dollar markets was being watched
carefully for signs of a developing credit crunch. Following a period
of adjustment to the prime rate change, interest rate movements in the
weeks ahead will depend importantly on how the balance between these two
influences on expectations actually appears to be working out.

I -8
Balance of payments outlook
Partly in consequence of the East Coast and Gulf ports
strike that began December 20, no early improvement can be expected
in the merchandise trade balance or in net exports of goods and serv-
ices. In the three months September-November the trade surplus was
under $1 billion, annual rate. By the second quarter, the rise in
exports -- boosted by a post-strike catch-up -- and in investment
income receipts should begin to exceed growth in payments for imports
and other net current transactions.
Very large private and official capital inflows at the year-
end swung the over-all balance on the liquidity basis into surplus for
the fourth quarter. The private capital inflows appear to have been
much larger than the control programs for banks and direct investors
required. Since they had their counterpart mainly in a decline in lia-
bilities of U.S. banks to their foreign branches, the year-end inflows
had little effect on the official settlements balance.
The near-term outlook for flows of foreign private capital is
in many respects obscure. There is little likelihood of further expan-
sion in foreign purchases of U.S. equities, which have been very large
in recent months. In the short-term funds markets, U.S. banks have
recent been bidding up Euro-dollar interest rates to unusually high
levels, but whether large supplies of funds will be obtainable through
the Euro-dollar market is doubtful in view of the cessation of large
withdrawals from sterling and the French franc.

THE ECONOMIC PICTURE IN DETAIL
The Nonfinancial Scene
Gross national product. The rise in current dollar GNP in
the quarter just ended apparently exceeded the $18 billion increase in
the previous quarter. However, the past three months were characterized
by mixed signs of strength and weakness in the private economy, and by
a leveling-off in Federal expenditures. Outlays for residential con-
struction turned up, investment in plant and equipment apparently rose
strongly and the rate of inventory accumulation accelerated sharply.
But consumer outlays increased only about half as much as in the third
quarter, and the rise in total final sales is estimated at about $15
billion compared with over $21 billion in the previous quarter.
Economic expansion is expected to slow markedly over the
first half of this year, as business adjusts production to a continua-
tion of the more moderate rise in final sales which characterized the
fourth quarter. Inventory accumulation, which contributed substantially
to the rise in GNP in the fourth quarter is likely to be curtailed as
stocks become top-heavy, and firmer credit restraint also will limit
investment, particularly in residential construction.
Slackening in consumer demand for goods in the fourth quarter
was general. There was no rise at all in durable goods outlays--unit
sales of domestic autos declined somewhat in November from the peak
October rate of 9.1 million and fell substantially further in December
to a rate of only 8.2 million. This reduced the average annual rate of

II -2
sales from 9.0 million in the third quarter to 8.7 million in the
fourth. Nondurable goods sales were not much above mid-summer levels
in November and apparently also in December.

Some potential sales of both durable and nondurable goods
may have been lost in December because of the influenza epidemic. But
the easing of consumer demand in the fourth quarter likely reflected
the more moderate growth of disposable income after midyear and perhaps
also reluctance of consumers, who had cut their saving rate sharply in
the third quarter, to reduce it further in the fourth. In addition,
the intensification of inflationary fears in the fourth quarter may have
been a factor. Expectations of inflation apparently make consumers
apprehensive; somewhat paradoxically, rather than buying more heavily,
they tend to save for precautionary reasons. The latest Michigan survey
of consumer attitudes taken in November and early December indicates
that people do not regard the present as a favorable time to buy big-
ticket items.

II -3
Businessmen, on the other hand, appear to have been more
optimistic than consumers. Outlays for construction and fixed invest-
ment rose briskly in the fourth quarter. Manufacturers' new orders for
machinery and equipment apparently averaged substantially higher than
in the third quarter as did industrial output; unemployment was lower
as employment climbed further.
The rate of inventory accumulation rose substantially in the
fourth quarter from the moderate third quarter pace. The book value of
inventories in October-November rose at an annual rate of about $15
billion, more than half of which was in trade. Moreover, in view of an
estimated easing in retail sales in December and a further sizable
increase in industrial production, it seems likely that there was a
further climb of substantial proportions. Thus, even after allowing
for inventory valuation, we have estimated that nonfarm business inven-
tories may have been accumulated at an annual rate of $12 billion last
quarter. The faster pace of inventory-building is estimated to have
added as much as $4.5 billion to increase in GNP, whereas, in the pre-
ceding quarter, a decline in the annual rate of accumulation subtracted
nearly $3.5 billion.
Capital investment is also believed to have contributed
significantly to economic growth in the fourth quarter, even if--as we
assume--the ambitious plans of businessmen for spending in the fourth
quarter were not fully realized. The projected climb from last spring
is one of the fastest on record, and is particularly noteworthy in view
of the absence of those factors which are usually associated with a

II -4
capital goods boom, such as capacity shortages, or a preceding period
of under-investment. The explanation seems to lie largely in longer-
run optimism and in current and prospective rising costs of capital
goods. With wages expected to continue to rise at a substantial rate,
efforts to reduce unit labor costs also have been an important considera-
tion.
The rise in residential construction outlays in October-
December reflected a step-up in housing starts that began in the third
quarter, and the further climb--probably to over 1.60 million--in the
fourth quarter. Fourth quarter starts were higher than previously
expected despite a firming in mortgage interest rates in November and
December. The pick-up seems to be due in part to a desire of builders
to accelerate take-down of the large outstanding backlog of mortgage
commitments in order to avoid possible cancellations. An attempt to
take advantage of commitments promptly could mean that the advanced
November rate of 1.7 million starts might continue for several months
until monetary restraint exerts pressure on the ability of mortgage
institutions to carry out commitments at this rate.
Although the rise in current dollar GNP in the fourth quarter
may have exceeded that of the third quarter, the rate of real growth
may have edged down reflecting a rise in the GNP deflator from 3.4 per
cent--2.8 per cent excluding the Federal pay raise in the third quarter--
to 3.9 per cent, which is about the average rise in the first half of
the year. (We have not been able to reconcile the sharp dip in the

II -5
deflator in the third quarter, as officially estimated, with changes in
major price series even after adjustment for comparability.)
In the current quarter, the rise in current dollar GNP is
likely to be reduced to a rate of about $14 billion, and the rate of
real growth may fall from almost 5 per cent to about 2-1/2 per cent.
The decline from the fourth quarter would result largely from a decline
in the rate of inventory accumulation after the fourth quarter step-up.
By comparison, final sales are expected to continue to rise at approx-
imately the fourth quarter rate. With starts at higher levels and
commitments still large, residential construction outlays may rise
somewhat further, while expenditures for plant and equipment are likely
to continue sharply upward in view of expanded order backlogs and current
plans for higher spending.
But gains in personal consumption expenditures are likely to
continue moderate. Increases in disposable income this quarter are
expected to be moderated by the January boost in social security taxes
and by higher retroactive income tax payments. As a result, even with
some further reduction in the rate of saving, the volume of consumption
is not likely to be much greater than in the fourth quarter.
By the second quarter, the slowdown in the economy should be
more perceptible, both in a smaller gain in current dollar GNP--which
may be at a rate of around $11 billion--and in a further dip in the
real growth to about 1-1/2 per cent. The imbalance between inventories
and sales should be reflected in a further decline in the rate of inven-
tory accumulation and in a slower rise of industrial production. In

II -6
addition, tight conditions in the mortgage market seem likely to bring
a reduction in housing starts in the second quarter to a rate of about
1.5 million units, and residential construction expenditures should
begin to decline. Nor does it seem likely that the rate of expansion
in investment in plant and equipment will be sustained. Consumer spend-
ing is also likely to show little vigor as the flow of personal income
expands but slowly in response to production cut-backs and as tax pay-
ments are swollen further by "clean-up" payments on 1968 liabilities.
Although Federal expenditures for defense and other goods
and services are leveling off, rising outlays for transfer payments,
interest, and other items required by statute are still expanding.
However, receipts have been rising more rapidly than expenditures since
mid-1968, replacing the $10 billion (NIA) deficit of the second quarter
with a small surplus last quarter; the surplus should continue to grow
reaching an estimated annual rate of $6.5 billion in the second quarter.

Industrial production. Industrial production in December is
tentatively estimated to have increased about one per cent further from
the preliminary November level of 167.4 per cent. At 169, the December
index would be up 4 per cent from December a year earlier; for 1968 as
a whole, the index would be about 4.4 per cent above 1967. Growth in
industrial production in 1968 was thus much more in line with the long-
term trend of 4.1 per cent than the 7.1 per cent average annual rate of
increase in the period 1961-1966.

Output gains in December are estimated to have been stronger
for business equipment and industrial materials than for consumer goods.
Auto assumblies were reduced to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
8.9 million units from a rate of 9.2 million in October and November.
With sales of new domestic autos down to an 8.2 million rate in December
and stocks at new highs, production schedules for January have been cut
10 per cent from earlier plans to an annual rate of 8.3 million units.
In December, output of television sets was reduced again as inventories
remained high in relation to sales.

II -10
Production of most business equipment lines is expected to
show further advances in line with the estimated increase in business
expenditures on new capital equipment. Bolstering the upward movement
of output of equipment has been a turn-around in production of farm and
railroad equipment in the second half of 1968, following 1-1/2 years of
decline amounting to 25 and 55 per cent, respectively.
Output of raw steel increased 10 per cent further in December
and presumably production of steel mill shapes and forms also continued
upward. Output of iron and steel is estimated to have been around
125 per cent of the 1957-59 average, up almost 20 per cent from the
September-October low but 15 per cent below the midyear high which had
been augmented by anticipation of a strike.
Capacity utilization. The December rate of manufacturing
capacity utilization is estimated to be up further from the 84.1 per
cent of November. This would be the third consecutive monthly increase
and would return the operating rate to within a few tenths of a point
of the level which prevailed last spring. The recovery of iron and
steel and production again accounted for much of the increase in the
operating rate. Production in the remainder of manufacturing increased
only slightly further than capacity.
Utilization rates are above normal in the motor vehicle,
aircraft, rubber, petroleum and nonferrous metals industries. Unused
capacity remains appreciable for production of most other manufacturing
products.

Unit auto sales and stocks. Sales of new domestic autos
declined further in the last selling period in December and for the
month as a whole were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 8.2 million
units, down 7 per cent from November but 11 per cent above the strike-
reduced level of a year earlier. Sales in 1968 totaled 8.6 million
units, up 13 per cent from 1967, which was affected by shortages due to
strikes. Sales of imported cars totaled over 950,000 units, a new
record and about one-fourth larger than in 1967. Thus, combined sales
of domestic and imported cars in 1968 totaled 9.6 million units, of
which imported cars accounted for 10 per cent.
Stocks of new domestic autos declined somewhat over the
month. With sales down considerably, however, the inventory-sales ratio
rose to a 56 days' supply, compared with 49 days at the end of 1967.
Consumer credit. Consumer use of instalment debt tapered
off somewhat in November, although still remaining at a very high level.
Credit outstanding increased during November at an annual rate of

II -12
$10 billion, compared to the $11.4 billion rate of increase in October
(all figures on seasonally adjusted basis) The rate of growth for
automobile, personal, and repair and modernization loans slowed. Only
in the category "other consumer goods" loans did the rate of increase
exceed that experienced in October. In this category, credit extended
by retailers was especially strong, reflecting record GAF sales in
November.
The November consumer credit figures are compared in the
table with those of other periods. (All figures have just been revised
to new benchmarks.)

Consumer sentiment and buying intentions. Willingness of
consumers to spend their growing incomes has not changed in the last

II -13
1/three quarters, according to the index of consumer sentiment- constructed
by the Michigan Survey Research Center. Based on interviews between
November 11 and December 13, the index for all families was 92.1 (February
1966 = 100), not significantly different from the 92.4 of May 1968 and
the 92.9 of August 1968. The expression of intentions to buy new automo-
biles, however, was at a record high.
On the positive side, consumers in the latest survey were
more optimistic than in August about business trends, both in the coming
year and over the next five years. About 10 per cent of the respondents
attribute this optimism to what the new Administration may be able to do,
about the same percentages as in 1952 and 1960 when there were also
changes in Administration. (More people than in 1952 and 1960, however,
now think that business conditions may be bad because of a different
Administration.)
On the negative side, although there was no change in the
proportion of families reporting that they were either better off or
worse off during 1968 than a year earlier, the proportion of families
in November-December expecting to be better off in the next twelve months
was lower than at any time during the last two years. (The latest Census
1/ The index of consumer sentiment is constructed from the responses
of consumers to five questions, two relating to the evaluation of
personal financial trends, two to the general economic outlook, and
one to whether it is a good time to buy durable goods. The responses
to each question are scored on a net change basis, i.e., favorable
responses minus unfavorable responses. The five questions are
equally weighted and the total converted to a base in which the
responses in February 1966 equaled 100.

II -14
Survey of income expectations also had shown a deterioration.) More-
over, consumers' evaluation of whether it is a good time to buy cars,
large household goods, and houses were also lower than in any other
quarter in 1967 or 1968. Special questions asked on the survey, but
not incorporated in the index of consumer sentiment, suggest that
inflationary fears are the explanation of both the lower evaluation of
personal financial prospects and the unfavorable buying conditions for
consumer durables.
Despite this attitude regarding price increases, when consumers
were asked directly about their intentions to purchase a new car, a
larger proportion indicated that they intended to buy than at any time
in the last four years. Responses to questions regarding the styling
and special features of the 1969 models were more favorable than in any
of the preceding three years.
In the opinion of the Survey Research Center, either less
inflation or peace in Vietnam would substantially raise the proportion
of after-tax income which consumers are willing to spend rather than
save. This judgment is based on special survey questions asked over a
period of more than 20 years which suggest that when consumers are
worried about inflation they are more conservative in making discretionary
purchases for durables. The Survey Research Center did not cite any
particular survey results as the basis for their views about probable
consumer reaction to peace, but since inflation and war are closely asso-
ciated their inference may be reasonable.

Inventories and orders. Total inventory accumulation con-
tinued substantial in November, and for October and November combined
book values increased by an average of over $1.2 billion, or close to
$15 billion at an annual rate. Manufacturing inventories in November
rose by $600 million, somewhat larger than the October (downward)
revised increase of $450 million, but still not as high as the rate of
accumulation anticipated by manufacturers for the fourth quarter as a
whole. Trade inventories in November rose about $450 million and the
October-November monthly average increase was $700 million, compared
with $200 million in the third quarter. Automotive and general mer-
chandise stores showed the largest November increases.
Inventory-sales ratios continue at somewhat reduced levels
for manufacturing, wholesale, and nondurable retail trade. At durable
goods retailers, the ratio rose in October and November and is the
highest since April 1967.

II -16
New orders for durable goods in November declined 2 per cent
following the sharp 7 per cent increase in October, but were still at
a very high level and the backlog of unfilled orders rose 1 per cent.
The ratio of unfilled orders to shipments increased slightly in durable
goods industries, mainly as a result of increases in the primary and
fabricated metals industries. Strong demands for metals evidently
reflect high consumption and anticipation of price rises. A high level
of shipments is reducing the backlog-shipments ratio in defense and
business equipment industries; the continued reduction in this ratio
suggests that a strong inventory buildup in this area is unlikely.
Construction and real estate. Seasonally adjusted value of
new construction put in place turned upward in December to a new peak
annual rate of $87.6 billion./ Nearly all of the rise was concentrated
in outlays for private residential construction, which reached a new
high under the impetus of a renewed advance in housing starts in
November. Outlays for nonresidential construction apparently held near
the moderately reduced November rate and just below the high reached
last October. Public construction expenditures, after a downward bench-
mark revision averaging nearly 5 per cent over the June-November period,
also rose in December, but remained below the peak now set at last
February.
1/ This was associated with a 1 per cent downward revision in the
overall level for November and other recent months mainly because
of adjustments for public construction.

1/ Seasonally adjusted annual rates; preliminary. Data for the most
recent month (December) are confidential Census Bureau extrapola-

For 1968 as a whole, outlays for new construction exceeded
$84 billion, 11 per cent more than a year earlier, owing mainly to a
20 per cent advance in expenditures for residential construction.
Since the year-to-year rise in construction costs, as estimated by the
Census Bureau, averaged 5 per cent, all of the current-dollar increase
for private nonresidential structures (5 per cent) and most of the rise
for public construction (8 per cent) appear to have reflected increased
costs rather than changes in physical activity.
Seasonally adjusted private housing starts, which had dipped
in October, reversed direction in November and reached an annual rate
of 1.68 million, the highest since February 1964. Single-family starts,
as expected, dropped in November for technical reasons. But starts in
the highly volatile multifamily sector spurted upward by nearly a third
to a new high. On a regional basis, the increase from October to
November was concentrated, with total starts in the South up a fourth

II -18
to the highest rate reported for this region in the Census series which
began in 1959.

1/ Seasonally adjusted annual rates; preliminary.
A 1.68 million unit rate of starts hardly seems sustainable
over the long run under present or anticipated funds-flow conditions.
However, mortgage commitments outstanding in recent months have been
at record levels and building permits have also been relatively high at
a time when shelter-demands and upward cost pressures have remained
extremely strong. Under these circumstances and given the uncertainties
raised by the strong signals of further tightening in mortgage and other
financial markets, builders may be expected to resist the sharp winter
drop in unadjusted starts usual at this season. Usually this amounts to
as much as 25 per cent from November through February. If builders
succeed in these efforts, starts on a seasonally adjusted basis may hold
for a time at or even above the advanced November rate.

II -19
For the fourth quarter of 1968 as a whole, there is the
possibility of an average seasonally adjusted rate of starts in excess
of 1.6 million. This suggests a total for the year 1968 of about 1.53
million units or more than a fifth above the improved 1967 level and
the same as in 1964. It also suggests a 1968 total for multifamily
starts of as much as 615,000 units, a new high both absolutely and as
a proportion (40 per cent) of total starts.
An additional factor which may influence real estate and
mortgage market demands in 1969 is the second stage of the open-housing
law which became effective at the start of the year. The previous
stage of the law, passed last April, affected only certain Government-
assisted dwellings estimated at about 900,000 units. The new stage,
however, applies to most apartment units and to all new single-family
homes in subdivisions and developments, aggregating around 20 million
housing units or nearly a third of the total stock. In addition to
other conditions affecting sales- and rental-transactions, this stage
of the act also forbids racial or religious discrimination by mortgage
lenders.
Personal income. Estimates of personal income show a slower
rise in October and November--averaging $3.6 billion at annual rates--
than in the third quarter when there was an extremely rapid average
monthly gain of $5.3 billion. Since employment and hourly earnings rose
strongly in December, a somewhat larger pickup in personal income is
anticipated than in the two preceding months. In addition, upward

II -20
revisions of both November and October employment estimates suggest
that personal income increases for these months also may be adjusted
upward. Nevertheless, the personal income rise for the fourth quarter
as a whole is unlikely to be as large as in the two preceding quarters.

Increases in wage and salary payments averaged $2.3 billion
in October and November, down about one-third from the average increase
over the summer and fall. The largest drop occurred in nonmanufacturing,
where the third quarter rise included the Federal pay raise. In November,
earnings growth reflected smaller gains in virtually all industries,
apparently as an outgrowth of shortened workweeks--the workweek in
private industry fell in November but edged back up in December.
Labor market. The labor market continued extremely tight
through December. A sizable labor force increase was matched by strong
job gains and the unemployment rate remained at its 15-year low of
3.3 per cent. (Confidential until released Thursday, January 9th.)

II -21
Wage increases also continued large, with hourly earnings averaging
more than 7 per cent above year-earlier levels.
Nonfarm payroll employment rose strongly in December and,
significantly, the increases for October and November reported earlier
were revised upward. After showing little change last summer, manu-
facturing employment has risen strongly since September, with the
largest gains in machinery and fabricated metals. Construction employ-
ment has also been in a sharp uptrend since summer, rising by approxi-
mately 100,000 since September in response to strengthening demands.

* Adjusted for major strikes.
The average workweek in manufacturing declined from about
41 hours in September and October to 40.7 hours in December. The reduc-
tion reflected modest cutbacks in most industries and may reflect attempts
to reduce expensive overtime.
With demand strong in industrial and construction activities,
the supply of unemployed adult men was reduced further in December and
their jobless rate edged down to 1.8 per cent, a post-World War II low.

II -22
Jobless rates for married men (1.4 per cent), and craftsmen (1.9 per
cent) also reached new lows.
The unemployment rate for adult women, at 3.5 per cent in
December, continued about as low as at any time since the Korean War.
Further reductions in the jobless rate for adult women probably will
be limited since a large portion of the rate is frictional--women
entering and reentering the labor force.
Despite the scarce supply of adult male workers and strong
demand conditions, joblessness continues very high among teenagers.
Their rate, at 12.6 per cent in December, was half again as high as
during the Korean War and has not shown any signs of a pronounced down-
trend this year. The absence of significant improvement in teenage
unemployment may reflect the fact that over half of the unemployed
teenagers were still in school and seeking part-time employment and
that approximately one-third had never held a job before.
With the labor market very tight, wage rates have continued
to rise at a rapid pace. Hourly earnings of production and nonsuper-
visory workers on private payrolls were up to $2.93 in December, an
increase of 20 cents (7.3 per cent) from a year earlier. Increases
continued large in all industry groups.

II -24
Collective bargaining. In 1969, about 2.7 million workers
are covered by contracts involving renegotiation of wages--nearly
two million fewer than last year--and a record 6 million will receive
deferred wage increases (i.e., contractually specified second
or third year raises). The median deferred wage increase scheduled
to go into effect is 4.1 percent compared to a now typical first-year
wage increase of 7-1/2 per cent. Because of the small proportion
of workers who will receive newly negotiated, or first-year, wage
increases and the large proportion who will receive the smaller
deferred increases, the average increase for workers covered by
major collective bargaining agreements should be appreciably
smaller in 1969 than 1968.
First-year wage increases averaging aoout 7.5 per cent
became general early in 1968 and this pattern persisted throughout
the year. With consumer prices still rising rapidly, it seems
likely that the front-loading of wage increases will continue to
be a major feature of contract settlements in the months ahead as
workers attempt to catch up with past increases in living costs.
In current negotiations in the oil refining industry, wage demands
of the 60,000 member union continue this pattern. The union called
a strike beginning January 4 but because the industry is highly auto-
mated, it is expected that production will continue at about current
levels as supervisory personnel take over production jobs. Negotia-
tions are also in progress for 50,000 mechanics employed by 8
major airlines.

II -25
No agreement on a new contract has been reached by the long-
shoremen and East and Gulf Coast shippers, and mord than 50,000 dock
workers have been on strike since December 20. Two major issues
remain to be settled; the jurisdiction of the longshoremen over
loading and unloading containers, and the employers' guarantee of
a minimum number of working hours annually. Agreement has apparently
been reached, according to newspaper reports, on a wage and fringe
package estimated at $1.60 per hour over a 3-year contract period.
This would amount to an average annual increase in hourly compensation
in the neighborhood of 10 per cent.
Wholesale prices. The rise in wholesale prices of industrial
commodities, which was resumed in late summer following a period of
little change last spring and early summer, continues at a sizable
pace. Complete reports for November show a 0.2 per cent increase
in the industrial average in that month--up from the earlier estimate
of 0.1 per cent; the BLS estimates an 0.3 per cent increase in
December; and a wave of price increases announced over the past month
or so suggests an even larger increase in January.
Altogether, the BLS industrial commodity index increased 1.3
per cent from July to December (as now estimated)--or at an annual
rate of 3.1 per cent, about the same as the run-up in the corresponding
period of 1967. For the year 1968 the rise averaged 2.5 per cent, as
compared with 1.5 per cent in 1967 when industrial prices showed
virtually no change over the entire first half year.

II -26
Upward revision of the BLS November industrial price
estimates was concentrated mainly in machinery and equipment--
providing further confirmation of the resurgence in that sector--
and in textiles and apparel--where price increases have been
exceptionally large at wholesale and retail in recent months. The
over-all November rise was limited by a 1.3 per cent decline in prices
of steel mill products, attributable entirely to the very sharp
abortive cut for hot-rolled steel sheets. Apart from steel, industrial
prices rose nearly 0.3 per cent.
The 0.3 per cent further increase now estimated for December
was heavily dominated by the continuing extraordinary rise in lumber
and plywood prices. With softwood lumber up 3 per cent further and
softwood plywood prices jumping 20 per cent, lumber and plywood
combined accounted for nearly two-thirds of the total increase in
the industrial average. Over the past two years, average lumber
and plywood prices have now increased nearly 40 per cent, with over
a third of the rise coming since last July.
In November, as noted in the last Green Book, the diffusion
of price increases diminished moderately from the high October level--
reversing the upswing that began in August. In December, the total
number of product classes showing advances decreased considerably
further. Apart from the lumber group, the chief increases reported
were for nonferrous metals, steel scrap, and machinery and equipment.

II -27
The December industrial price estimate may well be subject
to upward revision. Thus the present confidential estimate of an
0.1 per cent increase in machinery and equipment prices last month
is unusually small compared with the increases reported for other
recent months; in November the original estimate of an 0.2 per
cent increase was later revised to an 0.4 per cent increase--more
in line with the rate of increase from August to October.
But, the BLS December pricing date, the 10th, was too
early to catch some increases announced in late November and early
December. An unusually large collection of price increases appear
to be taking effect by this month's BLS pricing date (the 14th).
Products affected include--in addition to a variety of metals and
metal products referred to in the paragraph below--asbestos;
refractory products, a number of chemicals, glass fibers and yarns,
glass containers, folding cartons, envelope paper, newsprint, carpets,
new autos (to cover headrests), and various types of machinery.
A major item in the industrial price rise to be reported
for this month is the restoration by steel mills of most of the
sharp cut in hot-rolled steel sheets made in early November, and
the boosting of prices of a number of steel mill products not
raised last August (including some affected by the recent large increase
in the price of nickel). It is possible that average prices of
steel mill products will show a rise of nearly 2 per cent this month
(accounting for roughly 0.1 per cent in the industrial commodity

II -28
total), to a level around 0.5 per cent above September--October
and 3 per cent above last July. In addition, copper markets
appear to be "boiling over" again. Unexpectedly high business
activity in Europe, as well as in the U.S., has been putting
pressure on copper prices, with stocks still limited by last
year's domestic strike. Prices of copper scrap and foreign copper
have been increasing in recent months, and just recently one
minor and two major domestic producers have raised the price of
domestic primary copper, from the 42 cents per 1b. established last
April following settlement of the strike, to 45 cents and 44 cents,
respectively. Copper and brass mills meanwhile have scheduled
price increases on virtually all types of products.
Consumer prices. The consumer price index rose 0.4 per
cent in November to 123.4 per cent of the 1957-59 average, 4.8
per cent above a year earlier. This is the largest year-over-year
rise since 1951.
The October-to-November rise was less than the unusually
large October increase of 0.6 per cent and it appears likely that
the December index will show no more than the November increase--
and perhaps less. Nevertheless, thanks in large part to the
extraordinary October spurt, the increase in the CPI for the
fourth quarter as a whole, on a seasonally adjusted basis and
excluding mortgage interest charges for rough comparability with
the GNP deflator for consumption expenditures, will undoubtedly
exceed the third quarter increase.

II -29
Both with and without allowances for usual seasonal changes
average retail prices of consumer products showed much less rise in
November than in October. Food prices, which had spurted contra-
seasonally in October, showed about the usual seasonal decline in
November. Prices of nes autos, which had increased 4.5 per cent in
October--1 per cent more than expected seasonally--showed about the
usual 1 per cent further seasonal rise in November. Moreover, the
rise in apparel prices--although continuing at a greater-than-seasonal
pace--slackened off appreciably from the extraordinarily rapid August-
October rate of increase.
Average prices of consumer services on the other hand,
increased considerably more in November than in October (0.6 per
cent vs. 0.4 per cent), mainly because of a large jump in "utilities
and public transportation." The latter reflected a sharp spurt in
gas rates, due to the quasi-seasonal (and archaic) institution of
higher winter rates in 2 cities; increases in water and sewerage
charges; and higher local transit rates in 5 cities. Costs of
medical and most other services continued up at about the sizable
pace of other recent months.
A jump in "home purchase costs" also contributed signi-
ficantly to the November increase in the CPI. This is an unpublished
(and confidential) component classified under, and accounting for
one-third of the wieght of, the regularly published "durable

II -30
commodities" index; but it should more properly be classified as a
service. The increases in home purchase costs and in utilities
and public transportation services, which together account for a
little more than one tenth of the CPI base-period weight, accounted
for roughly one-third of the November rise in the CPI.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL SITUATION
Bank credit. Expansion of total loans and investments at
all commercial banks in December, on an end of month basis, is estimated
to have continued at about the reduced rate of growth in November,
despite a Treasury financing and increased corporate tax payments.
Moreover, with the exception of the small financing-related increase
in bank holdings of U. S. Government securities, the increase in all
other major categories of bank loans and investments moderated sub-
stantially from the pace of recent months.

III -2
Following a large decline in November, bank holdings of
U. S. Government securities were up slightly in December as banks
underwrote nearly all of a $2 billion Treasury financing early in
the month. Although banks apparently retained a larger-than-usual
amount of these tax bills--probably in part a response to the rising
level of bill rates over the month--they continued to liquidate
holdings of longer-term Governments.
Banks sharply reduced the rate at which they took other
securities into portfolio during December, as compared to the rapid
pace of recent months. Moreover, December acquisitions were more
concentrated in short-term municipals than in the previous two
months and may have reflected efforts by banks to become more liquid
in preparation for possible large CD run-offs.
Expansion of bank loans in December also slowed consider-
ably from the rapid rate that has generally prevailed since mid-year,
reflecting mainly reduced borrowing by both business and financial
sectors. Taken together, however, the November-December growth in
business loans remained at a substantial 13.5 per cent, and may have
reflected, in part, business borrowing to finance increased plant
and equipment expenditures and inventory accumulation.
Virtually all of the December increase in business loans
occurred during the tax and dividend period. While business borrow-
ing to meet tax payments was considerably larger than last year,

III -3
the ratio of business loans to corporate tax liabilities remained
about the same as in December 1967. By industry, only retail trade,
chemicals, and textiles showed unusual strength for the month as
a whole. Largely in response to rising interest rates--including
the mid-December increase in the discount rate--banks raised their
prime rates to 6.75 per cent in the latter part of the month and
to 7.0 per cent in early January.
Of the other major loan categories, only consumer and real
estate are estimated to have sustained the increased rate of growth
of recent months. Security loans declined for the third month in
a row as dealers reduced their positions sharply at month-end.
Bank deposits. Time and savings deposits at all commercial
banks, on a daily average basis, are estimated to have risen at
about a 14.5 per cent annual rate in December, only slightly below
the average monthly increase since mid-year. The December rise
reflects larger-than-usual CD inflows in late November and early
December as well as continued large inflows of consumer-type
deposits.

Although most large banks are reported to have been paying
maximum rates on all maturities of CD's since late November, they
were able to add somewhat to their outstandings in early December
and to keep run-offs during the tax and dividend period to about
normal proportions. However, as money market rates continued to rise,
CD ceilings became progressively more non-competitive, and banks--
particularly the major money market institutions--have found it
increasingly difficult to replace maturing issues. In the last two
weeks of the month, banks in New York and Chicago lost nearly $600
million in CD's, in sharp contrast to net increases in outstandings1968

in comparable periods of most recent years. Other banks, however,
where depositors are less interest sensitive and customer-bank relation-
ships are more important, were able to increase their outstanding CD's
in the week ending December 25. For the month as a whole, it is
estimated that all large banks had CD run-offs of about $1.3 billion,
some $500 million more than usual. Given current interest rate
relationships and the large amount of CD's maturing in January--$6.4
billion or about 27 per cent of total outstandings--it is likely
that major money market banks will experience serious CD attrition
in January.
With the high cost and apparent reduced availability of
Eurodollars, major banks have been either unwilling or unable to
utilize this source of funds to offset recent CD outflows. In the
four weeks ending January 1, bank liabilities to their foreign
branches fell by nearly $1.4 billion--approximately twice the usual
year-end decline--bringing the amount outstanding down to just over
$6 billion.
In spite of the recent increase in market rates of interest,
inflows of consumer-type deposits at large banks have continued to
be large. The December increase, however, was almost completely
concentrated in time certificates and open accounts, with passbook
savings deposits remaining virtually unchanged after having grown
appreciably in the previous two months. Savings deposit inflows
at country banks also were somewhat less than in comparable periods
of recent years. Apparently some funds have been diverted from
passbook savings as more banks have recently expanded the types of
time certificates and open accounts offered to the public.

After increasing rapidly in November, growth in the money
stock, measured on a daily average basis, slowed somewhat to about
a 7 per cent annual rate, while U.S. Government deposits declined
for the third consecutive month. The December increase brought
the growth in the money stock in the second half of the year to
6.1 per cent, compared with 6.6 per cent in the first half and
with 6.4 per cent over the year 1967.
Nonbank depositary intermediaries. Developments during the
current reinvestment period should provide an important test of the
ability of the thrift institutions to withstand the pull of the much
1/higher yields now available on market securities.- Only partial
data are available, but they suggest that so far the current outflow
is running only moderately higher than at the same time last year for
the savings banks; at savings and loans, outflows during the grace
period were 25 per cent larger than in the similar 1967 period, with
most all of the greater withdrawals accounted for by associations in
the San Francisco district. It should be noted, however, that
throughout 1968 the experience during the grace period before month-
end was not an accurate indicator of results for the total reinvest-
ment period, probably because of the increased importance of certificate
accounts that mature on a specified date.
1/ The reinvestment period consists of the last three business days in
December (grace days) and up to the first ten calendar days of January.

The Home Loan Banks reported that S&L demand for advances had
been substantially the same as it was last year. During November,
there was virtually no change in S&L borrowed funds outstanding, and
there was a seasonal rise in their liquidity ratios. Although out-
standing commtments continued high, they were less burdensome
relative to cash flow; in November the ratio of savings and loans'
outstanding commitments to three-month cash flows was slightly below
the previous low point this year, though higher than in any month
during 1967.
During November, the rate of growth in total savings at
the two major institutions slackened somewhat to the pace of the first
three quarters. The pattern showed divergence, as savings banks--
including those in New York--showed considerable strength and the
savings and loans showed a decline from the pace of the previous
three months; the deceleration of S&L inflows is now estimated to
have continued in December.

Mortgage market. Tightening in the sensitive secondary
market for FHA and VA home mortgages apparently continued through
the early part of the dividend reinvestment period. Along with the
increase in other capital market rates, implicit yields on FNMA's
6-month forward-purchase commitments rose further in recent weeks,
as shown in the table. By the January 6 auction, average secondary
market yields had returned close to the high posted early last June,
and were 50 basis points above the end-of-September low. This and
other developments indicated that discounts on these 6-3/4 per cent
Government-underwritten mortgages were becoming large enough to
increasingly limit the willingness of lenders to supply such credit
as well as the ability of market participants to absorb the costs.

In the primary home mortgage market, FNMA field reports made
toward the end of December suggested that credit demands (particularly
for conventional mortgages) were slackening, but by somewhat less than
the usual sharp seasonal amount. Under these circumstances, lenders in
most major areas were still able to accommodate the declining volume
of loan requests at exceptionally high interest rates. Even so, a
number of areas reported some tightening in credit availability last
month, as more lenders adopted a wait-and-see attitude about market
performance through the reinvestment period and the policies of the
incoming administration.

III -11
The total dollar volume of outstanding mortgage commitments
of all S&L's and New York State savings banks rose a little further in
November to a new high, after adjustment for seasonal variation,
despite a slight decline for S&L's alone. The aggregate commitment
backlog of both lenders--chiefly for residential mortgages--was 12
per cent above mid-year and 14 per cent above a year earlier when
average per-unit mortgage amounts were undoubtedly lower. The backlog
was equivalent to about a 4-month volume of mortgage takings at
the seasonally adjusted rate of loan closings reported by these
lenders in November.
Over 1968 as a whole, tentative estimates suggest that the
net increase in residential mortgage credit extended by all types of
lenders may have been as much as $2-1/2 billion larger than in 1967;
this expansion occurred despite a year-to-year drop during 1968 of
around $4-1/2 billion in aggregate net savings flows to all S&L's and
savings banks. Appendix A discusses in more detail how aggregate net
mortgage flows expanded in 1968 despite reduced savings inflows to the
thrift institutions, and points out some implications for 1969.
Corporate and municipal bond markets. From mid-December
through early January yields on corporate and municipal bonds fluctuated
in a narrow range around their 1968 highs. However, most of the
activity in the market had consisted of secondary market trading--
particularly tax swapping--and the absence of new issues had hindered
an accurate test of the current state of the market. The seasonal lull

III -12
in new issue activity during the year-end period, however, had the
constructive effect of giving dealers an opportunity to reduce their
bonds held in syndicate as well as adjust their inventory positions.
As a result, dealers bid aggressively for the new issues early this
week, but found sales to be very slow. Within minutes after the
awarding of a large Telephone issue Tuesday, the prime rate was
raised and generated a significant rise in yields. New offerings
of corporate and municipal bonds priced prior to the prime rate
action are unattractive and not likely to sell out at their original
terms.

Market participants have been focusing on the very heavy
volume of corporate bonds expected this month. Flotations of public
corporate bonds are estimated at $1.1 billion in January, nearly
double the December volume which was held down by seasonal factors
and by about $200 million of postponements. While the January
calendar has continued to build up recently, the bulk of the volume
nonetheless consists of utility issues whose January offering was
announced some time ago. Thus, it does not appear that this large
volume is significantly accounted for by recent decisions to borrow
in advance of needs, certainly not by industrial firms. Some issues,
however, may have been scheduled for January in hopes of catching
the typical yield downturn associated with the beginning of a new
year and an enlarged reinvestment demand. The total volume of
corporate security offerings, including private placements and stock
issues is estimated at $1.9 billion in January, slightly above the
1968 average monthly volume.

Looking farther ahead, the February calendar is currently
very light with only about $200 million of corporate bonds scheduled.
However, it seems likely that the ultimate volume of public offerings
in February will be in the $.8 billion to $1.0 billion range, given
underwriter reports of issues in the pipeline and the ample time
available to place issues on the February calendar. This would put
the February volume somewhat below that of January, partly due to
the unusual concentration in January of public utility issues--some
of which normally might have been scheduled for February.
In the municipal market, the December volume of new issues
totaled about $1.1 billion. Included in this volume were nearly
$400 million of industrial revenue issues, which represented the
final offerings of such issues over $5 million to receive tax-exemption
privileges. But the large volume of industrial issues was partially
offset by more than $250 million of postponements, so that the total
amount of offerings dropped significantly below the average monthly
volume for the year.

State and local government offerings in January and February
are tentatively estimated at $1.0 billion per month. These estimates
implicitly assume that there will continue to be a significant volume
of postponements, given current yield levels. (In the early days of
January about $100 million of new issues were postponed indefinitely.)
However, the volume might exceed current estimates if interest rates
decline significantly or if some borrowers accelerate their financing
plans.
Stock market. After reaching new highs in early December,
most common stock price indices levelled out, and, following the
increase in the discount rate (December 18), all moved moderately
downward. On Monday, January 6, price declines were pronounced in
all indexes and appeared to be widely distributed among issues. The
decline continued on Tuesday, accelerating after the increase in the
prime rate.
Owing to tax-motivated transactions, stock price movements
at the end of the year are often not indicative of underlying trends,
but developments among individual issues suggest that the shift to
additional monetary restraint--and the expectations for further
tightening--had some effect on prices. For example, several stocks
related to the housing industry, which had been advancing rapidly
until the discount rate increase, dropped over 10 per cent between
December 18 and the end of the year.

III -16
Until the holidays, trading volume had been extremely heavy;
the decline in activity during the weeks of Christmas and New Year
may well represent only a holiday lull. However, the industry felt
that the back-office problem had been reduced sufficiently to permit
the return to a 5-day trading week, which began January 2. Although
trading time each day was reduced 90 minutes--thereby reducing by
two the number of weekly trading hours from those allowed during the
4-day week-- the Securities and Exchange Commission has voiced dis-
pleasure with the new system. The SEC expects that the added day
allowed salesmen to encourage customer transactions will result in
greater volume despite the reduced number of hours available for
transactions. They point out, in support of their expectation, that
past experience with a reduced number of hours (August 1967) proved
unsuccessful.

Because of technical difficulties in data collection,
preliminary estimates of the level of margin debt at the end of
November are only now available. These very tentative figures
suggest that brokerage customers increased their margin debt by
about $70 million during that month of rapidly rising stock prices.
This was the first monthly increase since June, but since the
October outstanding debt was revised downward by a similar amount,
total outstanding debt remained at $6.3 billion. Purpose loans
to non-brokers (for both stocks and bonds) reported by large weekly-
reporting banks also rose about $70 million during November, and by
an additional $60 million last month.
Government securities market. Since the last meeting of
the Committee, the discount rate increase, firming of open market
policy, and two 1/4 point increases in the prime rate at banks, have
all combined to boost yields throughout the Government security list
to new record highs. After reaching an initial peak just before
Christmas , yields had retraced a sizable part of their initial run-
up by the start of the New Year, but the second move in the prime
rate--to 7 per cent--then raised most yields back, close to or above
their pre-Christmas peaks. Over the full period bill rate increase
range generally from 30 to 50 basis points, and coupon issues posted
advances of as much as 3/8 of a percentage point.

The abruptness of the yield mark-up on Treasury issues
reflected in large measure an intensification of pressures on major
money market banks. In the-face of heavy current and expected CD
attrition, resulting higher Federal funds rates,and sharply increased
rates on Euro-dollars, these banks boosted their new loan rates to
dealers to rates generally in excess of 6-1/2 per cent and on occasion
as high as 7-1/4 -7-1/2 per cent. With their financing costs at
these high levels, and with the lack of Federal Reserve action on
Regulation Q ceilings suggesting the possibility of a period of
relatively severe credit tightness, dealers became reluctant bidders
for securities and attempted to cut-back their existing inventories.
In coupon issues this latter process was made more difficult during
the closing weeks of the year by the fact that banks taking 1968 as
a capital loss year for tax purposes were attempting to liquidate
a sizable volume of longer maturities.

III -20
With the start of the new year, the weight of bank selling
in the coupon market was lifted. At the same time, some analysts
began to focus on the possible implications for interest rates later
in the year of the divergent trends that seemed to be developing
between consumer and business spending. With some market participants
sensitive to this latter view, and others focussing more on the
developing squeeze on banks, market expectations were being pulled
in two directions, and some investor demand for coupon issues
appeared. Most recently, the further increase in the prime rate
has apparently reemphasized market concern about the likely degree
of near-term credit squeeze, and contributed to the resulting
sharp back-up of yields.
Higher yields have on occasion attracted a fairly sizable
investor interest in bills. As shown in the accompanying table,
dealer bill positions declined by nearly $1.5 billion after
December 17, even though they took on awards of new issues in bill
auctions totalling $3.3 billion. Bank buying--primarily for
statement date purposes--was notably good; and some of the pick-up
in other investor interest reflected purchases by holders of maturing
CD's. Some scattered evidence of increased small investor interest
in Treasury bills has also developed recently. Although non-competive
bidding in bill auctions late in December was only about normal,
despite the sharp run-up of rates, the first regular auction of
1969 attracted a significantly greater than normal non-competitive
interest.

Federal finance. Current staff projections of Federal
receipts and outlays on a unified budget basis still show an estimated
deficit of $2 billion for fiscal year 1969, in contrast to President
Johnson's recent statement predicting a small surplus. The President's
statement reiterated a belief that fiscal year Federal spending will
be held down to the $184.4 billion figure first projected in the
Summer Budget Review. To become effective, however, this estimate
would require significant further cut-backs in Federal outlays, other
than transfer payments, over the remaining months of the year.
The Board staff estimate still assumes moderate increases
in Federal outlays from recent levels, mainly in Vietnam-related
defense spending. While the Treasury balance in the latter half of
December ran somewhat higher than the staff forecast, the extent
of the change does not suggest any reason to revise the earlier
estimate that fiscal year receipts will total nearly $185 billion,
slightly less than the figure implied in the President's statement.
Final Administration estimates of fiscal 1969 receipts and expen-
ditures to be shown in the January Budget Document are not yet
known.
Staff estimates of Treasury cash flows for the first quarter
of 1969 suggest that the Treasury may have to raise $3 to $4 billion
of additional new money before its balance is replenished by inflows
of tax receipts in March and April. The bulk of the new money need
will have to be met by early March. The first step in raising these
funds is expected to be an offering of perhaps $1.5 to $2.0 billion

III -24
of tax bills, with payment probably in the third week of January.
Additional funds could be raised at mid-February in connection
with the refunding of February note and bond maturities, $5.4
billion of which are held by the public.
Tax receipts expected in the latter half of March should
permit the Treasury to repay the $2.0 billion of tax bills that
mature on March 24, and still move into April with an operating cash
balance of about $4.0 billion. Over the remainder of the fiscal year
the Treasury is expected to accomplish debt repayment of $8.5 billion.

U.S. balance of payments. As a result of year-end receipts
far greater than anticipated, the balance of payments for the fourth
quarter of 1968, and for the year as a whole, registered a surplus on
both of the conventional measures. On the liquidity basis the balance
shifted into surplus about mid-December, after having registered a de-
ficit of about $1 billion in October-November (not seasonally adjusted).
In the final week of December a massive surplus of $1.6 billion was
reported,which yielded a surplus for the quarter (seasonally adjusted)
of about $1.2 billion. If this preliminary result is reasonably accu-
rate, the year will show a liquidity surplus of some $400 million.
Some of the improvement in December resulted from larger
receipts from foreign governments under financing arrangements worked
out by the Treasury, though for the entire quarter such receipts (shown
in the table that follows) were not markedly greater than in the pre-
ceding two quarters. In the fourth quarter there were also receipts
of over $200 million from investments in nonliquid assets by inter-
national institutions which had sold bonds in the U.S. market as well
as other receipts from governments not recorded in the table, such as
prepayments for arms purchases and repayments of certain loans, that
totalled about $200 million.

In addition, very large year-end receipts appear to have been
generated by U.S. private investors. Some of the banks shifted approxi-
mately $300 million of credits to foreigners from head office to branch
books (reducing both bank loans outstanding and liabilities to banks
abroad) and direct investor companies are believed to have repatriated
in the last week of the year more than $500 million of liquid funds they
had been holding as Euro-dollar deposits. There is no direct measure of
the latter amount but it is roughly consistent with estimates made by
the OFDI. For some companies the inflow may have been necessary to re-
duce outflows for the year to allowable amounts, but the greater part
probably had the effect of bringing some investors well below their 1968
ceilings, and is therefore potentially available for outflows this year.

IV -3
The liquidity surplus registered in 1968 was the first since
1957, and represents a net improvement of $4 billion over the 1967 de-
ficit of $3.6 billion. Since the merchandise trade deficit for the
year, as discussed below, probably did not exceed $1/2 billion, com-
pared to a $3-1/2 billion surplus in 1967, the net improvement in all
other above-the-line transactions would have had to be on the order of
$7 billion. Some of the elements of the improvement were the following:
a) Financing arrangements with foreign governments of the
type shown in the preceding table yielded about $1.7 billion more in
1968 than in 1967.
b) In the case of direct investments it seems quite possible
that the goal of reducing direct investments (including reinvested
earnings) by $1 billion from the 1967 amount was exceeded, perhaps by
$1/2 billion. Some of this appears as higher income receipts, but most
will be reflected in the accounts as a reduction in deposits built up
abroad out of the proceeds of foreign loans.
Another aim of the direct investment controls was to reduce
liquid assets held abroad (other than the proceeds of foreign borrow-
ings), to 1965-66 average levels by mid-June. This brought a net
inflow of over $200 million in 1968 whereas there had been an outflow
of about that size in 1967.
c) Banking claims on foreigners (including claims held for
the account of customers) probably did not increase as much in the
fourth quarter as they normally would for seasonal reasons, because

IV -4
of the shifts of loans to branches mentioned above. If so, there was
a net inflow of bank-reported claims of about $1/2 billion in 1968,
reversing a net outflow of $750 million in 1967 -- a net gain of $1-1/4
billion.
d) Foreign private investors brought in considerably more
capital for long-term investment in 1968 than in 1967. Portfolio in-
vestments in U.S. equity securities were about double the $800 million
registered in 1967, and inflows for direct investment were probably
larger by $100 million or more.
The transactions cited above -- some of which are largely
guesswork at this stage -- add up to a net improvement over 1967 of
over $5-1/2 billion. There are other transactions that resulted in
larger payments to foreigners in 1968 -- such as interest payments on
foreign holdings of U.S. obligations, which increased considerably as
holdings grew and interest rates rose -- so that the items for which
estimates are offered fall far short of accounting for the whole im-
provement in the liquidity balance last year.
Measured on the official settlements basis there was also
a sizable surplus in December, offsetting deficits in October and
November, so that there was a small surplus of perhaps $200 million
for the entire fourth quarter, seasonally adjusted. This surplus was
much less than that on the liquidity basis since it was not affected
by investments by foreign official agencies in nonliquid assets, or
by the transactions mentioned above that resulted in a large drop in
liabilities to foreign branches.

IV -5
For the year there was a major improvement in the official
settlements balance from a deficit of $3.4 billion in 1967 to a surplus
of about $1.6 billion. Liabilities to foreign official accounts dropped
by $3/4 billion in 1968 as against an increase of $3.4 billion in 1967.
Within those totals there was also a major shift out of liquid lia-
bilities to foreign official accounts and into various nonliquid types
of holdings.
U.S. official reserves gained $1.1 billion in the fourth
quarter and $880 million for the year, whereas there was practically
no change in 1967. The gold stock made modest gains after the loss
of $1.4 billion in the first quarter, as purchases from France exceeded
sales to other countries, so that the loss for the year of $1.2 billion
was about the same as in 1967. However, the IMF gold tranche position
was fully reconstituted by the end of the year, and holdings of con-
vertible currencies increased by $1.2 billion, slightly more than in
1967. In both years there were large increases in holdings of sterling,
and in 1968 a sizable increase in holdings of French francs.
Euro-dollar market. Euro-dollar interest rates, which had
been advancing throughout the fourth quarter, reached record levels in
the closing weeks of 1968 and continued to advance in the first week
of the new year, reaching new highs on January 8.
Some of the pre-year-end firming of rates can no doubt be
attributed to year-end window-dressing repatriations by European com-
mercial banks. However, the only central bank whose market intervention
in the last few weeks of December clearly reflected large scale

repatriations of private funds was the Swiss National Bank; that bank
purchased $750 million from the market, on a short-term swap basis, but
returned a nearly equal amount of funds to the Euro-dollar market for its
own account. Since year-end a reverse flow from Switzerland is evidenced
by weakening of the Swiss franc exchange rate.
Market operations by the German Federal Bank in the last two
weeks of December and first week of January resulted in substantial net
deliveries of dollars to the exchange market. The combined effect of
the Bundesbank's spot and swap operations (net of receipts on maturing
forward contracts to receive dollars) was to deliver about $400 million
to the exchange market in the last two weeks of December and an additional
$850 million in the first week of January. Some substantial part of these
funds may have gone to the Euro-dollar market.

IV -7
To explain Euro-dollar market conditions in recent weeks
one must probably look to money market developments in the United
States since mid-December and the consequent stepping up of bidding
for Euro-dollar funds by American bank branches.
Recent changes in the liabilities of U.S. banks to their
own foreign branches would seem on the surface to suggest that
despite active bidding the branches were losing deposits. Total
liabilities of American banks to their foreign branches declined
by nearly $1.4 billion in the three weeks ending December 31; the
largest decline (over $900 million) occurred in the last week of
the year. However, as noted earlier, the decline in liabilities
to branches in the last week of 1968 probably reflected in large
part sales of loans by head offices to their branches and shifts of
deposits by U.S. direct investors from foreign branches to head
offices. By January 6 the liabilities of New York banks to their
branches abroad had increased by over $300 million since the year
end.
Recent exchange market developments. Since mid-December
foreign exchange markets have been relatively calm. The price of
gold has risen to $42.45 an ounce, its second highest level since
gold markets were reopened following the crisis last March. The
advance in the gold price is generally attributed to comments in
the U.S. about the price of gold and renewed tensions in the
Middle East.

IV -8
The sterling exchange rate has held in a very narrow range
around $2.3845 since mid-December with only small and intermittant
net support from the Bank of England. The discount on forward
sterling -- which rose above 7 per cent per annum on three-month con-
tracts during the second week of December -- has since gradually
narrowed with minor support from the Bank of England,and the discount
on three-month sterling is currently 3.4 per cent per annum.
Funds continue to flow out of Bundesbank reserves as noted
above, and that bank has gradually raised its selling rate for
dollars to its current equivalent of 24.99 cents mark, slightly
below the mark par rate of 25.00 cents. The Swiss franc and guilder
exchange rates rose to their upper limits against the U.S. dollar
in late December as commercial banks in those countries repatriated
funds to meet year-end needs. Since year-end both these currencies
have weakened as the reverse flow of funds from the Netherlands
and Switzerland got under way.
The Bank of France continues its policy of operating in
the exchange market within rather narrow limits and there has been
little movement in the exchange rate. Apparently that bank made
large purchases of foreign currencies during December as a result
of changes in French exchange regulations, and repaid borrowings
from other central banks. The discount on three-month forward
francs in markets outside France continues at about 9 per cent
per annum.

IV -9
Demand for the Canadian dollar increased at mid-December
after announcement of the U.S.-Canadian agreement to a more flexible
arrangement regarding the ceiling on Canadian reserves. The Bank
of Canada also raised its bank rate by 1/2 percentage point to 6-1/2
per cent, following the Federal Reserve discount rate increase.
Recent demand on the part of Canadian banks for forward Canadian
dollars in connection with renewals of swap deposits by their
customers has eliminated the discount on forward Canadian dollars.
U.S. foreign trade. In November, the U.S. trade balance
was in surplus, following a deficit in October, as exports increased
more than imports. The erratic movement in the trade balance in
the past few months stemmed largely from the threats of dock strikes -
first in October and again in December. A strong export surplus
is expected to have occurred again in December as traders accelerated
cargo movements, particularly outbound, to beat the end of the
Taft-Hartley injunction on December 20. This may be followed, how-
ever, by deficits in the early months of the year if the strike,
now in effect, persists through January.
Even with a large export surplus in December, it appears
that the surplus in calendar 1968 will probably be about $1/2 billion,
on the balance of payments basis. This would be $3 billion less
than in either 1966 or 1967, and the smallest in the post World
War II period. For the five months July-November combined, the
export surplus was at an annual rate of $600 million (balance of
payments basis), compared with a less than $100 million rate in the
first half of the year.

IV -10
Only a relatively small portion of the deterioration in
the trade balance from 1967 to 1968 -- about 20 per cent -- can be
attributed to actual or threatened strikes in the copper and steel
industries, which boosted imports and limited exports of these
products. The major element in the worsening of our trade position
last year was the extraordinarily large increase in all types of
imports. In January-November 1968 monthly imports averaged nearly
25 per cent higher than in 1967. This compares with an annual
increase of 9 per cent from 1960 to 1967. The expansion in exports
last year, although not nearly as great as in imports, nevertheless
was also unusually large, about 10 per cent contrasted to the 6.5
per cent growth rate from 1960 to 1967.
Imports in 1968 rose much more rapidly than domestic
expenditures -- nearly 2-1/2 times as fast. In value terms the
ratio of imports to GNP in the first three quarters averaged 3.9
per cent, the highest on record. In 1966 and 1967 the ratio was
3.4 and the average from 1960 to 1965 was under 3 per cent. At
current levels of GNP the rise of .5 of a percentage point in this
ratio from 1967 to 1968 is equivalent to over $4 billion more of
imports than if the 1967 ratio had prevailed.
The rate of increase in imports was particularly high
from the latter half of 1967 to the first half of 1968, a rate of
36 per cent per year. The increase in imports to the next 5-months
period, July through November,was much slower -- less than 10 per

IV -11
cent per year. The greatest expansion was in automobiles, both
U.S. types from Canada and foreign types from Europe and Japan,
other consumer goods, and machinery and capital equipment. The
value of imports of cars from Canada and from other sources were
each about 60 per cent greater in 1968 than in 1967. Other consumer
goods rose by more than 25 per cent and capital equipment by 17
per cent. Purchases of foreign foods and industrial materials other
than steel and copper also increased but more moderately -- about
13 per cent.
The large advance in imports of foreign consumer goods
must be attributed partly to the attractive style and design of
foreign products and to the widening of the spread between foreign
and domestic prices. The unit value index (roughly representing
prices) for imports of finished manufactured goods is estimated to
have increased by less than 1 per cent from 1967 to the average
of the first 9 months of 1968, compared with a rise of about 3.5
per cent in domestic consumer prices of nonfood commodities.
Arrivals of cars, both from Canada and other sources, and
other nonfood consumer goods, continued to advance in the second
half of the year, but only at one-half to one-third the rate of
expansion in the first half of the year. The large inventory
buildup in European and Japanese cars has apparently eased.
Anticipation of lower prices after January 1, 1969, when the
second stage of the Kennedy Round of tariff reductions became

IV -12
effective may also have induced importers to postpone some purchases
of other foreign consumer goods until then.
Slackening in the rate of increase in imports in the
second half of 1968 was most marked in industrial materials. Aside
from copper and steel, purchases of other foreign metals, raw wool,
paper products, etc. rose at a rate of about 25 per cent between the
latter half of 1967 and the first half of 1968, and then showed no
further change in the July-November period. With domestic investment
outlays projected to increase and new orders for durable goods on
the rise, it may be expected that imports of metals and other industrial
goods may swing up again in early 1969.
Exports rose from the first half of 1968 to July-November
at a rate of 12.5 per cent per year, only slightly below the rate
of increase recorded for the preceding half-year. The entire gain
was in nonagricultural commodities; shipments of agricultural
products fell mainly because of a drop in P.L. 480 shipments of
wheat to India and Pakistan.
In contrast to the early part of the year when increased
deliveries of aircraft and of automobiles and parts (the latter
principally to Canada) accounted for the bulk of the nonagricultural
gain, the advance in the second half of 1968 was more broadly based
and included larger shipments of machinery, chemicals, and nonfood
consumer goods. By areas the export expansion also shifted in the
last half of 1968 -- from the less developed countries to Western

IV -13
Europe, particularly the EEC countries. Sales to Japan expanded
further but exports to Canada, aside from automotive deliveries,
remained sluggish.
With output in the industrial countries expected to
continue to expand and the rate of investment outlays in Germany
projected to rise sharply in 1969 as utilization there approaches
capacity, these markets for U.S. exports should be even more
buoyant in 1969.

IV -14
Economic activity in major industrial countries. Through the
first three quarters of 1968, industrial production in most of the OECD
countries continued to advance strongly above the relatively depressed
levels of the first half of 1967. By the July-September quarter output
had increased by 8 per cent over the corresponding period of 1967 for
the European OECD countries taken together. Some countries, notably
Japan and Germany, showed considerably larger increases. In early autumn,
however, German industrial production eased off a little from its peak
in August.

a/ Estimated implications of OECD's forecast for year 1969.
One striking aspect of 1968 developments was the stimulus pro-
vided in many countries by exports, resulting largely from the strong
demand in the United States and Britain. Total exports of the European
OECD countries increased in dollar value by 16 per cent from the third
quarter of 1967 to the third quarter of 1968. In Germany, and in France
prior to the strikes, rising export demand as well as expansionary
policy actions accelerated growth. In Italy, the strength of export
demand compensated in part for an unexpected weakening of domestic demand.
In Japan, the balance of payments improvement brought by corrective
monetary measures and by the export boom permitted an easing of monetary
policy. Even in Britain, the export sector provided the major stimulus
for expansion after the spring of 1968.
Looking ahead into 1969, the stance of economic and financial
policy in each country is a key factor to take into account. For the

IV -16
United Kingdom, it continues to be essential to reach a position which
the U.K. can make progress in repaying its massive foreign debts and
building up its foreign exchange reserves. In France, too, the balance
of payments position is now the dominant influence on policy, although
the need to avoid serious unemployment and domestic strife may make
itself strongly felt next year.
Germany and Italy, with large surpluses in their external
current account balances, are continuing to follow policies designed
to stimulate domestic demand.
A slowdown in growth of both GNP and international trade of
the industrial countries will probably begin to show up in half-yearly
figures for the first half of 1969, as the OECD's forecasts suggest.
Restrictive policy actions recently taken in the United States, Britain,
and France, will tend to hold down growth in trade in the first part
o. the year. On the other hand, imports by Germany, Italy, Canada,
and Japan, which rose rapidly last autumn after pausing earlier in
1968, may continue to increase fairly steadily. The OECD Secretariat
has forecast an increase in the total value of OECD trade of 7 per
cent from the second half of 1968 to the second half of 1969 -- compared
to an increase of 15 per cent a year earlier.
The trade balances of the U.K. and France should improve; those
of the other countries should deteriorate. GNP is expected to grow
much more slowly from the second half of 1968 to the second half of
196 than over the preceding two half years in France, and moderately
slower in most of the other industrial countries. Perhaps only in Italy
will GNP increase more than over the preceding period.

IV -17
Such forecasts as these assume gradual restoration of
confidence in the French franc and in sterling. New setbacks for those
currencies could induce further restrictionary policy actions which
would reinforce the expected slowdown in 1969. On the other hand, if
the international financial position improves rapidly some of the
restrictive measures taken in 1968 might be gradually eased in the
course of 1969.
Despite restrictive fiscal and credit policies, economic
activity in France in the first quarter of 1969 is likely to be higher
than in the last quarter of 1968. Exports, spurred by the border tax
adjustment and by subsidies still in effect this month, should expand
vigorously. Imports may decline, as the impact of higher border taxes
on imports will be reinforced by the stringent restrictions on obtain-
ing forward exchange cover. Retail sales reached record levels in
November and were probably even higher in December, in anticipation
of price increases after the yearend. There will now be a need to
replenish retail inventories.
French Government policy aims at a marked slowing of the
rise in activity before midyear. The impact of the price increases
in January resulting from delayed application of new value-added tax
rates domestically -- these could be as high as 2 per cent -- will
depress consumers' real takings. Once restocking is completed, new
orders should fall -- at least if fears of franc devaluation subside.
The outcome of wage negotiations in March will be significant.
It is not certain that the labor rank and file will follow their

IV -18
leadership, who are now giving the Government a qualified backing. The
French Government may be willing to accept a single one-step wage in-
crease of 4 per cent this year. Even if the wage rise is no greater
than that, prices are likely to increase in the course of 1969 by more
than the target rate of 4 per cent. To add to the difficulties ahead, if
output levels off as expected, unemployment almost certainly will rise.
Late in December, the German Government announced several
expansionary measures, including a significant increase in public ex-
penditures over previous plans, special investment bonuses in depressed
areas, and continuation of the easy monetary policy. Further measures
are under consideration. These measures should strengthen domestic
demand, and, in the longer run, help reduce the German economy's de-
pendence on exports.
The impact of the November reduction in export border rebates
was delayed as all foreign deliveries through December 23 were exempted.
This may have led to strongly enlarged German exports in December,
with an offsetting dip in January. However, all signs point to a re-
covery of exports in February and March.
German real GNP is likely to be at least 5-1/2 per cent
greater in 1969 than in 1968. Following the expansion at a rate of
8 per cent per year in the second half of 1968, some slowing should
appear in the first half of this year. With fuller utilization of
plant and labor resources, growth in activity may slow down to a 4 per
cent rate later in the year.

IV -19
Given the buoyancy of internal demand and the lowering of
import prices by the border tax adjustment, the value of imports in
the second half of 1969 may be about 13 per cent higher than a year
earlier. (Last year's second-to-half-to-second-half increase under
conditions of very rapid domestic expansion was over 20 per cent.) Since
the export rise should be of the order of magnitude of 5 per cent, the
trade surplus should be reduced somewhat.
The Italian authorities seek a more rapid advance in activity
after the disappointing developments this past year, when the rise in
real domestic demand between second halves of 1967 and 1968 fell to an
estimated 5 per cent. Even with the strong advance in exports, real
GDP increased less than 5-1/2 per cent. The Rumor Government and the
Bank of Italy consider that a real GDP expansion in 1969 of 6 or 7 per
cent is feasible without producing any pressure on prices; the govern-
ment is banking on substantial increases in both public and private in-
vestment.
There is, however, good reason -- as the OECD Secretariat
has suggested -- to doubt that the year-over-year increase in real
GDP will exceed 5-1/2 per cent. Difficulties lie largely on the side
of demand. The increase in exports is projected at only 10-1/2 per
cent from 1968 to 1969, compared with an estimated 14-1/2 per cent the
year before. Increases in Italian public investment typically en-
counter lengthy administrative delays. Similarly, the impact of measures
taken late in the summer of 1968 to stimulate private investment may be
slow in coming because of the presence of much unused capacity. On the

IV -20
other hand, expansion should be helped by a resumption of inventory
accumulation and by a decline in the saving ratio; real private con-
sumption may rise 5-1/2 per cent in 1969, compared to an estimated
4-1/4 per cent in 1968.
Italy ran an extraordinarily large current account balance
of payments surplus in 1968 -- an estimated $2.4 billion, or nearly
3-1/2 per cent of GDP. A significant reduction in that surplus in
1969 is unlikely. Consequently, the over-all surplus, which last year
was about $700 million, would shrink only if net outflows of nonbank
capital became even larger than the $1.7 billion recorded last year.
Although the expansion of imports should be much larger than the 5 per
cent rise in 1968, the forecast year-over-year increase of 13 per cent
will cut the trade surplus very little, given the projected export rise.
Gross product in the United Kingdom should expand more slowly
in 1969 than it did in 1968 -- about 3 per cent in real terms, compared
to the estimated 3-3/4 per cent in 1968.
The expected slowdown will result from policy measures
designed to cut back domestic demand for consumption so as to free
resources for the investment and export sectors, and measures to reduce
demand for imports in particular. The forecast assumes that the sub-
stantial productivity gain experienced in 1968 was largely cyclical
and cannot be sustained in 1969, and that capacity limitations are
beginning to be felt in some industries.
As a result of severely restrictive policies, consumer ex-
penditure may rise, in real terms, by only about 1 per cent from 1968

IV -21
to 1969, with the increase occurring mainly in the second half. If
the growth in money earnings cannot be adequately controlled, this
estimate could prove unrealistically low. Government expenditure is
expected to remain fairly stable. Fixed investment expenditures by
industry have been rising less than anticipated, but the Board of Trade
now sees an increase of 10-14 per cent for 1969 over 1968 in value terms.
Investment depends crucially on confidence in the Government and the
economy.
British exports have shown increased strength since the de-
valuation and in the six months from April-May to October-November
rose at a rate of 24 per cent per year. With the expected slowdown in
growth of world trade and perhaps increasing difficulties with export
delivery dates due to higher capacity utilization, U.K. exports are
projected (by OECD) to expand by 6-1/2 per cent from the latter half of
1968 to the second half of 1969.
Given the trend of imports, and the recent measures taken to
restrict them, the expected growth of exports should yield a trade
surplus after the middle of this year. Since the U.K. runs a large sur-
plus on services and transfers -- at an annual rate of over $700 million
in the first three quarters of 1968 -- a surplus on current and long-term
capital account should develop in early 1969, and may reach an annual
rate of about $600-$700 million in the second half of 1969. This would
fall short of the $1.2 billion target set at the time of the 1967 de-
valuation, but further gains would be hoped for thereafter.
Demand forces remained strong in Japan at the end of 1968,
and a November survey of business enterprises by the Bank of Japan

IV -22
forecasted a continued strong rise in industrial productioh in
coming months.
The Japan Economic Research Center, like most private
Japanese forecasters, expects a gain in real GNP for the fiscal year
beginning in April of 12 per cent, in contrast to the official esti-
mate of 10 per cent. From the latter half of 1968 to the second half
of 1965 the Center projects a rise of over 20 per cent in the value
of fixed investment outlays and a 16 per cent rise in value of mer-
chandise exports. These expectations may be overly bullish. If the
growth in world trade slows in 1969 as expected, the OECD Secretariat
looks for a Japanese export rise of only 8 per cent. Its forecast of
GNP is similar to the official Japanese estimate.
In Canada real GNP rose an estimated 5 per cent from the
latter half of 1967 to the second half of 1968. Domestic demand pro-
vided the major stimulus to economic activity in the second half,
whereas more rapid growth in the first half had been due to a strong
export performance. In 1969 the rate of growth should be about the
same as in 1968. The forecast 1969 price rise of 3-1/2 per cent --
also the same as in 1968 -- is slightly higher than the Government's
forecast of a few months ago, when it appeared that price rises were
abating somewhat. Indeed, inflationary pressures are now the major
concern of Canada's policymakers -- a concern evidenced in the
December increase in the Bank of Canada's discount rate.
The OECD forecasts that Canadian exports will increase from
second half to second half by 8 per cent, while imports will rise by

IV -23
7 per cent; the current account deficit for the calendar year (includ-
ing services) would correspondingly be about US$ 650 million, up
sharply from the estimated $230 million in 1968 though not much changed
from the rate in the latter half of last year. Even this level of
current account deficit may prove an underestimate, since with current
dollar GNP expanding at a rate of about 8 per cent, imports may in-
crease by as much as 10-12 per cent, as some private Canadian forecasts
suggest.

APPENDIX A: FINANCING RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION IN 1968*
Even though savings flows to nonbank thrift institutions drop-
ped by about a fourth in 1968 from their record 1967 level, residential
construction increased sharply. In no other postwar year has there been
such a contrast between the reduced volume of savings available to the
traditionally dominant residential mortgage lenders and the upward course
of housing activity. This Appendix provides some perspective about other
sources of financing last year, and assesses the implications for 1969
credit flows.
Activity in 1968
Net savings inflows to savings and loan associations and mutual
savings banks fell during 1968 nearly $4-1/2 billion below their record
1967 high --the second largest annual reduction of the past two decades.
Housing activity, on the other hand, rose considerably in both real and
financial terms. Housing starts rose by approximately 200,000 units, or
by a sixth; outlays for new residential construction expanded by more
than $5 billion, or a fifth. The number of transfers of existing homes
probably picked up a tenth or more, according to the National Association
of Real Estate Boards, in a period when average per-unit transaction
prices increased about 5 per cent.
Part of the strength in housing activity during early 1968
resulted from the lagged upward momentum of housing starts and transfers
that emerged in 1967 when savings flows to nonbank thrift institutions
reached a record high. Bolstered by a growing backlog of demand and
rising cost pressures, however, most of the strength in last year's
housing market undoubtedly can be attributed to such other factors as
the following, which were of varying but cumulative importance:
--increased flows of funds available to thrift institutions
from sources other than net savings inflows--chiefly from
net borrowing by S&L's from the Federal Home Loan Banks;
--more intensive use by thrift institutions of residential
mortgage funds to finance market transactions rather than
other purposes;
--greater borrower reliance on lenders other than the thrift
institutions--particularly commercial banks--for mortgage credit;

Section, Division of Research and Statistics.

A-2
--a marked further shift toward new multifamily projects with
lower per-unit capital requirements than single-family structures;
and
--greater borrower reliance on non-mortgage credit (and probably
cash) to finance new residential construction.
Additional information bearing on these points is discussed below.
Other sources of funds for thrift institutions. Through
November 1968, net savings inflows to insured savings and loan associ-
ations were down by more than $3.2 billion relative to the same 1967
period. Total sources of S&L funds, in contrast, were $350 million
larger in 1968, primarily reflecting a switch to a position of net borrow-
ing ($650 million) in the first 11 months of last year from a position of
net loan repayment ($2.7 billion) over the same months of 1967.
Aided by this net source of additional funds, loans closed by
insured S&L's through November 1968 were up by $1.7 billion, or a tenth,
over the same 1967 period. S&L holdings of all types of mortgages
expanded by $1.2 billion more in 1968 than in 1967. The backlog of S&L
commitments--primarily for residential mortgages--was more than a tenth
higher in November 1968 than a year earlier, partly reflecting expecta-
tions of improved savings inflow performance through next spring.
No comparable data are available for all mutual savings banks.
Greater propensity of thrift institutions to finance housing
transactions. Insured savings and loan associations directed a larger
share of their total new loans closed through November 1968 toward
financing housing transactions and relatively less toward other purposes
(such as financing nonresidential structures, land, and refinancing) than
they did in the same 1967 period. As a result, these associations advanced
approximately $1 billion more new funds toward housing construction and
purchase than they would otherwise have done if the 1967 loan-mix had
remained unchanged.
Comparable information for all mutual savings banks is not
available.
Greater reliance on lenders other than thrift institutions.
Commercial banks, FNMA-GNMA, and "individuals and others" provided
significantly greater support to the residential mortgage market in 1968
than they did in 1967. Altogether, net acquisitions of residential
mortgages by these three groups expanded by an estimated $2 billion more
last year than the year before. Net mortgage takings by the thrift
institutions, in contrast, probably increased only $500 million more
than in 1967, due to a cut-back by mutual savings banks which invested
heavily in the bond market. Net residential mortgage acquisitions by
life insurance companies--also substantial securities investors--declined
year-over-year by an estimated $300 million.

A -3
Stepped-up net lending on residential mortgages by commercial
banks--amounting year-over-year to perhaps more than $800 million--
accounted for the largest single sector of increased market support
in 1968. Expanded net mortgage takings by commercial banks exceeded
even the enlarged year-over-year $700 million increase in net acquisi-
tions by FNMA-GNMA. Increased net acquisitions by "individuals and
'others" partly reflected take-backs of junior mortgages in sales of
residential properties on which buyers assumed existing first mortgages
carrying rates well below prevailing costs of new credit.
Field reports of such junior mortgage financing and mortgage
loan assumptions were numerous last year, although the precise extent
of these activities cannot be measured. One indirect indication is pro-
vided by evidence of a continued reduced volume of prepayments on
mortgages on all types in 1968--a source of funds that tends to vary
inversely with loan assumptions. By the third quarter of last year,
life insurance companies reported that mortgage prepayments in full were
running as much as one-fourth below the same 1967 period.
Shift to multifamily projects. Dwellings in new apartments
accounted for around seven-tenths of the total year-over-year increase
in private housing starts during 1968. The further shift toward multi-
family construction helped to economize on the use of mortgage or other
credit per start. Based on construction contract data through November,
a new apartment unit required only three-fifths as much capital as an
average single-family unit. (Land costs per unit, too, averaged lower
for apartments than for 1-family homes.) During 1968, the change in
structure mix, in effect, reduced funds required for residential con-
struction contracts by about $725 million below the amount that would
have otherwise been needed had the 1967 pattern prevailed.
Of perhaps even greater importance, the construction and rental
of new multifamily dwellings is less dependent on the sale and financing
of existing homes than is typically the case for new 1-family housing.
In the latter case, used-home transactions may absorb as much as half
of all net new funds required. Compared with single-family starts,
therefore, new multifamily units may impose a smaller aggregate drain on
the mortgage market in particular and the capital market in general.
Greater reliance on non-mortgage financing. Last year's upsurge
in multifamily starts--as well as heightened expectations of inflation
and further growth of conglomerate corporations--all worked toward
increasing the reliance of residential construction on non-mortgage
markets as a source of financing in 1968.
A factor in the construction of apartment buildings is that
they afford both lenders and developers a broader range of debt and
equity financing options than single-family construction ordinarily pro-
vides. Included among such options--depending on legal constraints

A -4
which vary by type of lender--is the opportunity to negotiate mortgage
loans on rental structures which allow lenders to participate in property
earnings, either as additional interest or as a return to equity.
Mortgage loan participation features of these kinds became
fairly widespread in 1968 on income-producing properties of all types.
This was a year, of course, when availability rather than cost of mort-
gage credit was the limiting constraint on loan demand and when prospects
of accelerated inflation in rental-property values were heightened by
the lure of interim tax shelter (against the 1968 surtax as well) plus
longer-run capital gains.
A somewhat larger source of additional funds for both residential
and nonresidential construction in 1968 came from borrowing by real
estate firms in the securities market. During the first three quarters
of 1968, stock and bond financing by the real estate industry was up by
$151 million, or by more than two-fifths, above the same 1967 period.
Perhaps an even large source of funds came last year from joint
residential-development ventures involving industrial and other non-
building firms, including building suppliers. Boise Cascade, Gulf Oil,
and other partners, for example, announced plans to build a $320 million
resort-residential community near Las Vegas. Life insurance companies
also invested a net additional $7 million in residential real estate,
based on reports through October 1968.
Finally, more residential builders were absorbed during 1968
by industrial and other non-construction firms, thereby helping to
shore up the capital position and financing potential of a traditionally
capital-short industry. In perhaps the most dramatic merger, IT&T acquired
Levitt and Sons, formerly the nation's largest independent homebuilder
(about 5,000 dwellings in 1967).
Implications for 1969
Last year's developments in the financing of residential con-
struction point to at least three areas of significance for 1969.
1. The behavior of total sources of funds for nonbank thrift
institutions, particularly the strategic S&L's. If net savings inflows
to S&L's should decline further this year--a likely event if current
levels of market yields persist for long--these lenders could maintain
their total sources of investable funds close to 1968 levels only by
borrowing from the Federal Home Loan Bank System. Such borrowing might
have to be heavy if loan repayments (another important source of S&L
funds) should fall off in 1969 as a result of a higher structure of
mortgage rates. Whether S&L's might be willing to borrow possibly
several billion dollars from the FHLB System at a time of decelerating
savings inflows seems uncertain, at best.

A -5
At present, the Federal Home Loan Banks are prepared to meet
up to $1.6 billion in advances to member associations--at rates which
now run 5-3/4 to 6 per cent--without going to the market for net new
funds. But even if S&L's had available the same volume of investable funds
in 1969 as in 1968, they would have somewhat less leeway to make new
mortgage commitments this year since their outstanding commitments toward
the end of 1968 were much higher relative to S&L total cash flows than
they were a year earlier.
2. Commercial bank support. Crucial support for the residential
mortgage market last year came from net loan acquisitions by commercial
banks in record or near-record volume, which increased bank net takings
year-over-year by about a third. Whether commercial banks could acquire
construction and permanent residential mortgages in 1969 in even greater
volume than in 1968 will depend, of course, largely on the course of
their inflows of time and savings deposits--under the influence of
Regulation Q--and the strength of other loan demands. At present, the
prospect for a further substantial increase in bank support for the
residential mortgage market this year hardly seems bright; unless bank
opportunities to bid for CD's improve, a substantial decline in their
savings flows appears in prospect.
3. Support from FNMA and nonbank diversified lenders. FNMA
acquired a large volume of residential mortgages in 1968, and accumu-
lated a sizeable amount of new loan-purchase commitments for future take-
down in 1969 at the option of the sellers. If mortgage rates this year
should remain well above 1968 levels and if yields on home mortgages
should continue unfavorable relative to bond yields, FNMA new commitments
in 1969 might come under some restraint by reason of the necessity of
picking up and financing 1968 loan-purchase commitments made when the
rate structure was much lower.
Moreover, unless the depressed yield spread favoring home
mortgage investment improves substantially, market support from such
yield-conscious diversified investors as life insurance companies and
savings banks could dwindle even further this year, despite continuing
interest of these investors in multifamily (as contrasted with single-
family) mortgages carrying more flexible rates.
While prospects for housing finance thus seem more than usually
uncertain for 1969, underlying strengths clearly distinguish the current
market from conditions prevailing in late 1965 and 1966. Not only are
underlying shelter demands much stronger, but the mix of housing starts
has shifted further toward multifamily units which, albeit quite volatile,
offer broader investment incentives for lenders and developers alike
and require smaller capital outlays per unit than single-family dwellings.
Moreover, sources of equity funds for housing--always in short supply--
have broadened to the point where lenders, building materials suppliers,
and formerly non-real-estate investors as well as buyers have all become
a source of support, particularly in view of tax-shelter incentives and
expectations of further inflation. These differences--as well as the
raising of usury limits in some States,liberalization of lender invest-
ment powers, and temporary removal of statutory ceilings on FHA and VA
mortgage rates--have helped to ease some of the structural barriers
formerly restricting investment in residential mortgages.
