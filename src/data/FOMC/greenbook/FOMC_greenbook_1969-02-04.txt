SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK
Outlook for economic activity
The slowdown in growth of real GNP evident last quarter is
expected to continue during the first half of the year as an increasing
number of demand sectors show less ebullience. Inventory accumulation,
which rose substantially last quarter and helped sustain growth then,
is unlikely to rise further and may well decline. The recently released
budget figures suggest no further increase in Federal purchases of goods
and services for the remainder of the fiscal year. High interest rates
and reduced availability of funds should, after some lag, begin to reduce
the level of residential construction expenditures. And as a result of
higher tax payments, further increases in personal consumption expendi-
tures are expected to be moderate.
Weekly data suggest that retail sales in January may return
to about the November level from the particularly low rate indicated by
the advance estimate for December, but little increase, if any, is
expected in durable goods consumption. The recent downdrift in auto
sales appears to have continued in January (based upon data for the
first 20 days) and production schedules for February have been curtailed.
With growth of disposable income dampened, any large rise in consumption
in the first half would require an even larger cut in the savings rate
than has been projected.
Thus, the burden of expansion in the immediate future seems
to rest with sustained optimism of business, particularly as reflected

I- 2
in spending decisions for fixed investment. Although a new (confidential)
report on business plans for investment in plant and equipment does call
for a fairly substantial--10-1/2 per cent--rise in 1969 from the 1968
level of spending, the quarterly rate of increase, nevertheless, would
have to taper off sharply after the first quarter to meet the total now
planned for the year.
Over-all the growth rate in real output is now expected to
decline further, to under 2-1/2 per cent in the first quarter and to
about 1-1/2 per cent in the second quarter. With demand pressures
easing, the rise in the GNP deflator is expected to moderate to about
a 3-1/2 per cent rate by the second quarter, from about 4 per cent last
quarter.
Outlooks for prices and resource use
The rise of nearly 0.6 per cent in industrial prices from
mid-December to mid-January appears to have been the largest and most
pervasive of the past three years of generally growing inflationary
pressures. This step-up in the pace of the industrial price advance
was heralded by trade reports, which had revealed an extraordinary
bunching of price increases in early January, particularly for metals.
Large price increases for some industrial materials in recent months
and continuing strong upward wage pressures will provide continuing
pressure on prices of industrial commodities. However, since mid-January
there has been a fall-off in the number of announced increases, suggest-
ing that the pace of advance in industrial prices overall will subside,
particularly as demand pressures slacken.

I- 3
The rise in retail prices of consumer products moderated
appreciably at the end of 1968, while prices of services continued
upward at a fast pace. Housing costs--including mortgage interest,
which will now be boosted further by the recent action in raising FHA
and VA ceilings--are again bulking especially large in the rise in the
CPI, leading to a larger rise in the CPI than will be reflected in the
GNP deflator.
With auto assemblies down moderately and steel output
rising only seasonally in early January, the sharp step-up in industrial
production of late 1968 appears now to be shading off. Consumer goods
output has been exceeding the rate of final takings for some months and
efforts are now being made to reduce the rate of stock build-up in this
sector. Some of the sizable rate of total business inventory accumula-
tion in late 1968 probably reflected hedging against industrial price
increases that appeared imminent. The immediate outlook for business
equipment output, however, remains strong.
Insured unemployment continued at very low levels at the
turn of the year, suggesting that the total unemployment rate in mid-
January remained close to the November-December level of 3.3 per cent.
For the current quarter as a whole, labor demand--and the growth in
employment--is expected to moderate somewhat from the high late-1968
levels, owing in part to the expected leveling off of the rise in
industrial activity.

I-4
Prospects for supply of funds
Assuming yields on money market instruments are maintained
near current levels, time and savings deposits at commercial banks will
continue under considerable pressure. The rate of decrease of such
deposits may moderate some from the January level, which was augmented
by transfers out of consumer-type deposits. In past periods of dis-
intermediation at commercial banks, consumer-type deposit losses tended
to be concentrated in the first few weeks immediately following quarterly
interest crediting, with moderate net inflows over the remainder of the
quarter. CD's, however, are expected to continue to run off, at least
over the next several weeks.
CD attrition may fall back to a somewhat less rapid rate than
prevailed in January, but such a slackening would be associated mainly
with the somewhat lower volume of maturities estimated for February.
The heaviest run-offs are likely to occur at large money market banks,
with significant losses occurring at a number of the larger regional
banks as well.
Privately held demand deposits, and the money supply, are
likely to growth more slowly over the next few months. The reduced
rate of growth in disposable income would be expected to contribute to
such slackening and the firming of bank lending policies should lead
businesses to economize on holdings of cash and liquid assets. More-
over, the recently reduced volume of stock market transactions, if it
continues, should be a marginal factor leading to slower growth in
money.

I -5
At current levels of market yields, net savings inflows to
thrift institutions are expected to slow, relative to last year, and
the coming March-April reinvestment period is likely to be affected by
net withdrawals associated with April income and surtax payments. Data
thus far available this month suggest that the more interest-sensitive
institutions in New York and California have already begun to face much
slower net savings inflows. Under such circumstances, and with outstand-
ing mortgage commitments at very high levels, new mortgage commitment
activity is likely to be cut back in coming months. Nevertheless,
provided the reduction in net savings inflows is not excessively large,
thrift institutions are still likely to be able to accommodate existing
commitments, through increased borrowing from Home Loan Banks and
through further reductions in liquidity. Commercial banks, with their
fund inflows reduced, are also likely to cut back their mortgage activity
after a year in which they provided considerable market support. FNMA
mortgage acquisitions under existing commitments will probably take up
at least part of the slack, and the life insurance industry still appears
to have reasonable leeway between expected cash flows and projected
takedowns of commitments.
Outlook for credit demand
Credit demands in bond markets are expected to be on the
comparatively moderate side over the next several weeks. Nevertheless,
it is quite possible that interest rates in intermediate and longer-
term markets will rise over the near-term, as the pressure on banks

I- 6
and other financial institutions cumulates. Contrary to earlier market
anticipations, the Treasury is not likely to raise new cash in the
forthcoming Treasury refunding (to be announced January 29) because of
debt ceiling problems. But some upward interest rate adjustment on
coupon issues is still likely to develop in the process of distribution,
in view of the limited bank demand in prospect. Moreover, recent new
corporate and municipal issues have received a lukewarm reception
this has led to a rise in dealer inventories in these markets, with a
potential for a run-up of interest rates, particularly in the municipal
market.
In the corporate bond market, new issue volume is expected
to drop from the January level, when volume had been buoyed by unusually
large offerings of public utility issues. The February calendar of
utility offerings is relatively light, and there are no signs yet of a
build-up in straight industrial bond offerings. A number of borrowers
may be holding back in anticipation of lower interest rates in the
spring.
Municipal volume is also expected to drop off in February,
although offerings will remain at about $1 billion for the month. There
have been relatively large postponements of new issues during the past
several weeks since banks have virtually withdrawn from the market.
Demand for loans from banks is expected to remain fairly
strong over the next few weeks. Only a modest reduction in the advanced
rate of inventory accumulation by businesses is anticipated, and this
should help sustain business loan demands. In addition, expectations

I- 7
that bond yields may be declining in the spring may encourage interim
borrowing from banks.
Apart perhaps from consumer loans, other loan demands on
banks, too, are expected to show little abatement. Mortgage loan
activity should remain relatively high given the strong basic housing
demand, although banks may begin curtailing participation in that
market, as noted in the preceding section, given the limited rise in
total bank credit in prospect and continued strength in business loans.
And security loan demands may rise as dealers help underwrite the forth-
coming Treasury refunding.

I-8
Balance of payments outlook. Earlier expectations that the
balance on the liquidity basis would revert to deficit in January are
borne out by preliminary data. The repatriation of funds by direct
investor corporations in December to meet or surpass 1968 program
goals of course did not continue after the yearend. It is unlikely
that a reverse flow of any great size has been occurring; while the
companies have large leeway now for outflows to their foriegn
affiliates under the 1969 program, tight money conditions in this
country are doubtless inhibiting such movements.
The continuing longshoremens' strike is probably affecting
the payments balance adversely. The prospect is still for some im-
provement in the goods and services account after the port strike
ends. In the capital accounts, foreign purchases of U.S. stocks
are expected to continue large, but there is great uncertainty as
to just how large they may be this year; the dip shown in partial
December data, after record volume in October-November, can hardly
be taken as a portent for the future.
The over-all balance on the official settlements basis has
again been in surplus this month. The very sharp reversal since the
yearend of the flows of liquid funds through the Euro-dollar market
(from large outflow in December to very heavy inflow in early
January) owes a good deal to seasonal ease in the German money
market and the ebbing of speculation on DM revaluation, and further
inflows on the same large scale are not to be expected.

THE ECONOMIC PICTURE IN DETAIL
The Nonfinancial Scene
Gross national product. The economy appears to be showing
signs of decelerating growth. The official GNP figures indicate a
somewhat slower fourth quarter than we had been estimating earlier,
reflecting largely a dramatic slowdown in growth of consumption ex-
penditures. Although a step-up in inventory accumulation and business
fixed investment did help to sustain the increase in current dollar
GNP at close to the third quarter rate, the price deflator accelerated,
and the annual rate of real growth declined to a 3.8 per cent rate
from 5 per cent in the third quarter and from over 6 per cent in the
first half.
A continued move toward slower growth is anticipated in the
current and upcoming quarters. Inventory accumulation is unlikely to
provide further stimulus; indeed, it will probably slacken by spring.
Residential construction is already leveling off and business fixed
investment--currently a major source of growth in final demand--is
likely to rise less rapidly from now on. As a result, the increase in
GNP this quarter is expected to slow to an annual rate of $13.5 billion
from $16.8 billion in the final quarter of 1968, and to fall to $11
billion in the second quarter. The upward trend in prices should also
begin to ease somewhat with slackening demands; real growth in GNP is
expected to dip to less than 2-1/2 per cent in the current quarter and
to about 1-1/2 per cent by the second quarter.
Easing in consumer demand in the fourth quarter proved to be
greater and more widespread than anticipated, in part because of special

II -2
circumstances such as the flu epidemic. Although some increase in
consumer outlays from the fourth quarter level would seem likely in this
quarter, mainly in nondurable goods, demand for durables is expected to
continue moderate. Sales of new domestic autos have shown a steady
decline, after reaching a high of 9.1 million units (at annual rates)
in October. In December, sales were 8.5 million and sales in the first
20 days of January suggest that the downward trend has continued. Over-
all consumption expenditures are expected to continue to increase in the
first half of 1969 but at a much more moderate pace than during last
year on average.
The moderate growth of consumer demand projected for the first
half reflects in part a reduced growth in personal income and an even
sharper curtailment of gains in disposable income because of an increase
in social security taxes and larger than usual final settlements on income
taxes. Largely because of the tax bite, the projected rise in consump-
tion can only be attained by a decline in the saving rate from 6.9 per
cent in the fourth quarter to about 6.2 per cent in the first half.
Federal expenditures are expected to provide little stimulus
to overall economic growth in the first half of 1969. In fact, accord-
ing to the 1970 Budget, no further expansion is anticipated in Federal
purchases of goods and services in the remainder of the present fiscal
year from the fourth quarter level; we have adjusted our projections
down accordingly. Federal expenditures such as transfer payments and
grants to States, which add indirectly to growth in GNP, will continue

II- 3
to rise, but the overall increase will be less than in Federal receipts.
Consequently, the Federal Budget (NIA basis), which was about in balance
in the fourth quarter, should swing to a surplus of $6 billion annual
rate in the second quarter.
The rise in inventory investment which occurred in the past
three months, seems more likely to be reversed than repeated in the
current and upcoming quarters. Auto stocks probably continued to rise
in January although output was reduced slightly. With unfilled orders
rising, inventories of machinery and equipment also may rise. Never-
theless, the rate of inventory accumulation will depend mainly on how
rapidly production of consumer goods is adjusted to less ebullient
consumer markets. It is obviously impossible to predict when businessmen
will decide stocks are excessive and trim production. We have therefore
rather arbitrarily projected a continuation of inventory building in the
current quarter at a rate only a little below that of the fourth quarter.
But by the second quarter, the more moderate growth of final sales seems
likely to result in a significantly lower rate of accumulation.
In contrast to the apparently dampened enthusiasm of consumers,
businessmen continue to be optimistic. Our earlier estimates of business
fixed investment in the fourth quarter were revised upward by almost one
billion dollars in the official GNP estimates. The outlook for continued
expansion in plant and equipment has been strengthened by a strictly
confidential Commerce-SEC survey of business intentions to invest in
1969, taken in December. This survey, which is not to be published or
even publicly alluded to, indicates a year-to-year rise in plant and

II -4
equipment expenditures of about 10 per cent. But in conjunction with
the published November survey, these data suggest that the pace of the
investment surge may be slowing down. Most of the rise in investment--
except for manufacturers--is planned for the first half of the year.
The first quarter increase is expected to be somewhat smaller than in
the fourth quarter of 1968, with a further slackening indicated in the
second quarter. This pattern of moderating growth could be accentuated
somewhat if, as we expect, production levels begin to be adjusted to an
easing in demand, and profit margins begin to be squeezed.
Large existing commitments and very strong pent-up demand
for housing are expected to raise housing starts to over a 1.6 million
rate in the current quarter, despite the sharp--and presumably
temporary--drop in December. Residential construction outlays are
projected to rise by about half a billion dollars, somewhat less than
previously anticipated. With tightening financial markets, a reduced
current flow of loanable funds to nonbank thrift institutions and sharp
curtailment in deposit growth, a noticable trend toward a lower rate of
starts should emerge by the second quarter. The level of residential
construction expenditures may also drop back somewhat. This downturn,
coinciding with moderate growth in consumption, no increase in Federal
purchases, a tapering in the rate of capital expansion and a reduced
rate of inventory accumulation is expected to result in a rate of
overall growth in GNP of about $11 billion. This easing in demand
should reduce price pressures somewhat, and the GNP deflator is projected
to edge down to about a 3.4 per cent rate of increase from a 3.9 per cent

II -5
rate in the fourth quarter of last year. Although this is a much slower
deceleration than in the first half of 1967, when the drop in real growth
was sharper, the inventory swing was much larger at that time, inflation
had achieved less momentum, and had not affected long-term anticipations
to the same extent. Food prices were also dropping in early 1967.
NOTE: The outlook for the second half of calendar 1967 will be
distributed Friday with the Bluebook and supplement to the Greenbook
and will be discussed by the staff at the FOMC meeting.

Industrial production. Available output data for January are
insufficient as yet to provide a basis for estimating this month's pro-
duction index. Output of raw steel has increased about seasonally so
far--through January 25. Auto assemblies are running at a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of about 8.7 million units, down 2 per cent from
December. Production schedules for February, after allowing for a
20 per cent cut in Chrysler's original domestic output plans, are
tentatively set at an 8.6 million rate. Output of television sets was
low in the first 3 weeks of January suggesting either a further decline
for the month or a leveling off at the reduced December level. However,
the anticipated further rise in production of business equipment and
some materials--construction materials, chemicals, paper--should more
than offset the moderate declines mentioned above.
For 1968 as a whole, industrial production was 4.6 per cent
higher than in 1967 and a little above its long-term growth rate of
4 per cent. Rates of change in output during the year varied consider-
ably from quarter to quarter and among the major market groupings of the
total index, as shown in the table.

There have been two major developments in industrial
production in recent months. First, the sharp rise in output of
business equipment in the last quarter of 1968, which was shared by
most equipment industries. If business outlays for equipment equal the
anticipated expenditures reported by the Commerce-SEC survey, production
of business equipment in the early part of 1969 should continue to
increase, but probably at a less rapid rate than in the fourth quarter.
The second has been the continued growth in output of consumer
goods in the fourth quarter of 1968 in the face of a decline in retail
sales. While advance weekly data on retail sales for January suggest a
rise from the reduced December level, sales in current dollars have been
edging off from the August 1968 peak and retail prices have been rising.
Thus, the physical volume of consumer takings declined and inventories
increased over this period; beginning in November production of some
consumer goods, especially autos and other durable goods, is to be main-
tained or increased without excessive inventory accumulation, retail
sales must soon show a significant upward movement above the August 1968
high.
Capacity utilization. The December rate of manufacturing
capacity utilization rose to 84.4 per cent, from 84.0 per cent in
November. This was the third consecutive monthly increase. Little
further rise is expected in January.
Recent sharp increases in production of rubber and nonferrous
metal products have pushed operating rates in those industries to above

II -10
normal levels. Utilization rates are also high in the aircraft, auto,
petroleum and textile industries. Appreciable unused capacity remains
for the production of most other manufacturing products.

Unit auto sales and stocks. Sales of new domestic autos
increased in the second ten days of January from the first selling
period, but for the first 20 days were at a seasonally adjusted annual
rate of about 8.0 million units, down 5 per cent from the same period
in December and up 3 per cent from a year earlier. Stocks increased
10 per cent from December 31, 1968 to January 20, 1969, about the usual
seasonal rise. They then amounted to a 59-day supply and were at the
record level of the first quarter of 1967 when sales and output were
declining.
Retail sales. Figures for the first two full weeks in January
(Jan. 4-18) suggest the possibility that retail sales (seasonally adjusted)
are recovering this month from the decline now reported for December (the
December figures are still advance estimates).

II -11
In early January total sales of nondurable goods appear to
have recovered most of the December drop, despite little change indicated
for general merchandise. Sales of auto dealers (including service
departments), which had declined for three months, appeared to be a little
stronger, while furniture and appliance sales continued their earlier down-
trend.
Consumer credit. The rate of increase of instalment debt
leveled off in late 1968, after rising for six successive quarters. The
largest increase in 1968 occurred in October; in November growth fell
back to the monthly average of the third quarter, and early reports from
commercial banks indicate that December may have been somewhat lower
than that. Nevertheless, consumers continue to use instalment credit to
supplement other funds at a rate of about $10 billion per year, as may
be seen in the following table.

The December slackening in instalment credit growth appears
to have taken place mainly in auto credit, reflecting somewhat lower

II -12
auto sales. It is too early to ascertain whether a tightening of credit
terms contributed to this slackening because of the lag in the avail-
ability of these data. However, reports from sales finance companies in
November indicate some reduction in the proportion of new car loans of
over 30 months, and also some reduction in the proportion of loans
carrying very small down payments.
Leading indicators. The Census Bureau's composite index of
twelve leading indicators, which increased strongly in October, showed
a small decrease in November followed by a small increase in December
(preliminary) which brought it back to the October level. This series
had been rising with little interruption since early 1967. The move-
ments of the last two months are well within the usual range of irregu-
larities.

Component leading indicators increasing in December included
nonagricultural job placements, contracts and orders for plant and
equipment, industrial materials prices, stock prices, and the monthly

II -13
profit margin proxy (ratio of price to unit labor cost in manufacturing).
The manufacturing workweek, durable goods new orders, and private housing
permits declined. The changes were small, and all of the series except
stock prices were below their recent and historical high points.
The composite leading index is made up of twelve series chosen
and weighted according to the Census-NBER evaluation of their usefulness
in forecasting short-term movements in aggregate economic activity.
Components not yet available for December are net business formation,
corporate profits, change in book value of manufacturing and trade
inventories, and net change in consumer instalment debt.
New orders for durable goods. The value of new orders for
durable goods declined fractionally further in December, according to
the advance report, following a 3 per cent November drop. However, the
fourth quarter average was 7-1/2 per cent above the third quarter.

A major element in the new orders decline in December was a
further drop in fabricated metal products from a downward-revised November
level. Iron and steel orders also declined, after their strong recovery
in the preceding three months. Motor vehicles and parts were down sig-
nificantly from autumn highs, but other consumer durables orders
increased. The pick-up in plant and equipment spending was reflected
in an advance in machinery and equipment orders and may also be respon-
sible for the increase in the defense products industries, which include
the entire aircraft and communication equipment industries. The new,
more precise defense products orders series dropped sharply for the
second month.
Shipments of durable goods declined in December, particularly
for motor vehicles and nonferrous metals. Machinery shipments declined
somewhat. Unfilled orders increased in most durable goods manufacturing
industries.
Business plant and equipment. Businesses now plan expenditures
in 1969 for new plant and equipment about 10 per cent larger than last
year, according to a special Commerce-SEC survey of business plans taken
in December. (The results of this survey will not be published and are
confidential.) Manufacturers, as a group, are planning the largest
increase, nearly 15 per cent, with gains of more than a fifth by pro-
ducers of motor vehicles, other transportation equipment, textiles, and
paper. A relatively small rise in investment outlays is indicated for
the commercial and other group of businesses, and a decline by mining.

quarters of 1969, suggests that the rate of rise in total outlays will
slow substantially in the second half of the year. This slowing in
expansion results largely from a decline in outlays by nonmanufacturing
industries. It should be noted, however, that the two surveys may not
be fully comparable. The December annual survey is consistent with the
November quarterly survey with respect to their samples, but the later
survey may reflect modifications of plans reported in the earlier one.
In addition, the survey of annual plans may warrant a bias adjustment
as does the survey of quarterly plans.

the November quarterly
The December survey was the fourth taken at yearend to
ascertain businessmen's plans for the following year. Sufficient
experience does not yet exist with these annual surveys to suggest what
sort of adjustment may be appropriate for possible systematic bias
(understatement or overstatement of actual expenditures). However, the
three previous December annual surveys and the adjustment applicable to
the quarterly surveys suggest that the increase in investment this year
may be larger than was planned in December.
Residential construction and real estate. Seasonally adjusted
private housing starts, which had soared to an exceptionally high annual
rate of 1.72 million units (after a 2 per cent upward revision) in
November dropped 15 per cent in December to a rate of 1.45 million, the
lowest since last June. On a quarterly basis, however--to allow for the
marked irregularity in the monthly series--starts for the fourth quarter
as a whole were up moderately further from the advanced third quarter

II -17
rate to 1.58 million units, the highest since the first quarter of 1964.
For all of 1968, starts totaled 1.50 million, a sixth more than a year
earlier and the highest since 1964--when the total was 1.53 million--
with multifamily starts at a new annual high of 606 thousand.
While multifamily starts accounted for most of the fluctuation
through the fourth quarter, they also continued to account for most of
the rise, averaging a record 42 per cent of the total, compared with
40 per cent for all of 1968. Among the regions, the South, where the
marked fluctuation from October to December was concentrated, led the
quarter-to-quarter advance in total starts. But all other regions
shared in the increase in the final quarter except the Northeast where
a surge had occurred in the third quarter reflecting in part upward
adjustments in usury ceiling rates in a number of states.
Seasonally adjusted residential building permits held rela-
tively steady in December, and in the fourth quarter as a whole were up
more sharply that starts from the third quarter. December permits
dropped in all regions except the South, where they advanced a fifth
from an already high November rate and contributed importantly to the
over-all fourth quarter rise.

preliminary.
Based on the level of net inflows (including repayment flows)
which became available to major lenders during the second half of last
year, and allowing for the composition and strength of prevailing
shelter demands and other factors, housing starts in the first half of
this year could average as much as 1.58 million units or the same as
the annual rate in the fourth quarter of 1968. Moreover, with reported
mortgage commitments outstanding still generally rising and permits
relatively high, builders are likely to attempt to advance their
schedules in the wake of the further uncertainties caused by tightening
in mortgage and related markets and rising costs this winter. As a
result, starts could temporarily expand further, possibly beyond the
1.6 million unit rate in January and for the first quarter as a whole.m
I

II -19
Higher mortgage-interest costs and related problems may be
expected to become an increasingly important factor in real estate
markets as the year develops. However, last November--the latest month
for which data are available--seasonally adjusted sales of new homes by
speculative builders were holding somewhat above their improved year-
earlier rate. Moreover, stocks of such homes in all stages of construc-
tion, although up moderately since last summer, were still well below
pre-1966 levels. Sales of existing homes, which had apparently shown a
much greater year-to-year increase (14 per cent) than new home sales
through the first eleven months of 1968 were still over a tenth higher
than a year earlier in November, with the year-to-year price increase
holding in the 5-6 per cent range.
Personal income. Personal income figures for December
reflect continuing strong gains in wage and salary payments. A personal
income increase of $5.4 billion at annual rates in December was comprised
of $4.2 billion in wages and salaries and $1.2 billion from other sources.
In addition to the strong December advance, the November increase reported
earlier was revised up sharply, with the wage payments figure boosted to
$4 billion from a previously reported $2.5 billion. The estimated
changes in wage and salary payments for November and December now appear
to be more in line with the trends indicated by production, employment,
hours, and earnings data.

Even with the upward adjustment for November and the strong
December figure, the average monthly increase in personal income over
the fourth quarter was significantly below the third quarter rise,
mainly because of smaller increases in dividends and personal interest.
In addition, income flows to self-employed farmers stabilized over the
last several months of the year, after rising strongly between June and
September. Average increases in wages and salaries have not changed
appreciably over the past three quarters. The increases--averaging
$3.4 billion monthly over that period--are basically an outgrowth of the
rapid increases in wage and salary scales and to a lesser extent the
continued strong rise in employment.
Although the strong upward trend of personal income continues
as a stimulant to demand, both the surtax and an accelerated rate of
increase of consumer prices have contributed to a drastic reduction in
the rate of increase of real purchasing power. After rising at annual

II -21
rates of 6.7 and 4.3 per cent in the first and second quarters, the
rate of increase of real disposable income fell to less than 2 per cent
in both the third and fourth quarters. The last time the annual growth
rate of real disposable income fell below 2 per cent for two consecutive
quarters was during the 1960 recession--the growth rate averaged nearly
5 per cent per quarter between mid-1961 and mid-1968.

Labor market. Labor demands continued strong last month and
the labor market entered the new year in an exceptionally tight condi-
tion. Unemployment averaged only 3.3 per cent of the labor force in
November and December, and the market for adult male workers was tighter
than any other time since the end of World War II. Some easing in labor
resource use was suggested by a reduction in the factory workweek from
about 41 hours in the early fall to 40.7 hours in December and a drift-
ing up of claims filed for unemployment benefits in the past few months.
However, claims in mid-January were still well below the low year-ago
levels, the rate of insured unemployed as a proportion of covered workers

II -22
in December was as low as at any time since the end of World War II,
and the number of weeks claimed remained well below year-earlier levels
through the third week of January.
Nonfarm payroll employment adjusted for strike activity rose
by 233,000 in December, continuing the accelerated October and November
rates of increase. Renewed strength in manufacturing, where employment
had shown no growth from June through September, contributed to the
advance. The manufacturing increase from October through December
occurred largely in durables, specifically machinery and fabricated
metal products--reflecting strengthening demands for investment goods.
Although revised figures are not yet available, there are indications
that both the November and December employment figures for manufactur-
ing will be revised up.

Over the last several months of 1968, employment growth also
increased at a more rapid pace in the nonmanufacturing industries.
Construction employment continued to rise in response to high and rising
demand, and sizable gains occurred in trade, State and local government,

II -23
and finance and services. On the other hand, Federal employment has
declined about 100,000 since June in line with budget restraints enacted
last summer. In the prior six-month period Federal employment rose by
about 80,000.
Wage increases continued large in all industries in 1968.
Hourly earnings for private nonfarm workers reached $2.93 in December,
an increase of 7.3 per cent over the year. Large gains were evident in
union and nonunion, and in high and low-wage industries.

In manufacturing, the rapid wage pickup was in part the result
of a very active period of collective bargaining in 1968. New contracts
have emphasized large first-year wage increases and hourly earnings
continue to show unusually large gains. But because most major contract
negotiations in this important bargaining round are now completed,
pressure on wages from first-year wage increases (which have averaged
about 7-1/2 per cent) are likely to diminish, while second and third
year contract increases (which are expected to average a little over
4 per cent) will take on added weight.

II -24
Outside of manufacturing, continued tightness in the labor
market has increased competition for workers in all skill categories
forcing wage rates up, and the February 1968 increase in the minimum
wage put a much higher floor under the general wage level. The combined
effect of these forces has been most noticable in the lower-wage
industries such as retail trade, where hourly earnings between December
1967 and 1968 rose almost 8 per cent. Similar advances were recorded
in such low-wage manufacturing industries as apparel (8.7 per cent) and
lumber (7.9 per cent), while manufacturing as a whole rose by 6.5 per
cent. The wage bill cost of the 1969 minimum wage increase will be
much smaller than in 1968--an estimated $450 million, or about one-
fifth of the 1968 cost of about $2.3 billion--and with labor demand
expected to ease somewhat, advances in hourly earnings and wage rates
should slow down somewhat in 1969.
Industrial relations. Agreement on a three-year contract
covering 24,000 dock workers in New York has not yet established a
pattern for other Atlantic and Gulf Coast ports, and some 60,000 long-
shoremen continue on strike. Wage and fringe benefits in the New York
contract--which costs out at about 10 per cent annually--include a
first-year wage increase of 10-1/2 per cent, a guarantee of a full
year's work, increased pension and welfare benefits, 2 additional weeks
of vacation and an extra holiday. The effects on costs and on employ-
ment of mutual concessions on the handling of containerized freight
will not be evident for several years. Employers at other Atlantic

II -25
and Gulf Coast ports contend they are unable to meet the costs of the
New York contract which the unions consider the pattern settlement.
The union leadership is reportedly committed not to end the strike at
any one port until agreements have been reached at all ports. The
economic consequences of the prolonged strike have brought pressure
for Government intervention again in the negotiations.
Agreement has been reached on new two-year contracts at a
number of oil refineries and about half of the 60,000 oil workers on
strike since January 4 have returned to work. The strike has apparently
not affected production schedules significantly. The contract settle-
ments reached so far provide for estimated average annual increases in
wage and fringe benefits generally in line with the 6 to 6-1/2 per cent
negotiated in 1968. However, the first-year wage increase of 6 per cent
is much smaller than the 7.5 per cent increase provided in major con-
tracts negotiated last year.

II -26
Consumer prices. The consumer price index rose 0.2 per cent
further in December, to 123.7 per cent of the 1957-59 average. This
was 4.7 per cent above December 1967, and the average for the year
1968 was 4.2 per cent higher than 1967.
The December rise compares with increases of 0.4 per cent
in November and 0.6 per cent in October. The slowing over that period
reflected slackening in the rise in average prices of consumer products,
which was in part seasonal. Prices of new and used cars were down
seasonally in December and apparel showed only a small further in-
crease. On a seasonally adjusted basis, average prices of non-food
commodities rose less than 0.2 per cent in December, well below the
average rate of increase over the preceding 12 months. Food prices
rose somewhat more than seasonally in December, but the net increase
from October to December was small.
Average prices of services continued to rise at a fast
pace in December--by 0.5 per cent, the average monthly increase
over the entire year. Charges for household services, public
utilities, and medicare (particularly hospital fees) were up sub-
stantially further. Home purchase costs, which had jumped in
November, increased further in December, but mortgage interest
charges were about unchanged.
Wholesale prices. Wholesale prices of industrial commodities
increased 0.5 per cent in January, according to the BLS preliminary

II -27
estimate. In December, as in the preceding 2 months, the preliminary
estimate was revised up by 0.1 per cent and the December increase is
now recorded at 0.4 per cent. In view of the narrow rounding margin
and of the experience of upward revision in other recent months, the
January industrial price rise may well have been 0.6 per cent. The
diffusion of price increases, which had been declining in late 1968,
jumped sharply in January. After allowing for the usual downward
bias in the preliminary count, the number of industrial product
classes showing increases probably exceeded the 1967-68 peak of
131--or 58 per cent--reached in February 1968.
Prices of farm products and processed foods and feeds
showed a largely seasonal rise in January--1.3 per cent according
to the preliminary BLS estimate--and the total WPI rose 0.8 per cent,
to an estimated 110.7 per cent of the 1957-59 average.
Since the January pricing date, the 14th, the number of
industrial price increases appears to have slackened off, and part
of the zinc price rise effected in early January has been rescinded.
Moreover, prices of sulphur have been reduced, following a succession
of increases adding up to a reported total rise of over two-thirds
over the past four years.
Major factors in the large January rise in industrial prices
were: an abrupt 3 per cent jump in average prices of nonferrous
metals, following three months of moderate advance; a 1.2 per cent
increase in steel mill products, reversing the November decline; a

II -28
sharp pick-up in steel scrap; and a 4.3 per cent further rise in
average prices of lumber and plywood. In December, a 7 per cent
increase in lumber and plywood prices had accounted for nearly two-
thirds of the rise in the industrial commodity total.
Increases outside the lumber and metals areas were
relatively numerous, particularly in January, but in general they
were moderate. Thus, prices of machinery and equipment, which had
increased by 0.3 per cent a month between July and November, rose
only 0.1 per cent in December and an estimated 0.2 per cent in
January. Textile and apparel prices had also increased sharply in
late summer and in the autumn but then showed only a slight rise from
November to January.
Largely as a result of the extraordinary further advance in
lumber and plywood prices (20 per cent since July, as much as over
the preceding year and a half), but also because of the more recent
pick-up in nonferrous metals prices and steel scrap, the Federal
Reserve composite of "sensitive industrial materials" has played a
major role in the industrial price rise over the past 6 months, just
as it did in the rapid upswing from July 1967 to March 1968. In
that earlier period, nonferrous metals--primarily copper--accounted
for roughly half the rise in the sensitive index and about one-fifth
of the increase in the industrial total. From July 1968 to January
1969, lumber and plywood accounted for over two-thirds of the increase
in the sensitive index and for over one-fourth of the rise in the
over-all industrial average. The Table below shows, for selected

II -29
periods, the per cent changes (at annual rates) in sensitive material
prices and other components of the Federal Reserve industrial commodity
grouping.

Developments in the farm sector. Net earnings of farmers
from farming increased 5 per cent during 1968 from the relatively low
levels of 1967 but were 8 per cent below 1966 when a rare combina-
tion of short supplies of farm products and strong foreign and domestic
demands pushed prices to levels unprecedented since the Korean War.
Major factors raising net incomes last year were: strong consumer
demands enabling farmers to market more livestock products at prices
higher than the year before; high prices received for fresh fruits and
vegetables which were in short supply part of the year; price-support
loans that sustained prices of grains and oilseeds despite sharply
increased production; and increased direct Government payments.
Production expenses increased throughout 1968 and averaged
3.2 per cent above 1967. Prices of almost all production inputs were
higher in 1968 than the year before except feeds and fertilizer. Gross
farm income (seasonally adjusted) increased through the first three
quarters and dropped back in the fourth as volume of marketings of
livestock dipped below the very high levels of a year earlier. Never-
theless, farmers closed out the year with net earnings in the fourth
quarter estimated at $14.8 billion (seasonally adjusted annual rate),
6.4 per cent above a year earlier.
The mix of livestock marketings in 1968 gave full play to
the effects of strong consumer demands on farm prices. Strong consumer
preference for red meats, particularly beef, enabled farmers to market
larger volume of meat animals than the year before at higher prices.

II -31
For items somewhat lower on the preference scale, other factors
strengthened prices. Depressed prices for poultry, meat, and eggs
during 1967 were strengthened in 1968 by cutbacks in production during
much of the year. Milk prices were strengthened by higher price
supports.
Supplies of red meats and poultry are expected to exceed a
year earlier at least through the first half of 1969.
Crop production in 1968 broke the preceding year's record by
2 per cent as output of food grains and soybeans reached new highs and
feed grain output was the second highest on record. Large quantities
of these crops are moving under price-support loan. At the end of
December, commodities valued at $3.6 billion were under loan, a record
for December and an amount exceeded only in March 1959. With
seasonally heavy impoundings of cotton, feed grains, and soybeans
expected through March, it appears that price-support loan outstandings
are headed for a new high. Preliminary figures through January 15 show
loans already at a record $3.9 billion.
In view of this loan activity, the $3.8 billion official
estimate for fiscal 1969 net outlays for price support shown in the
1970 Budget may be low. Still, the Commodity Credit Corporation may
be able to hold net outlays to this level by selling a larger than
planned volume of certificates to private lenders (mainly banks). The
$3.8 billion Budget estimate assumed an increase from a year earlier
of $500 million in certificates outstanding at the end of fiscal 1969.

II -32
Since this increase was treated as a receipt, it lowered the estimated
outlay from $4.3 billion to $3.8 billion. Presumably, an even larger
build-up in certificates could be effected to offset burgeoning gross
outlays for price support. Much depends on money market conditions
and the willingness of the CCC to maintain competitive rates.
Rates to investors were boosted on January 14, 1969 from 6.0 to
6.625 per cent in order to attract investors. For a net increase in
certificates in fiscal 1969, the tempo of sales will have to quicken
during the rest of the year, because, at the end of December 1968,
certificates were a third, or $0.6 billion, below a year earlier.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL SITUATION
Bank credit. Total loans and investments at weekly reporting
banks showed an unusually sharp drop in the four weeks following the
December tax period, falling several times the amounts in comparable
periods of recent years. Reflecting in part the large run-off of CD's,
these large banks liquidated about $2.4 billion of security holdings--
principally Treasury bills--as total loans fell off only slightly more
than usual over this period. As measured by the daily average credit
proxy, adjusted to include Euro-dollar borrowing, member bank credit
is projected to show only a slight increase, on average, during
January.

Business loans rose more in the four weeks ending January 15
than in comparable periods of most recent years, in spite of extra-
ordinarily large repayments by retail trade and sizable repayments---
I

III- 2
of temporary tax period and year-end borrowing in several other industry
categories. The rise of business loans in the face of these heavy
repayments may be explained partly by a $225 million increase in loans
to the petroleum industry early in January, associated with the
financing of the Atlantic-Richfield merger. In addition, there are
indications that the recent strength in business loans may reflect
increased borrowing associated with expanding plant and equipment
programs. Recently, durable goods manufacturers, particularly producers
of primary metals, transportation equipment, and machinery, have been
borrowing more than usual amounts at banks, although as in past months,
public utilities, construction, and services industries also continue
to show strength.
Other bank loans, however, dropped much more over the four
weeks ending January 15 than in past years. Most of this decline was
in security loans, in response to large reductions in dealer
inventories. Outstanding consumer instalment and real estate loans,
on the other hand, continued to rise at a fairly rapid rate.
On balance, with total bank loans declining only slightly
more than usual and with large outflows of CD's, banks--particularly
in New York and Chicago--reduced substantially their holdings of
securities. Their $2.0 billion liquidation of U.S. Government securities--
which was confined principally to Treasury bills--was more concentrated
in the weeks prior to the large increases in Euro-dollar borrowings.

III -3
Their reductions in holdings of other securities, although mainly in
short-term municipals during late December, had encompassed longer-
term municipals as well as participation certificates and agency issues
by early January. However, bank holdings of liquid assets, as well
as liquid asset/deposit ratios, are still very high and are substantially
above those in late 1966.
Bank deposits. Total time and savings deposits at large'banks
declined contraseasonally in late December and in the first half of
January. Most of this reduction represented outflows of CD funds,
although consumer-type time and savings deposits also declined after
year-end.

By late December, yields on most money market instruments
were above Regulation Q ceilings on all CD maturities and banks began
experiencing large losses of these funds. Even though money market
rates dropped somewhat in early January, outstanding CD's at large
banks continued to decline, falling by over $1.7 billion in the four
weeks ending January 15. New York and Chicago banks lost another
$236 million in the following week, bringing the total decline in
CD's at these banks from the late November peak to almost $2.1 billion,
or a loss of about 22 per cent of total outstanding. This eight
week run-off at New York and Chicago banks--expressed as either a
percentage decline in total outstandings or as an average weekly
dollar volume of attrition--was slightly larger than that in the
first eight weeks of the late 1966 CD run-off, and was much larger
than the comparable period CD decline in the spring of 1968. At
these banks, January run-offs appear to be running close to 50 per
cent of scheduled maturities, and attrition at outside banks are
almost 20 per cent of maturing CD's. The run-offs have become in-
creasingly more widespread, with banks outside New York and Chicago
accounting for about 40 per cent of the decline in the first two
weeks of January as compared to 15 per cent of those in the latter
part of December.
Large banks moved to offset CD declines by increased borrowing
in the Euro-dollar market in spite of the high cost of these funds.
In the first three weeks of January, large banks increased their

III -5
liabilities to foreign branches by over $2.5 billion, more than
recovering the large year-end reduction in these liabilities and
bringing outstandings to almost $8.6 billion, some $1.3 billion
higher than the mid-December level.
Although inflows of consumer-type time and savings deposits
were fairly well sustained through the end of December interest-
crediting period, these deposits declined contraseasonally by more
than $250 million in the first two weeks in January, with banks in
New York and Chicago losing another $9 million in the week ending
January 22. The January decline reflected in part a much larger
than usual reduction in passbook savings deposits that more than
offset the moderate expansion in time certificates and open accounts.
The outflow of savings deposits, however, was concentrated in the
San Francisco district--where about one-third of all passbook savings
deposits at weekly reporting banks are held--with other banks, including
country banks, experiencing only slightly more than the usual post-
interest-crediting reductions. However, it appears that some of
the San Francisco decline in savings deposits went into time certi-
ficates and open accounts--probably in response to the recent expan-
sion in the types of these accounts offered--since only in this district
did banks show a more than normal increase in these accounts in the
first half of January.
The money stock rose sharply in early January, but dropped
back later in the month. The initial build-up in money balances

III -6
probably was partly in response to uncertainties concerning the
direction of future interest rate movements. The subsequent
decline in demand deposits developed as markets stabilized, and
as the public purchased the large amount of securities sold by
banks. U.S. Government deposits rose sharply, on balance, during
the first three weeks in January, following declines over the previous
three months.
Nonbank depositary intermediaries, Net savings withdrawals
during the recent reinvestment period, though somewhat larger than a
year earlier, apparently were considered "normal" by the institutions
in light of market yields and the enlarged stock of deposits. Net
reinvestment outflows were larger in the more interest-sensitive areas,
as California savings and loans accounted for all of the year-over-
year increase in net withdrawals from the associations. Also, savings
banks in New York were subject to increased withdrawals, while the
experience of savings banks elsewhere was reportedly quite similar
to last year. Moreover, New York City savings banks continued to
experience net withdrawals through January 22, in contrast to net
deposit inflows in past years. In light of this indication from the
savings banks, the January savings growth at thrift institutions could
well be below the fourth quarter rate.

relatively high ratio of outstanding mortgage commitments to cash

remained strong, as detailed in the following section.

Corporate and municipal bond markets. Since the beginning of
the year, yields on corporate and municipal bonds have fluctuated in a
narrow range near the high levels reached in late December. But new
issues, on the whole, have not experienced a good reception and dealer
inventories, consequently, have mounted since mid-month. Most recently,
dealers have continued to bid aggressively in the face of dissapointing
sales.

The relative stability of bond yields during the past few
weeks seemed to reflect a combination of psychological factors, rather
than any basically better balance of current security supply and investor
demand. The hope for progress at the Paris peace talks, the release of
the Budget message proposing continuance of the surtax, and the change
in Administration all seemed to buoy the spirits of dealers. Moreover,
market commentators and bond dealers for a time adopted the view that
the tight stance of monetary policy would not be maintained to the point
of substantial market deterioration. Although ultimate investors did
not fully share this optimistic outlook, dealers were apparently willing
to tolerate a buildup in their inventory positions, especially since the
forward calendar of issues did not appear to be building up substantially.
The volume of corporate security offerings expected in January
has not changed appreciably since the time of the last Greenbook. Public
corporate bond offerings are estimated at $1,025 million this month,
nearly 15 per cent above the 1968 average monthly volume. Issues of public
utilities account for an unusually large portion of the total--about
55 per cent--which appears to reflect both continued heavy capital outlays
and the advance scheduling of some offerings. Total corporate security
offerings in January, including private placements and stock issues,
are estimated at $1.8 billion, comparable to the average pace of last
year.

Flotations of corporate bonds in February are expected to
decline significantly. Public bond offerings now scheduled aggregate
$650 million and further additions to the calendar are likely to boost
the ultimate volume to $800 million, one-fifth below that of January.
As now constituted, the calendar contains relatively few public utility
issues and a large volume of convertible bond issues. Notably absent
from the scheduled offerings are any sizable issues by manufacturing
corporations.
The expected decline in February bond volume and the absence
of large industrial borrowers should not, as yet, be viewed as reflecting
a scaling down of investment plans and associated credit requirements.

III -11
Given the current high level of yields, corporate treasurers are unlikely
to rush to the bond markets if other sources of credit are available.
Internal sources of funds, including first quarter tax accruals and
drawing down of liquid assets, as well as use of credit lines at banks
should permit considerable near-term flexibility in bond market financing.
However, if these sources of funds threaten to dry up, credit demands
may well spill over into the corporate bond market,
In the municipal market, January offerings will aggregate an
estimated $1.2 billion, $200 million above earlier estimates. Late
additions to the calendar have more than offset nearly $200 million of
postponements this month. This relatively large volume of issues has
not been fully distributed, however, and dealer inventories have shown
a considerable advance throughout the month. Furthermore, upward rate
pressure seems to be building as commercial banks have already sharply
curtailed their acquisitions of municipal securities.

State and local government bond offerings in February are
estimated at $1.0 billion, well below the 1968 average monthly volume.
Although municipal financing requirements remain large, the developing
upward rate pressure in this market suggests an acceleration of post-
ponements which will likely hold down the ultimate volume especially in
the near-term. Moreover, it may be much more difficult for governmental
units to issue short-term notes as a substitute for long-term financing
than in 1966. To date, the bulk of bank portfolio adjustments in their
municipals has been in short-term issues and yields on these securities
have advanced more than 100 basis points over the last three months.
And, in addition, some governmental units reportedly are bumping against
statutory constraints on the volume of short-term notes they may issue.
Thus, it is possible that the postponements of long-term financing may
be more quickly translated into an impact on capital outlays than was
the case in 1966, when borrowers had considerably more flexibility to
issue short-term debt or draw down liquid assets./
Mortgage market. Through the dividend reinvestment period
and most of January, yields in the sensitive secondary market for FHA
and VA home mortgage continued to advance each week, as shown in the
table. By January 27, average yields on FNMA's 6-month forward pur-
chase commitments had risen 15 basis points above the previous high in
mid-1968, and were 70 basis points above the end-of-September low.

Yields shown are gross, before deduction of 50 basis point fee paid
by investors to servicers. The first auction date was May 6, 1968.
Even at these yield levels, private market investors--some of
whom had held back during the reinvestment period--apparently showed
little enthusiasm thereafter, according to FNMA field reports, partly
because of large discounts on FHA and VA mortgages carrying contract
rates of 6-3/4 per cent which were in effect until nearly the end of the
month. Reflecting these developments, the backlog of FNMA's own mortgage
purchase commitments, which had been slowly accumulating for some time
under its new auction system, reached $1.2 billion, a new high.
Representing commitments to buy about 82,000 Government-underwritten
mortgages secured by new or existing homes, the backlog was about double
the unadjusted total at mid-1968, when the auction system was just
getting underway, and promised a degree of market support for some

III -14
months ahead. Ten per cent of FNMA's commitment backlog--largely
involving mortgages for purchase from mortgage companies at the option
of the seller--was scheduled to expire before the end of April, and
70 per cent before the end of July.
During December, average contract interest rates on conven-
tional first mortgages in the primary home-mortgage market also continued
upward to a new postwar high, according to FHA estimates shown in the
table. In the private secondary market for Government-underwritten
mortgages, average yields rose to within 2 basis points of the peak
attained earlier this year. Perhaps even more important, discounts on
these 6-3/4 per cent mortgages increased to still more restrictive
levels exceeding 6 points.
In order to make FHA and VA loan rates more competitive and
to minimize large discounts, the contract interest rate on both types
of mortgages was raised by administrative action to 7-1/2 per cent,
effective January 24--the first upward revision since last May. The
rate increase was equivalent to about 6 discount points, in terms of
effective yield to investors as calculated in the table. Even at
7-1/2 per cent, the new contract rate was apparently several discount
points below market yields prevailing at the time. In a number of States
where restrictive usury limits do not exempt Government-underwritten
mortgages, FHA and VA loans will be obliged to bear a contract rate of
less than 7-1/2 per cent, at least until current laws or regulations
are changed.

Despite the further rise in December, however, returns on
conventional as well as Government-underwritten home mortgages remained
unattractive relative to yields on new issues of high-grade corporate
bonds. In addition, they probably continued well below yields on income-
property mortgages, which are less subject to usury ceiling restraints
and may include equity-type participations in property income that are
designed to supplement returns from high contract rates.
During December, demands for home mortgage credit apparently
slackened less than usual for a winter month, and funds remained
available in most major areas to accommodate these demands at the record
or near-record costs prevailing. By the end of the month, the backlog
of mortgage commitments at all savings and loan associations had built
up further for the sixth consecutive month to reach another new high,
after adjustment for seasonal variation and an upward revision in
November data. At $6.7 billion, the volume of outstanding S&L mortgage
commitments--chiefly for residential loans--was 12 per cent above
mid-year. It continued to represent about a 3-1/2 month volume of
mortgage takings, based on the seasonally adjusted rate of S&L loan
closings in December.
During the entire fourth quarter of 1968, the rate of
expansion in mortgage holdings of all lenders accelerated to a record
high, according to preliminary Federal Reserve estimates. The fourth-
quarter expansion, which followed little change at a moderately reduced
rate in the preceding quarter, was buoyed by exceptionally strong
support from commercial banks. Running at a seasonally adjusted annual

III -17
rate of over $29 billion, growth during the fourth quarter in all
types of outstanding mortgage debt slightly exceeded the previous
peak reached in early 1966 and again in late 1967. In a period
when housing starts climbed to the highest average rate in several years
and transactions in existing homes were at an advanced level, the
fourth quarter rate of expansion in outstanding residential mortgage
debt was especially marked,
Stock market. Having declined sharply in early January,
common stock prices advanced somewhat during the latter half of the
month, but remained significantly below their early December highs.
Greater gains were registered by the less seasoned issues on the
American Exchange. The recent modest recovery in prices has been
achieved despite the continuation of high interest rates, concern
about which had contributed to the sharp drop in prices early in the
month. Apparently, the break in the Vietnam negotiations deadlock, the
recent encouraging corporate earnings reports, and the growing feeling
that a credit crunch is not in prospect have outweighted the concern
exhibited earlier.

While shortened trading hours helped to reduce the average
daily trading volume in January, weekly volume was almost unchanged
from December when 4-day trading weeks were still in force. In
December, furthermore, volume was so heavy that "fails to deliver" for
New York Stock Exchange member firms rose 25 per cent to $4.1 billion.
This worsening of back-office difficulties led both the National Associa-
tion of Security Dealers and the New York Stock Exchange to propose
new regulations which would further motivate members to effect a reduc-
tion in the backlog of paperwork.

The increase in the December "fails" was largely responsible
for the $700 million increase in customer net debit balances during
the month. The margin debt of brokers' customers--a series which does
not include the cash account debt arising from such "fails"--is
estimated to have risen only slightly during the month. Bank purpose
loans to non-brokers, meanwhile, which include unregulated as well
as regulated purpose loans, rose $79 million to $2,710 million during
December.
Government securities market. Yields on U.S. Government
securities have declined on balance from the peak levels reached
following the January 7 boost in the prime rate to 7 per cent. Through
mid-January, declines ranged from 20 to 40 basis points on both bills
and coupon issues in 5 years or less. Most recently a part of the
declines have been reversed.

Early in the new year, there was a considerable relaxation of
the pressures on the Government securities market which had developed
in late December for seasonal reasons and which had been intensified
by fears of severe financial adjustments in response to continued CD
attrition. Good sales of bills, an improved outlook for the budget
and the economy, and the apparent ready availability of Euro-dollars
to ease the banks' adjustments to CD attrition, all worked to stimulate
a more relaxed atmosphere in the market in January. Also, weekly data
on the money supply and the monetary base were widely cited as evidence
that monetary policy had not tightened greatly, despite the run-off
of CD's, and further served to allay fears of a sharp curtailment in
credit.
As market psychology improved with the better demand for
Treasury securities--particularly bills--dealers inventories of Treasury
issues declined by more than $2 billion from late December to mid-January.
On balance, dealers have replenished their holdings somewhat since
mid-month, due partly to bank selling of the June tax bills auctioned on
January 14, as well as to acquisition of potential February "rights"
in anticipation of the imminent quarterly Treasury refinancing.

To some extent, the somewhat more comfortable money market
conditions prevailing in recent weeks relative to the seasonal tight-
ness in late December have also contributed to the improved underlying
market psychology. Dealer financing costs at major New York banks have
receded from their record year-end levels, making it easier for dealers
to carry their reduced inventories.
In light of the above developments, the market should be
in a generally good technical condition to underwrite the Treasury's
February refunding, the terms of which will be announced this week.
However, the most recent tendency for yields on Treasury securities
to back-up suggests that the market may be becoming more sensitive
to the continuing attrition of CD's.

Federal finance. Although the new Federal Budget forecasts
a $2.4 billion surplus for the current fiscal year, the Board staff
is nowprojecting a smaller surplus of $1.3 billion.1/ The difference
between the two estimates occurs on the spending side, with the staff
estimate of receipts the same as that in the Budget. Like the Budget
the staff is assuming that the surtax will be extended before corpora-
tions remit advance payments on calendar 1969 taxes in April. April
as well as June receipts would each have to be trimmed by about $250
million if the surtax extension were delayed, although these receipts
could, of course, be raised retroactively in fiscal 1970.
Even though the staff projection of Federal spending on a
national income accounts basis is the same as in the Budget, the staff
estimate on a cash basis exceeds the Budget projection by a little
over $1 billion, due to differences in loan transactions and in the
details of timing adjustments. A close look at the level of cash
spending thus far in fiscal 1969 suggests that the new Administration
may find it difficult to hold spending down to the $183.7 billion
Budget forecast. Outlays for transportation and agriculture, for
instance, are areas where budget forecasts may be too low. As the
Greenbook agricultural story indicates, CCC spending for price supports
may exceed budget estimates, and in view of tight bank credit conditions
there is some doubt whether the financing burden of this higher spending
level can be fully shifted to the banks by means of certificate
sales. If the staff estimate of overall spending should prove to be

Appendix B.

more accurate than the Budget forecast, the difference would probably
be spread fairly gradually over the final quarter of the fiscal year
and become evident principally in a somewhat smaller Treasury cash
balance during May and June.
Because the Federal debt subject to ceiling is expected to
approach the statutory limit in late February, as trust account holdings
of non-marketable special issues are increased, the new Treasury
administration has no immediate leeway for the further cash borrowing
that market participants had generally been expecting. As a result,
the Treasury is confronted with an exceedingly difficult problem of
cash management. Since the cash balance experiences a large seasonal
drain in the two weeks preceding receipt of March 15 income tax payments,
an inability to raise new money in February will put a very tight
squeeze on cash resources prior to that date. In the circumstances,
the Treasury could have to resort to special measures--such as sales
of assets or monetizing of "free" gold--in order to cover some of its
cash needs.
In the latter half of March, corporate income tax receipts will
replenish the Treasury balance somewhat, but in the first half of April,
the balance experiences another large seasonal cash drain prior to
receipt of April income tax payments. Repayment of maturing March
tax bills should provide the Treasury with additional leeway to finance
at least part of this further drain through additional cash borrowing.

U.S. balance of payments. The shape of the 1968 balance of
payments is now a little clearer than it was at the turn of the year,
though there are still sizable blank areas. There was indeed a surplus
for the year on the liquidity basis of about $130 million, a little less
than earlier indicators suggested. For December alone the surplus was
$1.8 billion (not seasonally adjusted) and for the entire fourth quarter
it was $.9 billion (seasonally adjusted). However, the trade balance
(discussed in detail below) was much worse in the fourth quarter than
expected because of a slump in exports in December. For the year the
trade balance (balance-of-payments basis) was only $100 million, far
less than any projection made during the year. Moreover, there was a
small net outflow of bank-reported claims in the fourth quarter despite
the year-end sell-offs of loans to branches. For the year the net
inflow of bank-reported claims was about $250 million, including claims
not subject to the VFCR which increased by at least $100 million during
the year. Also, foreign purchases of U.S. corporate stocks in December
were probably not much over $100 million, compared to over $200 million
per month in October and November.

IV -2
Since trade and bank lending showed a less favorable outcome
in the fourth quarter, more of the weight of explanation falls on the
transactions of direct investors and the unrecorded component. The
best guess at the moment for direct investments is that the net outflow
of U.S. funds in the fourth quarter (that is, the reported net outflow
for direct investment less the use of funds borrowed abroad) was insig-
nificant, compared to over $600 million in the third quarter. This kind
of result implies that the reduction of $1 billion from the 1967 outflow
(including reinvested earnings) required by the Commerce program was
greatly exceeded. The potential for outflows in 1969 under the program
which had been increased by some liberalization of allowables (about
$250 million) is further enlarged by a very large carry forward from
1968.
Even with this more favorable estimate of direct investment
flow in the fourth quarter, the liquidity surplus in that quarter can
not be fully accounted for, so that the residual item ("errors and
omissions") was quite possibly on the net receipt side for the second
consecutive quarter. If so, this residual may register a net receipt
in 1968 for the first time since 1959; over the 1960-67 period net
unrecorded payments averaged nearly $700 million per year.
Weekly indicators for the first three weeks of 1969 show a
sizable liquidity deficit of about $400 million, contrary to usual
seasonal expectations. Some of this reflected the sale of new foreign
securities in the U.S., and there may also be some adverse effects from

IV -3
the continued dock strike. However, there was very likely a reflow
abroad of some of the funds that were returned to the United States
at the year end. In the third week of January a moderate surplus was
registered.
On the official settlements basis there are only small devi-
ations from the estimates in the last Green Book; a surplus of about
$635 million in December (NSA), yielding a surplus of about $200 mil-
lion for the fourth quarter (seasonally adjusted) and $1.6 billion
for the year. Through January 22 this year this balance showed a
surplus of nearly $1.5 billion. The major factor in the difference
between the liquidity deficit and this surplus was an increase in
liabilities of U.S. banks to their foreign branches of $2.5 billion
in the three-week period, partly offset by a fall of about $0.5
billion in liabilities to foreign commercial banks other than
branches. With these additions, liabilities to foreign branches
more than recovered the end-of-year losses and reached a new peak
of $8.6 billion. Official accounts in the United States dropped
by $1.5 billion in the three week period, very largely reflecting
a decline in German central bank holdings of dollars in the United
States.
Merchandise trade. The trade balance swung back into a
deficit for the fifth month in 1968 -- as exports fell while imports
increased. The curtailment of cargo movements, particularly outbound,
after the dock workers' strike in East coast and Gulf ports began on

IV -4
December 20 apparently offset the acceleration in shipments in the first
part of December. Imports are affected less than exports since the value
of general cargo (requiring dock workers) through the strike-affected
ports is less for imports than for exports. Also, a considerable amount
of diversion of import shipments to West coast and Canadian ports has
been reported, and a heavy increase in imports by air. With the strike
continuing throughout January, another deficit this month seems likely.
The erratic trade movements during 1968 occasioned by potential
or actual strikes by U.S. longshoremen,and earlier by Canadian workers on
the St. Lawrence Seaway,have made it difficult to obtain a true reading
on the basic trends in our trade position. Adjusted for timing dis-
tortions, the export surplus is now believed to have been equally low
in both halves of 1968 -- about $100 million at an annual rate, balance
of payments basis, compared with $3-1/2 billion surpluses in 1966 and 1967.
However, with economic activity in Europe and Japan projected to continue
expanding this year, while the pace of growth in expenditures in the United
States is expected to slow down, conditions are favorable for a moderate
improvement in the trade balance this year.
Exports in calendar 1968 were $33.3 billion, balance of payments
basis, about 10 per cent higher than in 1967. Adjusted for timing dis-
tortions, exports advanced at a rate of 15 per cent per year from the
second half of 1967 to the first half of 1968, and then somewhat less
rapidly -- about 10 per cent per year -- to the second half of 1968.
These rates of growth were considerably greater than the 6.5 per cent
average from 1960 to 1967.

Particularly encouraging for the outlook for exports in
1969 was the commodity diversification of the expansion in ship-
ments in the second half of last year. Pacing the advance in that
period were greater sales of machinery, and also of consumer goods
and industrial materials. Deliveries of aircraft, a major element
in the export increase in the early months, leveled off at a high
rate, while shipments of automobiles and parts to Canada continued
to expand. The value of exports of agricultural commodities sagged
in the latter part of 1968 under pressure of improved world supplies
of grain and cotton.
The rise in exports to the Western European countries,
particularly to the EEC countries, was prominent in the export
growth in the second half of 1968. The strong expansion in total

IV -6
export orders for U.S. machinery (more than 20 per cent from the
end of 1967 to the end of 1968) reflects plans for increased invest-
ment expenditures abroad and also the approach of manufacturing
plant utilization to capacity levels in the EEC countries.
Imports in calendar 1968 were $33.2 billion, balance of
payments basis, nearly 25 per cent more than in the preceding year.
The rate of increase per year from the last half of 1967 to the
first half of 1968 was an incredibly high 36 per cent, swollen
especially by rising steel and copper imports. The rate of increase
slowed to about 10 per cent in the following period, adjusted for
timing distortions due to port strikes.
The ratio of imports to GNP in 1968 was at an all-time
high -- 3.9 per cent. The market penetration of foreign goods
was particularly significant for finished manufactures -- automo-
biles, capital equipment and consumer goods. Sales of European
and Japanese cars were at a record one million units, topping 10
per cent of total U.S. car sales for the first time since 1959.
The inflow of automobiles and parts from Canada was up by 60 per
cent from 1967 to 1968, shifting the balance of exports and imports
of cars and parts in trade with Canada from an export surplus --
$600 million in 1965 and $150 million in 1967 -- to a deficit of
about $250 million in 1968. (However, the official recorded value
of car imports from Canada probably overstates the payments value,
and the figures for exports to Canada do not cover all components
and materials used in auto manufacturing.)

Paced by expanded purchases of foreign radios and TV's
the ratio of durable consumer imports, other than automobiles,to
total consumer expenditures for these items was 7.2 per cent com-
pared with 6.3 per cent in 1967. (these ratios are based on foreign
port values of imports and retail values of total consumer spending
and are therefore understated.) A major factor factor stimulating
new advances in imports of apparel and footwear was the 6-1/2 per
cent use in U.S. consumer prices for such products from the end of
1967 to November 1968. The value of imports of nondurable consumer
goods was 2.1 per cent of domestic sales in 1968; in the year before
the ratio had been 1.8 per cent.
Purchases of foreign capital equipment, principally
machinery, also rose sharply in 1968, both absolutely and relative
to total U.S. sales of producers' equipment. The rise in the ratio
to total U.S. sales continued a long upward trend -- from 1.2 per
cent in 1953 to 3.1 per cent in 1963, 5.0 per cent in 1967, and
5.5 per cent in 1968.
The Euro-dollar market. Euro-dollar interest rates
reached historic peaks on January 10, with the three-month deposit
rate at 7.75 per cent per annum. At present, Euro-dollar rates are
about 7.40 per cent for maturities of one month and more.
The rise in the early part of January was counter to
the usual seasonal pattern, and reflected pressure from U.S. banks'
bidding for funds. In the first three statement weeks of this

IV -9
month U.S. banks increased their liabilities to foreign branches
by over $2.5 billion, more than reversing the decline of about
$1.4 billion during the last three weeks of December. The resulting
net increase of $1.1 billion in such liabilities since early
December, despite net repatriation of Euro-dollar deposits by U.S.
corporations, was facilieated by large outflows of German commercial
bank liquid funds. In early January the Bundesbank provided German
banks with a large volume of forward cover through swap transactions,
as noted below. In addition, there was probably a substantial
reflow of foreign (non-German) money out of DM holdings.

Foreign exchange market developments. Exchange market
activity has been relatively uneventful during the past three weeks.
The Bundesbank has continued to lose reserves but at a decreasing

IV -10
rate and greater strength in the demand for sterling has enabled
the Bank of England to make moderate purchases of dollars. The
price of gold in European markets rose to record levels during
the period. In London the fixing price rose to $42.75 an ounce, and
in Zurich the offer price rose to $43.00 an ounce at one time. On
January 29 the London price was about $42.50. Turnover in gold
markets reportedly has been relatively small.
The sterling exchange rate climbed to $2.3910 on January 22,
its first time above the $2.3900 level since early November.
Following this rise, however, demand moderated as apprehension
increased over a possible strike in the British steel industry.
Since mid-January the Bank of England has purchased about $200
million in the exchange market.
The discount on forward sterling has continued to narrow
and averaged about 2.7 per cent per annum on three-month contracts
during the week ending January 29, compared to a discount of 4 per
cent per annum at the beginning of this month.
Since January 20 the volume of both spot and swap market
activity by the German Federal Bank has been sharply reduced, rela-
tive to the volume of such transactions earlier in the month.
Between the first of the month and January 20 the Bundesbank
delivered $650 million to the exchange markets as a result of spot
sales and about $1,050 million on a swap basis; since that time
spot sales have totaled about $250 million while sales of dollars

IV -11
on a swap basis have amounted to only $50 million. Between the
year-end and January 29 the total of $2 billion delivered to the
exchange markets by the Bundesbank has been offset by over $500
million entering German reserves as forward contracts matured.
Except for the Italian lire and the French franc, major
continental currency exchange rates have generally weakened against
the dollar, perhaps reflecting a seasonal tendency for funds to
move back into dollar investments as well as the very strong pull
being exerted by the all-time high Euro-dollar rates. Several
European central banks have sold a modest volume of reserves. The
French franc, on the other hand, has remained relatively firm,
protected as it is by stringent exchange controls. The discount
on forward francs in markets outside France has narrowed signifi-
cantly since the first of the year; it is currently under 5 per
cent per annum on three month francs, compared with over 9 per
cent in early January.

IV -12
Price developments in major industrial countries. Price
advances abroad in 1968 were with few exceptions more moderate than in
the United States, where consumer prices rose nearly 5 per cent. Despite
active economic expansion, pressures of aggregate demand abroad generally
did not become excessive. Exogenous influences, such as devaluation,
changes in indirect taxation, and consequences of social disturbances,
raised domestic prices by as much as 5 or 6 per cent in some cases, but
these influences were not felt in the export prices of the countries
concerned.

Consumer prices rose somewhat more rapidly this past year
than in 1967 in some countries, including France, Britain, Canada,
Japan, and the Netherlands. In Germany, where the 1967 advance had
been only 1 per cent, consumer prices rose 2 per cent during 1968. In
several other countries consumer prices rose less in 1968 than the year
before. Acceleration of price increases, however, is expected to be
more prevalent this year.

Last year's wholesale price advances were generally greater than
in 1967. The outstanding exception was in Japan, where a brief slowing of
economic expansion occurred early in 1968.

IV -14
For most countries, price increases for food have been smaller
than for non-food items, thereby moderating somewhat the advance in
total consumer prices. While a decline in food prices contributed to
the relative price stability in Germany, the principal determinant of
over-all price movements in that country was the stability of unit labor
costs.
Although other factors besides prices -- such as buoyant U.S.
import demand -- contributed to good foreign trade performance of many
industrial countries during the past year, the maintenance of relatively
stable prices probably played an important role in improving competitive-
ness. In both Germany and Japan, export prices performed significantly
better than consumer and domestic wholesale prices, declining by 0.6
per cent in Germany and rising only by 0.4 per cent in Japan over the
year through November. Both of these countries recorded significant
export gains during the past year.
German prices in recent months have shown signs of advancing
somewhat more rapidly following very slight increases in 1967 and only
a moderate rise in the first half of 1968. The upward movement of prices
was restrained until recently by substantial margins of unemployment
and idle capacity.
A significant part of the German price rise in 1968 is attribu-
table to the shift from the turnover tax to the value-added tax (TVA).
The January 1, 1968 introduction of the TVA was accompanied by a rise
of over 1 per cent in consumer prices. From January through September
consumer prices remained virtually unchanged, but in October and November

IV -15
they advanced by 1 per cent. It is still too early to tell whether
this is the start of more rapid price increases in the months to
come.
Producer (wholesale) price movements followed a somewhat
similar pattern. In this case the rise associated with the shift to
the TVA in January 1968 was about 4 per cent, since the change from a
lower rate of gross turnover tax bore more heavily on the earlier stages of
the production and distribution process. There was another, but smaller,
general advance when the TVA rate increased from 10 to 11 per cent in
July.
German domestic price rises, however, were not reflected in
export prices. Following the introduction of the TVA, export prices
of manufactured goods declined by 1 per cent, and thereafter they re-
mained level through November. Under the TVA system exporters receive
a full rebate for domestic indirect taxes, whereas under the previous
gross turnover tax system they were undercompensated by an estimated
average of 0.6 per cent of their prices. The decline in export prices
no doubt contributed to an improvement of German competitiveness in
export markets. While world exports increased 9 or 10 per cent last
year, German exports increased nearly 12 per cent. However, the avail-
ability of industrial capacity and the ability to deliver export orders
promptly were equally, if not more, important in the realization of this
export gain. It remains to be seen what effect the recent changes in
border tax adjustments are going to have on Germany's export competitiveness.

IV -16
German price advances (apart from forward shifting of the
TVA) have been kept small by substantial productivity gains and a
decline in unit labor costs. In industry, output per man-hour rose
by 9 per cent from September-October 1967 to September-October 1968,
following a similar gain in the preceding twelve months. Hourly earn-
ings in industry increased less than 7 per cent. Consequently, unit
labor costs declined by approximately 3 per cent.
In 1968, Italy achieved another enviable record in holding
price increases to exceptionally small amounts, although this was
attained under conditions of a slower increase in aggregate demand than
in the preceding two years. In November, wholesale prices were 0.4 per
cent above the level of November 1967. The rise in consumer prices in
1968 through November was the smallest of the present decade; the in-
crease from November 1967 to November 1968 was only 0.6 per cent, a
marked slowing from the preceding year when prices advanced by 3.8 per
cent. The 1968 deceleration of price advances involved all major com-
ponents of the price index.
The favorable trend of wage costs contributed to the stable
price performance. Unit labor costs in manufacturing seem to have
declined. Output per employed worker in manufacturing during January-
September 1968 was 4.8 per cent greater than in the first three-quarters
of 1967, whereas minimum contractual wages of workers in manufacturing
increased only 3.5 per cent.
Italy's good price record helped to produce a notable increase
in the Italian share of world export markets in 1968. In the period from

IV -17
1961 to 1968 (January-September), Italy's share of world exports rose
from 3.56 to 4.78 per cent, or by an average of 0.18 percentage points
per year. But the gain from January-September 1967 to January-September
1968 amounted to 0.23 percentage points, the largest increase in the
1961-1968 period except for 1965. Average export unit values -- admittedly
an imperfect measure of export price competitiveness -- declined by 6
per cent from the third quarter of 1967 to the third quarter of 1968.
The most significant recent development affecting prices in
the United Kingdom was the devaluation of sterling in November 1967.
The direct and immediate effect was a fall of 14.3 per cent in the dollar
price of U.K. exports and a rise of 16.7 per cent in the sterling price
of U.K. imports.
Post-devaluation policy has been designed to reduce real con-
sumption in order to allow for and induce a shift of resources to in-
vestment and export production. A very stringent budget was announced
in March 1968, along with an incomes policy that placed a planned ceil-
ing of 3-1/2 per cent on wage increases. In conjunction with the rise
in retail prices -- reinforced by tax measures -- this was expected to
reduce real consumer income and expenditure.
Contrary to the avowed policy aims, retail prices did not rise
faster than earnings. Average earnings in October were 9.5 per cent
higher than the average level in 1967, while retail prices were up only
5.6 per cent, despite a 13 per cent rise in import prices in terms of
sterling over the same period. (Imports equal approximately 22 per cent
of GNP.) The relatively low rate of price increases is attributable in

IV -18
large part to fuller use of capacity and consequent sharp increases in
productivity. The high rate of productivity growth is not likely to be
sustained in 1969.
From November 1967 to November 1968, export unit values, in
sterling terms, rose 8.8 per cent. Since the increased costs to exporters
arising from the devaluation and other market factors were expected to be
5 to 6 per cent, it appears that exporters passed on to foreign buyers
much of the price advantages of the devaluation. The 8.8 per cent rise
in the sterling price of U.K. exports, taken together with the 14.3 per
cent devaluation, means that the dollar price of U.K. exports fell by
about 7 per cent in the year ending last November. In volume terms,
British exports have risen strongly since devaluation.
Consumer prices in France increased by 5.4 per cent in 1968
(year-over-year). They advanced by 1 per cent in January 1968 largely
as a result of the introduction of the TVA at the retail level. In
delayed reaction to the sizable wage increases negotiated during the
May-June unrest, prices started to climb sharply in September-October --
rising by 1.2 per cent over August. By November prices were 3.2 per cent
above the May levels. Wholesale prices declined in the early months of
last year as a result of the shift in the TVA from the wholesale to the
retail level and will still show a decline for 1968, although from May
to November they rose by 4 per cent.
Prices will increase sharply in January -- perhaps by as much
as 2 per cent, principally owing to the delayed application of increases
in TVA rates which went into effect on January 1, 1969. Prices have been

IV -19
subject to a complicated system of controls, which encompasses virtually
all sectors of the economy. Price developments in 1969 will depend on
what success the authorities have in applying price controls and resisting
union wage demands.
French export prices have increased at a slower pace than
domestic prices. Partly to offset the consequences of the wage increases
on the export sector, exporters have been helped by an export subsidy
scheme and a preferential rediscount rate on export paper, which currently
is 3 percentage points lower than the Bank of France basic discount rate.
The subsidies, currently amounting to about 1-1/4 per cent of the export
price, are scheduled to expire at the end of this month, but, with effect
from January 1st, exporters receive a larger export rebate to compensate
for the increased rates of TVA. In addition, the 4-1/4 per cent payroll
tax has been eliminated, and exporters are expected to reflect most of
this cost reduction in their prices.
Consumer price increases accelerated in the Netherlands during
1968. Part of the 4.1 per cent price advance over the year through
November can be ascribed to an increase in indirect taxes at the begin-
ning of 1968. By far the greatest part of price increases, however, is
the result of growing demand pressures. Economic activity has developed
with unexpected strength since the 1966-67 slowdown. Real GNP in 1968
increased by about 5.5 per cent in contrast to an increase of 3.5 per
cent projected a year ago. As a result of growing inflationary pressures
and their detrimental effect on the current account, Dutch officials have
recently announced a number of measures -- including an increase in the

IV -20
discount rate, restriction on installment credit, and an accelerated
phasing out of investment tax credits -- designed to bring the growth of
domestic demand into line with the economy's supply capacity.
The threat of inflation is generally regarded as the major
economic problem for Canada in 1969. Consumer prices advanced by 4.2
per cent in 1968, following rises of 3.5 and 3.7 per cent in 1967 and
1966, respectively. The rise in wholesale prices also accelerated during
1968, and in November they were 3.4 per cent higher than a year earlier.
Monetary and fiscal policies are currently moving in a relatively con-
tractionary direction, and the pace of price advances may slow toward
the latter half of the year.
Total exports have not been adversely affected by the accelera-
tion of price increases. Exports increased by 19 per cent in 1968, but
most of the increase was to the United States, whose rate of price advance
paralleled that of Canada and where such special factors as the U.S.-
Canadian Automotive Products Agreement and American labor problems aided
Canadian exports. Exports to the United States increased by 25 per cent,
while exports to other markets increased only by 7.5 per cent. With the
expected slowdown in the growth of U.S. import demand this year, Canadian
exports are likely to face greater competitive pressure. In these cir-
cumstances, the policy objective of slowing the rate of inflation has
assumed greater urgency.
Consumer prices in Japan have accelerated since the autumn of
1967, and the 1968 price rise was larger than a year earlier. The in-
crease in food prices contributed to the over-all price rise, but the

IV -21
continuation of an active expansion has placed increasing pressure on
resources, which is beginning to be reflected in price advances. Whole-
sale prices of manufactured products increased somewhat more moderately
this past year than a year earlier.
Export prices advanced less rapidly than domestic prices, and
this has contributed to a further improvement of Japan's competitive
position in international markets in 1968. Japanese exports accounted
for 3.6 per cent of world exports in 1961. By 1967 this proportion had
increased to 5.5 per cent and it rose further to 6.3 per cent in 1968.

APPENDIX A: RECENT MUNICIPAL BOND POSTPONEMENTS*
Among the more visible reactions to stringency in the credit
markets are the municipal bond postponements reported in the financial
press.1/ In all but a few instances, published postponements are directly
attributable to adverse capital market conditions reflecting high and
uncertain levels of interest rates.
As Table 1 illustrates, the level of reported postponements,
although fluctuating quarterly, has been relatively high over the past
three years. In 1968, the dollar volume of announced postponements was
somewhat lower than that in 1967, but the number of issues was greater.
Aggregation on a quarterly basis tends to blur the relationship between
postponements and fluctuations in bond yields. Nevertheless, a positive
association between these series is observable as both the dollar volume
and number of postponements tend to lunge ahead in those quarters when
rates advance sharply.
Those postponements reported in the financial press give only
a partial picture of the total shortfalls in State and local borrowing
emanating from financing market conditions. On the basis of the 1966
State and local borrowing survey, it is estimated that the dollar totals
of long-term borrowing abandonments, postponements, and reductions are
approximately twice those given in Table 1./
Thus in 1968 the overall shortfall in State and local government
long-term borrowing due to high and rising rates of interest could have
been $2.2 billion. Since some of these were of only a temporary nature
and others were complete abandonments, the net carry forward of unsatisfied
* Prepared by John E. Petersen, Economist, Capital Markets Section.
1/ Principal sources of this information are the Bond Buyer. Rand & Co.
"Sheets," Commercial and Financial Chronicle, and the Investment
Dealers Digest. Postponements can be either temporary delays or
complete abandonments but there is no way of telling this from the
information available. They may be voluntary on the part of communities
which reject bids or cancel an announced bidding; or involuntary, in
those cases where no bids are submitted. The latter situation occurs
when no underwriter can bid below a pre-set interest ceiling or when
bond prices are expected to drop rapidly and they fear capital losses.
2/ In 1966, the estimated total of long-term borrowing shortfalls due
to high and rising rates of interest was $2.2 billion as compared with
the $1.1 billion reported in the financial press. While the financial
press does not achieve 100 per cent coverage on municipal borrowings
(particularly on direct placements), most of the discrepancy is due
to decisions not to borrow having been made before formal advertising
of the issue for bids.

demand for long-term funds from that year would be less than the above
figure. Examination of data collected for 1966 and 1967 indicates that
approximately 60 and 50 per cent of the issues postponed in those years,
respectively, were brought back to market within a year after the initial
postponement. Complete information does not exist for 1968, but about
half of all postponements occurring in the first half of the year were
brought back to market by the end of September, especially in the third
quarter when municipal bond sales surged to a record-breaking $4.6 billion.
The significance of postponements is two-fold. First, to
cover shortfalls in planned long-term borrowing governments must turn
to liquid assets, short-term borrowing, or current revenues for con-
struction cash needs. While the heavy volume of long-term borrowing in
1967 and 1968 did replenish the available funds of some borrowers, the
steadily dropping growth of liquid assets in the face of rapidly accelerating
growth in expenditures no doubt means that many units are reaching relatively
tight liquidity positions. Moreover, if banks continue to liquidate
short-term municipals, bond anticipation borrowing will be exceedingly
expensive and, perhaps, not a viable alternative to long-term funding.3/
Symptomatic of the liquidity pressures developing in the general government
sector (net of retirement funds) is the rapidly increasing proportion
of borrowing that is going immediately into cash outlays instead of a
build-up of liquid assets for future spending. Thus, the string between
current borrowing and capital spending is being tightened. In 1965, the
net increase in general government assets was 60 per cent the net
increase in liabilities; by the first three quarters of 1968 the ratio
had dropped to about 35 per cent, with almost two-thirds of the increase
in liabilities flowing directly into cash expenditures, mainly for capital
outlays.
The second significant point concerning postponements is their
impact on State and local expenditures. It is conjectured that a
$2.2 billion shortfall in planned long-term borrowing might generate
reduced outlays (mostly for capital items) of $400 to $600 million over
1968 and 1969 combined. While the lower limit is indicated by the over-
all results of the 1966 survey, a higher estimate for effects arising
from 1968 difficulties is appropriate for two reasons. First, three years
of tightness has probably reduced the flexibility of many units in finding
alternative sources of funds (as was pointed out above). Second, there
are compositional differences in the 1966 and 1968 postponement experiences.
As Table 2 shows, smaller issues are becoming relatively more important
both in the number and amount of postponements. The average size of
reported postponements in 1968 was only half that of 1968 and two-thirds
that of 1967. It is safe to assume that to some degree this indicates
that a relatively greater share of borrowing delays are being borne by
3/ Yields on one-year prime municipal rates rose from 3.20 per cent
in mid-November 1968, to 4.25 per cent in mid-January 1969.

A-4
smaller governmental units. And since smaller governments have dis-
played less ability to insulate spending cutbacks from borrowing
disappointments, the ratio of spending cutbacks to borrowing setbacks
most likely has increased.
The mounting trend in the number of reported postponements
since 1966, combined with the smaller size of the average postponement,
strongly indicates that continued high municipal bond rates and resulting
borrowing delays will lead to cumulatively higher levels of expenditure
reductions.

APPENDIX B: HIGHLIGHTS OF NEW FEDERAL BUDGET
The new budget projects surpluses of $2.4 billion and $3.4
billion in the current and succeeding fiscal years. Thus, after a
$27-1/2 billion swing from deficit to surplus between fiscal 1968
and fiscal 1969, the Federal budget is now entering a more stable
period in which receipts and outlays will both be growing an estimated
$12 billion during fiscal 1970.
When these annual budget totals are broken down by quarters,
however, the pattern of expected fiscal performance looks much less
stable. For example, the swing from deficit to surplus during the cur-
rent fiscal year has not yet been completed. The Federal sector in the
national income accounts moved close to balance in the fourth quarter
of 1968, and is expected to show a surplus of $5 to $7 billion at an
annual rate in the first two quarters of 1969. Thereafter, the budget
assumptions (which show higher corporate profits than present Board staff
estimates) suggest that the NIA surplus will decline to around $3 billion
and hold at that point throughout fiscal year 1970.
Looking at the movement from deficit to surplus on a seasonally
unadjusted basis, it appears that during the half-year ending December
1968 only 45 per cent of the receipts projected for the whole fiscal year
were collected; outlays through December, on the other hand, amounted to
an estimated 51 per cent of the expected total. To realize the fiscal
year estimate of a $2.4 billion surplus, Federal spending will have to
be cut back further from recent levels. While this outcome is certainly
possible, it would not be surprising if actual spending proved to be
somewhat higher than projected. In any event, however, the Federal
Government after being a sizable net borrower in the July-December period
of 1968, will become a very large net repayer of debt over the remainder
of the fiscal year. Thus the influence of fiscal policy in the immediate
period ahead is restrictive on private incomes and stimulative in regard
to declines in Treasury bill rates.
The annual unified and NIA budget totals are summarized in
Table 1. Comparison of these estimates indicates that while NIA
expenditures are expected to increase by almost $15 billion during the
current fiscal year, unified budget expenditures (excluding net lending)
rise by only $9-1/2 billion. The difference largely reflects an expected
$4 billion shift in the timing of defense goods deliveries as compared
to the timing of defense checks issued.

Section.

B -2
Receipts. Federal receipts, shown in Table 2, are estimated
to increase by a mammoth $32.4 billion in fiscal year 1969 but to increase
by only $12.6 billion in fiscal year 1970. Less than half--or some $13.9
billion--of the increase for fiscal 1969 is derived from the revenue
effect of economic growth with a large part of the remainder reflecting
the surcharge. In fiscal 1970 the contribution of economic growth drops
to $11.3 billion, as calendar year 1969 personal income and corporate
profits are assumed to rise at a more moderate pace.
During the current fiscal year the increase in taxes derived
from economic growth considerably exceeds the increase in projected
outlays and in fiscal 1970 it is nearly as large as the increase in
outlays. However, additional taxes were imposed for fiscal year 1969
in order to offset the imbalance between receipts and expenditures that
existed in fiscal year 1968. If those additional taxes are not extended
in fiscal year 1970, the revenue outlook would change considerably. If
the surtax is not extended after June 1969 and if excise taxes were
allowed to drop as presently scheduled in January 1, 1970, there would
be a revenue loss of $9.5 billion in fiscal year 1970. While there will
be some revenue losses in fiscal 1970 in any event because the extra
retroactive surtax payments that occurred in fiscal year 1969 will not
be available again, these losses will be partially offset by gains result-
ing from a full year of collections under the increased employment tax
rate of 9.6 per cent, which became effective on January 1, 1969. Thus,
in the absence of any Congressional legislation (and given the budget
income assumptions), revenues in fiscal year 1970 would show a net
increase of only $1.0 billion--the growth effect of $11.3 billion, less
the $9.5 resulting from expiration of surtaxes and excise taxes, and
less another $0.8 billion resulting from the timing effects of tax rate
changes.
In addition to his recommendation that present income and
excise tax rates be maintained for another year, President Johnson recom-
mends two new tax rate increases for fiscal 1970:
(1) The employment tax rate is to increase from 9.6 per cent
to 10.4 per cent effective January 1970 instead of a year later as
provided for by existing legislation. This change would be made in
combination with an increase in the income ceiling on which the employ-
ment tax is collected, from $7,800 to $9,000, again effective in January
1970. This latter provision is not provided for at all under existing
legislation. The increase in social insurance taxes would serve to
finance a general increase in old-age benefit scales.
(2) Selective increases would be made in excise taxes connected
with air travel and diesel fuel for trucks. These are recommended as
user charges to offset Federal outlays benefiting those areas, and
would amount to $400 million.

B- 3
Spending. The spending side of the budget is summarized in
Table 3. The lending component of outlays is declining quite sharply
during the current fiscal year, partly because the FNMA, Banks for
cooperatives and Federal intermediate credit banks all have gone private.
Other declines in net lending during fiscal year 1969 are accounted for
by the Export-Import Bank and the Farmers Home Administration.
Defense spending is projected to rise by only $500 million
during the current fiscal year despite the need for a $3.0 billion
supplemental appropriation for Vietnam still to be legislated. A
good share of the expenditure cuts under the Revenue and Expenditure
Control Act are in the non-Vietnam defense area. For fiscal year 1970,
defense spending is again projected to increase by $500 million with
Vietnam spending tapering off by $3.5 billion and other defense spending
rising by almost $4.0 billion. Once the supplemental appropriation is
enacted, total obligational authority for all military outlays will be
the same during the current fiscal year as it was last year, but this
advance indicator of spending is scheduled to increase by $3.5 billion
in fiscal year 1970. None of these figures include the $2.8 billion Federal
pay raise in July, of which defense accounts for $2 billion.
The budget assumes that the war in Vietnam continues at the
present scale of combat and U. S. participation in fiscal year 1970.
Thus, it is the recent reduction in combat activity, and not a projection
of further reductions, that accounts for the $3.5 billion decline projected
in Vietnam related outlays. Unofficially, it is estimated that a complete
cease-fire with troops held in place would save an additional $5 to $6
billion a year. A reduction of military personnel to the level that
existed in June 1965 would allow the demobilization of 800,000 men and
would produce a further saving of about $8 billion.
Nondefense expenditures are shown in two groupings in Table 3.
The first group lists the categories that were exempted from the fiscal
year 1969 spending ceiling. The characteristics which earned them the
exempt status also makes it unlikely that the new Administration will be
able to cut these types of expenditures in fiscal year 1970, except perhaps
for the proposed increase in social security benefit scales.
Total spending in the exempted categories is estimated to rise
less in fiscal year 1970 than it will during the current year. The large
boost in social security benefits in March 1968, the big 1968 harvest
resulting in large CCC payments, unexpectedly rapid growth in outlays
for medicaid, and increases in interest payments all contributed to the
sizable increases in exempted outlays during the current fiscal year.
Some of these items are expected to grow less or even to decline in fiscal
year 1970. An increase in social security benefits, however, is recom-
mended for January 1970, which would cost $1.6 billion in fiscal year
1970 and $3.8 billion on a full year basis. Medicaid expenditures also
are projected to continue to rise rapidly.

B- 4
Nondefense expenditures that were subject to the spending
ceiling-in fiscal 1969 are projected to increase more rapidly during
fiscal year 1970. Here the new Administration will no doubt take a
hard look at the composition of outlays and at the possibility of sub-
stituting tax incentives for direct subsidies, but it seems doubtful
that the total Federal contribution will be cut by much. In President
Johnson's Budget, education, manpower programs and health services show
an increase of $1.6 billion. In manpower training most emphasis is on
expanding the JOBS and WIN programs. Under JOBS, private employers are
reimbursed for the added cost of hiring and training the disadvantaged.
Under WIN, state welfare agencies refer persons now receiving public
assistance to the employment service for counseling, remedial education,
job training and eventual placement. Also there is a considerable growth
in planned grants for vocational reliabilitation of disabled persons.
Community development and housing expenditures absorb only
a small fraction of the total budget in fiscal year 1969, but a $1.3
billion growth--which amounts to a doubling of expenditures other than
loans--is planned for fiscal year 1970. This increase is accompanied
by a reduction in direct Federal loans. Under the older programs the
Federal Government purchased mortgages, whereas the new programs
emphasize subsidies and leave the financing to private institutions.
Federal payments that reduce rents or mortgage costs are planned to
result in housing starts during fiscal 1970 of 500,000 units for low-
and moderate-income housing. While these starts can be either in the
form of new construction or rehabilitation, the 500,000 target level
is more than double the number of such starts expected during the current
fiscal year.
Outlays are also scheduled to increase sharply for the model
cities program, from $75 million in fiscal 1969 to $570 million in fiscal
year 1970. Moreover, new obligational authority requested for this
program amounts to $1.0 billion. Office of Economic Opportunity community
action programs which the new Administration may want to cut are budgeted
at $700 million. Of course, the eventual level of spending that will
actually be realized in many of these non-defense programs during fiscal
year 1970, is likely to depend heavily on developments in Vietnam.
Another way to appraise the spending outlook for the programs
not exempted from the spending cut is to compare the amount of the cut
in fiscal year 1969 with the amount of the rebound in spending now
projected for fiscal 1970. Table 4 provides a break-down for key non-
exempted programs showing (1) the actual level of spending in fiscal
year 1968, (2) the difference between the original budget estimates for
fiscal year 1969 and actual spending in fiscal year 1968, (3) the size
of the fiscal 1969 spending cut, and (4) the projected spending change
for fiscal 1970. Spending categories that will increase significantly
in fiscal 1970 after absorbing part of the spending cut in fiscal 1969
include outlays for non-Vietnam defense, the Farmer's Home Administration,

B- 5
highway grants, other commerce and transportation (partly airport
expenditures), community and housing, education, and all others (reflect-
ing largely the July 1969 Federal pay increase). There is also a
sizable increase in spending for health, welfare, and manpower, even
though this category of outlays was spared from the spending cut in
fiscal 1969.
Some of the fiscal 1969 spending cuts in net lending are
expected to be maintained in fiscal 1970, or at least not to show
increases. Again this is due in large measure to the transfer of
agencies like FNMA and the Farm Credit Administration into the private
sector. In the case of the Export-Import Bank and housing credit other
than FNMA, however, a lower level of loan outlays is projected to
continue. Finally, continued reductions are planned in international
expenditures, the space program and the Post Office deficit. In the
latter case, the projected saving reflects President Johnson's request
for an increase in postal rates.

BOARD OF GOVERNORS
OF THE
FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM
Office Correspondence
To Federal Open Market Committee Subject:
FrOm D. H. Brill, EconomistDate January 30, 1969.
The Greenbook distributed on January 29 contained a note
(page 11-5) that "The outlook for the second half of calendar 1967
will be distributed Friday ...." The staff wishes to inform the
Committee that this was a typographic error, and to assure the
Committee that the staff has not so lost confidence in its prophetic
powers as to limit its forecasting to the past. We will indeed be
projecting the balance of calendar 1969, with our usual confidence
and accuracy.
