SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK
Outlook for economic activity
Evidence is accumulating of a growing disparity between
business expectations and the limited expansion in final demands
apparently now underway. The impact of fiscal policy in curtailing
growth of disposable income was undoubtedly an important factor in
reducing growth of consumption, and thereby in overall GNP, in the last
quarter. Real growth, which dipped to a 3-1/2 per cent rate in the
fourth quarter, is expected to slow further during the first half of
this year.
Recent data suggest that the recovery in consumer expenditures
from the fourth quarters' reduced level will be modest--more so than we
had previously thought. Retail sales in early February appear to be
little changed from the January level, although unit sales of autos for
the first 20 days were somewhat above the reduced January rate of 8.2
million. We now anticipate that expenditures for durable consumer goods
as a whole will probably decline in the first quarter. Since the flow
of disposable income is being curtailed by higher social security taxes
and the beginning of clean-up payments on 1968 income tax liabilities,
it seems unlikely that there will be any substantial resurgence of
strength in consumer markets in the near future. Demands for housing
continue strong, however, and housing starts surged upward in January.
On the other hand, business still appears to be planning for
expansion. Manufacturers' new orders increased in January and the

I -2
backlog of unfilled orders continued to rise along a wide front.
Inventory accumulation was relatively heavy in December and inventory-
sales ratios rose further. Production of autos has already been cut
back, but auto dealers stocks are apparently still rising, and retailers'
inventories generally are quite high relative to sales. Stock building
may continue to be rapid in the first quarter, but accumulation seems
likely to slow substantially before midyear.
The current restrictive fiscal and monetary stance and the
persisting weakness in consumer demands would seem to presage a change
in business attitudes, and may be the basis for the recent stock market
decline. Under these conditions, it seems likely that residential con-
struction activity and capital investment expenditures should slacken
as the year progresses, leading to some general easing in the economic
environment.
Outlook for prices and resource use
Following the spurt between mid-December and mid-January,
the industrial price rise has slowed, though not as much as appeared
likely a month ago. Half the over-all industrial price rise since the
turn of the year has come from the largest advance in basic metal prices
in some years, and from continuation of the sharp increase in lumber and
plywood prices.
The metal price rise has been in response to generally strong
industrial demands; given the outlook for generally amply supplies and
for some easing of demands from the construction and consumer durable

I -3
goods industries and of business inventory demands, this price rise
appears to be tapering off. The demand-supply balance for lumber is
likely to improve this spring and at some point such an extraordinary
price run-up in a market characterized by volatile price movements is
subject to reversal.
Underlying these special situations, as well as the general
industrial price structure, has been the continuing upward pressure of
wage, transportation, and other costs. The rate of increase in wages
should begin to moderate. The Federal minimum wage increase on February 1
affected many fewer workers than the rise a year ago, and the deferred
wage increases effective under old contracts are generally smaller and
affect substantially more workers than the new increases negotiated, or
to be negotiated, this quarter.
The consumer price rise in January was about as large as the
average increase over the preceding year, if allowance is made for the
usual post-Christmas decline in prices of apparel, house furnishings,
and passenger cars. Decline over coming months in the recent over-
exuberant rate of rise in the CPI will depend primarily on a leveling
of food prices and further slackening in the rise for other commodities.
Industrial production continues to rise, with business equip-
ment and materials output gaining further. Some slowing in production
of consumer products, however, has kept the increase in the total index
since the turn of the year at a rate below the relatively rapid pace
of late 1968. The current production rise may be lagging the increase
in capacity--but not by a significant amount.

I -4
Insured unemployment remained low in early February and the
over-all jobless rate may remain close to the very low December-January
level of 3.3 per cent. Come spring, however, employment demands are
expected to ease somewhat and joblessness may rise slightly.
Credit demand ahead
Near-term demands on corporate and municipal bond markets,
while above the reduced February pace, are not expected to be unusually
large. In the corporate market, there are no signs of a buildup in the
calendar, and public utility offerings have again tended to predominate
scheduled offerings. With the market in a good technical position--
since the light February calendar and good sales of recent attractively
priced issues left the corporate underwriters with a low inventory position--
it is possible that yields on corporate issues may come under some down-
ward pressure over the next few weeks, although a further rise in the
prime loan rate of banks could reverse any such tendency.
Even though very recent light offerings and some price-cutting
have reduced dealer inventories of tax-exempt bonds, and despite the high
level of postponements of new issues which is reducing the volume of bonds
reaching the market, municipal bond yields are expected to continue under
upward pressure. Volume is expected to remain near $1 billion a month
in a market where the major buyers--commercial banks--have drastically
reduced their purchases. Indeed, there are reports that some large banks
are near the point of liquidating such securities. The U.S. Government

I-5
securities market is also beginning to feel the pressure of bank sales
of some longer-term Treasury issues.
At banks, loan demands are expected to be on the strong side
into early spring, although the firming in banks' lending policies
since late 1968 may be affecting some marginal borrowers. While a
slackening of business inventory accumulation is anticipated in coming
months--accompanied by reduced bank credit demands for such purposes--
corporate income tax payments in March and April are above year-ago
levels. The tax liabilities appear to be funded to a relatively lesser
extent in tax bills and CD's than in the past, and thus may entail
considerable temporary financing through bank loans. Demands for
mortgage loans at banks are expected to remain large, but consumer
loan demand is expected to slacken in line with the anticipated modera-
tion in consumer purchases of durable goods.
Outlook for supply of funds
The constraints that have been cumulating on the supply of
funds at banks and thrift institutions have led to higher interest rates
in bond and mortgage markets, cutbacks in offerings of municipal securities,
and will, with some lag, lead to a reduced rate of mortgage borrowing
even though housing demands remain strong. Banks have stiffened mortgage
lending terms, though this will influence their rate of mortgage lending
with some lag. And net savings inflows to thrift institutions are
expected to continue at near the recent reduced pace, assuming market
interest rates do not decline significantly. Savings inflows may even

I- 6
be further reduced in the March-April reinvestment period by withdrawals
to meet April tax payments.
Under the circumstances, with outstanding mortgage commitments
still at very high levels, new mortgage commitment activity should be
reduced in the months ahead and borrowings gradually taper off. Thrift
institutions are expected to be able to accommodate existing commitments
through further reductions in liquidity as well as increased borrowings
from Home Loan Banks. FNMA, for its part, is expected to continue its
increased support of the Government-underwritten mortgage market.
Some of the same factors influencing prospective net savings
flows to thrift institutions--high market interest rates and large
spring tax payments--are also acting to keep the net inflow of consumer-
type time and savings deposits at banks to a reduced rate. And there
is little prospect, given current market interest rates, that banks will
be able to roll over all maturing large certificates of deposit. The
pace of attrition may moderate some, however, both as amounts maturing
diminish and as the component of highly interest-sensitive funds
diminishes. In the next few weeks, resumption in growth of private
demand deposits is anticipated mainly as a result of declining U.S.
Treasury balances. Over-all, total deposits of the banking system are
not expected to show any significant expansion, and may well contract
further, with continued pressure thereby being exerted on the Euro-
dollar market and the Federal Reserve discount window.

I- 7
Balance of payments outlook
For the next month or two the outlook will remain unusually
obscure because of uncertainties about the trade position. The
interruption of normal flows by the port strike--which ended in New
York on February 15 and should be over soon in the other struck ports--
will make the trade statistics for January and February largely mean-
ingless. Moreover, interpretation of the large liquidity deficit
registered for the first seven weeks of 1969 is complicated by the
strike developments. There were heavy net payments in the week the
strike ended; it remains to be seen whether this was an initial effect,
associated with early clearances of imports through customs, that may
be followed by more favorable effects when dammed-up exports reach
their destinations and get paid for.
As the year progresses, some improvements in the trade position
is to be expected in consequence of the favorable cyclical conjuncture
here and abroad. But net private capital inflows, apart from the flows
of funds through banks abroad, are likely to be less favorable than in
1968. U.S. corporations will probably make use of the leeway they gained
last year under the direct investment controls and reduce their new
borrowings abroad. Maintenance of heavy foreign purchases of U.S.
equities cannot be counted on with assurance, if the stock market is
less buoyant than last year.
Staff projections of the 1969 payments balance to be covered
by liquid funds through banks and official reserve transactions are
in the range of $2-1/2 billion to $3-1/2 billion. In January the

I-8
deficit on this basis was about $1/2 billion. Since the increase in
short-term liabilities to U.S. bank branches and other banks abroad
was nearly $2 billion, there was an official settlements surplus of
about $1-1/2 billion in that month. For the rest of the year there
is little likelihood of much net additional inflow of funds through
banks abroad, and consequently a sizable official settlements deficit
probably lies ahead.

THE ECONOMIC PICTURE IN DETAIL
The Nonfinancial Scene
Gross national product. Recent data lend support to the
view that further easing in economic activity is likely in coming months.
Largely reflecting weaker consumer markets, real growth dipped to 3.4
per cent annual rate in the fourth quarter. (The preliminary official
estimate had indicated a 3.8 per cent rate of real growth in GNP.) This
quarter, consumer demand apparently continues slack, smaller gains are
likely in business investment and in residential construction, and
Federal purchases are expected to show only a slight rise. With inven-
tory investment continuing at about the relatively high year-end rate
and net exports reduced by the dock strike, the increase in current
dollar GNP is expected to decline from a rate of $16.4 billion last
quarter to $13.5 billion this quarter, and real growth is likely to fall
further to about a 2-1/2 per cent rate.
In the second quarter, final demand is likely to moderate in
all major sectors, and as spring develops, inventory investment should
drop to a much reduced rate. However, an estimated $5 billion will be
added to the rise in GNP as the termination of the long dock strike
results in a sharp jump in net exports. Despite this one-time stimulus,
both current dollar GNP and the rate of real growth are expected to slow
somewhat further next quarter.
The recovery of retail sales in January from the reduced
December level appears to have been smaller than was suggested by the

II -2
weekly data--a rise of about 2 per cent--and reports for early February
suggest no further gain or even a slight decline. Unit sales of autos
in early February apparently are running only a little above the January
rate of 8.2 million. Purchases of household durables have been trending
down for some months, and nondurables are showing less recovery than we
anticipated from their very poor performance last quarter.
In line with recent data, we have reduced our estimate of the
increase in consumer expenditures this quarter from around $9 billion
to $7 billion. Our estimate of unit automobile sales has been revised
down from a rate of 8.75 million to 8.25 million, and total durable goods
sales--about half of which are autos--are expected to decline after
leveling off in the fourth quarter. Overall, however, we still expect
consumption to rise somewhat faster this quarter than last. In the
spring quarter, with auto sales stabilizing, total consumption may rise
slightly faster.
Even these modest increases in consumer expenditures will
entail a substantial decline in the saving rate, probably from the
fourth quarter rate of 6.8 per cent to about 6.2 per cent in the spring.
Personal income is apparently rising less rapidly; the increase in
January was much less than the average increase in the fourth quarter
and although most of the slowing was attributable to strikes and to the
boost in payroll taxes, the gain in disposable income in the current
period will probably be even smaller than last summer when the surtax
was imposed. Moreover, with retroactive income tax payments continuing
to erode income gains, only a moderately faster rise in disposable income
is expected in the second quarter.

II -3
The over-all rise in business inventories in the fourth
quarter was relatively large, at a rate of $10.6 billion. Stock-sales
ratios rose generally, and were as high in December as at the end of
1966. However, in view of the rising volume of unfilled orders, some
build-up of manufacturers' stocks last quarter appears warranted.
On the other hand, retailers' stocks are probably top-heavy,
especially for durables. Inventory sales-ratios in December rose to
exceptionally high levels, and despite cuts in production, auto stocks
increased further in January and February.
Nevertheless, the momentum of business expansion and the
strength of inflationary expectations are such that it is likely that
inventory accumulation is still proceding at an undiminished rate, and
the rate of accumulation this quarter is expected to be about $10 billion.
If consumer demands show as little strength as now seems likely, a large
part of this build-up will be excessive. Accordingly, we are projecting
a drop in the rate of accumulation in the April-June quarter to $5.5
billion.
Outlays for residential construction this quarter will
probably be slightly higher than anticipated last month. The sharp
jump in housing starts in January to a rate of over 1.8 million from
the upward revised 1.6 million rate in the fourth quarter was to some
extent expected, and probably in part reflected builders' stepped-up
activity in anticipation of an increasing scarcity of mortgage funds,
and in part unusually mild weather in some areas. For the first quarter
as a whole, starts are now projected at a rate of 1.67 million units.

II -4
However, the current surge may represent some borrowing from later this
year, particularly the second quarter, and both new starts and residen-
tial construction volume will in all probability tend downward before
midyear.
A recent private survey indicated that business is planning
a rise of almost 14 per cent in fixed capital investment this year. It
still appears probable to us, however, that in view of the excess
capacity available and the increasingly restricted funds available for
construction, the 10 per cent indicated by the special and confidential
Commerce-SEC survey (see Greenbook for January 29, 1969) is likely to
turn out closer to actual. As incorporated in our projection, this
implies a sharply decreasing rate of increase over this year.
The longshoremen's strike at Atlantic and Gulf ports reduced
net exports to an abnormally low rate of $1 billion in the fourth quarter
and they are expected to remain at this level in the current period.
Merchandise exports have been hit more heavily than expected, with
uncertain effects on manufacturers' inventories, production and also on
domestic sales of imported items. The strike has now been largely
settled and a very sharp jump in exports is anticipated in the second
quarter.
There is little reason to change our view with respect to the
slow pace of economic expansion in the last half of this year, assuming
the continuation of the tax surcharge and present monetary policy. Com-
pletion of retroactive tax payments and the large Federal pay raise in
July will result in a somewhat faster rise in consumers' disposable

II -5
income in the third quarter than in the second. Nevertheless, consumer
spending is not likely to be much more ebullient especially if, as we
assume, the saving rate rises somewhat. Federal spending is not expected
to rise much in calendar 1969, residential construction activity will
continue to decline if mortgage credit remains tight, and a marked taper-
ing off in the increase in the volume of business fixed investment seems
probable. As a result, growth of GNP is expected to average only about
$12 billion a quarter in the second half--averaging about a 2 per cent
rate of real growth. In this economic atmosphere, price increases are
expected to moderate significantly, with the increase in the GNP deflator
decreasing from the 4.1 per cent rate of the fourth quarter of 1968 to a
rate of about 3 per cent by the end of this year.

Industrial production. Industrial production is tentatively
estimated to have increased further in February--probably somewhat more
than the rise in January but less than the 1 per cent rise in December.
Output gains in February are expected to be mainly in business equipment,
materials, and a partial recovery in defense equipment from the strike-
reduced January level. On the other hand, production of most of the
cyclical consumer products--autos, home goods, and apparel--is estimated
to have changed little or declined slightly.
Output of raw steel rose further in February. In the week
ending February 22, raw steel production (not adjusted for seasonal
variation) was 3 per cent below a year earlier, when steel inventories
were being built-up in anticipation of a strike, but was very sharply
above the post-contract settlement low at the end of September. Among
other materials, output of paperboard has continued strong in February
and runs of crude oil to refining stills have made the usual seasonal
increase, although 25,000 workers have been out on strike since
January 4. Output of industrial chemicals and most paper products has
apparently advanced further.
Production of business equipment rose to a new high in January
and is expected to have increased further in February. Output of trucks,
reflecting heavy demands, advanced again in February.
The immediate outlook for sales and output of most consumer
goods is not buoyant. Unit sales of new domestic autos declined 10 per
cent from mid-1968 to January 1969 and, over the same period, dealers'
inventories rose 15 per cent. Reflecting these disparate trends, auto

II -9
assemblies were reduced from an annual rate of 9.2 million units in
November to 8.7 million units in January. Production schedules for
February were originally set at a rate of 8.6 million units, but so far
output has averaged 8.4 million units, the same as the improved level
of sales in the first 20 days of February.
Demands for appliances, furniture, and apparel also have been
slipping since last August and by January retail sales of these products
were down 6 per cent even though prices continued to rise. Output of
household appliances which changed little between September and November
1968 rose in December and January to a new high. Production of tele-
vision sets declined 8 per cent from October to January and in early
February continued at this reduced level. Output of furniture and rugs
increased sharply in the fourth quarter of 1968 and extended the gain
into January, but the rate of increase was too fast to be sustainable.
If sales of these consumer durable goods continue to weaken, the rise
in output is likely to moderate considerably or perhaps turn into a
decline.
Capacity utilization. The January rate of manufacturing
capacity utilization is estimated at 84.4 per cent, little changed from
the 84.5 per cent of December. Since the middle of 1967 the operating
rate has remained within a very narrow range around this figure. The
February figure is expected to remain at about the January level.
Operating rates are above normal in the rubber and nonferrous
metals industries, and moderately high in the production of aircraft,

II -10
motor vehicles, petroleum, textile, and paper products. Appreciable
amounts of unused capacity remain for the production of most other
manufacturing products.

Retail sales. It is now apparent that retail sales have been
edging downward since late summer. Monthly sales, smoothed by a 2-month
moving average, show a persistent drop over this period. In real terms,
the downward course of sales is much sharper, with the level in December-
January off by 3.3 per cent from July-August.
Although retail sales in January recovered from the reduced
December level with a gain of 2.1 per cent, sales remain well below
August. If the automotive group is excluded--which in January rose in
contrast to a decline in the unit auto sales series--the increase in
January was limited to 1.7 per cent. So far the weekly sales figures
for February suggest that this month will be no higher than January.

Most of the strength in January was in sales of the automotive
group and the diverse lumber, building material, and hardware store
group. Sales of furniture and appliance stores declined for the fifth
successive month. The weekly figures for February, however, suggest that
furniture and appliance sales may finally be recovering somewhat.
Nondurable goods sales in January were up 1.4 per cent from
December, with significant increases occurring in sales of apparel and
food stores. The important general merchandising group, however, was
virtually unchanged from December.
Over the year, sales of all retail stores were up 6.4 per
cent, with sales of durable goods stores rising 10.5 per cent and the
nondurable goods stores increasing 4.6 per cent.
Unit auto sales and stocks. Sales of new domestic autos rose
in the second 10 days of February and for the first 20 days were at a

II -12
seasonally adjusted annual rate of about 8.4 million units, up 6 per
cent from the same period last month and, also, a year earlier.
Dealers' stocks increased about seasonally over the first ten days of
February and, on February 10, were 26 per cent above a year ago when
supplies were curtailed by work stoppages.
Consumer credit. Judging from early reports, the rate of
growth in instalment credit outstanding slowed in January, for the third
month in a row. The slower rise was not unanticipated: Retail sales
have been slack this winter, new car sales have been declining, and
personal income gains have diminished. Consumers are apparently becom-
ing more cautious in adding to debt, after sharply reducing their rate
of saving in the summer of 1968.
On balance, the January rise in instalment credit outstanding
is not likely to exceed $8-1/2 billion, at a seasonally adjusted annual
rate. This compares with a $10 billion rate in each of the final two
quarters of 1968, and is about equal to the rise in the second quarter
of last year. Demand for personal loans remained quite strong last
month, but further weakness was evident in the automobile and other
consumer goods components of the total.

Revised figures (not yet released) indicate that instalment
credit extended for new car purchases declined markedly from October to
December at commercial banks, sales finance companies, and other lending
institutions. The reduction reflects a substantial drop in the number
of autos financed, partly offset by a modest rise in the size of the
average loan.
In December, instalment credit extended for new cars totaled
$19.3 billion (seasonally adjusted annual rate), down $1-3/4 billion
from two months earlier and the lowest figure since June. The bulk of
the decline in loan volume occurred at commercial banks, and may reflect
some reorientation of loan portfolios away from the consumer sector to
business customers. Commercial banks, which generally account for
three-fifths of the dollar volume of consumer new car financing through
direct loans and purchased paper, experienced a contraction of $1.4
billion in extensions.
New car loans at sales finance companies and other lenders
eased slightly. The relatively better showing of the non-bank lenders
is mainly attributable to larger-than-average increases in the size of
loans extended.
There is evidence that the reduction in new car lending
extended into January. Sales of domestic autos declined moderately,
and sales of imported models were retarded because the dockworkers'
strike limited deliveries. Since the proportion of credit sales to
total sales of new cars generally changes little from December to
January, extensions are likely to reflect the decline in unit volume.

II -14
In addition, loan demand may have been moderated by increases in
commercial bank auto rates that were announced in such key cities as
New York, Chicago, Dallas, and San Francisco.
Personal income. Personal income rose only $1.6 billion in
January to $715 billion (seasonally adjusted annual rates). This was
the smallest increase in more than a year. The major factor limiting
the January gain was the increase in social security tax rates, which
reduced the over-all rise in income by $1.8 billion. At the same time,
the petroleum and longshoremen's strikes and bad weather helped hold
back the increase in wage and salary disbursements to $2.4 billion in
January, down sharply from $4.4 billion in both November and December.
Aside from these special factors, the wage and salary payments
picture remained strong. The rise in durable goods industry payrolls
accelerated--reflecting increased employment and higher hourly wage
rates--although the petroleum strike held the over-all manufacturing
advance down to $0.8 billion. Trade and service payrolls rose sharply,
with the advance in trade particularly strong. Transportation payrolls
declined slightly because of the dock strike.

Census consumer buying intentions. According to their
January survey, the Census indexes of anticipated expenditures on new
cars and houses declined again and were down considerably from their
July 1968 peaks. The index of expected expenditures on used cars
remained at the low October level. Plans to purchase household durables,
however, increased significantly--attaining a new high for the series.
The Census Bureau suggests that the January level of the index
of new car expenditures implies unit purchases by households at about
the same rate as in the first half of 1968, which was considerably below
the rate in the last half of the year.
This quarterly survey is based on a probability format which
requires respondents to rank their buying intentions on a scale from 0
to 100. This new form of the survey has been taken on a full sample
basis only 9 times, and the lack of predictive value of the previous 8
surveys led to a reweighting of the basic data and to large revisions
in the indexes (except for housing) just prior to the latest survey.
As a result, the January survey is the first one incorporating the new
weighting system on a current basis. It might be noted that the antici-
pated level of new car purchases is particularly suspect in view of the
poor forecasts--even after the reweighting--in the second half of 1968.

Durable goods new orders. The value of new orders for durable
manufactures increased slightly in January, according to the advance
report, and was at a level equal to the strong fourth quarter average
and exceeded only by last October when ordering showed an unusual 7 per
cent increase. Orders for iron and steel and motor vehicles increased.
Orders for fabricated metals dropped to a level lower than any month of
1968, reflecting a sharp drop in orders for the building materials group.
Defense ordering dropped back from a high December level, and orders for
machinery and equipment were unchanged.

Durable goods shipments rebounded in January to a new high,
increasing in every major industry except aircraft, but the backlog of
unfilled orders continued to rise in most industries.
Trade and manufacturing inventories. Book value of trade
and manufacturing inventories rose $700 million, seasonally adjusted,
in December, less than the October-November average rise. Sales were
relatively weak in December and stock-sales ratios generally increased,
but there appeared to be less imbalance in manufacturing than in trade.

More than half of the $500 million December increase in manu-
facturers' inventories was in durable goods in process, as production
responded to high levels of new and unfilled orders. In fact, durable
goods inventories declined relative to unfilled orders; this ratio is
actually below its 1964 (pre-Vietnam) level, although higher than it was
in late 1966 before 1967's sharp drop in accumulation. Moreover, non-
durable goods inventory-sales ratios are still low in manufacturing. In
spite of recent increases in materials ordering, occasioned by rising

II -19
production and by hedging against price hikes around the turn of the
year, the level of materials held and on order at domestic manufacturers
does not seem excessive in relation to the levels of sales and unfilled
orders for manufacturers' "end products" (products other than the inter-
mediate materials for manufacturing which are covered in the concept of
"materials held and ordered").
Trade inventories in December rose about $200 million, as a
$250 million increase at retail was partly offset by a decrease at
wholesale. Although the retail increase was less than in previous
months, the retail data, unlike the manufacturing data, do suggest grow-
ing imbalance between stocks and sales. Durable goods retail stock-sales
ratios are high and rising, both at automotive dealers, where a further
increase in January and February is likely, and at other durable goods
retailers. The December increase in the nondurable retail stock-sales
ratio was large, but this ratio was only slightly above the year-ago
level.
Leading indicators. The Census Bureau's index of 12 leading
indicators rose slightly further in January. The October peak has been
revised downward so that the series now shows continued small increases
since then. The coincident and lagging indicators continued strong.

Five new leading indicator indexes are now available, each
covering a separate "economic process." They are more irregular than
the 12-indicator composite but have longer leads on downturns. Like
the 12-indicator composite, they have remained at high levels in recent
months.
Construction and real estate. Seasonally adjusted expenditures
for all new construction--which were revised upward by 1 per cent for
November and December--remained near the record December rate in January,
according to preliminary estimates of the Cenus Bureau. Outlays for
nonfarm residential construction at an annual rate of $30.6 billion were
indicated to be substantially above the improved year earlier level.
Nonresidential construction continued to edge off from the recent peak
reached last October, apparently owing mainly to a moderate downward

II -21
adjustment in outlays for commercial buildings. Public construction,
which had accelerated in December, moved even higher in January. However,
with over-all construction costs up about 6 per cent on a year-to-year
basis, residential construction activity was the only major category
above a year earlier in real terms.

Private housing starts, which had dropped sharply in December,
surged above the recent November peak in January and, at a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 1.82 million, were the highest since February of
1964. The January spurt reflected in large part an expected initial
acceleration of schedules by builders in response to the tightening in
money markets which began toward the end of last year. Both single-
family and multifamily structures shared in the upturn, although the
volatile multifamily group showed by far the largest advance. Among
individual regions, the month-to-month rise exceeded 50 per cent in the

II -22
Northeast and North Central states. Only in the West, where unusually
heavy rains were a clearly limiting factor, did starts decline.

Unlike starts, building permits dropped in January, and with
outstanding mortgage commitments built up during last year's second half
now under increased downward pressure, an appreciable drop from the
exceptional January rate of starts is indicated for the period ahead.
Builders will probably continue to attempt to keep schedules as high as
winter conditions permit, however, given the uncertainties in financial
markets, expectations of further lumber and other cost increases and the
sustained high levels of demands for shelter. Consequently, in line
with earlier projections, housing starts in the first quarter as a whole
will most likely hold above the advanced 1.60 million rate reached in
last year's fourth quarter.

II -23
Underscoring the strength of demand pressures on builders in
recent months, rental vacancy rates dropped further in the fourth quarter
of last year to an average of 4.9 per cent of rental units available and
fit for use. This was the lowest rate in more than a decade and the
lowest for any fourth quarter since the inception of the quarterly series
in 1956. Homeowner vacancy rates averaged 1.1 per cent compared with 1.2
per cent a year earlier and a fourth quarter high of 1.4 per cent in 1964
and 1965. Also, while stocks of new homes for sale by speculative
builders were somewhat higher in December, the level of stocks of com-
pleted structures (as compared with those under construction) was still
exceptionally low and sales were advancing appreciably. Moreover, in
the market for existing homes, unit-sales in December were running a
fifth above a year earlier at prices averaging nearly a tenth more on a
year-to-year basis, according to the National Association of Real Estate
Boards.

Labor market. The labor market continued very tight in
January; the unemployment rate held at 3.3 per cent -- a 15-year low --
and nonfarm employment posted another substantial gain. However, there
have been slight indications of easing demand. The factory workweek --
a leading employment indicator -- declined between October and January.
Over the same period, initial claims for unemployment insurance -- also
a leading indicator -- edged up slowly. Thus far in February, the in-
crease appears to have slowed, but in the most recent week, such claims
were slightly above the year-earlier level.
Nonfarm employment rose by 260,000 in January (350,000, after
allowance for a net increase of about 90,000 in workers off payrolls
because of strikes). A significant part of the job gain reflected a
very sharp rise in trade employment (165,000) following an unusual
decline in December. The other public and private service sectors
exhibited their usual pattern of growth. Employment in construction
declined slightly from the previous month's peak.
Manufacturing employment continued to move up briskly in
January, with the largest increases in the metal-producing and metal-
using industries. The total gain (after allowance for increased strike
activity) was about in line with the average monthly increase since
October, thus continuing the very sharp advance in manufacturing employ-
ment. However, the average workweek was reduced from 41.0 hours in
September and October to 40.7 hours in December and January, with
shorter average hours in both durable and nondurable goods industries.
Reductions in hours of work were fairly widespread during this period;

II -25
in primary metals, machinery and transportation equipment, however, the
workweek continued at high October levels. In transportation equipment,
the workweek is likely to decline somewhat in February, reflecting the
production-inventory adjustment in the auto industry which didn't get
underway until late January.
The pattern of continued strength in January -- which is
normally a slack period for output and employment -- actually reflected
the fact that many workers were being retained on payrolls during a
month when they would normally be temporarily laid off. This may be
a sign of greater-than-usual demands, but may also reflect the fear
of losing workers in an extremely tight labor market. The retention
of workers now could slow the rate of increase in output per manhour
in the first quarter and cut into the normal seasonal employment pick-
up beginning in March.

The civilian labor force moved up sharply in January -- re-
suming a more normal growth path after lagging in the last half of
1968 -- but the gain in employment was equally large and the unemployment
rate remained at a very low 3.3 per cent for the second successive month.

II -26
The jobless rate for adult men edged up slightly to 2.0 per cent from
the low point reached in December. The rate for adult women remained
unchanged, while for teenagers it declined. The tightness in the labor
market this year has been reflected in a sustained decline in unemploy-
ment of 15 weeks or more. With the continued surge of employment growth
in January, there was a slight further decline in long-duration un-
employment, which reached a post-World War II low of 316,000.
With the labor market very tight, wages continued to rise at
about the same pace as in the past few months. Factory workers hourly
earning rose to $3.12 in January, and the average hourly earnings of
production and nonsupervisory workers on private payrolls reached
$2.95. Over the year, manufacturing hourly earnings were up by 6.1 per
cent and the private nonfarm figure was up by 6.9 per cent.
Unit labor costs -- total private economy. Despite accelerating
increases in compensation, unit labor costs for the private economy
maintained a fairly steady pace of increase throughout 1968, with most
quarters showing about a 4 per cent rise from a year earlier.
Although growth in output in the fourth quarter from a year
earlier was significantly smaller than preceding gains, manhours were
off slightly and output per manhour was up by 3.8 per cent over the
year, the largest such advance since early 1966. For the year as a
whole, the rise in productivity of 3.3 per cent -- close to the post-
war average -- was double that in 1967 and while unit labor costs were

II -27
still increasing rapidly, the rise of 4.0 per cent for 1968 as a whole
was less than the 4.4 per cent rise in 1967.

Wholesale prices. The BLS industrial commodity index in
January was 110.9 per cent of the 1957-59 average, as originally
estimated, but the December index was revised down a tenth of a point
(to 110.2) and the increase from mid-December to mid-January is now
0.6 per cent. This is the largest rise in wholesale prices of in-
dustrial commodities since the big steel wage settlement and price
rise in August 1956. Between mid-January and mid-February, however,
the rise moderated somewhat, with the BLS estimating an increase of
about 0.4 per cent (to 111.3). The number of industrial product
classes showing increases reached a new 1968-69 high in mid-January,
slightly exceeding the level reached a year ago. Since mid-January
the number of reported increases has declined though in mid-February
the number was still sizable.

II -28
The combined January and February increase in the industrial
price average represented a substantial speed-up from the 3.6 per cent
annual rate of increase over the last 4 months of 1968; the speed-up
to a rate of 6 per cent reflected, in the main, the sharp spurt early
this year in prices of nonferrous metals and steel mill products and
even larger increases, on average, in lumber and plywood prices. The
increases in basic metals prices occurred mainly in early January but
they continued -- at a slower pace -- in late January and early February.
Since mid-February they have subsided further. As for lumber and plywood,
the widespread publicity and special government attention now being
directed to the extraordinary price (and profits) rise over the past
2 years -- and its accelerating pace of recent months -- together with
the prospect for leveling off in housing starts, may cause the lumber
price rise to taper off. Average wholesale prices of lumber and plywood
in mid-February were up 37 per cent from a year ago and 50 per cent
from two years ago. For all industrial commodities, the price rise
over these two periods totaled 2.8 per cent and 5 per cent, respectively.
Price increases for steel, nonferrous metals, and lumber and
plywood accounted for about half the price rise for industrial commodities
in January and February. In January there were also sizable increases
for paper, nonmetallic minerals (mainly construction materials), and
producers' equipment.
The concentration of the recent industrial price rise among
materials -- particularly those classified as sensitive (which include

II -29
nonferrous metals, lumber, and plywood) -- and, to a lesser extent, in
producers' equipment is indicated in the table below. Average prices
of consumer nonfood products have shown only a slight upward drift
following the spurt last autumn which largely reflected the auto
price rise.

Consumer prices. The consumer price index increased 0.3 per
cent in January, to 124.1 per cent of the 1957-59 average. The rise
equaled that of January a year ago and, after allowance for usual
seasonal declines in commodity prices, was close to the average annual
rate of over 4.5 per cent prevailing over the year 1968.
The rise from December to January is typically held down by
sizable seasonal declines in prices of new and used cars and apparel.
This year these declines were less than seasonal and average prices of

II -30
nonfood commodities, which declined 0.2 per cent on an unadjusted basis,
rose 0.2 per cent after allowance for usual seasonal changes. This
rise was about the same as in the 2 preceding months and well below
the average rate earlier in 1968.
Food prices showed a pronounced rise in January, with meat
prices up more than seasonally and egg prices showing a sharp, contra-
seasonal increase as supplies were temporarily reduced. After allowance
for usual seasonal changes, food prices rose 0.5 per cent, to a level
2.3 per cent above the 1968 average. A rise of about this magnitude
from the 1968 average was recently forecast by USDA experts for 1969
as a whole; thus prospects are that retail food prices may not, on
average, increase much more over the balance of this year.
Costs of services showed a very large spurt in January: the
rise equaled the record 0.7 per cent per month of last June and July.
At that time sharp boosts in mortgage interest charges were a primary
influence. In January, these charges were moving up again but only
moderately. The main upward thrust came last month from other home-
ownership costs -- particularly taxes, insurance, and repair costs;
from sharply higher automobile insurance premiums (particularly in
New York); and from the largest increase in costs of medical care
since last March.

II -31
Outlook for agriculture in 1969. A relatively good year for
agriculture and for agribusiness firms was forecast by analysts partic-
ipating in the 1969 outlook conference at the U.S. Department of
Agriculture on February 17-19. This outlook was cast in a framework
of a general economy less ebullient than that of 1968 but one which
would support some further increase in domestic use of farm products
in 1969. Foreign demands for farm products were expected to be down a
little from 1968, partly because of increased grain crops abroad.
Larger domestic supplies of major farm products, especially
foods, were felt to be virtually assured, barring severe production
problems. Retail food prices at grocery stores were expected to average
only 1 to 2 per cent above 1968 as compared with the average increase of
3.2 per cent from 1967 to 1968; restaurant meals, however, were expected
to continue to rise at the 5 per cent annual rate of the past 3 years.
Total consumer expenditures for food were expected to increase 4-1/2 per
cent to 5 per cent with possibly 2 per cent of the increase in the real
volume of sales and the remainder in prices. Expenditures of food,
under these assumptions, were expected to amount to about 17 per cent
of projected disposable personal income, a little under even the record
low of 1968.
Spreads between retail prices of foods and prices received by
farmers for equivalent farm products were expected to average between 2
and 3 per cent wider in 1969 than in 1968.
For the farmers of the nation, the outlook was for somewhat
larger aggregate gross returns than in 1968, but with production expenses

II -32
expected to be up, net realized income was likely to be a little short
of the $14.9 billion earned in 1968.

It was assumed that both the net migration of people from
farms and the trend toward consolidation of farms into larger and more
efficient units would continue in 1969. With fewer farms, it was
expected that net income realized per farm would about match that of
1968.
Cash receipts from crops were expected to be larger in 1969,
reflecting substantially larger volume marketings from 1968 crop stocks
and 1969 current production at prices averaging a little below a year
earlier. It was expected that price support loan rates would continue
to dominate prices of foods and feed grains, cotton, and oilseeds.
Government programs for 1969 were designed to reduce production of wheat
and feed grains and to increase the production of cotton.

II -33
Cash receipts from livestock sales in 1969 were expected to
be up a little because of larger marketings. Marketings of beef, pork,
broilers, and turkeys were expected to be larger than last year and
marketings of eggs, milk, veal, and lamb, smaller. Producer prices
were expected to average about the same as in 1968.
For agribusiness firms in the product marketing and farm
supply sectors, further gains in sales in 1969 were deemed likely, but
their costs were expected to rise, although by a lesser rate than in
1968. The outlook for machinery demand was judged to be favorable,
especially for heavy units and for harvesting machinery for fruits,
nuts, vegetables and tobacco. Demands for petroleum products, ferti-
lizers, pesticides, and commercial feeds, which tend to parallel the
scale of production plans, were expected to continue strong.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL SITUATION
Bank credit. As measured by the daily average credit
proxy, adjusted to include Euro-dollar borrowings, member bank
credit is projected to show little change in February, following
a decline at a -2.0 per cent annual rate in January. In the first
two weeks of February, as indicated by the chart on the following
page, there was a surge in loans at weekly reporting banks. How-
ever, this loan expansion took place primarily at New York banks
and represented in large part apparently temporary increases in
loans to finance companies and to brokers and dealers, since these
loans dropped back sharply at New York banks in the week ending
February 19.
Other major loan categories also increased further in
early February. Business loan expansion resumed, after a pause
in late January, but at somewhat less than the January pace. The
recent increase was concentrated in loans to the retail trade in-
dustry, which again began to borrow heavily following repayment in
late December and January of much of the large fourth quarter rise
in their business loans. But continued borrowing by services and
construction industries, and a contraseasonal rise in loans to com-
modity dealers also added to the early-February rise in business
loans. The borrowing by retail trade and commodity dealers may be
associated in part with shipment delays resulting from the dock
strike. To some extent, however, the recent growth in business

loans is overstated, since holdings of bankers' acceptances included
in business loans remained almost unchanged in early February as
compared to large declines in comparable periods of most other re-
cent years. Growth in both consumer and real estate loans continued
at near the advanced pace of recent months.
With continued CD attrition and with the increased cost
of Euro-dollar funds, large banks reduced their security holdings
further in early February in order to accommodate these loan demands.
Most of this liquidation was in holdings of Treasury bills, which
fell by nearly $800 million in the first two weeks in February,
bringing the total decline since mid-December to about $2.3 billion.
New York City banks reduced their bill holdings by an additional
$483 million in the week ending February 19, leaving total bill
holdings of New York banks at only slightly more than $500 million.
Weekly reporting banks also have cut their holdings of
other securities since late December--reflecting principally liquida-
tion of both long- and short-term municipals. However, since banks--
particularly in New York and San Francisco--took large amounts of
long-term municipals into portfolio in the week ending February 12,
total holdings of other securities have remained relatively unchanged
in early February, although New York banks reduced their holdings
of longer-term municipals substantially in the week ending February 19.
As indicated by the chart on the following page, bank
accommodation of loan demands during the current CD run-off has entailed

a significant reduction in liquidity positions built up in the
summer of 1968. And although liquidity at large banks--as measured
by the ratio given here for the week ending February 12--still re-
mains above the low point in late 1966, the amount of unused loan
commitments at banks probably is much higher now than in 1966. In
that case, it would also seem likely that present liquidity needs
are greater, and that therefore this ratio may overstate current
bank liquidity as compared to that in 1966.
Bank deposits. Total time and savings deposits at large
banks continued to decline contraseasonally in late January and in
the first half of February. This reduction represented further out-
flows of CD's, and much less than usual growth in consumer-type time
and savings deposits.

From early December to mid-February, large banks lost nearly
$4.0 billion in CD funds, with New York banks accounting for almost
60 per cent of these losses. Through the first week in February,
this decline proceeded at about an average rate of $420 million
per week at all weekly reporting banks, and at a $240 million weekly
rate at New York banks. However, with the volume of maturing issues
in February well below those in December and January, outstanding
CD's at all large banks fell only by about $120 million in the
week ending February 12, and New York banks lost another $212
million in the week ending February 19. But while the dollar
volume of recent declines is somewhat reduced, it appears that New
York banks are now losing a higher percentage of maturing issues
than in December and January. Although banks with foreign branches
borrowed heavily in the Euro-dollar market during January as a
partial offset to these CD declines, bank liabilities to foreign
branches have shown little change, on balance, during the first
three weeks of February, as Euro-dollar rates rose to over 8 per
cent on all maturities by mid-month.
Flows of consumer-type time and savings deposits at large
banks since the end-of-December interest-crediting period were
similar to those after the March 1968 interest-crediting period,
when market rates also were quite high relative to Regulation Q
ceilings. Early in January, consumer-type time and savings deposits
declined sharply, as large outflows of savings deposits exceeded
the inflows of time certificates and open accounts. In the latter
part of January and in early February, the outflow of savings de-
posits fell off sharply while time certificates and open accounts

III -7
continued to expand at about the December pace. However, growth in
total consumer-type time and savings deposits remained substantially
below that in comparable periods of other recent years. Savings
deposits outflows of country banks in recent weeks have also slowed
from the large declines in early January, thus permitting resumption
of moderate, but again much less than usual, growth in total time
and savings deposits at these banks.
Following a sharply reduced rate of growth in January,
the money stock, measured on a daily average basis, is projected
to show little further change in February. U.S. Government deposits,
however--which rose in January after 3 successive months of declines--
are projected to increase again in February.
Nonbank depositary institutions. The slowdown in inflows
to thrift institutions which began late last year continued during
January. Technical difficulties with seasonal adjustment may have
exaggerated the January slowdown shown in the table, but the December-
January growth taken together nevertheless indicates a rate of
increase equivalent only to about the average rate-of interest credited.
Moderation of inflows apparently continued through early
February. New York City savings banks reported inflows as low as in
the same period of 1966, and San Francisco district savings and loans
received inflows at about the reduced pace of the year earlier. Daily
interest accounts, which pay less than 5 per cent, have helped to
sustain inflows to the New York savings banks.

During January, savings and loans made only seasonal changes
in cash and Governments which resulted in slightly decreased liquidity
ratios. A small increase in FHLBB advances was nearly offset bj a net
reduction in other borrowing. The backlog of mortgage commitments and
loans in process once again exceeded recent cash flow; an increase in
this ratio is normal during January, but its level indicated a rather
tight position.Both

Mortgage market. As flows to the thrift institutions
apparently continued to moderate and loan demands remained strong for
the time of year, mortgage yields increased further during February.
By February 24, the average yield on FNMA 6-month forward purchase
commitments of Government-underwritten home loans had reached 98 basis
points above the end-of-September low, according to the secondary
market "auction" results.

The additional increase in home mortgage yields during
February followed a further rise during January in both the primary
and secondary markets. Yields on FHA mortgages registered the second
largest rise of the postwar period, during a month when the regulatory
ceiling rate was raised to 7-1/2 per cent from 6-3/4 per cent. As a

III -10
result, the spread between FHA loans and new issues of high-grade
corporate bonds widened in January to the most favorable margin
since last September, although still somewhat below the average
prior to 1965. On conventional mortgages, however, the still
depressed yield spread improved only slightly.

Federal Reserve based on 7-1/2 per cent regulatory interest

with a change of 12 to 14 basis points in yield. Gross yield
spread is average mortgage return, before deducting servicing

Despite record costs, demands for home mortgage credit during
January appear to have remained stronger than usual for the slack time
of year. Sufficient funds continued to be available in most areas to
accommodate these demands, according to FNMA and FHA field reports,
although savings inflows to the thrift institutions were reduced.
In addition to the availability of high-cost credit from
private institutional lenders, FNMA forward purchase commitments and
loan purchases under the "auction" system have been providing substantial
support for the home mortgage market. Weekly bidding for FNMA forward
purchase commitments has been sharply higher since the ceiling on FHA
and VA mortgages was increased in late January. Most of the increase
has reflected builder needs for longer-term commitments at a time
when private lenders have apparently become more reluctant to supply
them in view of uncertainties about prospective cash flows. Also,
trade sources indicate that more bidders have been anxious to secure
FNMA commitments in ample time for delivery of the completed mortgages
to FNMA before next October 1, when the HUD Secretary's temporary
authority to set the ceiling on Government-underwritten mortgages
above 6 per cent will expire unless existing legislation is amended.
In response to the recent upsurge in bidding under the "auction"
system, FNMA throughout February has maintained the volume of its
purchase commitments considerably above the weekly average during recent
months, even though its backlog of commitments was already high. By
mid-February, FNMA's commitment backlog accordingly reached a record
$1.3 billion--equivalent to loans on about 87,000 new and existing

III -12
homes. Of this total, a third is scheduled to mature within the next
3 months and additional amounts could be delivered to FNMA prior to
maturity, depending partly on interim trends in yields on new
mortgage commitments. If there should be further substantial
increases in FNMA's costs of borrowing funds needed to take down
older commitments made when mortgage yields were lower, FNMA could
come under pressure to reduce its new commitment volume somewhat
over the period ahead.
The availability of home and other mortgage credit for non-
corporate borrowers has continued to be restricted in some States by
usury ceilings applicable principally to conventional home loans.
Rate limits of 7-1/2 per cent or less--already below the national
average--now prevail in 12 States, which altogether accounted for
about a fourth of the total number of single and multifamily building
permits issued last year. These States include New York, where
the regulatory ceiling was increased, effective February 16, to 7-1/2
per cent--the statutory limit. In addition, 16 States and the
District of Columbia, accounting for another fourth of total resi-
dential building permits, have 8 per cent usury ceilings.
Corporate and municipal bond markets. Yields on new
corporate and municipal bonds advanced to new highs early in February.
With investor demand lagging, a sizeable volume of bonds was
released from syndicate price restrictions; in free market trading
these bonds advanced 4 to 10 basis points in yield. More recently,
however, new bond yields have edged down slightly as underwriters have

III -13
priced issues aggressively--particularly in the corporate market.
Investor response to these lower yielding bonds has been mixed,
with good receptions generally accorded issues carrying attractive
characteristics such as 10-year call protection.

The aggressive corporate underwriter bidding behavior appears
to indicate a fairly optimistic appraisal of near-term yield developments.
In large measure this optimism seems to stem from the technical position
of the market, namely a low level of inventories and a relatively light
calendar of new issues. The estimated volume of corporate public bond
issues in February has been revised down $75 million to $725 million, or

III -14
one-third below a month earlier. While part of the lower volume reflects
a rescheduling of some convertible bond issues which had been expected
to be issued late in February, the bulk of the reduction stems from a
failure of the calendar to build up significantly as the month progressed.
Total corporate security issues in February, including private place-
ments and stock offerings, are estimated at $1.6 billion, well below
the pace of recent months.

Public corporate bond offerings already scheduled for March
aggregate about $600 million and further additions to the calendar are
likely to boost the ultimate volume to $800 million. Although this
would be up from February, the volume would still be nearly $100 million
below the 1968 monthly average. Underwriters report relatively few

III -15
issues in the pipeline for near-term offering and especially note a
lack of large industrial borrowers. As now constituted, the
calendar continues to reflect a heavy volume of public utility issues
and convertible bonds. These offerings, however, are not of sufficient
size to push the calendar to uncomfortably large proportions.
In the municipal market, the recent stability of yields
appears to reflect mainly a temporary respite from a heavy volume of
financing. The February volume of municipal offerings is estimated
at $950 million, $250 million below January. About two-thirds of the
month-to-month drop in volume is attributable to postponements and
cancellations due to the level of tax exempt yields. This lull in
new issues was useful to underwriters in their attempts to cut back
on inventories. With commercial bank purchases of new issues
apparently minimal, several of the large dealers are reported to be
actively seeking funds from individuals. Underwriters will likely
have to continue these efforts in the future, as the volume of new
issues in March is expected to rise to at least $1.0 billion.

Stock market. The sharp break in stock prices that began in
mid-February continued over the balance of the month, pulling the major
stock price indices from 9 to 10 per cent below their record highs of
last December./ This recent decline more than offset the mid-January
to mid-February rise that had followed the sharp price drop of late
December and early January. The mid-February break in prices coincided
with press reports and statements of Administration officials that public
policies must continue restrictive in view of inflationary pressures. In
addition, the Mid-East war scare and fear of an escalation of hostilities
in Vietnam may have also tended to weaken the market.

Trading volume, which so far in 1969 has tended to recede
from the seasonal highs of last December, was noticeably lighter
during the period of declining stock prices in February. The
adoption of a shorter trading day--in conjunction with the return
to a 5-day trading week--after the first of the year makes comparisons
difficult with daily trading volume in 1968. However, on a weekly
basis statistics are more comparable since the new trading week has
only 2 fewer hours than that which had been in existence since mid-
June (20 vs. 22 hours): the new trading week is much shorter than
the previous traditional one that had existed prior to mid-1968
(20 vs. 27-1/2 hours). Shorter trading periods, of course, had been
adopted in order to ease back-office problems. The new trading
hours, it is hoped, will ease the problem further by reducing the
hours of daily trading (from 5-1/2 to 4 hours). It is, as yet, too
early to determine whether this problem will be reduced, although
"fails to deliver" for member firms of the New York Stock Exchange
dropped back in January, after the sharp increase in December asso-
ciated with the spurt in trading that month.

Press reports in early February of the public risk associated
with the back office problem had no noticeable effect on the markets
and industry officials are reported to feel that the problem is now
beginning to come under control. More stringent regulations adopted
in recent weeks- by exchanges, by the NASD, and the SEC, as well as
the shortened trading day, should tend to reduce the "fails" problem.
However, record-keeping difficulties still exist and another surge
of trading volume would, no doubt, lead to another rise in "fails".
Both exchanges have recently commissioned research efforts to ease
transfer and record-keeping problems, but these are expected to
have pay-off only in the early 1970's.
Margin credit extended by broker/dealers, which has declined
each month since mid-1968, is now estimated to have remained unchanged
in December and in January it is estimated, on a preliminary basis, to
have declined almost $300 million--the sharpest single monthly decline
in the three-year history of the series. At the end of January, margin
credit extended by brokers was more than 11 per cent below the record
level of $6.7 billion reached at mid-1968. Securities credit extended
by banks rose $40 million in January, carrying the increase in such
credit to $340 million since mid-1968; this increase--which includes
credit extended to buy OTC stocks and bonds--offset only about one-
fourth of the reduction in credit extended by brokers over this period.
1/ These include increased limitations on trading for own account by
AMEX member firms; suspensions and other discipline of certain
broker-dealers by the SEC and the exchanges; mandatory "buy-ins" to
cover "fails to deliver" after a certain period of time; and a new
SEC rule--effective March 6--that required broker/dealers to deduct
a certain percentage of their "fails" from net assets after a
certain amount of time.

Government securities market. In the two weeks immediately
following the last meeting of the Committee, yields on Government
securities declined generally. Since then, those on longer-term
Treasury bills and coupon issues have advanced again, in many cases
to levels around the peaks reached at the beginning of the month,
while books were open on the February Treasury refunding. Yields on
short-term bills have been an exception, however; while they have
fluctuated rather widely since mid-February, they have remained
at relatively low levels on balance, with the 3-month issue dropping
to a low of 6 per cent and most recently quoted at 6.09 per cent.

In the Treasury's February refunding, the public chose to
exchange only $3.5 billion, or 64 per cent, of its $5.5 billion holdings
of the maturing issues; $2.6 billion of the public exchange was into
the 15-month 6-3/8 per cent note and only $885 million into the longer-
term 6-1/4 per cent 7-year note. The limited amount of debt extension
resulting from the financing, along with the unexpectedly large cash
redemptions and the limited volume of exchanges taken by dealers, all
strengthened the market technically and contributed to the post-
refunding decline in yields.
Yield increases since then have reflected growing recognition
of the cumulative impact of monetary restraint, fortified by Adminis-
tration statements stressing the need to maintain the fight against
inflation. In addition, yields on longer-term coupon issues have been
affected by indications that the Administration will seek an increase
in the 4-1/4 per cent interest ceiling on Government bonds. Against
this background, and under the pressure of continued CD attrition just
prior to an expected seasonal rise in loan demand, banks have extended
their security liquidation to include deep-discount Government bonds,
thereby adding to the general upward pressure on yields.
The failure of yields on short-dated Treasury bills to show
a sustained rise along with those on other maturities has reflected
the development of sizable investor demands at a time when dealers
have been reluctant to position bills aggressively. Demands have been
partly seasonal--coming in particular from public funds. But buying

III -22
from other types of investors seeking temporary liquidity--including
some who generally hold stocks--also has developed in sufficient
volume to keep dealer inventories at a low level. In fact, on some
recent days dealers reported sizable net short positions in bills
due in less than 92 days. The reluctance of dealers to position
bills more aggressively has reflected both the high current costs of
financing and uncertainties about possible near-term changes in the
discount rate and the prime rate.

This week's Treasury offering of a $1 billion "strip" of
month end bills--consisting of additons of $200 million each to issues
maturing in April through August--may provide some relief from the
recent technical shortage of supply in the bill market. However,
market participants had generally anticipated this financing and the
fact that the "strip" was smaller and less concentrated in short
maturities than some had expected lessened its impact on the shorter
bill sector.
Treasury finance. In testimony before the Joint Economic
Committee, the Budget Director recently expressed some uncertainty
about the viability of the $2.4 billion surplus projected in the
Budget document for the current fiscal year. But latest Board staff
estimates indicate that a surplus of about $2.0 billion is still a
reasonable possibility, While our fiscal 1969 projection of outlays
is about $1.5 billion higher than forecast in the Budget Document,
this change has been partly offset by an upward revision in our
estimate of receipts--prompted by the unexpectedly large January
tax payments. A downward revision in our estimate of the extent to
which banks can be encouraged to hold CCC nonrecourse loans accounts
for a large part of the increase in our spending forecast. If a
surplus of as much as $2 billion does develop, it will enhance the
possibility that the Treasury may be able to skin through the fiscal
year without a major debt ceiling problem, although the debt outstanding
is pressing so close to the ceiling that problems could develop quite
suddenly.

III -25
According to the latest figures available, the gross public
debt is within $2 billion of the $365 billion temporary debt ceiling.
Consequently, movements in the trust fund surpluses, which the Treasury
feels obliged to invest daily in new special issues, are a threat to
the ceiling. Staff projections indicate that the debt outstanding will
probably grow to within $3/4 of a billion of the ceiling on February 27,
but then decline again at month-end as special issues are drawn down to
meet trust fund benefit payments. There should be more leeway under
the ceiling for further growth of special issues during March, since
$2 billion of tax bills will be redeemed after mid-month.
Given the continuing uncertainty about the level of debt
subject to ceiling, the Treasury will probably be more willing than
usual to economize on its cash balance over the next two months. Even
so, our projections indicate a further temporary cash need of as much
as $1.5 billion during the first half of April. This would be in
addition to the $1.0 billion bill-strip already scheduled for payment
in early March.
To relieve debt ceiling problems after March, the Administra-
tion has asked for a conceptual change in the debt ceiling legislation.
Under this proposal debt held by trust funds would be excluded from
the ceiling limitation, but Federal agency debt, now exempt from the
ceilings, would be included. The net result would be to remove $75
billion of presently outstanding debt from the ceiling limitation and
to lower the permanent statutory limit from its present level of $358
billion to $300 billion, thereby allowing the Treasury more leeway.

The Euro-dollar market. Euro-dollar interest rates advanced
steadily during the first three weeks of February and are presently
over 8 per cent per annum for maturities of one month and more. The
largest advances were for call and one-month Euro-dollar deposits, the
rates on which increased a full percentage point between the end of
January and the third week of February. Rates for longer-dated ma-
turities advanced by about 70 basis points.
These unprecedentedly high rates appear to reflect continued
pressure from U.S. banks' bidding for funds in the face of a shrinkage
in the (net) flow of funds to the Euro-dollar market out of the major
European currencies.
American bank Euro-dollar borrowings from their foreign
branches have shown little change since the very large increase in
these borrowings that occurred between the year-end and the third
week of January. The outstanding amount of such borrowings is pre-
sently about $8.5 billion and has remained within about $200 million
of that level since the latter part of January.

Foreign exchange market developments. Exchange market
conditions have been reflecting the state of the Euro-dollar market.
Spot exchange rates for all the major currencies, excepting sterling,
have declined during February and forward quotations for the major
continental currencies have reflected the increased attractiveness
of Euro-dollar placements.
Any adverse effects that high Euro-dollar rates might
have had on sterling were apparently overshadowed by the news on
February 13 of a considerably improved British trade balance for
January. Thus far this month the Bank of England has purchased
about $270 million, most of which was added to reserves after the
January trade figures were made public at mid-month.
The Bank of Italy has sold nearly $200 million so far
this month to moderate a rather sharp decline in lira quotations.

IV -3
The Italian authorities indicated that most of the pressure on the
lira spot market probably reflected increasing Euro-dollar rates,
though there may have been some pressure arising from seasonal
weakness in the Italian current account. In order to discourage
Italian commercial banks from making covered Euro-dollar placements
through swaps with the Bank of Italy, that bank recently raised
the premium on forward lire at which it offers such swaps to 4 per
cent per annum, compared to a 2 per cent per annum rate offered in
early February.
The Swiss franc spot rate moved off fairly steadily
through the third week of February and the BNS sold about $50 million
shortly after mid-month. The franc market has turned around in
recent days, however, apparently reflecting the advent of tighter
Swiss money market conditions as the month-end approaches.
The Bundesbank has sold $850 million in the spot market
so far this month (about the same as the volume of spot sales for
all of January). New swaps entered into by the Bundesbank this
month, however, have totaled only about $200 million, compared to
more than $800 million in January. German bank demand for swaps
with the Bundesbank was less this month, despite higher Euro-dollar
rates, because the Bundesbank chose to discourage such swaps by
making their terms less attractive. At present the Bundesbank is
offering swaps at a 4-1/8 per cent per annum premium on marks.
Offsetting these gross deliveries of dollars to the exchange markets

IV -4
it is estimated that the Bundesbank will have roughly $1-1/4 billion
in receipts during all of February from the maturing of forward
contracts. Published German gold and foreign exchange reserves
increased by about $70 million between January 31 and February 21,
suggesting that Bundesbank sales of dollars in spot transactions
and through new swaps were indeed fully offset by maturing forwards.
Exchange markets for the other major currencies have
been rather quiet. Gold markets have been very quiet this month.
Prices on the London and Zurich markets have drifted up slowly
from about $42.55 at the end of January to their present level of
about $42.70,
U.S. balance of payments. A sizable deficit on the liqui-
dity basis seems to be shaping up, according to the preliminary
indicators, for the first two months of the year, but the period
is so much affected by unusual influences that it is probably
premature to draw conslusions. Some of the deficit in the early
weeks is likely to have reflected an outflow of some of the funds
that had been brought to the United States just before the end of
the year. The large deficit in mid-February may be connected with
the strike at East Coast and Gulf ports that interrupted loading
and shipping activity until February 15--and with the resumption of
import payments as goods in port began to clear customs. However,
January data are not available for trade or many other types of
major transactions.

IV -5
For January the earliest preliminary figure for the
liquidity deficit is $328 million (not seasonally adjusted), but
there are indications it may be revised downward as the coverage
improves; for February through the 19th the deficit, also unadjusted,
amounted to about $600 million. The seasonal adjustment would
raise the deficit for the first seven weeks of the year to over
$1 billion. Some scattered information is available on capital
transaction taking place in the period. Short-term claims on
foreigners reported by U.S. banks were reduced, according to early
reports, by about $200 million in January, which would be greater
than the usual seasonal inflow. Long-term claims changed very
little. Weekly condition statement figures for February indicate
little change in bank credit to foreigners through the 19th.
Sales of new securities by U.S. companies in the European
market have been well sustained, exceeding $300 million in January
and February. Since these were primarily convertible issues, and
were generally well received, it seems that the foreign demand for
U.S. equities was still very strong. It now appears that foreign
purchases of U.S. equity securities in January may have approached
$300 million, which would be a record amount.
U.S. purchases of new foreign bond issues were relatively
heavy in January, totalling over $250 million, and another $200
million was purchased in February. About $165 million of the
January total was for Canadian borrowers and $88 million for the
IBRD. Most of the latter amount was reinvested in U.S. agency
securities.

IV -6
Inflows from foreign governments included primarily the
quarterly German purchase of $125 million of DM notes under the
military offset agreement.
Inflows of foreign funds to U.S. banks through their
foreign branches amounted to $1.9 billion in January, but tended
to level off in February. Some of the rise in liabilities to
branches in January was offset by reductions in liabilities to
other foreign banks. As discussed in the preceding section, record
interest rate levels in the Euro-dollar market -- reflecting both
the tightening of U.S. money markets and some constriction of
supply abroad -- are likely to deter further large net inflows
from this source. As a result of this large inflow of private
foreign funds in January, the official settlements balance for
that month probably registered a surplus on the order of $1-1/2
billion. In February, through the 19th, this measure of the balance
registered substantial deficits as inflows of private foreign
funds subsided.
U.S. foreign trade. Data on U.S. foreign trade in
January are not yet available, but the value of both exports and
imports in that month was probably down sharply as a result of
the longshoremen's strike. About 50 per cent of the total value
of both exports and imports normally move by vessel through the
strike-affected ports. The strike began on December 20, and
lasted until February 15 in New York, a total of 55 days. Most
of the other struck ports are expected to reopen by the end of
February.

IV -7
The longshoremen's strike will affect trade values not
only in January and February but for several months thereafter as
cargo movements are accelerated to compensate for shipments lost
during the strike. In 1965, at the time of the last major port
strike when the port of New York was closed for a shorter period,
about 30 days, the value of exports and imports were distorted
through May.
While the primary effect of the longshoremen's strike
is to distort the timing of cargo movements, i.e., reducing them
in January and February and raising them in the succeeding months,
there may be some permanent effects. Foreign buyers of some items,
particularly agricultural products, may have switched to other
sources to obtain commodities for which they could not wait.
Encouragement regarding prospects for expanding U.S.
exports may be drawn from the more than 15 per cent increase in
foreign orders for U.S. machinery from the fourth quarter of 1967
to the fourth quarter of 1968. Shipments of machinery for export
rose by 10 per cent over the same interval, and the backlog of
unfilled orders rose by nearly 5 per cent.

IV -8
Foreign trade of industrial countries. The foreign trade
of the other members of OECD was substantially larger in 1968 than in
1967, their exports being 16 per cent greater while imports were up
10 per cent. Toward the end of the year their imports were rising
a little more rapidly than their exports.
The sizable expansion in these countries' exports reflected
continuation of the cyclical recovery which began in Europe in mid-1967
and the resumption in late 1967 of vigorous economic expansion in the
United States. Other factors were also at work. These included the
Kennedy Round tariff cuts at the beginning and in the middle of 1968,
the failure of the sterling devaluation to curb British import growth
(which increased by 9 per cent in real terms in 1968), and the surge
in domestic demand in France in the latter half of 1968.

Trade movements were erratic from quarter to quarter, but
the underlying pattern is clear. Imports of Western European countries
and of Japan grew rather slowly in the first half of 1968 and much more
rapidly in the latter half of the year, as consumption and investment
demands expanded. Their exports, on the other hand, advanced very
rapidly early in the year, when U.S. imports were increasing most
rapidly. Exports of European countries fell in absolute terms in the
second quarter as a result of the civil disturbances in France and also
in anticipation of the mid-year tariff cuts. There was a rebound in
intra-European trade in the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, total
exports of Western Europe, Japan and Canada rose at an annual rate of
14 per cent--slightly less rapidly than their imports--as European
exports to the United States and other countries outside Europe
leveled off.

The outlook in 1969 is for some slowdown in the growth of
world trade, primarily because of slackening in the rate of expansion
of U.S. demand. However, total imports of the other industrial countries
are expected to continue rising strongly, and to provide favorable
marketing opportunities for U.S. exports. The average level in 1969 of
Western European, Japanese, and Canadian imports combined is expected to
be more than 10 per cent higher than in 1968. This estimate assumes
strong German, Italian and Japanese import demand, combined with rising
imports by other Western European countries. British and French imports
together may be little changed from the level of the fourth quarter
of 1968. Canadian imports are expected to rise only moderately further.
Merchandise trade in the United Kingdom in 1968 was marked by
a sharp increase over 1967 in both exports and imports. The year-to-year
rise in the volume of exports was 14 per cent, that in imports, 9 per cent.
The gain in exports, reflecting both the vigorous expansion in world trade
and the advantages conferred by devaluation, was greater than had been
anticipated early last year. However, the British balance of trade--in
dollar as well as sterling values--deteriorated in 1968 compared to 1967.
The gain in the volume of exports was partly offset by a change in the
terms of trade against Britain after devaluation, as the dollar prices
of British exports were significantly reduced. However, the prime factor
holding back the improvement in the trade balance that had been expected
was failure of devaluation to damp the volume of imports.

IV -11
In the course of the year the trade deficit on a balance of
payments basis narrowed, from an annual rate of $2 billion in the first
half to about $1.4 billion in the second half. The decrease stemmed
from an upward trend in exports accompanied by a leveling off in imports
during the latter half of 1968.
Recent trade returns are encouraging. The average monthly
deficit in November-January was $62 million, considerably below the
average of any preceding three-month period in 1968.
The trade balance is likely to improve this year. Exports should
continue to gain, as they reap further benefits from devaluation, but the
rate of advance may be slowed if the rate of increase in world trade
decelerates this year. The effect of the restrictive measures imposed in
November--tighter installment buying regulations, a more stringent limit
on bank lending, higher indirect taxes, and the import deposit scheme--
coupled with what is likely to be an even more restrictive budget this
year than last makes it probable that imports in 1969 will rise only
moderately if at all over 1968.
German exports and imports both grew rapidly in 1968, the
former increasing by 14 per cent, the latter by 16 per cent over 1967.
The trade surplus in 1968 rose to $4.6 billion, 10 per cent higher than
the already unprecedentedly large 1967 surplus. The increase in the trade
surplus developed in the second half and was due in great part to large
increases in German exports, mainly to other European countries. Specula-
tive demand stimulated exports in the fourth quarter. Strong import

IV -12
demand from the United.States also contributed to German export growth
last year, the increase in shipments to the United States accounting
for about a quarter of the total rise in German exports from 1967 to 1968.
The rise in imports last year represented a continuation of
the advance which began with the recovery in 1967. Imports of semi-
finished and finished manufactures followed a sharply rising trend through
1968, while raw materials imports remained at high levels. The principal
beneficiaries of Germany's strong import demand last year--in terms of
dollar value of increases--were Canada, the United Kingdom, Belgium,
the Netherlands and Italy.
Slackening demand from Germany's customers coupled with rising
domestic demand and cost pressures may cut the increase in Germany's
export growth this year to 7 to 8 per cent. Vigorous internal demand
which may push the economy to virtually full capacity operation is
expected to maintain rapid import growth this year. With inventories at
the end of 1968 estimated as being only at their mid-1966 levels, further
rebuilding of stocks is likely to take place this year, and this should
provide an additional stimulus to imports. A continuation of last year's
substantial advance in imports and a deceleration of the rate of growth
of exports--reflecting to some extent the effects of the temporary
border tax adjustment--may reduce the trade surplus in 1969 by about
$1 billion.
French exports and imports increased at about equal rates from
1967 to 1968--by 12.7 and 12.4 per cent, respectively. The civil
disturbances in the second quarter caused a sharp drop in exports

IV -13
followed by a compensating rise in the third. Imports were similarly
affected, but fell less and then rose more, especially toward the end of
the year, despite temporary import quotas. As a result, the trade
deficit deteriorated substantially in the second half.
The outlook for French trade in 1969 is uncertain. In
spite of the large wage increases granted last spring, French exports
apparently remained competitive as the government offset higher wage
costs with various export subsidies and other measures such as preferential
rates of interest on export loans. The subsidies granted last year have
now expired, but their impact on exports may be partly made up for by
the institution in November of higher rebatable value-added taxes in
place of the wage tax.
The increase in imports is expected to be slowed by increases
in French taxes, rises in German export prices and restrictions on domestic
demand in France. The sharp rise in imports in the latter part of 1968
was attributable in large measure to the expansion in domestic demand
resulting from the wage increases of last spring. Contributing factors
were the Kennedy Round reduction in tariffs and the elimination of the
high French tariffs on intra-EEC trade. If the wage increases this
spring are absorbed without excessive price rises, the French current
account may be close to balance in 1969.
An acceleration in the rise of exports and a marked slowdown
during the first half in the expansion of imports produced a very substantial
improvement in Italy's trade balance in 1968. Imports for all of 1968 were

IV -14
only 6 per cent higher than the level of 1967. By contrast, exports
increased by 17 per cent. Domestic demand was sluggish in the first half
of last year, but a renewed rise in Italian industrial production in
the second half brought a strong economic recovery and rise in demand for
imports.
Italian exports have been moving up rapidly and quite steadily
since the summer of 1967. Exports to the United States and Canada boomed
in late 1967 and early 1968. They then leveled off from January to August
and fell by 15 per cent from August to October. But exports to other
areas moved up strongly throughout the year.
Italy's unusual trade surplus is likely to decrease slightly
in 1969. Internal expansion is expected to be more rapid this year than
last, and as a result the recent acceleration in imports will continue.
However, exports are also expected to continue growing strongly.
Dutch foreign trade increased markedly in 1968, as strong
domestic demand stimulated imports while a high level of economic
activity among the Netherlands' trading partners--most notably Germany--
gave a boost to exports. The rise in imports in 1968 over 1967 was 11 per
cent. The corresponding increase for exports was 14 per cent.
Exports this year are expected to increase by only about 8 per cent.
Domestic restrictive measures are being counted on to reduce the rate of
increase in imports to about 7 per cent.

IV -15
Both imports and exports of Belgium-Luxembourg have been
expanding fairly rapidly since the beginning of the general European
cyclical upturn in the third quarter of 1967. The advances in both
imports and exports paused in the second quarter, but resumed after
mid-year. Increased demand by France, Italy and the Netherlands
contributed to the second half export acceleration.
In Sweden, a sharp rise in imports occurred after mid-year--
reflecting a resumption of inventory accumulation after a prolonged period
of destocking. The increase in imports from 1967 to 1968 was 9 per cent,
compared to a 1966-67 rise of only 3 per cent. Swedish exports also
advanced by about 9 per cent last year, as against 6 per cent in 1967.
Canada's trade surplus of $1.1 billion in 1968 was the largest
since World War II. In trade with the United States, the balance swung
from a $600 million deficit in 1967 to a $100 million surplus in 1968.
While imports from the United States rose 14 per cent, exports increased
25 per cent. Two-fifths of this huge gain was the result of exports of autos
and auto parts stimulated by the U.S.-Canadian Automotive Agreement.
The trade surplus peaked in the second quarter of 1968 and was lowest
in the fourth quarter when imports surged in connection with the second
half boom in the Canadian economy.
Reduced growth in demand from the United States will sharply slow
the increase in Canadian exports this year to no more than 10 per cent
over 1968, about half the rate of increase from 1967 to 1968. Imports

IV -16
are expected to rise moderately further beyond recent levels, so that
the 1968-to-1969 increase may be about as large as last year's.
A 24 per cent increase in exports, accompanied by only an
11 per cent rise in imports, virtually eliminated Japan's trade deficit
last year. In 1967, the Japanese trade deficit had been about $1.2 billion.
The rate of advance of exports slowed somewhat in the second half of 1968.
Imports dipped in the first quarter as a result of the brief pause in the
Japanese economy's expansion at that time. The rise in imports resumed
in the second half of the year, and the 1969 outlook is for a further
advance (beyond the fourth-quarter level) at a rate in the range of
15 to 20 per cent.
