SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK
Outlook for economic activity
Spending by businesses and consumers continued strong in the
first quarter, but more than half the $16 billion increase in GNP
reflected more rapid price increases while real GNP growth continued to
moderate. The monetary restraint in process along with the proposed
curtailment of Federal Government expenditures and repeal of the invest-
ment tax credit are expected to contribute to a further slowing of GNP
growth to about $12 billion by the fourth quarter of this year. Since
only modest easing of price pressures is anticipated, the increase in
real growth would drop further, to about a 1-1/2 per cent rate by the
end of this year.
An important source of strength in the outlook for the
remainder of 1969 has been the bouyant capital spending plans of business-
men. The large gains in capital spending indicated for 1969 in the
Commerce-SEC survey were more recently confirmed by McGraw-Hill data.
But, as of now, it seems probable that the increased scarcity and cost
of investment funds and repeal of the investment tax credit, as
recommended by the President, should have some dampening effect on
business spending plans. Therefore, increases in investment outlays in
the last half of the year should be somewhat smaller than implied in
recent surveys.
Other sectors of demand also seem likely to show some waning
of strength as the year progresses. Construction activity appears to

I -2
have turned the corner, with housing starts expected to continue down
from the extremely high rate of early this year. Defense expenditures,
excluding the pay increase, are now estimated to decline instead of
holding steady. With growth of Federal expenditures likely to be
curtailed and some additional tax revenues coming in as a result of
the cancellation of the investment tax credit, the Federal budget can
be expected to be more restrictive than we had anticipated.
Consumer spending, although up from the sluggish pace of
late last year, has shown only modest growth in real terms. With
the saving rate already at the lowest level in 4 years, and with
hours of work expected to be curtailed further and employment gains
likely to slow, growth in consumer spending is expected to be
moderate in coming months.
Outlook for resource use and prices
In the current and ensuing quarters the rise in industrial
production is expected to slow down from the 5.5 per cent growth rate
in the first quarter--coming more in line with the reduced rate of
rise in real GNP. Roughly half the first quarter increase in industrial
production came from a sharp recovery spurt in steel, output of which
will rise very much more slowly from now on, or level off. Moreover,
the sharp first quarter rise in production of home goods had occurred
by January; since then output has changed little. Auto schedules
appear to have stabilized following a decline from the fourth quarter.
The production rise for manufacturing in the first quarter was about in

I- 3
line with expansion of capacity, but the rate of capacity utilization
is expected to drift downward for the remainder of the year.
Although employment in the first quarter of 1969 registered
the largest quarterly gain since early 1966, there was evidence of
somewhat slower growth in March. Further slowing of employment growth
is expected in coming months, and the unemployment rate is likely to
move up from the recent 3.3-3.4 per cent rate. While pressure on
wages is expected to continue strong, with continuing emphasis on
larger first-year wage increases in contract settlements, some
dampening of upward pressure is in sight as a large number of workers
begin receiving the smaller deferred wage increases (in the 4 to 5
per cent range as compared with first-year increases which averaged
about 7-1/2 per cent in 1968), and as, later this year, slackening
aggregate demand pressures diminish over-all demands for labor.
Prices of industrial commodities at wholesale have been
increasing at an exceptionally rapid rate, with especially large in-
creases for lumber and metals. Strong foreign demands have been
supplementing large domestic demands--particularly from the construc-
tion and business equipment sectors--and lumber supplies have been
limited. Some improvement in supplies and uncertainty about the housing
outlook are now causing the price rise for lumber and plywood to falter.
The industrial price rise should slow as construction activity drifts
down from the high first quarter rate, expansion in other demands
generally slows, and upward wage pressures begin to diminish-

I- 4
The consumer price rise accelerated sharply as the first
quarter progressed, mainly because of exceptional spurts in used
car prices and in mortgage interest charges and various other home
ownership costs--which are reflected to only a minor extent in the
GNP deflator. For the quarter as a whole the CPI increased at a
somewhat higher average rate than in the fourth quarter, but the rise
in the GNP consumption deflator apparently decreased. The outlook
for consumer prices is for a gradual abatement of the rise through
the remainder of this year.
Outlook for credit demands
Demands on credit and equity markets are likely to be on the
strong side between now and mid-year, given reduced corporate liquidity,
continued financing needs of State and local governments, and strong
housing demands. There was a sharp spurt in offerings of corporate
and State and local government bond offerings in April as the market
atmosphere improved. The pace of offerings in May and June may be
somewhat below the advanced April rate, though probably remaining above
the pace of late winter.
In the Government securities market, the Treasury will
announce its mid-May refunding by around the end of April. There are
almost $6 billion of publicly held issues maturing in May and June.
While the terms of the refunding will not be set for a week, the
market is discussing the possibility that an intermediate-term note
will be one option offered in the exchange.

I- 5
Demands for shorter-term financing, particularly from banks,
may continue at close to the high average first quarter rate. While
such demands may taper over the near-term with the passing of the
April tax period, corporate tax payments in June are about 25 per
cent above year-ago levels, and should require an enhanced flow of
credit at that time.
Mortgage borrowing demand at banks, and at financial institu-
tions more generally, is likely to remain strong, although supply
limitations may cut back actual borrowing. And unless there is an
unforeseen burst of buying of consumer durables, consumer loan growth
should be quite moderate. On the other hand, security loan demand at
banks could expand if expectations of declining interest rates over
the longer-term become more pervasive and dealers take large positions
in the forthcoming Treasury refunding and if underwriters or other
temporary holders begin speculating more actively in new corporate
and municipal issues.
Outlook for interest rates and supply of funds
The marketing of any sizable volume of intermediate- and
longer-term debt issues probably cannot be accomplished without an up-
ward movement of interest rates from current levels, since banks are
not likely to be active buyers of either State and local or U.S.
Government securities. A decline of interest rates from current levels
is unlikely unless either offerings are held back from the market or
investors are eager buyers of intermediate- and longer-term debt in

I-6
anticipation of lower interest rates later. The latter development
would help somewhat to limit seasonal downward pressure on short-term
rates, as investors diverted funds from liquidity instruments.
Mortgage markets are likely to remain under pressure over
the next few months, though the pressure probably will not intensify
markedly. Net outflows of savings from thrift institutions were
probably enlarged at mid-month, but, if experience in the first quarter
is a guide, net inflows in coming months are expected to return to
their modest earlier pace. Continued pressure on banks and increased
demands for policy loans at life insurance companies should also limit
funds available for mortgages. Given recent mortgage commitments,
and allowing for some tapering of commitments in the future, borrowing
by savings and loan associations from Federal Home Loan Banks may
increase some, and support of Government-underwritten mortgages by
FNMA may remain quite heavy.
The availability of bank credit is likely to remain limited
by very small net deposit inflows, with consequent inability of banks
to provide much support to securities markets and to finance dealers
at anything other than penalty interest rates. Growth in private
demand deposits, after spurting in April, is expected to show only a
minor, if any, increase over the next few months, a period when U.S.
Government deposits are expected to fluctuate at a relatively advanced
level. Attrition in outstanding negotiable CD's is likely to continue
at an appreciable rate through mid-year. The somewhat smaller maturities

I -7
in the months ahead may temper the amount of attrition, and if Treasury
bill rates decline as substantial Treasury debt repayment becomes a
reality, this could provide some additional room for new issues of
CD's. Outstanding consumer-type time deposits, which appeared to be
affected by April individual income tax payments, are expected to
resume a modest rate of growth.
Balance of payments outlook
During the second quarter net exports of goods and services
should be markedly larger than in the first quarter, as export
shipments belatedly make up for the earlier delays occasioned by the
port strike. This anticipated improvement in the current account may
not, however, be fully reflected in the over-all balance of payments
until well along in the quarter, if--as is thought to be the case--cash
settlements for U.S. exports lag behind shipments longer than import
cash payments do behind arrivals.
The continued large over-all deficit on the liquidity basis
in the first half of April, while consistent with the foregoing view
of trade settlement prospects, could also have other explanations.
The chances are that sooner or later some capital inflows that were
unusually large early in the year will diminish. In fact, foreign
buying of equities was already sharply down in March from the very
high January-February rate and the large bank credit reflow of
January was followed by outflows in February and March. Thus, despite
the expected rise in exports, the near-term outlook for the liquidity
balance remains cloudy.

I- 8
The current relationships between money market conditions
here and abroad seem to promise a continuing inflow of liquid funds
through commercial banks abroad. This will hold down the deficit to
be covered by official settlements. However, continuation of a
surplus in the accounts on this basis, while the liquidity balance
remains in deficit, looks increasingly unlikely. Whether U.S. demand
for Euro-dollars will be as intense as in the first quarter will
depend in part on loan demands in the United States and the course
of domestic interest rates. On the supply side, the tendency of many
countries in Europe to move their domestic interest rates up as their
economies become more fully employed may limit the flow into Euro-
dollars. Moreover, in the countries with large current account
surpluses--Germany and Italy--even though interest rates stay rela-
tively low, actions have been taken to cause their commercial banks to
repatriate liquid assets from abroad to meet domestic liquidity needs.

THE ECONOMIC PICTURE IN DETAIL
The Nonfinancial Scene
Gross national product. The $16 billion increase in GNP in
the first quarter almost matched the fourth quarter rise. But con-
tinued rapid price increases -- at over a 4 per cent annual rate --
accounted for nearly three fifths of this rise and real growth dropped
slightly, to about 3 per cent in the past quarter from 3-1/2 per cent
in the fourth quarter and 5 per cent last summer. For the current
quarter, GNP growth is likely to be close to the first quarter rate.
But a smaller increase in final demand is now projected for this
quarter, with slower growth in business capital outlays and less
strength in consumer spending. However, maintenance of inventory
accumulation at close to the first quarter rate, after a sharp drop
in the first quarter, and a very sharp rebound of exports following
the end of the dock strike are likely to sustain overall GNP growth.
The further tightening of monetary policy along with the
recently announced curtailment of the earlier estimated growth of
Federal government expenditures should act to restrict economic
activity further in the latter part of the year. Moreover, the
proposed repeal of the 7 per cent investment tax credit if enacted
may be having some impact before year end. Accordingly, we have
adjusted downward our projection for the second half of 1969, and
now anticipate that the rise in GNP will average about $13 billion

II -2
and real growth will decline to about a 1-1/2 per cent annual rate.
However, only a moderate easing of price pressures is expected by
year end, with the GNP price deflator slowing from the first quarter
rate of increase of 4-1/4 per cent to about 3-1/2 per cent.
The most important element of strength in the first quarter
was the continued rapid rise in business fixed investment. Such out-
lays have now jumped sharply for three consecutive quarters. But the
increase, estimated by the Commerce Department at $5.5 billion in the
quarter, was the largest in nearly two decades, in both current
dollars and in real terms. This strong increase has already brought
the level of capital spending to a level almost 11 per cent above
the 1968 average and it would not take a large further rise to
attain the 14 per cent year-to-year gain indicated for 1969 in the
recent Commerce-SEC survey.l/
Although the Commerce-SEC survey calls for a small dip in
capital spending in the second quarter followed by moderate gains for
the remainder of the year, the momentum of the very sharp rise since
the second quarter of last year suggests a continued increase in
capital spending in the current quarter, albeit a small one. Beyond
the second quarter, however, the moderate further gains in capital
1/ A more recent McGraw-Hill survey (confidential until released April 25)
confirms the continued strength in plant and equipment investment plans.
According to this survey, capital spending in 1969 is expected to be
about 13 per cent above the 1968 level. The survey also indicates that
plans for investment spending continue to rise for the years 1970-72.
This is the first time this survey has found long-term investment plans
showing such upward momentum so far into the future.

II -3
spending projected by the survey for the remainder of the year seem
likely to be trimmed somewhat in the light of recent monetary actions
raising the cost and restricting further the availability of funds.
The Administration's recommendation to eliminate the investment tax
credit, if enacted, may also have an impact on investment spending
decisions before year's end, although the substantial unused carry-
over of credits could operate to maintain investment spending for
some time. Nevertheless, the dampened tax incentive and the increased
cost and difficulty of obtaining credit have led us to cut the projected
increases in capital spending $1 billion a quarter below our previous
estimates for the second half of this year. Our projections call for
an increase of about 12 per cent for 1969 as a whole as compared with
the 14 per cent rise indicated in the February Commerce-SEC survey.
Residential construction activity also continued to show
substantial strength in the first quarter. But housing starts
dropped substantially from their earlier extremely high rate as the
quarter progressed. High interest rates and the further pressure
expected on the availability of mortgage funds are expected to reduce
housing starts from a 1.7 million rate in the first quarter to about
1.5 million in the current quarter, and an average of about 1.4 million
in the second half of the year. Most or all of this decline is likely
to be in single family housing, where interest rates and availability
effects are most pronounced.

II -4
Growth in final sales in the first quarter was also enhanced
by a sharp rebound in consumer expenditures after the lackluster per-
formance of late last year. About half of the $11.6 billion increase
in consumption in the first quarter was financed by a dip of a full
point in the saving rate. At 5.8 per cent, the saving rate had
fallen to its lowest level since early 1965.
Despite the relatively large first quarter increase, the
consumption picture in general has not been particularly strong.
Much of the expansion in the past few quarters has reflected rapid
price increases. In real terms, personal consumption expenditures
this past quarter were about 2 per cent, annual rate, above the level
in the third quarter of last year. Unit sales of domestic autos have
continued to edge down, averaging 8.4 million for the quarter, as
compared with 8.8 million in the fourth quarter and a 9 million
rate in the third quarter of last year. Sales for the first 20 days
of April appear to have been at a 8.3 million rate.
Growth in disposable income will continue to be curtailed
in the present quarter by large income tax payments on 1968 surcharge
liabilities. A spurt in incomes is expected in the third quarter as
Federal civilian and military pay raises take effect. But employment
and wage gains are expected to moderate thereafter as activity slackens
With the saving rate already at a relatively low level, there seems
little room for consumer spending to rise faster than incomes. Accord-
ingly, only moderate further gains in consumer spending seem likely
over the next three quarters.

II -5
In contrast to the strength in most sectors of final demand,
a distinctly slower rate of inventory accumulation was reported early
in the first quarter. However, the adjustment appears to have been
largely concentrated in January since the book value of inventories
rose briskly again in February. Inventory accumulation may be held
down somewhat in the current quarter by the outflow of goods follow-
ing the dock strike, but more rapid accumulation is likely again later
in the year, particularly, if our estimate of only moderate gains in
personal consumption expenditures is realized.
With the dock strike now over, a very sharp recovery is
anticipated in exports, with net exports adding perhaps $6 billion
to GNP in the current quarter. This is in contrast to a zero in-
crease in net exports of goods and services shown for the first
quarter. However, as noted, some of the increase in exports is
expected to come out of inventories, where goods have been accumulat-
ing because of lack of shipping, and the impact on output is likely
to be somewhat less than would normally be suggested by a rise in
exports of this magnitude.
Among the most significant new factors affecting the outlook
for activity levels in the second half of 1969 are the reductions
recently proposed in Federal outlays from the levels in the January
budget. The rate of increase in Federal purchases of goods and
services has already shown signs of leveling off.

II -6
We have incorporated the new expenditure figures in our
projections. As a result, our projection of Federal purchases of
goods and services in the fourth quarter has been reduced by $1.3
billion. Lower expenditures and the repeal of the investment tax
credit should make the Federal budget more restrictive in the
second half of this year than we had previously expected. We
currently are estimating a surplus of about $4 billion in the
third quarter and $6 billion in the fourth, instead of the $1.5-
2.0 billion projected in our last Greenbook.

Industrial production. Industrial production in March rose
further to 170.5 per cent of the 1957-59 average--up 0.6 per cent
from February and 1.1 per cent from December. Gains in output were
widespread for final products and materials.
The total index rose at an annual rate of 5.5 per cent
from the average of the fourth quarter of 1968 to the first quarter
of 1969--about the same rate of increase as from the third to the
fourth quarter of 1968 (See table).

Large declines in output of autos and defense equipment in
the first quarter of 1969 were more than offset by the sharp recovery
in steel production. Steel production is expected to rise further in
the second quarter of the year, but at a substantially slower rate.
Auto assemblies are scheduled at an annual rate of 8.4 million units in
the second quarter, compared with output at a rate of 8.5 million units
in the first quarter, and 9.1 million units in the fourth quarter. So

II -10
far in April, however, output is running well below the projected rate,
mainly because of strikes at Chrysler.
Sales of new domestic autos also declined in the first
quarter, to an annual rate of 8.4 million units from 8.8 million
units in the fourth quarter of 1968. In the first 20 days of April,
sales were at an annual rate of 8.3 million units. Dealer's stocks
were about unchanged from a month ago, and on April 10 were nearly
a fifth above a year earlier.
The sharp rise in output of home goods that began in
mid-1968 may be tapering off. While overall production of these
goods was considerably higher in the first quarter of 1969 than in
the last quarter of 1968, output changed little from January to
March. In that period, production of television sets continued to
increase, household appliances leveled off, and furniture declined.
The slowing of the rate of increase in production of
business equipment in the first quarter of 1969 was due mainly to
the sharp cutback in production of farm tractors, in an effort to
reduce excessive inventories, and to a leveling off in output of
freight and passenger equipment. While the increase in total output
of business equipment is expected to be larger this quarter as pro-
duction of farm tractors recovers, it probably will not equal the
rate of growth in the expansion period from mid-1963 to the end of
1966. In the three years 1964-1966, production of commercial aircraft

II -11
rose at an annual average rate of over 30 per cent. Because of
capacity limitations in the aircraft industry, output changed little
in the last half of 1968 and then rose only moderately in the first
quarter of this year.
The slower rate of growth in output of nondurable materials
in the first quarter of 1969 as compared to the previous quarter
resulted from a decline in production of textile mill products and
a leveling off in output of industrial chemicals and rubber products.
Capacity utilization. The March rate of manufacturing
capacity utilization was estimated at 84.1 per cent, up slightly
from the previous month. As has increasingly been the case recently,
the operating rate for primary processing industries (those in-
dustries which for the most part produce materials) was above the
rate for all manufacturing.
Some materials-producing industries are now operating at
high levels. Seasonally unadjusted output of paper, primary aluminum,
and rubber products is close to capacity. Operating rates in the
aircraft and motor vehicle industries remain above normal. Producers
of most other manufacturing products apparently have appreciable
amounts of unused capacity.

Retail sales. Retail sales in the first quarter were at an
annual rate of 5.7 per cent above the second half of 1968. Durable
and nondurable goods stores shared equally in the gains. Within the
durable category, most of the rise was attributable to strong increases
in building material and hardware sales and higher furniture and
appliance sales, which picked up in January after declining earlier.
In contrast to the decline in unit sales of autos, the automotive
group of retail stores increased slightly. Among the nondurable
groupings food stores and gasoline stations accounted for most
of the rise. The important general merchandise group showed no in-
crease over the average of the second half of 1968.
The January sales increase from the weak December level
accounted for much of the first quarter jump in sales, but the
February gain was also substantial, and sales in March were 0.8 per
cent higher than February according to the advance release. March

II -13
sales of durable goods stores were up somewhat less than those of
nondurable stores, as the furniture and appliances, and building
material and hardware stores, which were major elements of strength
earlier in the quarter, declined. However, higher dollar sales for
the automotive group and the farm equipment stores more than made
up these losses.
Sales in the nondurable goods categories in March continued
to be bolstered by large gains for the food group and gasoline stations.
The general merchandise and apparel groups were off somewhat from
February.

Consumer credit. The rate of advance in consumer instalment
credit extensions has slowed considerably since last summer. During
the first quarter of 1969, new credit extensions are estimated to have

risen approximately $1 billion further at a seasonally adjusted annual
rate--about equaling last year's fourth quarter rise, but much below
the $3.9 billion average rate of increase during the first three
quarters of 1968.

The major components of the total have behaved quite
differently. Extensions for auto purchases rose sharply last summer
when domestic new cars spurted and used car sales were running at a
high level. While both unit sales and credit extensions slackened
in the fourth quarter, a further decline in sales so far this year
has not been reflected in a comparable slowdown in credit extensions--
mainly because a larger proportion of new car sales are being financed.
Since mid-1968, credit extensions for other consumer goods
have not moved with retail sales of GAF merchandise. Extensions were

II -15
unchanged in the third quarter of last year despite a substantial
increase in GAF sales, and rose more than $1 billion in the fourth
quarter when sales declined. It appears that the rate of extensions
was down slightly in the first quarter of 1969, although GAF sales
were at a new peak.
The volume of personal loans has risen erratically over this
period. In the first quarter of this year personal loan extensions
increased by about $3/4 billion, as compared with an average quarterly
increase of slightly less than $1 billion in 1968. However, quarterly
gains last year ranged from a high of nearly $2 billion in the third
quarter--when consumers stepped up their spending and borrowing after
imposition of the surtax--down to about $1/4 billion in the fourth.
With repayments more stable than extensions, the slower
growth in extensions has produced a similar slowdown in the rate of
growth of instalment credit outstanding. During the first quarter
of 1969 outstandings are estimated to have grown at an annual rate
of about $8-1/2 billion (seasonally adjusted), compared to a rate of
over $10 billion in both the third and fourth quarters of last year.
On balance, it appears that consumers have become less
aggressive users of instalment credit in recent months. Increases
in interest rates on auto and personal loans earlier this year, and
the numerous media references to "tight money" conditions, have
probably had some limiting effect. On the other hand, there are few
indications that commercial banks and other lenders have become reluctant
to extend consumer loans to "credit-worthy" borrowers.

Durable goods new orders. The value of new orders for
durable goods dropped 4 per cent in March from February's record high,
according to the advance report. The March rate was a little below
the November and December levels. A drop in defense ordering--large
even for this volatile series--was the principal element in the
decline. Motor vehicle "orders" were also down as shipments declined.
Orders for fabricated metal products increased but were still below
the fourth-quarter rate. Machinery and equipment orders, though down
somewhat, remained at advanced levels, as did other major industry
and market groups.

II -17
Unfilled orders declined slightly, mainly because of a 2 per
cent drop in the aircraft industry. Backlogs for other industry
groups showed increases or only small declines.
Inventories. Total business inventory accumulation dropped
from a $10.6 billion annual rate in the fourth quarter to $6.4 billion
in the first quarter, according to the preliminary GNP estimate. After
a relatively small increase in January, the book value of manufacturing
and trade inventories rose over $1 billion in February as nondurable
goods stocks jumped.

Growth in the book value of durable inventories slowed in
January and February, as auto production was reduced to about the
level of sales and durable inventories were cut at other retail and

II -18
wholesale establishments. Durable manufacturers were building
inventories at a somewhat faster rate than in the fourth quarter.
Continued additions to durable inventories seem likely in view of
declines in ratios of inventories to sales and backlogs and also in
view of plans of durable manufacturers surveyed by Commerce in Feb-
ruary to increase their stocks relative to sales. Furthermore, the
value of durable materials inventories is low and declining relative
to durable goods sales and backlogs, in particular, steel held by
consumers and producers in February was a relatively low 5.2 months'
supply at current rates of use. The defense industries might prove
to be an exception to this general outlook; inventory-backlog ratios
were already quite high in February, and the backlog declined in
March.
The average monthly increase in nondurable goods inventories
in January and February was about the same as the fourth quarter
average. The stock-sales ratio has been increasing since September,
particularly at wholesalers and manufacturers of nondurable goods
where sales in January and February were below fourth quarter levels.
At nondurables factories, inventories of finished and in-process
goods were rising relative to shipments, while materials holdings
continued low. Nondurable industries with rising inventory-shipments
ratios include textiles, chemicals, and "other" (apparel, printing,
and leather). Decreases in the rate of nondurable inventory accumulation
seem likely, either through further pick-ups in consumer buying, or
failing that, through curtailments in production.

II -19
Construction and real estate. Seasonally adjusted outlays
for new construction, which were revised upward by 2 per cent to a
new peak for February, apparently rose further in March to an annual
rate of $91.2 billion. While the year to year increase in March was
substantial--9 per cent, nearly all of it reflected higher construction
costs.
Within the private sector, residential construction expendi-
tures, still riding the crest of an exceptional starts performance
earlier this year, rose again in March. Outlays for nonresidential
construction were apparently little changed in March, but remained
near the record high reached in January when expenditures for both
industrial and commercial structures surged upward and other types
of nonresidential construction outlays also increased. By contrast,
public construction expenditures, though estimated higher in March,
were running well below the peak of last November. Given the large
number of State and local bond-issue cancellations reported during
the first quarter and Federal construction budget cuts planned for
fiscal 1970, further downward pressures on most types of public con-
struction are indicated.

Seasonally adjusted private housing starts declined further
in March, to an annual rate of 1.54 million. The drop, which was
somewhat greater than projected, left the first quarter average at a
level of 1.70 million--6 per cent above the advanced fourth quarter
of last year and just above the recent high in the first quarter of
1964. While both single-family and multifamily starts rose in the
first quarter, the reduction in the single-family starts rate since
January has been particularly marked. As a result, multifamily starts
accounted for a record 44 per cent of total starts in the first
quarter, compared with a 40 per cent share in 1968 as a whole.
Underscoring a trend which may continue through most of the
year, all of the decline in starts in March was concentrated in single-
family units. Moreover, the rise in multifamily starts was entirely
in the 5-or-more category. Regionally, total starts in the North Central

II -21
states and the South, which had led the recent advance, were down
sharply in March, but in the Northeast and West--where winter rains
had limited activity earlier in the year--starts showed substantial
gains.

Thus far, permits have fluctuated at a relatively high level
and mortgage commitments outstanding at thrift institutions have re-
mained exceptionally large not only in current dollar terms but also
after allowance for increased construction, land and other costs. How-
ever, a number of factors continue to point to maintenance of the down-
trend initially projected for the spring quarter, a period when seasonally
unadjusted starts normally are expected to advance about three-fifths ino

II -22
any case. Apart from further rises in interest rates and other costs,
these factors include (1) the unsustainably high rate of starts
actually averaged in the first quarter, (2) the intensified further
pressure on funds available from commercial banks, which provide
important support to builders in their drive to achieve the high
first quarter schedules, and (3) lumber and other materials limita-
tions which still remain a problem. Even so, total starts in April
will most likely hold at or somewhat above the reduced March rate for
technical and other reasons, and the level for the second quarter as
a whole may exceed the advanced 1.51 million rate averaged in the
year 1968.
While builders are reported to have lowered their sights for
1969 in the face of financial and other uncertainties, effective
demands for shelter apparently continue strong. Reflecting this
situation, stocks of homes available from merchant builders in
February, the latest month for which data are available were at
the lowest level in relation to sales since September. Median prices
of homes sold in February, at $25,300, were nearly a tenth above a
year earlier. In the market for existing homes, despite continuing
reports of limited selection, sales in February were running 10 per
cent above a year earlier, at year-to-year average price increases
of 6 per cent.

II -23
Business plant and equipment spending plans. According to
the results of the McGraw-Hill March survey of business fixed capital
investment plans (confidential until release April 25), new plant and
equipment expenditures this year will be 13.0 per cent larger than in
1968 and higher in each of the next three years than in 1969. The
Administration's proposal to repeal the 7 per cent investment tax
credit no doubt will result in review of present investment plans
and probably a scaling down of some of them, particularly those for
future years.
The 13.0 per cent increase indicated by this survey is not
much different from the 13.9 per cent rise reported in the Commerce-SEC
survey taken in February. Because of differences in the sample coverage
of the two surveys the small difference in the findings probably is
not significant.
This is the first McGraw-Hill survey in which plans for
investment outlays in future years have not fallen off from plans for
the current year. The sustained high level of in vestment being planned
in March for 1970, 1971, and 1972, even though present plans may be
revised down, probably reflects the continuing need to modernize pro-
duction facilities so as to reduce production costs, as well as the
desire to expand capacity, which increased by 6 per cent last year.
At the end of last December, manufacturers were operating at 85 per
cent of capacity, according to this survey. Fixed capital outlays

II -24
planned in March would increase manufacturing capacity by 7 per cent
this year and an average of 6 per cent in each of the following three
years.
Personal income. Personal income increased $5.3 billion in
March, matching the February rise. Continuing strength was registered
in wage and salary disbursements, which accounted for 80 per cent of
the total increase.
Manufacturing payrolls recovered sharply in March from a
slight decline the previous month. The $2.3 billion March increase,
the largest since May a year ago, was attributed by the Commerce
Department to higher employment, hours and hourly earnings. Part of
the increase reflected return of strikers in the transportation equip-
ment and petroleum industries, and a large portion was due to a rebound
in the workweek, which had dropped sharply in February because of heavy
snows in the North East. The first quarter increase in manufacturing
payrolls was $2.7 billion, half a billion dollars below the preceding
quarter's rise, largely because hours of work declined and the rate
of increase of hourly earnings slowed somewhat. Nonmanufacturing pay-
rolls rose by $8.8 billion, reflecting continued large increases in
employment and wage rates.

Despite the large rise in current dollar personal income,
the growth in real disposable personal income dropped further in the
first quarter. Retroactive tax payments, the boost in social security
taxes and the rapid rise in prices all figured prominently in slowing
the rise to an annual rate of less than one-half of one per cent. The
last time that growth in such income was as low as in the past 3
quarters was during the 1960-61 recession. Between mid-1961 and mid-
1968, the annual rate of increase in real disposable income averaged
slightly more than 5 per cent.

Labor market. The labor market continued tight through March
and into April. Working hours have been cut back somewhat in the con-
sumer goods industries and employment has been reduced in some of the
defense industries, but there have been only moderate layoffs, and
insured unemployment and initial claims for benefits remained below
low year-earlier levels in early April.
Largely because of a seasonal adjustment problem with
construction employment, the March advance in nonfarm payroll employ-
ment was only half as large as the average monthly increase from
September though February. Exclusive of construction, the employ-
ment advance was slightly smaller than in other recent months and
included the return to work of about 28,000 workers who had been on
strike in February. The unemployment rate edged up to 3.4 per cent
in March, reflecting a rise in teenage unemployment. Adult joblessness
continued near frictional levels. Despite the continued tightness of
the labor market, the average rate of increase of wages has eased
slightly in recent months.

Employment. Nonfarm payroll employment rose 147,000 in
March,with all industry groups except construction reporting higher
job levels. The only decline occurred in construction, which had not
shown the normal seasonal employment contraction during the winter
months. In February, construction employment had risen by 110,000,
seasonally adjusted, because layoffs were lower than usual. As a
result, many of the workers who would normally be rehired in March,
when activity expands seasonally, were already working and the hiring
rate fell below normal seasonal levels. Over the next few months con-
struction hiring would normally increase seasonally; with the supply
of skilled workers very slim, costs rising rapidly, and mortgage funds
limited, gains this year appear likely to be below normal.
Manufacturing employment rose 65,000 in March, but nearly
one-third of the advance was attributable to the return to payrolls of
striking workers in the petroleum and aircraft industries. The bulk
of the remaining increase consisted of moderate gains in primary and
fabricated metals, electrical equipment, and apparel. Over the past
6 months, labor demand has continued strong in the capital goods
sector, but has eased somewhat in both the defense group and in con-
sumer goods manufacturing.
Compared with a year earlier, manufacturing employment was
up half a million with about one-fourth of the advance occurring among
managerial and administrative personnel. Production work employment
was up sharply over the year, with the bulk of the advance occurring

II -28
over the past 6 months. Over that same period, however, the average
workweek of factory production workers was cut by half an hour and
the growth rate of total production worker manhours declined. Sizable
cuts in hours occurred in such consumer-goods industries as apparel,
autos, textiles, rubber, leather, and miscellaneous manufacturing.
Growth in production worker employment in these industries was very
modest. In the defense group, average hours fell sharply in ordnance
and employment declined in the aircraft industry. Easier labor
demand in the consumer goods and defense industries has been offset
by hiring in the capital goods industries, where manhours have risen
strongly over the past 6 months.

Labor force and unemployment. The strong first quarter rise
in employment was drawn mainly from labor force growth, although the
unemployment rate edged down from 3.4 per cent in the fourth quarter
to 3.3 per cent in the first quarter. In the first quarter of 1969,
the civilian labor force increase from a year earlier amounted to
1.9 million, up sharply from much smaller year-over-year advances
during the last 2 quarters of 1968 and much greater than the anticipated
"normal" growth of about 1.4 million.

Historically, labor force growth has tended to fluctuate
around the expected normal growth, with sharp spurts followed by
slower growth and vice versa, depending on both economic developments
and work attitudes among marginal groups. To some extent, the first
quarter surge probably represents a catch-up from the slower growth
pattern of the last half of 1968.
Despite the acceleration in labor force growth, unemployment
has continued low. In March, joblessness among adult men continued at

II -30
its lowest point since World War II, while the rate for adult women
continued at a post-Korean low. The volatile teenage rate rose
somewhat. About three-fourths of the unemployed teenagers were just
entering the labor force and approximately half of them wanted part-
time work.
Earnings. The rate ofgrowth in hourly earnings in the
private economy eased somewhat in early 1969 from the accelerated
rates of 1968. At an annual rate of about 6 per cent in the first
quarter, growth in production and nonsupervisory workers hourly
earnings was sharply lower than in the first quarter of 1968 when
there was a large increase in the minimum wage. Despite the easing,
earnings were still increasing at an exceptionally rapid rate.
Easing of earnings growth was particularly pronounced in
manufacturing where the quarterly growth rate in early 1969 fell below
5 per cent for the first time since late 1967. Factors in the slowing
include a temporary let-up in collective bargaining activity and a
slight cutback in overtime hours at premium pay.

The slower growth in manufacturing earnings has developed
since December. Between December and March average hourly earnings
rose only 2-cents, compared with a 5-cent rise in the December-March
period of 1967-68 when the large minimum wage boost took effect.
In the first quarter of 1969, earnings continued to grow
steadily at high rates in nonmanufacturing industries. Continuance
of a very tight labor market and rapidly rising consumer prices
have sustained strong upward pressures on wages and salaries in
these sectors.

II -32
Industrial relations. A number of major contracts involving
workers in paper, retail food chains and airlines have.resulted in set-
tlements generally providing first-year wage increases of 6 per cent
or more. The settlements reached so far, however, have involved only
part of the workers covered by contract expirations in these industries.
In the Pacific Coast pulp and paper industry the settlements
reached covered fewer than 1,000 of 45,000 workers. The two-year Crown
Zellerbach contract provides for a 6 per cent immediate wage increase,
6-1/4 per cent the second year and 6-1/2 per cent the third year. In
the rest of the industry, negotiations were continuing on a mill-by-mill
basis for 44 mills. The companies have refused to negotiate a uniform
contract because of union demands for local bargaining on some issues.
Further progress has been made toward contract settlements
with the 8 major airlines and the transport and mechanic unions. Pan-Am
has settled with the transport workers and Eastern with the machinists;
27,000 workers in all are involved. The terms of the agreement have
not been revealed until ratification by the union membership which is
expected to take place in the near future. The earlier settlement with
American, which provided for an average annual wage increase of 8-1/2
per cent, may have set the pattern for the Pan-Am and Eastern contracts.
Almost 23,000 out of 45,000 retail clerks bargaining with the
Food Employers Council of Southern California have reached agreement on
a new three-year contract providing for a 20-cent increase each year of
the contract; the first-year increase amounts to 6 per cent for an
experienced clerk.

II -33
The nature of the industries involved in negotiations in the
current quarter suggests that there could be considerable strike activity
in coming months. Negotiations in the construction industry are now under
way and have already led to some strike activity, which usually reaches
a peak in May and June. The expiration of maritime contracts in June
has often resulted in strikes in the past. Large profits in the West
Coast lumber industry could lead to above average union demands for
wage increases and result in some strike activity. In the Southern
lumber industry, three-year agreements involving 2,650 workers reportedly
led to a 6 per cent immediate increase. Nearly 70,000 more lumber workers
await contract negotiations on the West Coast.
Wholesale prices. Wholesale prices of industrial commodities
increased 0.5 per cent in March (confidential until April 25)--0.1 point
more than indicated by the BLS preliminary estimate--to 112.0 per cent
of the 1957-59 average. Further large increases in prices of softwood
lumber and boosts for gasoline and crude petroleum were major factors
in the rise. In addition, there was a wide array of increases for rubber
paper, metals, machinery, furniture, and nonmetallic minerals, although
the over-all diffusion of increases was less than in January and February.
A rise of 0.6 per cent in prices of farm and food products in March was
attributable largely to substantial increases for livestock and fresh
and dried vegetables. The combined effect of the increases in agricultural
and industrial prices was to raise the overall WPI by 0.5 per cent to

II -34
111.7 per cent of the 1957-59 average--3.2 per cent above a year earlier,
and up at an annual rate of 6.2 per cent from the fourth quarter.
Of special interest was a slight decline in prices of soft-
wood plywood between mid-February and mid-March, the first monthly
decrease in nearly a year. Further declines in plywood prices (and for
some types of lumber also) have been reported in the press in recent
weeks, suggesting that perhaps a reversal of the recent sharp upward
trend in these prices is developing. The recent lowering of prices
reportedly reflects buyer resistance to earlier sky-high prices, owing
in part to uncertainty about the outlook for housing, and some favorable
supply developments. Logging operations are expanding with better
weather; movement of lumber by water from the West is increasing as a
result of settlement of the Eastern U.S. dock strike; and Federal
actions are being taken to improve rail freight car supplies, reduce
government purchases, and make more timber available.
Despite the possible turning-point for lumber and plywood
prices, average industrial prices have apparently continued to rise
appreciably since mid-March. Increases have been posted for lead,
copper, aluminum and copper mill products, additional steel mill
products, and some paper and chemical items. Hide prices have shown a
sharp increase as cattle slaughter has been curtailed as a result of
adverse weather conditions in the mid-West at the same time that
foreign demands have strengthened considerably.

II -35
The increase in the industrial price average from December to
March was at an annual rate of 6-1/2 per cent--more than twice as fast
as during the last half of 1968. The sharp rise reflected to a major
degree the continued rise in prices of lumber and plywood and of metals.
As indicated in the table below each of these major groups accounted
for close to a third of the total increase from December to March. The
large contribution of the lumber-plywood rise to the total increase is
especially significant, since this group has a base period weight of only
3.3 per cent in the BLS industrial average. (The metals group has a
weight of almost 18 per cent.)

The Federal Reserve sensitive materials index has been particu-
larly affected by the recent large increases in prices of lumber and
plywood and nonferrous metals. As noted in the last Greenbook the sensi-
tive index in March was at an 18-year high. The table below shows the

commodity groupings for July 1968 and the months from December 1968 to

Consumer prices. The consumer price index rose 0.8 per cent
in March to 125.6 per cent of the 1957-59 average. (Strictly Confiden-
tial until release 11:00 a.m., April 24) This was the largest monthly
increase since February 1951. The rise represented a sharp step-up
from increases in other recent months: 0.4 per cent in February and
0.3 per cent in January. The first quarter average rose at an annual
rate of 4.9 per cent from the fourth quarter, a little more than the
fourth quarter increase of 4.6 per cent and about equal to the 5.0
per cent rate in the third quarter last year.I1968

II -37
Major factors in the March rise were sharp increases in home-
ownership costs (including mortgage interest, taxes, insurance and re-
pair costs) and in prices of used cars, apparel, akd gasoline. These
four items together accounted for about two-thirds of the month's total
increase.
The recent upsurge in homeownership costs, which began in
February and appears to be continuing in April, is similar to the burst
last summer when mortgage interest charges in particular also rose sharply.
Largely because of this development, the service component of the CPI
rose at an annual rate of 7.3 per cent in the first quarter of this
year, equal to the rise in the third quarter 1968 and well above the
5 to 5-1/2 per cent rate prevailing during the remainder of 1968.
Mortgage interest charges and home taxes and insurance are not directly
represented in the GNP implicit deflator for consumer services, and the
latter was increasing at an annual rate of less than 5 per cent in late
1968 and early 1969.
In both March and February the increase in the CPI was also
augmented by sharp advances in prices of used cars (6.1 per cent in
February and 6.4 per cent in March). Apart from questions about the
accuracy of this price series, gross sales prices of used cars do not
enter into the GNP estimates of durable consumption expenditures and
their implicit deflator. The rise in used car prices accounted for
roughly half of the sharp increase in the CPI durable commodity component
in February and March. After excluding used cars, average prices of

II -38
durable commodities rose less from the fourth to the first quarter than
from the third to fourth quarter of 1968.
The March increase in prices of nondurable commodities was
sizable, with foods up contraseasonally, apparel up more than seasonally
and gasoline prices rising sharply. After allowance for seasonal
changes, however, average prices of nondurable commodities appear to
have increased somewhat less in the first than in the fourth quarter.
Among services, in addition to the sharp step-up in homeowner-
ship costs, charges for medical care continued to rise at the accelerated
pace of the preceding 2 months (an annual rate of nearly 11 per cent,
compared with 7.3 per cent during 1968). Costs of transportation
services also showed a sizable increase.
Farm exports. Exports of agricultural commodities were rela-
tively stable during 1968 after falling sharply in 1967 from the peak
reached in 1966 when world food supplies were short. Volume of com-
modities exported in 1968 was actually a little larger than in 1967
but average prices were 3 per cent lower, as shown in the table. Sharply
increased shipments of corn, soybeans, oil cake and meal, and moderately
larger volume of rice, animal products, and tobacco more than offset
declines in wheat, vegetable oils, cotton, and fresh and processed
fruits. Prices of oilseeds and products and all the major grains
except rice drifted lower during 1968 under pressure of increasing
supplies throughout the world. About one-fourth of the value of exports
in 1968 was government-financed, the same proportion as a year earlier.

II -39
Undoubtedly, farm exports during 1969 will continue to feel
the effects of foreign competition and growing agricultural protection-
ism that characterized the past year. Value of exports will do well
to reach $6.0 billion, about 4 per cent below calendar 1968. Much will
depend on how harvests in competitive areas turn out in the second
half of the year. Export stoppages at the Atlantic and Gulf ports have
already dampened prospects. In January and February, volume was down
60 per cent from a year earlier and losses in farm export business are
estimated to have amounted to about $300 million.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL SITUATION
Bank credit. After declining at an annual rate of about 2
per cent over the first quarter, bank credit--as measured by the daily
average credit proxy adjusted to include Euro-dollar borrowings--is
projected to rise somewhat in April in response to increases in both
private and U.S. Government demand deposits at banks early in the month.
Total loans and investments at weekly reporting banks--indicated by the
chart on the following page--also rose sharply in early April. This
increase was associated mainly with the recent Treasury financing,
reflecting in large part bank acquisitions of U.S. Government securities
and a sizable increase in dealer loans as these securities were sold out
to dealers. However, further advances in business loans and moderate
bank takings of other securities also contributed to the early April
rise.
During the first quarter, weekly reporting banks liquidated
over $4.5 billion in holdings of U.S. Government securities--about two-
thirds of which were Treasury bills--in order to accommodate loan
demands during this period of heavy CD attrition. Banks increased
substantially their holdings of bills in the first week of April, however,
as they underwrote nearly all of the $1.8 billion Treasury bill strip
with full tax and loan credit. But in the following week, sales of
bills by banks outside New York City were quite large, although bill
holdings of New York banks remained virtually unchanged.

Weekly reporting banks also reduced their holdings of other
securities over the first quarter, particularly both long- and short-
term municipals, although liquidation of participation certificates
and agency issues also were sizable. However, holdings of short-term
municipals did rise in early April, probably reflecting acquisitions
of a large New York State issue of tax warrants on April 8. Holdings
of municipal issues at banks in the New York District usually show a
marked rise in early April followed by sizable declines in the ensuing
weeks.
Total loans outstanding at large banks, which appeared to
decline, on balance, from around mid-February through the end of March,
rose sharply in early April. In large part this recent surge reflects
a substantial rise in broker-dealer loans, although business loans also
displayed a sizable increase in early April. Expansion of real estate
loans seems to have moderated slightly from the advanced pace of recent
months while growth in consumer instalment loans picked up from the
reduced pace of the first quarter.
The increase in business loans during early April--as in the
past 6 months--took place primarily at banks outside New York. More-
over, the increase in business loans since year end, like that in the
fourth quarter of 1968, reflected in large part borrowing by services
and construction firms, although wholesale trade conerns, machinery
producers and petroleum refiners also have borrowed substantially at
banks so far this year.

III -4
Business borrowing at New York City banks during the April
tax week was about in line with that in the past two years even though
tax payments were estimated about $1 billion higher than in those years.
Probably because of the present high cost and reduced availability of
bank loans, corporations apparently relied more heavily on other sources
to meet current tax liabilities, including the liquidation of finance
company paper and Treasury bills--even though the volume of maturing tax
bills was significantly less than in other recent years. The run-off
of CD's at New York banks during the tax week was also comparable to
that in other recent years, in spite of increased tax liabilities, prob-
ably due to the relatively small volume of maturing issues.
At nonweekly reporting banks, total loans and investments
have risen somewhat less than usual since year-end, due to large liqui-
dations of holdings of U.S. Government securities. However, loan
expansion at these banks has been unusually large, and may reflect in
part purchases of loans and loan participations from city banks where
most of the CD attrition has taken place. Acquisitions of other
securities at nonweekly reporting banks also have been well above those
in comparable periods of other recent years.
Bank deposits. Total time and savings deposits at large
banks continued to decline during the first two weeks in April,
reflecting further CD attrition and outflows of consumer-type time and
savings deposits, although both were less than in the comparable period
of 1968 when market yields also were very high relative to Regulation Q
ceilings.

Outstanding CD's at weekly reporting banks fell by an
additional $300 million during the first two weeks in April, with
New York and Chicago banks losing another $285 million in the week
ending April 16, bringing the total decline in CD's from December 11 to
over $6 billion. The volume of CD's maturing in April is comparable to
that in February and March, and attrition so far in April is proceeding
at about the pace prevailing in those months. With this continued
pressure, banks with foreign branches reduced their Euro-dollar

III -6
borrowings during the first two weeks in April by only about one-third
of the amounts in comparable periods in other recent years. And in
the following week, head office liabilities to foreign branches rose
substantially--resulting in an increase in outstandings of about $90
million for the first three weeks in April combined--to a level in
excess of $10 billion.
While net inflows of consumer-type time and savings deposits
at large banks accelerated substantially in March, growth in outstand-
ings over the first quarter as a whole was far below that of comparable
periods in other recent years because of large outflows shortly after
year-end. There was a further outflow of these deposits in early
April--following the quarterly interest-crediting period--but the
decline was somewhat less than during that period last year, largely
due to continued sizable inflows of time certificates and open accounts.
Regular savings deposit outflows were about the same as in early April
of 1968. However, data for New York banks for the week ending April 16
show a decline in consumer-type deposits of 2 to 3 times the usual
amount, reflecting sizable withdrawals of both regular savings deposits
and time certificates and open accounts presumably for payment of
personal income taxes. Outflows of savings deposits at country banks
in early April were also somewhat larger than usual, although expansion
of other time deposits--and consequently total time and savings deposits
at these banks--was well sustained.
With interest rates high and credit availability reduced,
businesses and individuals were under increased pressure to economize

III -7
on their holdings of cash balances over the first quarter. The money
stock rose at only slightly more than a 2 per cent annual rate in the
first quarter, or about one-third the rate of growth in the previous
quarter. The money stock is expected to increase more rapidly, on
balance, in April, largely in response to a sharp and probably temporary
one-week increase in demand deposits around the Easter holiday. U.S.
Government deposits are also expected to increase further in April,
after showing a moderate rise during the first quarter.
Nonbank depositary intermediaries. Savings growth at nonbank
depositary institutions during the first quarter of 1969 averaged a
fairly modest 6 per cent, similar to the pace of all of last year but
somewhat below the fourth quarter of 1968.

The experience during the recently-concluded reinvestment
period was generally similar to that of last year, but appears to have
been the result of dissimilar forces. Although market yields were much
higher than in the same period of 1968, as shown in the table above, it
appears that savers remaining at the thrift institutions are consider-
ably less interest sensitive than earlier. There is evidence, however,
that in the current reinvestment period and the week immediately follow-
ing, need for funds for income tax payments produced accumulated outflows
that may reduce the growth of savings for the month of April. As shown
in the table below, New York savings banks incurred unusually heavy
withdrawals from April 8 to 15--reportedly concentrated on the 14th and
15th. In addition to the general insufficiency of 1968 Federal income
tax withholding, California does not withhold at all for its (now
substantial) state income tax. As a result, California S&L's accounted
for an increased share of reinvestment period outflows, and reportedly
incurred unusually heavy withdrawals on April 14 and 15. Their situation
was reported to have reversed itself on April 16 and 17, however, when
net flows dwindled to near zero or small inflows.

Despite the apparent lack of response of recent savings
patterns to further increases in market yields, the latest development
in the corporate bond market--the very successful marketing of new
corporate issues with only a 5 year maturity--may have an impact on a
segment of depositary claims. These securities may be better substitutes
for deposits than longer-term bonds, and offer a higher yield than short-
term bills which generally are the instruments most comparable to
intermediary claims. The impact may be greatest at West Coast savings196

and loan associations, which generally are restricted to a minimum
3-year term on their special bonus accounts.1/
Savings and loan liquidity ratios during March were basically
unchanged from February. During March, borrowings increased by less
than $50 million in contrast to modest repayments typical for the month.
Similarly, through the first half of April there were indications that
FHLB advances were running only slightly larger than last year. As in
the previous two months, commitments were large relative to cash flows.

Mortgage market. Bolstered by continued, although moderate,
net savings inflows to thrift institutions strong support from other
types of lenders, and substantial commitment backlogs, the mortgage
market entered the spring building season with considerable momentum.
Indeed, during the first quarter, total net mortgage lending increased
slightly above the previous high reached in the fourth quarter, accord-
ing to tentative estimates shown in the table. The record first-quarter
rate of net debt expansion--about 12 per cent above a year earlier when
average real estate prices and loan amounts were lower--reflected a
further rise in growth of residential mortgage debt. That, in turn,
helped to finance the highest quarterly rate of private housing starts
in 5 years, along with an advanced level of existing-house transactions.

The record rate of total net mortgage debt expansion during
the first quarter was apparently buoyed by further large net lending by
commercial banks, but nearly all major private lenders recorded some
year-over-year gains. FNMA holdings rose sharply, with heavy future

III -12
support from this source assured by FNMA's increased build-up of new
commitment approvals. During February, for example, FNMA approved more
new mortgage commitments on residential properties than either all
New York State savings banks or all life insurance companies appear to
have done.
As the second quarter began, some mortgage lenders were
reportedly waiting on the sidelines to assess their savings flow exper-
ience through the income tax payment deadline. Even so, average
secondary-market yields on Federally-underwritten mortgages remained
close to their late-March levels and then edged down slightly after mid-
April, according to the FNMA weekly auction results which partly reflect
a decline in demand for FNMA commitments relative to the increased supply.

Meanwhile, FNMA field reports and other sources have again
stressed the strength of shelter demand in most areas, despite high
mortgage interest rates on new loans, somewhat restrictive discounts on
FHA and VA mortgages, and substantial downpayments associated with con-
ventional first mortgages. Under these conditions, buyers of existing
houses have apparently continued wherever possible to assume lower-rate
mortgages already outstanding on such dwellings rather than finance
their purchases with new first mortgages.
Corporate and municipal bond markets. Despite a sharp
increase in offerings in April, yields on corporate and municipal bonds
have declined substantially from the peaks reached late in March. At
mid-April, yields on new corporate bonds were more than 50 basis points
below their earlier highs and municipal bond yields were down about 15
basis points. Even at lower yields new issues in both markets generally
received an enthusiastic respone from investors.

The hallmark of bond markets since March has been a notice-
able shift in the expectations of market participants to the view that
bond yields might have already reached their highs. While the increases
in the discount rate and reserve requirements announced early in April
appear to have been partly discounted, when coupled with peace rumors
and revised 1970 Budget estimates showing a larger surplus than earlier,
the monetary policy actions evoked interpretations that stabilization
policies would, in fact, adequately restrain excessive economic activity.
(This attitude apparently was reinforced by the President's tax proposals
asking for removal of the investment tax credit.) While these factorsGrde(ixdaultis

III -15
contributed to increased investor demand, the relatively light dealer
inventories also tended to spur aggressive bidding. In addition,
speculators reportedly were beginning to appear and some dealers--
particularly in the municipal market--were said to be building inven-
tory in the hopes of sales at higher prices in the future. The recent
increase in bank loans to dealers on non-Treasury securities may reflect,
in part, the activity of municipal dealers.
The smaller decline in municipal yields must be interpreted
in light of the continued limited bank interest and the surprisingly
large increase in new issue volume. The probable volume of State and
local government bond issues in April has changed dramatically over the
last two weeks, with offerings likely to aggregate nearly $1.6 billion
this month, three times that of March and the largest monthly volume
since October 1968.
Improved market conditions account for nearly all of the rise
in bond offerings. With the decline in yield--and lifting of statutory
ceiling rates in several states--postponements of issues dropped pre-
cipitously from the March level and are estimated at only about $100
million for the month. Furthermore, $250 million of issues postponed
or canceled earlier in the year were successfully reoffered in the first
half of April and several have been rescheduled for the latter part of
the month. Finally, some issues have been added to the calendar with

ments.

only two or three days notice, indicative of borrowers on the sideline
waiting for an improvement in the market to float their bonds; many of
these had not even previously advertised since rate ceilings would not
have permitted their sale at the market yields prevailing earlier.

e/ Estimated.
1/ Data are for principal amounts of new issues.
The volume of tax-exempt offerings estimated for May--at
$900 million--is substantially below April. However, this estimate is
highly tentative and assumes continued constraint on bank purchases and
some rise in yields which will produce an increase in the pace of post-
ponements and make dealers reluctant to acquire much larger inventories.
But a continuation of the trend toward raising statutory ceiling rates
should act to somewhat dampen the impact of an increase in market rates.
The return of previously postponed issues has also been
evident in the corporate bond market. A $75 million utility offering

III -17
indefinitely postponed in March was offered in April, and a $100 million
finance company issue similarly postponed is now scheduled to be offered
this week, both with a maturity of only five years. The success of the
first issue--reportedly purchased primarily by individuals, mutual funds,
and mutual savings banks--has generated interest in intermediate term
maturities and, in addition to the finance offering noted above, other
such issues are now planned. Public bond offerings for April, including
issues previously postponed, are now estimated at $1.2 billion, fifty
per cent larger than in March. As in the first quarter, only a small
proportion of the total is made up of large non-convertible industrial
offerings. Total bond and stock offerings in April are likely to aggre-
gate about $2.3 billion, above the average pace during the first quarter.

With business financing needs likely to remain high, corporate
security issues in May will probably remain large, although somewhat
below the advanced April volume. Public bond issues now scheduled amount
to $600 million and will likely build up to $1 billion. While most of
the issues on the calendar are utilities, a significant volume of con-
vertible bonds by small to medium size firms has been added recently.
Stock offerings are expected to remain substantial, as new issues filed
with the SEC continue large, with a substantial backlog awaiting SEC
clearance.
Stock market. Stock prices since late March have generally
fluctuated in very narrow band, but have been particularly sensitive to
announced changes in public policies. The market declined sharply in
the first trading days after the increase in the discount rate and
reserve requirements in early April, and again early this week after
the details were announced of the Administration's fiscal program.
After each of these declines, however, prices recovered rapidly. Over
a broader time horizon, stock prices are still 7 to 10 per cent below
their December highs and 4 to 9 per cent below their February peaks.
High quality stocks have shown the smallest decline, but their prices
had risen less than those of low quality stocks during 1968.

Trading volume declined significantly further in March. As
a result, member firms of the New York Stock Exchange--despite some
technical difficulties associated with the computerized Central Certif-
icate Service--were again able to reduce the volume of stocks remaining
undelivered after the normal settlement date; these "fails" were the
lowest in the one-year history of the series. Some modest pick up in
volume in the most recent weeks, however, may tend to limit further
reductions in "fails" in April.
With lower trading volume apparently tending to reduce the
profits of some brokers, there was an attempt to increase the trading
day next month from the reduced four hours to a still less than normal

III -20
four and one half hours. However, with some pressure from the SEC, and
with continued difficulties with the Central Certificate Service, an
industry committee has recommended the continuance of the four hours
trading day for the "immediate future."

Margin customers have apparently continued to liquidate
stocks. Very preliminary indications suggest that margin debt extended
by broker/dealers on the New York Stock Exchange declined again in
March, this time by $80 million, and margin credit extended by large
banks also declined by about $40 million. Even though security credit
extended by banks to other than brokers and dealers, a statistic that
includes more than just stock market credit, has generally increased in

III -21
the last 9 months, total stock market credit (from brokers and banks)
is estimated to have declined by 7 per cent since mid-1968; in the same
period margin credit extended by brokers has dropped 15 per cent.
Policy loans at life insurance companies. In line with usual
seasonal patterns, policy loan activity at life companies increased
during March. The amount involved (not seasonally adjusted) was large;
only in August, September and October 1966 did the increases exceed the
current pace. A further increase in April would be seasonally typical.

1/ These companies account for nearly two-thirds of industry policy
loans.
The volume of policy loan activity during the first quarter
(approximately $260 million) had been fully anticipated by the industry;
as far back as the third quarter of 1968, life companies' cash flow
projections for the first quarter allowed for policy loan drains of this
magnitude. The accuracy of these projections, coupled with the general
caution employed in scheduling commitment disbursements relative to

III -22
expected loanable funds, suggests that these loans have not disrupted
planned investment activity.
Reports indicate that policy loans this year, unlike 1966,
consist primarily of small loans taken out by individuals. Many com-
panies that had been relatively unaffected during 1966--companies with
a concentration of small, individual policies--now are reporting con-
siderable increases in policy loans.
U.S. Government securities market.- After an initial increase
of only 8 basis points immediately following the System's April 3
announcement of increases in the Discount Rate and reserve requirements,
yields on Treasury bills due within six months moved irregularly higher
and are now roughly 10 to 40 basis points above their April 1 levels.
Yields on the longest bill maturities, however, as well as on intermed-
iate and long-term coupon issues declined on balance following the
System's action, reflecting expectations of an easing in inflationary
pressures and of some progress towards peace in Vietnam. The Adminis-
tration's most recent fiscal request, for repeal of the investment tax
credit, has been generally interpreted as further confirmation that
anti-inflation policy will become increasingly effective.

Following the end of the quarter, the market supply of short-
term bills expanded somewhat, and dealer positions in such issues rose
accordingly (see table on Dealer Positions, below). Banks sold off a
sizable portion of their awards of "strip" bills which had been held
over the quarter-end for balance sheet and Cook County tax-date posi-
tioning, and corporations and other liquidated bills in order to meet
mid-month tax liabilities. In addition, a fair amount of foreign account
selling of bills in connection with reversal of quarterly window-dressing
flows augmented supplies; and tightness in the money market sharply
increased the penalty cost of carrying dealer positions.
On the other side of the market, seasonal demands for bills
from public funds, as well as demands from corporations experiencing
unexpected cash flows, did allow dealers to move a considerable volume

III -24
of bills, so that yield increases remained quite moderate. After the
mid-month tax date, bill rates moved down from their highs as funds
released through the pay-off of maturing tax bills began to be rein-
vested and market participants looked ahead to potential demands for
bills on swaps out of "rights" to the Treasury's May refunding.
Anticipation of the Treasury refinancing is also reflected
in the dealer position data on coupon issues. Holdings of issues due
within one year have expanded significantly, presumably reflecting
acquisitions of "rights"; whereas short-positions in intermediate-term
issues most likely to be affected by any debt lengthening in the financ-
ing, have deepened.

the majority have left rates at the levels prevailing earlier in the

Federal finance. The Administration's recent budget review
has raised the estimate of Federal cash outlays in fiscal 1969 to
$184.9 billion, $1.2 billion more than was indicated in the January
Budget Document. While no official revision has yet been made in the
estimate of Federal receipts for fiscal 1969, the Board staff is pro-
jecting them at $187.3 billion, $1.2 billion higher than estimated in
the January document. This estimate assumes that neither the surtax
extension nor the new Administration tax reform proposals will be
enacted soon enough to affect receipts in the current fiscal year.
When the staff projection is combined with the Administration's new
expenditure total, it provides a fiscal year surplus of $2.4 billion,
the same as in the January document.

1/ Assumes Johnson budget figure.
2/ Assumes Nixon budget figure.
The Administration's upward adjustment of outlays reflects
larger CCC price support payments, higher interest costs, lower royal-
ties from offshore oil drilling, and the effect of prior commitments on
highway outlays. While these spending adjustments agree substantially
with staff expectations, any further deviations from estimates are also

III -27
likely to be upward. For example, to meet present budget estimates
the Farmers' Home Administration must still make net sales to the public
of another $500 million of its loans by the end of June. Credit market
conditions and the small size of individual loans are likely to make
this goal very difficult to achieve.
The higher staff estimate of fiscal 1969 receipts reflects
larger corporate profits and a generally stronger economy than was
anticipated by the Johnson budget team. But the accuracy of the staff
forecast will be strongly affected by the results of the April tax
inflow. Thus far in April the inflow has fallen a little short of
projections. Since the largest receipts of the year occur in the
current two-week period, and receipts in June will also be very large,
the fiscal year estimate must still be considered as quite tentative.
Looking ahead to fiscal 1970, the Administration's recent
review raised the January budget estimate of outlays by $1.6 billion to
allow for unforeseen contingencies. From this higher figure, it then
cut $4.0 billion to reflect planned program changes, reducing total
anticipated outlays to $192.9 billion as shown in the table.

Lacking a new projection of receipts, the Administration
review combines the estimate from the January budget with its new
expenditure projection and comes up with an anticipated fiscal 1970
surplus of $5.8 billion. While no revised Board staff estimate is yet
available for the full fiscal year either, for the calendar year (1969)
the staff is now projecting a unified budget surplus of $5.2 billion.
This estimate assumes extension of the surtax and repeal of the invest-
ment tax credit as requested. For the balance of calendar 1969, however,
the tax credit repeal may add only a few hundred million dollars to
Treasury cash receipts, since corporations have a large backlog of
accumulated tax credits that can be carried over and used in the period
after repeal. Moreover, the preponderance of equipment orders made
after repeal will probably not be completed, with equipment in operation,
until at least 1970. Hence much of the equipment put in place during
calendar 1969 will still be eligible for tax credits.1/ On a national
income accounts basis, the staff projection shows the Federal sector
surplus dropping from $8.4 billion in the second quarter, to $4.1
billion in the third quarter, and then rising to $5.8 billion in the
fourth.
The unusually large upsurge of tax receipts anticipated
during the remaining weeks of the current fiscal year will permit the
Treasury to redeem the $8.8 billion of maturing tax anticipation bills

will be carried in the Greenbook Supplement.

that fall due in April and June, and still maintai a large average
cash balance over the period. To reduce the size of this balance some-
what, the Treasury has announced that it will redeem, rather than roll-
over, the $200 million added to the monthly April bill maturity by the
late February bill-strip financing. No announcement has been made
whether similar redemptions will be made when the other four monthly
bills involved in the February strip financing reach maturity. Nor is
it clear whether the Treasury plans to redeem any of the $300 million
increments added (by the late March bill-strip financing) to each of
the six weekly bills maturing between May 8 and June 12.
On April 30 the Treasury is expected to announce plans for
refinancing $4.3 billion of notes that mature May 15, $3.8 billion of
which are held by the public. It may also indicate at that time what
its plans are for refinancing $2.5 billion of bonds that mature June 15,
$2.1 billion of which are held by the public. If the Treasury should
elect to refinance these two issues with a single "rights" exchange, as
it did when similar issues fell due last November and December, cash
redemptions in the operation might amount to about $1.5 billion. If
the Treasury then elected to redeem only the strip additions to monthly
bills--total debt repayment in the second quarter would amount to $11
billion and, according to the staff estimate, would still leave a cash
balance of about $7.8 billion at the end of the fiscal year.
This sizable end-of-June balance would permit the Treasury
to defer cash financing in the new fiscal year until late July. For the
full July-December period, the staff projects an essentially seasonal

III -30
deficit of $7.5 billion (unified budget), substantially below the
previous two years.

U.S. balance of payments. The over-all balance measured on
the liquidity basis has continued in heavy deficit. For the first
quarter, the deficit totalled $1.3 billion before seasonal adjustment,
and about $1-3/4 billion seasonally adjusted. For April, through the
16th, there was a further large deficit of roughly $1/2 billion.
The merchandise trade balance registered a large deficit in
the first quarter, but should swing into a substantial surplus in the
second quarter as the backlog of exports is worked off. However, the
effect on the over-all deficit of this shift will depend on relative
lags in payments for imports and receipts for exports. There are some
grounds for thinking that the Lags tend to be greater for exports.
Thus export receipts may continue for a time to be adversely affected
by the very low level of shipments in January and February while import
payments may be at a peak in April and May.
Among the various kinds of capital movements, some showed
sizable inflows in the first quarter but on a diminishing scale. The
inflow of foreign capital to purchase equity securities in the U.S.
market apparently continued into March, but the very partial reports
available suggest that the rate of inflow was reduced from the very

IV -2
high $300 million a month average of January-February. For the first
quarter as a whole the inflow may have matched the fourth-quarter
record of three-quarters of a billion dollars. Bank-reported claims
on foreigners appear to have increased by roughly $75 million in
March--based on very incomplete reporting. There was an outflow of
similar size in February, after an inflow of $400 million in January.
For the quarter as a whole, with a small allowance for seasonality,
it appears that there was a net inflow on the order of $200 million.
U.S. corporations probably raised their first-quarter outflows
for direct investment substantially above the $700 million quarterly
average of last year. Sizable outflows to replenish the working capital
of foreign affiliates were probably necessary after the large withdrawals
at the end of last year. In addition, there were some acquisitions of
foreign firms--though perhaps not an unusual amount--and somewhat higher
payments of taxes and royalties by petroleum companies for account of
their foreign affiliates. Such payments are also scheduled to continue
relatively large in the second quarter.
U.S. corporations apparently increased their short-term assets
abroad by about $150 million in January and February. But as this was
nearly equal to the proceeds of net offshore sales of securities,
there does not seem to have been a large outflow of U.S. funds directly
to the Euro-dollar market by these corporations.
Borrowing abroad by U.S. corporations slowed down considerably
after February, and the first-quarter total of new issues by U.S.-based

IV -3
financial subsidiaries is estimated at $250 million, about half the
quarterly rate in 1968. Meanwhile, sales by foreign-incorporated
financing affiliates were higher than they had been in 1968; they
totalled about $200 million in the first quarter, though they were
apparently negligible after February.
New issues of foreign bonds in the U.S. market were over
$1/2 billion in the first quarter, above last year's quarterly average
and probably above the average to be expected this year. The issues
included about $350 million for Canada and $115 million for the World
Bank. The IBRD invested most of the proceeds from these issues, as
well as about $90 million derived from the sale of a new issue abroad,
in nonliquid issues of U.S. Government Agencies.
To sum up, the first-quarter deficit was enlarged by the
strike-induced trade deficit (though "leads and lags" may postpone
some of the adverse effects to the second quarter), and probably
also by corporate capital outflows and purchases of new foreign bonds.
On the other hand, the very sizable foreign purchases of U.S. equity
securities and the net reduction in banking claims on foreigners
served to keep the deficit from being even larger than it was.
The balance as measured by official reserve transactions
was a surplus of $1.4 billion (not seasonally adjusted) in January-
February. In March the surplus on this basis was probably under
$300 million. Adjusted for seasonality, the surplus for the quarter
may have reached about $1 billion. The major factor producing this

IV -4
surplus was, of course, the huge increase in U.S. liabilities to
commercial banks abroad. Including an estimate for March, this
increase may have exceeded $3 billion for the quarter--nearly as
much as the $3.4 billion for all of 1968. Liabilities to foreign
branches accounted for most of these inflows; they increased by about
$2.5 billion in the first quarter this year and $2.3 billion during
1968. The rise this year would have been even larger if not for the
transfer of $250 million of domestic loans from head office to branch
books--which has the effect of reducing head office liabilities to
branches. (Total short-term liabilities to commercial banks abroad
will not have been affected by this transfer, since the loans in
question will now be reported as foreign banks' claims on U.S. borrowers
"held in custody" at U.S. banks.)
One aspect of the financing of the over-all balance this
year, and also in 1968, has been a reduction in U.S. liabilities to
foreign monetary authorities. In the first half of last year they
were reduced by $2.4 billion. They increased by $1.7 billion in the
second half of 1968, and then in January-February this year were
reduced by $1.6 billion. Much of this reduction has been focussed
on the EEC countries, whose official reserve claims on the United
States at the end of February were $2.9 billion smaller than at the
beginning of 1968. Only a few countries have increased their official
claims on the United States since the end of 1967--notably Canada and
Japan.

IV -5
Special transactions with foreign governments that affect
the liquidity balance have been very much smaller than in 1968.
In the first quarter of 1969 the only large receipt was the quarterly
$125 million military offset from German; other transactions were
negative on balance so that the total of these transactions with
foreign governments for the quarter was a net receipt of only $24
million. The World Bank acquired over $200 million of nonliquid
assets during the quarter.
A somewhat better perspective on recent over-all results in
the balance of payments can be obtained by reviewing the trends in
the liquidity balance before special transactions with foreign
governments. On that basis (in terms of seasonally adjusted annual
rates) the first half of 1968 registered a deficit of $4 billion;
the second half of 1968 deficit rate was $1.3 billion; and the rate
for the half year since the end of September 1968 was probably on the
order of $3-1/2 billion.
Merchandise trade. The effects of the dock strike on our
trade balance--adverse at first and subsequently favorable when exports
catch up--may be greater and more extended than previously anticipated.
In the first quarter (including an estimate for March), the trade
deficit may have been $2-1/2 billion at an annual rate (balance of
payments basis). The strike ended at most ports between February 15
and 28; West Gulf ports, however, did not reopen until the first part of
April. The unusually long time required to clear import cargoes away
from piers and port areas limited exports in February, March and early
April, whereas imports by March may already have been above "normal".

IV -6
The congestion in the New York customs area was so great that the
railroads reimposed a "selective embargo" on shipments to that port
on April 3. The greater weight of exports than of imports at the
West Gulf ports--8 per cent versus 3 per cent respectively--contributed
to the first-quarter trade deficit.
It is estimated that as a result of the dock strike the trade
balance in the first quarter was about $3 billion (annual rate) less
favorable than it would otherwise have been. In the second quarter the
balance should be correspondingly better than "normal". In fact, because
exports were already adversely affected in the latter part of December
1968, whereas December imports were swollen in anticipation of the
strike, the catching-up process should push the trade balance considerably
more than $3 billion (annual rate) above normal. These timing distortions
are making it very difficult to assess the underlying trends of either
exports or imports.
The Euro-dollar market. Euro-dollar interest rates have not
changed much in the past four weeks. Three- and six-month deposits are
now bid at about 8-3/8 per cent per annum, compared with an average
level in late March of 8-1/2 per cent; one-year deposit rates have been
virtually unchanged during the past four weeks at about 8-3/8 per cent.
One-month rates dropped as low as 7-5/8 per cent in mid-April, but have
averaged about 8-3/16 per cent over the past four weeks. Call deposit
rates ranged between 7-7/16 and 8-1/16 per cent and are now near the
high end of that range.

IV -7
Liabilities of U.S. banks to their foreign branches declined
very sharply in the last few days of March (falling by more than $1.0
billion between March 26 and 31) but have increased steadily during the
past three weeks--more than offsetting the quarter-end decline. The
total of such liabilities was $9.75 billion as of April 16, compared to
$9.66 billion on March 26. During the last two weeks of March one
bank sold off $256 million of domestic loan participations to a foreign
branch; the total of such participations has not changed since that time.
The initial tendency for Euro-dollar rates to ease after quarter-
end pressures passed has apparently been offset by a continuation of
rather large takings of funds by American banks and some further
tightening in European money markets. The Bundesbank's announcement of
a full percentage point discount rate increase (to 4 per cent) on April 17
increased the probability that German banks will not significantly increase
their net claims in the Euro-dollar market in coming months. The
Bundesbank has done no new swap business with the market since mid-March
and Bundesbank swaps outstanding have now run down to about $1/2 billion,
compared to about $1.1 billion outstanding as of the end of March. During
the second week of April the Netherlands Bank raised its discount rate
by 1/2 per cent to 5-1/2 per cent, as did the Belgian National Bank.
The Belgian authorities are requiring Belgian banks to adjust their net
foreign position and return some funds on balance, though the amount of
funds involved is relatively small.

Foreign exchange market developments. During the first three
weeks of April foreign exchange markets were relatively steady.
Demand for sterling was firm and the Bank of England was able to pur-
chase about $200 million in the market, while allowing the sterling
rate to move to a recent peak of $2.3970. The Bundesbank sold about $430
million in the market, but in the same period maturing swaps amounted
to $700 million. The French franc continued under persistent
selling pressure and the Bank of France gave up about $340 million.
The Swiss franc rate dropped sharply at the beginning of the month,
reflecting the lifting of end-of-month liquidity pressures on Swiss
commercial banks. On the other hand, the Italian lira began to show
strength following announcement of regulations requiring Italian
commercial banks to repatriate foreign currency assets, and by April 21
it had reached par.

IV -9
On April 22 a generally speculative atmosphere returned to
exchange markets. Growing concern that De Gaulle's referendum might
be defeated in next Sunday's vote increased doubts about the viability
of the present franc parity. Selling pressure increased against the
French franc and soon spread to the pound. The Bank of England lost
$55 million on April 22 and 23 and the Bank of France $40 million.
Demand for the mark increased sharply as talk of a mark revaluation
revived, and the Bundesbank purchased about $200 million in the market
during the same period.
The price of gold in European markets moved in a range bet-
ween $43.00 and $43.40 an ounce during the first three weeks of April,
not much changed from March.

IV -10
Economic activity in industrial countries. Economic
activity expanded rapidly in most major industrial countries during
the fourth quarter of 1968 and maintained a strong, if less dramatic,
pace of expansion in the opening months of 1969. The unusually sharp
advance of activity in OECD Europe in the fourth quarter--in the
entire latter half of 1968, in fact--was influenced by effects of the
May disturbances in France and by Germany's institution of border tax
measures after the November currency crisis. These events had the
effect of concentrating in the second half of last year industrial
production that otherwise might have occurred earlier (in the second
quarter of 1968) or later (in the first quarter of 1969). As a result,
OECD Europe's industrial output rose at a seasonally adjusted annual
rate of 14 per cent from the first half to the second half of 1968, in
comparison with rates of 4 per cent in the preceding period and of 6 per
cent between the two halves of 1967.
In the first few months of 1969 underlying demand trends have
remained strong and are continuing to strengthen in most countries. A
major exception is the United Kingdom, where there have been recent
indications of a leveling off or decline in activity in response to earlier
policy actions. In Japan, there was a pause near the end of 1968 in the
previously very rapid advance in economic activity.
An important feature of the current demand situation in many of
the major industrial countries is the increasing importance of internal
demand relative to external demand as a leading expansionary force. This

IV -11
development can be observed in Germany, France, the Netherlands, Belgium,
Canada, and less clearly in Sweden. In 1967 and early 1968, import demand
in the United States and Britain, and later in Germany, had provided a
major stimulus to economic activity in other industrial countries, at a
time when their own internal demand was depressed or expanding only slowly.
Foreign demand has continued to expand. By the beginning of this year,
however, the stimulus originally provided by exports--in tandem with
expansionary government policies in many cases--had worked its way
through the economies to generate rapidly increasing private internal
demand.
The United Kingdom, Italy and Japan have been exceptions to
the general acceleration of private internal demand. Domestic demand in
Italy remained relatively sluggish until late last year. The Italian
authorities are continuing to take stimulative measures; to hold
down Italian interest rates, they have taken action to restrict and reverse
the outflow of funds to the Euro-dollar market. In Japan internal demand
has recently showed some signs of advancing more slowly, after rising
strongly for some time. The U.K. government has had some success in
curbing domestic demand in an effort to promote exports, and policy
continues to be directed at this objective. However, Britain's export
performance in the first quarter was disappointing.
In a numbers of countries the rapid growth in output and the
continuing strong flows of orders have led authorities to introduce
restrictive measures to damp down reappearing inflationary pressures.

IV -12
The German authorities announced some measures in March and April, the
most recent of which was a full percentage point increase in the discount
rate to 4 per cent effective April 18. Since the beginning of the year,
discount rates have been raised also by the United Kingdom, Canada, the
Netherlands, Belgium, Sweden and Denmark. For two of the smaller
countries, Belgium and Denmark, recent discount actions were largely a
reaction to rising interest levels abroad and were taken to protect
official foreign exchange reserves. In the other instances this motive
contributed to the discount rate actions, but a desire to curb demand
pressure provided an equally important reason for the increase in most
cases.

Business activity in Germany continued to advance at a strong
pace in the first quarter of this year. Announcement of the border tax
measures had caused a bulge in exports and a sharp burst of activity in
November and December. A temporary slowdown had been expected to follow,
but this has been milder than anticipated. Industrial production in
January-February rose further by 3 per cent (at a quarterly rate) after
advancing 4-1/2 per cent from the third to the fourth quarter. Capacity
utilization in industry remained at the very high rate of 88 per cent in
January, rather than seasonally retreating a few points between October
and January, and currently appears to be only slightly below the high
level reached at the peak of the 1963-1965 boom. The labor market has also
tightened significantly. Registered job vacancies in March were as high
as at the end of 1965 and three times as large as the number of unemployed.
Domestic labor continues to be supplemented through the employment of
foreigners. The number of foreign workers employed in Germany is expanding
again and, at 1.1 million, is now at first-half-of-1965 levels, although
not yet at the peak reached before the 1966 downturn.
Order inflows from both domestic and foreign sources are
continuing to show substantial growth. New industrial orders rose at
seasonally adjusted quarterly rates of 6 and 5-1/2 per cent in the last
two quarters of 1968 and rose a further 7-1/2 per cent (at a quarterly
rate) in January-February. Orders for capital goods have risen particularly
vigorously; private fixed capital investment will provide a major stimulus

IV -14
to expansion this year. Consumer demand is expected to gain increasing
strength over the course of the year.
Given the strong demand situation, the narrowing capacity
margins, and recent wage settlements somewhat higher than authorities
would like to see, the German authorities have recently taken a number of
steps in the direction of demand restriction. Following modest government
and central bank measures in March, which were reported in the previous
Greenbook, the Bundesbank took further action on April 18 and raised its
discount rate by a full percentage point to 4 per cent.
The Bundesbank stated that it did not believe that long-term
capital exports would be impaired in any major way by this action, because
the further upward movement of rates in most other major financial centers
over the previous few weeks had widened the differentials between German
and (higher) foreign interest rates.
In the United Kingdom policy remains restrictive and directed
toward curbing personal consumption in order to encourage a transfer of
resources into the export sector and into capital investment. On April 15,
the Labour Government presented a restrictive budget for the fiscal year
that began April 1. The budget surplus in fiscal
1970 is scheduled to be somewhat more than £800 million, by comparison
with last year's surplus of £281 million. The surplus planned for 1970
is therefore £520 million greater than in 1969, an important change but
not nearly as big as the swing of £1.6 billion (from large deficit to

IV -15
a surplus) achieved in 1969, Most of the increase in revenue
is to come from higher taxes on business and from an increase in the
selective employment tax.
Recent data provide some indication--far from clear-cut--that
economic activity in Britain has leveled off in recent months and may even
have declined. Seasonally adjusted industrial production, which was on
an uptrend during 1968, fell sharply from December to January and remained
lower in February. Seasonally adjusted unemployment was steady from
December through March after falling during August-December. Retail
sales (roughly half of total consumer expenditures) in January-February
were substantially below the fourth-quarter average, but in December, consumers
had rushed to buy goods in retail stocks which were not affected by the
end-of-November increase in purchase taxes. The amount of installment
credit extended, after rising from spring 1968 through October, dropped
steadily from October through February.
Bank lending has been slow to respond to government policy.
Therefore, in a major move to force the clearing banks to reduce loans to
the private sector, as previously directed, to 98 per cent of the November
1967 level, the Bank of England raised its discount rate on February 27
to 8 per cent. The resulting automatic increase in bank lending rates
should ease the credit rationing task of the clearing banks. Loans
did fall a little from February to March after rising steadily from
November.

IV -16
According to official estimates, the outlook for the remainder
of 1969 is for moderate real GNP growth at a rate of about 3 per cent.
It is hoped that exports and capital spending by business will provide
the principal expansionary forces.
The current business situation in France and the outlook for
the remainder of the year continue to be heavily influenced by speculative
unease regarding the present parity of the franc. (See page IV -9.)
Following the recovery in the third quarter from the May-June
strikes, economic activity in France expanded very sharply during the
last quarter of 1958. Activity was stimulated by the strong growth of
private domestic and foreign demand, a large budget deficit, and the
psychological effect of the expansionary budget for 1969 announced in
September (since then revised and made much less expansionary than originally
planned). Industrial production rose 7 per cent from the third to the
fourth quarter, and then advanced further by about 1 per cent (quarterly
rate) in January-February.
Overall demand is high and is continuing to expand strongly,
especially on the domestic side. Capacity limitations have begun to
appear. Recent surveys indicate that industry has been operating near
or at capacity in a few sectors during recent months. Further expansion
of production is hampered also by shortages of skilled labor, although
unemployment remains at a relatively high level.

IV -17
In marked contrast to the first half of last year when exports
provided the major growth stimulus, activity since last autumn has been
led by consumer demand, strengthened by the large 1968 wage increases
and rising employment and accentuated by a lack of confidence in the
parity of the franc and in future price stability. The demand for consumer
durables has risen well above normal and capacity limitations are being
felt particularly in this sector. Partly for this reason, imports remain
uncomfortably high.
Continuing official reserve losses, unavoidable in the face of
the persistent current account deficit and the lack of confidence in
the franc, may force the authorities to restrict domestic demand further.
So far this year, however, wage and price increases--critical elements in
the effort to maintain the exchange rate--have been no larger than expected.
Special factors account for most of the price increase in January-February.
The few wage increases negotiated this year have been within the 6 per cent
limit considered tolerable. However, there is no certainty that similarly
successful country-wide agreements will be achieved in the large number
of contracts which must still be negotiated before the June deadline,
In contrast to the situation in most other industrial countries,
the objective of authorities in Italy continues to be the encouragement
of a more rapid growth of domestic demand. There is some evidence,
although far from conclusive, that the pace of activity may have
accelerated in the closing months of 1968. In September-October, the
index of industrial production rose sharply to a level 6 per cent above

IV -18
the average of the first six months. Strikes and bad weather caused
production to fall in November but by January it seems to have regained
the October level. Further evidence of expanding demand is provided by
imports, which have risen quite sharply since August. Labor market
indicators lag considerably, but recent surveys indicate some acceleration
in the rate of growth of employment in manufacturing and no further year-
to-year increase in unemployment.
Exports have continued to be the most dynamic sector of the
economy and their advance continued to be very rapid into January. However,
domestic expenditures on equipment accelerated somewhat in the fourth
quarter and construction activity rose sharply.
Conditions exist under which GNP growth could accelerate in
future months. A large increase in pensions will boost consumer spending,
and the construction outlook is buoyant. Investment expenditures in
general will be helped by the monetary authorities' determination to
prevent a rise in interest rates. To this end, Italian commercial banks
have been requested to reduce and, by the end of June, to balance their
net foreign asset positions.
Another measure which may make it easier for Italian companies
to raise equity capital, was announced early in April: banks and other
credit institutions are prohibited from underwriting or guaranteeing
securities issued outside Italy, with a few exceptions. Presumably,
this will reduce the flow of non-bank capital into Euro-bonds and may
divert funds to the Italian stock market.

IV -19
In the Netherlands, strongly rising internal demand and
continuing high foreign demand have led to a rapid growth of output
and to renewed tightness in the labor market. Industrial production
accelerated from a seasonally-adjusted quarterly increase of about 3 per
cent in the third quarter to over 3-1/2 per cent in the fourth quarter of
1968. Increasing pressure on resources has contributed, along with the
introduction of the value-added tax system in January, to a sharp price
rise. Consumer prices rose 5-1/2 per cent between mid-December and
mid-March. Since December the authorities have announced a number of
counter-inflationary measures including the reimposition of bank credit
ceilings, a general price freeze and an increase in the central bank's
discount rate (in two steps) to 5-1/2 per cent.
In Sweden, the quickening economic pace already discernible
a few months ago has continued, stimulated by foreign demand and recently
also by accelerating domestic demand. Domestic car sales have improved
noticeably. Seasonally adjusted unemployment fell in the fourth quarter
of 1968 and the beginning of 1969 after rising since mid-1966. Fixed
capital investment (excluding housing) is expected to increase by about
5 per cent in 1969, following a prolonged period of relative stagnation.
The Swedish discount rate increase in February was motivated
primarily by a desire to reduce losses in foreign exchange reserves.
Since then measures have been taken with the aim of restraining the growth
of domestic demand. These include the imposition of a 2 per cent cash

IV -20
reserve requirement for commercial banks, higher bank liquidity ratios,
and tighter rules on commercial bank borrowing from the central
bank.
The expansion of economic activity in Belgium continued in
the fourth quarter of 1968, with indications that it became more broadly
based. Export demand was very strong, and inventory accumulation provided
another expansionary force. Expenditures for plant and equipment and
for housing began to increase again late in the year, and consumer expendi-
tures rose somewhat more rapidly than earlier.
The Belgian discount rate has been raised three times since
December, by a total of 1-3/4 percentage points, to 5-1/2 per cent.
Although the central bank has explained these actions as partly motivated
by rising credit demands, the main objective was apparently to slow the
outflow of funds to the Euro-dollar market from Belgium.
In Canada scattered data available for 1969 indicate that
restrictive policies have had little effect on the pace of economic
activity so far. Industrial production, after rising almost 3 per cent
from the third to the fourth quarter, changed little in January-February.
Manufactures' new orders in the four months ending in January were
2.6 per cent above those of the preceding four months. Housing starts
(seasonally adjusted) were up 14 per cent from the fourth to the first
quarter.

IV -21
Current expectations are that Canadian GNP in 1969 will approach
the 1968 rate of grouth--8.5 per cent nominal, 4.7 per cent real--with
little slowing before late in the year. The growth in GNP is expected
to be fairly evenly balanced among expenditure categories, with fixed
investment expenditures compensating for the expected slowing of export
growth.
The Bank of Canada raised its discount rate from 6-1/2 to 7 per
cent on March 3. On April 11 it announced an increase in banks' secondary
reserve ratios from 7 to 8 per cent, effective June. This step is
designed to reduce the ability of the banks to expand business loans by
running off their liquid assets.
In Japan there was a pause at the year end in the growth of
economic activity. After rising vigorously since the spring of 1968--to
a level about 65 per cent higher than at the end of 1965--industrial
production fell 1-1/2 per cent in December. In January-February there
was a partial recovery. Renewed advances on the Tokyo stock market and
increases in wholesale and retail prices suggest that demands in the
Japanese economy are still strong.
The recent pause was associated with a slowing of new orders for
machinery, after very rapid earlier advances. Private consumer demand
appears to continue strong. As a result of sharp increases in personal
disposable income, consumption expenditures are expected (by a leading
research center) to be about 15 per cent greater in the 1969-70 fiscal

IV -22
year (April to March) than in 1968-69. This would be about the same
rate of rise as for the year just ended. Inventory investment is
expected to continue substantial. Japan's over-all GNP is expected
to increase about 12 per cent in real terms as compared to 15 per cent
from 1967-68 to 1968-69.
Commercial bank lending rates tended to ease slightly through
February. The authorities have announced that banks will be permitted to
repay some of their short-term foreign debts in view of present interest
rate relationships between the United States and Japan.

APPENDIX A: RECENT STATE AND LOCAL BOND POSTPONEMENTS AND EXPENDITURE
IMPACTS *
Since December 1 of last year, postponements and abandonments
of State and local long-term bond issues reported in the financial
press have amounted to $1.1 billion. The first half of April brought
a sharp reversal in both the level of new postponements and in new
offerings as several governmental units reacted to improved market
conditions and revised interest rate limitations. Nevertheless, if
allowance is made for additional issues which did not reach the stage
of advertising for bids, it is quite likely that the total amount of
State and local borrowing postponed during this period approached
$2.0 billion, the bulk of which has not yet been reoffered.
On the basis of numerous reports gathered from a recent
telephone survey of State and local fiscal officers and advisors, the
consequences of these financing difficulties for expenditures should be
more severe than those found in the 1966 State and local borrowing
survey. It is estimated that recent shortfalls in long-term borrowing
eventually will generate $400 to $600 million in construction spending
delays and cutbacks. At current levels, this implies that 2 to 4 per
cent of scheduled State and local government construction expenditure
is being canceled or at least retarded. The final dollar magnitude of
projects affected--and the duration of these cutbacks and deferrals--
depends principally on the future course of interest rates and on
changes in legal interest rate ceilings.
By far the leading immediate cause of recent borrowing post-
ponements has been the existence in most states of interest rate ceilings.
While at the present time, several of these limitations are being raised
or suspended, a search of recent bond advertisements indicated that
44 states had ceilings on the maximum allowable net interest cost generally
ranging from 5 to 6 per cent. With the Bond Buyer Index hovering between
5.15 and 5.30 per cent for investment-grade, seasoned, 20-year general
obligation bonds, it recently has been impossible for all except short-
term, high-grade issues to go to market in those states with ceilings.
A secondary cause of postponements--but one of declining importance
given the inflationary expectations of many finance offices--is voluntary
speculation on the part of prospective borrowers that long-term rates
will decline.
Wherever possible, borrowers attempt to tailor their issues
to meet the demand of the market; but for lower or nonrated communities
with one-shot, long-term projects to fund, extensive size and maturity
adjustments are not practical. Moreover, because of various limitations

on short-term borrowing in several states, many smaller borrowers
have been effectively frozen out of the credit market altogether,
Total spending impacts of borrowing shortfalls are extremely
difficult to gauge since they are seldom reported and lag well behind
changes in borrowing plans and, hence, will depend ultimately in large
part on future developments. All reports indicate, however, that
spending effects will be more severe than those experienced in 1966
when each dollar of borrowing delay or cutback generated approximately
15 to 20 cents in expenditures temporarily or permanently curtailed.
Although estimates vary greatly from region to region, the general
impression is that for the smaller units construction project deferrals
are running at roughly twice the rate they were in 1966 or roughly
50 cents on the dollar of long-term borrowing delayed or abandoned. But
with many states in the process of revising both short- and long-term
borrowing restrictions, both the volume of postponements and the induced
expenditure effects should moderate, unless market conditions deteriorate
sharply.
Large governmental units, while also bumping into interest
rate ceilings, are generally more successful in buffering current
expenditure plans from disruptions in long-term borrowing plans. So
far most large units are succeeding either in getting interest rate
limitations raised or removed, as in the case of certain State of
California authorities and municipalities in New York, or in borrowing
short-term, as in the case of the Illinois Building Authority. However,
there is evidence that many units have been cutting back on planned
expenditures more severely than they did in 1966, especially in the area
of revenue-supported projects.
Overall, it appears that unless the market for long-term funds
improves very radically in the near term and allows a extremely rapid
makeup of postponed offerings, ultimate spending impacts should range
from 20 to 30 per cent of the total borrowing short-fall which has
occurred since last December. With an estimated $2.0 billion in such
abandonments and delays over the past 4-1/2 months, this would amount
to $400 to $600 million in spending reductions and postponements
stretching throughout this year and into 1970. Continued stringency in
the capital markets and additional postponements during the remainder
of 1969, of course, would swell this figure to a larger total for the
year as a whole.
