SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK
Outlook for economic activity
Recent data suggest that economic expansion is continuing to
moderate but price pressures remain extremely strong. We have revised
our projected second quarter increase in GNP downward by about $1.5
billion to $14 billion and real GNP growth is now expected to grow a
little more slowly than projected earlier, rising at an annual rate of
2.2 per cent this quarter compared with 2.8 per cent in the first
quarter.
Signs of some easing have appeared in growth of employment,
output, and incomes in April. The rise in construction activity has
slowed and housing starts have declined considerably in recent months.
Retail sales through mid-May continued to lack buoyancy; there has
been little gain in real takings since last fall. In addition, revised
estimates are for a much smaller post-strike rebound in net exports
this quarter than previously expected,
With expansion in real output moderating, credit quite tight,
and growth in total profits slowing, businessmen's attitudes toward
new investment may be in process of changing somewhat, At recent
meetings of business economists, forecasts of new plant and equipment
spending in 1969 have been typically in the 10-11 per cent range,
rather than the 14 per cent indicated in the February Commerce-SEC
survey. There also had been a leveling in domestic new orders for
machinery and equipment, prior to the probably temporary April upsurge

I-2
related to prior rumors of imminent repeal of the investment tax credit.
Consequently, discounting this April surge, we are continuing to project
relatively little further increase in capital spending for the remainder
of this year from the sharply advanced first quarter rate.
In the second half of the year, reduced rates of expansion
in employment and personal income are expected to hold growth in con-
sumption to moderate rates, even though the ending of retroactive tax pay-
ments and the scheduled Federal pay increase will tend to increase growth
in disposable income in the third quarter. It appears likely that
Federal spending (aside from the pay raise) will continue under sub-
stantial restraint; construction activity will turn downward; and,
as indicated above, business fixed investment outlays will show a
sharply reduced rate of growth. On balance, the probabilities are that
real economic expansion will slow further, perhaps to about a 1-1/2 per
cent rate in the second half of the year. It seems unlikely, however,
that the rise in the GNP deflator can be reduced to less than a 3-1/2
per cent annual rate before year end, compared to 4.3 per cent in the
first quarter.
Outlook for resource use and prices
If our GNP projections are realized, the rate of increase in
industrial production in this and remaining quarters of this year is
likely to slow significantly from the pace of the past two quarters.
Growth in industrial output already slackened in April to an annual
rate of 3.5 per cent, from about 6 per cent in the first quarter.

I-3
After the extraordinary rise in employment in recent months,
the small gain in April was not unexpected. Furthermore, prospective
slackening in growth of aggregate demand suggests only moderate gains
from now on. With reduced availability of new jobs, the labor force
may also expand less rapidly than it has recently, so that unemploy-
ment is likely to rise only gradually from the April rate of 3.5 per
cent.
The increase in compensation per manhour slowed to an annual
rate of about 6-1/2 per cent in the first quarter with fewer new settle-
ments; however, little further trimming in the rise in wages is likely
this year. Unit labor costs in manufacturing may have risen at about a
4 per cent annual rate in the first quarter, but manufacturing cor-
porations were able to raise prices sufficiently to raise slightly
their profit margins. Further rapid increases in unit labor costs
are likely to persist in the months ahead, but in the less ebullient
markets projected, it should prove increasingly difficult for businesses
to pass on rising costs in the form of higher prices.
Consumer prices in April rose nearly as sharply as in March.
The rise in service prices may taper off in May, if, as expected, the
climb in mortgage rates peaks out. But meat prices seem likely to
continue to rise, possibly until midyear, when improved supplies of
pork and poultry are in prospect.
Wholesale prices of industrial commodities rose much less
rapidly in April than in the first quarter, due mainly to sharp

I-4
declines in prices of lumber and plywood. For other commodities, the
picture of widespread and rapid price increases was nearly the same as
in other recent months. Strong foreign demand and high levels of dom-
estic business investment and residential construction have contributed
significantly to rising material and machinery prices but slackening
demand pressures in these domestic sectors are in train.
Outlook for credit demands
Credit demands are likely to remain relatively strong in
late spring and early summer, although current high yield levels are
leading to some postponements in bond markets, particularly municipal
issues. Such postponements, as they continue, may take some of the
edge off of upward interest rate pressures, which are being generated
in part by expectations of a prime loan rate rise, by continuing very
tight money market conditions, and by a dampening of near-term peace
hopes in Vietnam.
It appears likely that long-term interest rates may rise
further over the near-term. Corporate need for external funds is ex-
pected to remain large, and municipal and mortgage markets are strongly
constrained by continuing limitations on the supply of funds. But
while bond markets are going through a short-run upward interest rate
adjustment, it is not clear that longer-run expectations of a tapering
off in interest rate pressures as the year progresses have altered
significantly. So long as such expectations are maintained--and this
depends in part on the continued prospect for some slowing in economic
expansion--the current upward interest rate adjustment may be limited.

I -5
Corporate borrowing in the bond market may remain close to
its recent pace, on the assumption that businesses do not anticipate
a significant further tightening of monetary policy and thus are not
disposed to push ahead on long-term financing needs at current interest
rate levels. In light of the rise in market rates realtive to bank
loan rates, and expectations of lower long-term rates later in the year,
corporations are expected to continue drawing heavily on bank lines
and from other short-term sources over the period ahead. Business
needs for credit in June will be dominated by the $9-1/2 billion or so
of income taxes that corporations are expected to pay at that time--a
much larger total than in any previous year except 1967.
The municipal market is currently under considerable pressure
and yields have reached new record levels. These pressures have re-
flected continued small bank demand and the overhang of dealers'
positions built up earlier when expectations of declining interest
rates were more prevalent. The forthcoming volume of offerings is
likely to remain moderate as the pace of cancellations and postpone-
ments increases in face of limited bank interest and dealer caution.
Bond market yields may also be under upward pressure over the short-run
if Government security dealers continue to make efforts to dispose of
the remaining overhang of the new 7 year Treasury note offered in the
mid-May refunding.

I-6
Outlook for bank deposits and other sources of funds
Barring a sizable decline in short-term yields, particularly
on Treasury bills, total time and savings deposits at commercial banks
are expected to show relatively little net growth over the next few
weeks. CD maturities and expected attrition will be seasonally large
in June in light of corporate needs for funds for tax payments. More-
over, net inflows of consumer-type time and savings deposits may be a
relatively limited source of funds to banks. The decline in such
deposits in April undoubtedly was associated with large retroactive
payments of individual income taxes at midmonth, and the turn-around
after the tax date has been moderate. With respect to demand deposits,
maintenance of high interest rates and the restricted availability of
funds should keep growth rates of cash balances to modest proportions
in the months ahead.
With deposits constrained, while credit demands continue
relatively strong, other financing arrangements of banks could expand
sharply over the next couple of months. A major avenue for such
financing that appears likely to surge is the issuance of commercial
paper by bank holding companies and their affiliates. An increase in
such borrowings in the order of $1/2 to $1 billion over the next few
months could well develop. This may enable some banks to postpone
adjustments in their portfolio of longer-term securities while at the
same time exerting upward rate pressures in short-term markets.

I-7
Following the April reinvestment and tax period, inflows to
nonbank savings institutions are likely to return to around the first
quarter pace, at least until the July reinvestment period. But with
outstanding commitments high and the prospects for July reinvestment
experience uncertain, new commitment volume is likely to moderate.
With mortgage demands continuing strong, mortgage rates particularly
for conventional loans, are likely to rise into the summer.
Balance of payments outlook
A massive outflow of corporate and other U.S. private capital
during the recent period of intense speculation on a revaluation of
the German mark has added a strange new patch to the craxy-quilt pattern
of the U.S. balance of payments this year. In the first quarter, U.S.
merchandise trade showed a deficit, and the December corporate capital
inflow reversed itself, but foreign purchases of U.S. equities were at
a record level and the inflow of liquid funds to the United States
through banks abroad exceeded $3 billion. The overall balance was in
heavy deficit on the liquidity basis, but on the official settlements
basis there was an unprecedentedly large surplus.
During the first half of May, the outflow of nonbank capital
into marks greatly enlarged the U.S. balance of payments deficit (under
any definition). The official settlements balance was adversely affect-
ed also by a run down of short-term U.S. bank liabilities to branches
abroad, as Euro-dollar depositors and borrowers withdrew funds to
purchase marks. Liabilities of U.S. banks to their foreign branches
dropped by more than $1 billion in 20 days after April 23.

I -8
After May 13, however, these liabilities to branches started
to rise again. Prediction would be rash, but it would not be sur-
prising to see the inflow continue, so long as U.S. banks prefer to
pay high short-term interest rates rather than take large losses in
liquidating investments--at least until the next rush to marks squeezes
the Euro-dollar market again.
Recent interagency group projections of the U.S. balance of
payments foresee no improvement this year as compared with 1968 in the
goods and services account and some worsening in the long-term capital
account. However, until recovery from the port strike is farther
advanced useful evidence on the trade position will remain scanty, and,
of course, projections of the capital accounts--both short- and long-
term--are more than ever suspect under the present conditions of un-
certainty in exchange markets.

THE ECONOMIC PICTURE IN DETAIL
The Nonfinancial Scene
Gross national product. Recent data appear to confirm the
trend toward slowing real growth in the economy. Employment and
income gains were distinctly smaller in April than during the winter,
and recent estimates of retail sales have shown erratic monthly move-
ments with little growth since last fall in real takings. Housing
starts have declined for the third successive month, and construction
activity has begun to grow more slowly. New orders for machinery and
equipment had leveled off prior to a sharp but probably temporary
upsurge in April, apparently in anticipation of suspension or repeal of
the investment tax credit; on the whole, however, the recent course of
such orders supports forecasts of slower growth in plant andequipment
spending. Even the post-strike surge in exports, which is expected to
bolster GNP growth this quarter, now seems likely to be much smaller
than earlier anticipated. We are therefore projecting a reduced rate
of growth of GNP this quarter, $14 billion, down from a revised estimate
of $15.9 billion in the first quarter. With price increases continuing
strong, real GNP growth is expected to dip further, to an annual rate
of 2.2 per cent from 2.8 per cent last quarter.
A further slowing in growth appears increasingly likely
during the second half of the year. Tight monetary and credit policy
should soon begin to curtail construction activity; budgetary restric-
tions will probably halt growth of Federal expenditures before year end;

II -2
and only a modest growth in personal income is likely to restrain
increases in consumption expenditures. With costs still rising sub-
stantially and with external financing increasingly costly and hard to
get, businessmen's anticipations should begin to be dampened, leading
to curtailment in the growth of business spending and greater resistance
to wage increases. But strong cost pressures are expected to perist and
only a modest easing in the rate of inflation seems likely in the
remainder of this year.
Although consumption expenditures rebounded in the first
quarter from the weak fourth quarter rate, the recovery in retail sales
so far in 1969 has been uneven, with the level of sales in April only
slightly above that of late last summer despite substantial price
increases. In real terms, retail sales as a whole in March and April
were apparently little or no higher than a year earlier. Domestic auto
sales have declined from the 9 million average rate of last fall,
averaging 8.2 million in both March and April; in early May, however,
sales advanced above this level.
With much slower growth in disposable income, the first
quarter increase in consumer expenditures was associated with a sharp
dip in the saving rate to 6.1 per cent, which is low by recent standards
but about in line with the 1965-66 experience. Except for a prospective
temporary bulge in the third quarter resulting from the Federal govern-
ment pay raise, gains in disposable income are expected to continue
moderate for the remainder of the year. Wage rate increases are likely
to continue relatively large, but average hours are expected to fall

II -3
and employment growth to moderate. With the saving rate already
reduced, consumer spending seems unlikely to show notably stronger
growth than disposable income.
Business spending for plant and equipment has provided the
major underpinning for recent expansion in overall output. The first
quarter showed an unusually large $5.3 billion rise in these expendi-
tures--almost equal to the anticipated increase reported in the February
Commerce-SEC survey. This survey indicated a dip in expenditures in
the second quarter followed by moderate increases in the last half of
the year. However, the momentum of recent increases plus a rise in
manufacturers' unfilled orders for machinery and equipment in the first
quarter suggest that a dip is unlikely and we continue to project a
small increase in the current quarter.
With even a small further rise this quarter, the level of
capital spending would already be some 11 per cent above 1968, and only
modest further gains would be needed in the second half to attain the
14 per cent increase projected in the survey for 1969. Recent meetings
of business economists suggested that a 1969 average increase in
spending of 10-11 per cent is now considered a more reasonable projec-
tion, which would imply no increase in capital spending after this
quarter. We agree that the survey projection for the year may not be
realized, but are continuing to project a small gain of about $1 billion
quarterly in the second half. This would bring the average increase for
the year 1969 to about 12 per cent.

II -4
Private housing starts in April were down to an annual rate
of 1.5 million units, compared with a peak rate of 1.9 million in
January. As a result, residential construction expenditures are
expected to dip by about $1 billion in the current quarter, with rising
costs partly offsetting the expected dip in starts. High interest
rates and an increasing shortage of mortgage funds should work to
reduce new housing activity further in the second half of the year, but
the decline should be relatively moderate. Exceptionally strong under-
lying shelter demands, the marked shift in starts toward multi-family
units, and the surprisingly high level of commitments reported by the
thrift institutions so far this spring suggest that housing starts in
the second half of the year may not drop below 1.4 million units.
The shift from larger to smaller rates of inventory accumula-
tion between the fourth and first quarters was a major factor restraining
GNP growth in the latter period. In the second quarter, we anticipate
stock building will continue at about the same rate as in the first
quarter. Some liquidation of auto stocks and of inventories for export
should serve to moderate possible rapid inventory accumulation in other
sectors. If, as we expect, consumption expenditures continue to show
only modest real growth and orders for business equipment tend to level
off, a more rapid inventory buildup may well develop later on in the
year.
The anticipated rebound in net exports following the long-
shoremen's strike now appears likely to be much smaller than anticipated
earlier, and this is a major factor lowering our projection of the second

II -5
quarter rise in GNP. Revised estimates--based on projections of an
interagency balance of payments group--now indicate a lower level of
exports (including the possible permanent loss of some $400 million in
exports during the strike), and further increases in imports for the
current quarter. As a result, the net export balance for the second
quarter is now projected to be $2.7 billion instead of the $6.0 we had
been projecting earlier. In addition, the estimated net export balance
for the third and fourth quarters has been cut back to $1.7 billion
from the previous estimate of over $3 billion a quarter, largely reflect-
ing growing pessimism on the outlook for exports.
Our projections of Federal spending continue to be consistent
with the downward revised budget outlays of $192.9 billion for fiscal
1970 proposed in the new administration's April budget review (and
repeated in testimony of the Director of the Budget on May 20.) Except
for the pay increase scheduled for July 1, little further rise is
anticipated this year in purchases of goods and services. In fact, as
now budgeted, defense purchases will decline in real terms in the last
three quarters. Recent Congressional determination to fix a ceiling
for 1970 expenditures would also seem to assure a relatively tight
Budget in the coming fiscal year.
The large first quarter Budget surplus probably has played an
important role in slowing the growth in economic activity. The sharp
increase in tax receipts--reflecting mainly higher social security taxes
and retroactive surtax payments--in conjunction with slower growth in
spending produced an estimated surplus in the first quarter at an annual

II -6
rate in excess of $7 billion (NIA basis). This compares with a virtual
balance of receipts and expenditures in the fourth quarter, and had its
counterpart in a reduced rate of expansion in private incomes--especially
in personal disposable income. The first quarter rate of surplus is
expected to be repeated in the current quarter, but subsequently growth
of tax receipts will slow, reflecting completion of retroactive payments
and some easing in activity. Nevertheless, the surplus is projected to
average about $4 billion in the second half, so that a moderate Federal
restrictive impact can be expected to persist for the balance of the
year.

Industrial production. Industrial production in April was
171.5 per cent of the 1957-59 average--up 0.3 per cent from March and
5.5 per cent from a year earlier. Output of business equipment and
some industrial materials rose further, but production of consumer
goods declined.
The February and March levels of the index were each revised
upwards by 0.3 per cent and the revised first quarter average, 170.0
per cent, is 1.5 per cent above the fourth quarter of 1968--a 6.2 per
cent annual rate of increase. If the preliminary April gain is matched
in May and June, the second quarter average would be about 172.0 per
cent and the rate of growth would slow to an annual rate of 4.7 per
cent. The following table indicates the month to month per cent changes
in the total index and its major components from December 1968 to April
1969.

Auto assemblies were at an annual rate of 7.7 million units
in April, down almost one-tenth from March mainly because of strikes at
Chrysler and General Motors. The strike at Chrysler has been settled
but that at General Motors has continued thus far in May, and auto
production this month will most probably not return to the February-
March level of 8.4 million units.
Sales of new domestic autos rose in the first ten days of
May and were about 7 per cent above the 8.2 million unit annual rate of
March-April and 2 per cent above a year earlier. Dealers' stocks
declined somewhat further, but were still 8 per cent above a year earlier.
Among other consumer goods, output of television sets
declined in April and preliminary data for household appliances indicate
little change in production levels since January. Output of furniture,
however, continued to expand. Production of apparel and footwear has
been relatively stable since March 1968 at a level around 140 per cent
of the 1957-59 average. While the value of retail sales of apparel has
increased about 7 per cent over the past year, the BLS consumer price
index for apparel also rose by the same amount. Output of consumer
staples--which includes foods, drugs, medicine, residential electricity,
and some other products--has continued to rise at its long-term growth
rate of about 4 per cent a year.
Production of industrial and commercial equipment increased
further in April and so far in 1969 output has risen at an annual rate
of over 10 per cent. Output of freight and passenger equipment leveled
off in April as a decline in truck assumblies, because of strikes, was

II -11
offset mainly by increased production of commercial aircraft. Output
of farm equipment, which had declined about 25 per cent since December
1966, has been about unchanged since January of this year. Defense
equipment production has recovered from the strike-reduced low in
January, but in April was still 3 per cent below the third quarter 1968
high.
Output of iron and steel increased further in April to within
5 per cent of the pre-labor contract settlement high in 1968. In early
May, production of raw steel was about unchanged. Output of construction
materials and parts for consumer durable goods declined in April. Pro-
duction of textiles and industrial chemicals has changed little since
January and output of paper was apparently unchanged in April.
Capacity utilization. The April rate of manufacturing
capacity utilization is estimated at 84.4 per cent, unchanged from the
first quarter average. While the overall operating rate remains at
moderate levels, there has been some tightening in the materials
producing industries in recent months. Operating rates are high in the
paper, nonferrous metals and rubber products industries, and above
normal in the production of aircraft. Appreciable amounts of unused
capacity are available for most other manufacturing products.

Consumer credit. Consumer instalment credit outstanding rose
at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $7.8 billion in March, a marked
slowing from the February increase of $9.6 billion. Extensions declined
slightly in March as a reduction in personal loans more than offset
small increases in automobile and other consumer goods credit; repayments
were at a record high.
For the first quarter as a whole, the net increase in instal-
ment credit amounted to $8.3 billion, seasonally adjusted annual rate,
as compared with increases of about $10 billion in each of the two
preceding quarters. Smaller gains were reported in most major classi-
fications of consumer credit.

The increase in auto credit during the first quarter was the
smallest since the fourth quarter of 1967 when new car sales were cur-
tailed by strikes at some of the major producers. The recent slowing
reflects a decline in unit sales of new and used cars during early
1969--in part because of the dockworkers' strike that curtailed sales
of imports--that was tempered by larger average size of notes and a
higher proportion of credit sales.
Retail sales. Following the decline in retail sales in the
fourth quarter, the erratic recovery so far in 1969 has brought sales
levels only modestly above those of late last summer. Actually, the
figures for March show almost no change from September 1968, and the
rise in retail sales in April was not very large considering the March
decline. The advance March retail sales estimate was reduced by an
unusually large preliminary revision in the data, changing an increase
in retail sales from February of close to 1 per cent to a decline of
about the same amount.
Retail sales in April increased 1.5 per cent from March,
according to the advance report, as almost all major groups except
automotive recovered all or part of their March declines. The April
recovery brought total sales to a new high, but durable goods sales
remained slightly below the first quarter average. This was entirely
accounted for by the automotive group, with other durable goods sales
in April holding even with the first quarter. Nondurable goods sales
in April were relatively stronger and this category was 1.7 per cent
above the average of the first three months of this year.

CPI.
In real terms, retail sales have been showing progressively
less strength in year-to-year increases for some months. In March,
total sales deflated by the all commodities CPI were 0.6 per cent lower
than in March 1968. It is unlikely that there was any significant gain
in real takings in April, since the dollar amount of sales was only
5.9 per cent above a year earlier, with the bulk of the rise likely to
represent price increases.
Leading indicators. The preliminary Census composite leading
indicator decreased about 1 per cent in March--the first decline that
large since January 1968. In addition, the coincident and lagging
composites barely increased, after more than a year of sustained strength.I

Since the preliminary March composites were compiled, a
number of the leading components have had some upward revision, includ-
ing the manufacturing workweek, housing permits, durable new orders,
and plant and equipment contracts and orders. On the other hand, March
declines are now reported for other components such as net business
formation, changes in consumer instalment debt, and inventory book
value change. Of the components available so far for April, the work-
week is down fractionally and housing permits, stock prices, and the
ratio of price to unit labor costs are up.
Manufacturers orders. New orders for durable goods rose
3.9 per cent in April according to advance figures, following a 2.6 per
cent decline in March. Shipments were little changed and unfilled orders
rose 1.5 per cent. The largest gains in unfilled orders were for iron
and steel and for machinery and equipment.
A huge surge in new orders for railroad equipment resulted in
a rise of 78.5 per cent in orders for transportation equipment excluding
motor vehicles and aircraft. Apart from the transportation equipment

II -16
group, durable goods orders were up 2.4 per cent from March and about
at the February level. April new orders for machinery and equipment--
which includes railroad equipment--rose 9.7 per cent and for iron and
steel, 9.0 per cent. New orders for defense products (new series) were
down 3.2 per cent and for nonferrous metals were down .6 per cent.
The preliminary March new order figures for durables have
been revised down slightly, but the present figures for the first three
months of this year still average nearly 1 per cent (annual rate of
4 per cent) above the fourth quarter of 1968. On the other hand, non-
durable orders averaged 1 per cent (annual rate of 4 per cent) less than
in the fourth quarter. Wholesale price indexes were rising, particularly
for durable manufactures; after allowing for price change, the new orders
data for the first quarter imply declines in real terms at annual rates
of about 3-1/2 per cent for durables and 7-1/2 per cent for nondurables.
As the table indicates, new orders were exceptionally strong in the
fourth quarter, when steel orders were recovering, capital goods orders
were rising sharply, and consumer staples were showing substantial
increases.

Inventories. According to the revised official GNP estimate,
inventories accumulated at a $6.9 billion annual rate in the first
quarter, slightly larger than the preliminary estimate but still well
below the fourth quarter of 1968. Total book values of manufacturing
and trade inventories increased at a somewhat lower rate than in the
fourth quarter while the valuation adjustment for price increase was
particularly large, cutting book value further in its translation to
the GNP concept,

Book value increases were substantial in February and March,
especially at wholesale and at durable manufacturers. But wholesale
sales also jumped in March, and the wholesale inventory-sales ratio
dropped back to the lowest point since last September. These recent
changes in wholesale sales and inventories may, however, reflect mainly
the ending of the dock strike.
Retail inventory accumulation was small in the first quarter;
there was no accumulation in March, but retail sales were down and the
inventory-sales ratio rose, particularly at G.A.F. stores. In April,
retail sales recovered, and stocks of U.S.-made autos declined again as
strikes limited production. For these reasons, continued slow retail
inventory growth and declines in stock-sales ratios seem likely for the
current period.

II -19
The first quarter inventory accumulation was concentrated in
durable goods manufacturing, where book values were rising rapidly and
were creeping up relative to sales and unfilled orders. This build-up
is probably largely "voluntary"; manufacturers of business and defense
equipment, which to a large extent produce to order rather than to
stock, accounted for more than half of the first-quarter increase in
durable manufacturers' inventories. The value of new orders in these
industries has been tending to level off, apart from the April advance,
and may decline in coming months if the proposed suspension of the
investment tax credit and other restraining forces take effect.

The inventory position of the equipment industries appears to
be more extended than in 1966, just before the 1967 inventory readjust-
ment. Although inventory-shipments ratios are not much different from
December 1966 levels, ratios of unfilled orders to shipments are lower.
Inventories are also higher relative to order backlogs, and it seems
possible that declines in backlogs in the equipment industries would be
followed by inventory liquidation, rather than continued build-up as in
1967, and also by greater production declines than in 1967.
Construction and real estate. The seasonally adjusted value
of new construction put in place edged upward further to a new current-
dollar peak of $92.1 billion in April, according to preliminary estimates
by the Census Bureau. While the year-to-year increase amounted to 8 per
cent, all of it reflected higher costs.
Although some slowing in outlays for residential construction
is indicated during the second quarter, in line with the overall down-
trend in starts which began last February, such outlays apparently rose
further in April. However, nonresidential construction activity con-
tinued below the high reached last January, reflecting a leveling off
in outlays for stores, offices and other commercial structures since
then and some reduction in activity on industrial plants. Public con-
struction moved higher, but also remained under its earlier peak.

Seasonally adjusted private housing starts continued downward
in April for the third consecutive month. However, the decline was
associated with a 3 per cent upward revision for March and was to a
still relatively high annual rate of 1.54 million units.
While--as in March--all of the decline in April was concen-
trated in single-family starts, the rise in multifamily starts was
minimal and the rate remained appreciably short of earlier peaks.
Within the individual regions, total starts moved counter to the pre-
vailing downtrend mainly in the West, reflecting further recovery from
a sharp curtailment induced by unusually heavy rains in California last
winter.

1/ Seasonally adjusted annual rates; preliminary.
Seasonally adjusted building permits, which have fluctuated
within a narrow range so far this year, turned upward again in April,
but the overall rise was comparatively slight as an increase for multi-
family structures was largely offset by a further decline for single-
family structures to the lowest rate since last June. Consequently,
staff projections of starts for the remainder of the spring quarter
remain essentially unchanged, with some further easing expected from
the exceptionally high first quarter annual rate which averaged in
excess of 1.7 million units. Even so, with both mortgage commitments
outstanding at thrift institutions and the rate of building permits
still quite high, housing starts for the spring quarter as a whole
should hold close to the advanced 1.5 million rate averaged in the year
1968.

II -23
Apart from the accelerated first quarter pace of starts and
continued tightness in financial markets as a whole, disruptions caused
by competitively low usury ceilings in some states have also been a
factor in the recent downtrend in starts. These difficulties have been
particularly marked in the North Central states which led the rise in
housing starts earlier this year. In addition, high construction costs
and labor and materials shortages appear to have contributed to the
less than seasonal increase this spring. At the same time, however,
consumer interest in available new and existing houses has apparently
continued quite strong. Based on the FRB-FHLBB survey of lenders,
demands for funds to support such purchases were generally running in
excess of available funds in May, as discussed in the special supplement
distributed with the Greenbook.
Census Survey of Consumer Buying Expectations. The April
survey suggests that there has been no change from a year earlier in
the number of new cars consumers expect to purchase, or in the amount
of money which they plan to spend on household durables and houses.
The maintenance of buying plans is somewhat surprising in view of the
sharp drop in the proportion of families reporting actual year-over-year
increases in incomes, and the deterioration in their expectations for
family money income over the next 12-month period.
The index of expected new car purchases in April was unchanged
from the second quarter of 1968 and up about 2 percentage points from
the January 1969 value (not seasonally adjusted). According to the

II -24
Census forecasting equation--which was recently revised--this level of
the index implies household car purchases of domestic and foreign cars
at an annual rate of 7.9 million equal to about 9.3 million for total
sales, including business and government purchases, in the second and
third quarters of this year. (The total sales rate in the first quarter
was 9.3 million.) The index of plans to purchase used cars is down
significantly from a year ago, although--as with the index for new cars-
it is up from the first quarter figure.
The April index of expected expenditures for houses was
almost unchanged from last year. However, there was a rather large
decline in the likelihood that a specific household would buy a house,
and the index of expenditures was sustained by a substantial increase
in the average price expected to be paid for a house.
The index of expected expenditures for household durables was
up from a year earlier and also from January. However, the number of
major items reported likely to be purchased per household within 12
months was down slightly from a year ago and the increase in the index
was mainly attributable to the larger average dollar expenditures antic-
ipated.
The proportion of families reporting income increases in the
last 12 months dropped to 35.9 per cent--the fourth successive quarterly
decline from the 40.9 per cent peak reported in April 1968. The likeli-
hood that a family was expecting an income increase in the next 12 months
was also slightly lower--and the probability of an expected decrease
slightly larger--than a year ago.

In coming months, pressure on wage and salary disbursements
from pay increases seems likely to continue comparatively strong. More
than 2 million unionized workers will receive deferred increases ranging
from 4 to 5 per cent during this quarter and new contracts covering

II -26
about 300,000 construction workers are likely to provide for large
first-year increases. In addition, the Federal civilian and military
pay increase scheduled for early July will add approximately $2.6 billion
(annual rate) to wage and salary disbursements.
Productivity and labor costs. Output per manhour in the
private nonfarm economy declined in the first quarter of 1969 for the
first time since the mini-recession of 1967. In part, the first quarter
drop reflected erratic movements in labor input. However, when the
fourth and first quarter changes are averaged, the growth rate of output
per manhour was still only half as large as during early 1968.
The entire weakening in productivity growth occurred in the
nonmanufacturing sector, where employment rose at an accelerated rate
while output growth slowed further. In manufacturing, output per man-
hour continued to increase as output (based on the Board's unrevised
manufacturing production index) rose more rapidly than employment.
Productivity declines are not unusual when there is a slowing
of growth in the economy because work force adjustments tend to lag
changes in output. This is especially likely to be true in a tight
labor market when employers are reluctant to lay off workers who may
find alternative jobs and not be available for recall when demand
increases again.
The growth rate of hourly compensation slowed somewhat in the
first quarter from the accelerated rate of late 1968. However, the rate
for the nonfarm economy was only a little lower than in 1968 as a whole--

II -27
6.4 per cent compared with more than 7 per cent--and with productivity
down, the annual rate of increase of unit labor costs rose sharply in
the first quarter. (Over the year, unit labor costs were up 4.5 per
cent, compared with an average rise of 4 per cent during 1968.) The
last time unit labor costs rose sharply was during the early 1967
adjustment. At that time, unit labor costs spurted up to an 8.7 per
cent annual rate, then fell back in the next quarter as labor input
flows were adjusted to desired output levels.

Labor market. The labor market showed some indications of
easing in April, with employers possibly reacting to the recent imbalance
between employment growth and demand for output. In the fourth and
first quarters, employment gains had accelerated strongly while total
output growth eased somewhat. This was reflected in a decline of pro-
ductivity in the private nonfarm economy in the first quarter of 1969,
and may have been a factor in the slowing in hiring in April. Thus far,
the easing has not caused layoffs and insured unemployment continued low
through early May. The overall unemployment rate edged up to 3.5 per
cent in April, with the rise occurring mainly among nonwhites, especially
nonwhite women.

II -28
Employment. Nonfarm payroll employment rose by only 34,000
in April compared with 200,000 in March and an average monthly advance
of 320,000 between September 1968 and February 1969. The April rise
was the smallest since January 1968 and reflected the absence of signif-
icant growth in all sectors except finance and State and local government.
Manufacturing employment showed a negligible advance as small
gains in machinery and electrical equipment were offset by declines in
the nondurable-goods group. Since September, virtually all the growth
in manufacturing has been in the capital goods industries, while
employment and hours have held steady or eased slightly in most of the
consumer goods industries. In the defense group, employment has edged
down in aircraft manufacturing and the workweek has dropped sharply in
ordnance.

April also brought the second consecutive monthly decline in
construction employment (down 24,000 seasonally adjusted), due partly
to strikes accompanying the annual round of spring wage bargaining.

II -29
Employment levels in services and trade were little changed over the
month, but such slowdowns are frequently followed by sharp increases in
subsequent months. Over the year, trade and service employment had
risen by nearly 1.2 million and there is no reason to think that the
strong demands for workers in these industries have suddenly abated.
Hours and earnings. Hours of work in private nonfarm indus-
tries were unchanged in April at 37.8 hours, but the average workweek
of production workers in manufacturing declined one-tenth of an hour.
More significantly, overtime in manufacturing was reduced by three-
tenths of an hour, to 3.4 hours, with the bulk of the cutback in durable
goods industries. This is the smallest amount of overtime in a year
and, together with the lack of significant increase in manufacturing
employment, suggests that manufacturers are adjusting labor input
schedules to conform to the slower growth of demand.
Average hourly earnings in manufacturing rose one cent to
$3.14 in April, a rise of 5.7 per cent over a year ago. The increase
from March was at about the same rate as in the first quarter, but in
both periods the increase was somewhat smaller than the large gains of
late 1968. The slower growth of manufacturing hourly earnings in part
reflects the limited number of contract reopenings this year.
Although earnings increases have eased appreciably in manu-
facturing, rapid advances continued in the nonmanufacturing industries,
mainly because of large increases granted in wage decisions affecting
unorganized workers, and large negotiated increases for longshoremen,
airline mechanics, and construction workers.

Labor force and unemployment. The civilian labor force
declined slightly in April and there has been almost no net increase
since February. However, because of the huge gains between September
and February, the labor force was still averaging 1.9-2.0 million above
the level of twelve months ago--about half a million more than "normally"
anticipated from population and participation rate increases.
The unemployment rate edged up to 3.5 per cent in April,
rising a tenth of a point for the second successive month. Jobless
rates were higher in April than in February for both whites and nonwhites
and for most age-sex groups. Although the slight rise in total unem-
ployment was spread widely, the largest increase occurred among nonwhite
adult women, whose rate rose from 5.3 per cent in February to 7.2 per
cent in April. Many such women are in service occupations and the
unemployment rate for service workers also rose sharply.

The rate for blue collar workers also drifted up over the
February-April period, with the bulk of the rise among laborers last
employed in construction and manufacturing. These rates are quite
variable, with minor changes often reflecting differences in weather
conditions, or jobseeking among young men in college or just leaving
the Armed Forces.
The market continued very tight for most other groups.
Unemployment rates for married men and white-collar workers continued
below 2 per cent, while the index of help wanted advertising moved up
to a new high in March (April data not available).

II -32
Collective bargaining. The cost of collective bargaining
settlements during the first quarter of 1969 continued at about the
same high level as in 1968. Approximately three quarters of a million
workers in transportation, service activities, petroleum refining, and
apparel were covered under the early 1969 settlements which provided
median wage and benefit increases of 5.9 per cent annually during the
life of the contract. In 1968, the median annual wage and benefit
increase was 6 per cent.
First quarter negotiations continued to emphasize large
first-year wage boosts and the median first-year wage adjustment was only
slightly less than 6.9 per cent in 1968--compared with 7.2 per cent.
First-year boosts averaged near 10 per cent in several nonmanufacturing
settlements including the airline and longshoremen's contracts, and
several construction settlements.
Over the next several months, collective bargaining will be
dominated by negotiations in the construction industry, where spring-
time bargaining and strikes are common. As of mid-May, about 45,000
construction workers were out on strike and their number is likely to
rise in the next few months. Overall, the upcoming settlements will
cover approximately 300,000 workers in a number of large cities and
large wage and benefit increases are likely.
A continuing strike of approximately 35,000 GM assembly
workers at 7 regional planss has resulted in the layoff of nearly 35,000
parts workers, cutting production and dealer inventories in recent weeks.

II -33
At issue are local wage scales in merged assembly operations. Because
of the high level of auto inventories, the strikehas not appreciably
affected sales and settlements are apparently near. The liquidation
of inventories now taking place seems likely to leave the industry
in a somewhat more favorable inventory position at the end of the model
year than had been expected prior to the strike.
Wholesale prices. The rise in wholesale prices of industrial
commodities slowed to 0.1 per cent (1.1 per cent annual rate) from mid-
March to mid-April, compared to a rate of 6 per cent or more in each of
the months of the first quarter. However, increases in wholesale prices
remained widespread last month, though not so numerous as in January
and February, and only an abrupt reversal in the earlier upward push of
lumber and plywood prices prevented a much larger.increase in the
industrial total. Excluding lumber and plyoood, average industrial
prices increased at an annual rate of 3.5 per cent in April--a high
rate but down from the 4.6 per cent rate between December and March.
Nonferrous metals continued the first quarter rate of rise
of over 20 per cent annually between mid-March and mid-April, with
boosts in the price of lead and in brass and aluminum products. Copper,
molybdenum and zinc prices have since increased. The April industrial
average also reflected important, if less dramatkc, increases in prices
of machinery, pulp, and paper products, gasoline, and hides. More
recently, hide prices have declined.

II -34
Lumber and plywood prices have dropped sharply since late
February, when they reached an all-time high, with the bulk of the
decline in late March and early April. The decline brought quotations
in late April back to the January level for lumber and to the level of
last August for plywood. Improved production of logs and resistance
from buyers, many of whom were holding heavy inventories, were instru-
mental in bringing the price of plywood down, but recent indications
are that the market has firmed. If plywood prices stabilize or again
increase, the special FR sensitive materials index, which declined in
April from an 18-year high in March, is likely to rise again in May.

Prices of livestock and meat advanced further in April,
helping to push the index for farm products and foods up by 0.2 per
cent. Wholesale prices of eggs, fresh vegetables, and poultry declined.
In 1969 thus far, meat supplies, especially pork and poultry,
have exceeded the same period last year by a substantial margin.
Rising livestock prices seem to reflect very heavy consumer demand for
beef, and some geographical maldistribution of supplies. Since mid-
April, livestock prices have risen sharply, as marketings have leveled
off. However, beef supplies are expected to improve modestly in the
second half of the year, and further substantial gains in marketings
of hogs and poultry are anticipated.
Consumer prices. The consumer price index advanced 0.6
per cent in April. (Confidential until 11 a.m., May 22) Although
almost all categories of goods and services rose, two items--food, and
the costs of "insurance and finance" contributed almost half the total
advance in the consumer index.
Meats, poultry, and fish were responsible for much of the
0.7 per cent rise in food prices in April. Despite prospects of
relatively ample supplies, prices of meat, and particularly beef, have
risen strongly this year. Moreover, the rise in wholesale meat prices
of 5 per cent, seasonally adjusted, since January has outstripped the
retail price climb of 2.8 per cent (also adjusted), indicating that
further increases for the consumer price index are likely. However,
a decline in retail prices of fresh fruits and vegetables which have

II -36
already dropped at wholesale, should provide some offset to climbing
food costs in May. In the second half of this year, larger year-over-
year gains in marketings of livestock, mainly hogs and poultry, are
expected, which should moderate the advance in meat prices.
Costs of apparel and household durables increased substantially
in March. New car prices declined and used car prices, which had
increased 13 per cent between January and March, rose little further.
Recently, discounts on new cars have been reported to be increasing.
Service prices in April continued to rise at an annual rate
of almost 10 per cent reaching a level 7 per cent above a year earlier.
Costs of insurance and finance, which includes mortgage interest and
property taxes and insurance, rose 4 per cent between January and April,
but they are expected to rise more slowly in May in response to a
slower rise in mortgage rates. Other service prices--medical care,
utilities, home-maintenance, etc.--are showing little tendency to slow
their advance, while the cost of recreational services went up excep-
tionally fast in April.
The consumer price index and the GNP deflator. As a result
of the very large rise in March, the increase in the consumer price
index accelerated in the first quarter. The rise in the implicit GNP
deflator also showed some pick-up (from an annual rate of 4.1 per
cent in the fourth to 4.3 per cent in the first quarter), but the
implicit deflator for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) showed
substantially less rise in the first than in the fourth quarter. The

II -37
pick-up in the GNP deflator reflected sharp step-ups in the rate of
increase in the cost of both residential and business construction
from an average annual rate of only about 3 per cent in the fourth
quarter.
The marked contrast between the behavior of the CPI and the
deflator for personal consumption expenditures in the first quarter
stems (as was also the case in the third quarter last year) in part
from inclusion of sharply rising mortgage interest charges and property
taxes and insurance in the service component of the CPI. These
specific homeownership costs jumped particularly sharply in March and
contributed to the marked acceleration in the rise in the CPI
service component for the first quarter. In the GNP accounts, housing
"services" of homeowners are measured by imputed rent, and they are
deflated by the slow-moving CPI rent index. Quarterly increases in
the CPI service index with and without "insurance and finance,"
about three-fifths of which represents mortgage interest and property
taxes and insurance, are compared below with the implicit deflator
for consumption expenditures on services:

1/ The published index for "insurance and finance' includes the un-
published series on mortgage interest charges as well as property
taxes and insurance. Together these housing costs account for
about three-fifths of "insurance and finance", which in turn
accounts for almost one-third of Services in the CPI.
Another factor in the first quarter divergence of the CPI
and the GNP consumption deflator was a very sharp increase in the CPI
used car price index, which has shown unusual ups and downs in recent
months. These movements have only minimal influence on the GNP
deflator for autos, since the GNP includes only the mark-up for used
cars as representing the value of current production. After excluding
used car prices and also taking account of seasonal changes--which
are important for both durable and nondurable commodities in the
fourth and first quarters--the CPI durable goods commodity index
showed the same rate of increase in the first quarter as in the
fourth (about 3 per cent, at an annual rate). With used cars in-
cluded, the rise in the CPI durable goods commodity index jumped
sharply in the first quarter, to an annual rate of over 5 per cent.II III IV I

II -39
There remain unexplained differences between the movements
of the CPI and the PCE deflator in the first quarter. These may re-
flect a combination of certain other differences in coverage and in
seasonals and the basic weighting differences between the two measures.
In the third quarter 1968, there was also a large difference between
the two after rough allowance for the major coverage differences
mentioned above, and a significant part of this difference could be
attributed to the basic differences in weighting concepts. See
March 1969 Survey of Current Business.)

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL SITUATION
Flow of Funds, First Quarter, 1969. Flow of funds tabulations
for the first quarter show relatively modest changes in total borrowing
and its composition in comparison with either the fourth quarter of
1968 or the year 1968 as a whole. On the supply side of credit markets,
however, changes in sources of funds were major, reflecting mainly the
cessation of demand deposit growth, the drain of CD balances from banks,
and the conversion of foreign holdings of dollars from Government
securities to Euro-dollar lending to U.S. banks. During the first
quarter banks managed to supply a substantial part of the credit raised
by private borrowers, but only through sizable runoffs in Government
security holdings and security credit.
Total borrowing, at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $91
billion (Table 1), was up $5 billion over the fourth quarter, the net
effect of a $10 billion increase in Government borrowing and a $5
billion decrease in private funds raised. The drop in private credit
flows appeared mainly in State and local government borrowing (line 9),
which retreated somewhat from the very high rates in the second half of
1968, and in consumer credit (in line 6). Business demand for funds
(line 12) continued at the high rates of the fourth quarter, but with

sizable shifts away from direct bank loans and toward commercial paper
issues, which increased by a record amount in the first quarter (in
line 6). Corporate security issues also increased somewhat in the
first quarter but were offset by the decline in municipal offerings (in
line 3). All forms of mortgage borrowing (line 4) continued fairly
stable in the first quarter at about their fourth-quarter rates.
The structure of credit supply, in Table 2, combined two
contrasting developments in the first quarter. The first is the
shift of direct lending entirely away from banks (in line 2) and
away from foreign lenders (line 7), whose supply was dominated by
conversions of dollar holdings into deposits at foreign branches of
U.S. banks. This shift is reflected in the unprecedented estimate
of $60 billion for direct purchases of securities by private domestic

III -3
nonfinancial investors (line 8), an amount that is more than twice
as high as in the earlier peak quarters in 1966. At the same time,
however, and in contrast to bank developments, savings institutions
and other nonbank finance (lines 3 and 4) maintained their net lending
rates at just about the fourth-quarter levels, on the basis of
continuing stable supply of deposit funds to them.

The rise in private direct lending from a $2 billion rate in
the fourth quarter to a $60 billion rate in the first quarter appears
in Table 3 in relation to the corresponding private deposit flows,
which decrease more than enough from the fourth quarter to the first
quarter to finance those security purchases. The shift in time deposit
flows (line 3) from fairly rapid growth into December of last year to
runoff this year accounts for over half of the funds required, and
the cessation of demand deposit growth provided the rest. Throughout
the period onflows to savings institutions (line 4) remained stable,
providing the base for savings institution lending in Table 2.

Of the $60 billion estimate for private direct lending
(line 5), about half was purchases of Governments(line 6) that
offset bank and foreign sales in the Government securities market.
Another $20 billion appears to have gone into municipal and corporate
bonds, partly from State and local retirement funds but with the major
increase appearing in household (and personal trust) buying. Individuals
appear to have supplied virtually all of the funds raised in the
municipal market during the first quarter, and in this respect the
period was similar to the second half of 1966 and in contrast to periods
of easier monetary conditions, when banks frequently buy two-thirds to
four-fifths of the net amounts issued. In the 1966 period, however,
the volume of net municipal issues--and household purchases--were at
about a $5 billion annual rate, whereas during the first quarter of this
year they were close to a $13 billion rate.
Of the total credit raised in the first quarter, banks of
course supplied approximately zero, as against 51 per cent in the
fourth quarter. The largest part of the drop in bank credit flow was
in Government securities, municipals, and security credit, however,
and bank lending to private borrowers fell off only moderately. This
can be seen in Table 4, which compares total private borrowing and
the bank component, omitting State and local borrowing and security
credit from both totals (lines 1 and 2). The first-quarter bank
share (line 4) was down from the fourth quarter, but it was only
slightly below the year averages for 1967 and 1968 and was a little
above 1966.

The fourth-to-first quarter pattern in Table 4 was fairly
similar, although in a shorter time period, to the movements from 1965
to 1966. In both cases there was a decrease in private credit from
banks together with an increase of smaller amount in private borrowing
outside banks, with the two combining to produce a moderate drop in
total private borrowing. The bank actions required this year to
maintain their private credit flow were, however, far more extreme
than in any of the quarter of 1966, with Government security liquida-
tions and Euro-dollar borrowing both over twice as large as in any
quarter of 1966. The effect can be seen in the figures below, where
the ratio of bank loans to total bank credit increased 1-1/2
percentage points over the quarter (still omitting security credit),
as compared with 1-percentage point increases in each of the first two
quarters of 1966.

Sources and uses of corporate funds. The gap between capital
expenditures and internal funds of nonfinancial corporations widened
substantially in late 1968 and early 1969, as outlays for physical
assets rose sharply while the flow of internal funds declined. In
part to fill this widening gap, nonfinancial corporations greatly
increased the volume of funds raised in credit and capital markets.
Such external financing was also large enough to permit a substantial
addition to holdings of liquid assets.
By the first quarter of 1969, capital expenditures of non-
financial corporations exceeded internal funds by a record $24.3 billion,
compared with $20.1 billion in the preceding quarter and around $15
billion earlier in 1968. Financing in credit and equity markets, which
had increased from a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $23 billion in
the first 9 months of 1968 to $36 billion in the fourth quarter, rose
further to nearly $39 billion. Accumulation of liquid assets, however,
was smaller than in 1968 as a whole, though well above the levels of
any other recent year.

III -8
Staff projections of the national income and product accounts
in the second and third quarters of 1969 imply little change from first
quarter levels in either internal funds or capital expenditures. Thus
the spread between the principal use and the major source of corporate
funds is expected to remain at about the record rate reached in the
first quarter. A projected pattern of other uses and sources of
corporate funds in the second and third quarters, associated with these
GNP projections, is presented in the table on the next page. Major
features of this pattern are the continued heavy volume of corporate
financing in credit and capital markets, at a level not much below the
first quarter, and a marked drop-off in accumulation of liquid
assets (net of the change in tax liabilities).
The critical element in the course of corporate financing over
the next few months seems likely to be the influence of expectations
about prospective credit conditions on attitudes of corporations about
their liquidity positions. It is especially difficult, given the
current uncertainty among market participants as to the near-term
course of interest rates, to anticipate the nature of expectational
factors in the third quarter. The financing pattern projected in the
table arbitrarily assumes an expectation that borrowing conditions will
ease reasonably soon after the third quarter. This assumption has
two major implications for Liquid asset management and hence for
corporate external financing.

First, it implies that, in the second and third quarters,
corporations will not borrow significant amounts in advance of current
needs, and will add little to their holdings of liquid assets. The
erosion in liquidity which would result would probably not be acceptable
to corporations except temporarily.
Second, it implies that corporate efforts to husband liquid
assets and to restrain bank borrowing will result in a shift toward non-
cash methods of financing mergers and acquisitions. Most mergers and
acquisitions, of course, are accomplished through exchange of stock
(which has no effect on financial flows for the corporate sector as a
whole), and some have involved exchanging the bonds or convertible
debentures of the acquiring company for the stock of the acquired
company,(which increases the volume of net bond issues and decreases
the volume of net stock issues by the same amount).
But through most of 1968, and in early 1969 as well, a
number of large acquisitions involved payments in cash to the stock-
holders of the acquired company. In the fourth quarter of last year,
cash retirements of this type were at an annual rate of more than $7
billion. This method of financing mergers and acquisitions absorbs
cash assets, and reduces the reported volume of net stock issues with
no net borrowing offset except to the moderate extent that funds used
to retire stock are obtained from banks. The projections shown in
the table assume that use of this method will be declining in the
second and third quarters, but not to pre-1968 proportions.

III -11
A different assumption about expectations would greatly affect
the projected levels of corporate financing. For example, once corpora-
tions become so confident of imminent easing of credit conditions that
they are relatively unconcerned about a temporary substantial erosion
in liquidity, cash retirements of the stock of acquired companies could
become very large again and this, together with temporary additional
postponements of new borrowing, could--if it occurred early in the
third quarter--result in a significantly lower volume of financing
in credit and capital markets in that quarter than is shown in the
table (and a decline, rather than modest increase, in holdings of
liquid assets). On the other hand, expectations that any substantial
easing in credit market conditions would be deferred indefinitely
could activate concern about liquidity positions, with the result
that cash retirements of stock might dwindle to almost nothing, post-
ponement of new borrowing appear fruitless, and the net volume of
external financing thus be considerably larger than projected in the table.
Bank credit. Total loans and investments at all commercial
banks rose by over $3 billion in April, following relatively little
growth over the first quarter. The April increase was concentrated
at weekly reporting banks and reflected bank participation in the most
recent Treasury bill strip, as well as rapid loan expansion associated
in part with financing of April tax payments. This credit expansion
was associated largely with increases in U.S. Government deposits at
banks, which rose by more than $3 billion from the end of March
through the end of April.

Bank holdings of U.S. Government securities rose slightly
in April, in contrast to large declines at both weekly reporting and
nonweekly reporting banks during the first quarter. The April
increase resulted in large part from an increase in bill holdings early
in the month at weekly reporting banks, as they underwrote nearly all
of the $1.8 billion Treasury bill strip with full tax and loan credit.
These banks, however, ran off substantial amounts of bills in subse-
quent weeks, and by the first week in May, their holdings of U.S.
Government securities were below those in late March just prior to the
financing. Nonweekly reporting banks made sizable further reductions
in their holdings of U.S. Government securities during April.

Bank holdings of other securities fell somewhat in April after
having risen only slightly over the first quarter. The seasonally
adjusted decline reflected less than usual increases in holdings of these
securities at both weekly reporting and nonweekly reporting banks--which
for the smaller banks, was in sharp contrast to the sizable amounts of
other securities that they took into portfolio over the first quarter.
Total loans expanded relatively more rapidly in April than in
the first quarter, but much less of this increase was at nonweekly
reporting banks than was the case during the first quarter. Nearly
one-half of the April rise was in loans to businesses, which continued
to increase at about the same rapid 16 per cent annual rate of the
previous six months. Growth in real estate loans, which maintained the
advanced rate of recent months, contributed significantly to the April
increase. Loans to finance companies also rose substantially and may
have reflected some diversion of borrowing from the commercial paper

III- 14
market to banks, as indicated below. Security loans rose only slightly--
in contrast to large declines over the first quarter--presumably in
response to the increase in dealer inventories of securities in April.
Consumer loans, however, continued to expand at the reduced pace
prevailing since year-end.
The continued strength in business loan demand probably
reflects in part financing of inventory accumulation, although a large
part of the April increase represented borrowing to meet mid-month
tax payments. At weekly reporting banks, the increase in business loans
in April and early May was sizable at both New York and outside banks,
in contrast to increases over the previous 6 months which were mainly
at banks outside New York City. The recent increase was also fairly
widespread among industry categories, but loans to a few industries
such as services, construction, and public utilities--which were
large during the first quarter--did not account for much of the recent
rise. In the week ending May 14, there was an unusually large rise in
business loans at banks in New York City and a large decline at banks
in Chicago. The New York rise included a broad spectrum of industries,
and is reported to have included some borrowing diverted from the
commercial paper market in view of the recently reduced spread between
rates in that market and the prime rate. The drop in Chicago reflects
in part the sales of $250 million of domestic loans, of which 85 per
cent was in business loans, to London branches during the March
crisis; these transactions presumably will be reversed in the coming
weeks.

III -15
Bank deposits. Time and savings deposits at all commercial
banks declined slightly further in April, reflecting sizable deposit
losses at larger banks and less than usual inflows at smaller banks.
The decline at weekly reporting banks represented not only continued
CD attrition, but also substantial outflows of consumer-type time and
savings deposits.

III -16
Outstanding CD's at large banks fell by nearly $1.3 billion
in April and in the first week of May, with New York and Chicago banks
losing another $75 million in the following week. These declines
brought total CD attrition from December 11 to more than $6.8 billion,
or almost 30 per cent of outstandings on that date. The CD run-off
for the month of May should moderate, however, reflecting in large
part the substantially reduced volume of maturing certificates. Banks
with foreign branches increased their Euro-dollar borrowings only
moderately from the end of March through the first week in May. And
in the following week head office liabilities to foreign branches
dropped by $390 million, probably reflecting the reduced availability of
Euro-dollar funds associated with the recent foreign exchange crisis
and the loan sales referred to above.
Consumer-type time and savings deposits at large banks fell
sharply in April and early May, reflecting large withdrawals of
savings deposits and less than usual inflows of time certificates and
open accounts. The declines in savings deposits were particularly
large just prior to and during thd mid-month tax period, but they
moderated substantially in subsequent weeks. Similarly, country
banks experienced sizable outflows of savings deposits around mid-April
but small inflows had resumed by early May. Inflows of other time
deposits at country banks, however, were maintained at about the pace
cf recent years.

III -17
The money stock--measured on a daily average basis--rose
sharply in April at more than an 11 per cent annual rate, compared
to expansion at less than a 2 per cent annual rate over the first
quarter. The April increase reflected in part a large one-week increase
in private demand deposits around the Easter holiday. A bulge in
private cash balances just prior to the mid-April tax payment -date also
contributed importantly to the average increase for the month.
Nonbank depositary intermediaries. Reflecting mainly tax
payments, outflows from the thrift institutions during April were
substantially larger than a year earlier. Outflows tended to be con-
centrated at West Coast S&Ls and New York State savings banks.
Masaachusetts savings banks, which either are not regulated as to rate
or which were recently permitted by FDIC to meet local competition
in setting rates, accounted for all of the $46 million inflow recorded
outside of New York State. Indications for early May suggest some
inflows--albeit smaller than the modest 1968 gains--to intermediaries
in both of the sensitive areas of New York and California. In New
York however, a sharp increase in passbook loans foreshadows future
outflows.

The March-April seasonally adjusted savings growth average
rate of 5 per cent, which is probably more indicative of underlying
trends than either month alone, suggests a gain equivalent only to
the rate of interest/dividends credited, or virtually no net new money.
Responses to the Mortgage Market Survey suggests that the intermediaries
expect second quarter savings flows roughly similar to the first
quarter rate.-

S&L advances from the FHL Banks during April increased by about
$400 million, or somewhat more than seasonally, with West Coast associations,
as is typical, accounting for more than half of the total net increase.
1/ More detailed results of this Survey are presented in the special
supplement distributed with the Greenbook.

III -19
The volume of borrowing was about one-third greater than a year ago, but
was about half the amount in April 1966. Liquidity ratios declined
somewhat as a result of larger-than-seasonal liquidations of cash and
Governments.
The FHLB Board has maintained its position of leniency
regarding advances to support mortgage lending. New money raised by
the System in its recent financing will bring funds available for
advances to more than $1.5 billion. In another action, the FHLB Board
has eased slightly a technicality relating to S&L's required allocations
to reserves; FHLB staff expects the real impact of this change to be
negligible.
Mortgage market. The recently concluded PRB-FHLB survey
of home mortgage market conditions, contained in the special supple-
ment distributed with the Greenbook, confirms that pressures arising
from the reduced pattern of savings inflows at the major thrift institu-
tions have led to a modest tightening in the residential mortgage
market during the past three months. As a result, mortgage interest
rates have been forced higher and the availability of credit, for
conventional loans in particular, has become somewhat more limited.
In addition, the survey also suggests a further shift away from single-
family mortgage loans toward apartment-house mortgages.

III -20
Yields in the secondary market for Government-underwritten
mortgages declined during the most recent FNMA auctions of forward
purchase commitments. Reflecting a higher volume of offerings, the
decline--25 basis points since mid-April--was somewhat less than
in the corporate bond market.

was May 6, 1968.
Despite the recent decline in FNMA secondary market yields,
home mortgage rates continued to rise in April, according to FHA data.
In the primary market--by far the largest sector of the home mortgage
market--the average contract rate for conventional first mortgages rose
slightly more in April than in either of the two previous months.

III -21
Regionally, the largest increases occurred in the Northeast and the West
where thrift institutions were particularly hard hit by an outflow of
funds during April. In the secondary market for Government-underwritten
loans, however, there was little further increase in the average yield
(1 basis point) following a 3-month period of upward adjustment to the
January increase in the FHA and VA ceiling rate. The yield spread
favoring Government-underwritten mortgage over new issues of high-grade
corporate bonds widened in April, though it remained rather unattractive
by pre-1966 standards.
Mortgage lending, particularly on conventional home loans,
has continued to be influenced by comparatively low usury ceilings in
more than half the States. Among other effects, these ceilings have
tended to inhibit inflows of out-of-state investment funds, foster the
outflow of local capital, extend loan closing dates, and encourage a
switch from single-family to multi-family mortgage investments. Since the
end of March, usury ceilings have been adjusted upward in Arizona (10%,
effective July 1), Georgia (9%), Iowa (9%), and Vermont (7-1/2%)--
states which accounted for about 6 per cent of all residential building
permits issued in 1968. Bills to raise usury ceilings are now pending
before legislatures in a number of other States, including Michigan and
Illinois.
In addition to usury ceiling problems, there is some uncertainty
in the market arising from the impending Truth-in-Lending regulations,
which becomes effective July 1. A number of mortgage lenders remain
unclear about the mechanics of the law, while others are uncertain as
to the effect of compliance on their origination costs or on the market-
ability of their loans.

Policy loans at life insurance companies. The net increase
in policy loans extended by life insurance companies during April was
substantially larger than the usual tax-related March-to-April pattern,
and represented the largest volume for any month in the series except
September, 1966. Similarly, the $200 million volume of gross loans
made (not shown in the table) was exceeded only in September, 1966. In
context, $200 million is equivalent to about half the amount of recent
monthly gross acquisitions of mortgages or private placements for a
sample of life insurance companies representing a similar share of the
industry.

The large increase in activity was reported to be uniform
among companies, unlike 1966 when certain mutual companies were especially
affected. Although some further policy loan increases had been anti-
cipated, continuation of the current--generally unexpectedly large--
volume of activity could represent a serious drain on the industry.
Several companies reported that they were revising their cash flow
projections in light of the April--and early May--drains, and would
strive to remain less than fully committed.
Corporate profits in manufacturing. Overall corporate profits
before taxes are currently estimated at a seasonally adjusted annual
rate of $96.0 billion in the first quarter. Preliminary data for the
manufacturing sector--the most volatile and by far the largest compo-
nent of the total--are consistent with the present over-all estimate.
They indicate that, despite a narrowing in the year-to-year increase
in profits and sales, seasonally adjusted profit margins of manu-
facturing corporations inched up in the first quarter. (For
the FTC-SEC series used here, neither sales nor profits are available
on a seasonally adjusted basis.)
While a "profit squeeze" throughout 1969 has been widely
predicted by the business and financial community, increases in unit
prices apparently offset any tendency in this direction in the first
quarter, despite slower growth in total sales volume. In fact, pre-
liminary data indicate a seasonally adjusted profit margin for manufacturing
corporations as a whole which was slightly above its level in each of
the last three quarters of 1968 and higher than at any time since late
1966.

III -25
Profits before taxes of all manufacturing corporations are
estimated to have been 11 per cent larger in the first quarter of
this year than they were a year earlier. The year-to-year increase
had amounted to 16 per cent in the fourth quarter of 1968 and 20
per cent in the third quarter. Sales volume rose only 8 per cent on
a year to-year basis, however, compared with increases of 11 and 10
per cent in the two preceding quarters, and the unadjusted ratio of
profits to sales was 8.7 per cent compared with 8.4 per cent a year
earlier.

Corporate and municipal bond markets. Corporate bond yields
in the first half of May have fluctuated around the lower levels reached
in mid-April, some 50 basis points below their March high. Very recently,
new issue yields have advanced significantly--although this has occurred
since the pricing of issues included in the yield level for the latest
week in the table--and several recent offerings at the lower yield
levels have experienced lukewarm receptions. Corporate new issue
inventories have been reduced by price cutting, but some dealers reportedly
still have sizable inventories of unsold bonds--and large bank financing
requirements--that have also recently acted to restrain aggressiveness.
In the municipal market, yields have advanced more than 20 basis points
since late in April and by mid-May pierced their previous peaks
reached in late March.

Recent upward yield pressure in the municipal market has
resulted in part from the substantial volume of bonds offered in April
and committed for by dealers in the hope of later sales at higher prices.
These bonds are now being delivered but dealers have not been very
successful in placing recent offerings, as banks reportedly have
sharply limited their new commitments. On average, commercial bank
municipal holdings in April showed a significant contraseasonal decline.
In view of deliveries of earlier speculative purchases, the
lackluster sales of recent offerings, and the large negative carry on
municipal inventories, dealers have become very cautious. Several
syndicates have been terminated with sizable upward yield adjustments
and recent new issue bidding has been much less aggressive than during
April. The resulting upward yield movements have generated an increased
volume of postponements, as shown in the table. Tax-exempt bond volume
in May is estimated at slightly less than $1 billion, little changed
from earlier estimates and appreciably below the year-earlier pace as
well as that in April, when volume had been buoyed by a rise of new
offerings to take advantage of then available lower yields.

Municipal bond volume in June is tentatively estimated to
remain relatively low at $0.9 billion, somewhat below May and nearly
$400 million less than the corresponding month a year ago. The estimated
volume implicitly assumes continuation of yield pressure that will
generate further postponements or cancellations; and it reflects also
the absence of large revenue bond issues in June as well as a temporary
lull in the expected issues of large, frequent borrowers.I

In the corporate bond market, public offerings during May
are estimated at $1.0 billion, less than in April but significantly
above the average monthly volume over the first quarter. As shown in the
table, the scheduled volume of issues continues the pattern evident since
late last year, with convertible and public utility issues accounting for
the great bulk of public bond issues.
Corporate security issues in June are estimated at slightly
above May, primarily as a result of usual seasonal factors. Public bond
offerings are expected to total $1.1 billion, $100 million above May.
When taking account of private placements and stock issues total corporate
security offerings are estimated at $2.3 billion in June, about $200
million above the first quarter average monthly volume and the record
average monthly pace set over the full year 1967. Even though public
bond volume is not expected to reach the 1967 volume, this will be more
than offset by the continuing large flow of stock issues.

Stock market. Reflecting improved expectations regarding profits
and the outlook for peace, equity prices rose 4 to 5 per cent from late
April until the President's speech on May 14; during this period, prices
and weekly trading volume rose to new highs for the year. Since the
President's proposals for peace in Vietnam--which were evidently taken
by financial market participants to be less promising than originally
expected--prices have declined, wiping out one-half to two-thirds of
the earlier gains. At this writing (May 20), the Dow-Jones Industrial
and the New York Stock Exchange Composite indicies are only marginally
below their earlier highs reached in February; but prices on the American
Stock Exchange are over 5 per cent below their February 1969 highs.

With volume continuing to drift downward during April as a
whole, the volume of securities not delivered by members of the New
York Stock Exchange within the normal 5-day settlement period tended
further downward, as indicated in the last column of the table. How-
ever, with the recent accelerated pace of trading, "fails" may rise
again in May.
Preliminary data suggest that margin credit extended by
brokers/dealers on the New York Stock Exchange increased somewhat in
April but the volume of such credit, at $5.7 billion, remained about
15 per cent below the level reached in mid-1968, when the Board last

raised margin requirements. Security credit extended by large banks
to other broker/dealers declined in April, by almost $20 million.

bills have risen about 15 to 20 basis points on balance since the
last meeting of the Committee. Over the same period, yields on
Government coupon issues also have advanced, by some 10 to 25 basis
points.

In the early part of the period, uncertainties in the foreign
exchange markets stemming in part from the resignation of President deGaulle
and later from speculatve flows of funds into Germany ceased considerable
nervousness in the Government securities market. Some of the yield back-up
was attributable to these developments. More recently, the absence of any

III -35
breakthrough in the Vietnam peace negotiations, together with continuing
high financing costs and relatively large inventories of coupon issue
acquired in the Treasury's refunding, have contributed to a substantial
weakening of market psychology and further yield advances.
In the refunding the $2.2 billion of public exchanges into
the new 6-1/2 per cent 7-year Treasury note were larger than many
dealers had anticipated, including the overall awards to dealers
themselves. As a result, while dealers' total inventories of Treasury
securities have declined considerably since the last meeting of the
Committee, their holdings of coupon issues are up, especially in the
over 5-year category. Just after the books closed on the refinancing
dealers had net positions of $222 million in the 15-month note, and
$658 million in the 7-year issue. By the settlement date on May 15,
the last date for which data are available, net sales had reduced
these positions to $120 million and $569 million, respectively. The
bulk of the sales of longer notes were made in response to orders from
official accounts. Most recently as market psychology has deteriorated,
some dealers have moved rather aggressively to make further reductions
in their holdings of the new 6-1/2, with most of their progress again
being accounted for by sizable official purchases.

Dealers' remaining positions in all Treasury issues have had
to be financed at high rates. Federal funds often have traded in an
8 to 9 per cent range or above in recent trading sessions, and the
associated lending rates to Government security dealers at major money
center banks have at times reached levels as high as 10-1/8 per cent.
The relatively low levels of bill rates that developed around
the time of the last meeting were due in part to expectations of good-
sized demand from selling of rights and from attrition in the refunding.
While dealers were disappointed by the actual size of this demand,
churning associated with developments in the foreign exchange markets
generated a sizable foreign demand for bills. In fact, the Desk made
$1.4 billion of net bill purchases for foreign accounts between April
29 and May 19 (the time period covered by the dealer position table)
over half of which were for the German central bank. Over the same12

period, the Desk bought $568 million of bills directly for System account.
These dema nds tended to keep bill rates from rising, despite the very
tight money market conditions. But most recently, the persistence of
money market tightness has contributed to a further back-up of yields
despite the sharp drop in dealer bill positions.
Yields on most other short-term instruments also have advanced
over the past month, in line with the general rise in interest rates.
As the accompanying table indicates, these rate increases have averaged
around 1/8 to 1/2 of a percentage point.

Federal finance. Preliminary data available for April and
early May suggest that both receipts and outlays for fiscal 1969 may
have been running higher than staff estimates shown in the last Green-
book. On the receipts side, the upward adjustment -- which amounts
to about $600 million -- stems chiefly from larger than expected
corporate tax payments in April and from higher individual income tax
payments in May. On the expenditure side, outlays for April appear
to have been $1.3 billion larger than previously projected, with an
upsurge in defense spending accounting for the bulk of the increase.
It is not clear whether this overrun reflects Vietnam outlays, or other
defense expenditures not exempt from the expenditures ceiling. If
recent increases are of the latter type, these together with spending
increases on Farmers' Home Administration and other non-exempt programs,
could quickly use up the leeway remaining under the spending ceiling.
In the Administration's recent Budget Review the implied leeway
for estimated non-exempt outlays remaining below the expenditure ceiling
amounted to $1.3 billion. But the Board staff projection for fiscal
1969 now sets total outlays at $186.2 billion, which would bring non-
exempt outlays up to the maximum allowed and eliminate the leeway. At
the end of any fiscal year, budget officers typically possess con-
siderable flexibility for adjusting expenditure data that go into the
final budget accounts, resorting to such things as delayed issuance of
checks particularly in defense programs. With another expenditure

III -40
ceiling now likely for fiscal 1970, however, it is not clear how actively
such measures will be used this year.
After some decline in May and early June, the Treasury cash
balance is expected to rise to about $7.5 billion by the end of June.
Recent shifts of dollar balances by foreign central banks into special
Treasury notes added over $1 billion to the Treasury balance, but this
windfall is expected to be short-lived, since the funds are now in the
process of being withdrawn for direct investment. in higher yielding
marketable Treasury bills. Assuming a balance around $7.5 billion at
midyear, the Treasury could probably defer cash borrowing in the new
fiscal year until late July or early August.
Budgetary prospects for all of fiscal 1970 remain beset by
uncertainties concerning (1) extenstion of the surtax, (2) repeal of
the investment tax credit, (3) tax reform, (4) the timing of increased
social security benefits and tax rates, (5) the format of a new spend-
ing ceiling, and (6) the significance of the recent upsurge in defense
spending as compared to the Administration's budget review projection.
The latter holds defense spending level for the first three quarters
of calendar 1969 (apart from the July pay-raise), and then schedules a
significant decline during the following three quarters.
In testimony at the May 20 hearings on extension of the surtax,
the Budget Director presented the latest official estim ate for fiscal
1970, showing a projected surplus of $6.3 billion. No change was made

III -41
in the earlier $192.9 billion estimate of outlays--which among other
things assumes a 7 per cent increase in social security benefit payments
and an increase in postal rates, neither of which now seems likely in
the form requested. Estimated receipts are adjusted upward by $500
million, however, assuming that the surcharge will be extended as
requested, and that the investment tax credit will be repealed.

U.S. balance of payments. Any expectation that the U.S. balance
of payments would rebound quickly from the deep first-quarter deficit has
been submerged by what seem to be very large outflows of capital related
to speculation on revaluation of the German mark. In the first quarter,
there was a deficit of $1.8 billion on the liquidity basis, and a somewhat
larger deficit on the adjusted over-all basis (see Appendix C for a discussion
of this measure which takes the place of the "liquidity balance before special
transactions"). The marked worsening at the beginning of the year could be
explained in terms of the effects of the strike-induced weakness in the
trade balance and the resurgence of corporate capital outflows. Once these
adverse elements were absorbed, it was hoped the balance for the rest of
the year would be considerably better. This result was also implied by an
inter-agency projection for the year discussed below. Heavy deficits in
April and May, however, have cast some doubt on these expectations.
The April liquidity deficit before seasonal adjustment was about
$800 million, according to the early indicators. Seasonal factors are
adverse, but even after rough seasonal adjustment the April deficit would

IV -2
be over $1/2 billion. Inflows of foreign capital to purchase U.S. equity
securities are estimated on partial tabulations to have held up at some-
thing like the $100 million per month March rate, but the trade balance
was probably still very low. In the first two weeks of May, the liquidity
deficit soared to about $2 billion. Since there is no evidence of a dramatic
shift in the usual types of transactions, this sudden worsening seems to be
the result of anticipations of a revaluation of the German mark. There may
have been some withdrawal of foreign ("non-liquid") funds invested in the
United States, but it seems likely that the largest element was an outflow
of U.S. capital.
Reflows out of Germany after the decision against revaluation was
announced have amounted to about one quarter of the inflow that occurred
through May 9, and there may be some return of U.S. funds that would lower
the U.S. deficit later in the quarter. In the case of U.S. corporations that
placed funds abroad early in May, the OFDI regulations limiting the holding
of liquid funds abroad may force some repatriation by the end of the month
(though reports are not required until the end of the quarter.)
On the official settlements basis there was probably near balance
in April, as liabilities to commercial banks abroad (including branches of
U.S. banks) rose by over $3/4 billion, in spite of a sharp attrition of
these accounts at the end of that month. In the first two weeks of May,
however, there was little net change in these liabilities to commercial
banks abroad, as an increase early in the month was eliminated by attri-
tion in the second week (see page IV-10). The official settlements

IV -3
deficit in this half month was therefore about the same ($2 billion) as the
deficit on the liquidity basis.
The adjusted over-all balance described in Appendix C gives
results generally close to the liquidity balance before special transactions.
This year, since special transactions have been relatively small and changes
in liquid liabilities to private foreigners other than commercial banks
are not known to have been large, the change in underlying transactions
shown by the adjusted balance does not differ significantly from the change
in the liquidity balance.
Prospects for 1969. With temporary factors bulking so large in
the balance of payments in recent months, and so little known about the
strength of basic economic factors at work, this is not a propitious time
to make forecasts. However, a projection for the year was made by an inter-
agency committee early in May, and it may be useful to survey briefly the
broad outlines of the results.
With respect to merchandise trade, the outlook for the second half
as well as for the entire year reflected in the projection is considerably
less optimistic than in earlier estimates. It is now thought that the trade
balance in 1969 will be not much different from last year with exports lower
and imports higher than earlier expected.
Exports in calendar 1969 are still estimated to be substantially
greater than in 1968, by about 8-1/2 per cent. Perhaps $400 million of
exports may have been lost permanently as a result of the dock strike, half in

IV -4
agricultural products and half in other categories. Commercial aircraft
exports, which increased sharply last year, are expected to fall by 20 to
25 per cent in 1969 as deliveries of current models slow down prior to
the scheduled deliveries of the new larger Boeing 747's in 1970. Most
of this decline is likely to occur in the second half of the year. Ship-
ments of cars and parts to Canada should continue to rise, though not by
as much as imports of cars and parts from Canada.
Nonagricultural exports other than of aircraft and of cars to
Canada will be favorably affected by stronger demand pressures in Europe
than earlier assumed, partly offset by the negative effect of more rapid
price advances here than abroad. For this group of products, the 1967-68
increase was 8-1/2 per cent and the 1968-69 increase is now expected to
be about 12 per cent. A major element in this expected large growth is
an acceleration in foreign demand for U.S. machinery. Export orders for
such equipment rose steeply in February and March and for the first quarter
were 20 per cent higher than in the first quarter of 1968.
Imports in 1969 are now expected to be about $1 billion larger
than previously thought, owing mainly to greater demand pressures and
price increases in the United States.
The net export balance on services and military transactions is
now expected to be slightly lower this year--about $1/4 billion--than in
1968. A principal factor holding down this balance is the high level of
U.S. interest payments to foreigners. Even the present estimate of income

IV -5
payments, $3.6 billion, may be too low if current Euro-dollar interest rates
should prevail throughout the year.
Taking both the merchandise and other current transactions into
account, this projection results in a current account surplus of about
$1.6 billion, compared with $2.0 billion in 1968. This is a sharp revision
from the earlier estimate for 1969, which projected a $3.8 billion surplus
on current account.
International capital flows are apparently even more volatile
than usual this year, and an extremely wide range of possibilities exists
even under the present controls. The net outflow of U.S. corporate capital
in 1968 (net of the use of funds borrowed abroad) was only about $400
million. Given the liberalization of the controls, and the carry-over of
unused "allowables" from 1968, the outflow of U.S. funds for direct invest-
ment abroad could be very much greater this year. Estimates provided to
the Office of Foreign Direct Investments by the major direct investors
would result in an increase in $1 billion over 1968. That would still be
within the 1969 program ceiling but assumes that the carry-forward of
allowables would not diminish. In addition, there is no regulatory limit
on ordinary commercial credits, or on funds placed abroad by U.S. residents
who are not direct investors. In the projection for 1969, an allowance
was made for total corporate outflows to increase by about $1 billion; this
now seems comparatively modest.

IV -6
The other major element in long-term private capital flows has
been foreign investments in U.S. corporate stocks, and the current projection,
taking note of the sizable inflows in the first quarter, puts this amount
close to the $1.9 billion of last year. Changes in claims on foreigners
reported by U.S. banks are also projected to be close to last year's small
inflow, in spite of the larger ceiling in the 1969 voluntary restraint
program.
In broad outline, therefore, the inter-agency group view early
in May was that U.S. international transactions, under the assumptions given,
would make no net progress toward balance in 1969, though the measures being
taken to slow domestic demand might be establishing the necessary basis for
improvement next year. The current account balance would be slightly smaller
than in 1968, U.S. private capital outflows would rise by about $1 billion
(after deducting the use of funds derived from borrowing abroad), and the
inflow of foreign private capital to purchase securities or make direct
investments in the United States would be slightly reduced from the 1968
peak. These and other elements would result in an over-all deterioration
of roughly $2 billion in terms of the adjusted over-all balance. As noted
above, the deficit for 1969 through May 14 had already exceeded the 1968
figure by that amount.
The inter-agency group did not attempt to project the outcome on
the official settlements basis for the year. Foreign official claims on
the United States were reduced by $1.7 billion in the first quarter (not

IV -7
seasonally adjusted) and the increase in such claims of about $3.4 billion
from the end of March through May 14 was more than accounted for by a gain
of $4.3 billion in German official accounts. It is quite possible that for
the remainder of the year there will not be significant further changes in
foreign official accounts, and that despite a very large deficit on the
adjusted over-all basis there will not be any serious reduction in U.S.
reserve assets. Through May 14, U.S. reserve assets increased by $894 million,
including $125 million in gold, $109 million in our IMF position, and some
$600 million in convertible currencies. The last item reflects very largely
swap drawings by several countries at the time of the speculative flow into
German marks.
Foreign exchange market developments. From April 22 through May 9
foreign exchange markets were caught up in the development of an increasingly
speculative atmosphere. Conditions and events in Germany lay at the bottom
of this development--see Page IV -11 --and its timing was affected by
uncertainty over the French referendum and then de Gaulle's defeat. Finally,
in the week of May 5-9 there was a massive speculative rush into German marks.
During those three weeks the Bundesbank purchased about $4.8 billion spot and
swapped out about $650 million before ceasing its swap operations on May 8.
At the height of the speculation--May 8 and 9--the Bundesbank purchased about
$1.2 billion per day. Since the German announcement on May 9 that the current
mark parity would be held, the Bundesbank has sold only about $1.1 billion.
Exchange market doubts about the permanence of this decision were reinforced

IV -8
by the apparent inadequacy of the package of measures which German authorities
announced last week to support their decision not to revalue.
The massive flow of funds into marks had its counterpart in flows
out of all major currencies, including especially the dollar. Very fragmentary
information available suggests that more than one-third of the Bundesbank
reserve increase came from sales of dollars by other central banks, more
than one-third from mark purchases by U.S. non-bank residents, and a little
less than one-third out of the Euro-dollar market (as reflected in the
decline in U.S. bank liabilities to their overseas branches). Selling
pressure was heavy against the pound and the French franc. In the three
weeks from April 22 to May 9 the Bank of England had losses of about $550
million and the Bank of France had losses of about $515 million. The
reserve drains prompted by the speculation were also relatively severe
in the case of the Danish and Belgian central banks although most major
central banks were hit with some reserve losses.
Since May 9 the reflow of funds into sterling--the Bank of England
has purchased about $325 million--has been especially encouraging despite
the announcement of the poor U.K. trade figures for April. Demand for
French francs has also been firm and the Bank of France has purchased about
$125 million since May 9. Current conditions in exchange markets are very
quiet and market participants appear to be waiting to see how soon the
build-up of speculative funds in Germany runs off. Next week is an especially
short trading week with a holiday throughout Europe on Monday and a holiday

IV -9
in the United States on Friday; so exchange markets are expected to remain
relatively inactive until after the first of June, when the French election
occurs.

Euro-dollar market. The extremely large speculative movement of
funds to the German mark which began in late April exerted strong pressures
on the Euro-dollar market, whether through deposit attrition or through
demand to borrow dollars (to buy marks). Euro-dollar rates advanced very
sharply, particularly in the days just before the German authorities
announced on May 9 their decision against a revaluation. On Thursday, May 8,
the bid rate for call deposits reached 10 per cent per annum; three- and
six-month deposit rates hit 9-13/16 per cent per annum and one-year deposits
were bid at 9-5/8 per cent per annum. One-month deposits reached their
peak level of 9-15/16 per cent per annum on Friday, May 9. At these peaks
the call deposit rate was more than 2 percentage points above its late
April level, and rates in the longer maturities had risen between 120 and
190 basis points.
Euro-dollar rates declined moderately during the first few days
following the cessation of the flow of funds into German marks but have
tended to firm in recent days. As of May 21 rates in most maturities
are near 9-1/2 per cent per annum.

IV -10-
U.S. bank's liabilities to their foreign branches declined by
$1.4 billion between April 23 and May 13. (More than $300 million of
this decline, however, reflected sell-offs of domestic loans to London
branches). Since May 13, liabilities to branches have increased somewhat.

Balances of payments and reserves of other countries. Changes
in the underlying payments positions of the other industrial countries
have been especially difficult to discern this year, because of the effects
on short-term capital movements of the very high U.S. demand for Euro-
dollars and because of the renewed speculation on a revaluation of the
German mark. Moreover, seasonal adjustment problems and accounting
differences add to the difficulties of matching up a net total of surpluses
in other industrial countries against the U.S. deficit on current and
long-term capital accounts. Both Britain and France continue to suffer
from serious deficits in their "basic" balance of payments (i.e., on
current and long-term capital accounts). Italy's seasonal deficit in the
first quarter was much larger than last year, and Canada's payments position
has been close to equilibrium since the beginning of 1969. Japan, and
probably also Switzerland, had surpluses on current and long-term capital
account in the first quarter. For Germany, whose underlying balance of
payments is potentially in surplus, outflows of long-term capital were
more than enough to offset the current account surplus in the first quarter.
For the second time in six months, expectations of possible changes
in currency parities have given rise to massive purchases of German marks
by holders of various other currencies. Speculation that the mark might
be revalued upward was revived after the German central bank's discount
rate was raised on April 17, and beginning April 30 was greatly intensified
by various remarks made by German officials. A major part of the
purchases of marks were made by businesses and others moving out of

IV -12
dollars--in the United States or in the Euro-dollar market--but the
central banks of the United Kingdom and France lost large amounts of
reserves. The Danish central bank was also a very heavy loser of reserves.
(See pages IV- to for additional information.)
After the May 9 announcement of the German Government's decision
not to revalue, there was a reflow out of marks of some of the funds that
had come in during the previous three weeks.
The renewed speculation on the mark rested on the belief that
capital outflows from Germany could not continue at their recent high
levels and that consequently a large and persistent surplus would soon
re-emerge in Germany's balance of payments. For some months prior to
April, outflows of long-term private capital from Germany had been
sufficiently large to more than compensate for the surplus on current
transactions, but it was recognized that these flows were occurring at
a time when credit markets in Germany were extremely easy in relation
to markets in most other industrial countries. The rise in the Bundesbank's
discount rate from 3 to 4 per cent on April 17 was widely interpreted as
the harbinger of a period when the relative ease in German credit markets
would lessen. The conviction that reduced capital outflows would mean the
reappearance of an over-all surplus was based on the assumption that
Germany's large trade surplus would be little reduced by the border tax
adjustments put into effect late last year after the November crisis.
Although the impact of those measures is still unclear, German exporters

IV -13
have apparently absorbed part of the reduction in the border tax rebates,
and can still promise early delivery dates. Export orders are continuing
to rise strongly.
The particular susceptibility of the pound and the franc to
speculative attack in recent weeks has been related, in each instance,
to the persistence of serious trade deficits in those countries. After
some improvement in previous months, Britain's trade performance was
sorely disappointing in the months of February, March and April. In the
French case, the trade deficit has remained large in 1969 notwithstanding
the austerity moves in the fiscal and monetary areas decided upon last
November. New credit measures to curb consumer buying were announced in
France on May 8. The possibility, followed by the fact, of General de
Gaulle's resignation also suggested to exchange market operators that
devaluation had become a more likely solution to France's external
imbalance, even though such a step is highly unlikely before a new
government takes office.
Prior to the recent crisis, international payments developments
in the first three and a half months of this year were highlighted by
the impact of increased demand for Euro-dollars on the part of U.S. banks,
and by the regulatory and monetary policy actions taken in a number of
countries at least partially in response to the increased flow of Euro-
dollars to the United States. Increased net lendings to the Euro-dollar
market (or reduced borrowing from that market) by commercial banks and
others outside the United States have the effect of decreasing the dollar

IV -14
holdings of central banks if the funds are relent to U.S. banks. With
a large balance of payments deficit in prospect, the French authorities
took action in January to isolate French banks from the pull of the
Euro-currency markets, and in fact to force some repatriation of funds.
In February the Bundesbank and the Bank of Italy halted or greatly reduced
their swaps of dollars with commercial banks, and later the Bank of Italy
required Italian banks to repatriate a large volume of funds prior to
June 30. In the Italian case, domestic considerations were also importantly
involved in this decision, which was accompanied by other measures aimed
at reducing capital outflows. These developments on the supply side
contributed to a further sharp rise of Euro-dollar interest rates in
February, and since then these rates have remained very high. Belgium
has also acted to require banks to repatriate Euro-dollars.

Germany's over-all balance of payments registered a deficit
of $677 million in the first quarter, as measured by changes in official
and commercial bank net foreign assets. This was in sharp contrast with
the surplus of $744 million recorded in the first quarter of 1968, and
it produced a 12-month deficit, through March, of $503 million. Long-
term capital outflows were extremely large in the first quarter, and
greatly exceeded the current account surplus, which was somewhat reduced
by special factors. (The reduction in border taxes on German imports
decided upon last November 20 became effective immediately, but the
reduction in border tax rebates on exports did not become effective until
December 23. In the interim, export shipments were sharply accelerated,
at the expense of shipments subsequent to December 23; the shift amounted
to $300 million in round terms.)
Imports in the first quarter were 11 per cent higher than in
the fourth quarter of 1968, the marked rapidity of this rise being a result
at least partly of the lower border taxes. But the cut in the border
tax rebate for exports seems to be having little effect toward reducing
export sales. Export shipments in March (seasonally adjusted) were 4 per
cent above November. New export orders in January-February (seasonally
adjusted) were about equal to the November level, but soared in March,
so that export orders in February-March were up 9 per cent (preliminary)
from December-January.

IV -16
The net outflow of long-term private capital from Germany in
the first quarter came to $1.4 billion, well above the already high
levels of $0.9 billion and $0.6 billion in the two previous quarters
respectively. Flotations of mark-denominated bonds by foreign borrowers--
a large portion of which were acquired by German commercial banks--accounted
for about one-half of the first quarter outflow, and bank loans (of over
one-year maturity) for most of the remainder. Only a small percentage
of the total was offered by U.S. companies.
The Bundesbank's net foreign assets declined by $2.2 billion
in December-January as the combined result of the basic paymentsdeficit,
an unwinding of the November speculative inflow indicated, for example,
by nearly $600 million of withdrawals by foreign residents of mark balances
from German banks, and an increase of about $1.1 billion in German banks'
net lendings in the Euro-dollar market. Liquid foreign currency balances
of the Bundesbank were reduced to about $1.4 billion at the end of January,
a level well below that prevailing prior to November. To discourage
further placements of bank funds in the Euro-dollar market, in the period
from late December to early March the Bundesbank gradually raised the
cost to banks of preferential dollar/mark swaps. Banks' recourse to
new swaps declined progressively after January and, as outstanding swaps
matured, the banks' net foreign assets were reduced in February and
March. In those two months German banks' net leadings in the Euro-dollar
market appear to have been reduced by about $550 million.

The German Government's decision on May 9 not to revalue was
followed by several Cabinet actions in the balance of payments and fiscal
areas, some of them subject to Parliamentary approval. The Bundesbank is
to be given authority to impose minimum reserve requirements of up to--
I I .I I

IV -18
100 per cent against all outstanding foreign liabilities of German
banks, rather than merely to increases since some base date; at present,
for example, the 100 per cent requirement applies only to increases
since April 15. Such authority would presumably enable the Bundesbank
to force German banks to expel foreign funds. The border tax measures
of last November will be extended indefinitely instead of expiring at
the end of March 1970. With regard to the budget, Federal and some State
tax receipts in excess of original 1969 estimates will be "blocked" at
the Bundesbank,and Federal expenditures will rise less this year than
was planned. The fiscal measures are alternatives to currency revaluation
only as domestic anti-inflationary measures; they would tend to enlarge
rather than reduce a balance of payments surplus. However, they are not
expected to have a significant effect in damping down demand in Germany
this year.
The external postion of France has shown deficits of apparently
increasing magnitude this year, and reserve losses have been very large.
The decline in official net foreign assets in the first four months of
the year (including drawings on central bank swap facilities) came to
$420 million; further reserve losses in the first 15 days of May are
estimated at $250 million; and commercial banks' net foreign liabilities
increased by $571 million.in January-February (figures for later months
being unavailable). During February and perhaps later also, transfers
of dollars were made from commercial banks to the monetary authorities
under a January 31 regulation.

IV -19
The trade deficit has been not only a direct cause of France's
external imbalance, but an indirect one as well in that the persistence
of a large trade deficit has induced speculative capital outflows. The
trade deficit was already at a high level at the close of last year
because of the extremely rapid rise of imports in the previous six months.
From December through March, there was no further rise in imports from
countries outside the franc area,which averaged almost the same (seasonally
adjusted) in February-March as in November-December. But export expansion
has slowed down despite last November's changes in French taxation and
related changes in border tax adjustments designed to increase French
competitiveness,
Aggregate demand in France continued to increase strongly
during the first quarter and into April, with consumer demand especially
buoyant. New credit restrictions announced on May 8 included a tightening
of consumer credit terms, particularly for automobiles, and an extension
through December of very tight ceilings on expansion of short-term bank
credit. Maximum interest rates on most time deposits were raised one-
half percentage point, and the ceiling was abolished for certificates of
deposit of over 100,000 francs (about $20,000).
Reserve losses in March-May were far in excess of the trade
deficit; the trade deficit with non-franc area countries (and with imports
estimated on an f.o.b. basis) was about $140 million in March and $165 mil-
lion in April. There may have been outflows of foreign capital, which
are not subject to exchange controls. French capital has been illegally

IV -20
moved via banknote exports to Switzerland and via capital transfers
through overseas franc area countries where enforcement of controls
is reportedly lax. Accelerated remittances of foreign workers' earnings,
and advance purchases of foreign currency available under the tourist
allowance, may also have contributed to the enlarged deficits.
French commercial banks with net foreign assets in foreign
currency on January 31 were required to place them in a special dollar
account at the Bank of France prior to April 25, in accordance with a
schedule. The deposits bear interest daily at the call money rate but
cannot be counted for reserve requirement purposes. Reportedly, the
sums deposited totaled several hundred million dollars and were earmarked
for repayment by the Bank of France of swaps with French commercial banks
made in 1968. Banks with net foreign liabilities in foreign currency at
the end of January have been prohibited from reducing them. Both these
measures contributed to the tightening of the Euro-dollar market.
Britain has seemingly made little progress this year in its
continuing efforts to shift from external deficit to surplus, although
reserve changes were favorable up to mid-April thanks to short-term capital
inflows. The deficit in the current account has in all probability been
at a rate little less than in 1968, when it amounted for that year as a
whole to $1.0 billion, and the same is likely to have been true of
the "basic balance" (current and long-term capital accounts), on which
last year's deficit was $1.1 billion.

IV -21
In the first four months of this year the seasonally adjusted
trade deficit on the balance of payments basis averaged $110 million per
month. While this was better than the $137 million average for 1968,
the month-to-month changes have shown some deterioration since January.
Imports declined late in 1968 and again in January, but from January to
April they moved up again by 4 per cent. Exports, on the other hand,
have been more or less stable thus far in 1969. The average monthly
trade deficit in March-April was $133 million, barely below the 1968
level. The U.S. dock strike probably reduced Britain's first-quarter
imports and exports in equal proportions, perhaps 2 per cent in each case.
For the first quarter, net foreign liabilities of the British
monetary authorities were reduced by $456 million and those owed by
commercial banks in Britain contracted an additional $67 million. The
contrast between this reserve gain and the basic balance of payments
deficit of several hundred million dollars is partly ascribable to inflows
of short-term capital in the form of payments by foreign exporters of
the import deposits required since the end of November 1968. It is
presumed that a substantial part of the $1.1 billion equivalent paid
in under this regulation through April 30 has come from abroad. Because
these deposits are refunded after six months, after the end of May their
outstanding amount will tend to rise relatively slowly and the short-term
capital inflows associated with them until now will tend to disappear.
In addition, seasonally favorable trade movements of outer sterling area

IV -22
countries with third countries contributed to Britain's reserves;
the exchange value guarantee of official sterling balances granted in
connection with the Basle agreement of September 1968 is a deterrent to
withdrawals of these balances.
Because of a much higher level of capital outflow, Italy's
over-all balance of payments deficit in the first four months was $569 mil-
lion, as compared with $129 million a year earlier. The first quarter is
seasonally weak for Italy, which for the full year 1968 ran a surplus of
$586 million. The total net outflow of non-bank capital (nearly all of
it private) in the first quarter increased from $410 million to $732 mil-
lion between the two first quarters, the bulk of it continuing to be
financed by illegal exports of Italian banknotes. Although tighter credit
conditions outside Italy undoubtedly caused capital outflows to increase,
investors' uneasiness related to student and worker disturbances is
thought to have been another factor.
The Italian authorities are now seeking to hold down the exodus
of Italian capital. Measures announced early in April should severely
restrict sales in Italy of foreign mutual funds. The participation of Italian
banks in the underwriting of bond issues outside the country--which last
year may have approached $400 million--will be subject to issue-by-issue
authorization, in the expectation that purchases of foreign bonds by
non-bank Italian investors will thereby be reduced. It is not known
how liberally the authorizations will be given, but some have been granted

IV -23
in recent weeks. These moves reflect a desire to facilitate the
raising of risk capital and to promote the current cyclical expansion by
keeping Italian capital markets easier than otherwise. There may also be
some official concern over the balance of payments outlook, in view of
the much higher level of capital outflow this year and the possibility
that domestic expansion will reduce the current account surplus.
For reasons akin to those just set forth, in February the
Bank of Italy stopped its swaps of dollars for lire with Italian commercial
banks (by raising their cost), and in March instructed banks that by
June 30 they must liquidate their net foreign assets, which at the end of
January were about $800 million. Italian banks reduced their net foreign
assets by some $350 million in the period February through April, after
having increased their net lendings in the Euro-dollar market on a heavy
scale in preceding months.
First-quarter data show a balance of payments surplus for the
Netherlands compared with a deficit a year earlier and a deficit for the
full year 1968 of $100 million. About half of the year-to-year improve-
ment in the first quarter reflected a reduction in the trade deficit
since the end of last year, despite continuing strong inflationary
pressures.
Belgium continued to run a deficit in the first quarter because
of capital outflows, but the imbalance was less than a year earlier and
much smaller than the deficits in the latter half of 1968 that were largely
responsible for Belgium's $222 million deficit for all of last year.

IV -24
Outflows of non-bank capital seem to have slowed in 1969, influenced
by the exceedingly sharp increases in short-term interest rates in
Belgium since last fall. Belgian banks, however, increased their net
foreign assets considerably in January and February in response to the
pull of the Euro-dollar market, and by end-February net official reserves
were down $320 million from last June 30. Although the banks' net
foreign position was practically unchanged in March, early in April the
National Bank of Belgium issued instructions which, it is believed, require
banks to reduce their gross foreign assets by perhaps about $150 million
by the end of June.
Sweden's balance of payments was rather severely in deficit
in the first quarter, despite the fact that the trade balance strengthened
markedly after the turn of the year. The deficit seems to be a reflection
of a substantial outflow of non-bank capital. This may have slowed
down, however, after the rise in the discount rate from 5 to 6 per cent
at the end of February and the steps taken in March to restrain credit
expansion. Much of the first-quarter deficit was financed by a rundown
of the commercial banks' net foreign assets, a development contrary to
that in most other Western European countries.
The large decline in Swiss official reserves since January has
reflected the placement abroad of funds which Swiss commercial banks
repatriated in December for liquidity reasons, together with some
seasonal weakness in trade and tourism. Switzerland had an extremely
large balance of payments surplus of $1.15 billion in 1968. It is

IV -25
estimated that the current account was in surplus by about $450 million
last year, and there are no indications of worsening this year.
The Canadian balance of payments was in equilibrium on an
unadjusted basis in the first quarter of the year, following large surpluses
in each of the three preceding quarters. Seasonally adjusted, there was
a surplus of about $175 million. The shift from a $341 million surplus
in the fourth quarter of 1968 to virtual balance in this year's first quarter
was the result largely of changes in flows of non-bank short-term capital
under the influence of tighter U.S. credit conditions. The current account
showed only a minor seasonal weakening, and seasonally adjusted imports
and exports both advanced 7 per cent over the previous quarter. Net
receipts of long-term capital were probably at least as great as in
the fourth quarter, since deliveries to foreigners of bonds newly issued
by the Federal and provincial governments and Canadian corporations in
January and February alone exceeded the total for the fourth quarter by
$137 million. In contrast with the marked change in flows of non-bank
short-term funds, Canadian banks increased their net short-term foreign
assets by a relatively small $64 million, little more than in the fourth
quarter. The Canadian dollar was virtually untouched by the April-May
speculation on the mark.
In Japan, the balance of payments remained heavily in surplus
in the first four months of the year, and the surplus on merchandise trade
increased. The swing from a deficit of $259 million in January-April 1968

IV -26
to a surplus of $438 million this year was mainly a reflection of an
increased trade surplus, although a slimming of the deficit on services
also was instrumental. In the first quarter, seasonally adjusted exports
rose a further 6 per cent over the fourth quarter, but imports fell back
2 per cent. Compared with a year earlier, exports were 29 per cent
higher and imports 10 per cent higher.
Further increases in Japanese net official reserves in the first
quarter brought the total gain for the latest 12-month period to $1.25 bil-
lion. In April, however, official net reserves declined $119 million,
as Japanese commercial banks reduced their net foreign liabilities by
$270 million. On April 8 the Bank of Japan gave Japanese banks permission
to shift from dollar to yen import financing and to repay about $250 mil-
lion of gross short-term foreign liabilities in the second quarter. This
action was taken in the light of the high interest rates prevailing in
both the Euro-dollar market and the United States.

APPENDIX A: SURVEY OF BANK LOAN COMMITMENTS, JANUARY 1969
On October 31, the System launched a new quarterly survey of
loan commitments at 48 of the largest respondents in the Quarterly
Interest Rate Survey--that is, banks with total deposits of $1 billion
or more, and a second survey was conducted on January 31. The results
of the first two surveys, tabulated according to special procedures 1/
necessary to provide meaningful data comparisons, are summarized below.
Results of the Surveys.
Total unused commitments of the sample of 42 banks that reported
all items on the January 31 survey were in excess of $48 billion, with
nearly 80 per cent extended to commercial and industrial firms, as shown
1/ Owing to the limited advance notice, reporting on the first survey
was incomplete and in some cases inaccurate due to misunderstanding of
the reporting form instructions. Many of these difficulties had been
resolved by the time the second survey was conducted as of January 31,
although some banks were still unable by that time to provide all the
detail requested. Consequently, special tabulation procedures had to
be developed in order to provide meaningful interrelationships of the
data. The major focus in the revised procedures was to assure internal
consistency and comparability of the statistics. This imposed two prin-
cipal constraints: (1) Tabulations showing interrelationships of re-
ported items, such as components to totals and new commitments to unused
commitments, were confined to those reports in which information had
been supplied for all items. Thus, banks indicating that certain items
were not available or that had combined items (other than term loans and
revolving credit commitments to commercial and industrial firms) were
excluded. (2) Tabulations showing changes in commitments from the pre-
vious survey were confined to a matched sample of banks reporting com-
parable data on both surveys. In the January survey, 42 of the 48 res-
pondents submitted reports that were sufficiently complete to be in-
cluded in the over-all tabulation of commitments by types, while only
34 respondents had submitted reports in both October and January that
were suitable for comparisons between surveys and of new commitments
to outstandings. Satisfactory responses to the qualitative questions
were provided by 47 banks in October and 48 in January. In the tabu-
lations, where the sample of responses has been cut back for matching
purposes, the number of banks included is shown in parentheses. Hope-
fully, as banks are able to supply more complete data, the tabulations
can be expended to include all 48 respondents. Until then, time series
generated by these surveys will need to be viewed with caution since
the number of banks included in the tabulations will vary from survey
to survey.

A -2
in Table 1. For the 34 banks submitting reports in January and October
suitable for comparison, unused commitments to commercial and industrial
firms fell by over $1 billion during the three months ending January 31,
while unused commitments to nonbank financial institutions and mortgage
commitments both registered small increases.
Commitments to C&I firms. New commitments made to C&I firms
during the three months covered by the January survey were almost one-
third of the amount of unused commitments outstanding on October 31, 1968,
but takedowns, expirations, and cancellations (hereafter referred to
simply as takedowns) were even larger. The high rate of takedowns prob-
ably reflected the marked acceleration of the growth rate in business
loans outstanding during these three months. Nevertheless, unused C&I
commitments on January 31 remained greater than total C&I loans outstanding
at the sample banks.
Confirmed lines of credit constitute the largest category of
unused commitments to C&I firms, accounting for nearly two-thirds of
the total and three-fifths of the new commitments made during the
quarter. Percentage increases of new commitments were also high in
both the term loan and other commitments categories, while takedowns in
both categories were in excess of 50 per cent of all available commit-
ments. The volume of unused commitments on term loans--which is a
factor of particular concern to banks during periods of monetary re-
straint in view of their slow roll-over--declined by more than one-
fourth between October and January, and accounted for less than 5 per
cent of the total for C&I loans on January 31. Unused commitments on
revolving credits, which generally run for a year or two, also declined
between October and January, and account for nearly one-fourth of the
unused C&I total on January 31.
Nonbank financial institution and mortgage commitments. Unused
commitments to nonbank financial institutions rose slightly over the
three months, bringing the ratio of these commitments to the amount of
loans outstanding to those institutions to over 135 per cent. The ratio
of finance company commitments to finance company loans was almost 175
per cent at the end of January. However, as a measure of relative ex-
posure compared with other loan categories, this is not a meaningful
figure, since many finance companies rotate their use of credit lines
among their banks throughout the year, and generally try to schedule
takedowns to the convenience of the individual bank. Unused commitments
to acquire residential real estate mortgages showed the sharpest rise--
nearly 22 per cent--for any category during the January survey quarter.
Mortgage loan commitments, however, account for a relatively small per-
centage of total, and most of them were construction loans.
Policy views. About 75 per cent of the respondent banks indi-
cated that their commitment policy was more restrictive on January 31
than it had been three months earlier, while no banks eased their com-
mitment policies, as shown in Table 3. In the October survey, only
about 20 per cent of the respondents had firmed their commitment policy
from that of three months earlier. In the January survey, banks that

A- 3
stiffened their commitment policies tended to be those that experienced
increases in unused commitments in the preceding three months--ending
in January--and that anticipated takedowns to increase in the next three
months (Table 4). About 45 per cent of banks firming commitment policies
gave reduced availability of funds as the reason, while about 40 per cent
indicated both reduced availability of funds and increased loan demand
(Table 6).

APPENDIX B: A COMPARISON OF THE FRB AND WHARTON
CAPACITY UTILIZATION SERIES*
The following table compares recent values of the quarterly
manufacturing capacity utilization series of the Federal Reserve Board
with the industrial (manufacturing, mining and utilities) utilization
series published by the Wharton School of Finance and Commerce.
FRB Manufacturing Wharton Industrial
Capacity Utilization Capacity Utilization
1966 -I 90.5 95.4
II 90.8 96.3

II 84.8 93.7
III 84.0 93.1
IV 84.2 93.7
1969 -I 84.4 94.1
It is evident that the Wharton index is generally higher
over this period, and that the difference is increasing. The 1967
decline was less severe in the Wharton figures and more of a recovery
has taken place since then. By the end of 1968 the Wharton rate was
3 points below its 1966 high, compared to over 6 points for the FRB
series.
The general level of the FRB series is controlled by the
results of an annual survey taken by McGraw-Hill Co. which asks manu-
facturing firms to state the per cent of their capacity which they were
operating at the end of the previous year. The most recent survey,
which has just become available, was in line with the FRB figures.
However, there are some reasons for thinking that current values of the
FRB series could be too low.
*Prepared by Jared J. Enzler, Economist, Division of Research and
Statistics.

B -2
(1) The FRB series depends heavily on a stable relation-
ship between capital output ratios and capacity.
Data by Kuznets has indicated that the capital output
ratio in the U.S. has declined slowly but steadily
since 1900. Since 1966 this relationship seems to
have reversed. The underlying reasons for the change
are apparently the investment tax credit and accel-
erated depreciation law of 1962, and the Long amendment
of 1964. These changes reduced the price of capital
relative to other factors of production and shifted
the desired capital output ratio. Some work done for the
FRB-MIT model suggests that a dollar of capital
expenditure since 1966 buys at least 10 per cent less
capacity than a 1958 dollar spent before that date.
The FRB series is constructed in such a way that this
shift, if it has really occurred, has been only partially
taken into account.
(2) Another possible source of bias is the sudden rise in
capital expenditures for computers. When IBM builds
a computer and rents it to an insurance company, the
computer is counted as part of the manufacturing
industry's capital stock. The rapid growth of this
practice since 1965 has inflated recent manufacturing
capital stock series and biased the capacity series.
It may be necessary to make an adjustment for this in
the next revision.
With regard to the problem of comparing the Wharton and FRB
series we first need a short description of the computation of the
Wharton series. Wharton in effect plots production series for each of
thrity industries included and then draws straight lines between periods
of peak output. These lines are held to represent capacity for their
respective industries. From these capacity lines and the production
series, utilization rates for each industry are calculated. A weighted
combination of these utilization rates gives the operating rate for the
industrial sector.
While such a procedure might appear to furnish only a crude
approximation, it has been pretty well thought out by the Wharton
people. However, it is well to keep in mind the following points:
(1) Levels of the Wharton and FRB series cannot be compared
directly. Since each peak production period is
regarded as 100 per cent utilization by Wharton, their
utilization rate is almost always well above the FRB
rate.

B -.3
(2) If the current quarter is not a "peak" quarter,
capacity is calculated by extrapolating the line
between the two previous "peaks". Eventually pro-
duction will exceed this extrapolated line and the
line will be tilted upward. Because of this,
current values of the Wharton index are always biased
upward and tend to be lowered by later data. These
revisions can be serious. For example, for the
first quarter of 1962 the initial Wharton estimate
of the utilization rate was 94. By 1968 the estimate
for the same quarter had been reduced to 82.8, a
reduction of over 10 points. While this is an
extreme case, it still indicates that current values
of the Wharton index are suspect.
(3) The practice of drawing straight arithmetic lines
between peaks causes an artifical decline in
estimated capacity growth rates and biases current
Wharton utilization rates upward. This is a serious
matter only if the interval between peaks is long.
Since for many industries the last two peaks were in
1959-60 and 1966, this has become an important source
of bias. This has been most significant in the
Wharton evaluation of capacity growth rates for
chemicals, nonelectrical, and electrical machinery.
(4) The Wharton series is calculated in such a way that
if output grows steadily at any positive growth rate
the Wharton utilization rate will eventually reach
100 per cent regardless of what happens to actual
capacity. For almost two years now the industrial
production has grown at a remarkably steady rate.
Despite the above, we cannot assert with confidence that
current Wharton utilization rates are too high, but past performance
suggests they will be revised downward to show a pattern more like the
present FRB series.

APPENDIX C: ADJUSTED OVER-ALL BALANCE
It has become increasingly evident that the two standard measures
of over-all surplus or deficit in the international transactions of the
United States--the liquidity balance and the balance settled by official
reserve transactions--are often very misleading indicators of changes in the
underlying trends of the international transactions of the United States.
Any such measure is, of course, an analytical abstraction that can not be
substituted for analyses that examine the structure of payments and receipts
and that take into account a wide range of circumstances and objectives.
Nevertheless, summary measures such as these make an impression on public
consciousness. It is important for policymakers to understand their peculi-
arities, and to be familiar with alternative measures that may in some respects
be superior to the standard measures.
Unlike other macro-measures, such as the Gross National Product, the
"balance" of a set of international transactions involves a selection rather
than a simple summation or averaging process. The difficulties and ambiguities
in doing this are described in some detail in the Report of the Review Committee
for Balance of Payments Statistics (Bernstein Report).
It should be emphasized that no one of the possible summations of
the balance of payments can in itself mesure an absolute degree of deviation
from some "equilibrium" position. For instance, U.S. payments deficits in
the period up to 1957 could have been quite consistent with long-run inter-
national equilibrium, had not important changes in international competitive
positions begun to develop in the mid-1950's. The variety of considerations
bearing on the question of equilibrium includes many factors not represented
in the international transactions accounts per se, and a wide array of infor-
mation needs to be taken into account in reaching judgments on that more general
issue. Nevertheless, a well-chosen summary measure of the balance of payments
can serve this important purpose: its changes over time ought to provide a
not-too-misleading starting point for discussion of whether the underlying
balance of payments position is changing in a desirable direction or not.
Both of the standard measures fall short of doing this satisfactorily.
The changes in net payments or receipts which they measure from quarter to
quarter are excessively influenced by large movements of certain types of funds.
In the case of the liquidity balance, as is well known, results depend
on a classification of U.S. liabilities into liquid and nonliquid liabilities.
Thus the measure can be affected, deliberately or otherwise, by changes in the
form rather than the substance of international assets or liabilities. Most
familiar is the transformation of foreign official accounts in the United
States into non-liquid claims by placing them in deposit accounts with an
original maturity of over one year. Other difficulties with this balance
arise because of the asymmetrical treatment of privately held assets and
Prepared by Samuel Pizer, Associate Adviser, Division of International Finance.

liabilities. For instance, by convention, deposits abroad of U.S. private
residents are not counted "below the line" though deposits of private foreigners
in U.S. commercial banks are so counted.
Similarly, the over-all balance settled by official reserve transac-
tions provides a poor starting point for analysis of underlying trends because
of the extreme variability introduced by large changes from quarter to quarter
in the flows of liquid funds to the United States through commercial banks
abroad. It should be borne in mind, too, that this measure has deficiencies
in terms of its own objectives. This measure is sometimes thought to reflect
the extent to which monetary authorities are gaining or losing international
reserves as the result of market forces. It is also assumed to be the indicator
used uniformly by monetary authorities to measure changes in their international
positions, and thus to insure consistent policy responses among countries. But
monetary authorities who intervene in forward markets or who use directives to
regulate the net foreign position of their commercial banks commonly count
changes in the net foreign position of the commercial banks of their countries
as part of their over-all view of their international reserve position. It is
hardly likely that a European central bank would act as if it had a deficit if
it was taking steps to reduce its holdings of dollars by inducing its commercial
banks to hold them.
For some time efforts have been made to derive measures of the over-all
payments position that sidestep some of the difficulties of the standard measures.
One approach has been to identify as "special" certain transactions involving
foreign official claims on the United States, and to adjust the two conventional
measures so as to eliminate the effect of such transactions. Usually, the
resulting measure has been called the liquidity balance before special transac-
tions. The thought behind this adjustment is that such "special" transactions
artifically obscure the state of affairs as reflected in all other international
transactions, and tend to show gains from time to time that are not supported
by underlying economic developments. Such an adjusted liquidity balance can be
derived from the data given in the regular quarterly articles on the balance of
payments published by the Commerce Department in the Survey of Current Business
and has also been used frequently--with some relatively minor differences--in
the Green Book.
Though the liquidity balance before special transactions has proved
to be a more stable indicator of changes in the underlying position than the
standard measures, it too presents some difficulties to the user. These
difficulties include the following:
(1) It is necessary to identify many transactions as "special," some
of which are recurrent or could be sustained for some time, while others are
one-time. Moreover, though all these transactions affect official reserves,
they differ greatly in size and significance. But obviously other official

actions through more general measures also affect reserve positions. The result
is that there are serious questions as to the analytical consistency involved in
this particular grouping of transactions, and a continuing debate among knowledge-
able users of the data as to the suitability of counting this or that item as
"special."
(2) The use of such a selected measure tends to focus attention on
so-called window-dressing operations, undermining unnecessarily the credibility
of the statements that are issued by the U.S. Government. Moreover, it is
very difficult to explain to less knowledgeable users what these adjustments
are all about.
(3) Data for some of the "special" transactions are not readily
available, and some are available only with a considerable lag if they are
derived from the Government transactions information gathered by the Office of
Business Economics. Also, the OBE accords different treatment to some items
(e.g., the German military offset arrangement) than has been done in the Green
Book tabulations, and in some instances the OBE does not publish precise infor-
mation because of confidentiality problems (e.g., the liquidation of the U.K.
portfolio).
(4) When certain items are identified as "special" the impression is
given that the remaining items are "regular" or basic. There are many other
temporary influences at work that ought to be allowed for in a reasonably
complete analysis, but this partial selection may divert attention from the
need for a further search for such "special" factors. That is, the name given
to this balance gives a spurious notion of the extent of the analysis that is
involved in its creation.
An attempt is being made in this Green Book (and was made in the April
Federal Reserve Bulletin) to derive a measure of changes in the over-all balance
that avoids some of these difficulties, though it, in turn, is not to be taken
as a substitute for analysis. For want of a better name, this is called the
"adjusted over-all balance." It may be considered to measure the net sum of
all international transactions other than (1) changes in international reserves
of the United States, and (2) changes in U.S. liabilities to foreign official
reserve holdings and to foreign commercial banks (including foreign branches
of U.S. banks). In other words, this is the balance measured by, and financed
by, the sum of official settlements and changes in bank-reported liabilities to
foreign commercial banks. (The latter includes only liabilities reported by
U.S. banks; it does not include any liabilities to foreign banks appearing only
in the accounts of U.S. non-banks.)
For purposes of comparison, the table that follows gives the over-all
balance as measured by four different concepts quarterly for the past several
years. Two variants of the adjusted over-all balance are presented, one differing

from the other by counting as financing items the advance repayments of U.S.
postwar loans and the liquidation of the U.K. official portfolio of U.S.
securities.
The new measure, introduced here on a still experimental basis, has
some advantages that are the counterparts of the difficulties of the other
balances mentioned above:
(1) it is simple to construct from readily available data, and to
explain to the public;
(2) it does not undergo large changes from quarter to quarter due
solely to nominal changes in the degree of liquidity of officially held assets,
or because of changes in the pace or the direction of switches in dollar claims
on the United States between foreign central banks and foreign commercial banks;
(3) it avoids controversies over the nature of "special" transactions;
(4) it can readily be modified, if desired, to take account of specific
official transactions such as debt prepayments--but the possible desirability of
inserting such modifications points up the fact that this measure, like the others,
is much too selective to be substituted for analysis;
(5) it places all transactions of international lending institutions
with the United States above the line, which has the desirable effect of not
contributing to enlarge the deficit whenever one of these institutions
borrows in the United States and deposits the proceeds in a U.S. bank pending
disbursement;
(6) it does not count as an element contributing to deficits an
increase in liquid claims on the United States by private foreigners other
than commercial banks, so that an increase in working balances held by such
non-residents is regarded as a capital inflow rather than as a financing item.
As noted above, this adjusted measure is being introduced on an
experimental basis; whether it is retained or not will depend on whether it
turns out to be useful as a means of conveying succinctly the over-all course
of U.S. international transactions. The other measures will also continue to
be used, though perhaps with a heightened awareness of their significance.
