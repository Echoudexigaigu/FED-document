SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK
Outlook for economic activity
The pace of real growth appears to have edged down further
in the quarter just ending, to a little under a 2-1/2 per cent annual
rate. Assuming extension of the surtax, available evidence continues
to suggest a further slowing in the rate of real growth in the second
half of the year to about a 1 -1-1/2 per cent annual rate. There was
apparently no diminution in price pressures, in the second quarter as
measured by the GNP implicit deflator, and only a modest abatement is
anticipated for the second half of the year.
The projected further slowing in economic activity reflects
in large part a sharp deceleration from the recent rapid rate of growth
of business spending for fixed capital, as indicated in the most recent
Commerce-SEC survey. Demands in other key sectors of final sales are
likely to be either less expansive or no more so than over the past two
quarters. Consumer spending has shown little buoyancy in recent months,
although auto sales have strengthened in the past few weeks. And further
growth in consumption is likely to be held down, on balance, in the second
half of the year, when employment and income gains in private sectors are
projected to be smaller than in the second quarter. However, in the third
quarter, growth in disposable personal income and consumption will be
lifted temporarily by the Federal pay raise and the end of payments on
last year's tax obligations.

I-2
Residential construction activity turned down in May in lagged
response to the drop in starts since January. Further tightening in
the availability of mortgage funds and record mortgage interest rates are
likely to result in some further reduction in starts, although the de-
cline may be limited by the very large volume of outstanding lender
commitments. Meanwhile, Federal Government expenditures are expected
to be edging down apart from the July 1 pay raise.
Outlook for resource use and prices
Industrial production is now tentatively estimated to be up
at an annual rate of 6 per cent in the second quarter, about in line
with growth in capacity. Expansion in industrial production this year
has been heavily dependent on a sharp advance in the business equipment
sector and in related materials industries. In the second half of 1969,
with the projected deceleration in growth of real GNP and of fixed capital
spending, the rise in industrial production is expected to slacken
markedly, with little advance in the fourth quarter. Manufacturing
capacity is estimated to increase almost as much over 1969 as the 6 per
cent expansion of 1968, and the capacity utilization rate would decline
from its recent plateau of around 84.5 per cent.
In contrast to industrial production, growth in nonfarm employ-
ment has moderated considerably in the past 3 months and the unemployment
rate has edged up to 3.5 per cent. The current GNP projection implies a
marked further slowing of growth in nonfarm employment in the second half

I-3
of the year. Even on the assumption incorporated in the projection that
growth in the labor force would be far smaller than normal, the unemploy-
ment rate appears likely to move up and at year-end may be close to 4 per
cent. An early test of strength in the labor market will come this spring
and summer with the usual influx of young people.
Pressures on prices remain strong, but are expected to ease
somewhat by year end. This judgment represents a net balancing of the
strong and persistent increases in costs, whose momentum cannot be stopped
quickly, and the weakening anticipated for demands and resource use. On
the cost side, while recent wage settlements have been very large
(especially in construction), the overall rise in labor compensation
has edged off somewhat this year and is likely to ease further as
collective bargaining activity remains at a fairly low level. But pro-
ductivity gains in the nonfarm economy also have slowed, and further
easing--particularly in manufacturing where recent gains have apparently
been large--seems likely to accompany moderation in output gains.
The consumer price index probably increased considerably
further in May as the very sharp rise in wholesale meat prices was
partly carried through to retail prices; a further rise in meat prices
probably occurred this month. Most recently, livestock prices have
stabilized at very high levels, but it may be late sumer before increased
marketings bring prices down, A leveling off in mortgage interest costs
could also exert a slowing influence as the summer progresses.

I-4
Prices of industrial commodities again showed only a small
increase to mid-May as substantial increases in metals and machinery
prices were largely offset by a further sharp drop in lumber and plywood.
Prices of important steel products and nonferrous metals have been in-
creased further since mid-May. Looking ahead, strong demands abroad
may maintain price pressures on key materials, despite an easing in
domestic demands.
Demands for funds
With liquidity positions of nonfinancial corporations reduced
and corporate uses of funds continuing to exceed internal sources by a
wide margin, business demands for credit are likely to remain relatively
strong into the summer. Recentlythere have been reports of new bond
offerings by a scattering of major industrial corporations. But no
sizable rush to the bond market appears in the offing, since many
economic forecasters are anticipating an appreciable net decline of
bond yields by year-end.
In these cirsumstances, the prevailing squeeze on corporate
financial positions will continue to require active business borrowing
at commercial banks and in the commercial paper market, although the
strength of even these demands should moderate somewhat now that the
second quarter bulge in tax payments is past. Most recently the cost of
commercial paper to business borrowers has again moved up sharply. If
this cost should climb significantly above the 8-1/2 per cent prime rate,

I -5
relatively heavy borrowing demands at banks rather than in the open
market could be expected.
Federal credit demands, on balance, are projected to be
fairly substantial during the summer. New cash raised by the Treasury
should be significantly smaller than in third quarters of other recent
years. But borrowing demands generated by Federal programs now outside
the Budget are likely to be considerably larger. In particular, the
combined new money requirements of the Federal Home Loan Banks and FNMA
could range from $1.5 to $2.0 billion. This would be in addition to
large liquid asset sales by the Home Loan Banks.
In the case of State and local governments, demands on bond
markets have been running at a substantially reduced volume in June
and seem likely to remain unusually low in July as well. While these
cutbacks reflect postponements and cancellations of new issues, total
borrowing by State and local governments is not being reduced
commensurately, because borrowers are shifting much of their demands to
short-term market through temporary financing in tax exempt notes.
Supply of funds
By paying record interest rates, commercial banks managed to
obtain sufficient funds from Euro-dollar and other nondeposit sources
to weather the initial tax date squeeze. With the tax date behind us,
the next critical test for financial markets will be provided by the
month-end interest and dividend crediting period at savings institutions.

I -6
Nonbank thrift institutions are approaching this test quite
cautiously. While recent experience has amply demonstrated the lower
interest rate sensitivity of savers who have remained with thrift
institutions, the recent quantum jump in short-term interest rates may
highlight the current relative attractiveness of market yields. This,
together with attrition in the sizable volume of maturing 3-year bonus
account certificates that had been issued at premium rates by California
savings and loans in the third quarter of 1966 before rate controls were
instituted, could result in savings outflows considerably larger than
those experienced in 1968 and approaching the 1966 record.
At commercial banks, consumer-type time and savings deposits
are also expected to show a substantial decline during the reinvestment
period. And the advanced level of interest rates will force continuing
rapid attrition in negotiable CD's as well. With total demand deposits
also projected to show little or no increase on average, banks are likely
to be reluctant lenders and will probably be forced to continue to scramble
actively for funds from nondeposit sources.
Under these circumstances, credit conditions in mortgage
markets should tighten further as thrift institutions become much more
cautious in making new mortgage commitments and commercial banks continue
cutting back on construction lending. Also, minicipal bond yields are
likely to be subject to addition upward pressure due to the continued
squeeze on banks. The outlook for yields on taxable bonds is more

I- 7
doubtful. Corporate bond yields may now be at or close to their peaks,
although the high level of yields may persist into the summer in view
of the sizable new issue calendar expected for July.
Balance of payments outlook
In the past eight or nine weeks changes in current transactions
and in the more familiar kinds of capital movements have been over-
shadowed by what appears to be a wave of transfers of funds from the United
States, for a while (up to May 9) into German mark assets and claims
and more recently into high-yielding Euro-dollar deposits. So far in
June the balance on the liquidity basis has remained in heavy deficit.
On the official settlements basis, however, there has been a very large
surplus.
The liabilities of banks in the United States to commercial
banks abroad, including liabilities to branches, have increased since
January 1 by more than $7 billion. In the five weeks to Monday June 16
the increase exceeded $4 billion. Although a contribution apparently
was made to this figure by funds flowing from the United States (and
then back to U.S. banks), the shrinking of U.S. liabilities to foreign
official reserve holders gives evidence that large movements of private
funds out of other currencies into Euro-dollar deposits (or into re-
payment of Euro-dollar loans) have also been occurring, as U.S. banks
have bid actively for Euro-dollars through their branches. During
recent weeks flows from Germany to the Euro-dollar market were very

I -8
large. There are indications that relatively large movements--relative,
that is, to the size of the financial markets concerned--have come from
Belgium, the Netherlands, Sweden, and France; also Japanese borrowings
of Euro-dollars have been reduced.
Improvement in the liquidity balance may now depend on
cessation (or reversal) of the flows of nonbank funds from the
United States that have been helping to feed the Euro-dollar market,
and this in turn may depend on developments affecting U.S. banks'
demands for Euro-dollars. Whether repayments of the U.S. banks' Euro-
dollar borrowings would be accompanied mainly by improvement of the
liquidity balance (through a flow of nonbank funds to the United States)
or by a worsening of the official settlements balance (through flows
from the Euro-dollar market into other currencies) is debatable; mid-
year windowdressing by European banks would tend to have the latter
effect. If speculation on a mark revaluation, now dormant, should
revive, the balance on both bases might be adversely affected.
The U,S, merchandise trade picture remains obscure; especially
unclear for the near-term future is the size of the backlogs of delayed
exports and imports still to be worked off. A little further ahead we
still expect exports to rise more than imports. With respect to the in-
flow of foreign capital to buy U.S, corporate stocks, data for March
and April show a marked slowing. Whether this has since led to net
liquidations is not known--this could be one source of funds to the Euro-
dollar market. In any case it is presumed that inflows in the near future
will not be large, assuming a continuation of recent weakness in the stock
market.

THE ECONOMIC PICTURE IN DETAIL
The Nonfinancial Scene
Gross national product. Total spending for goods and services
is now estimated to rise in the current quarter by about $15 billion,
only a little less than the increase in the first quarter. But with
prices continuing to move up at a rapid pace, a further dip in growth
of real GNP appears likely--to about a 2.3 per cent annual rate, from
2.8 per cent in the first quarter. The rise in current dollar GNP in
the third quarter will probably be sustained by the Federal pay raise
and its stimulative effect on consumer spending. Assuming prompt ex-
tension of the surcharge, monetary and fiscal restraints should reduce
income flows and expenditures significantly further by the fourth
quarter, and the rise in final sales is expected to drop to $10 billion--
about half that in the first quarter. Growth in real GNP is projected
to slow to an annual rate of around 1.0 per cent and some moderation in
the rate of price advance is projected.
The rise in GNP now expected in the current quarter is somewhat
larger than projected earlier, mainly because of the changed pattern of
business plant and equipment expenditure plans this year as shown by the
April-May Commerce-SEC survey. In the first quarter, according to this
survey, capital spending rose much less than had been indicated earlier;
and plans for the second quarter now suggest that such outlays will rise
about as rapidly as in the first, rather than declining a bit as earlier

II -2
plans had indicated. However business fixed investment in the GNP accounts
covers a broader area of expenditures and is not likely to rise quite
as much in the current quarter as in the first. Although there will be
no revision in the official Commerce GNP estimates until July, the first
quarter GNP figures shown in the accompanying tables incorporate staff
adjustments to reflect the spending pattern indicated by this new survey
as well as some other later information. The overall GNP total remains
unchanged; most of the downward adjustment in business fixed investment
is offset by an upward revision in inventory investment and in net exports.
In addition to the rise in fixed capital spending, GNP growth
was helped in the second quarter by a rise in net exports of goods and
services following the end of the dock workers' strike. However, there
have been indications of further easing in several key sectors. Retail
sales in May were virtually unchanged from April--although unit sales of
new autos were up some. May retailsales were only moderately higher than
last September and in real terms they were probably no higher than a year
earlier. New residential housing starts have moved down fairly sharply
since the beginning of the year, and in May at 1.5 million units, annual
rate, they were a fifth per cent below their January peak. Both residential
construction expenditures and employment are beginning to reflect this
decline. Total nonfarm employment in recent months has risen much less
rapidly than during the winter. And the limited data available on
inventory developments, mainly for April, suggest the likelihood of a

II -3
continued moderate accumulation this quarter at about the first quarter
rate.
A further slowing in the expansion of overall activity by the
end of the year is suggested by both the sharp deceleration in the rise
in capital spending planned for the last half of the year and the
stringent Federal government budget expenditure limitations in prospect.
According to the recent plant and equipment survey, business fixed
investment will rise only about 2 per cent in the third quarter and less
than 1 per cent in the fourth, as compared with 4.5 per cent in each of
the first two quarters. This survey was taken after the announced
proposal to repeal the investment tax credit, but it is doubtful that
spending plans for the remainder of this year were apppreciably reduced;
the repeal of the investment stimulant is expected to have the bulk of
its effects on outlays in subsequent years.
Although activity in a number of sectors should be easing
further, GNP growth in the third quarter may equal the $15 billion
second quarter rise. The Federal pay raise totaling $2.8 billion and
the reduction in Federal tax payments following final settlements,
including the retroactive portion of the tax surcharge, will boost
spendable income substantially. A sizable increase in consumer spending
is thus projected for the third quarter, though it will probably be a
little less than the rise in income. But with employment growth con-
tinuing to slow, and with the saving rate already at a relatively low
rate, growth in consumption expenditures in the fourth quarter is projected

II -4
to ease significantly, rising about in line with the reduced rise of
income. In addition, Federal outlays should be inching downward,
assuming stringent budgetary controls, and little rebound in residential
construction activity seems possible even though housing starts are
projected to bottom out.
We are projecting little change in overall inventory
accumulation in the third quarter, given the expected growth in
final sales. But some increase in the rate of accumulation is probable
in the fourth quarter as expansion of final demands eases considerably,
With business fixed investment, residential construction, Federal govern-
ment purchases, and consumption rising more slowly--or declining--growth
in final sales in the fourth quarter is expected to decline from $15
billion to a $10 billion rate.
The rise in the budget surplus of $7 billion (NIA basis) in
the first quarter undoubtedly was a significant factor in helping to
slow the rate of increase in real activity. Heavy tax receipts in this
quarter just ending probably boosted the surplus to about a $9 billion,
annual rate. The surplus is projected to dip to an average of about
$5.5 billion in the last two quarters of 1969.

Industrial production. Industrial production in May was
172.8 per cent of the 1957-59 average--up 0.6 per cent from the upward
revised April figure and up 5.2 per cent from a year earlier. If the
index registers a similar gain in June, as now appears likely, production
in the second quarter would have increased at a 6.2 per cent annual
rate, as compared with a 6.6 per cent rate from the fourth quarter of
1968 to the first quarter of 1969.
As in April, the May rise was concentrated in output of
business equipment and industrial materials. Production of consumer
goods leveled off following a decline in April. Auto assemblies were
about unchanged from the reduced April level as strikes continued
through most of May. With most of the General Motors strikes settled
by the end of the month, output in the first two weeks in June rose to
an annual rate of 8.5 million units from 7.6 million in May. Among
other consumer goods, production of television sets declined further
in May and output of most other products changed little at advanced
levels.
Production of industrial and commercial equipment increased
further and so far this year has risen at an annual rate of 11 per
cent. On the other hand, output of freight and passenger and farm
equipment has been about unchanged since the beginning of the year.
Production of iron and steel rose again in May and output of
construction materials was maintained. Production of most textile and
paper products, however, changed little. Revised data for industrial

II -8
chemical production indicate a marked growth in output since January--
a 9 per cent annual rate--in contrast to the leveling off shown by
earlier figures.
Retail sales. Retail sales in May were virtually unchanged
from April, according to the advance report, suggesting continuance of
the less exuberant consumer buying attitude that began last fall. Sales
of durable goods stores increased modestly from April, largely as a
result of considerable strength in the lumber, building material, and
hardware group. The automotive group was virtually unchanged from the
previous month despite a rise in unit sales of new cars. Sales of
furniture and appliance stores declined. Sales of nondurable goods
stores were unchanged from April.
Department stores showed a 2 per cent decline in May after
surging 5 per cent in April. In terms of year-over-year comparisons,
however, department stores in May, with a gain of 11 per cent, continued
to out perform retail stores as a whole, which excluding department
stores were only 3.9 per cent higher than in May 1968.
In May, sales of domestic cars rose moderately to a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 8.5 million units, 2 per cent below a year earlier.
Sales of imported cars were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.1
million units, an increase of 19 per cent over a year ago. Sales of new
domestic autos rose further in the first 10 days of June to a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of well over 9 million units, a 12 per cent increase

II -9
from last year. Part of the early June surge in sales reflected
settlement of several of the strikes that idled 7 General Motors plants
in May; strong post-introductory sales of the new Ford Maverick line
also boosted the total. Stocks of new domestic autos on June 1 were
reduced to less than 1.7 million units, and the seasonally adjusted
stock/sales ratio dipped to 54 days' supply from 59 days in April and
60 in March.

Consumer credit. Increases in outstanding consumer instalment
credit have shown considerable month-to-month fluctuation since last
summer, but a diminishing rate of gain is clear when the figures are
grouped in two-month intervals. Average monthly increases, at seasonally

II -10
adjusted annual rates, have declined from about $10 billion in the
September-October 1968 period to less than $8-1/2 billion in March-
April this year.
The pattern is less well defined among major types of
instalment credit within the total, partly because of distortions
in car sales resulting from the strike by longshoremen and also be-
cause of a rise in personal loans in April that probably reflected
larger final payments on income taxes due this year. However, each of
the major groups shows smaller increases in the most recent two-month
period than in the latter part of 1968.

increased in April at close to the first-quarter average monthly rate.
With prices continuing to rise rapidly, it is probable that the valua-
tion adjustment will again be relatively large in the second quarter,

II -11
so that the April figures are consistent with a continuation of
inventory accumulation (GNP basis) at about the first quarter rate.

The May survey of manufacturers' expectations indicates that
durable goods manufacturers expect their inventories to rise at a
monthly average rate of over $550 million this quarter, while non-
durable goods manufacturers expect to continue their April rate of
inventory accumulation. Both anticipate some increase in their
inventory-sales ratio by June, as a result of a relatively small
prospective rise in sales. For the third quarter, manufacturers
anticipate continuation of this rate of increase in book value of
inventories along with a somewhat larger sales increase than in the
second quarter, resulting in no further change in the anticipated
inventory-sales ratio.

II -12
These anticipations do not seem out of line with the current
position of inventories and orders. Further increases in production
and inventories of business equipment, materials, and components seem
assured by recent levels of orders. Defense products inventories will
probably continue to change little; they are at advanced levels, relative
to shipments and unfilled orders, but judging by past performance they
are not likely to decline until the order backlog declines, and at the
end of April the defense products backlog was at a new high.
Plant and equipment. Business plans for fixed capital
expenditures this year have been revised downward from those reported
three months ago, according to the Commerce-SEC survey conducted in
late April and May. Current plans call for a 12.6 per cent increase
in spending over 1968; the earlier survey had indicated a 13.9 per cent
increase.
Although this change in magnitude is slight, there is a
significant modification of the profile of expenditures within the
year. In the earlier survey, there was an extremely sharp increase
in the first quarter (which has now been almost halved), a slight dip
in the second, and a moderate gain thereafter. In the current survey,
expenditures show sizable increases in both the first and second
quarters, and successively smaller gains in the third and fourth. For
the fourth quarter of 1969, the rise in outlays is expected to be at

II -13
an annual rate of only 3 per cent, compared to rates of about 18 per
cent in each of the first two quarters.
Another indication that capital spending is slowing is the
recent National Industrial Conference Board survey of new capital
appropriations of 1,000 manufacturers which shows a decline from
$6.76 billion in the fourth quarter of 1968 to $6.60 billion in
the first quarter of 1969. At the same time, both current expendi-
tures and unspent backlogs of already appropriated funds rose.
Backlogs would sustain activity for 3.3 quarters at the first quarter
spending rate, i.e., until January 1970. This figure had been running
at an average of 3.7 quarters in recent years and was as high as
3.9 quarters in the second quarter of 1968.

Construction and real estate. Outlays for new construction,
changed very little in May and, at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
$90.9 billion, were below the peak reached last January. With the year-
to-year rise in construction costs continuing at about 8 per cent, such
outlays in real terms also remained below a year earlier.

II -15
Reflecting the downtrend in housing starts since January,
current dollar outlays for residential construction declined in May.
While outlays for private nonresidential construction apparently held
at the advanced April rate, they were appreciably below the peak
earlier this year. Public construction outlays edged upward in May,
but also remained below the high established last November.

1/ Seasonally adjusted annual rates; preliminary. Data for the most
recent month (May) are confidential Census Bureau extrapolations. In
no case should public reference be made to them.
Seasonally adjusted private housing starts in May continued
downward for the fourth consecutive month to an annual rate of 1.51
million, about in line with projections. Unlike most other recent
months, single family starts rose markedly. Multifamily starts, on the
other hand, showed a sharp decline though they still accounted for more
than two-fifths of the total. Regionally, starts in all areas except
the South pointed lower.

II -16
A "fillip" in the volatile starts series cannot be ruled out
in June when builders in a position to do so may attempt to accelerate
schedules again in the wake of the uncertainties caused by the further
tightening in financial markets early this month. However, given the
pronounced drop in permits reported for May and other factors, the June
rate may at best hold at about the May level. This would bring the
second quarter average to about 1.52 million--well below the 1.72
million annual rate now reported for the first quarter of the year,
and about the same as the average for the year 1968.

While increased financial market pressures have continued to
dampen builders' initial expectations for activity this year, basic
shelter demands have remained very strong. Both rental and home-owner
vacancy rates in the first quarter were the lowest for any first
quarter since 1957 and sharply lower than at the same time in 1966 when
supplies available from earlier "overbuilding" were still a significant
market factor.

Labor market. Signs of easier labor demand were again apparent
in May but the overall labor market remained on the tight side. Over
the past 3 months, the growth of nonfarm payroll employment--92,000 in
May--has slackened to about one-third of the very rapid pace that had

II -18
prevailed from September to February. The rise in joblessness thus far
has been moderate -from 3.3 per cent of the labor force last winter
to 3.5 per cent in both April and May. Slower employment growth and a
lower rate of increase of hourly earnings have reduced the growth rate
of personal income somewhat.
Although signs of moderation have been in evidence for 3
months, there have been no indications of any significant layoffs
and insured unemployment continues very low. June and July should
bring a test of the strength of underlying labor demand as several
million high school and college students enter the market in search
of summer or permanent jobs.
Employment and hours. The slowing of employment growth has
been widely distributed, although a big swing in construction employ-
ment--off 32,000 in May, in part reflecting strikes--from strong growth
last fall to declines this spring played a large part in the slowdown
of total job growth. In May, construction employment was still 144,000
above a year ago.
Manufacturing employment has grown slowly since February after
expanding at a rate of 60,000 a month between September and February.
Gains have continued in capital-goods industries but at slower rates in
recent months. Employment has shown little change in most consumer-
goods and defense industries.

Employment advances in the nonindustrial sector have also
become spotty in recent months and gains are averaging about half the
size of those late last year. Among private services, only medical
and other health services have continued to register large gains, while
growth has slowed in business and personal services. State and local
government hiring has slowed in recent months, and, reflecting budget
and hiring restraints, Federal employment has been comparatively stable
since February after declining somewhat in the last half of 1968. Trade
employment remains relatively strong, despite some signs of weakness in
retail sales.
During the September-February period of rapid employment
growth, manufacturers reduced the workweek somewhat. However, over
the past 3 months, average hours have held firm (at a high 40.8 hours)

II -20
as net additions to payrolls edged down. Thus, demand for labor
appears to have leveled off on a high plateau in recent months after
rising strongly in late 1968.
Wages and income. Average hourly earning increases have
eased somewhat since late last year. In the organized sector, a
reduced number of collective bargaining situations combined with a
large number of smaller second and third year wage increases specified
in earlier settlements served to moderate the rate of increase of
average hourly earnings. Nevertheless, the underlying upward pressure
on wage rates persists.

Contracts negotiated with construction, maritime, cement and
airline unions in recent months have involved first-year wage increases
in the 8 to 10 per cent range, up from an average of 7-1/2 per cent in
1968. More importantly, these contracts include somewhat larger second
and third year increases than were granted in the big industrial contracts
of 1967-68, suggesting increased efforts to protect wage gains from
possible price erosion in the future.

II -21
With employment growth off sharply and wage increases somewhat
smaller, gains in gross wage and salary payments were reduced to about
$2-1/2 billion in April and May from average monthly increments of
$3-1/2 billion over the year ending in March 1969. Although the growth
rate of income flows from nonwage sources has continued high, April and
May increases in personal income averaged about one-fifth less than the
monthly average from March 1968 through March 1969.

Wholesale prices. The WPI rose by 0.8 per cent from mid-April
to mid-May, mainly because of an exceptionally large rise in farm and
food products. Prices of industrial commodities rose only 0.1 per cent,
following a similarly small rise in March. Increases in metals and
machinery prices were relatively large, exceeding those in April, but
a further decline in prices of lumber and plywood dampened the in-
dustrial advance and also helped to push the sensitive materials index
lower again.

II -22
The May rise in farm and food products prices of 2.9 per cent
was the largest since February 1951, and reflected large increases in
livestock and meats, in fruits and vegetables, and a rise in the price
of corn. Livestock prices increased 8 per cent from mid-April to mid-
May, (and the price of beef reached a 17-year high) while meat prices
at wholesale rose almost as fast. Production of red meat this year has
been above the record levels of 1968 except in the last four to six
weeks, when it has been a little below. However, per capita con-
sumption in the first quarter was about the same as last year because
imports were restricted by the dock strike. With consumer demand for
meat, especially for beef, at record levels, the volume of marketings
and imports has been insufficient to prevent a sharp spurt in prices.
Since mid-May, livestock prices initially rose somewhat further,
but more recently have been on a high plateau. The Department of
Agriculture thinks most of the bulge in animal and meat prices at
wholesale is behind us. However, retail meat prices probably rose
strongly in May and are expected to increase further this month.
Poor weather conditions were mainly responsible for the
large increase in vegetable prices in May. Egg prices dropped
sharply.
Among industrial commodities, increases were slightly less
numerous in May than in the previous months of this year, and there
were about the same percentage of decreases. Of the major groups,
plywood and wood products dropped sharply further; textiles and

II -23
rubber products also decreased. Nonferrous metals continued to rise
strongly in May, as did iron and steel and their products. Since mid-
May, further increases for these two groups have been announced.
Machinery and equipment prices generally rose further in May.

almost as much in the last two months and in May were 4 per cent above

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL SITUATION
Bank credit. Expansion of total loans and investments at
all commercial banks in May dropped back to about the low first
quarter rate, following the April surge associated with Treasury
financing and borrowing for tax payments. Business loan demand
remained heavy in May and total bank loans continued to grow at a
rapid rate. But with deposits under continued pressure, banks also
reduced sharply further their holdings of securities, and more banks
initiated financing arrangements outside the scope of Regulations D
and Q--particularly the issuance of commercial paper through holding
companies and the sale of loans.

Banks liquidated $1.8 billion of securities in May--about
90 per cent of which were Governments--following substantial reductions
earlier in the year. As has been the case since year-end, the
recent liquidation of Governments at weekly reporting banks was
confined largely to issues maturing with in one year. Reductions in
holdings of other securities continued to be in both long- and short-
term municipals. Recent declines in holdings of long-term municipals
have been in line with reductions earlier in the year and data are
not available to distinguish whether these represent actual sales or
simply attrition resulting from failure to replace maturing issues.
The continued rapid expansion of bank loans in May and early
June reflected in large part further heavy borrowing by business,
as growth in real estate loans slowed and consumer loans maintained
approximately the reduced rate of growth of recent months. May
expansion in business loans, even with a substantial volume of loan
sales by banks excluded, continued at around the 16 per cent annual
rate prevailing since last fall. While these increases probably
reflected in good part financing of inventory accumulation--and are
generally consistent with the inventory investment projected for the
second quarter--some of the recent rise also represented diversion
of demand from the commercial paper market prior to the increase
in prime rate to 8-1/2 per cent in early June. As in April,
the increases in business loans in May and early June were large at
both New York and outside banks and were fairly widespread among
industry categories. Increases earlier in the year and in late 1968

III -3
had been concentrated at banks outside of New York and within a relatively
few industry categories.
Bank deposits. Time and savings deposits at all commercial
banks declined further in May, reflecting continued CD attrition,
which was offset only in part by an unusually small rise in consumer-
type deposits. Outstanding negotiable CD's at all large banks fell
by nearly $1 billion in May and in the first week in June, and New
York and Chicago banks lost another $150 million in the following
week. This brought the total decline since December 11 to about
$7.8 billion, or almost one-third of outstanding CD's at that time.
Consequently, banks with foreign branches continued to borrow
heavily in the Euro-dollar market, and bank liabilities to foreign
branches rose by nearly $600 million during May and by an additional
$2 billion in the first two weeks in June.

Consumer-type time and savings deposits at large banks
declined slightly further in May, following the substantial decline
in April attributable to quarterly interest crediting. Although
these banks began to experience moderate inflows in early June, the
recovery has taken much longer and has been much smaller than during
comparable post-interest crediting periods in the past, probably
reflecting the diversion of funds to market instruments in view
of further increases in market rates. Large banks in New York City
sustained most of the recent losses--mainly in time certificates
and open accounts. Consumer-type deposits at large banks outside
New York and time and savings deposits at country banks both
increased, although much less than usual, in May and early June.
The money stock, measured on a daily average basis, declined
at a 2.5 per cent annual rate in May. For the first five months of the
year the money stock rose at only a 2.7 per cent annual rate. Although
a somewhat lower average volume of stock market activity and a $1.7
billion increase in U.S. Government deposits over this 5-month period
may have contributed to this reduced rate of growth, it is likely
that the principle source of the slowdown has been the increased
pressure on bank reserve positions that has raised market rates of
interest and has induced additional economies in the management of
money balances.

III -5
Nonbank depositary intermediaries. Inflows to mutual savings
banks approached those a year earlier during May and apparently in early
June. After the prime rate increase, however, New York City savings
banks actually lost funds after allowance for passbook loans. Looking
at combined April-May patterns, it is clear that the mutuals deposit
growth had slowed noticeably. We unfortunately have no information
on inflows to the savings and loan associations in May, but expect to
have it for the Supplement. Savings and loan associations, however,
did increase their borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank System
during May by a relatively large $300 million.

In reaction to the prime rate increase, the intermediaries
are reported to be preparing for relatively heavy outflows in the
coming reinvestment period and to be acting with increasing caution
on new mortgage commitments. In June, the FHLBB took steps to
increase the associations' funds available for mortgages. The
required level of liquidity holdings was reduced from 6.5% to 6% of
share capital--which is equivalent to freeing $650 million from
cash and Government holdings. In addition, the Government securities
suitable for liquid holdings have been redefined to include certain
Agency issues. On the other hand, the Board has requested member
S&L's to meet out of liquid reserves withdrawals amounting to 1
per cent of share capital, instead of one-half per cent, before
applying for withdrawal advances. The FHLBB continues its lenient
stance in granting advances for expansion purposes, however, and those
loans often substitute for withdrawal advances.
Policy loans and life insurance companies. The net increase
in policy loans at life insurance companies during May continued at
the near-record level of the previous month. Policy loan activity this
year to date has, as expected, absorbed a record amount from the
investment funds of insurance companies. The industry expects continued
large policy loan volume, and apparently has remained well prepared
for the current experience. In contrast to the pattern earlier this
year, but in line with 1966 experience, an important share of pollcy
loan activity now is reported to be relatively large business borrowing
in response to the reductions in credit available from normal channels.

Mortgage market. Following the recent hike in the bank prime
rate, home mortgage lenders apparently became still more selective,
particularly in view of large backlogs of outstanding mortgage commit-
ments and the approaching mid-year savings reinvestment period. These
and other developments suggest a further reduction in residential
mortgage credit availability this month. Even before the prime rate
increase, FHA field offices had reported that funds available for FHA-
insured home mortgages had declined to the lowest level of the year.
As general credit conditions have tightened in recent weeks,
average yields in the secondary market for Government-underwritten
home mortgages have turned up again. In the June 16 weekly FNMA
auction--the first since the latest bank prime rate increase--yields

on FNMA's 6-month forward purchase commitments jumped as much as 25
basis points to reach a new high for the year. Meanwhile, FNMA
resources have come under growing pressure as FNMA borrowing costs
have continued to increase faster than its portfolio earnings.
Reflecting this and other pressures, FNMA, since mid-May, has
expanded the weekly supply of its commitments much 1

In view of the prime rate increase, trade expectations are
for still higher mortgage returns in the period immediately ahead.
There has also been growing talk about the possibility of another
upward revision in the 7-1/2 per cent regulatory ceiling on FHA
and VA mortgage rates, as sharply higher discounts on these loans
have become a barrier to market transactions. From April to May,
however, average yields required by lenders in both primary and secondary
market were unchanged for new-home mortgages, and yield spreads over
corporate bonds remained relatively unattractive.

Corporate security and municipal bond markets. Increased
market emphasis on the degree of monetary restraint--with particular
attention to the prime rate and soaring short-term money market rates--
produced a rapid deterioration in both the stock and bond markets after
mid-May. By mid-June, average stock prices had declined by about 7 per
cent from month-earlier levels, falling in the case of some indices,
from near highs for the year to new 1969 lows./ Long-term bond yields
in municipal and corporate markets have increased from 50 to 70 basis
points since mid-May, while short-term market yields had risen from 50 to
100 basis points; at current levels, most market yields are at all time
highs.
1/ With the volume of stocks not delivered by the end of the settlement
period apparently continuing relatively low in May, with improvement
in the New York Stock Exchange's Central Certificate Service, and with
volume considerably below past highs, the Exchanges have petitioned
the SEC to extend daily trading hours from 4 hours to 4-1/2 hours,
still below the traditional 5-1/2 hour trading day.

Deterioration in the markets for municipal bonds and short-
term notes has been particularly sharp. Long-term offerings in June
are estimated to have sharply declined to $600 million and--with little
relief from pressures in sight--July volume will probably be about
the same. Such a reduced volume over two consecutive months would
represent the most substantial reduction in long-term issue volume
in the postwar period. Even with the low volume in June, dealers
found it necessary to price reofferings at sharply increasing yields
to attract casualty insurance company and individual investors to
replace bank buyers. Moreover, sizeable week-to-week price declines
produced large dealer losses, and, with dealer financing costly, not
only did underwriters bid very cautiously but the number of syndicates
willing to bid for specific issues also declined,

Not all of the June decline in long-term tax-exempt offerings
reflected the increase in announced postponements; many issuers did
not even advertise sales in the rapidly declining bond market. Post-
ponements, cancellations, and reduced offerings apparently reflected
not only the effect of interest cost ceilings, but also some speculation
on future improvement in the market.
In order to maintain their expenditure plans, issuers have
apparently offset a sizeable proportion of the reduced supply of long-
term tax-exempts by shifting to the note market, where net new issues
have picked up noticeably this year, particularly with contra-seasonal
increases in March and June when long-term offerings declined substan-
tially. Earlier this year, when the tax-exempt yield curve was more
upward sloping, some of the note issuers may have been forced by rate
ceilings to borrow short. More recently, however, many of the 3- and
6-month tax-exempt offerings have been bond-anticipation notes issued
by governmental units that could have financed long-term had they
chose to do so, but who apparently expected lower interest costs this
summer and fall.

These large offerings of short-term tax-exempts have pressed
against a market made tighter by commercial bank liquidation of such
obligations, by competition from increased commercial paper issues, and
by the reduced liquidity of corporations, who are important buyers of
municipal notes. Consequently, the best quality 6-month tax-exempt
notes have risen over 100 basis points since early May, as shown in the
earlier table on security yields, and almost 200 basis points since the
beginning of 1969; these increases are roughly twice those in the long-
term bond market. Dealers report very few postponements at these
higher yields, but the level of yields has made it impossible to sell
outstanding notes in the secondary market except with large capital losses.

III -15
In the corporate bond market, new offering yields have
increased about 70 basis points since mid-May. With the market under
increasing pressure in late May, dealers found it necessary to terminate
syndicates on several large issues with resultant upward yield adjust-
ments of 22 to 30 basis points. However, after the prime rate increase
on June 9, investor interest in high yielding new issues--e.g., 7.90
to 8 per cent for Aa public utilities--produced rapid sell-outs, with
institutional interest reported strong.

With capital outlays large and equity pressed, a negligible
amount of new corporate bond issues has so far been postponed or
cancelled. The staff now expects both June and July new public
offerings of corporate bonds to be slightly over $1 billion, more
than 10 per cent above the average pace of 1968 and the first quarter
of 1969. While all of the recent bond offerings continue to be
accounted for by public utilities and convertible offerings of medium-
sized corporations, at least two large industrial corporate offerings
of straight debt (amounting in total to $225 million) are expected
in the coming weeks--the first such issues since February. There have
been unconfirmable rumors that other large industrial borrowers may not
be able to postpone their permanent financing much longer; investment
bankers have suggested that many of the large firms that had been in a
position in early 1969 to postpone their capital market financing into
the second half may now be forced to enter capital markets, even at
current rate levels.
Our estimates of gross corporate security offerings in the
spring and early summer continue to be very large, reflecting the
unusually sharp increase in stock offerings to about twice the rate
of other recent years. These offerings are composed of a large number
of unusually small issues, and the backlog of registrations at the SEC
suggests a continued high volume unless there is an even sharper
break in stock prices. Aside from the high cost of debt issues, a
continued buoyant reception for new issues of stock of companies
with undemonstrated earnings and growth patterns has apparently
been the major factor.

U.S. Government securities market. After moving up steadily
in the last week of May and the first week of June, Treasury bill rates
increased sharply in the wake of the prime rate increase but have
recently moved back somewhat and are now generally around 40-50 basis
points above their levels at the time of the last Committee meeting.
Yields on Treasury coupon issues also advanced with the prime rate
increase, but since then, their yields have declined to the point
where all but the very shortest maturities are now significantly below
their May 27 levels. Short- and intermediate-term yields are from 1
to 8 basis points lower than three weeks ago, while longer maturity
yields have moved from 1 to 16 basis points lower over the period.

The increase in yields on Treasury coupon issues since late
May took place in a market that largely comprised professional activity
with very little retail demand reported and with dealers generally
unwilling to allow much, if any, build-up in their positions. As
has been the case for several months,varying reports bearing on the
state of the economy and on progress toward peace in Vietnam have
produced short-lived rallies or retreats in the coupon market; the
sharpest run-up in yields, amounting to 10-20 basis points, took
place immediately following the prime rate increase on June 9. Yields
on all maturities have moved fairly steadily lower since then, led by
long-term rates that have declined by as much as 20 basis points
from their highs.
The advance in bill rates early in the period following
the last Committee meeting continued to reflect dealers' concern
with current financing costs and their desire to assure that unwanted
inventories of bills were held down and even reduced. An additional
factor in the bill market, became considerably more important in early
June, was the substantial increase in the market supplies of bills
from foreign official sales. In the first two weeks or so of June
these sales, of which about two-thirds were purchased directly by
the System, totalled in excess of $1.8 billion. Most recently,
however, rates on Treasury bills have retreated about 30 basis points
from their highs, as Desk sales of foreign-held bills have diminished
and as dealers have begun to anticipate reinvestment demand from
maturing June tax bills.

III -19
The sharp rise in bill rates has brought the investment
yields for most issues due in over three months to more than 7 per
cent. At these levels, dealers recently may have been able to
avoid more than a small negative carry on their positions through
increased use of corporate repurchase financing outside of the
central money market at rates of 7- 7-1/4 per cent of slightly lower,
even with dealer loan rates at major banks in New York generally at
9 per cent or above since the last week in May. Recently, dealer
positions have shown some tendency to rise in anticipation of
reinvestment demand from maturing June tax bills. Nonetheless,
while positions in Treasury bills are somewhat above their very
depleted mid-May levels, at a level of only $2.0 billion these holdings
remain relatively small, particularly in trading account. Holdings
of coupon issues by dealers also continued to decline generally
from their late-May levels, although holdings of issues due in one
year or less increased somewhat, probably in part reflecting dealer
acquisition of the mid-June maturing issues.

Other short-term credit markets. Short-term credit demands,
especially through the commercial paper market, but also through the
markets for bankers' acceptances, finance paper, and short-term municipal
notes have increased markedly since the beginning of the year. Greater
demands on these markets have reflected the mounting pressure on bank
resources and the persistent high level of long-term rates. The result
has been that interest rates in all of the short-term markets have
risen steadily since the beginning of the year and have very recently
moved sharply higher.
In the first four months of this year, outstanding commercial
and finance paper and bankers' acceptances rose by nearly $4 billion,
considerably in excess of the January-April increase in any of the
preceding three years. In April alone, the rise in commercial and
finance paper outstanding totalled over $700 million. This advance
was more than accounted for by a $1 billion rise in paper placed
through dealers, representing primarily corporate finance demands through
commercial paper issuance.

Rates on 4-6 month commercial paper have risen by 180
basis points since early January, while the 3-month finance paper
rate has moved up by a full percentage point, and the 3-month bankers'
acceptance rate by more than 1-1/2 percentage points. As shown in
the table below, the greater part of the increase in these rates
has come in recent weeks, undoubtedly reflecting an even greater
reliance on these markets in May in the face of intense pressures
on the supply of bank funds, as well as some probable lessening of
availability of funds in these markets. An additional indication
of the pressure for funds through these channels is provided by the
very sharp rise in secondary market CD rates, which in the week
ending June 11 advanced by 50 basis points.
With demands on the Agency market fairly sizeable, short-
term Federal agency rates have also risen sharply, with the 6-month
rate most recently nearly 90 basis points over the end-May level.
As has been the case with other short-term rates, the spread between
Agency rates and Treasury bill rates has widened somewhat, although
the recent net increase in bill rates has offset a portion of the
very large yield spread which developed at the very beginning of June.

Federal finance. Board staff projections of budget receipts
and outlays for fiscal 1969 remain unchanged from the last Greenbook, with
the Treasury operating balance at the end of the fiscal year
estimated at $6.4 billion. This estimate assumes a sizable amount
of tax receipts obtained from delayed processing during the remainder
of June and some let-up in the very heavy spending rates that have
been experienced by the Treasury in the first part of June. If this
forecast and staff estimates of budget figures for the third quarter
of calendar 1969 prove to be approximately correct, only $2-$3 billion
of new cash borrowing for payment in the latter half of July would be
required to maintain the cash balance above $3 billion through the end
of that month. Another $2 billion would probably be needed in August
to carry the Treasury cash balance through its seasonal low in mid-
September. Such cash needs would be relatively modest compared to
third quarter borrowings in recent years.
Budget prospects for fiscal 1970 would appear to be relatively
1/clear on the outlays side, assuming that something like the rigid/
$192.9 billion spending ceiling that passed the House last month is also
approved by the Senate. The credibility of this projection for outlays
has been increased somewhat by recent indications of some slowing in
defense spending. First quarter contract awards, a reliable leading
indicator of defense outlays, were 10 per cent below fourth quarter levels.
1/ "Rigid" in the sense that only Congress can change it; none of the
so-called uncontrollable programs exempted from last year's ceiling
can escape the new limit.

III -24
On the receipts side, staff estimates are based on the assumptions
that the surtax will be extended and the investment tax credit
terminated as the President has recommended. The staff's projection
of a further slowing of economic growth results in estimated receipts
of only $195.4 billion, yielding a surplus almost $4 billion short
of the $6.3 billion Administration estimate. (Staff projection of
a high-employment surplus would be in line with the Administration
estimate.)

U.S. balance of payments. As measured by the adjusted over-
all balance or by the liquidity balance, extraordinary deficits
accumulated in early June. The data now point to a second-quarter
deficit of over $3-1/2 billion, to be added to the first quarter
deficit (adjusted over-all) of $1.9 billion. (These are quarterly,
not annual rates.)
On the official settlements basis there may be a small surplus
in the second quarter, as the underlying deficit plus the massive flows
into German marks in early May have been offset since then by a flow of
funds from Germany and other foreign sources into the Euro-dollar market,
and thence into borrowings of U.S. head offices from their European
branches.
A disconcerting feature of developments this year has been
the failure of the statistical reporting system to record all flows
accounting for the balances measured by settlement items. The accounts
for the first quarter have now been assembled (page I--T-3, Confidential
until published by the Department of Commerce) and these show negative

IV -2
"errors and omissions" more than $1 billion larger than the average
quarterly amount last year or in 1967. Similarly, the second quarter
results will probably not be fully explained by the data regularly
collected. In any case very little information is yet available on
transactions in May or June. Guesses point to shifts of funds from
the United States to Europe, into German mark assets in late April
and early May and into Euro-dollars throughout the period since
February and especially in June. Companies and persons who have made
these shifts may include both foreign and U.S. investors. They would
not necessarily be major U.S. corporations or nonbank financial
institutions, whose operations are kept under review.
In April foreign net purchases of U.S. corporate stocks
slowed further, from $100 million in March to $70 million in April.
There was a $60 million net outflow of bank-reported claims on
foreigners, of which $50 million took the form of increase in foreign
currency deposit balances. Information on April merchandise trade
is given below.
The new data on the first-quarter balance of payments,
besides containing a large negative errors and omissions as noted
above, show the following features in transactions other than trade:
(1) Corporate investors put about $600 million, net of the
use of foreign funds, into their foreign affiliates, which was about
the same as the quarterly average in 1968, well within the rate of

IV -3
investment allowable under the regulations. There was a small recorded
outflow (under $200 million) into short-term assets and claims abroad,
of which about half was proceeds of borrowings abroad by U.S. companies.
Borrowings abroad through new issues were quite large ($400 million) and
included about $150 million of issues to finance domestic rather than
foreign ventures. (In the second quarter new issues have been relatively
small and show little sign of reviving.)
(2) Receipts from direct investments did reasonably well, reaching
an annual rate of $5.3 billion, compared with the 1968 total of $5.0
billion. But income paid abroad--largely as interest on short-term
foreign claims on the United States, reached an annual rate of $3.6
billion in the first quarter, against $2.9 billion for the year 1968.
Moreover, payments of interest had not yet begun to reflect the peaking
of interest rates paid on borrowed Euro-dollars and on U.S. Government
obligations.
(3) The flow of U.S. Government grants and credits remained
at its fourth-quarter level, somewhat reduced from earlier last year
as a result of lower shipments under farm product disposal programs.
The cash outlay connected with Government aid programs has declined
slightly since 1965, and is now running about $650 million per year.
(4) The balance on military transactions (expenditures abroad
less receipts under military sales contracts) has also held steady,
running about $3.2 billion per year.

IV -4
(5) Special financial transactions with foreign governments
have been greatly reduced. Last year they amounted to $2.6 billion, and
in the fourth quarter alone they were over $800 million; in the first
quarter this year they were only $60 million and the only sizable item
in the second quarter so far has been the quarterly $125 million receipt
from Germany.
U.S. foreign trade. Our basic trade position continues to be
obscured by the aftermath of the longshoremen's strike. In April an
export surplus was recorded, with exports at $3.3 billion and imports
$3.2 billion (both on the balance of payments basis). The surplus was
less than half that of March as imports rose more than exports. While
both exports and imports in April are estimated to have been above
"normal", the recovery from the dock strike is apparently still very
partial. Although the strike ended at most Atlantic coast ports by
the end of February, facilities at these ports were still congested in
April, with adverse effect particularly on exports. In addition, the
Boston and West Gulf custom areas did not reopen until early April,
further limiting cargo movements in that month. The backlogs of cargo--
particularly grains--waiting to be exported at West Gulf ports were
reported to be still very large at the end of May.
Even if it is assumed that there was a permanent loss of
$400 million in exports and $200 million in imports as a result of the
strike, the cargo short-falls of the first four months of 1969 due to

IV -5
be made good later were apparently of the order of magnitude of $1 billion
for imports and somewhat more for exports. Current projections assume
that the catch-up would be completed in May-June, but it is possible
that it will extend into the third quarter.
In January-April there were continued increases in the two major
categories of exports not affected by the strike--aircraft, and shipments
to Canada. Deliveries of commercial aircraft in the first quarter of
this year were at a rate about 20 per cent above that of the last half
of 1968. However, April deliveries and preliminary information for May
indicate a sharp decline, possibly reflecting the beginning of a phaseout
of exports of current models before deliveries of the large Boeing 747's
start in 1970.
As an anti-inflationary measure the Canadian government proposed
in early June that the remaining 60 per cent of its Kennedy Round tariff
reductions become effective immediately. These reductions had been
scheduled to occur in three successive annual stages, ending January 1,
1972. About C$2 billion of Canadian imports are affected. The U.S.
supplies over two-thirds of Canada's imports; the acceleration in tariff
reductions should therefore serve to boost our exports there.
In the balance of payments statistics to be published two weeks
from now (confidential until then) merchandise trade figures for the
first quarter of 1969 and for the years 1946-68 have been revised to
incorporate new valuation adjustments for both exports and imports.

IV -6
The values for exports have been increased for all periods and those
for imports from 1965 on decreased. The upward adjustments for exports
based on a special study by the Census Bureau range between $150 and
$250 million a year, estimated to be the amount of previously omitted
U.S. inland freight to the border on exports, other than automobiles,
to Canada. The downward adjustments for imports range from $17 million
in 1965 to an annual rate of over $300 million in the first quarter of
this year. The adjustment reduces the value of imports of automobiles
from Canada from the higher custom values required by the U.S. tariff
regulations to the transaction values recorded by each parent U.S.
automobile company and its Canadian affiliate in intra-company accounts.
The adjustment places the value of imports of automobiles from Canada
on the same basis as used in reporting automobile exports to Canada,
thereby improving the accuracy of the statistics used in measuring
the impact of the U.S.-Canadian Automotive Agreement of 1965 on our
net balance with Canada.
Both the export and import valuation adjustments are made for
balance of payments purposes only and will not be reflected in the
trade data released by the Bureau of the Census. The revised figures
in the following table reflect the new valuation adjustments as well
as other revisions.

Euro-dollar market. The combination of very heavy American
bank bidding for Euro-dollar funds and normal June tightening of foreign
money markets has placed extreme pressure on Euro-dollar interest rates
since near the end of May. Rates reached their peak on June 10. In
the two weeks ending June 11, U.S. banks increased their borrowings
from foreign branches by over $2.0 billion. By Monday, June 16,
these borrowings increased by an additional $1.2 billion, according
to preliminary data. The Monday figure would reflect bidding for
deposits through the previous Thursday.

Euro-dollar rates reached their peak levels on Tuesday, June 10,
at which time one-month and three-month deposit rates were reported to
have reached 13 per cent per annum, or over 3 percentage points above
their level of two weeks earlier. Euro-dollar rates in the longer
maturities advanced nearly as much, and twelve-month funds were bid at
least as high as 11-1/2 per cent. Rates have declined steadily since
June 10. As of June 18 the call deposit rate had fallen by over
2-1/2 per cent and rates on maturities between one month and one year
had declined by an average of nearly 1-1/2 per cent from their peak
levels; one-month deposits were bid at 10-9/16 per cent, three-month
deposits at 10-13/16 per cent, and six-, and twelve-month deposits at
10-13/16 per cent and 10-7/16 per cent, respectively.

IV -9
Foreign exchange markets. Any tendency for seasonal
strengthening of European exchange rates has been overshadowed by
the pull of the Euro-dollar market. The working down of speculative
positions taken earlier in German marks was no doubt accelerated by
the attractiveness of Euro-dollar yields. The Bundesbank sold
substantial amounts spot, as well as providing dollars through swaps.
Some other continental central banks also experienced fairly sizable
reserve drains.
Beginning a week ago, the Bundesbank has sought to discourage
covered flows of funds from Germany by raising its swap offer rate to
a point where market cover can now be obtained on better terms than
Bundesbank cover. The swap rate--which had been at 6 per cent per
annum for several weeks--was raised to 7-1/2 per cent per annum on
June 11. With the market premium on forward marks at about 6-1/2 per
cent per annum, the flow of covered funds from Germany has been effectively
cut off for the time being.
The French franc has been under fairly continual selling
pressure since May 22 and the Bank of France has lost about $350 million
since that date. The drain is partly due to the French trade deficit.
Selling pressure accelerated after the first round of French presidential
elections on June 1, a development which may be related to a widely-
held view that the new French government may take some action on the
current franc parity.

IV -10 and 11
The Netherlands Bank has lost about $100 million since May 27.
The Belgian National Bank and some Scandinavian central banks had small
losses during the same period.
The market for sterling, on the other hand, has remained
comparatively firm during the past four weeks, and the Bank of England
has purchased dollars on balance. Since May 9 it has purchased over
$650 million, slightly more than offsetting its losses in the three
previous weeks. Sterling money market rates, such as those on local
authority deposits, rose in May but showed little sign of Euro-dollar
market pressures in June.
The market for Swiss francs has been strong -- in contrast
to most other currencies -- reflecting the repatriation of funds by
Swiss commercial banks for mid-year liquidity needs. The Swiss National
Bank has announced that it will make $250 million equivalent of domestic
funds available to Swiss banks through foreign exchange swaps. Additional
liquidity will have to be acquired by the banks by selling dollar assets
outright and rediscounting eligible paper at the Swiss National Bank.
The price of gold has fluctuated rather widely on European
markets during the past three weeks, dropping sharply from $43.50
an ounce on May 23 to $40.62 on June 6. More recently it has been
around the $41.00 an ounce level. Market comments indicate belief
that the South Africans may be selling some gold and that there may
be some movement from gold to dollars in response to very high interest
rates.

IV -12
Price developments in major industrial countries. During the
second half of 1968 and the early months of 1969 the rate of wholesale
price increases in all major industrial countries, including the United
States, accelerated, in some cases quite markedly. Consumer prices
continued to rise. In all countries except the United Kingdom, the chief
cause of this acceleration has been the pressure of demand, generating
and reflecting strong economic expansion. To a lesser extent tax changes
and higher interest rates also accounted for price advances. At the
wholesale level, world market price increases for materials, including
steel and non-ferrous metals, also affected prices in the various countries.
The continuing rise of consumer prices in the United Kingdom
reflected seasonal factors and last November's increase in indirect taxes.
An easing of British demand pressures is evidenced by the 1 per cent decline
in real consumption from the fourth quarter of last year to the first
quarter of 1969.

Although U.S. wholesale prices of manufactured goods have
increased faster so far in 1969 than they did last year, their rise
has been exceeded in most other industrial countries. Based on
1963 = 100, the U.S. wholesale price index for manufactured goods in
1968 had averaged 1.2 per cent higher than an average of the price
indexes of such goods in eight other major industrial countries (weighted
by the share of each country in their total industrial exports). In the
first quarter of 1969, the U.S. index was only 0.2 per cent higher than
the weighted average index of the other countries.

Beginning with the last quarter of 1968 price increases have
accelerated in Germany. This tendency became more marked at the wholesale
level during the early months of 1969 and is causing growing concern
among German officials, especially in view of their deeply imbedded
fears of inflation and the approach of the September parliamentary elections.
The authorities took several moderately restrictive measures in April and
May, but in spite of strong pressure from the Social Democratic members
of the government coalition decided not to revalue the mark, at least
during the pre-election period.
There is now considerable tightness in the labor market. The
unemployment rate has dropped well below 1 per cent of the labor force,
job vacancies are now considerably above the previous peak in 1965, and
the number of foreign workers in Germany is again rising rapidly and
will soon overtake the 1966 pre-recession figure of 1.3 million. The
high demand for labor is reflected in an acceleration of wage rate increases:
during the first quarter of 1969 hourly wage rates in industry increased
at an annual rate of 6.2 per cent, compared with about 5.4 per cent in
the second half of 1968. However, productivity gains have so far been
sufficient to hold unit labor costs, which had been declining before
1968, steady in 1968 and the first quarter of 1969.
The rise in consumer prices--due earlier this year mainly to
seasonal increases in food prices--appears to have abated a little in
recent weeks. However, the lagged effect of increases at the wholesale
level will probably soon be reflected in retail prices.

IV -15
Although prices and costs in Germany have risen since November,
German export prices increased only 3.8 per cent between November and
March despite the 4 per cent border tax adjustment adopted in November 1968.
The expected decline in import prices after the border tax adjustment did
not occur. Import prices rose by 1.9 per cent between November 1968 and
March 1969. They were influenced by higher foreign prices but also,
it seems, by absorption of tax relief into profit margins of German
import distributors.
Prices in France continued to advance sharply during the early
months of 1969, in response to very strong domestic demand. Increases in
the value-added tax rates, applied at the wholesale level last December
and on retail goods in January, contributed to the rise. The rate of
price increases, which is in excess of the official targets, casts some
doubt upon the effectiveness of the system of price controls which is in
force in France. On June 13 the Bank of France.increased its discount
rate from 6 to 7 per cent, foreshadowing fiscal restraint which the new
government is expected to impose.
Import prices have risen sharply mainly because of the increase
in border taxes and have contributed to the rise in domestic prices.
Export prices, however, according to recent French estimates, were only
1 per cent above the 1967 average during the first quarter of 1969. The
substitution in November 1968 of a value-added tax, rebatable on exports,
for the non-rebatable payroll tax has helped to preserve price competitive-
ness of French exports.

IV -16
Wage negotiations, broken off last March, are due to resume
soon. Even assuming that the government is successful in limiting wage
increases this year to the target figure of 6 per cent--an unlikely
development--French consumer prices will continue to advance, probably
in excess of the official target of 5.8 per cent, for 1969 as a whole
relative to 1968. The French current account deficit continued to widen
during the first five months of this year and domestic price increases
are likely to be reflected soon in export prices as well, thus aggravating
the current account deficit.
In the United Kingdom, consumer prices have increased at an
annual rate of about 6 per cent during the first quarter of 1969. The
April budget increased some indirect taxes. Furthermore, the higher rate
of the Selective Employment Tax, which will be introduced next month, will
certainly be passed on, if only in part, to the consumer. Consumer prices
are thus certain to continue to advance--although at a diminishing rate--
during the remainder of the year.
Wholesale price increases have been much more moderate. Both
export and import prices, as measured by the unit value indices, have
been stable this year. Since the devaluation of the pound, import
prices have risen by about 13 per cent and export prices by about 10 per
cent. The latter figure suggests that, in terms of currencies which were
not devalued, prices of British exports now average about 5 per cent less
than what they were before the change in the parity of the pound.

After a long period of exceptional price stability, Italian
prices began showing accelerated increases early last fall, responding to
a more rapid expansion of aggregate demand as well as to some seasonal
influences. But, compared to other countries, Italian prices are still
rising only moderately.
However, the quickening of price increases, both on the wholesale
and retail level, has given rise to some official concern. The Governor
of the Bank of Italy recently urged moderation in the provision of wage
increases in the new labor contracts to be negotiated in the second half
of this year, and warned against excessive increases in government
expenditures.
Since the end of 1968, there has also been an accelerated rise
in wholesale prices in Belgium. The underlying factor has been the
continuing and apparently rising expansion in aggregate demand, but
increased import prices also contributed very substantially to this
process. Consumer prices have also been rising faster and may continue
to do so if only in lagged response to recent increases at the wholesale
level.
Consumer prices in the Netherlands increased very sharply during
the first quarter of this year. Again, the underlying reason has been
a very buoyant domestic demand, but in addition, the Dutch introduced the
value-added tax system at the beginning of the year. The changeover was
accompanied by a great deal of confusion and it is apparent that it was
widely used as an opportunity to increase prices, leading authorities
to impose a number of restrictive measures, which culminated in a general

price freeze on April 9. Prices were frozen at their March 14 level and
in some cases are even to be brought back to the level of October 1, 1968.
The measure appears to have had some effect since consumer prices declined
by 0.2 per cent in May.
Rapid expansion of the Canadian economy is being reflected in
a marked acceleration of price increases. This is especially noticeable
at the wholesale level, where prices of manufactured goods have been
increasing during the first quarter of 1969 at an annual rate of about
8.5 per cent. The increase in export prices, however, has been somewhat
less strong. The consumer price index, which rose moderately during the
first quarter of 1969, increased by 1.2 per cent in April. This exception-
ally sharp increase appears to reflect price rises at the wholesale level
earlier this year. Although the index rose only 0.2 per cent in May,
the rate of price increases is likely to accelerate in the next several
months. The Canadian authorities are currently pursuing much more
restrictive monetary and fiscal policies than in the last half of 1968--
the Bank of Canada raised its discount rate from 7 to 7-1/2 per cent on
June 11, the third increase in six months. These restrictive policies
may begin to reduce inflationary pressures around the end of the year.
Wholesale prices in Japan were quite steady in 1968 but have
recently started rising more rapidly, influenced especially by world
market conditions for raw materials and semi-finished goods. Later this
year, wholesale prices are expected to continue to rise moderately, but
Japanese consumer price increases are expected to accelerate slightly.
