SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK
Outlook for economic activity
Expansion in economic activity in the second quarter now
appears to have been about the same as in the preceding quarter, when
real GNP increased at an annual rate of 2.8 per cent. Assuming ex-
tension of the surtax, the available evidence continues to suggest
further slackening of real growth in the second half of the year.
However, only a modest slowing in the pace of price advance from the
exceptionally rapid rate of the first half of the year is in prospect.
In the present quarter, current dollar GNP will be lifted by
the Federal pay raise. In addition, growth in disposable income and
consumption is being raised temporarily by the ending of tax payments
on 1968 liabilities; virtually all of the prospective advance in personal
income will be translated into an increase in disposable income. Thus,
a faster rise in consumer spending appears likely this quarter.
But some major forces making for slowing in overall
expansion are likely to be evident this quarter and their impact should
be more pervasive later in the fall when consumer spending is projected
to moderate in line with smaller prospective growth of employment and
incomes. Chief among these forces is the anticipated erosion of the
expansive thrust of business spending on plant and equipment, as in-
dicated in the recent Commerce-SEC survey.
Residential construction activity declined in June and further
declines are in prospect this year. The much tighter availability of

I -2
funds may be substantially curtailing new commitments by thrift
institutions and construction loans by banks, and may operate to re-
duce fourth quarter starts below present projections. Apart from the
pay raise, Federal expenditures appear to be under considerable restraint,
with some decline in prospect in the fourth quarter. Finally, in
contrast to earlier judgments, net exports of goods and services are
now expected to provide virtually no lift to activity to the end of
the year.
In summary, most major factors point to the probability of a
further slowing in economic growth over the months ahead, although the
timing and pattern of change are uncertain. Our projection calls for
a sharp fall-off in final sales in the fourth quarter, but for GNP
expansion to be sustained by continued inventory accumulation, in part
involuntary. With this background, real growth appears likely to halt
or even turn negative in the first half of 1970.
Outlook for resource use and prices
Key measures of resource use have shown little change since
early this year. Industrial production increased strongly in June,
bringing the second quarter annual rate of increase to about 6 per
cent, and keeping pace with estimated growth in capacity. Some mod-
eration in growth of industrial production is in prospect for the
third quarter, but the rate of advance as of now seems likely to be
relatively well maintained. This appraisal is based on the index level

I-3
reached in June, auto production schedules for the summer, reportedly
strong orders for steel, and the likelihood that the upward momentum
in output of machinery and equipment will not be reversed in a short
time. In the fourth quarter, with expansion in real takings of goods
dropping off, industrial production appears likely to show little or
no increase and the capacity utilization rate a significant decline.
The labor market continued tight throughout the second
quarter but nonfarm payroll employment advanced strongly in June and
the unemployment rate edged down to 3.4 per cent from 3.5 per cent in
May. Expansion in employment for the second quarter as a whole,
however, was appreciably less than the advanced first quarter pace.
For the rest of the year, the projected slackening in GNP growth
suggests further moderation in employment gains and a slow rise in the
unemployment rate from the 3.5 per cent average of the second quarter.
On the labor cost side, increases in average hourly earnings
in recent months have been smaller than in late 1968. But recent
contract settlements, though relatively few, have provided first year
wage increases of 10 per cent or more, suggesting that pressures on
prices from the cost side will continue strong. With the intensity of
demand in markets easing, profit margins are likely to come under in-
creasing constraint.
The wholesale industrial price average has been virtually
stable in the most recent months because a rapid decline in lumber

I-4
and plywood prices has offset widespread increases for other commodities.
When lumber prices bottom, as may already be occurring, the average is
likely to resume an appreciable rate of increase even though advances
in other commodity groups may slow. The prospects for any sizable
moderation in the rate of increase of consumer prices later this
year have been dampened by a sharp decline in fourth quarter pork
supply prospects. Thus, retail food prices are likely to advance
more than had been estimated earlier, and there is little reason to
expect any marked abatement in the continued advance of services.
Outlook for supply of funds
Bank deposits will remain under downward pressure so long
as current high market yields and present Regulation Q ceilings
prevail. Outstanding negotiable CD's are expected to continue de-
clining during the next several weeks, although at a somewhat more
moderate pace than in June as the amount of CD's maturing is reduced.
Consumer-type time and savings deposits at large banks probably will
decline rather sharply in the first half of July and then more mod-
erately in the ensuing weeks, while growth in such deposits at smaller
banks will remain quite constrained. Private demand deposits, aside
from the influence of changes in Treasury deposits, would be expected
to show only relatively slow growth under existing conditions of re-
duced credit availability and high interest rates.
With such a deposit outlook, and with liquidity already sharply
reduced, banks will probably have to tighten lending terms still further

I-5
as summer progresses and become more selective in their mortgage,
consumer, and business lending activity. Banks will also be of
limited, if any, support to the State and local and U.S. Government
securities markets.
The supply of funds to the mortgage market is likely to be
dampened also by the experience of thrift institutions around the
midyear interest-crediting period. Although it is still too early
to make firm judgments, all indications suggest that savings outflows
at thrift institutions are likely to be around mid-1966 proportions.
And net inflows are likely to remain at a reduced pace over the
balance of the summer, given current market yields and judging from
second quarter experience.
The effect on the mortgage market may be pronounced, though
not as drastic as in 1966. The institutions seem to be better prepared
for outflows, and the FHLBB has begun to make large advances to cover
both withdrawals and mortgage expansion. In addition, FNMA is a major
factor sustaining Federally-underwritten mortgages. Still, new commit-
ment activity can be expected to moderate further and mortgage interest
rates to remain under upward pressure.
Outlook for credit flows
Corporate demands on the capital market are expected to remain
quite large over the next several weeks, and the increase in offerings
has again placed upward pressure on yields. The bulk of recent and
prospective offerings is from large issuers and, in contrast to the

I-6
previous nine months, includes several large industrial offerings.
This step-up in capital market borrowing apparently reflects the erosion
of corporate liquidity and the reduced availability of bank credit.
Business loans at banks are expected to increase less rapidly
in July and August than in the first 5 months of this year, but to show
more strength than in June, a month in which outstanding business loans
showed little net change. While last month's experience was in part a
reflection of anticipatory borrowing earlier, sales of loans, and
statistical aberrations, the recently intensified efforts of banks to
cut back on the volume of new loan commitments and to discourage new
borrowing should Serve to keep a renewed business loan rise to relatively
moderate proportions. Demand factors, too, would appear to be working
in that direction over the summer, as the rise in business fixed invest-
ment expenditures is expected to slacken and record high interest rates
may induce businesses to economize on working capital.
In the long-term tax-exempt market, offerings are expected to
remain considerably below normal as State interest rate ceilings limit
new issues and as some borrowers await lower rates in the future. The
light calendar has insulated the municipal market from recent upward
yield pressure, but the withdrawal of commercial banks from the market
makes tax-exempts very sensitive to any small increases in borrowing
demand that might develop.
While the State and local government area appears relatively
quiescent at the moment, the Federal Government and Federal agencies

I- 7
are likely to be additional sources of market pressure over the weeks
ahead. It would appear that the Federal Home Loan Banks may attempt to
borrow about $2 billion in July and August, which would raise a little
more than $1 billion of new cash. FNMA will also probably be forced to
reduce its liquid asset holdings and increase its borrowings, though
by only a total for both of about $500 million, to finance earlier
commitments coming due. And the Treasury will probably have to raise
another $1-1/2 billion or so of new cash by August in addition to the
current $3-1/2 billion tax bill offering. Finally, the Treasury at the
end of July will announce refunding terms for at least the mid-August
maturities of coupon issues of which $3.2 billion are publicly held.
Against the background of prevailing monetary restraint, the
corporate bond market calendar and the Agency financing demands in
combination with Treasury requirements suggest continued upward interest
rate pressures over the next few weeks--pretty much along the shole
maturity spectrum (except possibly for very short-term rates). With
little prospect for any pick-up in the flows of funds available for
lending and investing from institutional sources, especially banks and
thrift institutions, an abatement of interest rate pressures appears to
depend on shifts in expectations or an unanticipated moderation of
near-term credit demands.

i-8
Balance of payments outlook
Although demand conditions abroad are expected to remain very
strong throughout 1969, the prospects are poor for any significant
improvement in the U.S. current account balance this year. Some further
rise in the level of U.S. imports of goods is virtually certain, while
the continuing rise in exports of goods is being dampened by a drop in
commercial aircraft shipments pending next year's crop of Boeing 747's.
In services, including investment income payments and receipts, no
sizable net improvement can be expected.
The outlook for capital flows--other than flows dominated by
fears and expectations of changes in currency parities--remains as it
was described in the chart show two weeks ago. During the next several
quarters the average levels of inflows of foreign long-term capital into
U.S. stocks and into new securities issued to finance corporate direct
investments are likely to be lower than they were in 1968 or in the
first few months of 1969.
Because these inflows, together with the small current account
surplus, will fall far short of matching outflows of U.S. private and
government capital, further sizable quarterly overall deficits on the
liquidity basis lie ahead. Whether in any particular quarter the
deficit on this basis will be greatly swollen--as it was in the second
quarter of this year--by massive outflows of funds from the United States
into other currencies or into Euro-dollars is conjectural. So too is the

I-9
future course of U.S. banks' borrowings of Euro-dollars; among the
uncertainties is the reaction of the banks to the imposition of
reserve requirements on these borrowings.
The impact on the official settlements balance of any flows
of funds from the United States feeding the Euro-dollar market would
of course be offset by associated expansion of the U.S. banks' Euro-
dollar borrowings. It is not impossible that the further growth of
these borrowings may at times be large enough to prevent additions
to net foreign official reserve claims on the United States--as it
has during the past year and a half. Protection of our reserve
position in this manner becomes more and more precarious as time goes
on, depending as it does on continuation of severe monetary tightness
in the United States.

THE ECONOMIC PICTURE IN DETAIL
The Nonfinancial Scene
Gross national product. The increase in current dollar GNP
in the second quarter is now expected to be close to the $16 billion
gain of the first quarter. Price increases continue widespread, and
the GNP implicit price deflator is estimated to have advanced at a
4.3 per cent per year rate--as rapidly as in the first quarter. Higher
prices accounted for three-fifths of the increase in total expenditures.
The rise in real GNP in the second quarter--2.6 per cent--also was about
the same as in the first quarter but the rate of growth continued to
be less than half as rapid as a year earlier.
Recent information provides little basis for changing the
pattern of activity projected in the June 24 presentation to the FOMC.
Thus, we continue to project growth in real GNP slowing appreciably
after midyear and ceasing in the first half of next year. Consequently,
the substantial price increases of recent quarters are projected to
begin easing a little before the end of this year, and to moderate
somewhat further by mid-1970.
The increase now estimated for GNP in the second quarter is
slightly larger than projected three weeks ago./ This is due mainly
to indications of a quickened pace of inventory investment. Inventory
1/ The official Commerce estimates of second quarter GNP will be
available about mid-month; these figures, it should be noted, will
reflect the annual GNP revisions, covering the 1966 to 1968 period.

II -2
accumulation by manufacturers accelerated appreciably in May--to
$980 million in book value terms from $700 million in April. Stocks
of merchant wholesalers are now reported to have risen by $260 million
instead of declining nearly $50 million, and preliminary figures in-
dicate a further small rise in May. And accumulation of inventories at
retail stores, because of relatively sluggish May and June sales,
probably will also exceed earlier expectations. Accumulation of nonfarm
business inventories, GNP basis, is now estimated to have exceeded
$7 billion, annual rate, in the second quarter, nearly $1.5 billion
more than estimated three weeks ago.
GNP was also raised last quarter because of higher expenditures
reported for residential construction than had previously been anticipated;
the higher level reflects a sharp jump in estimated spending for additions
and alterations. This increase in additions and alterations, which more
than offset a drop of nearly $1 billion in outlays for new dwelling units,
may be substantially overstated and revised downward as soon as a firm
basis for estimate becomes available. On the other hand, available data
now suggest only a $.3 billion increase (annual rate) in net exports of
goods and services, in contrast to a rise of nearly $2.5 billion estimated
earlier.
Some slackening in the advance of consumption expenditures
has apparently developed recently. May retail sales are now indicated

II -3
to have decline 1 per cent, instead of holding at the advanced April
level; and weekly data for June suggest only a small increase in that
month. Dealer deliveries of new autos, however, increased in both
months, reaching a 9.0 million annual rate for domestic-type cars in
June. The saving rate was little changed.
Beyond the second quarter, the projected pattern continues
to assume Federal budget outlays for fiscal 1970 limited to $192.9
billion, extension of the tax surcharge, the elimination of the invest-
ment tax credit, and continuation until fall of a restrictive monetary
policy.
Growth projected for current dollar GNP this quarter, $15
billion annual rate, is only slightly smaller than in the second
quarter. The pace of expansion in current dollar GNP is being
maintained by the Federal pay raise, effective this month and totaling
$2.8 billion, and the reduction in Federal tax payments following final
settlement of 1968 tax liabilities including the retroactive portion
of the surcharge. These factors raise disposable income substantially,
and a larger gain in consumer spending this quarter--projected at
$10 billion--than last thus seem likely even with the assumed small
increase in the saving rate.
A marked slowing of the rise in business plant and equipment
expenditures is indicated for the current quarter--to an advance of
2 per cent compared with 4-1/2 per cent in the first half of the year,

II -4
according to the April-May Commerce-SEC survey. Residential construction
activity is also expected to be a significant retarding influence in
the economy, with expenditures projected to fall by a $1.5 billion
annual rate reflecting limited availability of mortgage funds and
high prevailing interest rates.
Without the stimulus of the Federal pay raise, downward
pressures on the economy should intensify and in the fourth quarter
GNP is projected to rise by only $11 billion. Final demands are ex-
pected to moderate considerably, with the sustained impact of fiscal
and monetary policies acting further to ease business spending and
residential construction activity and with Federal spending under
constraint. With softening in these important sectors, gains in employ-
ment and income should slow appreciably and limit the rise in consumer
expenditures. However, some involuntary inventory building may result
from the slowing of growth in final demands. Altogether, real GNP may
rise at a rate of only about 1 per cent.
After the turn of the year growth in final sales should be
further retarded, thereby weakening this major incentive for accumula-
tion, which is projected to fall substantially in early 1970--from
an $8 billion annual rate in the fourth quarter to $5 billion in the
first and $2 billion in the second. With key sources of strength in
the economy significantly weakened, expansion in real GNP is projected

II -5
to come to a halt in the first half of next year. Demand pressures on
labor, production facilities, materials, and financial resources should
tend to ease, and increases in the overall price deflator may moderate
to around 3.0 per cent, annual rate, by midyear.

Industrial production. On the basis of available product and
employment data, industrial production in June is estimated to have
risen one point, and possibly more, to 174 per cent of the 1957-59
average, about the same increase as from April to May. This would
bring the second quarter annual rate of increase to about 6 per cent
compared with 6.7 per cent in the first quarter and 5 per cent in the
fourth quarter of last year.
Auto assemblies in June rose to an annual rate of 8.6 million
units from the strike curtailed rate of 7.6 million in May. Production
schedules for the third quarter are set higher than the June rate.
Among other consumer goods, output of furniture increased and production
of television sets changed little from the reduced May level. Production
of industrial and commercial equipment rose substantially further and
output of trucks recovered following the strike settlements in the auto-
motive industry. Production of defense equipment, however, was curtailed
by a strike at Bell Helicopter Co. Output of most industrial materials
is estimated to have increased further except coal, as production declined
sharply in observance of the death of John L. Lewis.
Despite an apparent leveling off in output in some sectors--
notably home goods and apparel which changed little after March, even
though the second quarter as a whole is up--there is little evidence as
yet of an overall slowdown in industrial production.

II -9
While a further rise in industrial production is anticipated
in the third quarter, a somewhat larger proportion of total output
appears to have been going into inventories and this--combined with the
softness in retail sales, some further turndown in output of defense
equipment, and the predicted easing in production of business equipment--
could well lead to a marked slowing of output growth in the later months
of the year.

Retail sales. The latest figures suggest a continuation of
the faltering growth of retail sales that began last fall. Second
quarter sales may be only 1 per cent above the first quarter as a
result of a downward revision in the May figures--which now indicate
a 1 per cent decrease from April rather than the slight increase of theII I I

II -10
advance report. Weekly sales reports for June suggest that there will
be some increase from May but probably only back to the April level.
In real terms, the second quarter level of sales may be only a negligible
amount above a year earlier.
Department stores sales in June, on a year-over-year basis,
again appear to have been considerably higher than sales in general.
But the group showed substantially greater declines than the total
of retail sales from April to May, and June sales will probably only
be at about the April level. The important chain stores recently
reported the smallest gains over-the-year since the fiscal year began
in late January.
Unit sales of new autos, however, have recently been an
exception to the overall pattern of retail sales. Thus sales of new
domestic autos rose 6 per cent further from May to June and at an
annual rate of 8.9 million units were 2 per cent above a year earlier,
reflecting in part the end of work stoppages at General Motors, Average
sales for the second quarter were at an annual rate of a little over
8.5 million units. Dealer's stocks of new autos declined further in
June bringing the seasonally adjusted stock-sales ratio down to 49.6
days. This is considerably below the high of about 62 days earlier this
year and about the same as a year earlier.
Seasonally adjusted auction prices of used cars in May were
down somewhat from April, but were still 3 per cent above a year earlier.

Consumer credit. While extensions of consumer instalment credit
were somewhat smaller in May than in April, there was an even larger
decline in repayments. As a result, the May increase in instalment
credit outstanding--nearly $10.2 billion at a seasonally adjusted
annual rate--was the largest so far this year, and close to the peak
rates of the second half of 1968.
Monthly increases in outstandings have been uneven for the
year to date; on balance, however, growth has amounted to more thann1969-- - --

II -12
$8.8 billion at an annual rate, about the same as for the full year 1968.
Nevertheless, gains have moderated since the large advances in last
year's third and fourth quarters, with the increases occurring primarily
at commercial banks. These institutions had raised their holdings of
consumer credit paper very sharply in the second half of 1968 and had
accounted for nearly one-half of the overall increase in instalment credit
at that time. Finance companies and credit unions have continued to
increase their holdings of consumer credit more rapidly than in late
1968.

The Michigan Survey Research Center Survey. The index of
consumer sentiment declined significantly in the May-June survey from
the February level. Generally, large movements in this index have been
a reasonably reliable indicator of a future change in the same direction1Retail

in consumer expenditures for durable goods. But it is uncertain whether
this generalization will apply to recent experience since the increase
in the February 1969 index may have reflected initial optimism about the
economic policies of a new Administration and the recent decline has
brought the index back to the general range prevailing over the past
two years.

Three-fourths of the recent decline was attributable to a shift
in the number of families expecting either to be "worse off" or that
general business conditions would become bad. Generally, pessimistic
families were also families with heightened inflationary fears. Also,
the survey found some indication that consumers have become more
sensitive to the interest rates charged on credit for automobiles
and household durables, and might delay expenditures because rates were
too high. The survey reported a further deterioration over the year in
the number of families with favorable views of purchasing conditions
for a house--but a growing number of families (about 10 per cent)

II -14
thought it was a good time to buy a house because interest rates were
going higher.
Intentions to purchase both new and used cars in the next
12 months were up over the year, but an unusually high proportion of
people were uncertain when they would make the actual purchase.

Leading indicators. The composite leading indicator for
May was down slightly, but was higher than any month except April.
This series is sufficiently irregular that no significance should be
ascribed to May's small decline. There were declines in nonagricultural
placements, private housing building permits, durable new orders, and
plant and equipment contracts and orders; the last two were expected
following April's spurt in equipment ordering. Series increasing in
May were industrial materials prices, the monthly average of stock
prices, and the ratio of price to unit labor cost in manufacturing.
In June, materials prices continued to rise, the manufacturing work-
week continued unchanged, the stock price average declined sharply,
and there are reasons for expecting some further decline in new orders

for durable goods. The coincident and lagging indicators continued to
rise in May.

Manufacturers' inventories and shipments. The book value of
manufacturers' inventories rose nearly $1 billion in May, more than in
April or the average of the first quarter. Much of the increase has
been in durable goods industries, especially in holdings of goods in
process. Machinery and equipment manufacturers continued to build
stocks rather rapidly, and there was an exceptionally large increase
at defense industries. Nondurable inventories also expanded at a
faster rate than in the first quarter.

Durable goods shipments changed little in May and the durable

1966 and about as high as last spring when steel stocks were at their
pre-strike peak. Durable unfilled orders continued to rise, but stocks
also remained high realtive to unfilled orders, particularly in the
defense industries.

Although both the overall ratios and the recent rate of
accumulation are relatively high, there are indications that high
rates of inventory growth in manufacturing could continue for some
months. For example, the relatively low levels of materials held
and on order relative to sales and orders for end products suggest
the likelihood of continued stock building for the near term. De-
fense products and consumer durables are the principal areas where
there may be an effort to slow inventory growth in the near future
unless orders increase.
Construction and real estate. Total outlays for new
construction, which were revised upward somewhat for recent months,
dipped slightly in June to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
$91.1 billion. All of the June decline was attributed to residential
outlays, which fell 3 per cent further from May, based on confidential
Census Bureau extrapolations.
For the second quarter as a whole, preliminary estimates of
total expenditures for new construction changed little from the record
first quarter rate. However, the slight quarter-to-quarter increase
now indicated in the private residential component may be overstated.
Outlays for new dwelling units dropped nearly $1 billion, or 4 per
cent, as shown in the table, but this was more than offset by a sharp
rise in "other" residential expenditures. Official downward revision

II -18
in the "other" category is planned as soon as firmer figures can be
secured on its major component, additions and alterations. Meanwhile,
outlays for private nonresidential construction apparently declined
from the first quarter, but were still at a very advanced rate. Public
construction outlays are estimated to have reached a new high in June
as well as for the second quarter. Most of the year-to-year change in
total construction outlays during the second quarter reflected higher
costs.

Labor market. Employment demand was strong enough in June to
absorb a larger-than-usual proportion of the summer jobseekers, and the
seasonally adjusted teenage unemployment rate fell nearly a full point
to 11.6 per cent. This improvement was large enough to bring the overall

II -19
unemployment rate down to 3.4 per cent, although the employment situation
for adults remained basically unchanged. Despite the continued strength
of the labor market, employment increases in the second quarter were
considerably smaller than in the first.

The composition of the June employment rise (192,000) followed
the pattern of recent months. There were moderate to strong increases
in the private and public service sectors and in capital goods industries.
In the consumer-goods and defense industries employment showed little
change.
Manufacturing employment recorded a fairly large advance.
The bulk of the rise was concentrated in electrical equipment, fabricated
metals, and primary metals industries. In other durable and nondurable
goods industries, employment remained at about March levels. Hours
worked in manufacturing held steady in June at 40.7 hours, slightly
below a year ago. Over the past few months, the recent strong advances

II -20
in manufacturing output and the slow rate of increase of labor input
(hours steady and employment rising slowly) indicate relatively strong
productivity gains.
Construction employment rose further in June, with about half
the increase attributable to reduced strike activity. The resilience of
construction employment appears to be related to continued strong
demands for commercial and industrial buildings and for highway con-
struction.
Wages and collective bargaining. Increases in hourly earnings
in both manufacturing and for the private economy as a whole have edged
down from the very rapid rates evident in late 1968. Because of the
rise in consumer prices, however, "real" hourly earnings have barely
grown at all in 1969. And, with both income and social security taxes
higher than in early 1968, the purchasing power of the average worker's
paycheck was slightly below a year ago.

The absence of real income gains and anticipated further sharp
increases in prices continue to generate demands for very large wage
increases. Recent contract settlements, while not large in number,
have provided first-year wage boosts averaging about 10 per cent; in
some construction settlements, first-year increases have been as large
as 15 per cent. Moreover, most agreements are now providing for larger
second and third year increases than those provided in the contracts of
1967 and 1968. There are relatively few major collective bargains
negotiations scheduled in the next two quarters, and the rate of increase
of wages is likely to continue near current levels for the remainder of
the year. But as bargaining becomes more widespread early next year and
as new higher demands are incorporated in the wage structure, efforts
to obtain even larger increases will likely occur.
Wholesale prices. A sharp rise in prices of farm and food
products caused the wholesale average to rise 0.4 per cent from mid-
May to mid-June. Average prices of industrial commodities were un-
changed in June for the first time since mid-1968, as further increases
for metals, machinery and gasoline were fully offset by marked declines
in prices of lumber, plywood and hides. Prices of softwood plywood in
mid-June were over 50 per cent below the previous peak, and well below
year earlier levels.
Nonferrous metal prices, which have advanced almost 10 per
cent since year end, are not yet leveling off. In June they rose

II -22
one per cent, and in early July the fifth increase in lead prices this
year was announced. The price of zinc may be raised shortly to restore
the customary differential between the domestic price and that on the
London Metal Exchange, and labor problems may reduce the supply of
other scarce nonferrous metals in the second half of this year.

f/ FRB grouping.
Steel mill products prices have advanced about 3.5 per cent
since December, and are going up further this month. Increases have
been announced for tires and industrial chemicals--which are now beginning
to move up more rapidly have also been announced.
Prices of farm products and foods rose substantially further
in June, reflecting large increases in livestock, meat, and eggs.
Marketings of livestock declined to a level below that of 1968 in
the quarter just ended. Livestock and meat prices have been fluctuating
at a very advanced level in recent weeks, and any marked decline seems

II -23
unlikely in view of potential supply. Although there may be some rise
in beef marketings in the months just ahead, pork production this fall
will be far below previous expectations. The total supply of red meat
this fall will almost certainly be less than a year ago and early winter
prices at wholesale are therefore unlikely to show the usual seasonal
decline.
Consumer prices. Consumer prices increased at an annual rate
of 3.6 per cent in May, much less rapidly than in March and April. The
slowdown is in part attributable to a moderation in the rise in service
costs, especially for home finance (mortgage interest, taxes and in-
surance), medical care, and utilities and public transportation. Among
the commodities, apparel and food prices continued to rise strongly in
May, but a decline in prices of automobiles, especially used cars, and
in gasoline provided a partial offset.
May retail food prices did not fully reflect recent increases
in food prices at wholesale. Consequently, a substantial further in-
crease probably occurred in June, and one may be anticipated in July,
partly reflecting seasonal factors.
A considerable part of the more rapid rise in the CPI this
year is attributable to the inflation in home prices, to a rise in
used car prices through April, and to rising mortgage interest, taxes,
and other home maintenance costs. The implicit deflator for consumer

II -24
expenditures in the GNP accounts, treats and weighs these components
quite differently and this partly accounts for the rise of only
3.6 per cent (annual rate) in the latter from the fourth to the first
quarter, compared to a 4.9 per cent increase in the CPI.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL SITUATION
Bank credit. Total commercial bank credit is estimated to
have declined slightly in June. Loans outstanding fell somewhat, as
business loans remained unchanged and the level of all other loans
fell slightly, on balance. The loan figures were reduced by sales of
loans by banks to affiliates, which amounted to $600 million during
the first three weeks in June. Bank holdings of securities also de-
clined slightly, reflecting reductions in holdings of municipal and
agency issues.

Outstanding business loans remained unchanged in spite of the
very large volume of corporate taxes due at mid-month and continued in-
ventory accumulation. While a large part of the recent sale of loans
by banks undoubtedly consisted of business loans, the failure of busi-
ness loans to rise in June may also reflect some repayment of bank loans
as demand shifted back to the commercial paper market following the
prime rate increase early in the month. In addition, business borrowing
during the tax and dividend period was less than usual as corporations
liquidated a large volume of CD's and other money market instruments
to meet tax payments, probably in response to the recent increase in
the cost of bank credit. There may also have been some anticipatory
borrowing to meet tax payments prior to the increase in the prime rate.
The June weakness in business loans was somewhat more pronounced at
banks in New York City, and was fairly widespread among industry
categories, although borrowing by metals producers and fabricators
was particularly small.
Growth of real estate loans slowed markedly further in
June, while consumer loans continued to expand at about the reduced
pace prevailing since year-end. Virtually all other major types of
loans declined.
Banks reduced their holdings of securities only nominally
in June, following substantial liquidation earlier in the year to
meet heavy loan demands in the face of deposit outflows. Bank
holdings of U.S. Government securities showed no change while holdings

III -3
of other securities--mainly municipals and agency issues--declined
slightly further. The relative stability of bank holdings of securi-
ties in June may reflect the reluctance of banks to reduce these
holdings much below current low levels.
Bank deposits. Total bank deposits declined rapidly in June,
and banks with foreign branches apparently preferred to augment their
funds available for loans by borrowing in the Euro-dollar market
rather than by reducing further their already low holdings of securi-
ties. In spite of Euro-dollar rates ranging from 10 to 12 per cent on
most maturities, bank liabilities to foreign branches rose by about
$3.5 billion in June, or more than the increase over the first five
months of the year.
The June decline in bank deposits consisted in large part in
heavy further CD attrition, although consumer-type time and savings
deposits also declined contraseasonally. Outstanding CD's at weekly
reporting banks fell by more than $1.7 billion in June, and New York
and Chicago banks lost another $234 million in the first week in July.
This brought the total decline since December 11 to more than $9.2 billion
or nearly 40 per cent of the amount of CD's outstanding at that time.

Consumer-type time and savings deposits at large banks fell
substantially further in June, following a small decline in May. The
fact that banks did not experience the rise in these deposits that
usually follows the outflows in April--associated with quarterly in-
terest crediting--may reflect the diversion of funds to market in-
struments in view of the current level of market rates of interest.
Most of the reduction in these deposits in May and June were in time
certificates and open accounts at New York City banks, although
outside banks also lost a sizable amount of regular savings deposits
in June. Inflows of time and savings deposits at country banks slowed
markedly in June, and were much less than in comparable periods of
other recent years.

III -5
With bank reserve positions under continuing pressure and
market rates increasing further, the money stock, measured on a
daily average basis, rose at only a 1.2 per cent annual rate in June.
However, the June increase would have been larger had it not been
for the rise in cash items in the process of collection (a deduction
item in calculating the money stock) associated with large increases
in bank borrowing in the Euro-dollar market through their foreign
branches. The June rise brought the annual rate of increase in the
money stock for the second quarter to about 2.9 per cent and the
increase for the first half of the year to 2.4 per cent. U.S. Govern-
ment deposits fell by $1.9 billion in June, bringing the average level
of these deposits to about that existing in December of last year.
Nonbank depositary intermediaries. With the rising level of
market yields, a further marked slowdown in the rate of growth of
savings and loan share capital occurred in June. Growth during the
second quarter was nearly halved from the first quarter rate. Patterns
of savings flow during the early days of the current reinvestment
period appear to have been similar to those of 1966. (Direct compari-
son of the savings and loan association experience with 1966 is not
possible because data were not collected for the grace days in that
year.) However, the grace period data may have become a premature
indicator of S&L reinvestment period flows because certificates often
come due on the first of the month. It is apparent, nevertheless,
that the current outflow from both savings and loans and mutual savings
banks is substantial.

Reports indicate that the reinvestment period experience so
far has been in line with industry projections, and the savings insti-
tutions apparently had prepared for this by reducing new mortgage
commitments. Savings and loan associations also increased their
advances from the FHL Banks by nearly $500 million during June--a
relatively large amount. In early July, a high rate of borrowing from
the FHL Banks continued, reducing the liquid resources of the FHLB
System on July 3 to $0.9 billion--$700 million below the end-of-May
level.
S&L borrowing from the FHLBB is expected to continue rising.
Commitments are very high relative to recent cash flow. Moreover, even
after the recent increase in advances, associations' borrowing as a
proportion of total S&L funds remains considerably below the 1966 peak.
Finally, the FHLBB has continued to emphasize its liberal lending
policy, and the Board plans to raise new funds in July and possibly in
August, though it has just increased the rates on both new and outstanding
advances to the 6.50-6.75 per cent range. In another action, the
FHLBB has announced its intention to advance funds with maturities of
5 years as opposed to the present one-year maximum. These long-term
funds would be financed by FHLBB issuance of notes of similar maturity,
the first of which is expected in August for about $200 million. 1/
1/ The procedure will be that associations will extend commitments
to borrow these long-term funds, at a maximum per S&L of 1 per
cent of share capital or $10 million, whichever is smaller. The
FHLBB will then issue notes only in the amount of total S&L
commitments received.

III -8
Mortgage market. With the capital markets generally con-
tinuing under heavy pressure and the critical savings reinvestment
period still under way, private mortgage lenders have apparently
remained quite selective. As a result, demands for FNMA's forward-
purchase commitments of Government-underwritten home mortgages, while
below their recent high, have continued much larger than usual, with
FNMA apparently accounting for the major--if not the sole--source of
new commitments for FHA and VA loans in numerous areas.
Intensified trade expectations of further increases in returns
on all types of mortgages, including an upward regulatory revision in
FHA and VA contract rates, have contributed to restrictive market con-
ditions, As an indication of the underlying pressures, secondary
market yields in FNMA's July 7 auction rose for the seventh consecutive
week, reaching a new high of 8.47 per cent. At that level, the larger
discounts on these fixed-rate mortgages have posed an even stronger
barrier to transactions in this sector of the market. Meanwhile,
following the hike in the bank prime rate early last month, additional
restraint on housing starts and other real estate activity has come
from increases--often of 100 basis points or more--in interest rates
on short-term construction loans as well as on interim mortgage ware-
housing credit.

These recent developments will undoubtedly continue the
shift in net mortgage lending that was already under way. During
the second quarter as a whole, net expansion in total mortgage debt--
which varies with both new credit extensions and loan repayments--
appears to have declined further from the record rate reached late
last year. The drop reflected a considerable reduction in net
lending by commercial banks--which nevertheless remained high--plus
an estimated further reduction in life insurance company net mortgage
acquisitions. Although net lending by savings banks dropped somewhat
also, S&L net mortgage acquisitions probably held close to, if not
moderately above, the volume attained earlier this year.

III -10
Corporate security and municipal bond markets. During
the last two weeks in June, corporate bond yields declined from recent
peaks as investors stepped up their demand and as underwriters priced
new issues somewhat more aggressively in light of this demand and
their smaller inventory positions. In the tax-exempt market also,
increased purchases by individuals and casualty insurance companies
combined with a sharply reduced calendar in this period to reduce
both the level of yields and the inventory position of dealers,
despite the virtual withdrawal of commercial banks from the market.
Stock prices, on the other hand, continued to fall sharply in the
second half of June, but recovered somewhat in the early days of
July.
1/ Effective July 7, the equity markets lengthened their trading
period by 30 mintues to 4-1/2 hours, still one hour short of
the traditional 5-1/2 hour trading day. The extension was
approved by the SEC in view of lighter trading and improve-
ment in the back-office log jam.

p/ Preliminary.
In very late June and early July, several factors combined
to put upward pressure on corporate yields again. Foremost among these
was a ballooning of new offerings, with at least two large issues
shifted forward from July to late June and several large industrial
and telephone issues newly announced for July. The staff now estimates

III -12
that total July offerings in the public bond market could total about
$1.3 billion, the largest volume since mid-1968. The increased volume
of corporate offerings does not seem to signify either a further
narrowing of the gap between internal funds generation and corporate
expenditures or issuer speculation on higher rates later. Rather
the erosion in corporate liquidity and cumulative reduction in credit
availability from both banks and the commercial paper market appears to
have shifted some large borrowers to the capital market.
In addition to the expanding new issue volume, the publicity
given Congressional testimony on interest rates and recent Federal
Reserve proposals on Eurodollars and Federal funds probably have also
influenced the behavior of some market participants. In any case,
several new issue syndicates--some of which were for new issues priced
ahead of the previously declining yields--were terminated in early
July with upward yield adjustments of 15 to 25 basis points.

Total corporate security offerings for July are estimated to
reach $2.6 billion, with the large volume of bond offerings supplemented
by an increased schedule of new stock issues. The further increase in
new equity offerings reflects a large issue scheduled by a major oil
company on top of the continued large volume of very small issues
reported in the last Greenbook. Estimates for August suggest a
continued relatively large volume of corporate security offerings,
after rough adjustment for seasonal factors; corporate volume tradi-
tionally declines significantly in August because of vacation schedules.
Yields in the tax-exempt market, where the forward calendar
remains unusually light, did not rise from late June levels during
early July. Although June new issues were somewhat larger than
originally projected, they remained considerably smaller than in other
recent months, and it is now estimated that July and August offerings
will also remain significantly below $1 billion.

The smaller volume reflects announced postponements and
issues failing to reach the offering stage because of the level of
yields. In many cases, State rate ceilings make it impossible for
local governments to bring new issues to market, but apparently some
of those with the flexibility to borrow have chosen to await a lower
level of yields.
Other short-term credit markets. During June, short-term
interest rates outside of the Treasury short-term bill market rose
sharply further. Rates on 4- to 6-month commercial paper have made
the greatest advances increasing from a level of 7.50 per cent at the
end of May to around 8.63 per cent most recently. Three-month finance

III -15
paper has also shown a significant rate increase to 7.50 per cent, an
increase of 62 basis points. At the beginning of the year, both of
these short-term instruments had been quoted at 6.25 per cent. The
three-month bankers' acceptance rate has also risen substantially from
7.50 per cent at the end of May to 8.50 on July 7.
The amount outstanding of commercial and finance paper
continued to increase markedly in May, although at a reduced pace
from April. The rise in such paper placed through dealers, representing
primarily corporate commercial paper issuance, totaled $165 million in
May compared to the $1.3 billion seasonally adjusted increase in April.
The volume of new issues placed through dealers picked up again in
early June in anticipation of the prime rate hike but then slackened
off late in the month and in early July.

Short-term rates in the Agency market have also shown sub-

offering of 9-month notes was priced to yield 7.90 per cent, compared
with a yield of 7.10 per cent on a comparable May 21 issue. Offerings
in the Agency market in May and June were quite heavy. These offerings
raised a total of $2,230 million of new money; this was $935 million
more than in May-June 1968 and only $284 million less than the
very large amount raised in May-June 1966, the previous period of
heavy Agency financing.

Delays in Congress on extension of the surtax contributed
to the market's weaker atmosphere; and the addition of several sizable
forthcoming new offerings in the corporate market also has put upward
pressure on Government yields. Finally, the System's recent announce-
ments of proposed marginal reserve requirements on Euro-dollar holdings
and proposed applicability of reserve requirements and Regulation Q to
certain types of Federal funds transactions caused some uncertainty in
the market as to the near-term course of interest rates and credit
availability.

III -20
In light of these developments, and with financing costs
remaining high--recently ranging generally between 9 and 10 per cent
in New York and 7--8-1/2 per cent on repurchase agreements out of
New York--dealers at times have sought to lighten their positions.
Professional selling, plus System purchases of $67 million of notes
and bonds on July 2, has helped to reduce dealer inventories of notes
and bonds somewhat. Between June 24 and July 8, holdings of coupon
issues declined $25 million on balance, as the table shows.

Bill rates have fluctuated widely in the last three weeks.
Actual and anticipated reinvestment demand from the over $950 million
of maturing 2-1/2 per cent bonds not exchanged in the May refunding
and from the $4.5 billion of June tax bills not turned in for taxes
tended to put downward pressure on yields in the latter half of June.
In the last few days of the month, bank window-dressing demand for
the mid-year statement date tended to depress rates temporarily.

III -21
The bulk of the demand for bills during this period was concentrated
in the shorter maturities, and in consequence, dealers ran down their
holdings of bills due within 92 days to large net short positions in
late June, at one time to deeper than $600 million.
More recently, dealers' holdings of shorter bills have been
replenished somewhat, reflecting some professional short covering
as well as some customer selling, including reversal of window-dressing
operations. In an already nervous market, this recent selling, com-
bined with the prospect of a large supply of new issues, has put
renewed upward pressure on bill yields.
The Treasury announced its July cash financing plans a few
days earlier than generally had been expected. The debt managers are
auctioning a total of $3.5 billion of tax anticipation bills--$1.75
billion of December tax bills on Wednesday, and another $1.75
billion of March maturities on Friday. Commercial banks may pay for
their awards in full by crediting tax and loan accounts, which are
estimated by the market to have an average life of 8 or 9 days. The
payment date for both issues is July 18.
Federal finance. From preliminary June budget data, it
now appears that the fiscal 1969 budget was in surplus by about $1
billion. This was the amount predicted by Budget Director Mayo in
his May 20 review, but the levels of receipts and expenditures, which
appear to be $187 billion and $186 billion, respectively, would each

III -22
be about $500 million higher than the Administration's forecasts. To
insure this surplus, the CCC issued $700 million of participation
certificates, which were offset against expenditures under last year's
accounting practices.
As had been expected, the Treasury cash balance was $5.9
billion at the end of June, but revised estimates of third quarter cash
flows--mainly due to larger anticipated outlays indicate a tighter
Treasury cash situation during this quarter than had been anticipated
in the last Greenbook. The Treasury is offering $3-1/2 billion of tax
bills in early July and will probably raise about $1-1/2 billion of
additional cash in August. Even with $5 billion of new cash raised
during July and August, the operating balance could fall below $1
billion in mid-September before the quarterly tax receipts buoy it to
a comfortable level. Toward the end of July, the Treasury will be
announcing plans to rerund $3.2 billion of publicly-held coupon
issues maturing in mid-August.
A recent House-Senate conference agreement on the fiscal
1970 spending ceiling provides a target ceiling of $191.9 billion,
one billion below the Administration estimate. The ceiling is cushioned
by allowance for $2 billion of overruns in specified uncontrollable
categories; but overruns in excess of this amount would have to be
offset by cuts in other programs. In addition, Congress will change
the level of the ceiling if it approves spending authority different

III -23
from the Administration's April requests. The format of this
spending ceiling suggests that the Administration's $192.9 billion
estimate of 1970 outlays is a reasonable projection at this time.

U.S. balance of payments. The over-all structure of U.S.
international transactions to mid-year has been dominated by flows of
liquid capital and the after-effects of the dock strike. Outflows of
mobile funds from the United States were already a principal factor in
the spurt of the deficit on the liquidity basis to $1.7 billion
(seasonally adjusted) in the first quarter and contributed greatly to
the estimated $4 billion deficit in the second quarter. However, there
was a large surplus on the liquidity basis in the last few days of June,
suggesting that there had been at least a temporary reversal of the flow.
Although the reasons for such outflows are readily apparent --
especially in May speculation on a German mark revaluation and very
high yields on Euro-dollar deposits in June -- they seem to be taking
forms that tend to escape the normal process of statistical reporting.
Consequently the size of the flows can only be inferred by comparing
the measured changes in U.S. reserves and liquid liabilities to foreigners
with such estimates as can be made at this time of the course of the
usual current and capital transactions. For the first half of 1969,

IV -2
as a very rough order of magnitude, outflows motivated by expectations
of DM revaluation or by an opportunity for high yields could account
for half, or perhaps somewhat more, of the nearly $6 billion liquidity
deficit. If so, the liquidity deficit resulting from all other trans-
actions in the first half of the year would still be very high -- at an
annual rate well in excess of $4 billion.
In May and again in June the monthly liquidity deficit (not
seasonally adjusted) reached about $1.5 billion, but the financing of
the deficit changed drastically. In May there was only a minor increase
in U.S. liabilities to commercial banks abroad, but liabilities to
foreign official accounts rose by $1.5 billion, as most of the flow of
funds from the United States, and from other countries as well, went
into German official reserves. By the middle of May funds were moving
out of Germany, some with forward cover back into marks, and, together
with fresh outflows from the United States and other countries, were
being lodged in the Euro-dollar market, where the intense demand for
funds, chiefly by U.S. banks, was driving up interest rates. Consequently
in June there was a decline of some $2-1/4 billion in U.S. liabilities to
foreign official accounts, but a rise approaching $4 billion in liabilities
to commercial banks abroad, including an increase of about $3-1/2 billion
in liabilities to foreign branches of U.S. banks.
For the second quarter as a whole, it is estimated on the basis
of incomplete data that the liquidity deficit of about $4 billion was

IV -3
financed by an increase in liabilities to private foreign accounts of
nearly $5 billion (very largely as liabilities to foreign branches), a
decrease of somewhat over $1/2 billion in liquid liabilities to foreign
official accounts, and a small gain in reserve assets.
Although the nature of the outflow of funds from the United
States that contributed to the supply of funds in the Euro-dollar market
is obscure, it seems likely that part of what we have been seeing is a
circular flow of funds normally held directly in the United States
(including perhaps foreign funds held here but not ordinarily identified
as foreign) but now redeposited abroad to escape the interest rate ceiling.
Apart from the distortions of the accounts resulting from
abnormal movements into German marks or into Euro-dollar deposits, there
remains a disturbingly large liquidity deficit. Part of the worsening
in the second-quarter deficit is identifiable as a shift in claims on
foreigners by U.S. banks from an inflow (seasonally adjusted) of $70
million in the first quarter to an outflow of perhaps $300 million in
the second. (The latter number involves an assumption, based on very
partial information, that the net flow in June was negligible.) In
April-May, when there were sizable bank credit outflows, the principal
recipients were France, Germany, Canada, Israel and Korea; claims on
Japan, by far the largest single borrower, did not change significantly.
It has been reported that some lending has occurred under long-standing
commitments, presumably reflecting the sharp rise in the cost of
borrowing in the Euro-dollar market since April.

IV -4
Foreign purchases of U.S. corporate securities (including new
issues sold abroad) have dropped off sharply from the $1.2 billion
recorded in the first quarter. Net purchases of corporate equities in
the U.S. market in May were over $150 million; this was larger than the
amounts purchased in March or April, but considerably short of the peak
inflows of earlier months. There is no reliable evidence yet of the net
balance of these stock market dealings in June, but the total for the
quarter was certainly far less than the inflow of over $700 million in
the first quarter. Sales of new issues by U.S. corporations in foreign
markets were also greatly reduced in the second quarter, and probably
totalled about $100 million compared to $400 million in the first
quarter. (These figures include sales of securities abroad by foreign
affiliates to the extent the proceeds are for use in the United States.)
Among other known features of the second quarter transactions,
sales of new foreign bonds in the U.S. market were unusually low at
about $250 million, half the first-quarter amount, reflecting the
tightening of the securities market here. There is a continuing moderate
outflow of U.S. capital to purchase foreign corporate stocks, and this
was probably somewhat higher in the second quarter than in the first.
It seems likely that the outflow of direct investment capital was larger
in the second quarter following the relatively subdued outflow in the
earlier months of the year. Such outflows may reflect part of the flow
into German marks, if U.S. parent companies took the opportunity to

IV -5
advance funds to their German affiliates to reduce DM debt or acquire
DM assets. Also, the second-quarter deficit was probably worsened by
a faster rise in income payments to foreigners than in income received.
As noted below, the turnaround from a merchandise trade deficit in the
first quarter to a surplus in April-May, as the effects of the dock
strike were reversed, was quite small; probably the quarter-to-quarter
gain in the trade balance was only a few hundred million dollars.
As a result of the huge flow of liquid funds into the Euro-
dollar market after mid-May out of other currencies, the U.S. official
reserve transactions balance moved into surplus once again. For the
month of June the surplus on this basis was about $2-1/2 billion, and
for the entire second quarter it was about $1-1/4 billion. U.S. reserve
liabilities, liquid and non-liquid, were reduced by about $1 billion
in the quarter, and reserve assets rose by about $300 million.
U.S. foreign trade. The trade balance in May (balance of
payments basis) was in deficit, as exports fell while imports rose.
For the first five months, the trade balance was a net deficit of about
$1/4 billion at an annual rate, compared with the $1/2 billion rate of
export surplus in the last half of 1968 as measured by recently revised
figures. The main explanation for this worsening is the dock strike of
December-March.
The permanent loss of trade due to the strike was probably
greater for exports than for imports, perhaps $500 million for exports --
$300 million in agricultural goods and $200 million in other types -- and

IV -6
of about $200 million for imports. Port congestion was apparently still
slowing cargo movements in June. It has been reported that the railroads
were still limiting shipments to West Gulf ports in late May -- nearly
two months after the ending of the strike in those ports. Rough estimates
indicate that there were still backlogs of $1/2 to $3/4 billion or more
each of exports and imports remaining to be moved after May as a result
of the strike-induced delays.
Exports in April and May were both above "normal" but not
sufficiently to recoup the strike losses of the first quarter. In
January-May exports were at an annual rate of $33.4 billion (balance
of payments basis), moderately below the rate in the second half of
1968. Shipments to Western Europe in January-May were at a rate about
5 per cent less than in the last half of 1968; exports to Japan were
slightly lower. Exports to Europe and Japan had expanded sharply from
the first to the second half of 1968 -- 11 and 5 per cent respectively --
and continued growth was expected in view of the economic boom in Europe
and continued expansion in Japanese output.
The failure of exports of machinery to rise further in
April-May after a sharp pickup in March with the ending of the strike
is particularly surprising. Export orders for such equipment had risen
sharply in 1968 and these should have been reflected in expanded deliveries
by now. The sharp drop in shipments to Europe and the sluggishness in
machinery exports through May both suggest that there had been only a
partial recovery from the effects of the dock strike.

IV -7
As noted in the previous Green Book, a decline in commercial
aircraft exports began to develop in April. This is likely to go
considerably further later this year, until Boeing 747's begin to be
shipped in volume, and may significantly retard the expected rise in
the trade balance.
Imports in April-May were also estimated to be inflated by
post-strike influences, but January-May imports at an annual rate of
$33.6 billion (balance of payments basis) were below the rate in the
second half of 1968. Imports of automobiles and other nonfood consumer
goods were up, but imports of foods and industrial materials were down.
The increase in consumer goods possibly reflects the importance of
Japan, Hong Kong and Taiwan as suppliers of such products and their
access to the West Coast ports, not affected by the strike. Imports
of cars from Japan have been particularly strong this year. Sales of
Toyotas and Datsuns in the United States were more than twice as large
in the first five months as in the year-earlier period. Arrivals of
cars from Canada have also increased.
Since economic activity in Europe and Japan has expanded
sharply this year, and output and consumption in the United States
remain strong, clearly it is not lack of demand that lies behind the
relatively low aggregate January-May levels of both exports and imports.
Rather it may be that insufficient time has elapsed since the ending of
the dock strike -- between 2 to 3 months -- for the ports to handle

IV -8
the tremendous backlog of goods accumulated during the strike. Trade
movements in April and May were at record amounts and it may be that
for one reason or another, port operations have been as large as they
could be. It is likely that exceptionally high rates of trade movements
in both directions may continue for several more months, not only because
of the cargo backlog but also because of the demands generated by
continuing economic growth here and abroad.
Foreign exchange markets. The usual mid-year strengthening
in demand for major foreign currencies -- associated with the repatriation
of funds by foreign commercial banks to meet late-June domestic liquidity
needs -- did not materialize this year in face of the strong pull of
extremely high Euro-dollar rates. After a week's lull, the flow of funds
from German marks resumed on June 24, since which date the Bundesbank
has sold about $450 million on an outright spot basis. The Bundesbank
has done no swap business since June 11 when it raised its swap rate to
a level uncompetitive with the market forward rate.
The ordinarily large mid-year flow of funds into Swiss francs
was apparently damped this year by the attractiveness of Euro-dollar
yields. The Swiss National Bank did $250 million of dollar/franc swaps
with Swiss commercial banks, which acquired an additional $280 million
through the central bank discount window. But Swiss banks did not
repatriate any dollars to sell outright to the BNS as had been expected.

IV -9
The Dutch guilder and Belgian franc have continued under moderate
selling pressure, presumably reflecting the movement of funds into Euro-
dollars. So far in July the Netherlands Bank has lost about $45 million.
On July 2 it announced it is taking measures to moderate the impact of
high Euro-dollar rates on capital flows from the Netherlands. It is
requiring Dutch commercial banks to adjust their net foreign asset
positions so that their average net positions during the second half of
1969 will be 10 per cent less than the level of end-May or the average
of March and April.
Selling pressure against the French franc moderated briefly
late in June. However, it resumed about July 3 and the Bank of France
lost about $100 million in the first six trading days of July. Also,
the Italian lira, which had been generally firm during June with the
Bank of Italy making very small dollar purchases, weakened substantially
beginning July 7 in response to political uncertainty in Italy. Although
the Bank of Italy so far has not intervened in the exchange market, the
lira rate has fallen sharply to a point just about its lower limit.
The demand for sterling has remained generally firm since mid-
Hay. The Bank of England purchased just over $300 million in the market
in June, and so far in July it has purchased $65 million.
The price of gold remained steady at about $41.00 an ounce
from mid-June until late the first week of July when it began to rise,
reportedly reflecting demand connected with the governmental instability
in Italy. On July 9 the price of gold was $41.90 an ounce.

IV -10
Euro-dollar market. Euro-dollar deposit rates in most maturities
advanced moderately as the end of June neared, and then dropped sharply on
June 27, perhaps in reaction to the Federal Reserve's proposed imposition
of reserve requirements on Euro-dollar borrowings as well as the passing
of mid-year pressures. During the first week of July, Euro-dollar rates
advanced rather sharply; call deposit rates rose 2 per cent and rates on
maturities between one month and one year advanced an average of 3/4 per
cent. Early in the second week of July, however, rates in most maturities
declined by about half as much as they had increased the previous week.
On July 9, call and one-month deposits were bid at about 10-1/4 per cent,
three-, and six-month deposits at about 11 per cent, and the twelve-month
rate was 10-3/8 per cent.
Liabilities of U.S. banks to their foreign branches reached
$13.6 billion on the last Wednesday of June, having increased $3.6 billion
in four weeks. In the following week, to July 2, liabilities to branches
declined by $475 million -- a decline only about half as large as that
recorded at the end of the first quarter. As of July 7, however, liabilities
to branches had again increased by nearly $800 million from their level of
July 2, according to preliminary data.

Financial developments in other industrial countries. Financial
markets, except in Japan, have been tightening in recent months. Interest
rates for all maturities in nearly every industrial nation are at or
near their high for the year (see Table) and, indeed, for the decade.
Other monetary indicators also show a consistent pattern of increasing
tightness in almost all of these countries.
These tightening financial conditions have generally resulted
in each country from the same set of factors, although the relative
importance of each factor has varied from country to country. On the
one hand, the high--and increasing--level of aggregate demand in every
country except the U.K. has been accompanied by a strong--and increasing--
demand for credit. At the same time, the monetary authorities, increasingly
fearful of inflationary pressures, have acted in a variety of ways to
restrict the supply of credit. In addition, international capital
movements have tended to extend tightness in one market to all of the
others. Most significant in this connection is the Euro-dollar market,
in which the unprecedentedly high interest rates have exerted a restrictive
influence on domestic financial markets, either directly or by inducing
domestic monetary authorities to take restrictive actions to protect
their foreign exchange reserves.
The outlook for monetary conditions in the industrial countries
over the next few months depends partly on monetary developments in the
U.S. and their repercussions on the Euro-dollar market. However, it is

unlikely that inflationary pressures will abate significantly in the
next few months in any country, and in some they are likely to intensify.
Monetary policies in all countries will be designed to maintain tight
financial conditions. This will certainly be the case in Belgium,
Canada, France, the Netherlands, and the Scandinavian countries--where
both internal and external considerations call for a restrictive policy
posture--and in the U.K.--where external considerations will continue
to require tightness and will dominate domestic policy objectives. The
German authorities face a classic fixed exchange rate conflict between
internal balance (calling for restrictive measures) and external balance
(requiring expansionary measures); the authorities appear to be placing
increasingly high priority on domestic stabilization objectives. In
Italy, the authorities have adopted, and are maintaining, a restrictive
posture--in anticipation of, rather than in response to, inflationary
pressures; the same may soon be true in Japan.
Thus, financial conditions are likely to remain very tight in
the major industrial countries over the next several months. One
implication of this is that the supply of funds from these countries to
the Euro-dollar market will probably not increase substantially. If,
however, the demand for Euro-dollar funds (largely by U.S. banks) were
to diminish and Euro-dollar rates were to decline somewhat, reflows of
funds to these countries would tend not only to reduce pressure on their
international reserve positions but also to offset the domestic impact
of restrictive monetary policies.

IV -15
German interest rates have risen significantly since the
beginning of the year, as the Bundesbank has gradually tightened its
credit policy. This shift in policy in response to rising inflationary
pressures has been constrained by the need to export long-term capital
as an offset to Germany's large foreign trade surplus. In the first five
months of this year, the net long-term capital outflow was $2.15 billion,
of which $888 million consisted of foreign bond issues. In June, foreign
bond issues totaled an estimated $65 million.
Pressures on economic resources have apparently built up to
levels recorded at the peaks of the 1961 and 1965 booms. The inflationary
potential was aggravated in April-May by the large speculative inflow of
capital and the consequent large injection of liquidity into the German
economy. A large part of the inflow took the form of increased foreign
liabilities of non-banks (primarily loans from foreigners or foreign
prepayment of exports); non-banks sold the foreign exchange accruing to
them, and used the proceeds to pay off outstanding liabilities or deposited
them with the German commerical banks. The resulting increase in the
banks' deposit liabilities was thus subject only to the standard reserve
requirements--not to the 100 per cent marginal requirement applicable to
increases in foreign liabilities. An improvement of about DM 10 billion
in the liquidity position of the banks in May more than offset a drain of
DM 8.5 billion in February-April; the ratio of "free liquid" reserves to
deposits rose from 11.7 per cent at the end of April to 14.9 per cent at
the end of May, compared to 14.2 per cent at the end of January.

IV -16
In June, however, there was a sharp increase in interest rates,
due to seasonal pressures, higher reserve requirements (announced May 22),
and the pull of the Euro-dollar market. German commercial banks built
up their gross short-term foreign asset position by an estimated $900 mil-
lion in the period June 1-15. By mid-June German short-term market rates
were substantially higher than the prevailing discount rate of 4 per cent,
and banks were discounting heavily at the Bundesbank. On June 19, the
discount rate was raised from 4 to 5 per cent, the second full percentage
point increase in three months. Following this, short-term rates rose
even further.
The May increase in bank liquidity and the shifting of speculative
foreign funds into long-term DM paper caused yields on the German capital
market to steady, after rising 20 basis points in March-April. In the
second week of June, however, the average yield on 6 per cent public
authority bonds rose another 28 basis points, to 6.70 per cent.
Interest rates in Germany during the next several months will
clearly remain higher than they were prior to the June discount action.
Contributing to this is the reduction of banks' rediscount quotas, announced
on March 20, which became effective on July 1.
In the United Kingdom short-term interest rates rose in March,
slipped back in April, and rose again in May in connection with the rush
into DM. In June rates eased, largely in response to the strengthening
of sterling and the absence of a rise in the discount rate which had been
widely expected prior to publication of improved May trade figures.

IV -17
Long-term yields on government bonds rose almost continuously from
8.50 per cent in mid-February to 9.50 per cent in mid-June, although
they, too, receded in the latter part of June as the outlook for the
pound appeared to brighten.
Banks are apparently feeling some pressure on their liquidity
positions. The liquidity ratio of two of the clearing banks fell below
the required floor of 28 per cent in the month from mid-April to mid-May.
This pressure is due in part to the surplus the central government has
been running in recent months.
Aggregate demand in Britain dropped from the fourth quarter of
1968 to the first quarter of 1969, and there was at best a very limited
recovery in the second quarter. In spite of this, the authorities have
clearly been pursuing a tight monetary policy. The Bank of England insists
that the clearing banks reduce their lending to the private sector to
98 per cent of the amount outstanding in November 1967. This target,
scheduled to be reached in March, has still not been met, though the banks
came within 1 per cent of it in June. In a further effort to urge
compliance by the banks, the Bank of England early in June halved the
interest it pays on the special deposits the clearing banks must maintain
at the Bank. Moreover, the Bank has been allowing yields on government
bonds to rise, instead of supporting bond prices (as it sometimes did in
the past) and thus nullifying attempts to keep the expansion of the
money supply in check.

IV -18
The prospects for the next several months are for continued
tight monetary policies. The "letter of intent," sent by the Chancellor
to the IMF in connection with the $1 billion stand-by credit to the U.K.,
specified a goal of limiting domestic credit expansion to £400 million
in 1969-70, compared to £1,225 million in 1968-69. The public sector as
a whole is expected to be a net repayer of debt in this fiscal year.
However, some expansion in credit to the private sector is apparently
anticipated, presumably as a result of loans exempted from the 98 per cent
ceiling (special loans to finance exports and shipbuilding).
Interest rates in France advanced steadily during the first
half of this year, with the largest increases recorded at short-term
maturities. The 12-month Treasury bill yield increased from 7.37 per
cent in early November to 10.20 per cent on June 25. Similarly, the
day-to-day money market rate, which is the most meaningful short-term
rate, but is closely controlled by the Bank of France, rose steadily from
end-January through June. The yield on public sector bonds moved
erratically upward from January to May, but then eased slightly in June.
These financial developments in France have been the result of a high
level of demand for credit and a progressive tightening of monetary
policy; French exchange controls have blocked the direct transmission of
monetary stringency from other countries. The demand for credit reflects
the buoyancy of the French economy, especially the consumer boom and the
rapid expansion of private sector investment.

IV -19
After the November 1968 crisis, reserve requirements were
increased, credit ceilings were imposed, and the discount rate was
increased. This tightening of monetary policy was not reinforced, however,
by any additional fiscal restraint, and the consumer and import boom
continued unabated. Further credit restraint was imposed, in the form of
an extension of the short-term credit ceiling, another increase in the
discount rate (to 7 per cent), and an effort to slow the expansion of
medium-term credit for investment in other than export industries.
Although present conditions in France make policy predictions
very uncertain, it is reasonable to expect that monetary policy will
continue to carry the burden of restraining the economy, since fiscal
restraint runs a greater risk of jeopardizing the wage negotiations and
social order in general. Further credit tightening will probably occur,
and interest rates in the early fall may be even higher than they are now.
Insofar as internal objectives are concerned, Italian monetary
policy has remained unchanged in recent months. At present, the authorities
seek to maintain the rate of expansion of demand and output that has
prevailed since the latter part of 1968. Expansion has been fairly rapid
by most standards, but the remaining unused capacity has prevented any
rapid rise in pressure on resources. The basic continuity in monetary
policy orientation is reflected in the stability of long-term yields--
these are considered by Italian monetary authorities as the most
important variable in the control of domestic spending.

IV -20
Towards the end of March, Italian banks were instructed to
liquidate by June 30 their net foreign assets, then amounting to
approximately $800 million. This directive was interpreted as being
designed in part to keep Italian credit conditions from tightening in
response to Euro-dollar market pressures and prospects of increased
Treasury borrowing this year; but since a similar effect could have been
produced by other means (e.g., additional Bank of Italy advances), the
dominant motive apparently was to bolster official reserves. Italian
banks reduced their net foreign assets by a total of $272 million in April-
May, and presumably reduced them substantially further in June. However,
the Bank of Italy apparently allowed some $200 million to remain outstanding
after June 30, perhaps for a lengthy period, depending on balance of
payments developments.
The upward trend of interest rates in Belgium, which had been
very rapid from September 1968 to March 1969, slowed considerably in
April and May, but intensified in June.
Conditions in the Euro-dollar market, the rising level of economic
activity, and central bank actions all contributed to this development. The
Euro-dollar market did not exert a pull directly on the commercial banks
after they were instructed in early April to reduce their foreign positions
by an estimated $150 million by June 1. However, the Euro-dollar market
did affect non-banks, and thus contributed to tighter monetary conditions.

IV -21
The National Bank raised its discount rate by three half-point
jumps on March 6, April 10, and May 29--from 4.5 to 6 per cent--primarily
to protect Belgium's official reserves. However, domestic considerations
also played a role in the May 29 rise, which was designed to reinforce
newly-imposed limits on loans to domestic borrowers. These limits should
lead to a substantial slowing of credit expansion this year.
Interest rates in the Netherlands have risen sharply since the
end of last year, as authorities have moved to curb strong inflationary
pressures in the economy. The discount rate was increased in two steps
to 5.5 per cent (the highest level in forty years), credit ceilings have
been imposed, and installment purchase regulations have been made more
severe. These actions have been complemented by a tightening of fiscal
policy and the imposition of price controls.
Dutch authorities were not unhappy about pressure exerted by
high Euro-dollar rates, to the extent that this reinforced their own
restrictive policies. Heavy reserve losses in June, however, prompted
the Netherlands Bank, on July 2, to request that commercial banks keep
their net foreign exchange positions down to the level of end-May or the
average of March and April; during the second half of 1969, the net
position must, on average, be lowered by 10 per cent of this level.
Short-term interest rates in Switzerland have been rising since
early February, and the current rate of 5 per cent on 3-month bank deposits
contrasts with the low of 4 per cent last winter. The composite yield on
long-term government bonds is at a high of 4.7 per cent, up from around
4.4 per cent at the start of the year.

IV -22
This rise in interest rates has probably been caused mostly by
the rise in rates outside the country. There has, however, also been an
acceleration in the demand for bank credit.
Monetary and credit policies in the Scandinavian countries are
currently directed at moderating the rate of expansion of aggregate demand,
to prevent economic overheating. In Norway, central bank credit policy
has been restrictive for some time, and has recently been tightened
further. In Sweden--and especially in Denmark--central bank policy has
been significantly tightened because of pressures on foreign reserves, which
reached crisis proportions in the case of Denmark in April and May.
Money-market conditions in Japan have remained relatively easy
in recent months, mainly as a result of the Treasury's cash deficit and the
balance of payments surplus. The average interest rate charged by banks
leveled off at 7.36 per cent in February-April following a decline from
the July 1968 peak of 7.52 per cent. The bond market, on the other hand,
has been bearish; yields on telegraph and telephone bonds increased from
8.66 per cent in December to 8.96 per cent in April. (The market for
these bonds is relatively unregulated, and is, therefore, a good indication
of capital market forces.)
The economy is experiencing a persistent expansion in final demand.
Indeed, there is some concern that the economy may be entering a period
of overheating. Although a seasonal shortage of funds, expected in
July and August, will be offset by the Bank of Japan, the Bank may raise
its discount rate this fall.

IV -23
In recent weeks money and capital markets have tightened
significantly in Canada. The average tender rate on three-month Treasury
bills rose in April, steadied during May, then rose again following the
June 11 increase in the Bank of Canada's discount rate (to 7.50 per cent).
Long-term interest rates also rose in the second quarter; the average
yield on government bonds increased from 7.23 per cent in early April
to 7.60 per cent on June 11, before easing slightly.
Commercial banks have come under increasing pressure as strong
loan demand and a restrictive monetary policy have led to a sharp rundown
in the banks' liquid assets. The chartered banks increased their prime
rates to 8 per cent immediately following the discount rate increase on
June 11 and, two weeks later, increased their rates to 8.50 per cent. There
are reports that banks are turning away loans they would have made two
months ago.
The pressure on interest rates in Canada reflects a variety of
market forces: strong credit demands associated with a booming economy, a
restrictive monetary policy, and an outflow of short-term funds. The
foreign currency "swapped" deposits at Canadian banks increased by nearly
C$500 million in the seven weeks following end-April. Canadian banks have
moved these funds into the New York inter-bank market, more than offsetting
the movement of U.S. non-bank funds to Canada, and accounting for the recent
weakening of the spot and strengthening of the forward Canadian dollar.

IV -24
Short-term rates may rise further before there is a significant
turnaround; long-term rates, however, may well be at or near their peak.
The recent government budget, with its projected budgetary surplus for
FY 1969-70, will substantially reduce the Federal Governments' demands on
the capital market. In addition, there are some signs of a slowing in the
rate of economic growth (and, with that, a possible erosion of inflationary
expectations), even though the rate of real growth in Canada in the second
half of 1969 is likely to be higher than that in the U.S.

APPENDIX A: ANNUAL PAYROLL EMPLOYMENT REVISIONS*
Revisions of the payroll employment, hours, and earnings series
to reflect new benchmarks (annual adjustments to full reports from the
Social Security Administration and other sources), and new seasonal
adjustment factors were introduced by the BLS with the preliminary June
data on July 8. The benchmark revisions were minor in most industry
sectors; the single exception was State and local government empldyment 1/
which had been substantially overstated by the basic estimating equations.-
In the private sector, revisions were small and should not cause large
modifications of series which are heavily dependent on the employment
data, such as the productivity measures and private wage and salary
estimates. The introduction of revised seasonal factors did not signi-
ficantly alter the overall pattern of employment growth, although it
did tend to smooth several of the more erratic series, especially con-
struction.

APPENDIX B: POPULATION TRENDS*
Marriages have continued to surge thus far in 1969 and the
birth rate has moved up, at least temporarily. If current trends
continue, this year will record the end of the 12-year decline in the
rate of population growth.

Marriages. The number of marriages moved above the 2 million
mark in 1968 for the first time since 1946, and the marriage rate, which
began to advance rapidly in 1963, increased to 10.3 per 1,000 total
population from 9.5 in 1966, and 9.0 in 1964. Most of the acceleration
in the marriage rate occurred after mid-1968 when many young persons
graduated from school and found jobs readily available.
The upper trend in marriages has continued this year. The
number married in the first 4 months of 1969 was higher than in the same
period a year earlier and th marriage rate averaged 10.4 per 1,000
population (seasonally adjusted), slightly above the 1968 rate. Moreover,

demographic factors continue very favorable to a further rise in marriages.
The population in the prime marriage ages of 18 to 24 will increase
by nearly 800,000 this year compared with 600,000 in 1968.
Births. The sustained rise in marriages and the burgeoning
growth in the number of women in the younger childbearing ages has
finally led to a rise in the rate and number of births this year. In
the first 4 months of 1969, births were up 4 per cent from the same
period a year ago.
The rise in the birth rate early in 1969 to 17.6 per 1,000
total population, appears likely to mark the first firm upturn since
the downtrend began in 1957. The upsurge in marriages has been reflected
in a rise in the number of first births. Although some young newlyweds
may delay starting a family, the cumulative effect of the rise in the
number of young married couples has provided the impetus to a rise in
births this year as was projected by the C nsus Bureau under its lowest
fertility assumption.
Population. The population increased by 2.0 millior or 1 per
cent from January 1, 1968 to January 1, 1969. This was the lowest rate
in 28 years and contrasts sharply with the 1.8 per cent rate achieved
in 1956, when the birth rate was at a very high level. With the rise
in births during the first 4 months this year, the annual rate of popu-
lation growth has also begun to inch up month-by-month from the January
1969 low.
Outlook. Because of the post World War II baby boom, the
number of women entering marriage and childbearing ages will continue
to increase rapidly over the next decade. In the age group 20 to 29
yars, where childbearing is most heavily concentrated, the projected
increase is from 14.3 million in 1968 to 15.5 million in 1970 and 18.3
million in 1975. Reflecting this trend, the number of marriages per
year is projected to increase from less than 2.1 million in 1968 to about
2.4 million in 1975. Unless birth rates fall drastically further, the
effect of the population swing and more marriages is likely to bring a
strong, continuing upsurge in the number of births in the early 1970's.
