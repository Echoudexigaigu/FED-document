SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK
Outlook for economic activity
There continues to be considerable current strength in the
economy, with industrial production rising at a rapid pace and price
pressures widespread. Nevertheless, evidence of growing imbalances
between output and consumption is increasing. The unemployment rate
has moved up from its year-end lows, new orders for durable goods have
declined further, and retail sales have remained sluggish with real
consumer takings continuing below year-ago levels. Informal surveys
of anticipated capital outlays, including preliminary findings from
the Federal Reserve Banks, also suggest that in the current environment
of slower economic growth and restricted funds availability, business-
men's expectations are apparently undergoing change and plans for future
spending are more tentative than earlier this year.
These recent developments seem consistent with expectations
of further slackening of real growth in the second half of the year.
However, prospects are that the over-all gain in current dollar GNP
this quarter may be nearly as large as in the second quarter, mainly
because of the temporary impetus expected from the Federal pay increase.
But retail sales in July appear to have changed little from June, while
unit auto sales fell off.
Slowing of expansive forces should become more evident as
plant and equipment expenditures begin to moderate, as suggested by the
earlier Commerce-SEC survey. Also the increasing impact of credit

I- 2
restraint and high interest rates portends a continued downward trend
in residential construction outlays later this year and early 1970.
With new orders for defense goods down recently, defense outlays prob-
ably will also continue to decline. Little further increase is expected
in Federal non-defense spending, and financial stringencies seem likely
to slow somewhat the uptrend in State-local outlays.
By the fourth quarter most sectors should be contributing to
slower economic growth. If the rise in final sales slows as much as
projected, it seems unlikely that businessmen will continue to accumu-
late large stocks of goods for any significant length of time and some
downward adjustment in stock-building could be underway at or before
year-end. Without the underpinning provided by continued large inventory
accumulation, real growth probably will turn negative in the first half
of next year, and the rise in prices and costs should moderate.
Outlook for resource use and prices
Industrial production in July again increased considerably,
about matching estimated growth in capacity--as has been the case so
far this year. In July, the upward thrust came mainly from business
equipment and autos, and from the supporting materials industries
including steel. Auto producers are now in their model change-over
period, which has been allowed for in the index. This means that even
if advanced production schedules are met through September, no further
lift to the index may be expected from this industry. However, the
backlog of unfilled orders in the machinery and equipment industry is

I- 3
still large, suggesting further output increases in this sector
Altogether, it appears that industrial production this quarter will
show a sizable advance, but not as large as the 6 per cent annual rate
of the second quarter. Later in the year and in the first half of
1970, as both final sales of goods and inventory accumulation slow
markedly, industrial production is likely to level out and then decline,
and the capacity utilization rate by mid-1970 is expected to be well
below its present level.
The labor market continues tight, even though the unemployment
rate has moved up from 3.3 per cent in the first quarter to 3.6 per cent
in July. Some portents of future easing include the recent increases in
initial unemployment claims and the related rise in July in the unemploy-
ment rate for adult men. Increases in nonfarm employment have not been
as rapid as earlier this year, but the July increase at an annual rate
of about 2 million was still large. The projected slowing of real GNP
growth over the next year will likely be accompanied by much more slowing
in employment increases and a significant rise in the unemployment rate.
Settlements in recent contract negotiations have been very
large, particularly in construction, but these negotiations have
involved relatively few workers and the over-all rise in average hourly
earnings has slowed. At the same time, manufacturing profits before
taxes, and profit margins, apparently declined in the second quarter;
the current projections of GNP and industrial output suggest that
profits in manufacturing and elsewhere are likely to come under sub-
stantial downward pressure over the year ahead.

I- 4
The current price situation is not reassuring, although
wholesale prices of livestock declined after mid-July following a sharp
run-up. Industrial prices increased moderately from mid-June to mid-
July despite further declines in lumber. Since then there have been
sizable increases in prices of steel and copper. Consumer prices
advanced sharply in June, but foods are unlikely to continue to provide
as much of an upward push to the total index as they did in that month.
Over the next year we have projected a moderate slowing of the pace of
price increase, as measured by the GNP deflator. This slowing is pred-
icated on the prospective weakening of over-all demands and the easing
in resource use. But rising labor costs--reflecting slowing of produc-
tivity gains, and already built-in pressures for higher wages--will be
exerting pressure on sellers.
Outlook for credit demands
Corporate demands on capital markets are expected to decline
during August and September from their relatively active July pace.
The upsurge in large industrial bond offerings evident in July has sub-
sided, and although the forward calendar of utility bonds promises to
remain sizable, underwriters expect a smaller volume of industrials to
persist through the rest of the summer. Some of this reduction in
volume undoubtedly reflects temporary deferrals of long-term financing
in anticipation of yield declines ahead. But some softening of total
business demands also appears to be developing--in short-term markets
as well as long--perhaps partly in reflection of the expected topping
out in business investment.

I 5
Business loan growth at banks has continued quite moderate
in recent weeks even when allowance is made for outright sales of bank
loan assets, and recent declines of commercial paper rates suggest some
lessening of pressures in that market as well, despite the sizable
continuing expansion of bank sponsored paper. While moderation in
business loan growth and easing of commercial paper rates may, of course,
simply reflect shifts in the supply of funds from banks to the money
and securities markets, both developments are also consistent with a
moderation of business credit demands.
Security financing by State and local governments is also
projected to decline in August and September as interest rate ceilings
and high borrowing costs continue to force cancellations and postpone-
ments of new issues. If, as the debate on tax reform proceeds, the
ultimate treatment of interest on municipal bonds promises to be less
drastic than that proposed by the Ways and Means Committee, municipal
yields would decline further from recent sharply higher levels. In
these circumstances, some expansion in the volume of new municipal bond
offerings beyond staff estimates could be expected.
The Board staff estimates that the U. S. Treasury may have
to raise around $2.0 billion of new money for payment in late August,
assuming no temporary borrowing at the Federal Reserve during early
September when the cash balance will be seasonably low. Around mid-
September the Treasury is expected to announce plans for refunding the
$6.4 billion of marketable Federal debt maturing on October 1 ($5.7
billion of which is publicly-held). Large net cash demands by housing

I- 6
agencies will be an additional factor in the market during this period;
to provide support for the mortgage market over the rest of the third
quarter, combined net cash borrowing by the Federal Home Loan Banks and
the FNMA is projected at more than $1.5 billion.
Outlook for credit supply and interest rates
Bank deposits are likely to remain under downward pressure
in the period ahead, given existing Regulation Q ceilings and assuming
no large general decline in market rates. The percentage rate of
attrition on time CD's will probably continue at close to the recent
advanced pace but the dollar size of such run-off should be smaller
since the volume of CD maturities in August and September appears to
be substantially less than in earlier months. For time deposits other
than CD's, only modest net recovery is likely following the large run-
off in July. And in current market circumstances, demand deposits are
not likely to be a significant source of additional bank funds either.
As deposit flows continue constrained, banks will undoubtedly make
further reductions in the volume of new real estate loans and take
further steps to reduce holdings of municipal securities. In addition,
they are likely to continue to seek funds from non-deposit sources and
to keep a tight rein on business loans.
At non-bank thrift institutions, the outlook is for seasonal
moderation of the severe pressures on savings flows evident in July.
With relatively high market yields persisting, however, net growth of
savings accounts should remain at a substantially reduced rate on a

I- 7
seasonally adjusted basis, suggesting further cut-backs of commitments
on new mortgage loans.
Continuing small savings flows to depositary-type financial
intermediaries will, of course, have their counterpart in the mainten-
ance of sizable flows of funds from individuals and businesses directly
into high yielding market securities--chiefly short-term. At the same
time, with market expectations of near-term rate declines recently
showing signs of revival, institutional lenders that made temporary
investments in short-term securities during the earlier summar period
of rising interest rates, may begin shifting to longer-term markets.
Given changing market expectations and the prospect for some net modera-
tion of credit demands, some further decline of interest rates from
their recent highs could develop over the next few weeks, particularly
in long-term markets.

I- 8
Balance of payments outlook. The published early estimate
of net exports of goods and services in the second quarter is $2
billion (annual rate), but it now appears that the true figure may
be only half of that. June merchandise exports were unexpectedly low.
They were still well above a "normal" range, but not enough to make
up, to the extent that had been expected, for first-quarter losses
due to the long dock strike. Net exports of goods and services in
the second half of 1969 should be somewhat higher than in the first
half, but the improvement may be quite small unless the post-strike
catch-up in merchandise trade proves to have been less complete by
midyear for exports than it probably was for imports.
External demand factors continue to suggest that U.S. mer-
chandise exports, which rose 9.5 per cent from 1967 to 1968, ought to
be advancing rapidly this year again. Pressures on resources in several
continental European countries are now comparable in intensity to
those experienced in the last two boom periods, 1964-65 and 1960-61.
The rate of increase in U.S. exports actually recorded for the first
half of 1969 in comparison with the first half of 1968 was only 5
per cent, but allowance for estimated permanent losses because of the
dock strike raises this figure to 8 per cent. The present projection
for the full year is for a 7 per cent rise over 1968, unadjusted for
this year's strike losses, or 8-1/2 per cent adjusted.
While for cyclical reasons exports are fairly strong this
year, as they were in 1960, the international competitive position of

I -9
the United States has been deteriorating in recent years--as it had
also in the later 1950's. Nevertheless, in the next twelve months
the balance of forces seems to favor some net improvement in the U.S.
current account. The expected easing of U.S. domestic demand pressures
later this year and especially in 1970 should help the U.S. balance
of payments by holding down imports--though we foresee no such sharp
reduction in imports as occurred in 1960-61.
The short-run outlook for long-term capital flows remains
discouraging. Foreign purchases on the U.S. stock market and
foreign demand for new security issues by U.S. corporations have
both shrunk sharply in recent months. Should the conditions responsible
for these developments continue in the months ahead--especially a
relatively weak U.S. stock market and high interest rates in the
Euro-dollar market--it is likely that worsening of the long-term
capital account would outweigh any early gain in the current account.
In the realm of short-term capital movements, the biggest
questions for the future now relate, and will continue to relate, to
the course of Euro-dollar borrowing by U.S. banks and to the relative
shares of U.S.-nonbank and foreign supplies to the Euro-dollar market.
We may assume that, as suggested in the discussion of the domestic
credit outlook, U.S. banks will still be seeking to increase their
outstanding Euro-dollar borrowings in coming months, even if the
proposed reserve requirements under Regulation M add to their costs.
But Euro-dollar interest rates have eased off from their peaks, and
rates in European national markets have been rising. Supplies of

I -10
foreign bank and nonbank funds to the Euro-dollar market may
therefore tend to diminish. For these reasons the expected change
in the over-all official settlements balance from large surplus to or
toward deficit--which would be the consequence of any sharp drop in
the hitherto very large flow of foreign funds through the Euro-dollar
market to the United States--may be not far ahead.
Meanwhile further large deficits on the liquidity basis are
to be expected. As in the second quarter--when substantial amounts of
U.S.-owned funds moved into German marks in May and, it seems, into
Euro-dollars in June--the liquidity deficit could continue to run a
good deal larger than underlying trends in the current and long-term
capital accounts would make it. An important factor will be the
reaction of U.S. corporations to the increased difficulty of borrowing
abroad. If they draw down their liquid Euro-dollar holdings to finance
direct investments, the liquidity deficit would to that extent be
improved. However, they may instead use domestic funds to the full
extent allowed by the ample leeway available to many of them under the
OFDI regulations.

THE ECONOMIC PICTURE IN DETAIL
Domestic Nonfinancial Scene
Gross national product. Despite continued strength in
employment and income, there are increasing signs that the expansion
is losing momentum. GNP in the third quarter is now expected to rise
by about $15.5 billion, only modestly less than the $16.4 billion
increase now officially estimated for the second quarter./ But, as in
the past quarter, higher prices are expected to account for much of the
increase in total expenditures, and the rate of growth of real GNP is
likely to edge down to under 2 per cent.
By the fourth quarter, plant and equipment spending--the
major factor sustaining growth this year--is expected to begin to
flatten out. With construction activity and expenditures edging off
and Federal spending resuming its downward movement, expansion in GNP
is likely to slow markedly. A further substantial slowing of GNP
growth is expected in the first half of 1970.
These projections assume extension of the tax surcharge at
the 10 per cent rate through year-end and at 5 per cent through mid-1970;
the elimination of the investment tax credit; the continued restriction
of Federal budget outlays for fiscal 1970 to the $192.9 billion level;
and the continuation of a generally restrictive monetary policy for some
1/ The tables following this section incorporate the recently revised
Commerce GNP figures and an attachment presents the revised figures
back to 1966.

II -2
months ahead. If the surcharge is dropped entirely on January 1, it
is estimated that disposable income in the first quarter would rise by
an additional $4.5 billion, and consumption by about $3.5 billion.
Corporate retained earnings would also be boosted significantly, though
the effects on business spending are problematical.
GNP growth this quarter will likely be supported by a somewhat
larger rise in consumption expenditures. Retail sales so far this year
have shown a decided lack of buoyancy. But, a more rapid growth in
disposable income--the result of the Federal pay raise, which is esti-
mated to add $2.8 billion to wages and salaries, and also of the comple-
tion of payments on 1968 income tax obligations--should boost expenditures
somewhat, despite some increase in the saving rate. The impact is
expected largely in nondurables, which should rebound after an unusually
small second quarter increase. Service expenditures are expected to
continue up at an almost undimished pace,but purchases of durable goods
are expected to edge off, with domestic auto sales declining to an 8.35
million rate.
Other than the anticipated pick-up in consumer expenditures,
most major demand sectors are likely to be showing less ebullience in
the current quarter. Inventory investment, which was a major factor in
raising GNP growth in the second quarter, is expected to continue at
about the same relatively high rate as in the current period.
Our projection of business fixed investment expenditures
shows a distinctly slower rate of growth beginning in the third quarter,

II -3
and an actual reduction after year-end. The projections for the balance
of this year are still based upon the April-May Commerce-SEC survey, but
later information, including the results of the special survey conducted
by the Reserve Banks, newspaper reports and early and incomplete returns
from other surveys, suggests that a change in business expectations may
be underway which could result in a slower growth in business investment
in the last half of this year than had been anticipated earlier.
Residential construction outlays, according to revised
figures, declined by almost $1 billion last quarter, and these expendi-
tures are now expected to continue down a little faster than previously
estimated because of the increasing difficulty of obtaining construction
funds and high costs of mortgage money. In the fourth quarter of this
year, starts are expected to be down to an annual rate of 1.35 million
and expenditures almost $3 billion below the level in the first quarter.
Federal purchases, apart from the pay raise, are also
expected to continue to edge down this quarter. The impact of curtailed
Federal spending, particularly for defense, has already been evident in
a dip in new orders for durable goods in both May and June. No increase
at all is expected in Federal non-defense expenditures. Moreover, the
advance in State and local spending is expected to moderate, reflecting
the increasing difficulty of obtaining financing.
With the decline in Federal purchases likely to resume in
the fourth quarter and with most other major demand sectors showing
less ebullience, final demands are expected to ease significantly. In

II -4
such a situation, incentives for business inventory accumulation are
likely to weaken, but this may be offset to some extent temporarily by
involuntary accumulation. As a result, GNP growth in the fourth
quarter is expected to dip to about $11 billion, and real GNP may
increase by no more than about one per cent.
A further substantial cut in GNP growth is anticipated in
the first half of 1970. Final demands are expected to slow further as
expenditures for business fixed investment begin to decline under the
pressure of reduced sales and profits. With employment and wage and
salary growth dampened by reduced activity, only a modest increase in
consumer spending is anticipated despite the assumed reduction in the
surcharge to 5 per cent. With final sales of goods weakening, business-
men are likely to cut their rates of inventory accumulation, reducing
GNP growth to a projected $8 billion in the first quarter and $6 billion
in the second; in real terms, GNP growth would come to a halt or turn
slightly negative. A significant easing in demands for labor, industrial
capacity and materials should be evident by early next year, and prices
as reflected in the GNP deflator are projected to moderate to about a
three per cent rate of increase in the second quarter.

Industrial production. In July, industrial production is
estimated to have risen about one point further to 175 per cent of the
1957-59 average--0.5 per cent, or slightly more, above the preliminary
June figure and 5.5 per cent above a year earlier.
Auto assemblies in July, after allowance for the earlier
model changeover, rose to an annual rate of 9.1 million units as output
met projected schedules. Production schedules for August and September
are set at the July rate. For the third quarter as a whole, auto
output is scheduled at about the level of a year earlier, but the monthly
pattern in this model changeover period differs sharply from last year.
Among other consumer goods, output of furniture and most appliances was
apparently maintained at advanced levels and production of television
sets remained at the reduced May-June rate. The July employment data
indicate a further substantial rise in output of most business equipment
lines while production of defense equipment recovered from the strike-
reduced June level. Output of steel and most other industrial materials
is estimated to have increased further, with a decline in production of
crude oil offset by a recovery in coal output which had been sharply
curtailed in June in observance of the death of John L. Lewis.
The expansion in output of materials in the first half of
this year has brought this sector to an advanced level relative to
indicated materials consumption. Further, the business equipment com-
ponent of industrial products is higher relative to output of consumer
goods-than ever before except in late 1966. Meanwhile, output of
consumer goods since last fall has been running higher than usual

relative to deflated final sales of these goods. Although changes in
these relationships partly reflect statistical considerations, the
differences appear to be large and persistent enough to indicate growing
imbalances in the industrial sector of the economy.
Capacity utilization. The manufacturing capacity utilization
rate edged up to 84.6 per cent in the second quarter from 84.5 per cent
in the first. The June rate is estimated at 84.7 per cent and July is
expected to be slightly higher.
The stability of the operating rate in recent quarters has
in part reflected offsetting trends. Utilization rates in some materials
producing industries have been rising since last fall. Operating rates
are now high in production of paper and nonferrous metals products and
are above normal in iron and steel. This has been offset by reduced

Retail sales. Weekly figures suggest that July retail sales
were little changed from June. Sales for both May and June have been
revised upward, but the absence of expansive strength in consumer
demand for goods is indicated by the fact that the revised June level
is about the same as last February.
In July, a large decline in sales of durable goods stores
was about offset by an increase (estimated at more than 1 per cent) in
sales of nondurable goods stores. In real terms, July was probably the
third consecutive month with sales below a year earlier.

Sales of new domestic autos were at a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of 8.1 million units for the month of July, down 10 per
cent from June and also from a year earlier when sales set a record
for July. For the year to date, sales are now slightly behind 1968.
The total 5.03 million units compared with 5.08 million in the first

II -10
seven months of last year. Stocks of new autos on July 20 amounted to
1.67 million units, 2 per cent below a year earlier.
Consumer credit. Consumer credit growth stepped up consider-
ably during the spring months, but the second quarter increase was still
smaller than the gains registered in the final two quarters of 1968.
The second quarter rise in instalment credit outstanding amounted to
$9.6 billion (seasonally adjusted annual rate) compared with $8.3 billion
in the first quarter of 1969 and an average slightly above $10 billion
in the second half of last year.
Extensions and repayments of instalment credit both increased
substantially. Extensions rose $3.7 billion to a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of $104.4 billion, after little change in the first quarter,
and repayments advanced by $2.5 billion, compared with a $2.2 billion
increase in the first quarter.
As credit use expanded during a period when retail sales had
slackened, credit purchases rose to a record proportion of retail sales
of autos and other consumer goods in recent months. During the second
quarter, the average monthly dollar volume of instalment credit exten-
sions for these goods reached 41.3 per cent of combined retail sales of
autos and GAF merchandise. Auto credit extensions, relative to retail
sales of automotive group stores, virtually equaled the temporary peak
of 50 per cent reached in late 1964; extensions of instalment credit for
purchases of other consumer goods exceeded 35 per cent of retail GAF
sales for the first time on record.

Leading indicators. The Census composite leading indicator
increased slightly in June, returning to the April peak level, according
to preliminary calculations. The increase occurred as a result of rises
in nonagricultural job placements, industrial materials prices, and the
ratio of price to unit labor cost; there was also a slight increase in
new private housing permits, which remained at a reduced level. The
manufacturing workweek was unchanged, and durable orders, plant and
equipment contracts and orders, and stock prices were down. Net busi-
ness formation, inventory change, and change in consumer instalment debt
were not available for June and profits were not available for the
second quarter.

Over the past half year, the leading composite has been
increasing at a rate slower than the rapid pace of the second half of
1968 and about the same as in the first half of 1968. Postwar peaks
in the economy, including those at the beginning of the "mini-recessions"
of 1951 and 1967 as well as of the four recessions, were all preceded
either by four or more months of sustained decline in this composite or
by longer periods of hesitation--close to two years of little change in
the case of the 1957-58 downturn.
The subgroups and the individual leading indicators, which
are not adjusted for trend and therefore have longer leads than the
trend-adjusted leading composite, currently suggest general hesitation
or lack of strength, though still no clear signal of a downturn. Of
the leading indicator subgroups (not shown in the table here), only the
employment composite rose in June, by a small amount; it is well below
its most recent peak last July.
Manufacturers' orders and shipments. New orders for durable
goods dropped 3.5 per cent in June, following May's 3.1 per cent decline.

II -13
The entire June decline was in the defense industries, with other
changes small and offsetting. The decline in defense new orders was
associated with a $1.1 billion cut in unfilled orders at those indus-
tries, partly accounted for by cancellation of the Manned Orbiting
Laboratory. Durable shipments rose in total and in most groups, except-
ing aerospace. Nondurable shipments and orders repeated their May
increase.

Home goods and apparel 5.8 0.9
Consumer staples -2.9 2.5
For the second quarter as a whole, the value of durable
goods orders showed no change, as the sharp drop in defense industry
orders was offset by increases associated with capital spending. The
continuing strength in machinery and equipment was apparently not just
a result of April's heavy anticipatory ordering, for May and June orders
in this category--although well below April--were nevertheless above the
already high first-quarter average.

II -14
Not too much significance should be attached to the second-
quarter increase in nondurables, which is similar to movements in the
seasonally adjusted series last year. The rise reflects partly the
erratic movements in consumer staples; demand for other manufactured
consumer goods was not strong in the second quarter.
Inventories. Reflecting a sharp rise in book values in
April and May, the Commerce Department's preliminary GNP estimates
showed inventory accumulation increasing from a $6.6 billion to a $9.5
billion annual rate between the first and second quarter. However,
preliminary statistics for June indicate that the book value of manu-
facturers' inventories failed to rise in the last month of the quarter.
Unless data on trade inventories (available next week) show a very fast
rise for June, it seems probable that the GNP inventory figure for the
second quarter will be revised down somewhat. The outlook for trade
inventories in June is uncertain; there is evidence of little further
change in auto dealers' inventories, but retail sales of other consumer
goods appear to have been weak and manufacturers' shipments were strong.

The June rise in manufacturers' shipments, with inventories
unchanged, lowered their inventory-sales ratios. However, with the
billion-dollar drop in durable unfilled orders resulting from the cut
in the defense industry backlog, the durable inventory-backlog ratio
rose further. This ratio has been rising at a rate comparable to that
of late 1966 and is now considerably higher than it was then, suggesting
the possibility of a slowdown from the recent rapid rate of inventory
growth at durable manufacturers.
Inventory-sales ratios were reduced at the trade level in
May; there was a sharp drop at durable retailers, reflecting the reduc-
tion in auto inventories, but the retail nondurable ratio rose. Recent
levels and changes in the trade ratios suggest less imbalance as of the
end of May than there was in late 1966, with future developments
dependent largely on the strength of consumer demand.
Construction and real estate. Outlays for new construction
put in place, which were revised upward somewhat for June to virtually
the peak reached early this year, changed very little in July. However,
residential construction expenditures were revised downward by 2 per
cent for recent months, and they dipped further in July, reflecting the
general downtrend in housing starts since the January peak. Outlays
for nonresidential structures rose slightly, but remained below their
early-year peak. Public construction dipped from a record high in June.
As in other recent months, more than half the year-to-year
increase in current dollar outlays for total construction represented
higher costs as measured by the Census Bureau.

The further decline in seasonally adjusted private housing
starts in June amounted to 4 per cent, to an annual rate of 1.45 million
units. Even so, the average for the second quarter as a whole was
little changed from the relatively advanced rate for the year 1968--
1.51 million. In the second quarter of 1966, by contrast, the starts
rate had already dropped more than a tenth below the 1965 total of 1.47
million units.
A striking feature of the comparatively high level of starts
so far this year has been the relative strength in multifamily units.
While such starts have also declined since January, in the first half
as a whole they were three-fifths higher than in the same period of
1966, as shown in the table. Single-family starts in the first half
year averaged about the same as in the corresponding half of 1966;
consequently, multifamily starts accounted for all of the total increase
over this period. An important stimulus to the record multifamily

II -17
performance this year has been the accumulated demand for housing units
of all types. In response to this stimulus, multifamily builders thus
far have shown a willingness and ability to compete aggressively for
funds from outside as well as within the mortgage market.

Labor market. Labor demand continued strong in July. About
160,000 workers were added to nonfarm payrolls and the workweek continued
at the high June average. Despite the sizable gains of recent months,
employment growth has been at a slower pace than in the first quarter,
and also smaller than growth of the labor force. The unemployment rate
edged up in July by two-tenths of a point, to 3.6 per cent.

II -18
Increased unemployment in the second quarter occurred mainly
among women, reflecting greater difficulty of finding jobs when enter-
ing the labor force. In July, however, the unemployment rise occurred
largely among men and, in part, reflected layoffs resulting from can-
cellations and the stretching out of some space and defense contracts.
These layoffs have resulted in a slow but steady rise in initial claims
for unemployment insurance, and in the last half of July, the level of
insured unemployment was higher than a year earlier for the first time
in sixteen months.

All major sectors except construction and services reported
employment increases in July, but the over-all increase was smaller
than the average monthly rise in the second quarter, which in turn had
shown smaller increases than the first quarter. The slowing of employ-
ment growth has been concentrated in nonmanufacturing activities,
primarily in services, which--exclusive of finance--have not shown an
appreciable increase since March. Manufacturing employment increased
by 65,000 in July (adjusted for returns of strikers during the month);

II -19
the largest increase occurred in the electrical equipment industries,
and there were modest gains in most other manufacturing industries.

Average hourly earnings in July advanced to $3.03 in nonfarm
industries, an increase of 6.3 per cent from a year earlier. As has
been the case for the last several months, the rise was at a slightly
slower rate than in 1968.
In June, total wage and salary payments rose by $4 billion,
reflecting increases in employment and pay rates in all major industry
groups. Despite the relatively strong advance, the growth rate of
total wage and salary payments slowed further in the second quarter.
However, the general pay raise for Federal military and civilian
employees boosted income sharply in July.

Industrial relations. Major collective bargaining settlements
affecting 1.4 million workers during the first half of 1969 provided
median first-year wage increases of nearly 7-1/2 per cent, slightly
higher than the median rise for 1968 as a whole. Large increases were
negotiated in the shipping, airline, and construction industries. Con-
struction settlements, covering more than 150,000 workers, provided
median first-year wage increases of 15.2 per cent.

Because of the very large settlements in construction and
shipping, there was a substantial gap between the first-year wage
increases in manufacturing (6.6 per cent) and nonmanufacturing (10.1
per cent). If consumer prices continue to increase sharply, the unions
in the manufacturing industries may be expected to demand considerably
larger wage increases when contracts are reopened later this year and
next.

II -21
Collective bargaining will continue at a relatively slow
pace in the last half of 1969, with 1.4 million workers in the apparel,
ship building, construction, and electrical equipment industries rene-
gotiating contracts. But during this period, about 3.2 million workers
will receive deferred wage increases--averaging about 4 per cent--
provided by contracts negotiated in 1968 or earlier years.
Wholesale prices. According to preliminary BLS estimates,
wholesale prices rose only 0.1 per cent from mid-June to mid-July, the
smallest monthly increase this year. Average prices of industrial
commodities were up 0.2 per cent, but farm and food prices, which had
accounted for most of the recent monthly increases in the WPI, were
unchanged, and sensitive material prices declined.

structural metal products were all higher, as were those for machinery
and equipment, rubber and rubber products, textile products, and apparel.
Lumber and wood products declined for the fourth consecutive month,
holding down the advance in the industrial average. Prices of farm
products decreased 0.7 per cent in July mainly as a result of increased
supplies of cattle, grains, and fresh fruits and vegetables, but pro-
cessed foods were up.

Since mid-July, additional price increases have been announced
for a number of industrial commodities, the most important being U.S.
Steel's average increase of 4.8 per cent for about one-third of its
products and the increase of 2 cents a pound for copper by the three
largest domestic producers. Most steel producers have followed U.S.
Steel's lead, and the price increases will affect about one-half of
industry shipments. It might be noted that the price increase originally
announced for galvanized sheets was reduced by U.S. Steel to conform to
the new level set by most competitors. Most of these price increases

II -23
are effective in early August, with new prices of tinplate effective
later in the year. If these higher prices remain firm--as is now
expected--price increases in steel-using consumer goods industries are
likely to result. Of uncertain significance now is the fact that
General Motors has notified U.S. Steel not to ship steel at the new
prices until General Motors has reevaluated the competitive steel price
situation.
The increase in copper prices to 48-48-1/2 cents a pound--an
all-time high--has already resulted in the seventh increase this year
in the prices of brass mill products.
Further declines were registered in prices of livestock
during the latter part of July as deliveries of livestock increased,
and wholesale meat prices were also down. Prices of livestock are
likely to decrease further in the next few months if expectations of
increased beef supplies are realized.
Consumer prices. Consumer prices rose at an annual rate of
7.6 per cent in June, sharply above the 3.8 per cent of May and somewhat
more than the average increase in the first half of this year. June
prices were 5.5 per cent above a year earlier with exceptionally large
increases over this period in costs of services, apparel, and foods.
Food prices accounted for one-half of the rise in consumer
prices in June. The advance of 8.7 per cent in meat prices from March
to June was one of the largest in the post-war period. A further sizable
gain at retail is likely in July, although beef prices at wholesale have

II -24
declined. For the third quarter as a whole, beef marketings are
expected to improve substantially and the rise in retail food prices
should taper off. The outlook for adequate supplies of other foods is
favorable.
Costs of consumer services rose more slowly in June than
earlier, but still accounted for about one-fourth of the advance in the
index. Costs of mortgage interest and home maintenance and repair
services continued to rise appreciably as did public transportation
fares. Higher physicians' fees contributed most to the rise in cost
of medical care.
Apparel prices continued to increase in June, but at a slower
rate than earlier. Fall apparel prices are expected to reflect higher
labor costs in manufacturing. Durable goods, including new autos, are
likely to advance further, reflecting higher costs of both labor and
materials.

Farm income and prices. A sharp upswing in prices of live-
stock products during the second quarter boosted gross farm income to
a new high and raised farmers' net realized income to $16.3 billion
(seasonally adjusted annual rate), 9 per cent above the first quarter,
as shown in the table. Most of the gain accrued to livestock producers
who benefitted from slackened marketings of meat animals during the
second quarter in the face of burgeoning consumer demand for meats.
Gross receipts of crop producers were also a little more favorable than
a year earlier with a larger volume of marketings and somewhat larger
Government payments compensating for lower crop prices.
The uptrend in costs of production items accelerated in the
second quarter largely because of a 21 per cent increase in feeder
livestock prices. Prices of feed were unchanged and prices of nonfarm
inputs rose 1 per cent. Wage rates, interest, and taxes also rose.
The volume of inputs was generally larger than last year and total
outlays for expenses were up 8 per cent on average.
During the second half, farmers' gross returns may advance
further but net realized income may be held in check by advancing
production expenses. If July 1 crop production prospects are realized,
continued downward pressure on crop prices is likely with prices of
grains and oilseeds averaging near price support loan levels as in 1968.
Livestock prices are likely to move down from present high levels but
should average above a year earlier. If the midyear surveys of feed
cattle and hog numbers are reasonably accurate, beef supplies will
average above a year earlier in the second half but pork will drop below

II -26
in the fourth quarter. Larger broiler and egg production and smaller
milk production are anticipated. Milk is in near balance with demand,
and shortages are not likely.

THE ECONOMIC PICTURE IN DETAIL
Domestic Financial Situation
Bank Credit. Although commercial bank credit is estimated
to have risen substantially in July, most of the advance is attri-
butable to temporary factors. There was a temporary increase in
bank holdings of Treasury bills associated with bank underwriting
of the tax bill financing around mid-month and a sharp rise in one-
day broker-dealer loans resulting from large System matched sale-
purchase transactions near month-end. The continued limited avail-
ability of bank credit to private sectors was reflected in accelerated
bank liquidation of other securities and a moderate rate of loan
expansion (exclusive of the effect of the matched sale-purchase
transactions) that was well below that of earlier in the year.

Bank holdings of securities rose somewhat in July, following
a decline of about $5.7 billion over the first half of the year. This
increase reflected bank underwriting of nearly all of a $3.5 billion
Treasury financing, payable 100 per cent in credits to tax and loan
accounts. Prior to the financing, the run-off of Treasury bills in
early July had been sizable. Moreover, during July banks liquidated
a very large amount of municipals--both short- and long-term--as
well as some participation certificates and agency issues.
Bank loans--excluding the $1.2 billion increase in broker-
dealer loans resulting from System matched sale-purchase transactions
at month-end--rose only moderately in July, following a slight decline
in June. Even if loans sold outright to bank holding companies and
affiliates are included for June and July, the average increase in
loans was less than half the average monthly increase during the first
five months of the year.
Much of the recent slowdown in loan expansion reflects a
marked reduction in the rate of growth of business loans. After
remaining unchanged in June, business loans rose by only $400 million
in July, as compared to an average monthly increase of more than $1.3
billion during the first five month's of the year. Even inclusion of
loans sold outright to holding companies and affiliates would raise
the average monthly increase in June and July to only about 1/2 that
earlier in the year. The increase in the prime rate early in June,
as well as further deterioration in bank liquidity, probably have
been important factors in the moderation of business loan expansion.
Among weekly reporting banks, the recent weakness in business loans
was somewhat more evident at banks outside New York and was fairly
widespread among industry categories.

III -3
Growth in other loans has also slackened in recent months.
The rate of expansion of real estate loans, which began to slow in
May, moderated even further in June and July. Similarly, the rate
of increase in consumer loans during the past few months has slowed
even further from the reduced pace earlier in the year.
The erosion of bank liquidity that has been taking place
since late last year continued in June and July. Despite the $1.7
billion increase in Treasury bill holdings in the week of July 23--
mostly representing temporary financing--average liquidity positions
at large banks for the first four weeks in July had fallen well
below the lowest levels reached in 1966.

Bank sources of funds. Total member bank deposits fell
sharply further in July, declining by more than $5 billion. This
reduction reflected mainly outflows of time and savings deposits,
particularly CD's, although U.S. Government deposits also declined
substantially. Banks with foreign branches borrowed further in the
Euro-dollar market, with liabilities to foreign branches rising by
an additional $1 billion during July. Moreover, banks continued to
raise funds from other nondeposit sources. During the first four
weeks in July, as indicated by the chart on the following page, such
additional borrowings by the head offices of banks and their
subsidiaries, affiliates, and holding companies rose by almost $1.2
billion as compared to the $660 million raised by these means in
June.

As most money market rates advanced further, outstanding CD's
declined by nearly $1.6 billion during the first four weeks in July,
and New York and Chicago banks lost another $20 million in the week
ending July 30. This brought the reduction since early December to
nearly $10.6 billion or about 45 per cent of the amount of CD's
outstanding at that time. The run-off of CD's in both June and
July was substantially larger than earlier in the year both in terms
of dollar volume and as a per cent of maturing issues. Moreover,
most of this increased attrition occurred at banks outside of New
York and Chicago.
Banks also experienced sizable outflows of consumer-type
time and savings deposits during the first four weeks in July,
following interest crediting at midyear. At large banks, savings
deposits fell further, after having declined substantially earlier
in the year. Consumer time deposits, which began to decline in June,
decreased even more rapidly in July. Moreover, time and savings
deposits at country banks began to fall in July--for the first time
this year--following substantially reduced growth during the second
quarter.
The money stock, measured on a daily average basis, rose
at about a 3 per cent annual rate in July, slightly more rapid than
the pace of the first half. U.S. Government deposits fell by an
additional $1.5 billion in July, more than offsetting the slight
rise in private demand balances,

III -7
Nonbank depositary intermediaries. Savings outflows from
thrift institutions during the recent reinvestment period were
sizeable, as had been expected. Outflows from savings and loan
associations were somewhat larger than last year but, to the extent
that comparison is possible, appear to have been considerably less
than in 1966. The New York City mutual savings banks experienced
very large outflows--much larger than in 1966, when they were able
to limit withdrawals by increasing their offering rates. The most
noteworthy feature of the recent period appears to have been
persistence of withdrawal activity even after the reinvestment
period. At least through the third week of July, net inflows
had not yet materialized for New York mutual savings banks, and S&L out-
flows during the latter half of July amounted to a rather sizeable
$300 million.

The reinvestment period was generally in accord with forecasts,
and the institutions apparently had prepared to meet withdrawals in the
magnitude realized. Savings banks reportedly did not rely heavily on
their lines of credit, but instead were said to have sold part of their
corporate bond portfolio to supplement usual liquid sources. Savings
and loan associations relied heavily on FHLB advances, which increased
by $680 million during July. FHLB system liquidity was down to $700
million at one point during the month, but has since been bolstered
by the $500 million of new money received from the recent financing.
The FHLBB has again raised rates on advances, to the 6.75% -to -7%
range,
S&L savings growth during the past two months is estimated
to have slowed even further from the reduced second quarter pace.
Estimates for the savings banks' experience in July are not yet
available.

Mortgage market. Although net outflows from the thrift
institutions apparently persisted beyond the July reinvestment period,
trade expectations in recent weeks as indicated by FNMA field reports
were for conditions in the home mortgage market to tighten little
further--if not to ease moderately--over the near term. Reflecting
partly these expectations but mainly the continued exceptionally
large volume of FNMA bids accepted, the average secondary market
yield for 6-month commitments in FNMA's August 4 auction averaged
8.28 per cent--19 basis points below the high reached early last
month.

eliminates the possibility of capital gains in the sale of

three years by auction participants.
During June, when the prime rate increase was followed by
growing apprehension about the then-approaching reinvestment period,
average returns in both the primary and secondary market for new-home
mortgages rose sharply to new highs at or above usury ceilings pre-
vailing in nearly half of the States. Even so, investment in home
mortgages continued relatively unattractive compared with yields
on new issues of high grade corporate bonds. Moreover, returns on
home loans remained well below nominal rates on multifamily and non-
residential mortgages, which are usually not limited by usury ceilings,
involve lower net servicing costs, and may carry "equity kickers" as
well.

associated with a change of 12 to 14 basis points in yield.
Gross yield spread is average mortgage return, before
deducting service fees, minus average yield on new issues of

Reflecting continuing pressures throughout the capital
market, insured S&L's and New York State mutual savings banks cut
back their total new mortgage commitments during June, after
seasonal adjustment. Outstanding commitments of these institutions,
while still quite high, edged down for the second consecutive
month. The outstanding commitments represented about a 4-1/2 month
volume of S&L mortgage acquisitions and a 9-month volume of savings
bank lending, based on the rate of loans disbursed by these institu-
tions in June.

III -12
So far this year, insured S&L's have provided much stronger
support to the mortgage market than they did in 1966. At the end
of June this year, their commitment backlogs were slightly larger
than at the end of last December. By mid-1966, in contrast,
outstanding mortgage commitments of the S&L's were a fifth below the
levels of the preceding December.
Corporate and municipal bond markets. Yields on the latest
corporate new bond issues have stabilized, at least temporarily,
after increasing in the last half of July, with Aaa-rated equivalent
yields of 7-5/8 -7-3/4 per cent receiving excellent responses from
investors. This increased investor interest reportedly stems, in
part, from individuals shifting funds out of equities and financial
intermediary claims.

In contrast, municipal bond yields over the last two weeks
advanced more than 30 basis points. The immediate cause of the sharp
deterioration seems to be uncertainties associated with the tax
reform proposals as they apply to the treatment of income from tax-
exempt securities. With many individual investors reluctant to
undertake commitments until the tax reform issues are resolved, and
with commercial banks reducing their municipal holdings, new issues
sold slowly even at substantially higher yields. In the last few
days, however, yields declined significantly as the market was
buoyed by committeeelimination from the tax reform bill of the proposal
to tax the municipal interest receipts of corporate holders.
Unsettled municipal market conditions led to an increase in
the pace of bond postponements. But the flotation of several large
issues early in the month--when yields were declining--kept the aggre-
gate volume for July from falling below $1 billion. Assuming continued
sizeable postponements, municipal bond volume for August is estimated
at $700 million and September is expected to show only about a
seasonal increase, to $800 million. Thus, the average monthly volume
for the third quarter would be nearly one-third below the quarter
earlier and only about half as large as in the comparable year- ago
period.

Public offerings of corporate bonds totaled almost $1.4
billion in July, the largest monthly volume in more than a year.
Nearly one-third of this volume was accounted for by straight debt
offerings of industrial firms--issues largely absent during the
first half of the year. The sharp break in stock prices led to
a drop-off in equity offerings, however, so that total corporate
security offerings, at less than $2.4 billion, were slightly
below the second quarter average.

Underwriters report that relatively few large industrial
issues are contemplated within the next two months, reflecting in
part the attempts of borrowers to tap alternative sources of funds
in anticipation of lower long-term rates in the future. Public
bond volume is, therefore, not expected to rise above $1 billion per
month and might be less if stock prices decline further and discourage
offerings of convertible bonds. Total corporate bond and stock
offerings, including private placements, are estimated at $1.9 billion
in August, $400 million below July. After allowance for a seasonal
upturn in September, total corporate security offerings for the
quarter as a whole are estimated to average $2.1 billion--significantly
below the pace during the second quarter.

III -16
Stock market. Stock prices continued to decline sharply
through nearly the end of July before experiencing a presumed technical
rally late last week. At the close of trading on July 29, prices on
the American and New York Stock Exchanges reached new lows for the
year and were 17 to 24 per cent below their recent high levels in
mid-May. With increased indication of some weakening in corporate
earnings over the second quarter, widespread expectations of a coming
business adjustment, and uncertainty as to future capital gains
treatment in proposed tax reform legislation, few issues have escaped
the downward trend. On the average day over the three weeks prior
to July 29, declines outnumbered advances by more than two to one
in the issues traded on the New York Stock Exchange.
By current standards, trading volume has continued at a
relatively moderate pace in recent weeks with no noticeable effect
of the July 7 extension of daily trading sessions by one-half hour.
Fails to deliver by NYSE member firms at the end of June were
reported to be $2.1 billion, the lowest level since these data
became available in April 1968 and substantially below the December
1968 peak of $4.1 billion.

Analysis of preliminary data indicates that margin customers
continued to liquidate holdings during June. Margin credit extended by
NYSE member firms to their customers declined $270 million for the
month, to $5.4 billion, the largest decline since January 1969 and the
second largest in the three and one-half year history of the new
margin credit series. Market value of collateral in margin accounts
fell $3.27 billion (13.6 per cent) to $20.77 billion, reflecting
the combination of withdrawal of securities sold from accounts and
shrinkage in market value of securities held.
As a result of declining collateral values, the equity status
of margin accounts deteriorated during June. At month-end 98.2 per
cent of margin credit was in accounts which were restricted in
withdrawal of either cash or securities, compared with 95.2 of
total margin credit in May. The amount of debt in accounts with less
than 40 per cent net equity, and thus potentially subject to calls
for additional margin or forced liquidation of securities, increased
during June from 17 per cent to 20 per cent of total margin debt.
Although comparable detailed data is unavailable for bank
lending on stock collateral, bank loans to others than brokers and
dealers for purchasing securities declined in June by $30 million to
$2.74 billion. In combination, total reported stock market
credit at the end of June was $8.14 billion, the lowest level since
September 1967 and more than 11 per cent below the $9.1 billion
level of June 1968, when margin requirements were raised to their
current 80 per cent level.

III -19
Corporate profits. Corporate profits before tax, which
had a slight increase in the first quarter of this year, are
estimated to have declined by about the same amount in the second
quarter. Profits in nonmanufacturing industries as a whole seem
likely to have remained at about the first quarter level, but
profits of manufacturing corporations appear to have declined
by at least $1 billion. Since total manufacturing shipments were
slightly larger in the second quarter than in the first, the
decline in profits apparently reflected a drop in profit margins.
The estimate for manufacturing profits is based on published
earnings reports for nearly 800 companies that account for about
two-thirds of total manufacturing profits. Data for these companies
suggest that, on a seasonally unadjusted basis, manufacturing profits
before tax rose only 7 per cent from the first to the second
quarter of 1969 (compared with an increase averaging 15 per cent
in the preceding 5 years) and were only 2 per cent larger in the
second quarter of this year than in the same quarter of last year
(compared with year-to-year increases of 10 to 20 per cent through-
out 1968 and in the first quarter of 1969). Profits of automobile
and of primary iron and steel producers were sharply below their year-
earlier totals but, even with these two groups excluded, earnings
in other manufacturing industries as a whole also showed an unusually
small increase over the second quarter of 1968 and the first
quarter of this year.

Government securities market. Interest rates on longer-term
Government securities edged somewhat higher in the period immediately
following the last Committee meeting as possible terms for the Treasury
August refinancing were being debated. Once the favorable
character of this financing became clear, these yield advances were
reversed. Yields on most Treasury bills have edged lower since the last
meeting, particularly in recent days.

The cumulative effects of continued tight credit
conditions apparently contributed to yield advances during the
earlier part of the period. More recently, however, Congressional
approval of a 6-month extension of the surtax and some strengthening
of expectations for a slowing of business activity ahead have con-
tributed to a considerable improvement in market psychology.

III -21
There was also some easing in dealer financing conditions
in the latter part of July. The effective rate on Federal funds
trading in New York averaged 8.28 per cent in the latter half of
July compared to 9.15 per cent in the first half, and lending
rates to dealers by the major New York banks moved down by nearly
a percentage point on average. Moreover, dealers recently have
reported a better availability of out-of-town RP money--often
at around 7-1/2 per cent--stemming partly from temporarily liquid
funds held by corporations.
In recent weekly and monthly Treasury bill auctions,
interest in the new issues before bidding time appeared to be
relatively unenthusiastic, but usually turned out to be better
than expected--as customers were attracted by the higher rate
levels--resulting in generally narrow spreads between the average
and stop-out rates. Of special note, there has been some further
increase lately in noncompetitive tenders, reflecting an
enlarged interest in bills from stock houses and individuals.
Demand for bills in the secondary market has continued
to be concentrated largely in the shorter maturities, and conse-
quently dealers have often had net short positions in bills due
within 3 months in recent weeks. At the same time, holdings of
longer bills have grown further on average, largely reflecting
additional positioning of tax bills, as commercial banks have
sold more of their awards into the Street following initial
underwriting of the TAB financing that was paid for in mid-July.

In the August refinancing, the Treasury offered a single
18-month note in a rights exchange for the $3.4 billion of August
maturities. The note bears a 7-3/4 per cent coupon and was priced to
yield 7.82 per cent. Books were open for the exchange on August 4-6.
The Treasury decided not to include a pre-refunding of the $5.7 billion
of October 1 maturities, in the hope that borrowing costs might be lower
by that time.
The early market reaction to the refunding appeared quite
favorable, with a good investor interest anticipated, especially from
commercial banks, who generally are heavy buyers of Government debt
in the 18-month area. Most recently, the when-issued bid on the new
note was 100-6/32--compared to the initial price of 99-29/32--which
would reduce the yield to around 7.62 per cent. Recent market
ideas on the size of attrition centered around 5 to 10 per cent.

III -23
Other short-term credit markets. Upward rate pressures
in short-term credit markets lessened somewhat in July following the
sharp upward adjustments of June. Nonetheless, yields in some of
these markets did continue to move higher. For example, finance
paper rates at the end of July were generally 25 to 75 basis points
higher than at the beginning of the month, while short-term Agency
yields rose to to 25 basis points over the month. However, commercial
paper rates eased in the latter half of July and rates on bankers'
acceptances also moved lower on balance in July. More recent informa-
tion available for rates on bankers' acceptances and Agency issues
show some further easing.

In addition to those factors that have affected other markets
as well, the recent tendency toward some slowing or reversal in the
upward movement in short-term credit market rates has reflected the
better supplies of investable funds in these markets in July. For
example, the market has reported considerable investor interest from
corporations that have not been able to employ their cash flows in
the dealer repurchase market because of the reduced volume of dealer
financing requirements. Funds have also been more readily available from
mutual funds and others who have temporarily moved out of equities, as well
as, perhaps, reflecting savings outflows from depositary-type institu-
tions. Seasonal flows associated with the automobile pre-model change-
over period have also added to the current supplies of funds to these
markets.
Data on the changes in commercial and finance paper out-
standing for July will not be available until late August. June data
show a sharp increase from the May pace. However, the data for
directly placed paper, generally representing finance company paper,
includes some $600 million of outstanding paper issued by bank holding
companies not included earlier. Therefore, the increase in this
component of these data for June is not as large as indicated in the
table. The sharp rise in dealer-placed commercial paper in June
should also be interpreted carefully, since market reports toward the
end of June suggested that the greater part of the rise came early in
the month prior to the prime rate increase and that activity later in
the month slackened.

Federal finance: Preliminary budget figures for all of
fiscal 1969 showed an unexpectedly large surplus of $3.1 billion
with receipts running above earlier Administration forecasts and
outlays falling substantially short of official expenditure ceilings.
(A more detailed explanation of the factors contributing to this
surplus is provided in the Appendix.)
The Treasury cash balance at the end of July totaled a
comfortable $5.7 billion. Nevertheless, because August and early
September are a period of seasonal cash deficit, additional net
cash borrowing of around $2.0 billion will be needed for payment in
late August. After mid-September, the quarterly pick-up in income
tax receipts is expected to rebuild the Treasury balance to a month-
end level of more than $9 billion. This should finance most of the
anticipated seasonal deficit for October and early November.
Around mid-September, the Treasury is expected to announce
plans for refinancing the rather sizable volume of Federal debt
maturing on October 1, $5.7 billion of which is held by the public.
This will be the last operation for calendar 1969 in which investors
are offered new coupon issues. There are no debt maturities to be
refunded in the usual November quarterly refinancing period, and
fourth quarter cash financing is expected to be confined exclusively
to tax anticipation bills.

THE ECONOMIC PICTURE IN DETAIL
International Developments
Foreign exchange and money markets. Demand for most major
foreign currencies was generally stronger during July -- providing
some relief from the selling pressures which have persisted for most
of the year. This change in demand for foreign currencies may reflect
the fact that recent credit restraint actions in Europe are beginning
to bite; higher interest rates abroad coupled with some easing of
Euro-dollar rates has moderated, if not stopped for the most part,
the generally widespread movement of funds out of foreign currencies
into Euro-dollars which reached a peak in June.
The market for sterling was generally firm in July -- though
experiencing a little weakness on announcement of the June trade deficit,
which was a little above the sharply reduced May level. The Bank of
England was able to purchase $350 million during June. The French
franc continued under some selling pressure, but the Bank of France
had to sell only $140 million in the market in July, compared with
$330 million in June.
Future developments in Germany continue to be the major
uncertainty overhanging exchange markets. With the Bundesbank taking
further tightening measures, the sustainability of the capital outflow
needed to offset the large German trade surplus becomes more questionable.

IV -2
Revaluation fever flared-up on a small scale in mid-July and the Bundesbank
purchased a moderate amount of dollars at that time. However, for the
month as a whole its market transactions -- both spot and forward --
produced a $125 million decline in reserves.
Conditions in many major national money markets abroad tightened
further in July. The Bank of Canada announced a 1/2 per cent bank rate
increase to 8 per cent on July 16; on July 17 the Bundesbank announced
a 10 per cent increase in reserve requirements against German banks'
deposit liabilities; on July 30 the Belgian National Bank raised its
bank rate by 1 per cent to 7 per cent; and the Netherlands Bank followed
on August 1 with a 1/2 per cent bank rate increase to 6 per cent. The
Swiss money market failed to ease after the passing of the midyear.
The degree of tightness in the German money market has been
such that the banks have not taken advantage on any significant scale
of the Bundesbank's reduced swap contract rate for placement of funds
in the Euro-dollar market; by August 5 the Bundesbank had reduced its
rate for forward DM to a 4 per cent per annum premium, about 1/4 per
cent below the market forward rate.
Tending to moderate movements into Euro-dollars on the part
of foreign banks and nonbanks in general, Euro-dollar interest rates
have declined steadily in all maturities during the past four weeks.
The three-month deposit rate, for example, averaged about 10.3 per
cent in the week ending August 6, compared to an average rate of 11.2 per
cent during the week ending July 9 -- for an average decline in excess

IV -3
of 20 basis points per week. Shorter-dated deposits have eased even
more. The one-month rate averaged a little over 9-1/2 per cent in
the week ending August 6, about 1-3/8 per cent below its average
level in the second week of July; call deposits, recently bid at
about 9 per cent, had been about 2-1/2 percentage points higher in
early July.
U.S. banks' liabilities to their foreign branches continued
to increase during this four-week period of easing Euro-dollar rates,
though at a considerably reduced rate after mid-July. These borrowings
increased by $1 billion between June 25 and July 16, but by only $170
million between July 16 and July 30. Partial data through Monday,
August 4, show some decline since July 30.

U.S. balance of payments. Developments in the first half of
the year, and results now indicated for July, underline the dangers in
relying on a structure of U.S. international transactions such as that
which emerged last year, with large capital inflows rather than a strong
current account. Exports have not yet responded as well as expected to
strong demand pressures abroad, and imports, while not rising strongly,
have not retreated significantly from their recent very high ratio to
GNP. Some liquidation of U.S. corporate equities by foreign investors
occurred in June, and very likely intensified in July, while outflows
of U.S. capital have been rising.
In terms of the liquidity balance, the first-half deficit
reached $5.5 billion (seasonally adjusted, but not an annual rate) and
indications are that the July deficit was $1-1/2 billion or more, after
rough adjustment for adverse seasonal influences in the month. In both
quarters there seem to have been unusually large outflows of private
capital, in large part unrecorded. In addition, there was a sharp
deterioration from the first to the second quarter in a number of
transactions for which data are currently available, or can be estimated,
as shown in the table on the following page.
A prominent feature of the accounts in the first half is the
extraordinary size of the payments that appear in the residual line of
the table. In the first quarter, for which a full set of accounts has
been prepared, that residual contains not only recorded outflows of
private corporate capital, U.S. Government grants and credits, and the

other usual income and service accounts, but also an errors and omissions
item of $1.4 billion. This probably can be viewed in large measure as
unrecorded outflows of U.S. corporate capital which had been brought
back to the United States in the last months of 1968 to meet the require-
ments of the controls. However, in the second quarter this residual
item became even larger, strongly suggesting that there were large out-
flows of private capital, first to move into DM in May and then, after
mid-May, to take advantage of steeply rising Euro-dollar rates.
If major corporations are taking part in this capital outflow
by way of their foreign affiliates the second quarter accounts will show
a large increase in direct investments abroad, compared to a relatively
low amount in the first quarter. However, there is a strong presumption
that high Euro-dollar rates have attracted substantial amounts of U.S.
funds into deposits abroad that are, in effect, then redeposited in the
United States via branch banks abroad, thus avoiding the limitations of
Regulation Q. The very large July liquidity deficit suggests that this
type of outflow was continuing. Funds of this type are not likely to
remain abroad and add to foreign official reserves once interest rate
relationships change, and may therefore be discounted as a potential
threat to U.S. reserves.
Several items shown in the table worsened markedly between
the first and second quarters; outflows of bank-reported claims increased
by over $500 million, foreign purchases of U.S. securities were lower by
about $1 billion, and "special" intergovernmental financing transactions

IV -7
shifted adversely by $400 million. In both quarters Germany made its
usual purchase of medium-term securities under the military offset
arrangement, but in the second quarter this source of receipts was
greatly outweighed by the liquidation of long-term deposits (over-one-
year maturities) by a number of countries, and by the liquidation of
$250 million of Canadian holdings of nonliquid U.S. Treasury issues.
The rise in bank-reported claims in the second quarter contained
several elements; it included about $100 million of outflows for the
account of customers, a comparable amount said to represent advances to
foreign branches that are likely to be reversed fairly soon, and some
outflows to Germany and Canada that might reflect temporary influences.
However, in June the major outflow was to Japan, indicating that some
outstanding commitments were utilized.
More significant is the drop in foreign purchases of U.S.
securities. Investments in U.S. corporate equities had continued,
though on a diminished scale, through May, but in June there was a net
liquidation of over $100 million, which was probably influenced by such
factors as the weakening of the U.S. market, high yields available on
Euro-dollar and other alternative investments, and the relatively good
showing of some other stock markets such as those of Germany and Japan.
Also, U.S. investors have recently increased the rate at which they have
been purchasing foreign equities.
There has also been a major reduction in foreign purchases of
other U.S. securities, excluding Treasury issues. Acquisitions of U.S.

IV -8
Government agency securities by international organizations, typically
to absorb the proceeds of new borrowings in the U.S. market, were halted.
More important, there has been a drop in sales of securities abroad by
U.S. corporations mainly intended to finance their foreign affiliates.
The lack of investor interest, for the reasons mentioned above, has been
the main factor in this drop, though there may also be a reduced demand
on the part of U.S. corporations that have sufficient leeway under the
regulations, or have accumulated proceeds out of earlier borrowings.
According to reports to the OFDI earlier in the year, direct
investors had expected to utilize even larger amounts of foreign-source
funds abroad this year than last year, so that the rise in outflows of
U.S. funds would be less than allowed by their ceilings under the
regulations. Failure to secure these offshore funds would cause some
additional outflow of U.S. funds. Very little is known about corporate
capital transfers in the second quarter. Reports on liquid assets held
abroad by U.S. nonbanks show an outflow of about $140 million in April-
May, including some outflow into DM assets, but major investors may have
moved a much larger amount of funds abroad via their foreign affiliates,
for which there is no current information. It is also possible that
dividends paid by foreign affiliates are being held to a minimum.
The official settlements balance continued to register surpluses
to mid-July, as borrowing by U.S. banks drew funds out of other currencies
at the expense of official reserves abroad. Liabilities to commercial
banks abroad (including foreign branches) rose by $3.2 billion in the
first quarter, and there was a further rise of $4.6 billion in the second
quarter.

Merchandise trade. The trade balance in June (balance of
payments basis) was barely in surplus ($0.4 billion, annual rate) as
exports increased slightly while imports decreased from the record
May amount. For the second quarter, exports and imports were virtually
equal at a $38.5 billion, annual rate. The balance for the entire first
half of 1969 was a deficit of $0.2 billion, annual rate, compared to
small export surpluses in both halves of 1968. Most of the adverse
effect of the December-March dock strike was felt in the first half --
the permanent loss due to the strike has been estimated as perhaps
$500 million in exports ($300 million in agricultural good and $200
million in other types) and $200 million in imports.
In the first half of this year exports were about 1 per cent
less than in the second half of 1968 and imports were 1 per cent larger.
Even if the assumed permanent strike loss was included in the first-
half totals, the change from the preceding half year would be small
for both exports and imports compared with much stronger advances in
both the first and second halves of 1968.
Exports throughout the second quarter were above "normal"
levels but for the entire first half were at an annual rate of only
$34.2 billion (balance of payments basis), slightly less than the
rate of the second half of 1968. A small increase in nonagricultural
exports was offset by a 12 per cent decline in agricultural shipments --
there would be some decline even without the estimated $300 million
permanent strike loss. In spite of the continued economic boom in

Europe, U.S. first half exports to Western Europe were about 4 per cent
less than those of the second half of 1968; at least part of this decline
may be attributed to declining agricultural shipments. Exports to Japan
and Canada increased at rates nearly equal to those of the second half
1968.
Export orders for machinery in the first half of 1969 were
more than 11 per cent greater than orders in the preceding half-year --
a rate of increase about equal to that reached in the second half of 1968.
Machinery exports, however, particularly nonelectric machinery, slowed
in the first half. Chemical exports also weakened.

IV -11
Imports in the second quarter were also well above first
quarter rates and for the first half of 1969 were at a $34.4 billion
annual rate (balance of payments basis), 1 per cent greater than in the
second half of 1968. The import/GNP ratio for the first half, although
slightly lower than the second half 1968 ratio, remained at the high
level reached in 1968 as strong U.S. output and consumption continued
to provide good markets. Imports of nonfood consumer goods (excluding
automobiles) increased by nearly 15 per cent over the second half of
1968. Automotive imports equaled the 1968 second half record amount
as sales of Japanese cars (Toyota and Datsun) in January-June more than
doubled sales in the same period a year ago. Automotive imports from
Canada continued to increase but at a slower rate than experienced during
the past few half-year periods. Machinery imports also continued to
increase, at a rate equal to that of the second half of 1968.
Not all categories of imports increased in the first half of
1969. Imports of foods (particularly coffee) and industrial supplies
(particularly steel) declined. Part of the softening in steel imports
may be attributable to increased European demand for steel and price
increases in the common market and Japan; imports from EEC countries
in the first half are less than the quotas established by last year's
import restriction agreement. However, during the first six months of
the year steel has been imported from Japan at a rate above that set by
its annual quota.

IV -12
Inflationary pressures in other industrial countries. How
intense are current inflationary pressures in industrial countries out-
side the United States? Officials in Canada, Japan and a number of
Continental European countries--particularly Germany, France, the
Netherlands, Belgium and Sweden--refer with increasing frequency to the
"overheating" which their economies are approaching or already are ex-
periencing. Restrictive monetary and fiscal policies adopted by these
countries in recent months have been justified on these grounds. For
some, however, external considerations have reinforced decisions to
pursue restrictive policies.
The two important exceptions to this general picture of in-
flationary pressures are the United Kingdom and Italy, where there are
no immediate tendencies toward overheating.
As reported in the June 18 Greenbook, price increases in most
industrial countries have accelerated since mid-1968. With the exception
of the Netherlands, where a price freeze was introduced in mid-April,
prices have continued to advance in recent months.
A strong surge in private investment and a continued expansion
of foreign demand for exports have fueled the upswing in most of the
countries. Consumer expenditures have advanced more moderately, except
in France. Even in countries where restrictive fiscal measures have not
been adopted, the public sector has not been a major contributing force
to the expansion.

IV -13
Until recently, supply conditions have adjusted comparatively
well to rising demand in most cases, but lately we see some signs that
capacity limitations are inhibiting further rapid expansion of production.
Evidence of growing pressure on resources can be found in data relating
to capacity utilization, order backlogs and the labor market. In several
countries, production capacities are becoming fully stretched and distinct
labor shortages are appearing. Some economies appear to be approaching
or exceeding resource utilization levels attained at the peaks of the
previous booms of the 1960's.
Most of the countries are at a policy crossroads: should they
introduce even stronger anti-inflationary policies and perhaps prema-
turely curb the expansion, or should they allow the upswing to continue
at its current pace and face the risk of excessive inflation? Since
the toleration of inflation in many of these countries is not very high,
there may be a tendency for authorities to choose the first course of
action--to move early in order to prevent what they consider to be
inflationary excesses. In the case of France and some of the smaller
economies, external considerations may lead the authorities to intensify
their efforts to curb the economic expansion.
The United Kingdom and Italy are currently not experiencing
boom conditions, as reflected by supply shortages and, therefore, fall
outside the scope of this discussion. In the United Kingdom, in fact,
real GDP in the first quarter of this year was more than 1 per cent

IV -14
below the previous quarter's level. Moreover, although the index for
total industrial production in the second quarter of this year was
running above the January-March level, it was still below the level of
the fourth quarter of 1968. In Italy, the upswing is gaining momentum,
but the availability of underutilized resources has allowed supply ex-
pansion to accommodate the buoyand demand thus far.
The economic expansion in Germany, now in its third year, has
developed into a vigorous upswing. Strong foreign demand and private
investment outlays have been the main sources supplying the buoyancy.
Most data indicate that resources are now under even greater strain than
they were at the peaks of the 1959-61 and 1963-66 upswings. In contrast
to previous expansions, however, the building and public sectors are
not major contributors to the overheating. Currently, construction
activity does not appear to be excessive, and recent fiscal policy
steps have reduced the contribution of the government to the expansion
of aggregate demand. External demand for German exports has continued
to show strength longer than in previous periods of expansion. When
the anti-inflationary efforts of the United States, the United Kingdom
and France take effect and lead to a reduction of those countries' im-
port demands, however, there should be some tendency to ease the pressure
on German resources. In view of these factors, it may be that the cur-
rent boom can be held in check without requiring drastic additional
restrictive policies. A revaluation of the DM, appropriate on other
grounds, would also help to contain inflationary pressures.

IV -15
The rate of industrial capacity utilization reached 90 per
cent in April, a level not attained since the fourth quarter of 1960.
An increasing number of firms are reporting labor shortages. Unemploy-
ment, at 0.5 per cent of the labor force in June (compared to 1.1 per
cent a year earlier), is almost non-existent; vacancies outnumber job
applicants by nearly five to one. Labor requirements are being filled
by drawing in foreign workers. The number of foreign workers has risen
from nearly 1.0 million at the bottom of the recession in August 1967 to
a new all-time high of 1.4 million in June. Firms are turning increas-
ingly to overtime to expand production.
Substantial productivity gains have so far held price pressures
under control. However, productivity has risen more slowly during the
early months of 1969 than in 1968. These slower productivity advances,
combined with sizable wage and salary increases which are expected to
result from the wage rounds scheduled this autumn--as well as the lack
of excess capacity--might lead to more marked price increases later
this year. Nevertheless, considering the advanced stage of the cycle,
productivity increases this year have been surprisingly large. Profit
margins, therefore, are under much less pressure than normal at this
cyclical stage.
Industrial production advanced at an annual rate of more than
14 per cent from the second half of 1968 to the average of the first
five months of this year--following annual rates of increase of 11 and
14 per cent in the first and second halves of 1968, respectively.

IV -16
Since new orders have risen more rapidly--at rates of 14 and 25 per cent
in the first and second halves of 1968 and by 25 per cent in January-May
1969--order backlogs in industry are increasing significantly. Order
backlogs increased from the equivalent of 3.7 months sales in March of
this year to 4.1 months in June--a level matched only at the time of
the 1961 boom.
The French economy is showing continued strength. Industrial
production rose 10 per cent in the year ended April, and in May re-
mained steady. Because of the progressive absorption of margins of
unused resources following last year's unrest, firms are finding it
harder to increase production. The restrictive measures already applied
or announced appear to be appropriate on both domestic and external
grounds.
Surveys by INSEE (French Statistical Institute) indicate
that nearly one-half of responding businessmen claim that they do not
expect further production increases because of skilled labor shortages.
(The booming economy has been slow, however, to absorb unemployed workers
with limited skills). At the end of June, there were nearly two job-
seekers for every unfilled vacancy, whereas a year before the ratio was
eight to one. Order positions are very strong and inventories unusually
low.
Private investment this year is projected to show an increase
of 22 per cent (in real terms) over 1968. The relatively high rate of
increase in investment spending is in part due to a low level in 1968,

IV -17
but reflects also the effects of tax incentives for investment enacted
in September 1968. The credit tightening and the expiration on June 1
of tax incentives for investment have thus far not led to a significant
reduction of investment intentions. For 1970 the private sector plans
to increase investment by 16 per cent over this year's level.
Consumer demand has remained vigorous. Retail sales advanced
steadily through the first quarter of this year, but eased somewhat in
the second quarter. Consumer behavior will be much affected by the
degree of confidence in the franc. A recurrence of speculative pressures
against the franc in foreign exchange markets would be likely to result
in a renewed consumer buying spree and might necessitate additional
restrictive measures.
Prices continue to rise sharply. The cost of living increased
by half a percentage point in each of the three months ended May, ad-
vanced further by 0.3 per cent in June, and was up by 6.5 per cent over
the year. Price developments will be influenced by the results of the
wage negotiations scheduled to take place in September.
The expansion of economic activity in Belgium has quickened
this year. Increasing, and probably accelerating, demand for plant
and equipment has been accompanied by strong increases in private con-
sumption and in exports. Capacity utilization in manufacturing is said
to be higher than at the peak of the previous boom in 1964. Order back-
logs soared steadily from the equivalent of approximately 3 months'

IV -18
output in April 1968 to about 4.5 months in May 1969. This movement was
from an all-time low to an all-time high since this statistical series
was begun in 1958. Since last November, manufacturers' stocks of finished
goods have been lower than at any time since late 1963.
Unemployment in Belgium has been declining since the summer
of 1968, but the labor market is not yet as tight as in the preceding
boom. Much of the remaining unemployment, however, is structural and
regional. Increases in wages have accelerated this year; the year-to-
year rise in hourly earnings in manufacturing, mining and transportation
was 7.6 per cent in March compared with 5.6 per cent for 1968 as a whole.
However, increases have not been as rapid as in 1963-64, when they were
close to 10 per cent a year. Although the upswing has not yet resulted
in rapid price increases--wholesale prices of finished goods advanced
1.4 per cent from December 1968 to May 1969, compared with a nominal
decline in the corresponding period last year--fears that the boom may
get out control have led the authorities to adopt restrictive measures.
The increase of the discount rate from 6 to 7 per cent on July 31,
unlike the increases during the spring, was influenced less by external
considerations than by domestic developments.
The Dutch economy appears to be experiencing inflationary
pressures, originating to a large extent in external demand. Industrial
production is expanding rapidly; by April it was 12 per cent above the
level a year earlier. Exports in May recorded an 18 per cent year-over-
year increase. The margins of unused capacity and excess labor, which

IV -20
reduced to all-time lows during the second quarter. These developments
have been accompanied by higher levels of industrial employment and
mounting labor shortages which are equal to previous cyclical highs reached
in 1964-65.
In Canada, the expansion of economic activity continued during
the spring, although at a subdued pace. There are signs that the policies
undertaken to curb inflationary pressures are starting to take effect.
Retail sales have declined since February, and in March-May averaged
0.2 per cent below December-February. Manufacturers' new orders peaked
in February, then fell for three consecutive months, so that in March-
May they were practically unchanged from the previous three-month period.
Housing starts declined by 19 per cent in the second quarter following
a 19 per cent rise in the previous quarter.
Industrial production in the first quarter of this year was
nearly unchanged from the very high levels attained in the previous
quarter, then showed monthly declines in both April and May. The May
index was 2.7 per cent below the March peak. The figures for April and
May, however, have been affected by strikes, and thus exaggerate the
extent of reduction in demand pressures. The unemployment rate averaged
4.8 per cent in the second quarter, up sharply from the 4.3 per cent in
the first three months of 1969. These high rates of unemployment partly
reflect the recent influx into the labor force of large numbers of
teenagers--creating a statistical problem of seasonal adjustment--as well
as structural and regional unemployment. The pace of expansion in
economic activity has been uneven among the provinces.

IV -21
Because of built-in pressures, it is likely that it may take
several months before the rate of price advance is reduced to a more
acceptable level. Both the consumer and wholesale price indices in
June were 5.2 per cent above their year earlier levels.
Japan is continuing to experience buoyant demand conditions.
Although inflationary pressures are not yet approaching alarming propor-
tions, officials are starting to express concern regarding the pace of
the upswing.
Following a very small increase in industrial production in
the early months of 1969, the pace of economic activity has quickened
again. Industrial output in the second quarter was 6.6 per cent above
the January-March level. Plant and equipment investment, as well as
private consumption, have resumed a strong rising trend. Capacity
utilization has remained high and the labor market has been tight. The
ratio of job vacancies to job seekers has risen continuously over the
past year. Machinery new orders have increased further and in May were
up by one-fourth over the level a year-earlier.
Finished goods inventories increased moderately further through
May, but inventories of raw materials have been declining since February.
Although prices are advancing--consumer prices in May were 5 per cent
over the level a year earlier--the rise is not excessive compared to the
average rate of price increases of recent years.

APPENDIX A: PRELIMINARY FEDERAL BUDGET RESULTS FOR FISCAL 1969 1/
The Federal budget surplus for fiscal 1969 turned out to be
$3.1 billion, $2.2 billion larger than was being projected by the
Administration as late as May 20. Receipts had been underestimated
by $1.3 billion, and expenditures overestimated by $900 million.
The unanticipated overrun in receipts came chiefly from a
surge in tax payments from individuals, with incomes growing faster
in the final quarter of the fiscal year than the Administration had
allowed for. With corporate profits behaving more sluggishly than
they had projected for this quarter, however, a sizable part of the
gain in receipts from individuals was offset by smaller than estimated
tax payments on corporate incomes.
On the spending side, while defense outlays and interest
payments not too surprisingly ran ahead of the Administration's May 20
forecast, shortfalls in other outlays more than offset these overruns.
A large part of these other savings reflected lags in the allocation
of funds under programs of the Department of Housing and Urban Development
chiefly the Model Cities program. But shortfalls were also widely
scattered through programs in other nondefense programs, possibly a
result of hedging to insure that total departmental outlays did not
exceed expenditure ceilings.

The Board staff's May estimate of total receipts for fiscal
1969 was nearly on target with published figures, although there were
some offsetting misses among the components. Because the staff
estimating techniques appear to be working fairly well and because
Budget totals are still preliminary in any event, there appears to be
little need to adjust current staff receipts estimates for fiscal
1970 to take account of the fiscal 1969 results.
The staff estimate of fiscal 1969 outlays was nearly $1.5
billion too high, mainly in defense. Although leading indicators of
defense spending had been pointing down for several months, a trend
which had been reflected in staff spending estimates, actual outlays
dropped a little faster than the staff had anticipated. The fiscal
1969 record does not appreciably change the outlook for fiscal 1970,
however, since some tapering off of defense spending had already been
built into staff projections.
In the nondefense sector, the staff, like the Administration,
assumed that HUD outlays would be larger in fiscal 1969 than they actually
were. This shortfall will probably be reversed in the current fiscal
year as the Model Cities program gains momentun. But some of the
other programs that fell short in the preliminary expenditure figures
for fiscal 1969 may be revised upward before the 1969 results are
finalized. With agency budget officers now facing a new expenditure
ceiling for fiscal 1970, those whose programs fell below last year's
ceiling--and this includes defense--may find it to their advantage to
back-date checks and raise fiscal 1969 outlays.
In short, despite the larger than projected surplus shown
by the preliminary Federal Budget figures for fiscal 1969, there seems
to be little reason at this point to use these results as the basis
for significant revisions in staff forecasts of the Federal Budget
outlook for fiscal 1970.
