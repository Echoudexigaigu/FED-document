SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK
Outlook for economic activity
Growth of total GNP in the current quarter is anticipated to
about equal the $16 billion increase of the second quarter, but a
marked slowing is still expected in the fourth quarter. There has been
increasing evidence recently of the impact of fiscal and monetary
restraints in dampening private demands, although substantial price
pressures persist and some economic indicators are still relatively
strong. Residential construction activity has continued to decline
sharply, with housing starts off by almost one fourth from the first
quarter. Retail sales through late August have shown little or no
growth, with real takings continuing below year-earlier levels; unit
sales of domestic cars in July and August were down by about half a
million from the second quarter average. Moreover, revised data will
show no increase in employment and slower growth of income and industrial
production in July than was originally reported.
The third quarter rise in GNP is being sustained by the
increase in Federal expenditures associated with the recent pay raise.
Growth in private final sales appears to be slowing and is likely to be
over $3 billion less than in the second quarter. In the fourth quarter
Federal purchases are expected to resume their downtrend of earlier
this year, with sharp cuts in prospect for defense spending. In addition,
the recent Commerce-SEC survey indicates that growth in business fixed
investment outlays is likely to continue to slow.

I-2
Residential construction activity is now expected to drop
more than had formerly been projected, given the cumulative impact of
credit restraint and high interest rates. Housing starts are now pro-
jected to decline to a rate of 1.2 million units in the fourth quarter.
A further cut in GNP growth is anticipated in the first half
of 1970. Inventory accumulation in the latter part of 1969 is expected
to be partly involuntary, as final demands for goods weaken. This is
likely to lead to production cutbacks and to a sharply reduced rate of
inventory accumulation. With employment leveling off and expansion in
wages and salaries dampened, only modest increases in consumer spending
are anticipated, despite the projected reduction of the tax surcharge
to 5 per cent on January 1. In these circumstances, real GNP growth
would probably halt, or turn slightly negative, and the rise in costs
and prices should moderate somewhat.
Outlook for resource use and prices
The large downward revision in the initial employment
estimates, concentrated in manufacturing, is resulting in a sizable
reduction in the preliminary July estimate of industrial production,
and thereby in a reduction in the rate of capacity utilization in manu-
facturing. Our projections for GNP and industrial production suggest
that, with capacity continuing to rise about as much as in recent years,
the capacity utilization rate by mid-1970 is likely to be well below its
recent level.

I-3
With the rate of real economic growth expected to slow and
possibly turn negative, the advance in employment will also slow, with
no increase expected in the first half of next year. The unemployment
rate is likely to continue to edge irregularly higher to mid-1970.
Currently, however, the labor market remains relatively tight and the
August unemployment rate may be little changed from July.
The sharp rise in consumer prices has put a high floor under
workers' wage demands, but collective bargaining has involved relatively
few workers this year--thus limiting the impact of large settlements on
average hourly earnings--and it will continue light until early 1970.
Moreover, pressures on wages are likely to ease as demand for labor
weakens. We therefore anticipate a further slowing of the increase in
average hourly earnings.
Prices have continued to rise rapidly this summer, apart from
the recent decline in wholesale farm and food prices. In the face of
rising costs, wholesale prices of industrial commodities are unlikely to
level off or decline unless demands weaken appreciably further. As to
consumer prices, it appears unlikely that foods will continue to push up
the over-all index as much as they have so far this year, although pros-
pects for meat supplies are still unclear. Prices of most services will
continue to rise rapidly. In summary, we continue to project a moderate
slowing in the pace of price increase to mid-1970, with softening demands
and easing availability of resources offsetting the influence of further
increases in costs.

I -4
Prospective demand for funds
With corporate liquidity already at a reduced level and
business outlays continuing to exceed internally generated funds by
a wide margin, payments on September income taxes and for Alaskan
oil leases are likely to extend the rate of business loan growth
evident at banks during August. Corporate tax payments in September
are expected to be larger than a year ago partly because catch-up
payments are now due for the period in which the surtax was allowed
to lapse. Beyond September, however, growth in business loans at
banks should moderate, even though credit demands may be augmented
somewhat by inventory accumulation.
With lendable funds at banks limited, some of the enlarged
September business demands will undoubtedly spill-over from banks to
the commercial paper market. Banks themselves, in fact, are likely to
remain active on the demand side of commercial paper markets through
operations of their holding companies.
While corporate financing now estimated for September and
October in longer-term capital markets is larger than the seasonally
low August volume, total security offerings are expected to remain
well below the average monthly volume evident earlier this year, and
underwriters report no widespread pick-up of security offerings by
industrial firms. Apparently most of the underwriters' large industrial
customers have enough financial flexibility--given the expected leveling
off capital outlays over the next few quarters--to await the better
market conditions still generally anticipated later in the year.

I -5
State and local government demands on capital markets, while
potentially very large, continue to be heavily rationed by market yields
in excess of official interest rate ceilings. Moreover, with the
ultimate tax treatment of interest on State and local securities still
uncertain, there is little immediate prospect of significant near-term
yield declines. Thus, the volume of new municipal bond offerings in
September should remain relatively low. While a part of this expected
short-fall in bond volume will probably continue to be made up through
short-term financing, total borrowing is likely to remain well below
State and local government plants. Looking farther ahead, however,
if yields should turn down appreciably, municipal bond volume would
respond quickly.
The Federal Government is not expected to be a cash borrower
again until late October or early November. But refinancing of the
large October 1 Treasury debt maturities ($5.7 billion of which are
held by the public) will be exerting a substantial near-term
influence on securities markets. The terms of this financing are
expected to be announced around mid-September. Total borrowing in
the public sector will also be augmented by the Federal Home Loan
Bank System and the FNMA which together may be acquiring as much as
$1.3 billion of additional new money in September and October.
Consumer instalment credit rose more moderately in July
than in over a year apparently because of reduced auto sales, and
with auto sales expected to remain at a lower level, instalment credit
growth should continue moderate.

I- 6
Prospective supplies of funds
Given current monetary policy, deposits at commercial banks
and thrift institutions will remain under pressure. Attrition in
large negotiable time CD's at banks is likely to remain relatively
large, influenced in part by the generally reduced corporate liquidity
and the quarterly bulge in corporate tax payments.
While net drains from consumer-type time and savings deposits
should be halted in September, the reversal of trend is not likely to
proceed far enough to provide any appreciable net deposit growth at
banks. Nor is growth of demand deposits likely to add much to their
lending power. Since inflows of funds from nondeposit sources have
moderated as changes in reserve regulations have gone into effect and
are likely to continue less expansive, banks should be forced to con-
tinue liquidating securities and retaining other types of loans in
order to meet the demands of their preferred business customers.
Savings flows to thrift institutions will come under particular
pressure in the late September and early October quarterly reinvestment
period. There is some concern that these pressures may be aggravated
by high yielding new Treasury and Federal agency issues being offered
in September and early October. Through the fall period, therefore,
there appears to be little prospect that the thrift institutions will
show much, if any, improvement in savings flows from their recent weak
experience.

I- 7
Given this outlook, and with insurance companies also
strapped for funds, further curtailment would appear to be in prospect
for new residential mortgage lending commitments. This seems probable
even with the recently enlarged support given to the market by FNMA,
in addition to continued lender efforts to supplement savings flows
by drawing down liquidity and borrowing from the Federal Home Loan
Banks.
In the weeks ahead, limitation on the availability of funds
may lead to some further yield advances in the municipal bond and
mortgage markets; expanded FHLB and FNMA borrowing will tend to maintain
upward pressures on the Federal agency market; and yields on U.S.
Government securities may not yet have adjusted fully to the imminent
refinancing. But given the extent to which interest rates have already
risen, further increase of rates may be moderate. Indeed, any signifi-
cant economic news which lends support to expectations of a near-term
cooling of the economy might trigger a general rate decline, particularly
in long-term markets.
International Outlook
The summer months do not seem to be bringing much relief from
the unsatisfactory performance of the U.S. balance of payments in the
first half. Moreover, the devaluation of the French franc has raised

I-8
the possibility of further devaluations against the dollar but has not
increased the likelihood of a German revaluation. Nevertheless, the
market and the press have not been registering much concern about the
dollar, and are apparently favorably impressed by progress toward the
introduction of SDR's.
In July, and probably again in August, the liquidity deficit
(not seasonally adjusted) was a little over $1 billion. Allowing for
adverse seasonal factors in the third quarter, this may be a little
better than the huge second quarter deficit rate. Early estimates of
the second quarter accounts suggest that while there have been
temporary factors that tend to inflate this deficit measure (especially
flows of U.S. funds to the Euro-dollar market) most of the worsening
in the accounts through June occurred in the basic current and capital
accounts. Early estimates for direct investment transactions in the
first half show a sharp rise in capital outflows while income receipts
were levelling off.
Merchandise trade showed a bare surplus in July, and the
balance for the rest of the year is not expected to be large enough
to raise the annual figure above the low rate of 1968. However, modest
gains in the trade and service accounts are expected from the extra-
ordinarily weak first half.

I- 9
Most of the expected positive effects of monetary and
fiscal restraint on the current account of the balance of payments
still lie ahead. In spite of monetary restraint, the outflow of U.S.
private capital (apart from circular flows) was apparently quite
substantial in the first half, and is likely to ease off in the rest
of the year. Drawdowns of funds from the Euro-dollar market by U.S.
banks were still large in July but moderated somewhat in August. The
official settlements balance showed only a small surplus in July and
probably registered a deficit last month. While taut credit markets
underpin the effort to reduce outflows of U.S. private capital through
direct controls, there are also significant short-term balance of
payments costs involved as interest payments rise and inflows of
foreign capital to buy U.S. stocks are discouraged.

THE ECONOMIC PICTURE IN DETAIL
Domestic Nonfinancial Scene
Gross national product. Inflationary pressures continue
widespread and some economic indicators are still relatively strong.
But there has also been additional evidence in recent weeks of a further
easing of private demands. Residential construction activity has moved
sharply downward--with housing starts dropping faster than expected--and
retail sales have continued to show little strength. Earlier indications
of some easing of the labor market have become more pronounced, with a
sharp downward revision in the July nonfarm employment figures. This
revision will weaken the July rise in private wage and salary income and
trim away part of the increase in industrial production.
Over-all GNP in the current quarter is now expected to rise by
about $16 billion, slightly more than we had previously projected and
about equal to the revised second quarter increase. But this largely
reflects the rise in Federal spending associated with the pay raise;
growth in private final sales expected to be smaller, by over $3 billion.
Last quarter turned out to be a bit weaker than had been
estimated earlier in the first official report. Revised GNP figures now
show a $16.1 billion increase, about the same as in the two preceding
quarters. In real terms, however, growth in total output is now estimated
to have edged down for the fourth consecutive quarter to about a 2 per
cent annual rate.

II -2
An appreciable further decline in the rate of growth of GNP
in both current dollars and in real terms is anticipated in the fourth
quarter. After year-end, with most sectors either declining or expanding
less than earlier, a further loss of momentum in GNP growth is expected.
Little or no increase is likely in real output during the first half of
1970.
Although the Federal pay raise in July, along with completion
of payments on 1968 income tax liabilities, should increase disposable
income sharply this quarter, consumer expenditures now appear unlikely
to show any exceptional strength. This would imply a rise in the saving
rate from the relatively low second quarter level. Retail sales have
been sluggish since last fall and in real terms have apparently been
below year-earlier levels for the past three months. Sales of new
domestic autos dipped to about an 8 million rate in July and also in
the first 20 days of August from 8.5 million in the second quarter; a
sales rate of about 8.1 million now seems a reasonable projection for
the current quarter as a whole.
Construction has reacted more sharply to tighter money market
conditions than we had earlier thought probable. Housing starts in July
dropped again--by 9 per cent--for the sixth consecutive month to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.34 million units, and construction
outlays are now projected to drop somewhat faster and further than we
had estimated. Starts in the third quarter are now projected to dip to
a 1.25 million annual rate, and residential construction spending to be
off by over $2 billion. For the fourth quarter, starts may be down to a

II -3
1.2 million rate, and outlays off an additional $2 billion, to a level
about 15 per cent below the first quarter.
A slightly more rapid rate of inventory accumulation is
expected to add slightly to GNP growth in the current quarter. Book
value of manufacturer's inventories rose by almost $900 million in July,
and with retail sales continuing sluggish through both July and August,
a somewhat larger accumulation of stocks at retail also probably is
taking place.
Looking beyond the present quarter, growth of business fixed
capital outlays--a major spur to over-all expansion this year--appears
likely to weaken perceptibly. Gains in new orders for machinery and
equipment in the second quarter--partly reflecting anticipation of the
requested repeal of the investment tax credit--and a pick up in manu-
facturer's capital appropriations, do suggest a further moderate rise in
plant and equipment spending. But the most recent Commerce-SEC survey
(taken mainly in August) indicates a leveling off in these expenditures
by about year-end. Both the recent Commerce-SEC and McGraw-Hill surveys
show a downward revision of anticipated 1969 expenditure levels, and the
influence may be drawn that some of the shortfall from earlier spending
plans is being pushed forward into 1970. Although the recent McGraw-Hill
survey indicates a 5 per cent increase for 1970 as a whole, this implies
little if any increase in physical volume. With credit conditions tight
and with the expected slowing in over-all growth, it is quite possible
that even in current dollars little further increase may occur in the
first half of 1970.

II -4
Federal government purchases of goods and services have
declined steadily in the past few quarters and apart from the pay raise,
these expenditures are expected to continue to edge down in the next
several quarters. Although new defense orders rebounded in July after
two months of decline, this was probably a temporary surge reflecting a
bunching of orders. In fact, it seems clear from recent announcements
that defense spending is likely to be reduced by more than had generally
been assumed earlier. On the other hand, commitments for non-defense
programs suggest an offsetting rise in civilian expenditures, rather than
the level rate of spending previously projected. However, a recent
statement by the Administration suggests the distinct possibility of a
cut in Federal construction expenditures as well. As a temporary measure
until the expenditures outlook is clearer, we have revised the distribu-
tion of Federal spending between defense and non-defense but have kept
the over-all projected levels consistent with a $192.9 billion unified
budget level for fiscal 1970.
In summary, a substantially slower growth in final sales is
projected for the fourth quarter, as the decline in Federal purchases is
resumed along with a further sharp cut in residential construction
activity and a tapering-off of the rise of fixed investment spending.
However, the dip in final sales may be partly offset for a time by a
higher rate of inventory accumulation, to some extent unintended. GNP
growth is thus projected to drop to under $12 billion in the fourth
quarter and real growth to about a one per cent annual rate.

II -5
But with final sales continuing to show relatively little
growth, business inventory policies are likely to come increasingly into
question. Thus, we have projected inventory accumulation to dip sharply
after year-end. Gains in employment and income would be reduced sub-
stantially by this and other retardent factors and only modest increases
in consumer spending are expected. In these conditions--with real GNP
showing little or no increase--pressure on resources would lessen signif-
icantly, and the advance in prices would be expected to moderate. We
estimate the GNP deflator to be easing to about a 3 per cent rate of
increase by mid-year.
These projections assume that the tax surcharge will be
extended at a 5 per cent rate for the first half of 1970 and that the
investment tax credit will be eliminated. We are also assuming that a
generally restrictive monetary policy will be maintained somewhat longer
than formerly expected. Elimination of the surcharge entirely on
January 1 would result in an additional rise in disposable income of
about $4.5 billion, which would likely be reflected in a significant
extra increase in consumption of perhaps $3.5 billion. Corporate after-
tax earnings would also be somewhat higher, although it is questionable
what effect this would have on business spending in the near term.

Industrial production. An unusually large downward revision
in the July manufacturing manhours data, as shown in the table, (con-
fidential until release September 8) indicates a substantial downward
revision in the preliminary July production index.
PRODUCTION WORKER MANHOURS
Per cent change
June to July June to July Amount of
Preliminary Revised July Revision

Durable .9 -.2 -1.3
Nondurable .0 -.2 -.2
Revisions in manhours were widespread but were especially large in the
durable goods industries, including electrical and nonelectrical machinery,
in which manhour data are used extensively in estimation of the current
index. Both production worker employment and average weekly hours were
revised and, as indicated in the table, a .6 per cent rise in total manu-
facturing manhours from June to July was revised to a .2 per cent decline.
On the basis of the July manhours revision and the sketchy
output data now available for August, it appears that the upward momentum
in production shown in the first half of the year has moderated consider-
ably. Unless manufacturing employment was significantly stronger in
August than in July, the production index, at best, rose only fractionally
in August. Available data on physical volume do not suggest much renewed
strength. Auto assemblies, after allowance for the model changeover

II -9
period, were maintained at an annual rate of 9.0 million units, but
sales of domestic autos in the first 20 days of August continued at an
8.0 million rate. Output of television sets in early August remained
at the reduced July level. Production of raw steel declined. Output of
crude oil and activity at petroleum refineries continued at about the
July rate. Coal production was curtailed somewhat in August because of
wildcat strikes.
Retail sales. Retail sales are estimated to have increased
about 1 per cent in August, on the basis of weekly data through August 23.
But this increase follows a likely downward revision in the advance July
estimate, and on balance sales have edged up only slightly over the past
few months. In real terms, sales have probably run below year-earlier
levels, at least from June through August this year.
Sales apparently increased at both durable and nondurable goods
starts in August. In the durable goods category, increased sales in the
automotive groups were only partially offset by considerably weaker
furniture and appliance sales. Sales were up at most types of nondurable
good stores; a decline at department stores was apparently the major
exception.
Dealer deliveries of new domestic autos in the first 20 days
of August were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 8.0 million units,
little changed from July but 10 per cent below a year earlier. Sales of
new imported cars in July totaled 97,000 units; an increase of 9 per cent
over a year earlier. Stocks of new domestic autos, at 1.3 million units,
were five per cent larger than a year ago.

II -10
Used car sales in July were at a seasonally adjusted annual
rate of 9 million units, moderately larger than in July and 4 per cent
below a year earlier. Used car stocks were unchaged from a year earlier.
Seasonally adjusted auction prices in July continued to show little
change.
Consumer credit. Growth in consumer instalment credit
slackened markedly in July, after the substantial rise experienced in
the spring quarter. Instalment credit outstanding expanded at a season-
ally adjusted annual rate of about $7-1/2 billion in July compared with
$9.6 billion in the second quarter and $8.3 billion in the first.
Weakness in unit sales of domestic autos was reflected in a
sharp reduction in auto credit growth. Other factors dampening expan-
sion of auto credit in July may have been a shift toward smaller and less
expensive models (import sales were strong and Maverick sales enabled
Ford to expand its market share), and lower selling prices for used cars.

Cyclical indicators. The Census composite leading indicator
decreased slightly in July but remained near its April peak; in addition,
revised data virtually eliminated the June increase previously reported.
Recent movements of this indicator do not lead to any obvious interpreta-
tion. Hesitation at an advanced level is somewhat uncommon in this
series, though at the time of the 1957 downturn it had showed little
change for a year and a half.
The preliminary coincident and lagging composites also
increased. The coincident composite does not yet incorporate the revi-
sion in the July employment data, which will lower three of its five
components.

Of the individual leading indicators available for July,
decreases occurred in nonagricultural job placements, contracts and
orders for plant and equipment, housing permits, and common stock prices.
The manufacturing workweek was unchanged, although it declined in durable
goods industries. Durable new orders, industrial materials prices, and
the ratio of price to unit labor cost were up. It is true that the July

II -12
decrease in the leading composite was mainly caused by the drop in
housing permits, but it is also true that this drop was almost offset in
the composite by the spurt in defense orders, which is not likely to be
sustained.
The preliminary indexes of common stock and materials prices
rose in August, the latter rather sharply. Of all twelve leading indi-
cators, only the industrial materials price index can be said to look
strong in recent months.
Manufacturers' orders and shipments. An increase of over $1
billion in new orders for defense products was the principal factor
raising July orders for durable goods 5 per cent above the reduced June
level. Defense orders had been unusually low in May and June owing to
major defense contract cancellations, and the July spurt may reflect
some bunching of new contract awards in the aerospace and communications
equipment industries at the beginning of the new fiscal year. The July
level of defense orders is about the same as previous highs reached over
the past year and a half in this volatile series.
Iron and steel orders increased $200 million to the highest
level since the stockpiling of a year and a half ago--perhaps partly in
anticipation of the price increases expected (and later realized) in
August.
Factory orders for consumer household durables also increased
in July, by $100 million. The value of orders for construction materials
was off $100 million, and orders for machinery and equipment declined
about $150 million.

II -13
Durable shipments changed little, and the durables order
backlog increased, owing to higher unfilled orders at primary and fabri-
cated metals and machinery industries. In spite of the spurt in defense
orders, backlogs fell in the aerospace industry, as work stoppages ended
and shipments jumped.
Inventories. The book value of manufactuers' inventories rose
by nearly $900 million in July, following little change in June. The
increase was all at durable manufacturers, where the accumulation was
the largest of any month since August 1966. Durable manufacturers'
ratios of inventories to sales and to order backlogs, already high, rose
further. Much of the inventory increase was in work in process at busi-
ness and defense equipment industries; durable manufacturers' materials
holdings increased by only $100 million.

Trade inventories increased by a substantial $500 million in
June, but for the second quarter as a whole accumulation was about the
same as in the first quarter. The distributors' inventory-sales ratio
rose in June back to the April level; this ratio, at 1.36 months' sales,
is fairly high by historical standards, but still below levels recorded
early this year and in late 1966.
Plant and equipment. Recent surveys of planned capital
spending by business suggest a lower level of expenditures for 1969 than
had been indicated by previous surveys this year. Anticipated spending
for 1970 was revised up, but in real terms the expected year to year
increase is nominal.
The August Commerce-SEC survey of capital spending plans
reveals that businessmen plan to invest $70.9 billion in new plant and
equipment in 1969, 10.6 per cent more than in 1968. This is substantially
greater than the 4 per cent increase of 1968, but it is a further downward
revision from the 14 per cent planned in February and the 12.6 per cent
planned in May. A special recheck of their Spring survey by McGraw-Hill
shows a similar downward revision for 1969--a reduction from a 13 per
cent increase planned in late April to an 11 per cent increase anticipated
in August.

The quarterly pattern of spending for 1969 in the Commerce-SEC
survey now shows a downward revision of $2 billion in the third quarter,
but an increase of about that magnitude is planned for the third quarter,
followed by a leveling off in the fourth. There has been a fairly con-
sistent pattern thus far in 1969 of actual spending falling short of
anticipations; most, but not all, of the shortfall has been shifted into
the following quarter's anticipation. Commerce-SEC extended the period
covered by the August survey by one quarter, and the results indicate
an increase in spending in the first quarter of 1970. However, these
results are quite tentative and will not be published.

Among the industries covered in the Commerce-SEC survey, the
largest relative cutbacks in planned increases in 1969 were in nondurable

II -16
manufacturing, railroad and nonrailroad transportation, and public
utilities. All manufacturing plans are off somewhat more than nonmanu-
facturing.
The recent McGraw-Hill survey indicates an upward revision in
plans for next year. In April all businesses combined planned to spend
1 per cent more in 1970 than in 1969; in the recheck they indicated plans
for a 5 per cent increase. Taking into consideration recent and pros-
pective price rises this would suggest little or no increase in physical
volume for 1970 as a whole.
The downward revisions in 1969 plans indicated by the two
surveys (and also by the informal Federal Reserve survey) reflect a
variety of influences including labor and/or capacity shortages which
have delayed installations, the proposed repeal of the 7 per cent invest-
ment tax credit--especially in the case of transportation companies;
inability to obtain financing on satisfactory terms, and in some cases
probably a less optimistic view of future prospects. It is possible that
some of these factors will still be affecting investment decisions in
early 1970, and even the moderate current dollar spending increase indi-
cated by the McGraw-Hill survey may not be realized.
In another study, capital authorizations of the 1,000 largest
manufacturing firms surveyed by the NICB rose 12.6 per cent in the second
quarter. Some of this increase was attributed by the NICB to the pro-
posed repeal of the investment tax credit, and they indicated that the
third and fourth quarter authorizations are likely to be lower. Author-
izations are generally expended over a period of six to nine months after

II -17
approval. This suggests that spending by these firms, which accounted
for about 9 per cent of the Commerce-SEC second quarter total, could
remain high through the first quarter of 1970 unless the reasons mentioned
above force delays or cancellations of already approved projects. Back-
logs of unspent appropriations rose sharply in the second quarter as did
actual capital expenditures.
Construction and real estate. The value of new construction
put in place during August was little changed from the downward-revised
July rate. However, reflecting the continued decline in housing starts,
residential outlays fell for the fifth consecutive month in August, and
at $28.5 billion were more than 11 per cent below the high reached in
March. Nonresidential outlays showed no change from the advanced July
pace. Offsetting a part of the decline in the private sector, public
construction rose to a near record level.

Seasonally adjusted private housing starts declined in July
for the sixth consecutive month, to an annual rate of 1.34 million units--
the lowest since June 1967. Unlike most earlier months this year, the
July decline was most pronounced in the multifamily sector. Regionally,
it was sharpest in the Northeast, which is still hampered by relatively
low usury ceilings, but all regions showed some drop-off from June.

preliminary.
Seasonally adjusted building permits also fell 10 per cent in
July from the upward-revised June rate and, at 1.21 million, were at the
lowest rate in over a year. The July declines in starts and permits
appear to reflect mainly the increasing stringency of funds available to
both builders and home-buyers, but labor disputes in some local areas of
the West and Mid-west, as well as further rapid increases in construction
and land costs, also probably tended to dampen starts activity. Because

II -19
of the limited supply of credit and the reluctance or inability of some
buyers to pay the current high mortgage interest rates, field reports
indicate that more builders are now starting a dwelling only after it
has been sold and permanent financing has been arranged.
The quarterly starts projection has been further reduced,
principally on the basis of a less optimistic outlook for savings
inflows to thrift institutions over the remainder of the year along with
continued high mortgage interest rates. It is now expected that starts
will decline to an annual rate of 1.2 million units in the fourth quarter
and remain at or near this level through at least the winter months.
While increased financial market pressures are curtailing
the outlook for starts activity this year, basic shelter demand remains
quite strong. Average vacancy rates in the second quarter changed little
from the low first quarter levels for the nation as a whole. In the
second quarter, both rental and homeowner vacancy rates were the lowest
for any comparable period since 1957, with an uninterrupted decline since
1965.

Labor market. The only new labor market information presently
available for August is the weekly insured unemployment series. Initial
claims for unemployment insurance had risen quite sharply through late
July but now appear to have edged back slightly since early August,
suggesting a leveling off of the over-all unemployment rate near the July
figure. The over-all rate had moved up to 3.6 per cent in July from 3.4
per cent in June.
Indications of some easing in the labor market in July were
reinforced by a large downward revision of the July payroll employment
estimate. The revised data (confidential until Sept. 8) show a slight
decline in nonfarm payroll employment, whereas the preliminary figures
had shown an increase of nearly 200,000.
There were small downward revisions in most industry sectors,
but the main adjustment was in manufacturing, where an initially reported
advance of 94,000 was replaced by a decline of 12,000. Within manufac-
turing, the downward revisions were widely distributed and the July data
now show only marginal employment advances in the capital-goods industries,
stability or very slight declines in the consumer-goods and defense
industries, and employment reductions in construction-related industries
such as stone, clay and glass, and lumber.
Average weekly hours in durable-goods manufacturing were also
revised. They now show a decline of one-tenth of an hour in July and are
off three-tenths of an hour from this year's high of 41.5 hours in March.

II -21
Income and wages. Because of the extra stimulus provided by
the Federal pay increase, personal income rose by $6 billion in July to
a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $752.3 billion. Exclusive of the
government sector, however, the rise in wages and salaries slowed markedly
further and we anticipate a downward revision in these figures as a
result of the reduction in the July nonfarm payroll employment figures.

Growth of private wage and salary payments has dropped off
steadily since early in the year, with all the slowing in the nonmanu-
facturing industries. The small July advance reflects the impact of
employment reductions in construction and services, and unusually slow
growth in several other industries.
Increases in average hourly earnings of production and non-
supervisory workers on private nonfarm payrolls also have slowed somewhat.
Hourly earnings increased at an annual rate of 7.3 per cent in the fourth
quarter of 1968, but slowed to a 6.6 per cent rate of increase in the

II -22
second quarter, and continued at a slower pace in July. The comparatively
light schedule of collective bargaining activity this year accounts for
much of the slowing. At the same time, however, settlements concluded
thus far in 1969 have featured very large first-year wage increases--
averaging nearly 7-1/2 per cent--which are intended to compensate for the
effect of rapidly rising prices on workers' purchasing power. In addition,
recent settlements have tended to include larger deferred wage increases--
automatic raises provided in second and third contract years--than in 1967
and 1968, suggesting continued concern about price prospects.
Wholesale prices. According to preliminary BLS estimates, the
wholesale price index edged off 0.1 per cent from mid-July to mid-August--
the first decline in a year. Not much comfort can be found here, however,
since average prices of industrial commodities rose by 0.3 per cent (the
largest monthly increase since March). Prices of farm and food products,
which have exerted a major influence on the WPI in recent months, dropped
0.9 per cent.

Price increases for steel mill products, copper, and brass
and aluminum products were mainly responsible for the increase in the
industrial average, but other important increases were registered for
machinery, apparel, rubber, and rubber products. Preliminary data indi-
cate, however, that price increases were not quite as widespread as
during the preceding several months. Prices of lumber and wood products
continued to fall for the fifth consecutive month, and gasoline prices
declined. The sharp drop in farm and food prices was mainly attributable
to lower prices for cattle, grains, eggs, meat, and vegetable oils,
reflecting improved supplies.
Among the price increases for the metals group, higher prices
for flat-rolled steel products were of particular importance. The
increases were the broadest since those established a year ago following
the wage settlement in the steel industry. Strong domestic and foreign
demand and reduced competition from imports were reflected in the August
increases, which maintained the upward trend in steel mill prices which
began last December. Other influences included the second round of wage
increases negotiated a year earlier and a sharp drop in second quarter
profits. Steel analysts expected some price increases in August, but the
broad range of products covered was generally not anticipated.
Increases for some industrial products have been announced
since mid-August, the most important being for automobiles and some non-
ferrous metals. The 1970-model automobiles, which will be introduced
later this month, are expected to be at least 2 per cent more expensive
than last year's models. Prices for copper and zinc have been increased

II -24
by some companies as strong domestic demand, high prices on the London
Metal Exchange, and strikes in Canada have put pressure on prices.
Copper has been increased 4 cents a pound--the fourth price increase this
year--to a record 52 cents a pound, and the price of zinc has been raised
for the third time this year. Several copper fabricators have increased
the price of copper products. Given present market conditions, these
increases are likely to become industry-wide.
Prices of farm and food products usually increase somewhat in
the August-September period, but with diverse trends among individual
components, a leveling in the farm and foods index seems possible.
Consumer prices. The consumer price index advanced at an
annual rate of 6.0 per cent in July to a level 5.5 per cent above a year
ago. About half the increase was due to higher food prices, mainly for
meats. Of the food price increase, about 90 per cent was seasonal. But
a rough estimate suggests that the increase for the entire index on a
seasonally adjusted basis was only moderately smaller than the 6.0 per
cent in the published index. Consumer prices increased in the first 7
months of 1969 at an annual rate greater than 6 per cent, the fastest
increase of any 7-month period since 1951.
Commodities other than food rose at a moderate 1.2 per cent
annual rate in July as higher prices for a number of items were nearly
offset by decreases for used cars, gasoline and apparel. Apparel prices
dropped less than seasonally because of fewer than usual summer clearance
sales.

II -25
Charges for services rose at a 6.0 per cent annual rate,
reflecting marked further increases in mortgage interest, property taxes
and insurance, and home maintenance and repair services. Medical care
services rose 7.2 per cent, continuing their sharp upward trend.
Consumer prices are expected to rise less in August than in
July because a smaller increase is anticipated for food. Prices of fruits
and vegetables are expected to decline seasonally in August.

Agricultural production prospects. Another year of record pro-
duction of livestock products and crops is predicted on the basis of
August 1 indications. Prices of livestock products are expected to continue

II -26
above a year earlier although the margin should narrow in the fall when
marketings increase seasonally. Production of crops, particularly some of
the world-traded crops, may exceed demand and prices stay close to price
support loan rates.
Crop output is predicted to be 2 per cent larger than last
year with acreage 2 per cent smaller. Hurricane Camille apparently did
not affect national output prospects very much. Food grain production is
predicted to be 7 per cent lower with record yields partially offsetting
a 13 per cent cutback in acreage. The feed grain and soybean crops are
likely to be little different from last year and the cotton and tobacco
crops will be larger. The deciduous fruit crop is expected to be up
11 per cent.
USDA analysts think that the 1969 feed grain and cotton crops
may equal utilization in the 1969/70 marketing year if the small increases
in exports now in prospect materialize. Net additions to stocks of soy-
beans and wheat are likely. Surplus wheat supplies have led to price-
cutting among the exporting nation members of the International Grains
Arrangement and U.S. export prospects are hard to assess at present. It
is still hoped that wheat exports will be somewhat larger than the 542
million bushels exported in 1968/69.

THE ECONOMIC PICTURE IN DETAIL
Domestic Financial Situation
Bank credit. Total loans and investments at all commercial
banks are estimated to have risen slightly in August--after exclusion
of the effects of System matched sale-purchase transactions near the
end of July--but bank credit still has declined since the end of May.
With lendable funds extremely limited, banks liquidated a large amount
of municipals for the second month in a row, although they again added
to their holdings of U.S. Government securities as they underwrote
another Treasury financing. Business loans increased substantially,
but most other types of loans changed very little, on balance, in
August.

Total bank holdings of securities have continued to decline
even though banks underwrote two sizable Treasury financings recently--
for $3.5 billion in July and $2.1 billion in August--both payable in
full by credits to tax and loan accounts. The financing-related
increases in bank holdings of U.S. Government securities were more
than offset by heavy bank liquidation of other securities in both July
and August. At large banks the August run-off took place primarily
at banks outside of New York City and continued to consist mainly of
reductions in holdings of short- and long-term municipals--although a
sizable volume of agency issues were also liquidated.
The August rise in business loans primarily reflected less
than usual declines in bank loans to machinery, transportation equip-
ment, service, and retail trade industries, the latter probably
related to financing of new car inventories by automobile dealers.
Inclusive of business loans sold by banks to holding companies and
affiliates, the rate of growth in business loans since the end of
May still has been only about one-half of that earlier in the year.
Security loans, exclusive of the effects of the matched
sale-purchase transactions, remained unchanged in August, while real
estate loans continued to expand at the sharply reduced pace of July
and consumer loans maintained the moderate rate of expansion of the
previous three months. The average monthly increase in total bank
loans in the June-August period--including loans sold by banks to
holding companies and affiliates--was only about 30 per cent of that
earlier in the year.

Bank sources of funds. Total member bank deposits, measured
on a daily average basis, fell sharply further in August, reflecting
mainly continued large declines in time and savings deposits. A
small decline in private demand deposits was nearly offset by a
rise in U.S. Government deposits. Nondeposit sources of funds
provided little relief to these deposit outflows as the net increase
in bank borrowing in the Euro-dollar market through foreign branches
was relatively small and banks raised virtually no additional
funds from other nondeposit sources.

The decline in time and savings deposits at banks in August
reflected in large part continued heavy CD attrition, with outstanding
CD's falling by an additional $860 million. As in July, most of the
August attrition occurred at banks outside of New York and Chicago,
as these outside banks lost a significantly higher proportion of
maturing issues than earlier in the year.
Consumer-type time and savings deposits at large banks also
declined substantially in August, although by much less than in July--
following midyear interest-crediting. The declines continued to be
very large at banks in New York City, and were due principally to
further sizable losses of time certificates and open accounts. Other
large banks experienced further outflows of consumer-type deposits
in August, but ata slower rate than in July. Small inflows of time
and savings deposits reappeared at country banks in early August
following the huge decline in July.
In spite of these deposit losses, banks made relatively little
use of nondeposit sources of funds in August, at least partly in
response to changes in regulations concerning these funds that have
gone into effect recently or are about to go into effect in the near
future. Banks with foreign branches borrowed only an additional $226
million in the Euro-dollar market during the first three weeks of
August, as compared with a net increase of $1.1 billion in July and
$3.4 billion in June. Moreover, as indicated by the chart on the
following page, banks have raised virtually no additional funds, on

III -5
balance, from other nondeposit sources since the end of July, as
the moderate increase in outstanding commercial paper issued through
holding companies or other bank affiliates was nearly offset by
reductions in loans sold under repurchase agreement. New issues of
the latter became subject to reserve requirements and Regulation Q
ceilings on August 28.
As shown in the following table, a relatively few banks
hold most of the funds obtained from these nondeposit sources. Banks
outside New York and Chicago account for nearly 70 per cent of these
funds, in contrast to only 15 per cent of the outstanding borrowings
in theEuro-dollar market through foreign branches. Indeed, the
heavier reliance of outside banks on these other nondeposit sources
of funds may reflect the fact that only a relatively few of them
have access to the Euro-dollar market through foreign branches.

The money stock, measured on a daily average basis, fell at
about a 2.5 per cent annual rate in August, following a 6 per cent
rate of increase in July and a 3.8 per cent rise over the first half
of the year. U.S. Government deposits rose slightly after declining
by $3.5 billion in the previous two months.
Nonbank depositary intermediaries. Considerable weakness in
net savings flows to the thrift institutions continues to be manifest,
at least at institutions in the San Francisco and New York areas which
actually lost funds on balance during the first half of August. It is
clear that withdrawals continued well after the close of the reinvest-
ment period. Although savings patterns in the two locations cited
tend to be too sensitive to provide a basis for generalization of
thrift flows in total, the marked year-over-year shortfall suggests
that the slowdown evident since the first quarter of this year is
at least continuing, if not accelerating.

* Because of seasonal adjustment difficulties, monthly patterns may

Since March, mortgage activity of the savings and loan
associations has been maintained at a very high volume, particularly
in the face of extremely modest support from savings flows. Although
mortgage return flows remain the largest single source of funds, they
have shown essentially no growth; high interest rates have inhibited
prepayments and encouraged assumptions of existing mortgages. Rather,
the $1.5 billion drawdown of liquid assets since the spring, combined
with a somewhat larger volume of borrowing, has instead provided key
support for expanded mortgage activity. Emphasis on borrowings and
reductions in liquid assets has apparently continued during August,
when savings and loan associations borrowed the $201 million of 5-
year funds raised by the FHLB System under its new policy of providing
longer-term advances. Other borrowing by the industry showed the charac-
teristic abatement from the heavy July pace, but the pattern nevertheless

III -9
suggests that relatively strong reliance continues to be placed on
this source of funds.

holdings.
The resulting decline in associations' liquidity ratios has
been large, and these ratios are now as low as they have been since 1966.
Liquid assets net of borrowed funds, for instance, amounted to less than
3 per cent of share capital in July, down from over 5 per cent as
recently as March. FHLBB policy has encouraged the decline in net
liquidity this year, both by reducing minimum required liquidity and
by maintaining a lenient stance on advances.

FHLBank and FNMA borrowing. The Federal Home Loan Banks
and the Federal National Mortgage Association have stepped up their
support of the mortgage market substantially this year in an attempt
to ease the pressures on housing caused by the reduction in net
savings inflows at thrift institutions. As a result of this increased
activity, financing needs have risen sharply, and these institutions
together have borrowed in excess of $2.9 billion in net new money
so far this year. Their new fund requirements are expected to
accelerate further over the next four months, and the Board staff now
estimates that net new funds raised by the FHLBanks and FNMA, in the
September-December period, may total as much as $2.7 billion.

With the backlog of outstanding mortgage commitments at
savings and loan associations still quite large, the reduced pattern
of savings inflows suggests that associations may borrow heavily from

III -11
the Federal Home Loan Banks during the remainder of the year. To meet
the anticipated demand for advances, the Federal Home Loan Banks are
expected to borrow an additional $1.0 billion in new money in the open
market over the next four months. Some of the short-term liquid assets
of $1.0 billion held by FHLBanks at the end of August are also available
for lending. Meanwhile, refinancing of maturing issues will total $1.3
billion over the period.
Since January, FNMA has more than doubled the weekly volume
of commitments it will accept, and is currently committing funds,
including a limited volume outside the auction system, at the rate of
$10 billion a year. Because FNMA committed a larger volume of funds
per week during the March-June period (mostly for takedown in six
months) as compared to earlier months, the volume of FNMA commitments
scheduled to mature over the next four months will rise sharply.
To finance its operation during the final third of the year, FNMA
will need to borrow an estimated $1.7 billion (including $600 million
already raised on August 28) in new funds and refinance $550 million.
Moreover, FNMA must continue to roll-over more than $900 million each
month in short-term discount notes.
Mortgage market. The availability of new commitments for
residential mortgages tightened considerably further in August,
judging from unofficial field reports and trade sources. Pressure
on lender cash flows has increased to the point that some mortgage
investors have delayed takedowns of completed mortgages ready for
delivery by originators under prior agreements. These delays, in

III -12
turn, have intensified already mounting cost pressures on such loan
originators as mortgage companies. Ever since the prime rate
increase last June in fact, costs of carrying completed mortgages
in warehouse pending delivery to final investors have substantially
exceeded net yields on warehoused loans--unlike the case in 1966.
In the secondary market for Government-underwritten mortgages,
average yields in FNMA's weekly auction--which had declined more than
20 basis points in July--drifted higher through the September 2 auction.
Yields edged up even though the weekly volume of commitments
accepted by FNMA increased during this period. At the same time,
demands for commitments slackened as discounts on FHA and VA mortgages
rose further. The enlarged volume of FNMA's auction brought its
backlog of commitments to a record $3-1/2 billion by the end of
August.

Over the month of July, average contract interest rates on
new-home mortgages rose further in the primary market to exceed the
usury ceilings of 8 per cent or below prevailing in more than 20 States.
In the secondary home-mortgage market, yields and discounts edged higher.
As in other recent months, however, investment in home mortgages
continued unattractive relative to returns on new issues of high
grade corporate bonds.

In addition to curtailed loan availability, sharply higher
costs of mortgage credit--especially since last June--have increasingly
discouraged market transactions, and have forced recourse to other
credit arrangements such as loan assumptions and instalment sales
contracts. Even as early as the first quarter of 1969, a consi-
derably larger-than-usual share of all new mortgage commitments
written by reporting life insurance companies called for partial
amortization and balloon payments, in order to ease the burden of
high credit costs on income-property borrowers of all types.
During July, outstanding mortgage commitments at all S&Ls
and New York State mutual savings banks--chiefly for residential
loans on new and existing properties--edged down for the third conse-
cutive month. By the end of July, the dollar volume of their combined
commitment backlogs was about 5 per cent below the April peak. Mean-
while, the amount of current loans actually disbursed by the thrift
institutions was sharply reduced. Indications are that new mortgage
commitments approved by these same lenders in July were running at
a rate well below most earlier months of the year.
Life insurance companies. Cash flow available for invest-
ment by life insurance companies during the second quarter fell short
of earlier low projections. The most obvious drain in loanable
funds has come from policy loans, which were even larger than had
been anticipated.

* An increase in cash or policy loans represents a negative influence
on invested funds.
But perhaps an even more disquieting shortfall in fund flows
has come from the insurance side of the business, in the slowdown in
"ledger asset" flows. While not necessarily connoting a decrease in
insurance sales or coverage, this slowdown does reflect several
factors related to the attractive yields and credit stringency in the
money and capital markets. For example, there has been a reported
increase in the amount of benefits withdrawn in a lump sum by
beneficiaries rather than left with the companies for an annuity
payout; also, refunds of corporate pension premiums are no longer
just automatically applied to future premiums, but instead are
temporarily withdrawn by financial officers to purchase short-term
money instruments. Part of the shortfall in the ledger asset

III -16
category may also reflect factors peculiar to this second quarter;
with the surcharge, life companies may have made unexpectedly large
income tax payments in April and/or June.
It is noteworthy that sales of securities--long-term non-
Governments--a previously unplanned supply of funds, permitted
a smaller than planned decrease in cash position. Whether the
securities sold were bonds or stocks, publicly-held or direct place-
ments--and whether they were sold privately or on the open market--
is not known.
More recent reports from life insurance companies indicate
that pressures on loanable funds had intensified during July and
August. The net drain from policy loans continued to accelerate.
There has apparently been some use made of commercial bank lines of
credit, particularly as the weakening in the bond and stock markets
has made it necessary to take sizeable losses on most securities
sold from portfolios.

as it has become clear that even the earlier modest fund flow estimates
now require further trimming. Total commitments made during the second
quarter were somewhat lower than the reduced year--earlier pace, with
the cut-back fairly evenly divided between securities and mortgages
in general--but heavily concentrated on 1- to 4-family mortgages.

Corporate security and municipal bond markets. Stock prices
on the two major exchanges rose about 7-1/2 per cent in August from

yields advanced to new record levels. In both bond markets, investor
uncertainties appeared to play a major role in the latest run-up of
yields. (The increase in the corporate new-issue yield series is
somewhat understated for technical reasons.)

In late July and early August, some market participants had
begun to feel that perhaps yields had reached their highs, associated
with the long-awaited slowdown in economic expansion. Underwriters
priced bonds relatively aggressively, but some issues moved slowly
and a good portion of investor demand centered on small purchases of
individuals who were ostensibly shifting funds from thrift institutions
and the stock market. As dealer inventories mounted, several large
corporate syndicates were terminated, with upward yield adjustments as
high as 25 basis points.

III -19
Similar difficulties occurred in the tax-exempt market,
where the pressure of commercial bank run-offs of municipal bonds
was combined with continued concern regarding tax-exemption and fear
of greatly reduced demand by fire and casualty companies because of
hurricane losses. Most of the market pressures centered in the last
two weeks of August when bond yields rose about 35 basis points.
Reflecting the pressures in financial markets, corporate
long-term financing declined sharply in August. Flotations of corporate
bonds in the public market in August declined to an estimated $700
million, the lowest level this year; all of the $300 million decline
from the staff's projection a month ago reflects postponements or
cancellations of convertible bond offerings associated with the sharp
decline in stock prices in June and July. The weakness in stock
prices has also reduced new stock offerings to a level sharply below
the high second quarter pace.

In September, corporate security offerings are estimated to
rise a little more than seasonally. However, after the registration of
two large bond issues of tobacco firms, underwriters report no new
large offerings in the pipeline and a general willingness and ability
of corporations to await better market conditions. As shown in the
bottom panel of the table, the August-September estimated total security
offerings of corporations, including private placements, is expected
to average $1,825 million, or about one-fifth below the average pace
of the first 7 months of the year. If the level of capital outlays

III -21
now being projected by the Board's staff is realized, these security
estimates imply that the financing gap of corporations is widening
further in the third quarter. Consequently, there will have to be
continued sharp reductions in corporate holdings of liquid assets,
or perhaps some stepped-up borrowing at banks and in the commercial
paper market.

The marked increase in tax-exempt yields has further reduced
gross long-term tax-exempt offerings in August to about $850 million,
$200 million below July, and the same reduced volume is expected in
September. (Even this volume would not have been possible, however,--

As shown in the table, a pick-up in net short-term offerings
(exclusive of Federally-assisted issues) has more than offset the
August drop-off in long-term offerings. But even with the step-up in
short- term financing, total recent tax-exempt issues appear to be
about $200 million below the second quarter pace. Moreover, total
financing is certainly well below earlier planned levels. The first
Federal Reserve Board survey of borrowing plans of State and local
governments, described in Appendix A, suggests that the midyear plans
of these units was for gross long-term borrowing in the third quarter
of over $5 billion, or about $1.7 billion a month. The staff estimates
that financial conditions will now keep such offerings at only about
one-half the rate of these midyear plans; even including short-term
offerings, third quarter financing could still fall well below--
perhaps 20 per cent or more--the desired volume.
Government securities market. Yields on U.S. Government
securities generally declined in the first week after the last FOMC
meeting. Since then, however, rates on most issues have moved
irregularly higher and are now about 10 to 20 basis points above
their August 11 levels in the coupon sector and mostly 5 basis
points higher to 5 basis points lower in the bill area.

Around mid-August, the lower yields reflected a more hopeful
view of market participants that the economy might begin to cool
before the end of the year. At the same time, the market reacted
calmly to news of the French devaluation, and demand for bills by
foreign accounts added to the easing of rates in the short-term market.
More recently, however, the release of some key economic indicators
showing continued strength and remarks by Administration officials
indicating the need for a continued Government effort to combat
inflation contributed to a change in market expectations and to a
back-up of yields.
The market's technical condition remains strong, though,
as dealers have continued to move out acquisitions fairly quickly
and have maintained positions at relatively low levels. In the note
and bond sector, dealers' positions in securities maturing in 1 to 5

III -24
years have declined some $250 million on balance over the past
three weeks, while holdings of issues due in over 5 years are down
around $95 million. Some of these declines have reflected buying
in connection with investment demands from the forthcoming September
10 auction of Alaskan oil lease rights.
Part of the recent price declines in intermediate-term
issues was attributed to the offering of two Federal Agency issues
of over $200 million each in the 5-year area. Moreover, the market
has begun to focus its attention more on the need to refinance the
$5.6 billion of publicly-held October 1 maturities.
The bill area was affected recently by actual and anti-
cipated bank selling of the strip bills auctioned on August 20.
The Treasury sold a $2.1 billion strip, consisting of $300 million
additions to the weekly bills maturing between September 18 and
October 30. With the new supply of strip bills already overhanging
the market, rates adjusted higher in the last week of August when
three bill auctions were scheduled in a single week and as the market
began to look forward to the mid-September tax and dividend date.
Dealer bill positions increased in the 3-month and under
category as banks sold some of their awards of strip bills into the
Street, reaching a peak of over $700 million on August 26--compared
with net short holdings of about $100 million just before the auction
Most recently their holdings of short-dated bills totalled about $625

million. Positions in longer bills are down slightly since August 11,
despite positioning of bills from last week's three auctions.

Rate declines in the short-term Federal Agency market have
not been as large as those of most other short-term credit instruments,
reflecting the continued substantial supply of new offerings in the
Agency market. By mid-August short-term Agency rates were about 20
basis points below their July peaks, but by the month's end there was
evidence of an upturn in rates in response to a large FNMA issue and
market nervousness about September Agency demands, with the prospect
of a large Treasury refinancing also overhanging the market. The
August 13 1-year FHLB offering, for example, carried a yield of 8.20
per cent whereas the 14-month FNMA offering of August 28 yielded
8.30 per cent.

Other short-term credit markets. During August, rates on
private short-term credit instruments gradually backed off from the
highs reached in July despite the upward movement in Treasury bill
rates late in the month. Rates at the end of August were generally
25 to 50 basis points below their highest levels with 3-month
commercial paper, for example, offered at 8.25. Most recently,
however, the bankers' acceptance rate has again begun to increase.
The rise in commercial paper rates in July coincided with
the increase in the volume of commercial paper outstanding, which rose
by $937 million to a total of $27.6 billion. Dealer placed paper
actually declined in the month, but commercial paper placed directly
increased by $1,175 million during July, probably largely reflecting
issues of bank holding companies, which rose by $618 million in July
in further reflection of the squeeze on bank reserves and deposits.

Federal finance. The outlook for fiscal 1970 receipts and
outlays remains largely unchanged. Staff estimates of Budget receipts
at $195.9 billion are smaller than Administration figures because we are
projecting slower economic growth, while estimated outlays, at $192.9
billion, accept Administration forecasts. Defense Secretary Laird's
recent announcement that he intends to cut the 1970 defense budget
$3 billion to $77 billion reflects the Administration's determination
to offset anticipated overruns in "uncontrollable" programs with
corresponding cutbacks in other areas.

III -29
Since the Treasury cash balance at the end of August was only
$4.0 billion, the Treasury may not be able to maintain a positive balance
at the Federal Reserve through the mid-September low point without
borrowing by means of special certificates. The lowest ebb of the
total tax and loan and Federal Reserve balance should be about $1.3
billion on September 10-12, before strong tax receipts, especially
corporate, carry the balance to about $9.3 billion at the end of the
month.
In light of renewed upward yield pressures, attrition in
the $6.3 billion October debt refinancing ($5.6 billion of which is
publicly held) could well exceed $1 billion. The October 1 operation
is expected to be announced in mid-September, and since the financing
comes during the S&L quarterly reinvestment period, a regular rights
refunding would be helpful in minimizing the outflow from savings
institutions. Despite this important attrition, the Treasury will
probably not have to borrow new money until late October or early
November, when a substantial amount of cash will probably be raised
through tax anticipation bills.

THE ECONOMIC PICTURE IN DETAIL
International Developments
U.S. balance of payments. As the figures accumulate for the
third quarter there is scant indication of an early return to liquidity
deficits of the size that had become customary in the past few years.
In July the liquidity deficit was $1.2 billion (not seasonally adjusted),
and the partial weekly figures for August -- which in recent months have
been considerably off the mark -- point to another deficit of comparable
dimensions.
A very preliminary (and confidential) set of estimates of all
the balance of payments entries for the second quarter, and some revisions
of the first quarter accounts, suggests that although a considerable part
of the liquidity deficit -- and especially the rise from the first to the
second quarter -- can be ascribed to transitory factors, there has in
addition been a weakening of the basic position.
The transitory factors in the first quarter were some reversal
of the year-end inflows of corporate capital and possibly some outflows
of U.S. funds to the Euro-dollar market. In the second quarter outflows
of U.S. funds for D-mark speculation and investment in the Euro-dollar
market probably continued -- but the evidence now available, either from
statistics on capital flows or by implication from the size of the
unrecorded element in the balance-of-payments accounts, indicates that
this outflow probably did not exceed $1 billion for the quarter. An

IV -2
additional negative factor in the second quarter was the reversal of
"special" transactions with foreign governments. As rough orders of
magnitude, these transitory elements in the first half might have
accounted for $2-1/2 billion of the total liquidity deficit of $5-1/2
billion (not at annual rates).
The basic elements in the first half deficit were the extremely
feeble current account surplus (the second quarter annual rate is now
estimated at about $1 billion, which is lower than the $1.6 billion
rate now included in GNP estimates), larger outflows of U.S. private
capital, and lower inflows of foreign capital for long-term investment.
The trade balance is discussed below in some detail; the weakness in
the rest of the current account seems to reflect mainly a sizable increase
in interest payments to foreigners while income received on direct invest-
ments scored only a small increase. A major increase is reported to have
occurred in direct investment outflows -- especially to continental
Europe -- with the half-year total reaching nearly 80 per cent of the
total for 1968, even after deducting the use of proceeds of foreign
borrowings. Some of this outflow was probably anticipatory, however,
reflecting movements into D-mark assets and Euro-dollars.
In July and August there has probably been a continuation of
many of these elements, though some changes are occurring in individual
components. The July trade balance was still very small, and a further
reversal of "special" transactions worsened the liquidity balance by
about $100 million in both July and August. Other known negative elements

IV -3
in July were an increase in net purchase of new foreign bonds (mainly
Canadian), and a second month of liquidations of U.S. equity securities
by foreign investors, though net sales appear to have been less than
the $100 million reported for June. Also, much higher interest rates
are now being paid on the swollen amount of U.S. short-term debt to
foreigners.
A favorable development in July was a reduction of over $300
million in claims on foreigners reported by U.S. banks, in contrast to
sizable outflows in May and June. About $90 million of the July inflow
was from Japan and the remainder was spread over many countries.
The over-all balance in July on the official settlements basis
registered a surplus of $300 million, and differed from the liquidity
deficit mainly because of an increase of about $1 billion in liabilities
to foreign branches, as well as some increase in other liabilities to
private foreigners. Weekly data for August suggest a smaller increase
in private foreign accounts, so that a deficit on the official settlements
basis is likely.
U.S. foreign trade. The trade balance in July was a small
surplus (balance of payments basis) as exports fell less than imports.
For January-July combined, however, a small deficit was recorded
compared with a $1/2 billion surplus at an annual rate in the second
half of 1968. The rate of both exports and imports in the first seven
months changed very little from the rate in the last six months of last

IV -4
year; exports were about the same while imports increased by less than
2 per cent. These rates of change are far below those which occurred
from the first to the second half of 1968.
In view of the economic boom in Europe, Japan and other foreign
industrial countries, and the continued strength in output and consumption
here, the sluggishness in U.S. trade activity so far this year was
unexpected. The dock strike was probably partly responsible for this
slowdown. A further decline in shipments of agricultural products
because of weaker demand abroad was an additional factor in the case
of exports while supply limitations in Europe may have dampened imports.
Whether some goods not shipped because of the strike may eventually be
shipped is still uncertain. But most ports have been in full operation
for 4-5 months since the end of the strike so that the possibility of
further additional strike-related expansion in trade activity during
the remainder of the year seems remote.
A major element in the failure of exports to expand this year
has been the continuing decline in agricultural shipments. Exports of
such products had fallen slightly from the first to the second half of
1968, as P.L. 480 shipments of grains were sharply reduced. In January-
July, agricultural exports slumped by a further 10 per cent. Shipments
under the P.L. 480 programs this year have shown little change from the
second half of 1960. The most recent drop is partly the result of the
dock strike, and partly attributable to large world crops and the

IV -5
resultant weakening in demand for U.S. grains. More recently, cutting
of wheat prices by major world exporters to 15-20 per cent below the
minimum stipulated under the International Grains Arrangement has
increased the difficulty of marketing U.S. wheat.
Exports of nonagricultural products in January-July were at a
rate about 2 per cent higher than in the second half of 1968, but this is
considerably below the 8 per cent advance from the first to the second
half of last year. Particularly disappointing has been the failure of
machinery exports to respond to the economic boom in Europe where
capacity-utilization rates in manufacturing are close to the previous
peak rates of 1964-65.
Although total imports of most European countries continued to
expand in the first half of this year, U.S. exports to Western Europe
during this period fell by 6 per cent from the level in the second half
of 1968. Exports to Latin America and to other developing countries
also were lower. Shipments to Canada and Japan, however, increased by
9 and 5 per cent, respectively.
Exports of both agricultural and nonagricultural products to
continental Western Europe have declined so far this year. Agricultural
shipments (20 per cent of total exports to this area) fell sharply by
15 per cent; the drop in nonagricultural commodities was much less --
4 per cent. However, if deliveries of civilian aircraft, which rose
by over 25 per cent, are excluded, the decline in exports of other

IV -6
nonagricultural products would have been close to 10 per cent, compared
to a 20 per cent gain in such exports from the first to the second
half of last year.
The small over-all increase of 5 per cent in exports to Japan
this year included a very sharp drop -- 18 per cent -- in agricultural
products and a nearly equally large rise in shipments of nonagricultural
items.
The sizable expansion in exports to Canada this year was in
both agricultural and nonagricultural products. However, exports of
most nonagricultural products declined from last year, with the over-all
gain this year based on larger shipments of automobiles and of machinery
related to rising Canadian fixed investment outlays.
Imports in January-July were at an annual rate of $34.7 billion,
less than 2 per cent higher than the rate in the second half of 1968.
The major commodity categories, however, showed divergent movements.
Imports of nonfood consumer goods, other than automobiles, expanded by
nearly 15 per cent from the second half of 1960, an even greater rate of
advance than from the first to the second halves of last year. Imports
of cars in total also increased -- by 5 per cent; automobiles from Canada
expanded further but arrivals from other areas, principally Germany,
decreased appreciably.
Imports of foods and industrial materials in the first half of
the year were down from the rates in the second half of last year. Coffee
imports declined by nearly a third as inventories built up last year in

IV -7
anticipation of the dock strike were reduced to more normal levels this
year. Although domestic industrial output has accelerated this year,
imports of industrial materials have decreased. The value of steel
imports was about 20 per cent less than in the second half of 1968,
although import unit values (a rough indicator of price movements) rose
by 10 per cent. Supply stringency in Europe, particularly Germany and
Belgium, was the principal reason for the decline. Imports of capital
equipment continued to advance this year, keeping pace with the very
sharp expansion in domestic expenditures on producers' durable equipment.
Euro-dollar and exchange markets. The moderate and steady
decline in Euro-dollar rates that occurred during July and the first few
days of August was reversed following the devaluation of the French franc,
announced on August 8. The three-month deposit rate, for example,
declined from about 11-1/4 per cent per annum in early July to an average
of 10-1/4 per cent in the week ending August 6; since then, however, the
rate for three-month deposits has advanced steadily and averaged 11-1/4 per
cent in the week ending September 3. Rates in other maturities have
advanced similarly since early August.
The speculative atmosphere that developed in the exchange
markets following the devaluation of the French franc -- in combination
with the market's general uneasiness in advance of the forthcoming
elections in Germany -- probably put upward pressure on Euro-dollar
market yields. Beyond this influence, however, various other developments

IV -8
help to explain the recent firming of Euro-dollar rates: (1) U.S.
banks' borrowings of Euro-dollars through their foreign branches
advanced (net) by $475 million in the three weeks ending August 27,
in contrast to a net decline of about $85 million in such borrowings
during the three previous weeks (July 16 to August 6). (2) At the
same time, conditions in most major European money markets appear to
have remained tight, by recent standards, throughout August. The
German money market, for example, remained quite illiquid and the
Bundesbank -- even though offering swaps at rates well below the rate
obtainable in the private forward market -- took in $400 million more
from maturing forward contracts than it sold under newly contracted
swaps. The Bank of Italy, in mid-August, raised its basic discount
rate by 1/2 per cent to 4 per cent and Italian banks, apparently in
response to tighter domestic credit market conditions, reduced their
holdings of foreign currency assets covered by swaps with the Italian
authorities by $65 million in August. The Swiss money market has
remained tight with very short-term funds recently quoted at 6 to 7 per
cent per annum, or higher. Short-term money rates in France have only
recently moved to below 9 per cent per annum. Dutch and Belgian money
markets remained firm in August while short-term rates in Canada advanced
further and interest rates in Britain remained at recent historic highs.

Devaluation of the French franc on August 8 unsettled foreign
exchange markets considerably although no massive flows of funds were
involved. Sterling, the Belgian franc and the Italian lira came under
heavy selling pressure the week following the change in the French franc
parity, and the German mark, Swiss franc and Dutch guilder were in strong
demand. The Bank of England lost $500 million during the week, while
the National Bank of Belgium sold $250 million and the Bank of Italy,
$130 million. The Bundesbank, on the other hand, purchased about $500
million. (During the same week it swapped out about $340 million.)
The heavy sales of sterling were at least partly associated with
the fact that the U.K. trade data for July, announced the week following
the French franc devaluation,were disappointing. The Belgian franc came(4)

under speculative selling as a result of the widespread view that that
currency would have to follow the French franc in devaluation because
of the close economic and financial ties between Belgium and France.
While the Belgian current account is in approximate equilibrium in
contrast to that of Frence, outflows of capital from general currency
uncertainty and interest rate differentials have put pressure on Belgian
reserves. The heavy sales of Italian lire largely reflected purchases of
Swiss francs and German marks by Italian residents with outstanding
liabilities in these currencies.
Since mid-August foreign exchange activity has been much
reduced and exchange rates have moved narrowly. Over-all demand for
sterling has remained quite weak although the Bank of England was able
to purchase small amounts of dollars at times whenthe market would
rebound from a deeply oversold position. The discount on 3-month
forward sterling widened to over 9 per cent per annum at one point and
has remained generally above 8 per cent. This weakness reflects
considerable pessimism over sterling, which seems to have grown in
the four weeks since the French franc devaluation. The Bank of England's
net market losses in August totalled $500 million, $50 million of which
was offset by spot dollar purchases in conjunction with swap transactions.
The remaining $450 million was partly financed by increased swap drawings
on the System, additional borrowings from a European central bank, and
advance military offset payments by the Germans.

IV -11
The Belgian National Bank was able to recoup later in August
only about $30 million of its earlier $250 million loss as the market
for francs continued quite weak. On September 2 the System swap facility
with the Belgian National Bank was increased from $300 million to $500
million. The Bank of Italy recouped about $35 million late in August,
leaving its net monthly loss at about $100 million.
Demand for the French franc has been firm at its new parity and
the Bank of France has been able to purchase around $250 million since
devaluation. Demand for the German mark -- although firm -- has not
prompted any Bundesbank market purchases of dollars since mid-August.
That bank's net spot dollar purchases in August were $215 million and it
had receipts from maturing swap contracts of about $785 million; this
$1,000 million of receipts was partly offset by swap dollar sales totalling
$380 million, leaving an increase in its reserves of over $600 million
for the month.

IV -12
The Devaluation of the French franc
The continuing overheating of the French economy and the large
current account deficit--this year averaging $150 million a month--coupled
with rapidly declining reserves lead to the Pompidou Government's decision
to devalue the franc by 11.1 per cent on August 8. Although there had
been speculation that devaluation was unavoidable and would possibly
be linked to other parity changes, particularly a revaluation of the
German mark, the timing of the French move was unexpected.
By early August, French official reserves, net of assistance,
were down to less than $1.5 billion. Very wide discounts on forward
francs enabled a part of foreign trade to be financed at a rate substantially
below the official parity and devaluation was in part a recognition of
market realities. Since devaluation, French reserves have increased
modestly, perhaps by $250 million, because of a favorable shift in
leads and lags, and some capital reflow.
Post-devaluation information does not suggest that French
exporters will significantly lower their prices. Foreign currency
prices of France's major exports will remain largely unchanged, with the
increase in franc profits stemming from devaluation being absorbed by
exporters, probably as insurance against higher costs resulting from
wage increases which are likely to be granted in the fall.
Devaluation ended a period of suspense, but did not solve the
basic problems of the French economy. The decision to devalue came at
a time when the economy was operating nearly at full capacity, making it

IV -13
difficult to increase output. Moreover, factor mobility in France is
very low and considerable time will elapse before sufficient resources
can be shifted to production for export and for import substitution.
Longer-range problems of rationalization of the industrial sector remain
and are to some degree in conflict with the short-run need for retrenchment.
The 1967 British experience shows the need for backing devalua-
tion immediately with an austerity program. However, the French Government
deferred announcing details of new restraining measures until this month.
The French authorities are trying to steer a narrow course between a
possible renewal of social unrest and a dissipation of devaluation
benefits through excessive cost and price rises. In the meantime, a
general--but reportedly not fully effective--price freeze is in force
until September 15, and some restraining measures have been announced.
Medium-term interest rates on loans granted by public lending entities were
raised to discourage investment, and installment-buying terms were tightened
for the next 5 months in an effort to cut down on imports of consumer
durables and make an additional part of production available for exports.
It is uncertain if the Government is prepared to take restrictive
measures that will curb domestic demand sufficiently to restore equilibrium
to the current account. Moreover, wage settlements later this year may
result in excessive cost push on prices. In addition, the French
economy needs a period of calm on the international markets and exchange
controls--the major inhibitor against capital reflows--cannot be lifted until
the uncertainty on the DM parity is resolved. At best, the French adjustment
process will be gradual and lengthy.

IV -14
To shore up reserves during the transition period the French
government has applied for a stand-by arrangement of $985 million from
the IMF; it is expected that $500 million of this sum will be drawn
within about 30 days, and the remainder early in 1970. In addition,
standby swap assistance available to the Bank of France still amounts to
$1.6 billion. This is composed of the currently unused $1 billion facility
with the System and newly established additional facilities of $400 million
from the other EEC countries and $200 million from the BIS. Short-term
assistance drawings by the Bank of France now total $1.5 billion, with
published reserves amounting to about $3.8 billion. The Bank of France
also has some undisclosed, but sizable, dollar swaps with French commercial
banks.

Trade developments in Europe, Canada and Japan
Despite some deceleration in the rate of increase, foreign
trade of the European OECD countries continued to grow at a rapid pace
during the first half. Exports rose by 12 per cent and imports by 14 per
cent (annual rates) from the second half of 1968 to the first half of 1969.
The annual rates of increase for exports and imports between the first and
second halves of last year were 23 per cent and 20 per cent, respectively,

The deceleration in the growth of exports is traceable in part
to an 8 per cent decline in shipments to the United States between the
last half of 1968 and the first half of 1969. A reduction in European
steel exports to the United States, resulting primarily from tight capacity
conditions in Europe, accounted for most of the decline. The U.S. dock
strike in the first part of the year also contributed to the decrease both
through delayed shipments and cancelled orders.
European exports to other major areas did not decline, but the
rates of increase in exports to Japan and the less developed countries
fell sharply. Reflecting continued boom conditions in Europe, intra-OECD

European trade advanced at the very high annual rate of about 20 per cent,
down only slightly from the 24 per cent annual rate of increase between
the two halves of 1968. European shipments to Canada, where economic
expansion was very rapid late last year and early this year, increased
at an annual rate of 20 per cent over the second semester of 1968.
The deceleration in Europe's import growth was largely attributable
to a 6 per cent decline in shipments to Europe from the United States from
the second half of 1968 to the first half of 1969. The dock strike was
also an important factor in this decrease, but inflationary price advances
in the U.S. may also have discouraged purchases.
Imports from non-OECD countries rose, but at a slower rate,
a development probably reflecting a shift in demand, as the boom in
Europe wears on, from raw materials to manufactured goods. Imports from
Japan and Canada rose at about the same rate in the first half as they had
in the second half last year.
Elsewhere in the OECD, Japanese exports rose at an annual rate
of 27 per cent from second half 1958 to first half 1969, compared to a
21 per cent annual rate rise between the first and second halves of last
year. Imports rose by only 4 per cent between the last semester of 1968
and the first of 1969. In Canada, imports grew more rapidly than exports
from the second half of 1968 to the first half of this year, though the
government's anti-inflation program succeeded in decreasing imports in
the second quarter. Exports followed a similar pattern, growing in the

IV -18
early part of the first half and declining thereafter. Exports
were adversely affected by strikes and the world wheat surplus.
Trade developments in OECD countries thus far this year have
contributed little to rectifying payments imbalances. Among countries
in overall balance of payments surplus, Italy and Japan experienced an
improvement in the trade balance and Germany's trade surplus, after a
temporary reduction in the first quarter, surged again in the spring.
Both in Germany and Japan in recent months trade balance movements have
run counter to cyclical developments. In Japan, moreover, the trade
surplus widened after the first quarter despite an acceleration in
economic activity, which prompted the Bank of Japan to increase the
discount rate from 5.84 to 6.25 per cent on September 1. Among countries
in overall deficit, only the U.K. has recently shown some narrowing of
the trade deficit.
The economic boom is likely to continue in Continental Europe
well into 1970--except, possibly in France, where restraint measures are
being adopted following the devaluation of the franc. Generally buoyant
economic activity in Europe should expand intra-European trade and attract
imports from outside Europe as well.
Developments in the trade of individual countries were as
follows:
Germany's swollen trade surplus shrank significantly from the
fourth to the first quarter, but only in reaction to adjustments in the
fourth quarter when traders had acted in anticipation of changes in

IV -19
border taxes. These changes were designed to reduce the price of imports
into Germany and make German goods more expensive to foreign buyers.
Exports again surged in April-July, and import growth, though
still rapid, retreated to less spectacular rates after the first quarter.
As a result, the German trade surplus almost doubled from the first to
the second quarter. For the year as a whole the German trade surplus is
expected to total about $4 billion. This is not a great deal less than
the $4.4 billion surplus in the recession year of 1967 and indicates the
inadequacy of cyclical forces in eroding the trade surplus.
The commodity composition of German trade changed in the first
half, as finished goods and foodstuffs gained in relative importance in
both exports and imports at the expense of raw materials and semi-finished
goods. Data on orders indicate that this trend will continue for exports.
In connection with the change in the commodity composition of
German import demand, there was a decline in the relative importance of
the less developed countries as suppliers of Germany and a corresponding
gain in the market share of such countries as France, the Netherlands
and the United States.
On the export side, demand from industrial countries was the
prime stimulus to growth from the fourth quarter of 1968 to the second
quarter of 1969.
Though quarterly changes in trade reflect the severe distortions
caused by the border tax changes and the U.S. dock strike, both exports
and imports are rising at an annual rate of about 17 per cent.

IV -20
French imports rose very rapidly during the first seven months
of 1969, averaging 10 per cent more a month than in August-December.
Imports were stimulated both by the high level of economic activity in
France and by speculative buying in anticipation of devaluation. Imports
of steel were notably higher. French exports also increased this year,
but at a slower rate than imports. The composition of French exports
has altered somewhat, with shipments of agricultural goods increasing
more rapidly than those of manufactured goods. There was an especially
sharp rise in exports of wheat and wheat products to Germany.
French trade developments in coming months largely depend on
the effects of the devaluation. Dramatic changes seem unlikely. Allowing
for substantial buying of French goods with discounted francsbefore the
devaluation, the effective parity change in August was less than 11.1 per
cent. Much of the French economy is operating at full capacity, making
rapid expansion of exports virtually impossible in the near future.
Moreover, devaluation will increase the pressure for wage boosts, which
could lead to cost increases nullifying the price advantage stemming
from the new franc parity. Even without wage rises, the profit squeeze
in recent months makes unlikely any major reduction in foreign currency
prices of French goods.
However, restraints on the domestic economy have already been
imposed and more are expected soon. This, coupled with an end to anticipatory
import buying, could significantly reduce the rate of growth of imports,
although the French current account deficit this year may reach $1.5 billion.

IV -21
In Italy, the trade deficit of the second half gave way to a
surplus in the first half, as export growth speeded up slightly, while
the rate of import expansion fell.
Italian exports are on a strong upward trend. The annual rate
of growth since early 1968 has been about 25 per cent, resulting in a
sizable increase in Italy's market share. For example, Italian exports
to other OECD countries have increased at about twice the rate at which
total imports of these countries have increased.
Italian imports are also rising, though less steeply than exports.
The strength of import demand is primarily the result of the expansion
of economic activity. Growth sharply accelerated in the last few months
of 1968 and apparently continues to be rapid this year. The faster pace
of expansion reflects the fiscal measures adopted last year to stimulate
private investment, as well as the success of the monetary authorities
thus far this year in preventing rises in interest rates.
Recent restraint measures are not expected to significantly
cool the current Italian economic boom, so that the prospects are good
for continued vigorous import demand.
Britain's trade deficit--on a balance of payments basis, that
is, with both exports and imports f.o.b.declined by about $125 million
from the second half of 1968 to the first half of 1969, totaling about
$550 million in January-June. (The latter figure does not take into
account the under-recording of exports which, the government announced

IV -22
last spring, had occurred since 1963 at about $25 million a month.)
The decrease in the trade deficit, combined with a reduction in payments
for U.S. military aircraft and a rise in net earnings from invisibles,
has yielded a small surplus on current account thus far in 1969.
Much of the improvement in the trade deficit has occurred since
April. In January, the deficit was sharply reduced to $29 million, but
for the next three months averaged $140 million. In May-July, however,
the average was reduced to about $60 million, in spite of an unfavorable
turn in the terms of trade in recent months. From the first to the second
quarter, export prices remained unchanged while import prices rose by
about 1.5 per cent. During the same interval, export volume increased
by 5 per cent, compared to only a 2 per cent rise in imports.
The improvement in Britain's trade position occurred despite a
sharp 11 per cent decline this year in U.K. exports to the United States--
which buys more British goods than any other country. Total British
exports nevertheless rose by 3.4 per cent, down sharply from the 8.8 per
cent increase from the first to the second half of 1968. Continued strong
demand from Western Europe coupled with a surge in exports to the sterling
area and Canada helped offset the drop in shipments to the U.S. Imports
between the two halves increased by a modest 1.7 per cent, compared to
a 2.9 per cent rise between the first and second halves of last year.
The slow growth in imports reflected the damping influences of the
imposition of the import deposit scheme at the end of November and the
reduction in aggregate output during the first quarter of 1969.

IV -23
The outlook is for continued rapid growth in exports and probably
for an increased rate of growth in imports. There is a substantial
accumulation of orders from abroad for British machinery and transport
equipment. Imports are likely to expand after--or if--the import deposit
scheme expires in November and because of the expansion in economic activity
which began after the first quarter dip.
Exports of the Netherlands rose by 11 per cent from the second
half of 1968 to the first half of 1969, while imports rose by 8 per cent.
The corresponding rates of increase between the first two halves of 1968
were 14 and 11 per cent. Most of the increase in exports and imports was
accounted for by Dutch transactions with other members of the Common Market.
The strength of exports is attributable to the high levels of demand among
the Netherlands' main trading partners and to substantial productivity
gains in Dutch export industries. The productivity increases have helped
prevent domestic inflation from impairing the competitive position of
Dutch exports.
Exports of Belgium-Luxembourg have continued to grow very rapidly,
helping to underpin the strong expansion of economic activity there.
Shipments abroad in the first five months of 1969 were 18 per cent higher
than they had been in January-May 1968. The largest increases have been
in shipments to other Common Market countries, in particular, to France
and Germany.

IV -24
Imports have also risen rapidly and were over 16 per cent
higher in January-May than in the same period a year ago. Although a
number of restrictive monetary and fiscal measures have been adopted in
the last several months, there is little prospect for a slackening of
Belgian economic activity--and import demand--this year.
Canada's trade surplus declined for the second consecutive half
in January-June, as rapid export growth was outstripped by rising imports.
In the first half, however, there was an abrupt turn-around for both
exports and imports, as steep increases during the first part of the
period gave way to declines in the second part. The decrease in exports
was very sharp, reflecting the world wheat surplus and cutbacks in shipments
of iron ore because of strikes in that industry in May and June.
The decrease in imports, which was much more moderate than for
exports, resulted in part from the government's anti-inflationary measures,
though other factors also played a part. Imports, however, are likely to
increase at a 10 per cent annual rate in the second half over the first.
Renewed growth in exports is also likely, but at a modest 3 per
cent annual rate this semester. The glut in world wheat markets, strike-
induced reductions in nickel ore output, and an easing of demand from
the United States will affect Canada's exports. The trade surplus for 1969
as a whole is likely to decline substantially.

APPENDIX A: STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT BORROWING ANTICIPATIONS*
The first survey of State and Local Government Borrowing
Anticipations by the Federal Reserve Board indicates that these governments
are planning gross long-term borrowing of approximately $19 billion in
fiscal year 1970 (July 1969 to June 1970). Over $15 billion of the total
represents debt issues already authorized by bond election or legislative
approval. The remaining $4 billion is the estimated amount of debt not
yet authorized that will likely be approved and could come to market if
conditions were favorable.
The $19 billion figure is based on the anticipations of a sample
1/of 4,100 respondent units as of mid-year 1969. Implicit in these plans
are not only the experiences resulting from the stringent capital market
conditions of the first half of 1969, but also interest-rate expectations
for the coming four quarters. Many respondents, particularly those from
larger units, volunterred that their plans were contingent upon (1) an
easing of municipal bond yields or (2) a lifting of legal ceilings on
interest rates. Further deterioration of conditions in the municipal bond
market in the past few weeks clearly will reduce actual borrowing to well
below what borrowers anticipated as of mid-1969 for the third quarter of
this year.
1/ On a unit basis, response was about 90 per cent. However, in terms
of the largest units and heaviest borrowers, it is much higher than
this. While the analysis of response is not yet completed, it appears
that all the State government units of any significant size were
reached. Among the local units, those not responding represent only
a small share of potential borrowing. Even after application of the
blow-up factors, it is unlikely that an adjustment for nonresponse
would increase the over-all estimates by more than 3 or 5 per cent,
or $500 million to $1.0 billion for the year.

60 per cent of the dollar volume of issues have been approved in

of these elections will not be held at all or on time, and (2) respond
ents may not have allowed enough time for the developing of issues
after the approval at bond election (i.e., treated the election and
sale as occurring in the same quarter). Altogether, a 50 per cent
inclusion of unauthorized borrowing is a reasonable approximation.
Experience with the panel should improve our ability to weight the
unauthorized debt and to predict in this area.

this lumpiness. First, there is a substantial overhang of debt that
has been postponed over the past year and that will be brought to market
as soon as conditions permit. Second, there will be movement of
unauthorized issues into the authorized category as issues are approved
over the course of the year. Third, plans naturally will be more vaguely
held for the last half of the fiscal year. It is to be expected that some
borrowing plans are just now being initiated that may be executed by the
end of the fiscal year.

Fiscal Year
1/ Published postponements were $1.5 billion for the 10 months ending
mid-1969. But results of the 1966 State and local borrowing survey
suggested that the published sources pick up only about half of the
actual delays and reductions in long-term borrowings. Consequently,
the staff estimates that about $3 billion of issues were postponed
or reduced from September 1968 through June 1969. Allowance must be
made for a siphoning off of perhaps a third of these postponements
through later comebacks, alternative financing arrangements, or pro-
ject cancellations. But it is likely that $2 billion or so of the
authorized sales scheduled (as of mid-1969) for the last two quarters
of 1969 represents either issues that were not sold earlier as
planned or that were sold as short-term notes and will be in need of
refunding.-3-

CONFIDENTIAL (FR)
Comparison With Earlier Periods and Recent Developments
As is shown in Figure 1, the estimated borrowing for fiscal
year 1970 is somewhat above longer-term trends--trends which were breached
by the stringent market conditions of fiscal 1969. Reported gross
borrowing for fiscal year 1969 equalled $15.5 billion. As may be seen
in Table 2, the annual rate of borrowing dropped precipitously over the
past fiscal year period, from approximately $18 billion in the second
half of 1968 to $13 billion in the first half of 1969. To accomplish an
anticipated $19 billion in long-term borrowing in fiscal 1970, therefore,
would require a dramatic upsurge in municipal bond sales for the next
three quarters. Indeed, the implied increase in such sales for the remaining
three quarters of fiscal 1970 over the volume sold in the first half of
calendar 1969 is approximately 50 per cent.

High interest rates and generally stringent market conditions
already have reduced actual bond offerings to well below the planned levels
for the third quarter of 1969. It now appears that actual long-term
bond sales will not exceed $2.8 billion for the third quarter or over
$2 billion below the planned levels indicated by the survey. Most of
these delayed issues will probably be shifted to subsequent quarters and
can be expected to come to market as soon as monetary pressures subside.
This continued buildup of unsatisfied borrowing demand and the accumulating
overhang of postponed issues will tend to reduce some current expenditure

nature and extent of these impacts as well as revisions in future borrow-
ing plans will be the subject of quarterly follow-up surveys of units in

the panel planning to borrow.
Borrowing by Type of Government
Table 3 gives the estimated anticipated borrowing levels of
State and local governments by type of units. State government borrowing
constitutes about one-third of the planned total and the bulk of this has
already been authorized. Because of the relative high proportion of planned
amounts not yet authorized, the estimates for local governments (especially
special districts and school districts) are more uncertain. The last column
presents the actual borrowing figures for those units in fiscal 1968 as
reported by the IBA. Although there are some problems of classification
1/ The quarterly follow-up surveys (at the end of September, December,
and March) will give a clear picture on (1) the amount postponed,
(2) the revised borrowing plans, and (3) the consequences of the
postponement for alternative financing and for expenditures. Item (2)
will be used to make a rolling revision of planned borrowing for the
remainder of the year.

CONFIDENTIAL (FR)
making the figures not completely comparable, it would appear that
State governments are maintaining their long-term borrowing expectations
in line with recent experience while local units are hoping for a sub-
stantial increase in borrowing.

1/ The State data represents a 100 per cent canvass and has not been
blown up. The very largest local units, approximately 1,000 were
also canvassed. The remainder of the local unit data was based on a
sample of approximately 3,000 units which were subsequently blown up
to form univere estimates. The average blow-up factor (including
the large-unit canvass) was 1.40 for cities and towns, 1.21 for
counties, 1.45 for special districts, and 2.90 for school districts.
Overall, the blown-up figures were 1.39 times the reported amounts
(including State and local units in the 100 per cent canvass).
Adjustments for local unit nonresponse should increase the final
figures only fractionally (circa 5 per cent) when it is completed.
