SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK
Outlook for Economic Activity
While expansion of GNP in the third quarter is apparently
somewhat greater than in the preceding quarter, there have been con-
tinued signs of easing in indicators of economic activity and growth
is expected to moderate in the fourth quarter. Industrial production
dipped in August and is expected to show little or no improvement in
September. New and unfilled orders for machinery and equipment have
declined. Housing starts have already fallen substantially this year,
and are expected to drop further in coming months. Retail sales have
continued sluggish despite higher auto sales in September.
The large gain in current dollar GNP now estimated for the
third quarter reflects a greater increase in inventory accumulation than
had earlier been anticipated and also the sizable Federal pay raise.
Despite the relatively large rise in disposable income in the third
quarter, growth in consumer expenditures moderated and the saving rate
rose substantially. The slowing in consumer spending would seem to
be in line with the recent Michigan survey, which indicated a sharp
decline in its index of consumer sentiment.
The major sectors accounting for the relative strength in GNP
growth last quarter seem likely to provide less stimulation to the economy
in the current and the next few quarters. Federal government purchases
are expected to decline as defense expenditures resume their downward

I 2
trend. While inventory investment will probably continue large this
quarter because of involuntary stock building, the rate of accumulation
is not expected to be any greater than last quarter. Declines in new
orders for machinery and equipment and likely declines in profits suggest
that gains in business fixed investment are not expected to continue at
their recent pace in coming quarters and may fall short of the increases
forecast by the latest private surveys. Finally, reduced availability
of funds for mortgage lending should act to curtail new housing starts
further.
If final sales slow as much as we anticipate, some downward
adjustment in the rate of inventory accumulation should be under way
by the turn of the year. With final demands sluggish and an inventory
adjustment under way, no further growth in real GNP is expected in the
first half of 1970. This outlook assumes that the surcharge will be
retained at 5 per cent and that the investment tax credit will be repealed.
Outlook for resource use and prices
The rate of capacity utilization in manufacturing is estimated
to have declined in the third quarter. With production projected to in-
crease only a little further in the current quarter and to decline some-
what in the first half of next year, it appears likely that the capacity
utilization rate will fall appreciably further by mid-1970.
Demand for labor is showing some signs of abating. Growth in
nonfarm employment has slowed in recent months, and the manufacturing work-
week has come down a little. With expansion in real GNP projected to

I-3
slow in the current quarter and to halt in the first half of next year,
we are expecting little, if any, further increase in employment after
year-end. The unemployment rate is likely to edge up in the fourth
quarter, and to rise further in the first half of next year.
The heavy calendar of contract negotiations scheduled for the
first half of 1970--in contrast to the light schedule this year--will be
a factor exerting upward pressure on wage rates. Nevertheless, we
anticipate some slowing in the upward pace of average hourly earnings, as
weakening demand for labor leads to some reduction in the average work-
week and in overtime pay.
Average prices of industrial commodities have continued to
increase fairly rapidly, with rising labor and materials costs putting
pressure on prices of finished goods. But with demands weakening and
resources in more ample supply, prices of industrial commodities over
the next three quarters are unlikely to continue to rise as rapidly as
over the past year.
Some easing of the rapid advance in consumer prices is also
in prospect. Sluggish demands are likely to exert a slowing influence
on prices of nonfood commodities. With respect to food, the extra-
ordinarily sharp rise in meat prices from August 1968 to August 1969 is
most unlikely to be approached. Prices of services will generally
continue to rise rapidly, but any leveling off of the rise in mortgage
interest rates would contribute to a slower increase in the overall
index.

I-4
Prospective supplies of funds
Recent increases in interest rates have developed in large
measure because lendable funds available from banks and other types
of financial intermediaries have become severely limited by the
cumulative effects of monetary restraint. Given no change in pre-
vailing tight money market conditions or existing regulatory rate
ceilings at depositary institutions, there appears to be little relief
in sightwith respect to these supply constraints. Depositary-type
institutions can be expected to experience continued heavy pressures
on their savings flows during the fourth quarter. Funds available
from life insurance companies should continue to be restricted by
policy loan increases and the slowing of repayment flows. And even
pension funds, where flows are more assured, may continue to show
considerable caution in committing funds to long-term markets until
they see clearer evidence of slower economic activity and a peaking
in interest rates.
Nonbank thrift institutions are expected to experience sizable
net losses of savings during the current October reinvestment period.
Thereafter, industry spokesmen anticipate little if any net resumption
of seasonal inflows over the remaining weeks of the quarter. And they
fear that net savings attrition in January will again become heavy,
following year-end interest crediting. In short, thrift institutions
are likely to have to continue cutting into their reduced liquidity,
to step-up borrowing at Federal Home Loan and commercial banks, and to

I-5
cut back still further on their new mortgage loan commitments. This
outlook for the savings industry and, in consequence, the mortgage
market is buttressed by results of the recent Federal Reserve and
Federal Home Loan Banks survey of selected mortgage lenders.
At commercial banks, also, net attrition in time and savings
accounts is expected to continue during the fourth quarter. Some
moderation in the volume of CD attrition may develop as the level of
outstandings approaches hard core levels. Also, a few major banks
have recently shown a willingness to bid for foreign official CD's
at rates not far below those available on Euro-dollars. But attrition
in consumer-type time and savings deposits will be resumed in
October--following quarterly interest crediting--and weakness in these
accounts is likely to persist over the rest of the year.
Banks have reduced their reliance on nondeposit sources of
funds recently. Their future attitudes toward such funds will un-
doubtedly be considerably influenced by the strength of fall loan
demands.
Demands for funds
With no relief in sight for institutional lenders, pressures
on mortgage markets are likely to continue in the months ahead and lead
to further general advances in mortgage interest rates. Although there
has been some evidence that rising interest rates and building costs
have begun to limit current demands for housing, effective demands for

I-6
mortgage funds reportedly still greatly exceed supplies. In these
circumstances FNMA and FHLBB can be expected to continue their efforts
to support the mortgage market. Taken together their combined demands
for net new money may total as much as $2.5 billion during the fourth
quarter.
Business takings of external funds in the fourth quarter
would seem more likely to expand than to contract from recent levels.
In the third quarter reduced bank credit availability and high cor-
porate bond yields apparently led business corporations to meet a
sizable share of their needs for funds through liquidation of assets.
While some further draw down of liquid assets can probably also be
expected into the fall, the large prospective gap between corporate
uses and internal sources suggests that businesses may attempt to
make more active use of credit lines at banks in addition to maintain-
ing a relatively heavy volume of borrowing in capital markets.
Limitations imposed by inflexible rate ceilings have sharply
reduced the effective demands of State and local governments on capital
markets over the past two months. In fact, the extremely small
calendar of offerings in September caused municipal yields to recede
from their earlier highs. Yields are not expected to decline sufficiently
further, however, to permit any large increase in municipal bond volume,
since any tendency to step-up demand would quickly reassert upward
pressures on yields. A firm Congressional assurance that the tax
exempt status of municipal bonds would remain unchanged would, of
course, help to moderate these pressures.

I -7
If recent tendencies evident in Federal receipts and outlays
should persist, Treasury cash needs over the fall months might be as
much as $1 billion larger than the $5 billion previously indicated by
Treasury spokesmen. This need would most likely be met in the bill
area, and there would be no further refinancing requirements.
Given the prospective continuing constraints on the supply
of lendable funds from financial intermediaries, prospective demands
for funds suggest that intermediate- and long-term interest rates may
remain under upward pressure in the period immediately ahead. However,
some part of prospective supply-demand developments has undoubtedly
already been discounted by recent rate advances, and longer-term
interest rates may peak out as the fourth quarter progresses, assum-
ing enough substantiating evidence of an economic slowdown.
Balance of payments outlook
If an upward revaluation of the German mark emerges from the
present situation, it may prove more significant in paving the way
psychologically and politically for later actions by Germany and other
surplus countries to adjust their payments positions than for any early
effects--apart from checking or reversing the recent speculative flows
of funds. In the short run the degree of stimulus a mark revaluation
will give German imports, and its damping effect on German exports,
will depend not only on the magnitude of the rate change, which may be
small, but also on whether offsetting border tax changes are made, on

I-8
whether German monetary policy is then tightened a few more notches
to help bring Germany's domestic boom under better control, and on
whether German producers adjust their DM prices and accept a shrink-
age of present wide profit margins. Moreover, any reduction in the
German trade surplus will benefit primarily the trade balances of
other countries within continental Europe, Germany's major trade
partners.
With or without a mark revaluation in the near future, a
moderate trend of improvement in the U.S. trade balance is probably
beginning to emerge. Both exports and imports in August were above
expected levels. Imports, however, may ease off in the course of the
next six months if present projections of U.S. demand for materials
and for inventories in general prove valid. Exports, on the other
hand, will be sustained--and may advance appreciably from 1969 to 1970,
even though less rapidly than over the past two years--if demand in
continental Europe, in Japan, and in many of the less industrialized
countries holds up as we expect it will. In Germany the margin of
labor force expansibility--mainly with foreign labor--has already be-
come narrower than in the previous peak year 1965, and the pressures
of rising disposable income are beginning to push the German price
level up perceptibly. A mark revaluation would help relieve the in-
flationary pressures within the country--which, of course, is its main
virtue in German domestic political thinking--but even with that help

I-9
the end of the present boom in Germany will still be many months away,
at the least.
Despite the expected improvement in the U.S. export surplus,
it is highly probable that the overall balance of payments, exclusive
of flows to and from the Euro-dollar market and speculative flows to
or from other currencies, will still be severely in deficit in the
next several quarters. Though the July-August statistics support a
belief that some inflows of foreign capital to the U.S. stock market
may still be obtained, and though a pick-up in European flotations of
securities by U.S. corporations may be in the offing, an offsetting
tendency for U.S. direct investment outflows to grow is indicated
both by companies' plans for plant and equipment expenditures abroad
and by the way the Administration seems to be leaning toward easing
the OFDI controls.
Little net change has occurred since July in the outstanding
liabilities of U.S. banks to their foreign branches. The official
settlements balance is therefore tending to come into line with the
liquidity balance. The deficit in August and September was large on
either basis, apparently averaging more than half a billion dollars
a month. In coming quarters the liquidity balance may show some im-
provement. Because some net repayment of Euro-dollar borrowings by
U.S. banks may occur, continuation of very large deficits on the
official settlements basis is not unlikely.

THE ECONOMIC PICTURE IN DETAIL
Domestic Nonfinancial Scene
Gross national product. Recent developments lend support to
our projections of a further easing of final demands and GNP growth in
the next several quarters. The sharp decline in construction activity
since last spring has begun to affect supplier industries, as well as
to reduce demands for appliances and furniture. Consumer demand for
goods in general has shown little or no growth in recent months. In
addition, Federal purchases of defense goods are being cut further and
new orders for machinery and equipment have turned down. Growth of
industrial production has leveled off, but there are signs, neverthe-
less, of growing imbalances between output and consumption with an
associated increase in inventory accumulation. However, there are also
indications of some further rise in business fixed investment in the
next few quarters, and although employment growth has slowed, income
flows are still large and inflationary pressures continue strong.
Gross national product in the third quarter is expected to
increase by $17 billion, $1 billion more than in the second quarter,
and slightly more than we had anticipated last month. However, final
demands appear to be weaker than we had earlier thought. Growth in
private final sales is expected to be $5 billion less than in the second
quarter, although there was some offset from a rise in Government pur-
chases as a result of the Federal pay raise in July. However, a larger
rise in inventory accumulation is estimated to have added about $3
billion to GNP growth.

II -2
Some of this additional inventory accumulation appears to
have been involuntary. Consumer demand has been perceptibly weaker in
the past few months, despite an exceptionally large increase in dispos-
able income, reflecting the Federal pay raise and the completion of
payments in the second quarter on 1968 income tax liabilities. This
suggests an increase in the saving rate to about 6.7 per cent from 5.3
per cent in the second quarter--an unusually sharp change. Retail sales
have shown little or no increase recently and in real terms were below
the year ago level for the quarter as a whole. Nondurable goods sales
have continued sluggish and durable goods sales have declined. Unit
sales of new domestic autos apparently declined somewhat from the 8.5
million rate of the second quarter, and appliance sales also turned
down. Only service expenditures maintained their upward momentum.
In addition to the weaker consumption picture, residential
construction activity dipped further in the increasingly taut monetary
atmosphere, and business fixed investment expenditures were estimated
to have grown at a somewhat slower pace in the third quarter.
These developments suggest that a substantially smaller rise
in GNP--about $12 billion--should be evident in the fourth quarter as
Federal spending resumes its downward course, residential construction
activity weakens further, and growth of business investment spending
continues to taper off.
Housing activity may have fallen slightly less in the third
quarter than we had earlier anticipated, starts dropping to an annual
rate of 1.34 million. However, with availability of funds very tight

II -3
and some buyer resistance to higher interest rates apparently develop-
ing, a further reduction in starts to a 1.2 million rate is anticipated
in the fourth quarter, with expenditures expected to drop by an
additional $1.4 billion. Barring a significant shift in monetary policy
toward ease in the near future, we expect starts to fall further in
early 1970, dropping to about a 1.1 million rate in the second quarter.
Growth of business fixed investment spending is still expected
to slow during the next several quarters, but not quite as rapidly as we
had thought earlier. We had adjusted up our projections slightly last
month to reflect newly available information, including the results of
the NICB appropriations survey which suggested that capital spending by
manufacturers would continue to rise into early 1970. We have made
another slight upward adjustment this month in the expected pattern of
capital spending, in response to the investment plans for 1970 reported
in recent private surveys. But our projections still call for a distinct
tapering off of growth. Continued tight credit conditions with high
interest rates are likely to exert a retarding influence. The expected
further slowing of GNP growth is likely to reduce profits further and,
along with a reduced rate of manufacturing capacity utilization, result
in substantial downward adjustment of investment plans. The significant
reduction in new orders for machinery and equipment in the past few
months suggests that this process may have already begun.
Despite larger than expected Federal outlays in the third
quarter, recent official announcements of substantial cuts in defense
spending and the planned curtailment of Federal construction activities

II -4
appear to assure a decline in Federal purchases in the next several
quarters. At the State and local level, some increases in Federal
grants-in-aid are probable and this should support growth in expendi-
tures for some programs, but serious financing difficulties in capital
markets appear likely to curb State and local capital spending and more
than offset increases in the Federally aided programs. As a result,
growth in spending at these levels of government is likely to be smaller
than earlier this year.
With income having substantially outrun consumption in recent
months, and a sharp rise in the saving rate probable in the quarter just
completed, some recovery in the growth of consumption expenditures--
particularly for nondurables--would seem likely in the fourth quarter
with an accompanying decline in the saving rate. But with every other
major sector of demand apparently either declining or showing distinctly
less ebullience, growth of total final demands is expected to ease some-
what further. We have projected inventory accumulation in the fourth
quarter to continue at about the relatively high third quarter rate, but
a larger portion is likely to be unintended.
But inventory accumulation is unlikely to continue strong in
the face of a further weakening of growth of final demands, and downward
adjustments in production should accompany a reduced rate of inventory
accumulation in the first half of next year. Under these conditions,
GNP increases would be significantly smaller, with virtually no growth
in real GNP, or possibly some decline, in the first half of next year.
We still expect that a moderation of price increases would accompany

II -5
such reduced pressure on resources, with the GNP deflator dropping to
under a 3-1/2 per cent rate of increase in the second quarter of next
year.
These projections assume that the tax surcharge will be
extended at a 5 per cent rate for the first half of 1970, that the
investment tax credit will be dropped, and that a 10 per cent increase
in Social Security benefits will take effect on April 1. Elimination
of the tax surcharge entirely on January 1 would raise disposable income,
consumption and corporate profits significantly.

Industrial production. Industrial production in September is
tentatively estimated to have changed little from the July-August level.
This estimate is consistent with such physical volume data as are now
available. If this expectation is realized, the third quarter average
would show an annual rate of growth of about 4.0 per cent from the
second quarter, compared to 6.0 per cent from the first to the second
quarter, and 6.8 per cent from the fourth to the first quarter.
The revised July and preliminary August figures indicated
some decline in output of business equipment and of industrial materials.
These two sectors accounted for the rapidity of the growth in industrial
production from January to June of 1969, as shown in the table.

The rise in consumer goods from June to August reflected high
levels of auto production that are usually associated with the model

II -9
changeover period, and are more or less independent of the sales rate
in order to build up dealers' inventories of new models. In September,
auto assemblies were maintained at the July-August annual rate of 9.0
million units. Production schedules for the fourth quarter are presently
set at about an 8.5 million rate, 7 per cent below a year earlier.
Output of home goods and apparel has changed little since the
beginning of the year and the July-August figures showed some declines.
Considering the weakness in retail sales and the high level of inven-
tories, production of such goods probably eased off further in September.
Overall production of business equipment in September was
probably maintained at about the August level. The sharp decline in
output of industrial equipment from June to August is not likely to be
repeated in the near future. Output of defense equipment has changed
little since March, and in August was about 6 per cent below the July-
August 1968 peak.
Among materials, output of raw steel leveled off in September
at the reduced August rate. It is unlikely that production of other
industrial materials turned up in September in view of the lack of growth
in output of final products, the sustained decline in new housing starts,
and the high cost of further increasing current record inventories of
these materials.
Retail sales. Figures for three weeks ending September 20
suggest that retail sales for the month may show little change from the
August level. As a result, this may be the fourth consecutive month in
which real retail sales have been below year-earlier levels.

II -10
Sales of the automotive group, however, were very strong--
particularly in the last week available--and if it were not for this,
total retail sales for the month might be down by at least 1 per cent.
As noted below, however, the earlier introduction date for the 1970
autos makes it difficult to determine seasonal factors at this time.
The continued decline in housing starts is apparently affecting furni-
ture and appliance sales, as well as those of the lumber, building
material and hardware group, and sales of these two durable goods cate-
gories are tentatively estimated to have declined for the third consecu-
tive month. Sales of all the major types of nondurable goods stores
also apparently declined in September, with the largest drops at apparel
and department stores.
Introduction of 1970 model autos in mid-September by General
Motors and Ford resulted in a surge in sales in the September 10-20
period. On a daily average basis, sales were about one-half larger than
a year earlier when new models had not yet been introduced. A rough
allowance for the seasonal influence suggests the possibility of a season-
ally adjusted annual rate of 9 or more million units in this 10-day
interval. Prior to the latest figure, sales had been running at an
annual rate of about 8 million units. A more reliable specification of
the seasonal factors in the intervals containing and surrounding the
model introduction dates cannot be made for some time. So far as gaug-
ing the strength of consumer demand for autos is concerned, the situation
is further complicated by the fact that fleet purchases are normally made
in large volume early in the new model period. Stocks of new cars
remained at an advanced level, 12 per cent above a year earlier.

II -11
Consumer credit. Growth of consumer instalment credit
apparently slackened further in August. Incomplete reports suggest that
the seasonally adjusted increase in outstandings will total approximately
$7.3 billion at an annual rate, the smallest monthly advance since
January 1968. Instalment credit expanded by $7.5 billion in July and
$9 billion in the first half of 1969.
Extensions of auto credit contracted sharply during July and
August, reflecting mainly the decline in new car sales. The decline
was tempered somewhat by continued strong sales of used cars and higher
average notes on used car contracts. With repayments well maintained,
auto credit outstanding increased at only a $1.3 billion annual rate in
July-August, less than one-half the rate in the first half of this year.
The seasonally adjusted proportion of new cars sold on credit
has changed little; in July 67.3 per cent of the new cars sold were
financed, about one percentage point less than both the first half
average and the July 1968 figure. Used car financing eased to 76 per
cent of the units sold by franchised dealers in July, from 79 per cent
in the first half of the year and 81 per cent last July.
Extensions and repayments for "other consumer goods" eased
slightly this summer but the increase in outstandings exceeded the first-
half average, and also the average for the full year 1968. This strong
performance may be due to the surge in mobile home sales (and the large
instalment contracts for these units) which more than offset the summer
softness in furniture and appliance sales that was probably associated
with the sustained decline in conventional housing starts.

Michigan survey of consumer demand. The August-September
index of consumer sentiment declined sharply to the lowest level since
1958. Responses to all five attitudinal questions were lower for the
second consecutive quarter. Unlike the previous deterioration in
sentiment, which occurred primarily among lower income families, the
latest downward shift was among the upper income families.
Families' evaluation of their likely personal financial
situations a year from now has apparently been seriously affected by
inflation. The proportion expecting to be worse off jumped from 6 per
cent in May-June to 14 per cent in the third quarter--the highest pro-
portion since the question was first asked in 1953. The reason was
clearly higher prices rather than lower income.

Responses to other questions (not included in the index) were
also pessimistic. Families thought that unemployment was more likely
to increase, and the number planning to buy a new car was lower than a
year ago although used car purchase plans were higher. Less than half
of the respondents thought that the government was trying to slow
inflation and only 42 per cent of these (18 per cent of all respondents)
also thought that the government would be successful in its efforts.
The most frequently mentioned item of "bad news" was "tight
credit" and "high interest rates." This was cited as a problem more
frequently than the decline in the stock market, and the table below
suggests that some consumers may be postponing purchases of cars,
household durables, and homes because of monetary restraint.

Cyclical indicators. The preliminary Census composite leading
indicator declined slightly in August after rising in July and is still
less than 1 per cent below its April-May high. The coincident composite
continued to increase. Based on the current performance, it would be

II -14
difficult to conclude that an upper turning point has already been
reached. The behavior of the leading composite would not, however, be
inconsistent with a turning point in the next few months.
(The leading indicator composite has been revised by the
substitution of an unemployment claims series for the nonagricultural
placements series. The revision does not much change the recent move-
ments of the series.)

The July leading composite was revised upwards with the
inclusion of net business formation and July's high inventory change
figure. In August, series decreasing included the manufacturing work-
week, durable new orders, contracts and orders for plant and equipment,
housing permits, common stock prices, and the ratio of price to unit
labor cost. Industrial materials prices continued to rise and there
was a slight improvement (i.e. decline) in unemployment claims. The
preliminary September materials and common stock price indexes were up.

Manufacturers' orders. New orders at durable goods manufac-
turers declined 2 per cent in August, with most industry and market
categories lower. Shipments rose, backlogs fell, and the ratio of
backlog to shipments declined. Unfilled orders at machinery and equip-
ment manufacturers dropped for the first time since last November.
Orders had been strong in July and the July-August average is
still above the second-quarter average for the total and for most cate-
gories. New orders for machinery and equipment, however, have fallen
off from their April high and are well below the second-quarter average.
Defense orders had rebounded in July from a low second quarter but are
below last winter's levels.

Business inventories. In August, manufacturers' stocks rose
much less than the high July rate, but the July-August average increase
still exceeded the average for the preceding two quarters. Trade in-
ventories jumped in July. With retail sales continuing weak for the
rest of the third quarter and auto production running well ahead of
sales, further increases in trade stocks seem likely. With the slowing
of the quarter-over-quarter rise in wholesale prices, meaning that
relatively more of the book value increase represents an increase in
physical volume of inventories than has been the case recently; it seems
probable that the corporate inventory valuation adjustment (IVA) will
drop appreciably from the $6 billion annual rate in the first half.
Both the available data on book values and the smaller IVA support
over projections of an increase in inventory investment on a GNP basis
in the third quarter.

Durable goods retail stocks changed little in July; the buildup
in nondurable retail stocks, on the other hand, was very large. All
nondurable categories increased in July, with the largest part of the rise
at general, drug, and other retailers. The major retail inventory-sales
ratios were up from the lows of April to late-1966 levels.

In August, the durable goods manufacturers' inventory-shipments
ratio dropped slightly, but there was a further rise in their ratio of
inventories to unfilled orders.
Residential construction and real estate. Seasonally adjusted
private housing starts continued to decline in August for the seventh
consecutive month. Unlike the drop in July, the August decline was
moderate and was concentrated entirely in single-family starts. Regionally,
the movement was quite mixed, with a sharp upturn in the North Central
states from a particularly low rate and a slight rise in the Northeast
offsetting most of the decline in the West and South.

1/ Seasonally adjusted annual rates; preliminary.
Given the minor further decline in permits in August, the
relatively large backlog of commitments--including FNMA commitments--still
available, and technical measurement considerations, starts in September
may at least have leveled off at the reduced August rate. If so, this
would yield a third quarter average of 1.34 million units, seasonally
adjusted annual rate. This would be 17 per cent below the average in the
first half year, though still appreciably above the 1.08 million rate in
the third quarter of 1966 when multifamily starts were considerably lower
than has been the case this year. Moreover, further reductions are clearly
indicated for the period ahead by the sustained downward pressures on flows
to financial intermediaries this year and the evidence now available from
the latest FRB-FHLBB Lender Survey which is discussed in a special attach-
ment to the Green Book.

II -19
Based on data now available, indications are that toward
pressures on home prices mounted further this summer. In July, for
example, median prices of existing homes actually sold were 11 per cent
above a year earlier, according to the National Association of Real
Estate Beards. This compared with an average year-to-year increase
of about 7 per cent during the first half of 1969. Sales of such homes,
meanwhile, edged below the advanced year-earlier level for the first
time this year.
Labor market. Employment growth eased in most major industries
this summer and the manufacturing workweek drifted down slowly from March
through August. The slowing of growth was associated with some increases
in insured unemployment claims in late August and early September. An
increase in total joblessness probably occurred in September.
A major element in the slowing of overall employment growth
was the reduction in construction employment, which was due partly to
strikes and partly to reduced residential building. Construction-related
manufacturing industries also showed slight declines. Restraints on
Federal spending and hiring resulted in small employment reductions in
government and in defense-related manufacturing industries, while
State and local governments added relatively few employees between May
and August.

Job gains continued in the capital-goods and primary metals
industries, but here too, some slowing appeared to be developing. Changes
in other sectors were also more moderate, in part reflecting the sluggish-
ness of consumer buying. The only sizable increase this summer occurred
in August in the transportation equipment sector of manufacturing, where
an early model changeover in the auto industry boosted the employment
figure by 150,000 from July and by about the same amount from the average
level over the prior 12 months. The bulk of this increase was due to
the timing of the changeover and a sizable decline is anticipated for
this industry in September.
Income and wages. Although employment growth slowed this
summer, personal income gains amounted to a $5 billion each in July
and August. However, income flows were supplemented in both months by
special factors. The most important of these was the Federal pay raise
which added about $2-1/2 billion to growth in July and $1/2 billion in

II- 21
August. The August figure was also inflated to some extent by the early
model changeover in the auto industry. Exclusive of these one-time
stimulants, the growth rate of income in the past few months was slower
than in the prior six months and slower than in 1968.

The moderate employment advances expected in the next few months
should serve to restrain the growth of wage and salary payments; sizable
advances in hourly earnings, however, will keep the total growing.
Average hourly earnings continued to rise strongly in July and August,
with the momentum being maintained in part by very large wage increases
in recently negotiated construction industry contracts. Increases
in hourly earnings from a year ago averaged 6.8 per cent in July
and August for production and nonsupervisory workers on private non-
farm payrolls, with construction workers showing an increase of nearly
9 per cent. Any slowing in the rise of hourly earnings would likely
be attributable to employer cutbacks of overtime and the comparatively
low level of collective bargaining activity through year end. In 1970,

II- 22
a series of large, important contracts--including the railroad, trucking,
rubber, construction and auto industries--are scheduled for renegotiation.
Unions in these industries will demand catch-up wage increases, and
given the accelerated price increases of 1968-1969, it is doubtful that
large boosts in basic wage rates can be prevented, even in the presence
of an easing labor market and reduced profit margins.
Wholesale prices. Wholesale prices in September rose at about
the same 1 per cent annual rate as in August, according to preliminary
BLS estimates, but the rise in industrial commodity prices edged down to
an annual rate of 4 per cent following the upward revised 5 per cent of
August. The somewhat smaller rate of rise in September was not unexpected
in view of the concentration of price increases for steel mill products
in August, and does not diminish the impression that pressures on
industrial prices have not moderated appreciably as yet. In fact, the
September rise was about the same as the average monthly increase over
the past year. Preliminary estimates also indicate that nearly one-half
of industrial product classes showed increases in September--a substantially
higher proportion than in August and close to the level of June and July.
Prices of metals accounted for about half the increase in the
industrial commodity average in September, following a rise of 6.7 per
cent in the first eight months of the year. Non-ferrous metals increased
about 13.0 per cent over the same period and in September zinc, copper,
steel, and aluminum products prices were raised by some producers. A

II -23
substantial increase in nickel prices is expected to follow the settle-
ment of a prolonged strike at major Canadian producers which normally
supply most of the U.S. market; stainless steel prices have already been
increased to reflect nickel shortages.
Other industrial commodity price increases in September included
apparel, footwear, electric power, paperboard, and concrete. The increase
in machinery prices accelerated.
Increases in price for 1970 autos have been announced, but it
cannot yet be determined whether they will be larger or smaller than in
1968. Judging from manufacturers' announcements, major appliance prices
will rise this fall, and this may also be true for television sets.
Cattle prices have been declining since early summer, and
hog prices are below August peaks; these accounted for most of the 0.6
per cent decline in the farm products index in September. Meat
prices are reflecting these declines, but may not fall much further since
the fourth quarter supply of meats is expected to rise less than seasonally.
At present, it looks as though any decline in meat prices may be temporary.

Consumer prices. Consumer prices increased at an annual rate
of about 5 per cent in August, a smaller rise than in the preceding several
months. As in recent months, food and services contributed most to the
increase. The index was 5.6 per cent above a year earlier.
Food prices in August rose less sharply than in the preceding two
months. Beef prices fell, for the first time in eight months, but the
price of pork and other meats rose sufficiently to offset the drop. Eggs
rose particularly sharply as consumers shifted from meat to eggs, and fruits
and vegetables declined less than seasonally.
On the other hand, the increase in the cost of services
accelerated in August. Home and automobile repair costs rose at a fast
pace and gas and electric utility rates increased. Rents rose at a
rate of about 5 per cent, but this was less than half the rate of rise in
the services and costs connected with homeownership.
Among nonfood commodities, apparel declined in price in August
for the first time in 4 years, reflecting in part late summer sales.
However, in view of rising wholesale prices of apparel, this is probably
no more than a temporary remission in the rise in apparel prices, which
in August were over 5 per cent above a year earlier.

THE ECONOMIC PICTURE IN DETAIL
Domestic Financial Situation
Bank credit. Commercial bank credit is estimated to have
declined slightly in September as a sharp drop in holdings of U.S.
Treasury securities more than offset moderate increases in loans and
holdings of other securities. Bank credit has now remained virtually
unchanged for four months, with declines in investments approximately
offsetting a moderate advance in loans. Credit extended through the
banking system has risen moderately over this period, however, if the
net increase in commercial paper issued by affiliates of banks is taken
into account.

III -2
The sharp decrease in holdings of U.S. Treasury securities
in September was confined primarily to short-term bills apparently
reflecting bank distribution of the Treasury strip bills acquired
in the late August financing. The increase in other security
holdings, the first monthly advance since March, presumably reflected
in large part underwriting by New York City banks of the $450 million
of short-term notes sold by the State of New York on September 12.
There was also a small rise in holdings of other securities at
nonweekly reporting banks in early September, following a small
decline over the summer, but holdings at large banks outside New
York City continued to decline.
The September advance in total loans was scattered among
a number of categories with small gains recorded in all major classes
except loans to nonbank financial institutions. Consumer loans increased
at the reduced rate of recent months, while real estate loans rose
somewhat faster reflecting in part a sizable loan reclassification
in one District.
Despite large tax payments, business loans are estimated
to have increased only $300 million in September or slightly less
than the average monthly rise over the preceding three months.
Compared with earlier in the year, recent growth has slowed considerably.
Even after adjustment for outright sale of loans, business loan
expansion in recent months has been well below its pace earlier this
year. Judging from scattered reports of bankers and the probable

III -3
trend of inventory investment this summer, this moderation in business
loan growth seems to be attributable predominantly to reduced
willingness and ability of banks to lend.
Bank sources of funds. Member bank deposit balances,
measured on a daily average basis, increased moderately in September.
A sharp build-up in U.S. Treasury deposits around the mid-September
tax date was mainly responsible for this expansion, which represents
the first month-to-month increase in total deposits since April.
Private demand balances also rose slightly, and time deposits con-
tinued to fall but at a considerably slower pace than in recent
months.

Continued heavy runoff of large CD's was again responsible
for a major part of the drop in total time deposits. Substantial
CD attrition has been usual during September in recent years, but this
year's decline was quite large, particularly when measured in relation
to the sharply reduced level of outstandings. A large portion of the
decline in CD's took place over the two weeks encompassing the corporate
tax and dividend dates, when attrition on maturing CD's was nearly 80
per cent. As in other recent months, a considerable proportion of
the CD attrition occurred at banks outside New York City.
Consumer-type time and savings deposits continued to decline
in September but at a much reduced rate. While savings deposits
declined further, this drop was offset in part by a small rise in
time certificates and open account deposits.
Net acquisition of funds from nondeposit sources, which had
diminished considerably in recent months, turned into net outflows
in September as slight declines occurred in both Euro-dollar borrowings
and other nondeposit liabilities. Loan RP's continued to runoff
sharply and Euro-dollar borrowings from sources other than foreign
branches trailed off. Continued growth in commercial paper issued
by bank holding companies or affiliates, although at a somewhat
slower pace, partly offset the reduction in bank nondeposit sources.
An analysis of individual bank data suggests that for the most part,
there has been little correlation between changes in the two types of

financing, with only a few banks using commercial paper issues of
their affiliates to offset declines in the banks' sources of nondeposit

Further revisions in the money supply data--made necessary
by new benchmark data and the updating of seasonal factors--have
resulted in some further changes in the magnitude and timing of money
supply growth this year, but the changes were relatively minor
as compared with the August revision for Euro-dollar float. Based
on averages of daily figures for the last month of each quarter, the
money supply increased at a 4.1 per cent annual rate in the first
quarter and at a 4.5 per cent annual rate in the second quarter instead
of at the annual rates of 2.9 per cent and 4.7 per cent, respectively,
indicated by the August revisions.-
In September, the money supply rose at an annual rate of
only about 1 per cent, reflecting in part the substantial rise in
U.S. Government deposits. The annual rate of growth for the third
quarter appears to be working out to less than 1 per cent on the
revised basis.

Nonbank depositary intermediaries. Pressure on savings

savings growth slowed further during July and August from the modest
second quarter pace. On an unadjusted basis, through the first eight
months of this year, there was a loss of deposits, excluding interest
credited, from both types of institutions. The recent developments
suggest that a further sizeable outflow can be expected during the
current reinvestment period.1966

Takedowns of previous commitments have maintained net mortgage
lending of the thrift institutions. With reduced inflows, these
institutions have not been able to rebuild their liquidity since the
July interest-crediting period and will have to rely more heavily on
other sources of funds to meet expected withdrawals.
In October, as in other recent months, S&Ls can be expected
to draw extensively on FHLB advances. The FHLB System is entering
the current reinvestment period with a fairly high $1.1 billion in
liquid funds available for advances, including $500 million of new
money received from its September financing. So far this year, the
FHLB System has raised $2.4 billion of new money from the market,
and in the remaining months of this year it is expected to raise
additional large amounts to maintain its support of the mortgage
market.

Liquidity of mutual savings banks has also been greatly
reduced. Heavy outflows during the current reinvestment period are
thus likely to place many of these institutinns under considerable
strain. To meet their commitments, MSB's may have to activate
bank credit lines and/or take sizeable losses in the liquidation
of some of their less marketable Agency and corporate securities.
Mortgage market. With savings inflows at thrift institutions
off sharply and overall prospects for the current reinvestment period
bleak, the residential mortgage market continued to tighten during
September. The latest FHA and FNMA field office reports, as well as
the recently conducted FRB-FHLBB survey, indicate that the demand for
mortgage funds continues to exceed supply in most areas. Furthermore,
the FRB-FHLBB survey results (being distributed with this Greenbook)
suggest that the supply of short-term and long-term credit was more
limited in early September than at any other time this year.
Reflecting the low level of liquidity and the concern of
thrift institutions about future savings flows, the seasonally adjusted
dollar volume of new commitments at all savings and loan associations
and New York State mutual savings banks apparently fell further in
August, to the lowest level since November 1966. The backlog of
outstanding commitments fell again, but still remains unusually high
relative to earlier years. The size of this backlog, in the context
of the severe liquidity pressures faced by the institutions, suggests
further constraint on new commitment activity. Although policy loan

III -11
pressures have continued quite strong, the most recent life insurance
company data (July) suggest that new mortgage commitments have not
declined further from their modest year ago pace, but the share
accounted for by 1-4 family residential mortgages declined to
extremely low levels. High yields and "equity kickers" on income
properties continue to make such mortgages much more attractive.

The scarcity of funds available for residential mortgage
investment continued to increase pressures on mortgage interest rates
in September. Average secondary market yields in FNMA's forward
commitment auction of Government-underwritten loans advanced each
week during September, despite the large volume of FNMA commitments
accepted, and by the September 29 auction the average yield on 6-
month commitments had risen above the previous high reached early
in July.

In the primary home mortgage market, the average contract
rate on conventional first mortgages rose again in August, as usury
ceilings were relaxed somewhat in the North Central region. However,

low usury ceilings in a number of states continued to blunt the
rise of mortgage interest rates and to disrupt the potential flow
of funds into mortgages. Due in part to the unwillingness of
sellers to absorb deeper discounts, average secondary market
yields on Government-underwritten home loans remained unchanged
in August.

Corporate security and municipal bond markets. While stock
prices have changed little on balance in moderate trading throughout
September, corporate bond prices have declined substantially. At
month-end, yields on new issues of corporate bonds were at new
highs, nearly 25 basis points above the peaks a month earlier. Even
at these higher yields, a sizeable number of new issues have received
lukewarm responses from investors and remain largely unsold. In
contrast, municipal bond yields have declined about 30 basis points
over the month, associated with a sharply reduced volume of new
offerings and possibly hopes that the ultimate tax reform bill will
be less restrictive than the House Bill regarding tax-exempt bond
income.

The recent run-up in corporate yields reflects not only
mounting bond volume, but also the limited demand from institutional
investors. Furthermore, there appears to be increasing investor
hesitancy to commit funds at long-term because of expectations of
a continued strong economy and restrictive monetary policy. Life
insurance companies and mutual savings banks have virtually with-
drawn from the public bond market as their cash positions have come
under increasingly severe pressure. State and local pension funds--
the largest single buyers of public corporate debt--are reportedly
buying new issues quite selectively, allocating most of their cash
to the money and equity markets. Managers of these funds appear
to be expecting further upward yield movements and/or to be awaiting
a clarification of underlying trends before returning more fully
to the bond market. Individuals thus appear to be among the current
major buyers of bonds.
The September volume of corporate new issues was sizable and
contributed to the upward pressure of yields. Public bond issues
aggregated $1.2 billion, a more than seasonal rise from the $0.7
billion offered in August. Stock offerings also exhibited an advance
from the month earlier, owing to the clustering of several large
preferred stock issues by utility companies. Thus, total corporate
security offerings in September, including private placements,
amounted to nearly $2.5 billion, significantly above the pace
earlier in the year.

Corporate security offerings in October are estimated to
decline somewhat in total from the September pace, due largely to a
lighter schedule of stock issues. However, total new offerings in
October would still be significantly above the average monthly volume
during the third quarter, Public corporate bond offerings are expected
to remain at September's $1.2 billion volume. The large financing
requirements of public utility firms are again reflected in a heavy
slate of utility offerings. It is assumed that convertible bond
financing will continue to be somewhat discouraged by the level of
stock prices, so that many such issues postponed earlier this year
will not be marketed in October.

III -17
State and local government bond issues have been reduced
sharply. The volume of long-term offerings in September is estimated'
at $525 million, less than one-half of the average volume for the
first half of this year. While short-term issues continue to represent
an alternative source of funds, these offerings have not been of
sufficient volume to offset fully the shortfall in long-term financing,
For the third quarter, as a whole, long-term issues of about $2.5
billion were less than one-half of the amount planned by governmental
units--according to our recent survey of borrowing anticipations,
and pressure to cut-back capital outlays should be increasing
markedly. This situation is expected to continue as October bond
volume is estimated at only $600 million, a level which assumes
that municipal interest rates will not decline much further.

Corporate Finance. The slowdown in corporate financing in
credit and capital markets during the summer occurred at a time
when the flow of internal funds showed little change and total outlays
for plant and equipment and inventories spurted again. Despite the
step-up in corporate security offerings in September, net funds
raised from this source in the quarter as a whole were at a seasonally
adjusted rate one-eighth below either the first or second quarter, and
short-term borrowing from banks and other lenders also declined. As
these and other data have become available for the third quarter, it
has become increasingly clear that corporations must have reduced
their holdings of liquid assets considerably since midyear.
Moreover, rough projections for the fourth quarter suggest
that the nonfinancial corporate universe will need to raise, from some
combination of new borrowing and further reduction in liquid assets,
as large a volume of funds as in the third quarter. In the table
below, it is assumed that financing in credit and equity markets
will increase somewhat, but will remain below the volume of the first
half of the year, and that liquid assets will again be reduced, though
not by as much as in the third quarter.

The assumption that corporations will continue to reduce their
holdings of liquid assets over the final quarter of the year, rather
than to accelerate the volume of their new borrowing, reflects not
only the level of interest rates and reduced credit availability but
also new estimates of corporate financial flows in the second quarter.
In particular, more complete data for that quarter suggest that holdings
of liquid assets, rather than having been substantially reduced, remained
about unchanged from the first quarter level.

III -20
However, the reduction in liquid assets shown in the table
for the third and fourth quarters of this year would leave the relative
liquidity position of corporations as a whole at the end of the year
well below its level of a year earlier, following a decline of only
seasonal proportions in the first half of 1969. Thus, it seems
likely that corporations will be under pressure to increase the volume
of their net long-term financing at the earliest opportunity to levels
above those apparent in the third quarter and presently projected for
the final quarter. Moreover, it is conceivable that the increase
could come before the end of the year, although there is as yet no
evidence which would support such a projection.
Government securities market. The U. S. Government securities
market--except in the bill area--continued persistently weak during
the last three weeks and price declines accelerated in the final days
of September. Consequently, yields again have reached new highs, and
are now generally up about 30 to 60 basis points in the note and bond
area since the last FOMC meeting. The composite yields on intermediate
and long-term securities have reached recent peaks of 7.91 and 6.57 per
cent, respectively.
In contrast, short-term Treasury bill rates have declined
recently, after reaching their highs in the third week of September
when the 3-month rate closed at a record level of 7.16 per cent.
Taking the last three weeks as a whole, short-dated bills have
declined by 10 to 20 basis points, while the one-year bill is unchanged
on balance.

The advances in note and bond yields reflected the continued
effects of a tight credit policy. Special factors contributing to
the weak market atmosphere were the sizable buildup of new corporate
financings, the prospect of heavy fourth quarter borrowing in the
Federal agency market, and difficulty in finding investors for the
new Treasury notes offered in the recent refunding.
Yields in the Treasury coupon market adjusted upwards partly
in anticipation of the refunding. The Government offered three
new notes in exchange for the $8.9 billion of securities maturing on
October 1 and in mid-December, $7.6 billion of which were held by
the public. Preliminary results from the Treasury indicate that around
$3.4 billion of rights were exchanged for the new 8 percent 19-month
note, while about $1.0 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively, were

III -22
turned in for the 3-1/2 year 7-3/4's and the 6 year 10 month 7-1/2's.
This gives an over-all attrition rate of about 24 per cent of the
publicly held rights.
The initial market reaction to the refunding was generally
favorable, and the new notes moved quickly to premiums on a when-
issued basis. Dealers took substantial positions in these issues,
aggregating about $900 million just after the books closed on
September 24. Most recently, the weight of the positions, together
with some floating supply in the hands of trading banks and other
temporary holders, has exerted downward pressure on new issue
prices. By Monday, September 29, the new issues had fallen 6/32
to 1/2 point below their initial offering price, and dealers had
reduced their positions by about $150 million.

Bill rates increased through the middle of September. Since
then, however, the market has been helped by a fair-sized amount of
demand, including sizable buying by the System for foreign cccounts.
The Desk bought almost $1.0 billion of bills for such accounts in
the last half of September. Actual and anticipated bill demand also
resulted from the refunding-- from attrition money as well as selling
of rights.
Other short-term credit markets. During September, short-
term interest rates outside the Treasury bill market have increased
for some instruments while remaining constant for others. Rates
on 3-month commercial paper have shown the greatest advances--
about 50 basis points--to 8.75 percent, thus climbing higher than
the prime rate. On the other hand, rates on finance paper have
remained steady at 7.63 per cent. With Treasury bill rates
declining slightly recently, the spread between bill rates and
other short-term market rates widened.

Short-term rates in the agency market fluctuated within
a narrow range during the month, but yields in the 9 to 12-month
area--in which the new cash financing was concentrated--did move
moderately higher. Thus the August 20, 9-month FICB offering had
carried a yield of 8.12 per cent whereas a comparable September 19
offering yielded 8.20 per cent. The amount of new cash raised in
the agency market was substantially lower in September than the except-
ionally large August volume but cash borrowing did remain larger than
usual for the month--with the Federal Home Loan Banks raising a sizable
amount of new cash.

Federal finance. Data on outlays early in fiscal 1970 suggest
that the Administration may have difficulty holding the year's total
to $192.9 billion. September spending alone could be almost $2 billion
higher than projected in the last Greenbook, implying a third quarter
total $4 billion larger than a year earlier. Heavy defense expenditures
account for some of the recent surge in outlays, but contract awards,
usually a reliable leading indicator of defense spending, foreshadow
lower expenditures for the rest of the year. On the other hand, the
high level of outlays this quarter by the Commodity Credit Corporation
may be maintained for the rest of the year. On balance, it is too
early to estimate the total size of offsetting expenditure cuts that could
take place later during the fiscal year, and the staff continues to
project total outlays in the amount of $192.9 billion (See Appendix B
for further details).
The large expenditures have led to a smaller increase in the
Treasury cash balance in September than projected earlier. An
additional $600 million drain on the balance is expected during
October and November from the Housing Assistance Administration
and the Renewal Assistance Administration. These agencies cannot
finance their activities in the usual way by selling in the municipal
bond market because of a 6 per cent ceiling imposed by Congress
on their debt issues; consequently, the Treasury must provide
operating funds until HAA and RAA can repay these funds, presumably
before the end of the fiscal year.

III -26
Despite the Treasury expectations that the large September
outflow will be offset later in the fiscal year, $5 to $6 billion
new cash appears to be needed before the. end of this calendar year.
Presumably this would be raised through tax anticipation bills, part
of them issued in October and the remainder in November. Even so
the end-of-year cash balance would still be on the low side and thus
would require additional borrowing early in January to cover the usual
seasonal drain in that period.
The current Staff estimate of the fiscal 1970 surplus is
$3.7 billion. In evaluating the degree of fiscal restraint implied,
however, it should be recalled that five government sponsored agencies--
FNMA, FICB, Banks for Coops, FLB, and FHLB--whose operations were
included under the old cash budget concepts have now been dropped
from the budget data. If agency lending during fiscal 1970 were
included in the budget, the staff would estimate a fair-sized
deficit--in the order of $5 to $6 billion. The Federal sector in the
NIA accounts, however, which excludes all Federal lending operations,
continue to show a sizable estimated surplus for fiscal year 1970.

THE ECONOMIC PICTURE IN DETAIL
International Developments
Foreign exchange markets. The major development in exchange
markets during September was the build-up of speculation on a mark
revaluation and finally the German government's decision to allow the
mark exchange rate to "float" for a while, at least until a new govern-
ment is formed. The large movement of funds into German marks, which
tended to accelerate the week before the German elections, was halted
when the Bundesbank stopped operating in exchange markets Thursday and
Friday. (This suspension continued for most of the trading day Monday
after the elections.) Between the beginning of September and the
suspension of its exchange operations the Bundesbank purchased $1.4
billion spot. Its swap business -- new and maturing swap transactions --
resulted in net payments of about $230 million, so that Bundesbank
reserves increased from these transactions a little less than $1.2
billion in September.
Trading in the mark on Tuesday, September 30 -- the first day
of dealings under the new floating arrangement -- was orderly although
the volume of trading was generally considered to be below its normal
level. The exchange rate climbed to a peak of 26.10 cents/mark -- a
little more than 4 per cent above the mark's current par value. Trading
continued very orderly on Wednesday and the mark rate pushed to 26.43 cents/
mark -- about 5.7 per cent above par.

IV -2
The market for sterling was relatively firm during most of
September although the pound did suffer in the week prior to the
German elections from selling pressures, which abated after the
Bundesbank's withdrawal from the market. The announcement of the
favorable trade results for August at mid-month gave a short-lived
boost to the demand for sterling. The Bank of England was able to
purchase net $120 million during September. The market's more favorable
view of sterling was also reflected in the substantial narrowing of
the discount on forward sterling. The 3-month discount narrowed to 3.2
per cent per annum at the end of the month from about 9 per cent at the
beginning of the month.
The Italian lira and French franc, in September, were under
selling pressure which tended to get heavier toward the end of the
month. The lira rate stayed at its lower limit most of the time and
the Bank of Italy sold about $450 million during the month. The Bank
of France lowered its support level for the franc several times during
the month and held its losses to an estimated $150 million. At the
end of the month the franc rate was at its lowest level since devaluation,
17.95 cents/franc compared with its lower limit of 17.87.
Demand for the Dutch guilder and Swiss franc was strong in
September. The Swiss National Bank purchased about $300 million, which
largely reflected the repatriation of dollars by Swiss commercial banks
for quarter-end liquidity needs.

IV -3
Euro-dollar market. After advancing steadily during August
and the first few days of September, Euro-dollar interest rates peaked
out, and subsequently declined moderately. For deposits with maturities
from one month to one year the highs were about 11 to 11-1/2 per cent
per annum. The three-month deposit rate declined to a low for the
month of 10-5/8 per cent on September 24, and since then has advanced
by about 5/8 per cent to around 11-1/4 per cent. Rates in most other
maturities have increased since September 24 by 1/8 to 1/4 per cent.
U.S. bank takings of Euro-dollar funds through their branches
increased fairly steadily from the end of August through the second
week of September -- rising by about $600 million. These borrowings
then declined by a roughly equal amount in the two weeks ending
September 24. This easing of U.S. bank demand helps to explain the
rate decline. Assuming that the usual month-end downward adjustment
in these borrowings (often $300-$500 million) occurs in the last few
days of September, there may be a sizable decline in U.S. banks'
liabilities to branches for the month as a whole.
A variety of foreign developments may have influenced the
Euro-dollar market in September. September saw another round of bank
rate increases: the Belgian National Bank raised its discount rate
by 1/2 per cent to 7-1/2 per cent -- its fifth discount rate increase
this year; the Swiss National Bank raised its rate by 3/4 per cent to
3-3/4 per cent -- its first discount rate increase since July of 1967;
the Bundesbank raised its rate by 1 per cent to 6 per cent -- the third

IV -4
German discount rate increase this year; the Austrian National Bank
raised its bank rate a full percentage point to 4-3/4 per cent; and the
Bank of Norway raised its rate from 3-1/2 to 4-1/2 per cent. Thus
major national money markets tightened further during September.
Certain other foreign developments may help to explain the moderate
easing of Euro-dollar rates during most of the month. Most notable
were the sizable flows of speculative capital from the Italian lira
and, perhaps to a lesser extent, from the French franc; a large part
of these flows no doubt reflected demand for German marks but some may
have gone into Euro-dollar deposits or to repay outstanding Euro-dollar
loans. Furthermore, we understand that Japanese banks were reducing
their borrowings of Euro-dollars during September and turning to lower
cost (mainly yen) sources of financing. Finally, though the Bundesbank
purchased a very large amount of dollars while holding the mark at its
upper limit in September, its swap activities with German banks supplied
about a $250 million net increase in forward cover potentially available
for German bank placements in Euro-dollars.

U.S. balance of payments. The early and very partial data
on balance of payments transactions in August and September show
improvement in some sectors though the over-all results for the third
quarter were still very poor. The merchandise trade accounts in
August appear to have begun their hoped-for strengthening; foreigners
returned to net purchases of U.S. equity securities during the month,
and U.S. banks reduced their outstanding claims on foreigners, though
by only a small amount.
On the liquidity basis the July and August deficits (with a
rough allowance for adverse seasonality) were a little under $1 billion
each. In September, unless there was a surge of outflows in the final
week of the month (for which data are not available) related to DM
speculation, the liquidity deficit was probably much lower. This
would result in a quarterly deficit (seasonally adjusted) of somewhat
less than $3 billion, compared to the $3.7 billion deficit of the second
quarter. Moreover, of this more than $500 million is accounted for by
negative "special" transactions in the third quarter, compared to
around $360 million in the second.
In addition to the gain in the trade accounts (discussed
below) the outflow of U.S. private capital was probably much smaller
in the third quarter. Banking claims on foreigners were reduced by
$375 million in July and August, indicating that even after allowance
for the usual large seasonal inflow in the third quarter there was a
major shift from the outflow of nearly $1/2 billion (seasonally adjusted)
in the second quarter. Inflows were widely dispersed, with the largest

IV -6
amounts reported for Europe, but there were outflows to Canada and a
sizable loan was extended to Venezuela. Direct investment outflows
can reasonably be expected to have been lower than the very large
second-quarter rate, and to have contained a larger component of foreign-
source funds -- i.e., U.S. corporations would be making more use of
the proceeds of new issues previously sold abroad. U.S. investors
purchased a much larger amount of new foreign bonds in the third quarter
than in the second -- mainly Canadian issues -- but this change was
offset (according to figures for July and August) by a shift from
sizable net U.S. purchases to small net sales of foreign equity
securities.
Following a net sell-off of $155 million in June-July, foreign
investors purchased about $85 million of U.S. equity securities in
August, despite the unsettled market and high Euro-dollar interest
rates.
Since July there has been a marked change in the behavior of
private foreign liquid claims on the United States. In July such
claims increased by $1.3 billion, but the increase in August was only
about $300 million, and in September the change was probably not
significant either way. The largest component of these changes in
claims is borrowings by U.S. banks from their foreign branches; such
borrowings advanced by almost $900 million in July, but by only about
$300 million in August, and there probably was some net repayment in
September.

IV -7
As a result of the declining inflows of private foreign
short-term funds the balance on official settlements shifted to a
deficit of $650 million in August, and showed a deficit of roughly
$500 million for September, through the 24th. Thus, the third
quarter official settlements balance was a deficit probably approach-
ing$1 billion (the seasonal element on this basis is minor).
U.S. foreign trade. The export surplus increased in August as
exports rose more than imports. For July-August combined, the trade
balance (balance of payments basis) was in surplus by about $3/4 billion
at an annual rate, still low, but a marked improvement over the small
deficit recorded in the first half of the year, and slightly above the
$1/2 billion annual rate in the second half of 1968. Both exports and
imports in July-August were up sharply over the January-June rates;
exports by 12 per cent and imports by 9 per cent. How much of the
improvement in the trade balance and the acceleration in trade movements
in July-August is an aftermath of the dock strike and how much represents
the beginning of the long awaited improvement in our basic trade position
is still difficult to determine.
Exports of both agricultural and nonagricultural commodities
advanced in July-August. The value of shipments of agricultural products
was well above the strike-depressed rate of the first half, and about
equal to the rate in the second half of 1968. July agricultural exports
were very strong, possibly reflecting the reopening of West Gulf ports
(through which about 25 per cent of agricultural exports move) which

IV -8
occurred in April, about 6 weeks later than for other ports. August
agricultural shipments, however, were again down sharply. The effects
of price-cutting in wheat are not yet discernible in the August trade
figures. These lower wheat prices -- 15 to 20 per cent below the
minimum stipulated by the International Grains Arrangement -- may reduce
exports by $100 million in the current crop year ending June 1970.
In contrast, shipments in nonagricultural commodities advanced
sharply in August, the first real rise since March, when most Atlantic
coast ports were in full operation for the first time following the
ending of the strike.
For July-August together, exports of nonagricultural products
were considerably greater than in the first half of this year and the
last half of 1968. Machinery and chemicals rose very sharply, while
shipments of steel -- mainly to Europe but also to Latin America and
Canada -- expanded at an even faster rate. Shipments of automotive
vehicles and parts to Canada fell, possibly reflecting the earlier than
usual changeover to production of 1970 models. Deliveries of commercial
aircraft, which had dipped in the first half, were about unchanged in
July-August.
By areas, total exports to all major markets, except Canada,
were substantially higher in July-August than in the first six months of
the year. Particularly encouraging was the strong upturn in sales to
Western Europe, which had slumped badly in January-June. Shipments to
Japan, already at a high rate, advanced further while exports to the

IV -9
less-developed countries, particularly Latin America, also increased.
The drop in shipments to Canada reflected lower deliveries of auto-
motive vehicles and parts; exports of other commodities to Canada
showed little change from that of the first half.
The import expansion in July-August appears to have been more
broadly-based than in the small advance from the second half of 1968
to the first half of this year. Purchases of foreign nonfood consumer
goods other than automobiles, and of foreign machinery, which had
increased in the first half over those in the preceding half-year
despite the strike, were at a considerably higher rate in July-August
than in the first half. Imports of foodstuffs and industrial materials,
which in the first half of the year had fallen below the rates in the
second half of 1968, also rose in July-August. Imports of iron and
steel, particularly from Europe, increased sharply from their low
levels in the first half of the year. Imports of other materials
associated with manufacturing of durable goods were also much larger.
Partially offsetting these gains in July-August was a sizable decline
in the value of imports of building materials, reflecting lower prices
for lumber and an easing in demand as housing starts here declined from
the very high rate in the first part of this year.
Arrivals of automobiles increased in July-August over those
of the first half. The recent expansion was in cars from Europe and
Japan whereas the growth in the first half of the year over the last
six months of 1968 was entirely in automobiles from Canada.

IV -10
Reserve changes and the Euro-dollar market. An inference
that central banks have become direct suppliers of funds on a consid-
erable scale to the Euro-dollar market may be drawn from available data
on official reserve positions. A large discrepancy exists between the
aggregate increase in reserve assets other than gold and the aggregate
increase in reserve liabilities reflected in the data of the table below.
During the year and a half through mid-1969, when the U.S.
balance of payments on the official settlements basis showed a $4.6
billion surplus, U.S. liabilities to foreign official reserve holders
fell by $3.3 billion while U.S. official holdings of other currencies
rose by $1.0 billion. Meanwhile the U.S. reserve position in the IMF
increased by somewhat more than the amount ($0.9 billion) by which
U.S. gold reserves declined.

During this period Britain and France suffered net drains
of net official reserves (assets less liabilities) exceeding $7
billion. Substantial gains in net official reserves occurred for
many other countries. In the aggregate, net reserve gains of the
United States and others (as reflected in the table) exceeded net
reserve losses by a large amount. In 1967 there had been a negative
discrepancy, and this continued through the first three quarters of
1968. For the next three quarters, over $3 billion of the increase
in world gross reserves (other than gold) is not matched by known
changes in official liabilities, and the discrepancy becomes especially
large for the second quarter of 1969.
Reasons for the discrepancy are under study. Some considerable
part may reflect statistical difficulties. Some part can probably be
ascribed to "recycling" actions and increased holdings by some European
central banks at the BIS, while that institution increased its Euro-dollar
investments (claims against commercial banks rather than central banks).
In addition it seems possible that high Euro-dollar interest rates have
attracted investments directly from some central banks. The success of U.S.
banks in expanding their borrowings from their foreign branches by more than
$6-1/2 billion between September 30 of last year and June 30, 1969, is to
be explained, it seems, not only by massive shifts by foreign commerical
banks and nonbank investors out of other currencies into Euro-dollars,
and by a considerable movement (of uncertain size) on the part of U.S.
investors, but also by some redirection of foreign official reserve
accruals into Euro-dollar deposits.

IV -12
Reserves and balance of payments of other industrial countries
Reserve movements in industrial countries outside the U.S.
were quite large in the second and third quarters, reflecting continuing
disequilibria in basic balances of payments and the speculative capital
flows associated with the lack of adjustment.
The current account surpluses of Germany, Italy and Japan
continued to be large, but of the three only Germany showed large gains
in official reserves. Intense speculation on a revaluation of the German
mark in late April and early May led to a second quarter increase in German
official reserves of $1.9 billion. After a summer lull, speculation in
the mark again became heavy with the approach of the German elections.
The Bundesbank suspended operation in German exchange markets
September 25-26 because of the heavy inflow of dollars, and on
September 29 the decision was made to temporarily allow the mark to
float. Domestic political uncertainty and speculation on a DM revaluation
led to huge capital outflows from Italy, and only the forced reduction
of commercial bank net foreign positions prevented official reserves from
declining sharply in the second quarter. Japanese official reserves
declined as a result of a switch to yen financing of international
transactions by Japanese banks in the second quarter.
For France, continuing large balance of payments deficits and
official reserve losses ($1.2 billion in the second quarter) culminated
in a devaluation of the franc on August 8. Immediately after devaluation,

IV -13
the Bank of France had significant reserve gains, but domestic labor
unrest and the revival of DM speculation in September led to renewed
French losses.
Britain's net reserve gains--which took the form mainly of
repayments of official assistance--were substantial in the first quarter.
There were further gains in the second quarter when there was a surplus
on the basic balance of payments, but as a result of DM speculation the
reserve gains were smaller than in the first quarter. Greatly improved
trade figures for August led to some reserve gains in mid-September,
but renewed speculation in marks led to some reserve losses in the week
before the German elections.
Taken together, the members of the Group of Ten other than
the United States but including Switzerland had a combined balance of
payments deficit on non-monetary transactions of $1.2 billion in the

first quarter of 1969. In the second quarter the position changed to
a surplus amounting to $1.6 billion. Within the Common Market, the
second-quarter surplus of Germany was almost fully offset by the French
and Italian deficits but among the others, Japan, Switzerland, Britain
and Canada all had surpluses in the second quarter. (Balances calculated
on this basis include not only the current account and long-term capital,
but also any short-term capital movements that do not take the form of a
change in the country's commercial banks' external assets or liabilities.
Thus some, but not all, of the speculative movements into marks are
counted in the German surplus on this basis.)
The overall German balance of payments deficit of $635 million
in the first quarter was, predictably, only a temporary phenomenon. In
the second quarter speculation on a mark revaluation together with more
fundamental factors combined to produce a surplus of over $1.8 billion.
The third quarter will undoubtedly also show a huge surplus.
Heavy speculative flows in May and again in September were a
major factor in throwing the balance of payments from deficit into
substantial surplus. But there also was a more important reversion to a
larger basic payments position: the trade surplus, which in the first
quarter had been adversely affected by German tax measures that induced
a bulge in exports at the end of 1968, and by strikes abroad, was not
reduced by cyclical factors, and increased substantially in subsequent
months. Currently, at the height of the boom, it is at about the same
level ($4 billion, annual rate) as in the recession year 1967.

In addition, net long-term capital outflows, $1.5 billion in the
first quarter, fell to $1 billion in the second quarter. The basic deficit
of $1.1 billion in the first quarter was thus reduced to $0.4 billion in
the second.
That the basic balance was still in deficit in the second quarter
is misleading, however, since a large part of the long-term capital export
was financed by the huge inflow of non-bank short-term capital ($2-1/4 bil-
lion in the second quarter). The Bundesbank, in its August report, points
out that the present level of long-term capital export (roughly $4 billion,
annual rate) would not be sustainable solely from domestic savings. Nor
would domestic savings sustain a rate of capital export sufficient to
offset the current account surplus, now running at an annual rate of
about $2.5 billion.
Despite various measures taken by the Bundesbank to hold down
net short-term capital inflows, including encouraging banks to place funds
in the Euro-dollar market through the use of preferential dollar-mark
swap rates, net official reserves increased $500 million in August on
top of a $1.9 billion gain in the second quarter. Before the Bundesbank
ceased support operations on September 25, the central bank had intervention
gains of about $1.4 billion for the month. The September 29 decision to
let the mark float temporarily, and the consequent upward movement of
the price of the mark should substantially reduce the short-term
capital inflow as well as cut into the large current account surplus.

IV -17
During the second quarter and in July and August, Italy's
balance of payments continued to show a severe deterioration from the
previous year because of increased capital outflows. For the first
eight months of the year, Italy incurred an overall deficit of $826 mil-
lion this year as against a surplus of $454 million last year. In
September to date, there has been a large reduction in official reserves
that has probably reflected, in addition to underlying factors, renewed
speculation on a mark revaluation by Italian traders and investors.
The prospect now is for a large deficit in 1969 in excess of $1 billion.
The current account has remained strong; the January-July
current account surplus of $951 million was nearly identical with that
of a year earlier. The net capital outflow overthe first seven months,
however, increased to $1,820 million compared with $769 million a year
earlier. The outflow has become larger in recent months and was slightly
in excess of $300 million in both June and July. The higher capital
outflow reflects anxiety among business and investors, created by
political uncertainty and fears of student and labor unrest, as well as
the much higher rates of interest prevailing in foreign financial markets.
The reduction of Italian commercial banks' net foreign assets
by $531 million in the second quarter--which kept the decline in official
reserves to negligible dimensions--was in response to the directive given
the banks at the end of March that by end-June they repatriate a sum
equal to their net foreign assets on March 31. Later, some exceptions
were granted which allowed $230 million of net foreign assets to be

IV -18
outstanding on June 30. In June, foreign depositors withdrew funds
from lira bank accounts, and further withdrawals have since occurred,
presumably in reflection of some nervousness about the lira. Banks'
net foreign assets rose by $23 million in July-August.
In Japan, the balance of payments as a whole remained in heavy
surplus through August. In July-August, the current account surplus was
$475 million, compared with $279 million in the same period a year earlier.
In recent months, however, export growth has slackened and
import growth has accelerated. This has narrowed the seasonally adjusted
trade surplus substantially. From a peak of $178 million in March this
year, the seasonally adjusted trade surplus (imports c.i.f.) has declined
steadily, and in August there was a $7 million deficit on trade account.
With the recent tightening of monetary policy on September 1, however,
this deteriorating trend may be arrested.
Through March of this year, the balance of payments surpluses
were reflected in large gains in official reserves. In the year ending
March 1969, official reserves increased $1-1/4 billion to reach $3,213 mil-
lion. During the April-July period, however, official reserves declined
as the foreign exchange banks repaid substantial amounts of their short-
term indebtedness and sharply improved their net foreign exchange position.
During the second quarter alone, the foreign exchange banks reduced their
net foreign indebtedness from $830 million to $99 million. This reflected
a shift from foreign currency financing to yen financing of Japanese

IV -19
business--a shift induced by much higher foreign interest rates,
and permitted by the Japanese authorities in view of Japan's strong
payments position.
The overall balance of payments surpluses are likely to
continue in the coming months; however, somewhat smaller surpluses
appear likely.
In France, a huge current account deficit and an adverse
movement of leads and lags combined to produce an overall deficit of
$1.2 billion in the second quarter, and eventually led to the devaluation
of the franc on August 8. Moderate reserve gains in August, after devalua-
tion, were probably a result of some reversal in leads and lags. It is
most improbable that any other capital inflows occurred, since exchange
controls are still in force and constitute a very strong deterrent against
capital return.
The current account, seasonally adjusted, was in deficit by
about $1.9 billion annual rate in the first eight months, and little
improvement is expected before year-end. With a current account deficit
at this rate, it is expected that French reserve losses will continue in
coming months. It is also extremely doubtful that France can achieve her
target of current account balance by mid-1970.
The combination of renewed speculation on a mark revaluation,
and the generally poor reception of the austerity program and the attendant
labor unrest in France may have again shifted leads and lags adversely.

IV -20
In the two weeks prior to the German elections the Bank of France had
intervention losses of some $130 million. On September 26, the French
drew $500 from the IMF to repay some outstanding short-term assistance
from other central banks.
The British basic balance of payments (current account and
long-term capital) registered a surplus of $456 million in the second
quarter, a marked improvement over the $187 million deficit in the previous
quarter. On a seasonally adjusted basis, the improvement was smaller,
but still substantial--a deficit of $124 million in the first quarter gave
way to a surplus of $240 million in the second.
While part of the swing in the seasonally adjusted balance
arose from a $144 million reduction in the trade deficit, the bulk of
the improvement stemmed from a $228 million increase in net long-term
capital inflow, an account which typically shows very erratic quarterly
movements. Much of the long-term capital inflow was accounted for by
a $75 million borrowing in Germany by the U.K. Gas Council and by
heavy foreign purchases of British Petroleum Company equities in
connection with BP's participation in Alaskan oil development.
Movements in net official reserves and commercial banks' net
position have deviated from changes in the basic balance, because there
have been large short-term capital flows other than those through the
banks. Receipts under the import deposit system were significantly
reduced in the second quarter, and there was a large reversal of leads

IV -21
and lags against Britain, undoubtedly connected with speculation on a
mark revaluation and the uncertainty over the viability of the current
parity of the pound. The net position of commercial banks in the U.K.,
including branches of U.S. banks, increased by only $109 million in the
second quarter as both foreign assets and foreign liabilities increased
by nearly $6 billion.
After increasing by $454 million in the first quarter, net
official reserves increased by only $195 million in the second quarter.
A sharp increase in July was followed by an even larger decline in August
as speculative capital outflows resumed in the wake of the franc devalua-
tion. Following the publication of very favorable August trade results
($115 million surplus), the Bank of England had significant intervention
gains until the week preceding the German elections, at which time it
incurred small losses.
Though the trade surplus diminished, Canada's overall balance
of payments was in surplus by $235 million in the second quarter, as
long-term capital inflow continued strong. The unadjusted trade surplus
for the first eight months of the year was $410 million less than for the
same period a year ago, as exports rose at a much slower rate than
imports. For the year as a whole, the trade surplus will probably be
less than half of last year's $1.1 billion.
Official net reserves fell by $45 million in the second quarter,
but the net foreign position of Canadian banks increased by $280 million
as they sharply increased their lending to New York banks with funds

IV -22
raised from "swapped" deposits by Canadian residents. The banking
capital outflow apparently has slowed considerably since mid-July when
the Bank of Canada imposed a temporary ceiling on swapped deposits of
the banks and further tightened domestic money market conditions.

APPENDIX A: REVISION OF MONEY SUPPLY AND COMMERCIAL BANK
TIME DEPOSITS ADJUSTED*
Annual benchmark and seasonal factor revisions were published
September 25 with the regular money supply release. As explained below,
the benchmark corrections raised the levels of both money supply and
time deposits in 1968 and 1969, and seasonal factor changes smoothed
the series over a somewhat longer period. In addition to publication
of revised data from 1967 to date, data for earlier periods will be
published in the October Bulletin, including some minor seasonal changes
for other recent years.
The accompanying charts and tables compare the revised data
with the series published before and after the August correction for
downward bias connected with Euro-dollar float. As may be seen on the
charts, the Euro-dollar float revision in August accounted for most of
the change in level of the money supply, with the benchmark revision
adding another 1/2 percentage point to the growth rate for the first
half of 1969. The revised series still indicates noticeably slower
expansion after April. Slower expansion in recent months is most
evident in the weekly series (chart 2), which has shown little change
since mid-May following wide fluctuations in April.
The decline in time deposits is now estimated at a 4 per cent
annual rate in the first half of 1969, about 1 percentage point less
than before the revisions. Since June, the rate of contraction in the
revised series is at a 19 per cent average annual rate, about 1 per-
centage point greater than estimated earlier. Additional information
on the various adjustments is provided below.
Euro-dollar float adjustment (published in August)
To briefly recap the general effects of the Euro-dollar float
adjustment: the money supply level was increased in 1969 by amounts
ranging from $1.8 billion in January to $3.3 billion in July, with a
sharp spurt in the amount of correction occurring in the second quarter.
Levels were increased by smaller amounts prior to 1969 beginning with
data for June 1967. Annual growth rates were increased by 0.2 percentage
points over the year 1967, by 1/2 percentage point over 1968, and by
1-1/2 percentage points over the first half of 1969.
Benchmark corrections
The table below indicates the amounts of change in currently pub-
lished levels of money supply and time deposits for the three benchmark
dates that are being incorporated in this revision. Effects of bench-
marks on semiannual changes in the series would be reflected in differences
between benchmarks for succeeding dates--e,g., $400 million additional
growth in money supply in the first half of 1969 due to benchmark correc-
tions, $800 million additional growth in nonmember time deposits.

Implications of benchmarks for current estimates
These benchmark corrections were relatively large by past
standards, suggesting a change in the behavior of nonmember deposits
in relation to country member bank deposits from which the nonmember
estimates are derived. Changes in banking structure do not account for
the major part of the estimating error; indeed, the cumulative effects
of bank structure changes on the estimates were insignificant in relation
to the total benchmark corrections. The explanation for the abnormal
behavior of nonmember/country growth rates seems to be that country
bank deposit growth was restricted relative to nonmembers in the first
half of 1969 due to differences in depositor characteristics. With a
greater concentration of fairly large urban banks in the country group,
the interest-sensitivity of depositors in country banks probably is
greater than for nonmembers. This explanation would seem consistent with
the relative size of benchmark corrections for time and demand deposits
as well as with the abnormally faster total deposit growth of nonmembers
relative to country banks.

A -3
In view of the continuation of monetary restraint since June,
it would seem that estimated changes in nonmember deposits probably
were understated during the third quarter before the revision. The
revised data include increased allowances for nonmember growth relative
to the country bank data on which current estimates are based. Such
allowances will be carried forward also as estimates are made in the
fourth quarter in order to reduce the likelihood of further upward
revision when December benchmarks become available.
Seasonal factor revisions
Seasonal factor revisions affect the series mainly in the
period from 1967 to date, with the principal changes in the demand
deposit component of money supply. Seasonal factors for July, August,
and November have been raised and those for March, April, and September
lowered. The result of these changes is to smooth out the monthly and
quarterly pattern of change in demand deposits and the money supply,
with the first and second quarters now showing similar growth rates in
1969. These changes also reduce the tendency for the seasonally adjusted
money supply figures to show large increases in July and August.
Time deposits seasonal factors have been lowered slightly
over the months from February through July, raising the level of the
series in these months, and factors for the August through November
period have been raised with opposite effects on seasonally adjusted
levels.

APPENDIX B: SUMMER BUDGET REVIEW
The Summer Budget Review, released by the Bureau of the
Budget on September 17, indicates no change in the earlier estimate of
total outlays for fiscal 1970. The Administration's current forecast
of receipts, $198.8 billion, is $.4 billion less than its May 20 esti-
mate, but above the $196.6 billion in receipts presently being projected
by the Board Staff for fiscal 1970.

Surplus 3.1 6.3 5.9 3.7
At present the legal ceiling on budget outlays stands higher
than the Administration's estimate of $192.9 billion for fiscal 1970.
Congress established a $191.9 billion limit with provision for two
types of adjustments. The ceiling adjusts automatically if Congressional
action or inaction has a net effect on spending. The President may also
adjust the ceiling by as much as $2 billion for increases in certain
administratively uncontrollable items specified in the Act. As of
August 31, the President specified increases of $1.5 billion under the
latter provision, thereby raising the legal ceiling to $193.4 billion.
Congressional action may raise the ceiling further.
The Administration remains committed to holding total outlays
to the $192.9 billion announced earlier, despite the higher legal
ceiling. However, substantial adjustments have been made in individual
items. The table below shows that increased outlays for several programs
are intended to be offset primarily by decreases in defense spending.

September 17 Estimate of Outlays 192.9
The Administration attributes most of the increased spending
by HEW to Medicare and Medicaid programs and to increases in assistance
payments. However, the recently proposed 10 per cent hike in Social
Security benefits (involving more than $.6 billion in fiscal 1970) is
scheduled to go into effect only in April 1970 and thus does not require
more funds than the 7 per cent hike that had been budgeted previously.
Most of the increases in Agriculture expenditures is said to arise
because Congress is unlikely to eliminate the special milk and agricul-
ture conservation programs and from the Administration's proposed ex-
pansion of the food stamp program. The Administration seems to be
anticipating less than a $100 million increase in its estimate of:CCC
outlays, though present crop yields suggest an increase of perhaps
$900 million.
The Budget Review indicates that about $2.5 billion of the
$3.7 billion increases shown in the above table result from "uncontrollable"
items. Congressional action or inaction to date accounts for at least an
additional $1 billion in spending increases. To offset these increases
the Administration indicates it has directed agency heads to reduce

B- 3
spending for other items by $3.5 billion, including the $3 billion cut
previously announced by Defense Secretary Laird. However, recent action
by the House involving appropriations for education would provide nearly
$1 billion above that recommended by the Administration. Senate action
in the area of housing also exceeds Administration requests. In view of
the apparent low estimates for agriculture and possible Congressional
action in various areas, it would appear that further budget cuts by the
Administration will become necessary if outlays are going to be held to
the $192.9 billion level.
The Budget Bureau estimate of receipts for fiscal 1970 includes
about $4 billion dependent upon action not yet taken by Congress. The
Bureau assumes retroactive repeal of the investment tax credit ($1.3 billion),
extension of the tax surcharge through June 1970 at the 5 per cent rate
($2.0 billion) and extension or imposition of certain excise and user
charges ($.7 billion). The presumed enactment of the administration's
tax reform proposal is expected to have no net effect on the total budget
for fiscal 1970.
Most of the $2.2 billion difference between the Budget Bureau
and Board Staff estimates of total receipts for fiscal 1970 involves
estimates of corporate income tax receipts. The Staff forecast assumes
lower corporate profits, especially in the second half of fiscal 1970.
As customary the Summer Budget Review does not go beyond the
current fiscal year and official estimates cannot be expected before the
January Budget. In preparing the Budget Document the administration will
face the expiration of the surtax which at the recommended 7.5 per cent
average for this fiscal year, would yield an estimated $8 billion. Thus,
even with the usual growth in the tax base, total net receipts would not
increase sufficiently to offset large expenditures increases. The recent
Administration proposals on increases in social security benefits would
add $3.5 billion to outlays in fiscal 1971. A partially offsetting social
security tax increase is now scheduled for January 1971. The final
budget outcome for fiscal 1971, of course, will depend heavily on develop-
ments in defense spending.
