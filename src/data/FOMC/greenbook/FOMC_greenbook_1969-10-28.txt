SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK
Outlook for economic activity
Recent developments strongly suggest that real GNP will
grow more slowly this quarter than the 2 per cent annual rate of the
previous two quarters, and a cessation of expansion--or possibly a
small contraction--is in prospect for the first half of next year. In-
dustrial production declined slightly in both August and September, and
with retail sales continuing sluggish into mid-October any near-term
reversal of the recent downrift in output of consumer goods seems un-
likely. In early October, sales of new autos receded from the model-
introduction bulge of late September, and auto manufacturers are re-
ported to be trimming output schedules for late this year. Output
of business equipment has been about level since June.
Most sectors of final demand over the three quarters ahead
appear likely to provide appreciably less support to over-all growth
than thus far this year. Federal defense spending is expected to drop
substantially in line with recent official statements. Only rather
moderate advances are in prospect for State and local spending, in
line with the slowing that occurred last quarter, given the present
tightness in the long-term municipal capital markets and the lags between
financing and expenditures. Recentproduction developments for business
equipment, along with the relatively flat trend in new orders for
over the past years, are broadly consistent with a fairly marked
prospective slowing in growth of plant and equipment outlays, and there

I-2
may well be little or no increase in real terms in the first half of
next year. The increase in housing starts in September largely re-
flected special influences, and declines are likely to be resumed
given continued tightness in financial markets.
Consumer spending is expected to continue to advance at
about the moderate third quarter pace, with higher prices of both
goods and services accounting for most of the increase. Growth in
wages and salaries would be slowed by the anticipated weaker employment
trend, but disposable income will be supported by the reduction in
the surtax to 5 per cent on January 1, and by the sizable increase in
the sizable increase in Social Security benefits assumed to be
effective in the second quarter of 1970. There will be some further
expansive potential in this sector, of course, if the surtax is
eliminated on January 1 and if the rise in Social Security benefits
is larger or comes sooner than assumed.
With projected developments in final demands, incentives for
inventory accumulation will weaken. For a time, however, there may
be some involuntary inventory accumulation until production schedules
are adjusted. We are projecting only a moderate subsequent decline
in the rate of inventory investment, but it must be noted that there
is a distinct possibility of more accumulation early in the period
and a much sharper subsequent decline.

I -3
Outlook for resource use and prices
Key measures of resource use eased in the third quarter and
prospects are for a marked further easing to mid-1970. Industrial
production is now anticipated to show little change--or possibly some
decline--in the current quarter, and further declines are likely in
the first half of next year. With capacity continuing to grow, the
manufacturing capacity utilization rate is projected to fall to as low
as 80 per cent in the second quarter of 1970, from around 84.5 per
cent in the second quarter of this year.
Demand for labor slowed further in the third quarter and,
consistent with the GNP projection, only a modest employment increase--
if any--is expected in the first half of next year. As a result, the
unemployment rate is likely to continue to rise irregularly.
Upward pressures on wage rates have remained strong. Al-
though the calendar of new contract negotiations has been light this
year, union wage rates have continued up weaker contracts negotiated
in earlier years and large pay increases have been granted to non-
union workers. Next year, a much larger number of workers will be
covered in major contract negotiations and wage demands are expected
to be unusually large and consistent. But reduced demands for labor,
a shorter workweek and less overtime pay should dampen somewhat the
increase on average in hourly earnings. Declining profits and profit
margins are likely to make for more management resistence to large
increases in wage rates and for more strikes in key industries than
this year.

I-4
With wage rates still likely to increase fairly rapidly
and with output per manhour unlikely to increase rapidly in the face
of stable or declining output, labor costs per unit of output will
continue to rise. This and efforts to sustain profits will maintain
upward pressure on prices. But we expect price pressures to be
mitigated by the prospective slackening in demands and the easier
resource picture.
On balance, we look for some moderation in the pace of price
increase at both the industrial and consumer levels by mid-1970.
Over the past year, the steep rise in consumer prices has been in
large part attributable to foods and services. For foods, slower
income growth--along with generally ample supplies, except possibly
for pork--is likely to contribute over the next three quarters to a
smaller increase in demands and hence in prices than over the past
year. For services, on the basis of our projection, a leveling off
of mortgage interest rates seems more plausible than further sharp
increases. While prices of some other services may also rise more
slowly, on the whole we cannot expect any marked deceleration in this
broad sector.

I -5
Prospective demands for funds
Business needs for funds will remain relatively large during
the fourth quarter, even if growth in aggregate economic activity shows
further signs of slackening. Inventory expansion is expected to remain
close to the advanced third quarter rate, plant and equipment outlays
are projected to grow further; and corporate profits are being eroded
by rising business costs. Corporate liquidity appears to have declined
substantially in the third quarter, and although a sizable further re-
duction seems likely in the current quarter,needs for external borrowing
will also be large.
The share of business financing requirements being accommodated
through banks may rise somewhat. In particular, hopes that the current
down-trend of bond yields will persist may encourage corporate treasurers
to defer capital market financing and turn in the interim to bank credit
lines and the commercial paper market. While the recent volume of
corporate bond financing has remained quite large, the forward calendar
of issues definitely scheduled is only moderate.
Recent yield declines on municipal bonds have made it possible
for a number of State and local government borrowers previously fore-
closed by rate ceilings to return to the market. With the backlog of
other deferred demands still very large, pressures from such borrowers
are likely to continue to build-up, whenever rate ceilings permit, for
some months ahead. Since several key States have recently raised their

I-6
rate ceilings, larger borrowing demands are now possible even at yields
above 6 per cent. At the same time, in the absence of a change in monetary
policy or regulation Q ceilings, the capacity of commercial banks to buy
municipals will remain very limited. In fact, much of the recent yield
down-turn appears to have reflected repositioning by dealers, rather
than ultimate investor buying. In these circumstances the odds would
thus seem to favor some back-up of municipal yields in the weeks just
ahead.
Over the remainder of the year securities markets will also
have to absorb a sizable volume of U.S. Government and Federal agency
d ebt, though mostly in the shorter-term area. Because Federal cash
spending has failed to taper off as much as anticipated this fall,
fourth quarter Federal cash borrowing is now expected to exceed--by
$2 billion or more--the $5 billion figure suggested as likely by
Treasury spokesmen before the quarter began. In the market for Federal
agency debt there is little prospect for any let up in the volume of
FNMA and FHLBB borrowing. Together these two agencies are expected to
raise possibly another $1.5 billion of new money in November and December
and to need an additional $1 billion in January.
Prospective supply of funds
With no change in monetary policy or regulation Q ceilings,
deposits at commercial banks will probably continue to decline on balance
over the remainder of the year, although at a substantially reduced pace

I -7
compared to recent months. Demand deposits, including Government as well
as private, while fluctuating substantially over the period may show
little net change. Time and savings deposits are likely to decline
further, however, although by less than in the third quarter.
CD runoff has moderated considerably over the past few weeks
as sizable amounts of foreign official accounts have switched from Euro-
dollar deposits in foreign branches of large U.S. banks to domestic CD's
at the home office. While much of this switching was of the one-shot
variety, prompted by changed interest rate relationships associated with
changes in marginal reserve requirements on the two types of deposits,
some inflow of foreign official funds may persist. If so, the continuing
CD attrition may remain at a more moderate rate, particularly since total
monthly maturities of outstanding CD's will at the same time be shrinking.
Consumer-type time and savings deposits are expected to remain vulnerable
to the competition of high rates on market securities. Attrition in such
accounts has been large, as expected, during the October post-interest-
crediting period, but should become smaller again in November and
December.
Deposit pressures on banks in combination with increased loan
demands are likely to encourage further growth of commercial paper issued
through bank holding companies. Much of the fall expansion in such
borrowing to date has reflected the emergence of new issuers, and this
pattern is likely to persist.

I-8
Nonbank thrift institutions also experienced large net savings
losses during the October reinvestment period. While it now seems
likely that their fourth quarter net savings experience will be no
better than that in the third, recent evidence--after rough allowance
for seasonal factors--does not suggest any major further deterioration
either. With expectations generally for significant further savings
attrition early next year, with sizable backlogs of outstanding mortgage
commitments to be worked down, and with lower levels of institutional
liquidity, savings and loan associations and savings banks should,
nevertheless, remain cautious in approving new mortgage commitments
through year-end.
With expectations having already reduced interest rates
substantially, and given the continued restraints anticipated on in-
stitutional supplies of funds, there may be relatively little room for
further significant interest rates declines. Increases in mortgage
interest rates and some back-up in municipal yields seem likely, and
other rates could rise as the economy moves into the last two months
of year when seasonal loan demand pressures peak.
Balance of payments outlook
Preliminary indications of a dip in imports in September,
coupled with maintenance of exports at an advanced level, tend to
support predictions that the current account of the U.S. balance of
payments will show a moderate improvement in coming months. Abroad,
economic activity is continuing to expand. Export orders for U.S.

I-9
machinery showed a further strong rise during the summer. Revaluation
of the German mark is not expected to alter the general prospects for
expansion in world trade. Its effects will help a little to damp down
inflationary pressures in Germany, while moderately stimulating activity
in neighboring countries. To the extent that the German trade surplus
declines, the major benefit will accrue to Germany's EEC trade partners.
There is little basis in recent statistical or other news for
modifying, or for hsarpening, earlier uncertain views on prospective
private capital flows from or to the United States. Liabilities of
U.S. banks to their foreign branches have risen by over $1/2 billion
in the past two and a half weeks, while Euro-dollar interest rates for
terms of one month to a year have dropped sharply--though to a level
that is still exceptionally high, about 9-1/4 per cent.
The decline in Euro-dollar rates from peaks of over 11 per
cent in June and July reduces the cost to U.S. banks of borrowing through
foreign branches by about I percentage point when allowance is made for
the new reserve requirements under Regulation M. In comparison with
reserve-free funds obtainable by large banks for around 8 per cent or
somewhat more in the commercial paper market, the present cost of Euro-
dollars obtained through branches is, however, still high.
The growth to the middle of the month in U.S. banks' takings
as well as the decline in rates continuing since then, probably reflects
an easing in supply and demand for Euro-dollars in Europe. In August

I -10
and early September, the decline in rates had been temporarily reversed
by heavy demand for Euro-dollar credit to hedge against appreciation of
the German mark. Now that the DM rate has risen such demand has no doubt
fallen off, and reflows from the mark have no doubt contributed to Euro-
dollar supplies. Such reflows may continue for a while after the new
DM parity is established, presumably at a level not far from its present
market value. For the months ahead, however, there are no visible
indications that large fresh supplies would be coming into the Euro-
dollar market from other sources, given a continuation of present
Euro-dollar interest rates.

THE ECONOMIC PICTURE IN DETAIL
Domestic Nonfinancial Scene
Gross national product. Gross national product is estimated
to have risen by $17.5 billion in the third quarter, as compared with
an increase of about $16 billion in the second. The larger rise last
quarter reflected the Federal pay raise ($3 billion, annual rate) and
an increase in inventory accumulation of $2.5 billion. Private final
sales (GNP less government purchases and inventory accumulation) rose
$3 billion less than in the second quarter. In real terms, GNP growth
in the third quarter was at an annual rate of 2 per cent, the same as
in the second quarter.
Despite the somewhat faster rise in current dollar GNP, most
sectors of demand continued to weaken during the third quarter, and
there was a perceptible reduction of pressure on resources. A decline
in construction activity, continued sluggishness of retail sales, cur-
tailed Federal spending for defense and a slower growth in State and
local expenditures were reflected in a reduction in industrial output
in the past two months, and some easing in demand for labor. Moreover,
the apparent rise in inventory investment in the third quarter and high
inventory-sales ratios in durables suggest that production is out of
line with demand in some key sectors, and that further adjustments of
output and employment may be in prospect. At the same time, business
capital spending has continued to grow, and there was little evidence
of significant reduction in inflationary pressures.

II -2
The available evidence continues to point to a substantially
smaller increase in GNP in the fourth quarter. There are additional
indications that the Federal government is working hard to hold the
line on spending, and without the effect of the pay raise which in-
creased Federal outlays last quarter, declines in Federal purchases
are likely to resume. State and local expenditures already have been
affected by the limited availability of funds and by high interest
rates. Growth of such spending was $1 billion less in the third
quarter than in the second, and increases are likely to continue to
run well below the $3.5 -4.0 billion average quarterly increase of
the first half of 1969.
Construction activity, as well, is expected to be further
affected by the continued monetary restraint. Investment in residential
structures was down $1.6 billion in the third quarter, and an additional
reduction of $1 billion is expected in the current quarter. The third
quarter drop in housing starts (which lead housing activity) was some-
what less than we had anticipated; the decline in activity was apparently
moderated temporarily by large commitments and efforts of builders to
accelerate starts in the face of tightening money markets and rising
interest rates. But now, with available commitments reduced, the decline
in starts is expected to be sharper this quarter. We are projecting an
annual rate of 1.25 million starts for the current quarter and further
reductions in the first half of next year.

II -3
Business investment continued relatively strong in the third
quarter, but there were indications that the slower growth forecast by
businessmen for the current quarter in the last Commerce-SEC Survey will
be confirmed. The recent leveling off in output of machinery and equip-
ment and the relatively flat trend of new orders this year, despite the
rise in September, suggest a more moderate growth of capital outlays in
the near future.
The outlook for consumer demand remains most in question.
Gains in consumer expenditures slowed in the third quarter despite a
sharp increase in disposable income, and the saving rate rose to
6.4 per cent from 5.3 per cent in the preceding quarter. It would not
be surprising, therefore, if consumption increased somewhat faster in
the fourth quarter, with some decline in the saving rate. But retail
sales so far in October have remained relatively weak. Moreover, with
employment growth and gains in personal income expected to continue to
slow, it is unlikely that increases in consumption in the next few months
will be large enough to offset the waning strength of the government
and business sectors, and a further substantial drop in growth of final
sales appears likely in the current quarter. We expect that production
adjustments will lag the weaker final sales increase, and that inventory
accumulation will continue at about the third quarter rate, but that
more of the additional stock-building will be involuntary.
GNP growth in real terms is likely to come to a halt in the
first half of next year. With money markets continuing under restraint,

II -4
it seems fairly clear that we will see a substantial further reduction
of housing activity early next year, with starts off perhaps to an
annual rate of around 1 million units by the second quarter. Similarly,
growth of State and local government spending is likely to continue to
be limited by the problems of financing in tight capital markets. Some
downward adjustments of business investment plans for 1970 also seem
probable in view of limited availability of funds, high interest rates
and declining profits, particularly if, as we assume, the investment
tax credit is removed by the end of this year.
Disposable income and consumption will get a boost on January 1,
when the surcharge is scheduled to be cut. Our projections assume re-
duction of the tax to 5 per cent for the first half of 1970, which adds
about $4.4 billion (annual rate) to disposable income in the first
quarter; elimination of the surcharge entirely would double the amount.
A further lift to disposable income is expected in the second quarter
when a proposed increase in Social Security benefits could add another
$3 billion. But these increases in disposable income are likely to
be moderated by slower growth of employment and cuts in the workweek.
Thus, we expect that increases in consumption will be moderate in the
first half of 1970, and that the saving rate will be only slightly
below the third quarter.
The rate of inventory accumulation should slow markedly as
businessmen adjust their production schedules to the reduced growth
of final sales. Under such conditions, real GNP is expected to show

virtually no growth, or to decline slightly, in the first half of next
year. As pressures on resources ease, the rate of increase in the GNP
deflator is likely to slow somewhat; we are projecting a rate of in-
crease of under 3-1/2 per cent by the second quarter.
Industrial production. Industrial production in September
dipped 0.3 per cent further to 173.8 per cent of the 1957-59 average.
The decline, as in August, was due in part to special factors. Auto
assemblies, largely because of strikes, declined 5 per cent
from an annual rate of 9.1 million units in August to 8.7 million
units in September. While production schedules for October were set
at a 9.0 million unit rate, some strikes have continued so far this
month. The drop in autos plus declines in industrial chemicals
(essentially synthetic fibers), coal, crude oil, and residential
electricity accounted for the easing in the total index, as output
of business equipment and most other industrial materials was about
unchanged.
The turn around in industrial production from an increase
of 3.2 per cent from January to July, to a decline of 0.5 per cent
from July to September is fairly abrupt. The extent of the recent
decline, however, is considerably less than in the first two months
of the 1967 "mini-recession" and the relatively sharp recession in
1958. In the 1967 slowdown, the decline was preceeded by 3 months of
leveling out and in 1957 by 11 months of little change.

The outlook for industrial production in the fourth quarter is
for further declines, probably at a somewhat accelerated rate. Pro-
duction schedules for autos, if met, call for a reduction from a 9.0
million unit rate in October to 8.2 million in December. With consumer
demand continuing sluggish, some further cutback in output of consumer
goods is probable. Production of business equipment is likely to show
little change from current levels and output of defense equipment to
continue to decline. Under these conditions, demand for and production
of industrial materials should weaken.
Retail sales. Despite a strong pickup in the automotive
group, retail sales in September and the first two weeks in October
suggest that consumers have continued to exercise the moderation in
spending which has been evident since last fall. Even though total
retail sales in September rose almost 1 per cent from August, accord-
ing to present data this only brought the level 2.4 per cent above
January and 3 per cent above a year earlier. Sales in the first two

II -7
weeks in October were only about 2-1/2 per cent above a year earlier.
In real terms, October may be the fifth consecutive month that sales
have been below 1968 levels.
Sales at durable goods stores rose 3 per cent from August,
as the automotive group increased 4.6 per cent and furniture and
appliance sales rose 1.3 per cent. Part of the strength in new car
sales is probably attributable to larger than normal fleet purchases,
but the importance of fleet sales will not be known for some weeks.
Sales at nondurable goods stores on average were unchanged from
August, although sales at department stores declined for the second
month.
Next month the Census Bureau plans to revise its seasonal
factor for the automotive group of stores. The new seasonal factors
are expected to lower automotive sales in the first part of the year
and increase the level in recent months.
Sales of new domestic autos in the first 10 days of October
were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 8.5 million units, 4 per
cent above the first 10 days of September, but 11 per cent below a
year earlier. The early October sales represent a sharp drop from the
final 10 days of September when introductions of new models resulted
in record sales.
Stocks of new autos on October 10 totaled 1.4 million units
(not seasonally adjusted), 3 per cent above 10 days earlier and 12 per
cent above a year earlier.

Sales of used cars for the month of September were 6 per cent
more than in August, seasonally adjusted, and 4 per cent above last
year Auction prices of used cars in September were up 3 per cent from
August.

Consumer credit. Consumer instalment credit outstanding
increased at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $7.3 billion in the
July-August period, compared with $9 billion in the first half of 1969.
The smaller rise in recent months is attributable to a marked reduction
in growth of auto credit--from a $2.9 billion rate in the first half
of the year to $1.1 billion this summer.
Auto credit developments have largely reflected variations in
unit sales, product mix, and prices; there have been no significant

increase in maturities. As compared to a year or two earlier, both sales
finance companies and commercial banks are writing somewhat higher pro-
portions of their new car contracts for amounts in excess of the dealer
cost of the unit financed.

Inventories. The rate of inventory accumulation dropped in
August at both manufacturing and trade establishments. In part this--

II -10
reflected a substantial drop in inventories at wholesalers, reportedly
in part associated with shipments of cotton abroad under Public Law 480.
Accumulation slowed substantially at manufacturers and was somewhat
reduced at retail establishments.

The OBE preliminary estimate of a $9.4 billion rate increase
in inventories (after valuation adjustment) in the third quarter implies
a return in September to around the July rate of book value increase.
The estimated third-quarter rate of accumulation could not be long
sustained without a considerable increase in orders and sales. Unless
this occurs, a slowdown in inventory investment by the turn of the year
is likely.

The over-all inventory-sales ratio declined in August, mainly
because of the drop in wholesale inventories combined with the associated
rise in sales. The retail ratio also declined, but the decline was
mainly at food and other staples stores; stocks rose relative to sales
at automotive dealers and at G.A.F. stores.
The trade inventory-sales ratio has flucturated in a rather
narrow band since late 1966; it is high by the standards of 1962-65,
but has not shown in recent months the kind of sustained upward move-
ment that preceded the 1960 downturn or the 1966 slowdown. It is not a
very consistent leading indicator, however; at mid-1957 it had been
fluctuating around 1.35, with a downward tendency, for a year and a
half. The manufacturing durable goods inventory-backlog ratio, whose

II -12
rise signaled past recessions and the 1967 slowdown with leads ranging
from 3 to 11 months, rose in August for the fourth month.
Residential construction and real estate. Seasonally adjusted
private housing starts, which were revised upward to show a slight rise
for August, increased a tenth further in September to an annual rate of
1.52 million units. While the September rate was the highest since April,
like the greater than expected month-to-month drop initially reported
for July, it can be largely discounted on the basis of special seasonal
adjustment problems and other factors typically associated with the
monthly series. Concentrating on the quarterly series--a much more
reliable indicator of trend--starts in the third quarter were at an
annual rate of 1.42 million, down 6 per cent from the second quarter
rate and 17 per cent below the recent peak reached in the first
quarter of the year.
Based on the third quarter averages, the downtrend continued
to be less pronounced for multifamily units than for single-family units,
as shown in the table, reflecting in part the greater willingness and
ability of multifamily builders to compete for funds in this year's
increasingly stringent credit markets. Regionally, starts moved counter
to the general decline only in the North Central states where an upward
adjustment in usury ceilings had helped to produce a short-lived spurt
in starts earlier in the third quarter. In the Northeast, where usury
ceilings have become a particularly limiting factor, starts showed by

II -13
far the greatest further drop and were the lowest since the fourth
quarter of 1966.

Some acceleration in the starts decline is expected during the
current quarter in view of the further attrition indicated in outstanding
mortgage commitments in recent months and the persistent reduction in
building permits since April. Even so, the seasonally adjusted average
for the quarter as a whole may hold at least somewhat above a 1.2 million
annual rate. A lower average than that appears unlikely given the fact
that unadjusted starts normally show a sharp seasonal drop after October,
and considering the probability that, under presently reduced housing-
supply conditions, builders with commitments may continue efforts to move
ahead of normal schedules.

II 13A
New orders. The Greenbook Supplement will carry a more detailed
account of manufacturers' new orders of durable goods in September, but
the major results are as follows:
1. Such orders rose 5.9 per cent from August to a new high.
2. Increases were widespread, with a decline in defense
orders a major exception.
3. The most striking development was an increase of 17 per
cent in orders for machinery and equipment. Orders for nonelectrical
machinery were up 10 per cent while orders in the "other" subgroup of
transportation equipment rose 78 per cent, primarily reflecting, to
our present knowledge, an upsurge for ships, Orders for electrical
machinery were off slightly.
4. For the third quarter as a whole, total durable goods
orders were up about 4 per cent from the second quarter, but orders
for machinery and equipment did not quite equal the volume of the
preceding quarter.
5. Shipments were up about 2.5 per cent and unfilled orders
returned to close to their high earlier in the summer. For machinery
and equipment, backlogs did advance to a new high.

II -14
Labor market. The labor market has eased in recent months
from the extremely tight situation that prevailed last winter, and a
further weakening appears likely. Employment growth has slowed measur-
ably and, as demands for labor tapered off, the unemployment rate moved
up from 3.3 per cent in the first quarter to 3.7 per cent in the third.
Unemployment rates for most groups showed relatively steady increases
after the end of the first quarter with the rate for men in prime working
ages (25 years and over), edging up from 1.5 per cent in February to
1.9 per cent in September. Claims for unemployment insurance, reflect-
ing the rise in joblessness among covered workers, have risen slowly
since spring and in the most recent four-week period averaged about
5 per cent higher than a year earlier.
Nonfarm employment rose by only 100,000 over the three months
ending in September. Limits on Federal expenditures resulted in a
decline in Federal employment between June and September, while con-
struction employment edged down in response to reduced residential
building. Further declines are anticipated in these two sectors.
State and local government employment also declined slightly, but
advances are likely in the months ahead.

In manufacturing, employment increased at a relatively steady
pace, with the bulk of the rise occurring in the five major metal-pro-
ducing and metal-using industries. In the construction-related and non-
durable goods categories employment has shown no increase over the last
six months. In defense-related manufacturing industries, employment
declined slightly over the period with the largest decline in ordnance.
Growth of total wage and salaries averaged $3.5 billion per
month over the summer--only slightly less than in the early part of the
year. But the Federal oay raise accounted for about one-fourth of the
average monthly rise, while the growth rate of private wages and
salaries fell off sharply in nonmanufacturing industries. This pattern
was in line with the markedly slower growth of employment in these in-
dustries. On the other hand, manufacturing payrolls have continued to
expand steadily. Proprietors' income stayed level this summer after
rising strongly in the March to June period, while income from such
sources as rent, interest and dividends continued to increase.

II -16
Personal income increased only $2.3 billion in September
compared to $6.1 billion in August. But the disparity in the two
changes reflects in large part a temporary situation in autos, where
the early model changeover probably had the effect of advancing some
of the payroll rise in this industry into August.

Industrial relations. In the first of a major round of important
collective bargaining negotiations--which will also include the railroad,
trucking, rubber, and auto industries--negotiations appear to have reached
a stalemate at General Electric. The first company offer was rejected
and it appears likely that the workers will strike after the current
contract expires October 26. In addition to improved fringe benefits,
the company had offered a 6 per cent across-the-board first-year wage
increase and reopenings on wages in the second and third contract years.

II -17
Skilled workers were offered an additional 5 to 25 cent increase in the
first year. The company's offer came far from meeting the union's wage
demands which average close to 10 per cent per annum over a 2-1/2 year
contract term, and include an additional 50 cent first year increase
for skilled workers.
Negotiations at American Motors with 10,000 members of the
UAW did not result in settlement before the old contract expired and
the workers went on strike October 16. The main economic issues have
been decided and workers will vote on a package which provides an 8 per
cent increase in wages and benefits as soon as the negotiators clean up
a variety of local plant issues. The threatened strike of 120,000 members
of shopcraft unions against seven major railroads on October 4 was averted
for 60 days by the President's appointment of an Emergency Board. The
unions are seeking a substantial wage increase retroactive to January 1,
1969.
Wholesale prices. Average wholesale prices of all commodities
this past quarter rose at a substantially slower pace than in the previous
two quarters, as may be seen in the table. But this deceleration in the
over-all average blurs two important developments: (1) a faster rise in
average industrial prices, which was largely offset by (2) a decline in
prices of foods and foodstuffs following an extraordinarily sharp spring
increase. These recent gyrations in farm and food prices are attributable
to a very rapid run-up in livestock and meats and a subsequent easing. So

II -18
far as industrial commodities are concerned, price increases in the
third quarter were widespread. Particularly important were large
advances in prices of steel mill products and nonferrous metals. An
important exception was lumber and plywood, for which substantial
price declines continued but far smaller than in the spring.

Wholesale prices rose 0.2 per cent from mid-August to mid-
September, 0.1 percentage point more than the original BLS estimate.
Industrial commodity prices increased 0.4 per cent, somewhat more than
estimated earlier, as prices for more than one-half of the industrial
product classes advanced, but prices of farm and food products declined
0.3 per cent and held down the increase in the total index.

II -19
Price increases for metals--especially nonferrous--accounted for
about one-half of the increase in industrial prices last month. Increases
in prices of machinery and equipment were at the fastest rate since
November 1966 and were responsible for about one-fourth of the over-all
rise. But sizable price increases were also registered for other commodities,
including apparel and some paper products. Prices of lumber declined for
the fifth consecutive month, but plywood rose for the first time since
March.
Since mid-September, price increases have been announced for a
variety of commodities, including steel mill products, chemicals, aluminum
ingot and mill products, autos, tires, and major home appliances. Prices
of steel scrap declined during this period as ample supplies interacted
with reduced demand by steel mills.
Livestock prices dropped sharply from mid-August to mid-
September and were primarily responsible for the decline in prices of
farm and food products. Livestock prices are now at about the mid-
September level. Prices for meats were also lower over the month to
mid-September, and declined further in the latter part of the month.
Consumer prices. Despite a sharp rise in September consumer
prices rose somewhat less rapidly in the quarter just ended than in the
second quarter, mainly because food prices were up significantly less.
Also, prices of new and used autos declined. Prices of other durable
goods continued to rise. The rate of advance in service prices

II -20
accelerated somewhat, despite a less rapid rise in mortgage rates.
The third quarter increase was also smaller than in the first quarter,
mainly because of an exceptionally large rise in used car prices which
raised significantly the first quarter average. Most major groups
except some services, increased more rapidly than in the first quarter.
From August to September consumer prices advanced at an annual
rate of about 6 per cent, somewhat more than for the third quarter as a
whole. Food prices rose only a little, but after allowance for seasonal
influences the increase was considerable. There were sharp advances in
the price of meats and in the cost of restaurant meals. Fruit and
vegetable prices dropped less than seasonally.
Apparel prices rose markedly in September, with only part of
the increase reflecting the usual seasonal influences. Prices of both
new and used cars fell prior to the introduction of new models. The
cost of consumer services continued to rise rapidly, with further
advances in mortgage interest rates, household services, and medical
care.

Farm income and production prospects. Farmers' net realized
incomes averaged $1.1 billion above a year earlier (seasonally adjusted
annual rate) during the first three quarters of 1969, and the year
promises to be the most profitable for farmers since 1966. The major
factor in this gain through the third quarter was a sharp rise in
prices of livestock products in response to a leveling out in market-
ings. The margin over a year ago in net income may narrow in the
fourth quarter as prices of crops, and possibly broilers, sag under
the impact of heavy marketings but prices of most livestock products
are expected to continue strong.

With crops largely matured, total crop output about 1 per cent
above last year's record was virtually assured by October 1 conditions.
Shifts in prospects during September were largely offsetting with
deterioration in cotton balanced by general improvement in feed crops
and soybeans. Since the October 1 survey, a severe freeze extending
to the Texas Panhandle has hurt some crops, but this damage is not likely
to reduce national output prospects.
Cotton crop prospects are down to 10.5 million bales, about
one-half million bales below expected use, but prices are likely to hold
stable because trade stocks are large, demand is down, and next year's

II -23
program calls for a big increase in acreage. Plentiful supplies of
vegetables and fruits, items accounting for more than a fifth of consumer
food budgets, were in prospect on October 1.
In the fourth quarter red meat production is expected to equal
that of a year earlier, with expansion in beef offset by declining veal
and lamb output and by a sharp cut in pork if the predicted cutback in
hog marketings materializes. Production of milk and poultry products,
especially broiler and turkey meat, is expected to exceed a year
earlier. These trends are likely to extend into the first quarter
of 1970 with pork output down sharply at least through January. A
survey released on October 17 showed 10 per cent more cattle on feed-
lots than a year earlier, substantiating earlier indications of large
marketings of fed cattle throughout the fall and also suggesting that
large marketings may continue in the January-March period.

THE ECONOMIC PICTURE IN DETAIL
Domestic Financial Situation
Bank credit. Commercial bank credit declined moderately in
September as a comparatively sharp drop in holdings of U.S. Treasury
securities more than offset a fairly strong rise in total loans and a
modest increase in other investment holdings. Weekly reporting bank
data suggest that bank credit leveled out during late September and the
early part of October as further growth in loans about matched invest-
ment reductions. It may then have increased to some extent as banks
acquired a larger proportion of the TAB's issued by the Treasury on
October 14, for which 50 per cent of payment could take the form of
credit to tax and loan accounts.

Although the September advance in total loans was somewhat
stronger than recorded in the summer months, the advance was fairly wide-
spread--gains being recorded in all major loan categories except loans
to nonbank financing institutions--and there was no strong rise in any
specific loan category. Real estate loans did advance more than in any
month since May, but much of this increase was due to loan reclassifica-
tion.
Business loans increased in September at a pace just slightly
below that established during the summer months. Toward the end of
September and in early October, however, business lending at weekly
reporting banks accelerated somewhat. Loans to producers of metal and
metal products continued to expand at a relatively rapid pace, and there
was additional borrowing recently associated with final payments on
Alaskan oil leases. Loans to firms engaged in wholesale and retail
trade, on the other hand, were about normal for this time of year and
loan extensions to firms in the petroleum industry and chemical industry
were below normal.
The September decline in U.S. Treasury holdings mainly reflected
bank distribution of securities acquired in the Treasury's late August
financing. Weekly reporting bank data indicate that liquidation of Treasury
issues continued on into the early part of October and that prior to the
October 14 financing, bank holdings of Treasury securities had dropped below
their late August level. The September run-off of Treasury securities was
offset to some extent by a temporary increase in holdings of other securities.
This increase largely reflected New York bank underwriting of a mid-September

The outflow of large CD's continued in recent weeks, but the
rate has diminished considerably. Large CD purchases by the Bank for
International Settlements from the head offices of several large banks
partly offset the continued sharp rundown of CD's held by other customers
of the banks. Excluding BIS and other foreign official deposits, CD's
declined by about $400 to $500 million over the three weeks ending
October 15. This is approximately in line with the attrition rate pre-
vailing since the latter part of the summer.
After tapering off in September, attrition on consumer-type
time and savings deposits resumed in the weeks following the October
quarterly interest crediting. However, data through the week ending
October 8 suggest that, although interest yields on most market instruments

III -6
recently have been higher than in July, attrition in the present period
is substantially below that in July, presumably because not as many banks
credit savings accounts on a quarterly basis. Total consumer-type time
and savings deposits, including the amounts of interest credited, showed
a slight increase for the two weeks ending October 8 which compares with
a $260 million decline in the similar two-week period following the
interest crediting in the middle of this year. However, the recent
deposit movement contrasts with the gain of more than $600 million
recorded last year in the corresponding weeks of October.
As for nondeposit sources of funds, in recent weeks commer-
cial banks have tapped the Euro-dollar market for additional funds and
borrowing by bank affiliates in the commercial paper market has also
stepped up. These increased borrowings have more than offset further
declines in loan RP's, which dropped nearly $800 million from their
mid-July peak of $1.3 billion.

Nonbank depositary intermediaries. Outflows of savings (net
of interest credited) from both savings and loans and savings banks
during the current reinvestment period were sizable, as had been expected.
But these current outflows do not appear to indicate any marked further
weakening from the June-July period, bearing in mind the difference in
seasonal forces. As in the mid-year interest crediting period, outflows
from savings banks were much larger than in 1966, but in that earlier
period mid-year increases in offering rates had been effective in
limiting outflows throughout the second half of the year. For savings
and loans, outflows were a smaller share of outstanding deposits during
the latest investment period, as compared to that in 1966. For the
third quarter as a whole, the seasonally adjusted annual rate of growth
in both types of accounts continued to fall and at two per cent was the
lowest since the second quarter of 1966.

Although mortgage lending of savings and loans declined on a
seasonally adjusted basis in the third quarter, such lending was as
large as a year ago, despite the pressure on savings, sustained by heavy
reliance on FHLB advances. The FHLBB has endeavored to support the home
mortgage market this year by maintaining an expansive policy with regard
to advances and, to a lesser extent, by relaxing requirements for S&L
liquid asset holdings. During the third quarter alone, the net amount
of funds borrowed by S&Ls was $1.5 billion, much more than the $200
million in actual outflows of savings (i.e., not seasonally adjusted)
during the same period. Indeed, through the first three quarters of
1969, the increase in borrowed funds nearly matched the $3.1 billion
savings inflow, and exceeded by far the support received from FHLB
advances in earlier years.Both

Life insurance companies. Policy loans extended by life
insurance companies remained large during the third quarter. Although
the net extensions tended to taper off slightly during August and
September, these loans probably continued to absorb about 15 per cent
of funds invested during the quarter. With large policy loan volume
expected to persist, industry projections of funds available for invest-
ment are being held at modest levels. Sales of securities from portfolio
will probably remain an important supplementary source of funds for
disbursements under existing commitments.

The volume of new investment commitments has decreased
sharply recently, reflecting historically very large backlogs of out-
standing commitments and endeavors to maintain cushions between scheduled
disbursements and reduced projected fund flows. In August, for the first
time this year, new commitments made for both securities and mortgages
was appreciably below the rate of a year earlier. There are early indi-
cations that this reduced pace in commitment activity continued in
September,at least in direct placements.

Mortgage market. With savings inflows at thrift institutions
continuing very limited, the availability of new commitments for resi-
dential mortgages remained tight in early October, despite sustained
support from FNMA. In the secondary market, the scarcity of funds from
private lenders was reflected in additional increases in yields in
FNMA's weekly auction of FHA and VA home loan commitments. By the
October 20 auction, yields averaged 37 basis points above their recent
low in late July, In the latest two auctions, yields rose even though
there was a decline in the volume of bids submitted for FNMA's forward-
purchase commitments. The decline stemmed in part from the increasingly
restrictive discounts on these Government underwritten mortgages.

During September, average contract interest rates and yields
moved slightly higher in both the primary and secondary home-mortgage
market, although the increase continued to be limited by usury ceilings
of 8 per cent or less still prevailing in more than 20 states. Region-
ally, year-over-year increases in contract rates on conventional new-home
mortgages have been largest in the Southwest and West, where usury
ceilings tend to be most liberal. They have been smallest in the North-
east and Middle Atlantic regions, where statutory limits in a number of
important states have been quite restrictive. A few of these ceilings
may be raised after the November elections.

e/ Estimated.
With savings flows at a reduced pace in the third quarter
and uncertain prospects about the current quarter, seasonally adjusted
new mortgage commitments approved by insured savings and loan associa-
tions declined somewhat further in the July-September period, and S&L
commitment backlogs dropped to the lowest level in a year. For both

III -16
new and outstanding S&L commitments, however, the declines experienced
so far in 1969 have been substantially less than in 1966, Unlike 1966,
moreover, a sharp step-up in FNMA's commitment activity has more than
offset the declines indicated for S&L's.
During the July-September period, seasonally adjusted net
expansion in total mortgage debt outstanding, while relatively high,
edged down for the third consecutive quarter, reaching a level about
15 per cent below the record pace attained late last year. Across-the-
board reductions in net mortgage lending on home, income, and farm
properties alike apparently reflected quarter-to-quarter cutbacks by
all major types of private lenders. These cutbacks were only partly
counterbalanced by further substantial increases in net loan acquisitions
by federal agencies, including record net takings by FNMA.
Corporate security and State and local bond markets. A shift
in market expectations in early October produced relatively sharp
declines in corporate and municipal bond yields. And, while stock
prices did not break out of the narrow band prevailing during the summer
and early fall, at mid-month they rose substantially on a very large
volume, with institutional purchases reported to be extremely high.
Apparently, all security markets were influenced by a growing feeling
that some breakthrough in Vietnam peace negotiations might be announced
by the President in his speech scheduled for November 3 and also by some
further indications that the business outlook was weakening and pressure
in the money and credit markets might soon be subsiding. The tax-exempt
bond market also reacted favorably to the Senate Finance Committee deci-
sion reversing House action that would have taxed interest on municipal bonds.

With long-term municipal yields declining and State interest
rate ceilings raised or removed in some areas, short-term financing by
State and local governments appears to have declined contra-seasonally
and long-term tax-exempt offerings are likely to rise sharply in October
to an estimated $1.2 billion, about 50 per cent above the third quarter
average. For November, the staff expects the volume of long-term
municipal offerings to decline somewhat, despite the very large backlog
of financing by State and local governments and the change in rate
ceilings in some areas. This assumes that, on the demand side, the
major buyers of tax-exempt bonds--commercial banks--will remain under

III -18
pressure and will be unable to increase their purchases of municipals
significantly. Moreover, it is reported that inter-dealer transactions
have contributed significantly to the decline in tax-exempt yields.
With continued absence of bank demand and a high volume of new offerings,
dealers may become increasingly reluctant to absorb additional inventory.
If the decline in yields is reversed, as suggested by these considerations,
a drop-off in new offerings might again be forced by statutory interest
ceilings.

In the corporate market, public bond offerings in October are
expected to match the high September pace, although the present forward
calendar suggests that some moderation is likely in November. The
marked improvement in market sentiment, referred to above, has produced

generally quick distribution of new and older issues still in syndicate;
in the secondary market, prices have risen from 1 tb 4 points since
early October. Market demands are reported to center among State and
local pension funds--which had been hesitant to make commitments last
month--although individuals were also said to be continuing to absorb
relatively large quantitites of corporate bonds.

While private placements of bonds are expected to remain
at about the summer pace in October and November, stock offerings are
expected to decline from the rate of September, when several large
public utility issues had been marketed. No large issues are now
scheduled, but a continued uptrend in the stock market could well stimu-
late additional offerings of equities. At this time, the staff's best
estimate suggests that total corporate security issues in October and

III -20
November may remain fairly close to the $2.1 billion average monthly
rate of the third quarter.
Under present circumstances, these projections of underwriting
volume appear subject to unusually wide margins of error. If borrowers
expect yields to continue to decline, bond offerings could drop sharply
in the near-term. On the other hand, with corporate liquidity expected
to decline further and bank credit availability very tight, corporations
might be encouraged to accelerate their capital market demands. This
would most likely occur if market expectations were to be reversed once
more, by either Vietnam developments or public statements regarding the
policy outlook.

III -21
Government securities market. The rally in the market
for U.S. Government notes and bonds, which began in the first week
of October, has continued to date under the impetus of additional
indications of a cooling in economic activity and renewed optimism
on the possibility of a peace breakthrough in Viet Nam. Yields on
intermediate-term issues have fallen by around 85 basis points since
the first of the month and long-term yields have declined by about
60 basis points. While not moving as sharply, Treasury bill rates
also have declined on balance and are now down, mostly 10 to 35 basis
points.

Improvement in the coupon-bearing sector was sparked initially
by a.pick-up in distribution of the securities involved in the Treasury's
September financing following purchases by the Federal Reserve and

III -22
Treasury investment accounts early in October. With the technical
position of the market thus improved, the news of the increase in the
unemployment rate to 4 per cent provided impetus for a rally. As
yields have moved markedly lower, a growing number of market partici-
pants have apparently come to the conclusion that the peak in interest
rates may have been passed, with the result that demands for securities
have remained buoyant in a rising market, as evident in the decline
in dealers' positions in coupon issues.
The Treasury bill market has been in a good technical posi-
tion in the last several weeks, partly due to the effect of heavy
buying by foreign accounts in late September. Although much of this
buying has since been reversed, a large proportion of foreign account
sales so far this month have been absorbed directly by the System as
part of its reserve supplying operations. Thus, the market has remained
technically strong and was able to absorb with little rate effect the
$2 billion of April tax bills auctioned on October 8. More recently
there has been a continuing steady demand for bills, allowing fairly
easy distribution of dealers' weekly awards with little or no upward
rate pressures. The net increase in dealer inventories in bills due
in over 3 months since early October has reflected in part positioning
of the tax bills as banks sold some of their awards to dealers.
Nonetheless, with the bill market in a generally strong, technical
position, the Treasury's announcement of a further $3 billion tax
bill auction on October 23 had little or no effect on rates.

Other Short-Term Credit Markets. In line with developments
in the Government securities market, rate pressures on private short-
term credit instruments generally eased during the first half of
October. Three-month commercial paper declined about 40 basis points
by mid-month to a level of around 8-5/8 per cent, and rates for bankers'
acceptances held at their early October levels. Rates on 3- and 6-month
finance paper, however, moved about 1/8 point higher, probably largely
reflecting seasonal influences associated with introduction of the new
automobile models.
Along with other short-term rates, yields in the short-term
Agency market also showed substantial declines during the first half
of October. Issues due within 3 months declined about 50 basis points,
while other issues due within one year showed average declines of about
15 basis points. Rates on maturities beyond one year have shown
larger declines, as evidenced by the substantial drops in yields on
new issues. For example, on October 2 the 16-month FNMA notes were
offered at 8.70 per cent, whereas the 13-month FHLB notes offered on
October 15 yielded 8.20 per cent. A total of $1.9 billion of Agency
debt was issued in the first half of October, $1.2 billion of which
represented new money. This volume of new money already raised in
October equals the year's record high June figure. (See Appendix A
for further details).

NOTE: The latest figures available on commercial and finance
company paper outstanding are for August. During August, the volume of
such paper rose to a seasonally adjusted annual level of $28.9 billion,
4 per cent above July and 43 per cent above August 1968. About
one-third of the $1 billion increase during the month of August was
accounted for by "bank related" paper issued by bank holding companies,
affiliates of bank holding companies, or affiliates of banks.

Federal Finance. The Staff is continuing to project the
fiscal 1970 budget surplus at about $3.5 billion, considerably
below the $5.9 billion Administration estimate. This $2.4 billion
difference is accounted for by the Staff's projection of lower
receipts that results from our assumption of more sluggish economic
growth than was assumed in the Administration estimates. Thus, the
smaller surplus projected here does not imply a discretionary shift
to a less rectrictive fiscal policy, but rather the automatic effect
on revenues of a projected decline in corporate profits and slower
growth in personal income.
The receipts projection assumes that the surtax will be
extended at 5 per cent through June 1970. While the Senate Finance
Committee recently voted to support the Administration and affirm
the House decision on the surtax extension, the future of this
extension is still uncertain, linked as it is to the tax reform bill
that may still be stopped by either the full Senate or the President.
On the outlays side, the staff has used the official estimate
of $192.9 billion; however, evidence is accumulating that it will take
an unusual struggle by the Administration to keep to this fiscal year
total. Budget Director Mayo mentioned in his October 7 statement
that an additional $4 billion in outlays could result from
Congressional action and inaction not considered in last month's
Summer Budget Review. Military and civilian pay raises as passed

III -28
in the House would add $1.5 billion to planned spending this fiscal
year, but a veto has been threatened if this bill clears both Houses.
Increased veterans benefits, larger outlays by the departments of
Labor and HEW, and a more liberal Food Stamp program could add another
$1.6 billion to the Administration's figure. Other small program
changes might cost almost $1 billion. The Administration's determina-
tion to offset such increases with budget cuts of comparable magnitude--
probably concentrated in defense--might be generally successful, but
spending must be slowed substantially from its third quarter rate to
keep outlays down to $192.9 billion.
The unusually high expenditures so far in this fiscal year
are revealed much more sharply in the Treasury's cash accounts than
in the third quarter NIA estimates. Cash withdrawals to date- by
the Commodity Credit Corporation are up almost $1 billion from the
corresponding period last year, and other nondefense outlays are
up $6 billion. Military cash spending has, however, been moderate,
up only $.5 billion from the same period last year. In all, cash
outlays to date have increased 12 per cent over last year, compared
to a planned increase of 4.4 per cent for the entire fiscal year.
The Treasury has announced an October 23 auction of $3.0
billion of June tax bills for payment October 29. With this
new money in addition to the $2.0 billion of April tax bills sold
earlier this month, the Treasury cash balance should be $6,0 billion
at the end of the month. According to staff estimates another $2 to

III -29
$2-1/2 billion of new cash will probably have to be raised during
November and December to maintain the cash balance above the minimal
$2 billion through its seasonal low in mid- December. Thus total
fourth quarter gross financing of $7 to $7-1/2 billion would be
well above the $6 billion expected earlier and, given the Staff
projection of receipts and expenditures, would yield an end-of-year
balance of around $6 billion.

THE ECONOMIC PICTURE IN DETAIL
International Developments
Foreign Exchange Market. The experiment since September 30 of
floating the German mark exchange rate to a promised but still unspecified
new parity has been accompanied by generally orderly conditions in exchange
markets. During the first week of the floating arrangement, the mark rate
moved -- at its highest point -- to a level about 6.4 per cent above par.
The further rise during the past two weeks has been much slower, and at
its current level of 26.84 cents (October 22) the mark exchange rate is
about 7.4 per cent above par. The Bundesbank has lifted its support
point for the mark in line with the rising market rate to prevent any
significant reversal. Since September 30 it has sold slightly more than
$1 billion, about 60 per cent of its $1.7 billion of spot purchases in
September prior to allowing the mark rate to float.
Currently attention is focused on Monday, October 27, as the
most likely date for a new DM par value to become effective. German
authorities have scheduled a meeting with the EEC Monetary Commission
on Saturday, October 25, for consultation on the new par, which then
will be announced -- observers speculate -- during that weekend. The
German Government suspended the 4 per cent border tax adjustment from
October 11 until December 1. For exports and imports of nonagricultural
goods this had the effect of offsetting over one-half of the mark's
upward revaluation in the market to date.

IV -2
Demand for sterling has been generally strong since October 1,
perhaps in part reflecting the favorable impact of the mark appreciation
and in part reflecting the favorable impact on market sentiment of the
September trade surplus announced at mid-October. There was also fairly
sizable demand from oil companies with royalty payments to make at the
end of the month. The pound rate climbed to a high of $2.3930 -- the
first time it has been above $2.39 since late July -- and the Bank of
England has been able to purchase about $350 million in the market since
the beginning of the month.
Demand for the Dutch guilder, Swiss franc, and Belgian franc
has been strong during the past three weeks. For the guilder and Swiss
franc this strength may possibly be explained by a combination of three
factors: (1) tighter money market conditions in these countries leading
to repatriation of assets held abroad, (2) some reflow of speculative
funds from marks, and (3) perhaps some flow of funds speculating on
possible revaluations of these currencies. The sharp turnaround in
the Belgian franc market was reflected in a movement of the franc rate
from its lower limit to above par -- the first time it has been this
high in 14 months. The Dutch, Swiss and Belgian central banks purchased
large amounts of foreign exchange in the period October 1-22; $410 million,
$110 million and $130 million respectively.
The mark appreciation also apparently moderated selling pressure
against the Italian lira and the French franc, although the lira continues

IV -3
to suffer from a tenacious capital outflow and the French franc from an
imbalance in trade and service payments. The lira exchange rate has
hovered at its lower limit during most of the past three weeks. However,
during the past three trading days (October 20-22) demand for the lira
has increased sharply and the exchange rate has moved up almost to par.
The French franc rate dropped to a new post-devaluation low about mid-
October but more recently has recouped some of this loss. Throughout
the month to date both the Italian and French central banks have continued
to lose dollars through market intervention but on a smaller scale than
during September.
The price of gold fell from $40.75 an ounce (the London fixing
price) on October 1 to $40.25 on October 22, its lowest price during the
year to date.
Euro-dollar market. Euro-dollar interest rates -- particularly
for maturities of three-months and longer -- have declined markedly
since early October. As of October 22, rates on deposits with maturities
ranging from one to twelve months were at their lowest levels since May
of this year. The three-month deposit rate, for example, was 9.19 per
cent per annum on October 22, down almost 2 per cent from its average of
11.08 per cent in the week ending October 1. Rates for shorter-dated
(call and one-month) funds have declined by about 1 per cent since the
first of the month.
Perhaps the most significant influence on the market in recent
weeks has been the situation of the German mark. The virtual certainty
of a change in the mark parity and its de facto revaluation in the market

IV -4
have resulted in a sizable reflow of funds from marks, contributing to
a Bundesbank reserve decline of over $1 billion since the end of
September. Though much of this reduction went to restore the reserve
positions of other central banks, some part of this reflow has probably
been reflected either in an increased demand for Euro-dollar deposits or
the paying off of borrowings of Euro-dollars made to finance mark pur-
chases prior to the German elections. Moreover, the mark appreciation
has probably contributed to an easing of Euro-dollar rates by removing
the risk that the Euro-dollar market would feel the pressures of yet
another speculative flow of funds to Germany in the near future.
In addition to the above factors, the apparent shift in recent
weeks in market expectations about the future course of interest rates
in the United States may also have had some influence. A widespread
belief that U.S. rates will ease during the foreseeable future would
certainly have a dampening impact on Euro-dollar rates. Furthermore,
the Japanese authorities have recently stepped up their "yen shift"
program aimed at bringing about a further reduction in outstanding
borrowings of Japanese banks from the Euro-dollar market.
During this period of easing Euro-dollar rates, U.S. bank
takings of Euro-dollar funds through foreign branches have increased
by a considerable amount. These borrowings increased by over $850
million in the two weeks ending October 15, more than offsetting the
decline in the last three weeks of September. There has been a moderate
decline in U.S. bank Euro-dollar borrowings since October 15, according
to daily data available through October 20.

U.S. balance of payments. As the fourth quarter begins there
are few signs of any major departures from the course of the balance of
payments accounts described three weeks ago. The liquidity deficit in
the opening weeks of October was very large, but this period is seasonally
very adverse. At the same time there was a sharp rise in borrowings by
banks from their foreign branches, and also some increase in liabilities
to other commercial banks abroad, so that the balance on official settle-
ments has registered a small surplus. This also is probably not indicative
of the outcome for the quarter as a whole.
Early estimates of the September trade results show a somewhat
faster improvement than expected (as noted below) and further gains in
the fourth quarter are likely. Moreover, in view of the very large out-
flow of U.S. direct-investment capital in the first half of the year, and

IV -6
perhaps also in the third quarter, the Office of Foreign Direct Invest-
ments believes there will once again be a steep drop in fourth-quarter
outflows as companies act to stay within their ceilings. Another
favorable factor in the fourth quarter should be the reversal (or at
least the cessation)of capital outflows from the United States for the
purpose of speculation on a DM revaluation or to take advantage of high
Euro-dollar rates. It seems reasonable to expect, therefore, that the
liquidity deficit in the fourth quarter will be much lower than in the
second or third quarters. However, the "special" transactions that also
contributed to the liquidity surplus in the fourth quarter of 1968 will
be missing this year.
Data on third-quarter transactions are still very partial.
The liquidity deficit in September apparently was about $500 million,
resulting in a deficit for the quarter (seasonally adjusted) somewhat
above $2.5 billion. The official settlements deficit for the quarter
is estimated at about $1.3 billion.
Bank lending to foreigners, according to early reports,
resulted in an insignificant outflow in September, as outflows by
banks in New York appear to have been matched by inflows elsewhere.
This would bring the seasonally adjusted inflow for the third quarter
to about $150 million, compared to an outflow of over $500 million in
the second. U.S. net purchases of foreign securities were about $100
million in September -- close to the monthly average for the year --
once again featuring Canadian issues. Foreign investments in U.S.

IV -7
corporate stocks apparently registered a very small net inflow in
September, and amounted to about $50 million for the third quarter
as a whole. Sales of new direct-investment issues in Europe remained
at a relatively low level.
U.S. foreign trade. Although the official trade statistics
for September are not yet available, it is roughly estimated (based
on customs receipts, counts of export documents, etc.) that the export
surplus in that month increased further. Exports in September are
believed to have held at close to the high August level, with an increase
in agricultural shipments offsetting a drop in deliveries of commercial
aircraft. Imports in September may have been down by about 5 per cent
from August. Including these estimates for September, the third quarter
export balance would be about $1-1/4 billion at an annual rate (balance
of payments basis) compared with a small deficit in the first half of
the year, and a surplus of only $1/2 billion at an annual rate in the
second half of 1968.
Still undetermined is whether this recent expansion in the
export surplus represents a basic improvement in our trade position or
was still influenced by secondary effects of the dock strike earlier in
the year. The strike had a greater adverse effect on exports than on
imports, and some foreign users probably drew down inventories of some
commodities sharply when certain types of goods could not be obtained
from the United States in the first quarter. These inventories may
not have been immediately replaced, and some stockbuilding may now be

IV -8
occurring. This situation may exist not only for tobacco and other
agricultural items but also for some crude and semifinished nonagri-
cultural materials.
The export advance in July-August was quite widely distributed
by commodities and areas. The value of shipments of both agricultural
and nonagricultural products was considerably above the strike-depressed
rate in the first half of the year. Compared with the second half of
1968, agricultural exports were about unchanged in July-August,but
nonagricultural shipments were 12 per cent higher.
The increase in nonagricultural exports in July-August was
broadly dispersed, with large gains recorded for machinery, chemicals,
steel and paper products. These advances probably reflect supply
stringencies and peak capacity-utilization manufacturing rates in
Europe. Machinery deliveries were particularly high in August, the
first significant rise since March when most of the struck ports reopened.
Foreign orders for U.S. machinery, which have expanded steadily since
the beginning of 1968, increased very sharply in July-August, promising
further advances in deliveries later this year and in 1970. Shipments
of automotive products to Canada were down from those in the first half
but this may reflect a shift in the seasonal pattern resulting from the
early changeover to the 1970 models. Deliveries of commercial aircraft
in July-August held at the relatively low rate of the first half but
deliveries in September may have been the lowest in more than two years.

IV -9
Exports to all areas except Canada were up sharply in July-
August. The expansion in shipments to Europe and to Latin America was
all in nonagricultural commodities; shipments of agricultural goods to
these countries, which had fallen from the last half of 1968 to the
first half of this year, declined further in July-August. The advance
in exports to Japan and the developing countries of Asia and Africa
included both agricultural and nonagricultural products.
Imports in the third quarter (including a rough estimate for
September) continued to rise faster than GNP. The import/GNP ratio in
the third quarter may be over 3.9 per cent, compared with an average
3.8 per cent in the first half of this year and in calendar 1968.
Continued heavy arrivals of automobiles, other nonfood consumer goods,
and capital equipment in July-August were complemented by increased
imports of foods and industrial materials. The latter two categories
of imports had declined in the first six months of this year from the
values in the last half of 1968. All principal types of industrial
products -- steel and other materials related to durable manufacturing,
textiles, and other nondurable goods -- were all being imported at
appreciably higher rates in July-August than in the first half. The
value of building materials was virtually the only major item among
industrial materials that was lower in July-August than in the first
half, as housing starts fell off and lumber prices eased.

IV -10
Imports of automobiles, other than from Canada, were up
sharply in July-August following a drop in value in the first half
of the year. Sales of foreign cars in the U.S. have been 6 per cent
larger in number in January-September of this year compared with the
same period a year earlier. Sales of Volkswagons are down by more than
10 per cent this year, but this has been more than offset by larger
sales of Toyotas and Datsuns from Japan, Fiats from Italy, and Opels
from Germany. The VW share of foreign car sales in the United States
in January-September of this year was down to about 45 per cent compared
with over 55 per cent a year earlier. Imports of automobiles from
Canada also continued to expand this year although the rate of increase
is more moderate than from 1967 to 1968.
For the first 8 months of 1969 combined, U.S. exports and
imports were about in balance, compared with a surplus of $1/2 billion
(annual rate) in the last half of 1968. The balance with various
regions, however, showed divergent movements. The average monthly
import balances with Canada and Japan were further enlarged this year
as imports advanced more than exports. About one-half of the worsening
in our trade balance with Canada resulted from the continued weakening
in our automotive trade position with that country. Our export balance
with the less-developed countries of Asia and Africa declined as imports
increased. However, there was a sharp swing in the opposite direction
in our trade position with the Latin American countries, from a deficit

IV -11
of 1/2 billion at an annual rate in the second half of 1968 to a surplus
at that rate in the first 8 months of this year. This shift resulted
from a sharp drop in imports, particularly coffee and petroleum.
The export balance with continental Western European countries
was about the same, with both exports and imports larger. Improvement
in the balance with the EEC countries was just about offset by worsening
in the balance with other countries of continental Western Europe. Our
trade position with the United Kingdom -- a small import balance --
showed little change.

IV -12
Economic developments in other industrial countries. Economic
activity in most industrial countries through the third quarter of
this year showed no signs of flagging. However, general expectations
are that restrictive policy measures taken in various countries will
combine to produce some slowdown in growth later this year and early
in 1970. In Canada, industrial production should rebound in the fourth
quarter following the settlement of damaging strikes, but in 1970 it
is expected to level off and might even decline. The German and
Japanese economies are expected to expand at a somewhat reduced rate,
while in France extremely restrictive monetary policy, possibly rein-
forced by further fiscal restraint, may result in a sharply reduced
rate of growth early next year. Only in the United Kingdom is the
rate of expansion expected to quicken next year.

Economic developments through the rest of this year and in
1970 will be influenced by the revaluation of the German mark. Early
in 1970, another influence will also be felt, as economic activity in
the United States declines and our imports level off. By contrast,
the impact of last August's devaluation of the French franc is expected
to be very slight.
The DM revaluation will have some disinflationary effect on
the German economy, but will nevertheless provide a spur to economies
of other countries, especially in Europe. Alternative measures that
might have been used to brake the speed of the German expansion would
not have had this desired effect. The expected U.S. slowdown, on the
other hand, will remove a stimulating influence on the other countries'
activity. The impact of these two factors will be felt with a
considerable and varying lag and the economies of the various countries
will be differently affected by them, depending partly on the relative
importance to them of the German and U.S. markets.

As yet there are no signs that the German boom is moderating.
Real GNP in the first half of 1969 grew at a 6.4 per cent annual rate,
and is expected to grow even slightly faster in the second half of the
year. Third quarter economic indicators so far support these estimates:
in July, new orders for manufactured goods rose by 4 per cent over the
second quarter average, with orders for capital goods rising by 3 per
cent and those for consumer goods rather more, indicating an expected
shift in the demand structure.
The strength of both domestic and foreign demand has forced
the economy to operate very close to capacity, which, however, appears
to have been higher than previously estimated. Unemployment is very
low and unfilled vacancies outnumber the unemployed by 8-1/2 times in
spite of the fact that the number of foreign workers in Germany is now
at an all-time high. Price increases this year through August--since
the introduction in January of border tax adjustments--have been moderate;
wholesale prices from January to August rose by about 2.5 per cent, while
the increase in retail prices during this period just barely exceeded
1 per cent. However, wage negotiations now going on are expected to
result in wage increases higher than in previous years and price rises
may be expected to accelerate before long.
For the next few months, the prospects--on an assumption of
unchanged economic policy--are for continuing expansion. Order backlogs,
particularly in the capital goods industries, are very large and
equivalent to more than 5 months of production--a record level. However,
delivery delays may divert some new demand to outside

IV -15
sources. Also, if the new Brandt government puts through its intention
to remove tax incentives to capital investment, future demand may
moderate to some extent. A moderation of external demand is also expected
after the government establishes a new parity for the DM; a large number
of outstanding foreign orders were clearly of an anticipatory nature, so
that the current growth rate of orders is above the underlying basic rate.
Some of the moderation will be offset by rapid increases in the
demand for consumer goods -- following large increases in disposable
income -- and by rapidly increasing demand for non-residential private
construction. Building permits for business construction increased
9 per cent between March/April and May/June.
In contrast to moderate domestic price increases thus far this
year, export prices of German goods to foreign buyers have risen much
faster. Since the end of 1968, these prices have increased by over
5 per cent, suggesting that most of the 4 per cent reduction of the
border tax rebate on exports has been passed on to foreign buyers.
This sizable increase in German export prices, however, has been only
slightly higher than price increases in other countries. The German trade
surplus for the first 8 months of 1969 stood at $2.3 billion, not signifi-
cantly below the $2.6 billion surplus a year earlier.
The German border tax adjustments are now suspended until
December 1, and it seems unlikely that they will be resurrected -- even
in part -- after the new mark parity is set. Thus, the effect of the
DM revaluation will be reduced by 4 percentage points at least, and
probably by a somewhat larger amount to take account of the fall in the

IV -16
forward exchange rate differential. Nonetheless, even a small revaluation
will have some effect on German exports but the timing and amount of the
impact will depend on the extent to which the revaluation will be
passed on in final prices. Experience with the border tax adjustment of
last year shows that lags can be substantial and that German exporters --
with generally high profit margins -- react very flexibly to market
conditions.
The projected leveling of U.S. imports in the first half of 1970
will also adversely affect German exports. German automobile and steel
exports to the United States -- 4 per cent of all German exports in 1968 --
may prove to be quite sensitive to the level of demand and competition
in the U.S. market.
Two and a half months after the franc devaluation the French
economy still shows signs of severe overheating. Political considerations
have prevented the Government from imposing the much needed strong fiscal
restraint and the authorities are relying heavily on a very restrictive
monetary policy. Short- and medium-term bank credits will be allowed to
expand at a very low rate through mid-1970, reserve requirements for
commercial banks were raised when the Bank of France's discount rate was
set at a record high of 8 per cent earlier this month, and banks are heavily
penalized for exceeding credit expansion limits.
In France all sectors, except the construction industry,
contributed to the high level of activity in 1969 and capacity limits,
in part caused by a shortage of skilled labor, were reached in most
industries at varying times, resulting in an erratic behavior of the

IV -17
industrial production index. Although French exports have been
increasing rapidly, the inability of the domestic economy to satisfy
internal demand, coupled with anticipatory buying that preceded the
franc devaluation, caused imports to soar, and the current account
deficit this year is expected to exceed $1.2 billion. The trade
deficit in September, the first full month after devaluation, has
been a record high for France according to preliminary figures
published last week.
The government's policy stance is now strongly restrictive,
with fiscal policy being moderately so and monetary policy extremely
tight. However, the full effect of these policies and the devaluation
will not be felt until next year. The revaluation of the DM should
benefit the French trade balance, but structural rigidities within
the economy will hamper the needed shift of resources to production
for export. Wage negotiations, about to be concluded, will probably
result in higher wage increases than the authorities deem desirable.
Most French exporters, anticipating higher wage costs, did not reduce
their foreign currency prices following the devaluation. French-U.S.
trade is not very large and most French exports to the United States
are not very sensitive to small downward changes in the level of U.S.
demand.

IV -16
Following a decline in the first quarter of 1969, the
United Kingdom's GDP staged a moderate recovery in the second quarter.
The recovery was led by exports and slightly increased consumer spend-
ing, with aggregate investment outlays remaining unchanged. In the
third quarter scattered data suggest that another moderate quarter-
to-quarter rise in GDP will be registered. Growth is expected to
continue in 1970, probably at a somewhat faster pace, especially if
some restraint is removed early next spring.
Price increasesthis year have been moderate. The retail
price index rose by 1.7 per cent from January/March to July/August.
Wages during this period grew by 2.7 per cent. Unemployment reportedly
increased from about 2.2 per cent in the first quarter to 2.5 per cent
in the third quarter. However, the actual rise may have been less,
as doubts exist about the accuracy of the seasonal adjustment.
Unemployment in excess of 2 per cent is high by British standards,
but current unemployment rates may not be strictly comparable with
the rates of the past, because of more generous unemployment benefits
and a rise in structural unemployment.
During the second quarter of 1969 the United Kingdom had a
substantial surplus on the basic balance of payments, which had been
in deficit in the first quarter. Moreover, in two successive months--
August and September--a large surplus on the merchandise trade account
was recorded. The authorities have not eased the restraints imposed
on the economy since the 1967 devaluation of the pound and earlier this
week announced that the import deposit scheme, due to expire on December
5, will be extended in a slightly milder form for another 12 months.

IV -19
Although British-German direct trade is not very significant,
the DM revaluation should work out to Britain's advantage in many
third markets where the goods of the two countries compete. However,
the beneficial effects of the mark parity change on trade will be felt
with some lag. The rise in the floating DM exchange rate has already
helped to reverse speculative capital flows that in the past caused
reserve losses for the United Kingdom.
By contrast, a leveling off or a drop in U.S. imports will
rapidly prove harmful to the United Kingdom. The United States is
Britain's largest customer and accounted for 14 per cent of that
country's exports in 1968.
In Italy the expansion of activity has remained strong during
this year, with stronger than expected domestic demand leading the
expansion. This has resulted in an acceleration of the rate of import
growth and some shrinkage of the Italian trade surplus. Wages have
been increasing faster than in recent years and price increases have
been more marked after a prolonged period of exceptional stability.
Expansion is expected to affect Italian imports only very slightly,but
Italian exports should benefit fairly strongly. About one-tenth of
all German imports originate in Italy and, in addition, Italian
manufacturers compete with German exporters in many third markets.
In the Netherlands economic expansion continued through
July at a very rapid pace, led by an exceptionally good performance
of the export sector. In August, unfilled job vacancies exceeded the

IV -20
number of unemployed by nearly 1-1/2 to 1. It appears that the economy
is operating nearly at capacity with a shortage of skilled labor being
a major restraint on further rapid expansion of production. Dutch price
developments this year were very unsatisfactory--with consumer prices
rising 6 per cent from mid-December to mid-April--and the authorities
were forced to impose a price freeze in April. The freeze was lifted
in September after the consumer price index showed a small decline from
the April level.
The DM revaluation should benefit Dutch exports, more than
a fourth of which go to Germany. Thus the economic expansion may be
expected to continue, perhaps at a slightly slower rate, through the
spring of 1970. At the same time, it is not expected that Dutch im-
ports from Germany will decline to any great extent and their higher
prices could intensify inflationary pressure. If the DM revaluation
is sizable, the Dutch authorities may decide to revalue the guilder,
but by a smaller percentage then the change in the parity of the mark.
The Belgian economy continued to expand strongly through the
year and it is expected that the expansion will continue, although
somewhat more slowly, through the first half of 1970 in spite of the
very sharp increases in interest rates this year. The revaluation of
the DM will clearly benefit Belgian exports, but the increased cost of
imports from Germany will intensify the pressure on Belgian prices,
which at the retail level have recently been rising at about a 4 per
cent annual rate.

IV -21
The inflationary pressures in Japan, led by sustained consumer
spending and private equipment outlays,may cause some deceleration
in the rate of industrial production expansion as policies become
more restrictive. Increasing imports caused a swing in the trade
account from a surplus of $178 million in March to a deficit of $7
million in August. Pressure on prices has been acute, and consumer
prices in August were 8 per cent higher than a year earlier--a much
higher rate of increase than in recent years.
Wage increases have also been exceptionally high, with
nominal wages in July 21 per cent higher than a year earlier. The
signs of overheating in the economy caused the authorities to
tighten monetary policy significantly early in September. Further
restrictive measures may be expected should the economy not show
signs of cooling off.
While direct German-Japanese trade is quite small, the
Japanese trade balance should nevertheless benefit from the DM
revaluation through shifts in third markets. On the other hand, the
U.S. market is of crucial importance to Japan--nearly a third of
Japanese exports come here--and the expected leveling of U.S.
imports will significantly affect the Japanese economy.
In Canada, industrial production, handicapped by a record
number of man-hours lost through strikes, has shown little change
since early 1969 and, after some improvement in the last quarter of
this year, is expected to level off again during the first half of
1970. In the second quarter of 1969 GNP fell by about 0.2 per cent.

IV -22
To some extent, demand has moderated as a result of deliberately
tight monetary and fiscal policies, which appear to be resulting in
a desired slowing of price advances. The earlier rise in Canada
prices may have affected the competitiveness of Canadian exports, which
have lately showed a decrease in their rate of growth. However,
other factors have probably been more important--world wheat glut,
iron ore, steel and nickel strikes. Should labor unrest end in the
near future--the only major strike still in progress is in the nickel
industry--the industrial production index in the fourth quarter may
show a sharp increase from the depressed level in the third quarter.
Unless there is some easing of the now very tight monetary policy,
the Canadian economy may experience a mild recession in the first
half of 1970. The projected slowdown of the U.S. economy will
contribute to this outcome, since two-thirds of Canadian exports go
to the United States.

APPENDIX A: RECENT BORROWING OPERATIONS OF FHLB AND FNMA.*
The Federal Home Loan Banks and Federal National Mortgage
Association recently have sharply increased their borrowings in the
securities markets to provide funds to the housing industry. During
the second and third quarters of this year, these Agencies borrowed
a total of $4.2 billion of new money as compared with $2.2 billion of
new cash raised during the same period of 1966.

This note first examines briefly the relation of liquid
asset positions of the Home Loan Banks and FNMA to their market
borrowing schedules. Second, given the need for market borrowing,
it looks at pricing of new issues in the context of an already
heavy capital markets calendar, with some reference to dealer
positions in Agencies during these months.

Division of Reseatch and Statistics; with the assistance of Ann
Lacy Shockley.

Timing of Market Borrowing. In the first six months of 1969,
the Home Loan Banks were able to hold down their market borrowing
by drawing down their liquidity. As shown in table 2, Home Loan Bank
liquid assets (cash plus investments) declined from $2.5 billion to
under $1.6 billion between December 1968 and July 1969. The latter
amount appears close to what the Banks regard as a minimum liquidity
cushion, considering that their net payments to savings and loan
associations during a single month have amounted to as much as nearly
$1 billion. In 1966, for example, the low point in their liquid
asset position was $1.3 billion.
As would be expected, the sharpest drops in their liquid asset
holdings often occurred in the months which included savings and loan
quarterly reinvestment periods. For instance, in July of this year,
the decline in these assets was over a half billion dollars, thereby
financing a large portion of the nearly $1 billion in net advances.
Similarly, in other months, by using their liquid assets as a cushion,
the Home Loan Banks have been able to schedule their borrowing in a
much smoother pattern than their need for funds to finance advances
to savings and loan associations.
If advances to members continue large in the months ahead--
as seems likely given prevailing interest rate relationships--the Home
Loan Banks will have to undertake further very large borrowings in the
securities markets. Moreover, from here on out their advances to
savings and loan associations will have to depend more on borrowed funds
in view of their reduced liquidity reserves. Also, if market rates
should decline appreciably, the Home Loan Banks, like many other borrowers,
can be expected to tap the market to rebuild their liquidity position.
Table 2 reveals a number of interesting differences in the
management of the liquidity position of FNMA in contrast to that of
the Home Loan Banks. FNMA apparently has only a small demand for
liquid assets and is willing to utilize them fully when it does have
them. At the latest reading--in August--the Association had a working
balance of only $7 million, a very sharp drop from June and July.
An important distinction in the financial management of
FNMA versus that of the FHLB's is that the former decides in advance
the total amount of mortgage holdings it will take. In contrast,
the Home Loan Banks do not know ahead of time the size of net
advance to S and L's. FNMA also raises some of its money on quick
notice through the sale of discount notes, thus supplementing the
sale of coupon-bearing obligations, which follows a more regular
pattern.

Marketing of New Issues. The yields on new FHLB and FNMA
offerings rose steadily over the first 9-months of 1969, reaching
a record 8.75 per cent on October 2 on a 16-month FNMA issue, more
than 2 percentage points above the yield set on a 1-year FNMA
offering in January. To a large extent, these increases reflect
the general rise in interest rates that has taken place in 1969.
Importantly, however, the spreads on these new issues from outstanding
direct Government securities of comparable maturities also widened
considerably on average in the second and third quarters of 1969
(See Table 4). There has also been a concentration of the major
share of recent FHLB and FNMA financings in the shorter-term area.
In the first three quarters of this year, 20 of the 23 offerings of
these Agencies have had final maturities of 3 years

of easier credit conditions--the mortgage-related Agencies sold

Most of the FHLB and FNMA financings in the last few months
met good initial market receptions, partly because their yields were
high enough to attract an increasing number of investors, and most of
the issues were quoted at premiums just after coming to market; as

One issue which failed to sell well, however, was the 5-year
FNMA option marketed at the end of August, when rates generally were
dimbing to new peaks. The 7.85 per cent yield was priced too close to
the yields on outstanding Agencies in the 5-year area, and the issue was
bid nearly a point below par after three days on the market. In an
effort to lighten their inventories of this issue, dealers experienced
an underwriting loss, since any trading below about 99-25/32 would wipe
out the dealers' reoffering spread.
The improvement that has characterized the Government and
other securities markets since the beginning of October also has
affected the Agency market. In consequence, the 8.25 and 8.20 per cent

-7 -
yields set on the 1-year and 25-month FHLB offerings on October 15
were well below the 8.75 and 8.70 per cent rates FNNA had to pay
on roughly comparable maturities just two weeks earlier. A
special factor helping the Agency market is the growing awareness
of the attractive interest return. A large motor company, for
instance, recently made substantial purchases of short-term Agency
issues.
Dealer Positions. Dealers' total positions in all Agency
issues fluctuated widely, as the accompanying chart shows, in response
to the size, timing and attractiveness of new issues. 1/ The
generally advanced levels of dealer positions in Agency securities
between April and July reflected congestion in the Agency market
during that period. In view of the even larger amount of Agency
borrowing in the third quarter, it is surprising that dealer positions
have remained relatively low since August. Apparently Agency offerings
were priced sufficiently attractively to enable a quick distribution
by the underwriters. Thus the Agency market now is in a good technical
position and there is no immediate difficulty in sight for the
marketing of the forthcoming Agency borrowing.
1/ The chart takes special note of FHLB and FNMA financing operations,
but dealer inventories are also influenced by offerings by Federal
Land Banks, Federal Intermediate Credit Banks and Banks for
Cooperatives, as well as acquisitions in the secondary market.
