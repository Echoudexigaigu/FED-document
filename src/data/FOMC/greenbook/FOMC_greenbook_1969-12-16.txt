SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK
Outlook for economic activity
Growth in current dollar GNP appears to be slowing substan-
tially in the fourth quarter. The smaller rise in prospect reflects a
continued weakening in final demands; additions to inventory may be as
large or larger than in the third quarter. Price increases have con-
tinued rapid, and the moderation in process is being reflected in a
reduced rate of real growth.
Recent reports on business plans for capital spending have
been relatively strong, but most other indicators of economic activiry
continued to moderate in November--with the notable exception of the
unemployment rate--generally appearing to confirm our estimate of
appreciable easing in overall economic growth. Industrial production
may have declined more in November than in any of the three previous
months, even after adjustment for effects of strikes. Cuts in auto
output have been sizable and the lower rate of assemblies is now
scheduled to continue into early next year. With industrial output
down, manufacturing employment also fell in November, as did overtime
hours, and unemployment claims rose further.
Personal income apparently rose only moderately in November,
the third successive month of substantially slower growth. With prices
continuing to rise rapidly, consumers have remained cautious. Judging
from the weekly data, retail sales declined in November, and have
remained virtually unchanged since early last spring. Trade reports
indicate that Christmas shopping has been rather lackluster so far.

I -2
The projected rise in business capital spending in the first
half of 1970 has been revised upward, in line with the recent Commerce-
SEC survey, but final demands in most other sectors are still expected
to remain relatively weak. Residential construction activity is
especially vulnerable to growing tightness in the mortgage market and
extremely high interest rates, and it seems increasingly likely that
housing starts will fall off sharply further in the months ahead.
Current and prospective difficulties in raising funds can also be
expected to limit State and local government capital expenditures
through much of next year. It also still appears likely that Federal
purchases of goods and services will decline through the first half of
next year.
Recent Congressional actions on taxes and social security
benefits have been in the direction of stimulating disposable income
more than allowed for in our projections. Such actions, however, are
subject to changes in conference committee, and to Presidential veto.
Assessment of the extent to which these actions might provide additional
stimulus to consumer expenditures will have to await more definitive
developments. It should be noted now, however, that enactment of a
15 per cent increase in social security benefits payable in the second
quarter and retroactive to the beginning of the year would raise dis-
posable incomes and consumer outlays at that time substantially more
than we have assumed in our projection.

I -3
Outlook for resource use and prices
The manufacturing capacity utilization rate declined sharply
further in November to below 82 per cent; much of this decline was a
result of the General Electric strike, but with industrial production
down this quarter and expected to come down further in the first half
of next year--while capacity continues to grow--the utilization rate is
expected to decline to 80 per cent or lower by mid-1970.
The sharp November decline in the unemployment rate to 3.4 per
cent does not appear representative of the underlying situation in the
labor market. The drop occurred mainly among secondary workers--younger
persons and women--many of whom left the labor force, at least tempor-
arily. Manufacturing employment declined appreciably even after
adjustment for strikes and the average workweek in manufacturing remained
at the reduced October level. The insured unemployment rate moved up
significantly further in November and was running well above year-earlier
levels.
Nonfarm employment is still projected to change little in the
first half of next year with manufacturing employment likely to edge
down further. Under those circumstances, the unemployment rate would
be likely to rise irregularly to about the 4.5 per cent level by mid-1970.
Wage and benefit settlements next year are expected to be
large despite prospective easing of conditions in the labor market and
minimal growth of employment. Key negotiations are particularly import-
ant in the first quarter of 1970, as contracts expire covering a total
of 1.5 million workers in the railroad, trucking, and apparel industries.

I-4
However, a reduced workweek, less overtime pay, easier labor market
conditions and stiffer resistance by management should help to moderate
the overall increase in average hourly earnings.
Unit labor costs are likely to rise substantially further
next year, and pressures to raise or maintain prices will be strong in
an environment of declining profits. Recent price developments have not
been encouraging and we have raised somewhat our estimate of the amount
of price increase next year. One unfavorable feature of the recent
situation has been that the boom in Western Europe and Japan has added
to upward price pressures on internationally traded materials. Never-
theless, we still look for a slowing of the domestic price rise,
primarily because of our expectation of slack demand relative to grow-
ing resource capabilities.
Prospective financial developments
Assuming that current money market conditions and interest
rate ceilings are held unchanged into early 1970, supplies of funds
will remain severely constricted. In fact, some analysts fear that a
combination of low liquidity and heavy net savings attrition will create
severe problems for some depositary-type institutions during the post-
interest crediting period just ahead.
Pressure of demands on the limited credit supplies will tend
to maintain upward pressures on market yields, although interest rates
will also be highly sensitive to news reports regarding the economy,
fiscal and monetary policies, and any indications of a change in the

I-5
strength of credit demands. Week to week developments could thus lead
to sizable interest rate fluctuations over the next month or so. It
seems unlikely, however, that recent rate peaks will be significantly
exceeded, And there could be some rate declines as the first quarter
progresses.
Outlook for commercial banks. Pressures on the commercial banking
system in December appear to be coming chiefly from current and pros-
pective year-end credit demands. Non-financial corporations--with their
liquidity depleted and quarterly income tax payments expected to reach
record proportions for the month--are likely to step up demands on bank
credit lines at mid-December. Dealer borrowing also remains large, and
finance company borrowing is likely to run high to cover seasonal
redemptions of the large volume of maturing paper. Some seasonal
drop-off in dealer and business loan demands can, of course, be
expected after the turn of the year. And over the full first quarter,
some weakening in business loans would be consistent with the projected
slowing in GNP growth, including inventory investment.
While total deposits at banks are projected to show a small
increase in December, net deposit attrition is likely to resume again
in size during January as funds are transferred from consumer-type
accounts to market securities. CD attrition at major city banks may
continue to be cushioned to some extent by inflows of funds from
foreign official sources. But a large seasonally adjusted decline is
likely in January, since this is a month that normally shows sizable
unadjusted growth.

I- 6
To replenish their loan funds in the period ahead, banks can
thus be expected to bid actively for Federal funds and Euro-dollars.
Some banks will probably add further to outstanding commercial paper
of their affiliates--although the over-all growth in such outstandings
has thus far remained below the accelerated October pace reached just
prior to publication of the Board's proposed regulation.
Mortgage markets. At nonbank thrift institutions net savings
losses to securities markets are also expected to be unusually large
during the December-January reinvestment period. Given the unprecedently
high spreads now prevailing between savings rates and market yields, and
the more than $18 billion of certificate-type accounts that mature at
savings and loan associations during December and January, some of the
more pessimistic forecasters fear this attrition may run to as much
as $2.5 billion--although such estimates are highly uncertain.-
If savings losses at thrift institutions should approach
these proportions, resulting drains on the liquid assets of the Federal
Home Loan Bank System would very likely force it to borrow directly from
the U.S. Treasury. Moreover, as the intensity of the further squeeze
on mortgage lenders became evident, more severe reductions in new mort-
gage loan commitments at thrift institutions could be expected, and
pressures on FNMA to expand public supplements to mortgage flows would
be increased.
1/ The $18 billion plus figure on maturing certificates was obtained
from a special United States Savings and Loan League Survey and should
be kept confidential.

I- 7
After January, the thrift institutions may experience some
modest resumption of net growth in their savings flows. Even if
market rates receded substantially from their recent highs, however,
spreads against prevailing savings rates would still be so large that
thrift institution performance would probably remain relatively poor.
Thus, the outlook is for heavy continuing demands on securities markets
by the FHLBB and the FNMA, along with further overall deterioration in
fund flows to mortgage markets and a further rise in mortgage rates.
Bond markets. New bond offerings in both the corporate and
municipal markets will be seasonally light from mid-December to early
January. This respite from the pressure of new issues should afford
dealers an opportunity to reduce the uncomfortably large inventory
positions built up during the heavy recent volume of underwritings.
Since the year-end is typically associated with increased fund flows
from pension funds, trust accounts, and the like, and since such
flows will be bolstered substantially this year by transfers of funds
out of depositary institutions, the recent tendency for bond yields
to drift lower may persist at least temporarily.
As the first quarter progresses, however, the prospective
volume of new security offerings may exert renewed upward pressures
on yields. Corporate public bond offerings are expected to rise from
their recent volume--a level of offerings that has itself posed
marketing difficulties. Public utility financing needs remain pressing,

I- 8
and underwriters report that the financial positions of an increasing
number of industrial firms are about at the point where near-term capital
market financing seems desirable--even at high rates.
While capital market financing by State and local governments
continues to be constrained by the very high level of prevailing
yields, the importance of this constraint appears to have weakened, so
that volume is unlikely to be cut back again to the sharply reduced levels
of last summer. Governmental units with the ability to finance appear
determined to do so; some States have obtained higher interest rate
ceilings; and an increasing number of units without ceilings are
coming to market. Furthermore, bond volume could be sustained by the
need to refinance short-term borrowings.
Balance of payments outlook
Currently available data provide no basis for revising
earlier estimates of the U.S. balance of payments in the period ahead,
but the indications are at best only moderately encouraging. The
October trade figures (published two weeks ago) support the projection
of a continuing rise in U.S. exports, as do the mounting evidences from
Europe of strong demand and cost-push pressures there. On the other
hand, U.S. imports in October were up enough from September to leave
it doubtful whether the projected sharp slowing in U.S. import growth
was under way yet.

I -9
Similarly, in the long-term capital account there was a
rising inflow of foreign net purchases of U.S. corporate stocks in
late summer and early autumn, but November's reversal of price move-
ments in the stock market makes it doubtful that such a trend has
continued.
With regard to the official settlements balance, the prospects
of an early worsening through large repayments of Euro-dollar borrowings
by U.S. banks, which momentarily came into the limelight in October,
have evaporated in recent weeks along with market hopes of an early
easing of U.S. monetary conditions. A net inflow of over $1 billion
between October 29 and mid-November brought the overhang of U.S. banks'
outstanding liabilities to branches to a level about as high as in
mid-October. Since December 4, the action taken by the Bundesbank to
encourage repatriations by German banks has added to tensions in the
Euro-dollar market, as indicated by the fact that the 3-month deposit
rate in London is again around 11 per cent.
A part of the large outflow of funds from the German mark
during October and November evidently came directly to the United States,
lowering our liquidity deficit in those months and helping to generate
an official settlements surplus in November. The recent favorable
flows from the mark and from the Euro-dollar market may be supplemented
before the year is over by a slackening (or temporary reversal) of
direct investment outflows, aimed to meet program targets. Moreover,

I -10
seasonal factors in some other elements of the balance of payments
are favorable in December. It may be recalled that the balance of
payments showed a strong surplus in late December a year ago. Looking
into the new year, however, the chances of continuation of an official
settlements surplus are slight, to say the least.

THE ECONOMIC PICTURE IN DETAIL
Domestic Nonfinancial Scene
Gross national product. The dichotomy between the continuing
strength of longer term business expectations, as reflected in planned
new investment, and weakening of current demand has apparently widened.
The latest (November) Commerce-SEC survey of anticipated business
spending shows a further rise in capital expenditures for the fourth
quarter of this year and a significant upward adjustment in anticipated
spending in the first half of 1970. And yet, aside from a drop in the
total unemployment rate in November--the significance of which is
questionable--major economic indicators reflect no new sources of a
pickup in current demand. Recent weakness already has been reflected
in reduced industrial output, declines in manufacturing employment and
the workweek,and considerably slower growth in personal income. At the
same time, there has been no indication as yet of any easing of cost
and price pressures which apparently remain a major stimulus to increased
investment spending.
The added strength now anticipated in business spending does
not appear to provide sufficient impetus to change materially the over-
all outlook for economic activity. There is continued weakness in most
other sectors, and it still appears likely to us that the next few
quarters will see a distinctly slower growth of GNP. We are now pro-
jecting an increase in GNP of $12 billion this quarter--a slightly

II -2
smaller rise than was carried in the last Greenbook. In real terms, we
expect GNP growth to drop to about 1 per cent.
Consumer demand for goods has remained quite sluggish. Unit
sales of autos were down by 7 per cent in October and edged off further
in November. Retail sales as a whole declined last month, remaining
below year-earlier levels in real terms for the sixth month in a row.
With curtailed growth in employment and a shortened workweek,gains in
income have been reduced in the past few months, weakening the support
for growth in consumption. (Personal income gains in November were
reduced--probably by $1 billion or more, annual rate--by the G. E.
strike. It now seems unlikely that the strike will be settled before
year-end and the level of wages and salaries is likely to be affected
in December as well.) Moreover, recent consumer buying intentions
surveys show a further weakening of spending propensities.
Housing starts dropped again in October, and residential
construction activity shows every indication of a further decline as a
result of the greatly reduced availability and high cost of mortgage
funds. State and local government spending has also been hard hit by
high interest rates, and outlays by this sector should continue to be
limited, and to increase at a substantially slower rate than during the
first half of this year. Finally, with the Administration remaining
firm in its determination to restrain growth of expenditures, purchases
by the Federal government are projected to be reduced further in this
quarter and through the first half of next year.

II -3
The only major source of expansive strength continues to be
in plantand equipment spending. Businessmen currently anticipate
increasing their expenditures for new plant and equipment at about a
10 per cent annual rate between the third quarter of 1969 and the
second quarter of 1970, a substantially larger increase than we had
been assuming. The upward revision in plans primarily affects spending
in the early part of next year. We have revised our projections for
1970 accordingly, although we have smoothed out slightly the very large
bulge expected in the first quarter, and are projecting a $3 billion
increase, with progressively smaller increases for the next two quarters.
Much of the boost expected in the first half of 1970 is in communications
and public utilities. It still seems probable that investment plans will
be dampened by disappointing levels of sales, reduced profits and the
elimination of the investment tax credit which appears likely by the end
of this year, But, in line with recent surveys, we are now projecting
an increase in business fixed investment for 1970 as a whole of about
8-1/2 per cent, as compared with the rise of 6 per cent formerly pro-
jected.
As far as the current quarter is concerned, the new survey
figures have little effect on our projections. We had earlier estimated
a fairly large increase in plant and equipment spending, but available
figures on nonresidential construction and shipments of machinery--as
well as the survey itself--now appear to suggest a somewhat slower growth.
Although our overall GNP projections have been raised some-
what as a result of the larger rise now expected in business spending,

II -4
it still appears likely that real GNP growth will show little or no
gain in the first half of the next year. With money markets continuing
under restraint, construction activity is almost certain to decline
further and State and local spending to continue growing more slowly.
Curtailed growth in employment and reduced workweeks are likely to con-
tinue to dampen growth of personal income and to hold increases in
consumption in check, even assuming a reduction of the surtax on
January 1 and increased Social Security benefits in April. As a
result, only moderate increases in final sales are expected, and a
distinct slowing of inventory growth is projected to get underway in
the first quarter, and with it a substantially slower growth of GNP.
The October inventory investment was quite large, in part because of
an accumulation of auto stocks, and accumulation for this quarter is
likely to be as large or larger than in the third quarter.
With demand pressures easing, some moderation of price
increases also seems likely, although recent large advances at both
wholesale and retail and continued large wage adjustments suggest that
moderation of inflationary pressures may proceed more slowly than we
had been anticipating; we are now projecting the GNP deflator to dip to
about a 3-1/2 per cent annual rate by the second quarter of 1970, down
from a 5 per cent rate of increase in the second quarter of this year.
These projections assume a reduction of the surcharge to
5 per cent for the first half of 1970, which adds about $4-1/4 billion
(annual rate) to disposable income in the first quarter, and a 10 per
cent increase in Social Security benefits effective April 1, worth an

II -5
additional $3 billion in disposable income in the second quarter.
Senate action on the tax bill in the past few days raises the possi-
bility of larger Social Security expenditures and lower tax revenue
next year than we had been assuming, which would tend to add strength
to the outlook for growth of disposable income and consumption,
especially in the first half. However, such actions are still subject
to conference committee changes, and to Presidential veto.
We still assume, as we did in the October Chart Show, that
some easing of monetary restraint early in the year would allow a turn-
around in construction activity in the latter half of 1970. With
adjustments of production to demand likely to be more or less completed
by then, moreover, inventory investment should stabilize. Consumer
demand will receive further support from elimination of the surcharge
on July 1 and from an expected Federal pay raise. Under these condi-
tions, a resumption of moderate growth of real GNP would be likely in
the second half, but at a rate somewhat less than the expected growth
of resources. This would permit some easing of cost pressures, and
some further progress toward moderating inflationary pressures.

Industrial production. Industrial production in November is
tentatively estimated to have declined about 1 per cent or more, around
2 points, from the preliminary October level of 173.3. The General
Electric strike, affecting output of consumer durable goods, business
equipment, and industrial materials and parts for further processing,
accounted for more than half of the November drop. Further cutbacks in
production in the automotive industry accounted for about .4 of a point
decline in the total index.
Output of final products was curtailed sharply in November.
Auto assemblies were at an annual rate of 7.9 million units, down from
8.4 in October and 9.1 in July and August. While production of house-
hold appliances and television sets was sharply curtailed by the G. E.
strike, other manufacturers of these goods also have announced cuts in
output, as inventories remain high relative to sluggish retail sales.
Production of furniture declined further. Output of business equipment
also dropped because of the G. E. strike; those equipment industries
which have not been affected by the strike have generally maintained
production at record levels.
With respect to materials, preliminary data indicate that
output of raw steel, paper, and some chemicals changed little in
November. The sharp cutback in auto production since midyear is now
being reflected in production declines in supplying industries--
automotive steel, metal stampings, rubber products, etc.
The pattern of change in industrial production in November,
after allowance for the widespread effects of the G. E. strike, was

II -9
much the same as in the previous four months. Downward adjustments in
output of many consumer durable goods, apparel, and defense equipment;
a leveling off in production of some materials and declines in others
used by manufacturers of consumer durable goods and in private resi-
dential construction; and a continuing high level in production of
business equipment. Again, abstracting from the effects of the G. E.
strike and its eventual settlement, the outlook for December and early
1970 appears to be for further weakness unless there is a marked pickup
in consumer demand.
Retail sales. Retail sales in October were revised upward
0.8 per cent as the more complete sample became available, to a level
1.2 per cent above September. Nevertheless, sales were still only
about one-half per cent above April, the previous peak. The advance
report for November, however, indicates a decline in sales of about
1 per cent from October with sales of nondurable goods about unchanged.
The two months together average about the same as in the second quarter.
In real terms, November was the sixth consecutive month in which sales
were below year-earlier levels.
Sales of department stores have continued stronger throughout
the year relative to last year than total retail trade. After reaching
a peak in April, department store sales tended to flatten out. Even
after gains in October and November, volume last month was still
slightly below the April level, but 5 per cent above a year earlier.

last 10 days of November were at the lowest level of the month, after
allowance for intra-month seasonal variation.
Dealer stocks of new domestic autos on November 30, at 1.5
million units, remained near the record end of October level and were
3 per cent above a year earlier. The seasonally adjusted stock-sales
ratio was at 61 days' supply.
Consumer credit. Consumer instalment credit outstanding
increased at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $8 billion in October
with more than one-half of the increase occurring in automobile credit.
The over-all October expansion was lightly less than in September but
exceeded the $7.7 billion annual rate of increase of the third quarter.
The $4.1 billion rise in auto credit during October was the
largest monthly gain so far this year. Credit extensions for auto purchases
rose to a new peak, while repayments eased slightly for the second month
in a row.
In contrast to auto credit, the increase in outstandings for
other consumer goods was the smallest in nearly 2-1/2 years, and the net
decrease in repair and modernization credit was the largest in many
years. Personal loans continued to expand at about the same rate as in
the first three quarters of 1969.

Michigan Survey Research Center consumer survey. The index
of consumer sentiment registered a sharp drop for the third successive
quarter, declining to a level very close to the post-war low for this
index which occurred during the 1957-58 recession. Much of the deter-
ioration in sentiment reflects a substantial increase in the number of
respondents who expect business conditions to be worse in the next
12 months. The Survey Research Center attributes this pessimism to
belief that the Administration will force a slowdown in the economy;
there was a sharp increase in the percentage of families expected an
increase in unemployment in the next year.

Pessimistic responses to other questions that are not
included in the index for sentiment, as well as the decline in the index,
led the Center to suggest that there will be a decline in consumer
expenditures for durable goods. Buying intentions for cars were down
for the first time during 1969 on a year-over-year comparison, and there
was a substantial fall in the number of families who thought it was a
good time to buy cars, large household goods, or houses. This poor
evaluation of buying conditions appears inconsistent with some improvement

II -13
in consumers' evaluation of the outlook for prices and the level of
interest rates. The Center suggests that consumers now have more faith
that the Administration will be able to slow inflation. The greater
optimism about the price outlook is possibly the explanation for the lack
of change reported in consumers' evaluation of their expected personal
financial situation for the next year which appears at some odds with
their pessimistic view of business conditions.

Cyclical indicators. In October, the Census composite
leading indicator adjusted for trend declined nearly one per cent.
Series declining included the manufacturing workweek, initial claims
for unemployment insurance (inverted), industrial materials prices,
housing permits, durable goods new orders, and plant and quipment
contracts and orders. Series rising included the common stock price
index and the ratio of price to unit labor cost. For November, the
preliminary industrial materials price index and the 500 common stock
price index were above the October average levels, although stock prices.
declined during the month and were down further early in December. The
manufacturing workweek was unchanged in November, and unemployment claims
were down again (on an inverted basis).

The coincident composite for October rose back to its August

The recent performance of the leading and coincident indi-
cators can best be characterized as hesitation at a high level. Earlier
in the year, through April, both composites were increasing strongly.

Inventories. Book value of business inventories rose at a
$17 billion annual rate in October. Accumulation was greater than the
average of the third quarter, increasing mainly in durable goods manu-
facturing and trade. The increase at durable goods retailers was largely
associated with October's rise in unit auto stocks. This rate of
accumulation is not likely to continue, since unit stocks changed little
in November and auto output is scheduled to be cut further in December.
In addition, recent price movements suggest that the inventory valuation
adjustment may be somewhat higher in the fourth quarter than in the
third. Together, these facts suggest that the fourth quarter GNP inven-
tory figure may not necessarily exceed the third.

Most of the October increase in manufacturers' inventories
was in durable goods stocks at equipment manufacturing industries--
especially nonelectrical machinery--and the durable goods increase was
was equally divided between finished and in-process inventories.

Manufacturers now anticipate that they will increase inven-
tories at a $8.8 billion rate in the fourth quarter as a whole--slightly
below the October rate, in the case of both durable and nondurable
goods. They are projecting the first quarter increase at an annual rate
of $6 billion--$4 billion in durables and $2 billion in nondurables.
Durable goods manufacturers anticipate a slight decline in sales in the
current quarter and an increase of less than 1 per cent in the first
quarter, while nondurable goods manufacturers expect no change in sales
this quarter and a slight increase next quarter, so that inventory-sales
ratios are expected to rise appreciably, particularly for durables manu-
facturers in the current quarter.

The over-all inventory-sales ratio was unchanged in October,

Orders and shipments. Manufacturers' new orders declined
slightly in October after the sharp increase the previous month, but
remained above the third-quarter average. Equipment orders dropped
back from the unexpectedly high September level; this decline was almost
offset, however, by a rise in defense orders from their reduced September
level. The durable goods backlog was about unchanged and shipments rose
slightly, resulting in a small further decline in the durable goods
ratio of backlogs to shipments.

Construction and real estate, Seasonally adjusted outlays
for new construction put in place, which were revised downward for
October,l changed little in November at an annual rate of $91.8 billion.
This was just below the peak in September. While the year-to-year
increase amounted to 5 per cent, all of it reflected higher costs as
measured by the Census Bureau.
Private residential outlays, the level of which was revised
upward by 6 per cent-/ for most months this year owing to a sharply
higher benchmark adjustment for additions and alterations, apparently
dipped slightly from October to November. Even so, the over-all rate
of residential outlays was 6 per cent below the peak reached last
April. Moreover, with downward pressures from financial markets on
new housing starts persisting, some acceleration in the downtrend in
expenditures for new dwelling units and in total residential outlays
is indicated for the period ahead.
Expenditures for private nonresidential construction in
November apparently held at the October rate after a relatively sharp
drop from their high in September. Among the major component groups,
1/ This reflected substantial though largely offsetting revisions in
the level of two component groups for most recent months this year as
well as for October. In the case of residential additions and alter-
ations, a series with a considerable data lag, the Census revision for
recent months was upward by nearly $2 billion. For State and local
construction, it was downward by about $2.5 billion.

Public construction outlays moved higher in November, but--
based on recent revisions--State and local outlays are now reported to
have remained well below the peak established in February and, in
fact, to have continued below a year earlier for the fifth consecutive
month. This pattern contrasts sharply with the steady uptrend reported
earlier and is in line with the results of the Board's survey of State
and local government borrowing realizations for the third quarter of
this year, as summarized in the supplement to the previous Greenbook.
With mortgage markets continuing to tighten and available
stocks of homes for sale becoming increasingly limited, transactions

II -20
levels. In October, unit sales of such homes were running about 7
per cent below a year earlier, according to the National Association of
Real Estate Boards. Prices of such homes actually sold meanwhile were
holding nearly a tenth higher than the year before.
Plant and equipment spending plans. Recent surveys indicate
that business spending for new plant and equipment is currently running
higher than anticipated earlier and will continue to rise through the
first half of 1970. The recent Commerce-SEC survey of spending
anticipations shows outlays for the second half of 1969 revised sharply
upward from earlier estimates, in contrast to the downward pattern of
revisions earlier this year. Also, a large rise is projected for the
first half of 1970 as utilities, communications, and, to a lesser extent,
durable goods manufacturers continue to increase their spending programs.
As currently planned, the average spending level in the first half of 1970
would be 6 per cent above the second half of 1969 and about 12 per
cent above the first half of 1969. Evidently, given current and pros-
pective weakness in growth of final demand, businessmen are willing to
accept lower profits and to carry excess capacity for a time in order
to prepare for ebullient future demands and as insurance against rapidly
rising unit labor costs and expected higher equipment prices.
The November Commerce-SEC survey indicates that businessmen
now plan to spend 11 per cent more in 1969 as a whole than in 1968--
a little higher than the 10.6 per cent gain noted in August but well
below the anticipated 14 per cent rise reported last February.

firms are planning especially large increases. Within manufacturing,
substantial gains are anticipated in the stone, clay, and glass,
chemical, and petroleum industries. Second quarter spending is pro-
jected to grow at a slower pace--$1.3 billion--with manufacturing
firms increasing more than nonmanufacturing.
The basic pattern of continued growth of spending by manu-
facturers revealed above is generally consistent with findings of the
third NICB survey of capital appropriations of the 1,000 largest
manufacturing firms. This survey showed that capital spending commit-
ments rose 3.7 per cent further in the third quarter--down sharply from
the 12.8 per cent second quarter gain. Since there is generally a six-
to twelve-month lag between appropriations and expenditures, this
survey would indicate further appreciable increases in manufacturers
outlays, with a possible slowdown after midyear.
Labor market. The unemployment rate fell to 3.4 per cent in
November from 3.9 per cent in October, the sharpest one-month decline
in the past decade. But the decline was not supported by other labor
market indicators, which suggested some further easing. Thus, manu-
facturing employment declined, employment growth in nonmanufacturing
continued slower than earlier in the year, the average workweek in
both manufacturing and nonmanufacturing continued at the lower October
levels, insured unemployment rose further, and jobless rates for blue-
collar and manufacturing workers continued significantly higher than
earlier in the year.

II -23
The drop in total unemployment occurred mainly among younger
workers and women. About one-fourth of the drop occurred among
persons who had been seeking part-time work, a large proportion had
never worked before, and almost all had been jobless for five weeks or
less. Moreover, about half the net decline in unemployment was
attributable to workers with drawing from the labor force, and the
labor force declined somewhat. Also, the reduction was concentrated
in the same labor force groups that accounted for the bulk of the sharp
jump of total unemployment in September. Unemployment levels and
rates for these "secondary" workers tend to be erratic on a month-to-
month basis and the economic significance of recent movements is
debatable.

For some segments of the "primary" labor force, however,
unemployment has risen progressively since the early part of the year.
These increases have occurred mainly among adult men with job
experience as blue-collar workers. Since most of these workers are
covered under unemployment insurance programs, the number of workers
drawing unemployment pay has increased and the most recent initial
claims figures suggest the continuation of a slow rate of rise. The
increases are attributable both to rising initial claims and to longer
spells of unemployment, and have paralleled the slow weakening of
manufacturing and residential construction employment.
Employment and earnings. Total nonfarm employment declined
slightly in November, as the GE strike kept about 130,000 workers
off payrolls, thereby offsetting further employment increases among
nonmanufacturing industries. (For purposes of measuring unemployment,
strikers are considered with a job but not at work. Thus, although
they are no longer on payrolls and therefore reduce the count of pay-
roll jobs, they are not counted as unemployed and have no direct
effect on the unemployment rate.)
Manufacturing employment showed signs of further weakness
in November, declining by 40,000 after allowance for the effects of
strike activity. Hours of work were unchanged from October (40.5 hours)
but down from the March high of 40.9 hours. In recent months, employ-
ment has declined somewhat in ordnance, lumber, autos, radio and TV,

II -25
apparel, textiles, and leather. Easing in these industries was offset
until recently by increases in primary metals, machinery, fabricated
metals and some segments of electrical equipment. However, manhours
worked in the latter industries have stabilized or trailed off
slightly since September (after crude allowance for strike effects),
suggesting some easing in this sector.

Personal income growth slowed in September and October as
relatively small employment gains coupled with the drop in the average
workweek held down the expansion of gross wages and salaries. With
employment gains continuing sluggish and many persons off payrolls
because of strikes, the rise in wages and salaries--and in personal
income--should be relatively small in November. At the same time, wage
increases continue large. In recent months, hourly earnings have
averaged about seven per cent higher than a year earlier, with increases
in nonmanufacturing running ahead of manufacturing.

II -26
Industrial relations. Railroad representatives and union
negotiators for the shopcraft unions reached agreement on a 2-year
contract on December 4. Full details of the agreement, which covers
1969 and 1970, are being withheld until it is ratified by the 48,000
members of 4 shopcraft unions. Preliminary reports indicate, however,
that these workers will receive an 11 per cent wage increase upon
ratification with provisions for retroactive payments. In addition,
the shopcraft unions will receive a 7 per cent wage increase in 1970,
with the bulk of that (5 per cent) effective January 1. Contracts
covering expire 400,000 other railroad workers.
The strike of 130,000 electrical workers at G.E. which
began October 27 continues and there have been no reports of any
progress toward a settlement.

II -27
Wholesale prices. An exceptionally large rise in prices of
farm products and a further substantial increase in prices of industrial
products pushed the wholesale price index up 0.6 per cent in November.
The rise in farm products was the first since June, and reflected to a
considerable extent a temporary spurt in volatile prices of perishable
goods. The rise in industrial commodities reflected a broad advance
with a continued large advance for nonferrous metals. A turnaround in
lumber and wood products prices (for which large declines had earlier
exerted a moderating influence on the overall price increase) added
strength to the upward movement in the average for industrial commodities.

Prices rose much more in November than had been reported in
the preliminary estimate. Prices of farm and food products rose 1.2 per
cent compared to 0.9 per cent in the preliminary report and the average
for industrial prices rose 0.4 per cent rather than the 0.2 per cent
originally estimated.

II -28
About one-quarter of the rise in industrial commodities was
the result of an increase of 0.4 per cent for machinery and equipment as
large increases were posted for agricultural, construction, and metal
working machinery. Prices of metals and metal products also rose 0.4
per cent and accounted for about one-fifth of the increase in industrial
commodities as nonferrous metals continued to rise sharply. A brisk
rise in prices of softwood plywood was primarily responsible for causing
the lumber and wood products group to rise for the first time since last
March. Prices for some chemicals, paper products, furniture, and tires
also increased, but gasoline, electric power, skins, and crude natural
rubber declined.
Since mid-November, a number of increases in metals prices
have been announced. Lead prices have been raised, and a further
increase for this metal is widely expected as is an advance for zinc.
Copper fabricators have raised prices as they have been forced to use
increasing amounts of raw material from higher-priced sources. A recent
increase in tin has resulted in the highest price since November 1965,
and cadmium prices have advanced to an all-time high.
The increased cost of nickel resulting from the settlement of
the strike in Canada has been reflected in U.S. producers' announcement
of increases of from 4-1/2 to 5-1/2 per cent in the prices of stainless
steel products, effective in mid-December. This will be offset in con-
siderable part, however, by reductions of perhaps 2-5 per cent for many
steel sheet products by a new method of billing, effective on January 1.

II -29
Complicating the computation of price change is the addition of "extra"
charges to be applied in February to shipments under the new steel pric-
ing method.
A review of industrial prices for the past year shows a wide
dispersion of price increases, with metals and metal products prices
rising at over twice the rate of products of any other industry.
Several major industries, including some labor-intensive ones, have had
relatively low rates of price rise. Of the 13 major industrial groups,
6 have increased less than 3.5 per cent, compared to 3.9 per cent for
the average, and 4 have increased at a rate of 2 per cent or less, as
shown below.

II -30
On the other hand, iron and steel prices rose 7.3 per cent, steel mill
products 6.7 per cent, and nonferrous metals 19.6 per cent. Nonferrous
metals are extremely sensitive to world demand levels and have been
heavily affected by labor and political troubles.
The small--one per cent--increase in chemical prices can
perhaps be attributed to low labor intensity, fast technological pro-
gress, and over-capacity in the industry. The small increases in whole-
sale prices of furniture and textiles, on the other hand, probably reflect
the strong demand situation.
Debts of farm operators. The estimated 6.7 per cent increase
in farm debt during fiscal 1969 was the smallest annual increase of this
decade. The slower growth reflected various constraints on both
borrowers and lenders, and perhaps some underestimation, as explained
below. From the partial information available on new loans made and
mortgages recorded, it appears that lending activity slackened in late
1968 and then picked up moderately in 1969, except at insurance companies
and the Farmers Home Administration (direct loans). Repayments were
normal and foreclosures negligible. Lending trends through September
appear similar to those of January-June.
Among the important elements in the farm credit market in
fiscal 1969 were scarcity of funds at some lenders, competition from
nonfarm borrowers for available funds, farmer resistance to high interest
rates, low usury ceilings in some states, and, earlier in the year,
gloomy prospects for net farm earnings. But earning prospects changed

II -31
dramatically in the spring of 1969 when livestock product prices climbed
sharply to highs which they have sustained since. Net farm income for
1969 forecast by the USDA as late as February at less than the $14.9
billion of 1968, jumped to $16.3 billion (seasonally adjusted annual
rate) in the second quarter, and is now expected to total $16.0 billion
for the year.
The improved earnings outlook undoubtedly contributed to the
pick-up in overall lending activity that began in the spring of 1969.
Yet lagging sales of farm machinery and a continued deceleration in land
value increases suggest that reduced credit availability and high
interest rates were offsetting influences.
Differences in farm loan growth rates among lending institu-
tions resulted from differing availability of funds. Direct loans by
the Farmers Home Administration showed no increase as the agency had
limited funds and turned increasingly to its insured real estate loan
program. Insurance company balances rose only nominally as the com-
panies allocated fewer funds to farm mortgages and made virtually no
loans in states with low usury ceilings. On the other hand, the Federal
land banks, exempt from state usury laws and with ready access to funds
through sales of bonds, expanded outstanding mortgage loans by 10 per
cent. Banks also increased their holdings of farm real-estate-secured
loans by 10 per cent, but some of this rise may have consisted of pur-
chases of loans insured by the Farmers Home Administration.
Expansion of farm production credit slowed relatively more at
banks than at production credit associations. The gain over the fiscal

II -32
year at banks was 5.7 per cent, compared to the most recent five-year
average annual rate of 7.6 per cent. Outstanding loans at the PCA's,
which obtain their funds from sales of debentures, rose by 11.4 per cent,
compared to their five-year average of 12.4 per cent.
In the opinion of many observers, increased credit from non-
reporting lenders, particularly land-contract credit from sellers of
farms, has recently tended to compensate for reduced credit availability
from lending institutions (especially life insurance companies). Unfor-
tunately, there are no hard data on activity of nonreporting lenders.
Estimates shown in the table assume that their relative role has
remained unchanged since the benchmark provided by the 1960 Census.
Increases in total farm debt during fiscal 1969 and other recent tight-
money periods may therefore have been underestimated.

THE ECONOMIC PICTUPE IN DETAIL
Bank credit. Commercial bank credit increased $2.4 billion
in November. The gain, the largest since April, was mainly the
result of a sharp and for the most part probably temporary increase
in holdings of securities other than U.S. Treasury issues and in loans
to security dealers. The latter reflected in part a $370 million
matched sale-purchase arrangement with the System at month-end. Trends
in most other loan categories were moderate to weak, and holdings of
U.S. Treasury securities declined further.
With the sharp advance in holdings of other securities,
banks recorded their first monthly increase in investment holdings
of the year in November. A significant part of this rise apparently
was the result of a buildup in inventories of municipal securities
(and in some instances of Federal Agency issues) at dealer banks
and reflected the difficulties encountered in distributing new
issues to final investors. The net decline in U.S. Government
securities was much smaller than in the previous two months,
reflecting bank underwriting of the $2.5 billion tax bill financing
(carrying full tax and loan credit) on the last reporting date
of the month.

Loans rose substantially in November exceeding the fairly
strong increase recorded in October. However, as in October, growth
in loans to security dealers accounted for nearly half of the total
increase. Moreover, the volume of loan sales to subsidiaries and
affiliates, which amounted to nearly $950 million in October, fell
to about a third of that amount in November.
Business loans remained unchanged and, even after adjustment
for the outright sale of $200 million of such loans, the rate of growth
in these loans was down markedly from other recent months. The volume
of securities sold by corporations in the capital market was quite
large in November, which may partly explain this weakening. In
addition, many firms, expecting bank credit conditions to become
progressively tighter later in the year, may have satisfied a good
part of their fourth quarter needs in October--when business loans
went up $1.1 billion and sales of business loans to affiliates
totaled $700 million. However,with the business needs for outside
financing remaining strong, it seems unlikely that business loan
developments in December will remain as weak as in November. According
to the latest lending practices survey, most banks are expecting
demands for loans to remain about unchanged or to strengthen over
the next three months (See Appendix C for more detailed discussion
of survey.)

III -4
Bank liquidity. The liquidity position of large commercial
banks measured by the ratio of liquid assets to total liabilities
less capital accounts and valuation reserves increased slightly in
November (see chart). But a large part of the increase, associated
with the tax bill financing on November 26 and the recent growth in
loans to security dealers, presumably will be temporary. If bank
acquisition of the tax bills were excluded, the ratio would have
remained essentially unchanged from its October level, which was the
low mark for the year. This ratio has declined almost continuously
this year and is now below the level that prevailed during the 1966
credit crunch.
Bank sources of funds. The funds to finance the November
growth in bank credit were supplied primarily by deposit inflows.
U.S. Treasury deposits advanced sharply in conjunction with two
major Treasury financing operations to account for a considerable
part of this growth. Private demand deposits also advanced moderately
during the month while time deposits remained essentially unchanged.
At large banks, total time and savings deposits extended
their long standing downtrend although the November decline was
somewhat smaller than in recent months, New York banks continued
to be successful in attracting foreign official funds to their
negotiable CD's, and banks in other cities experienced a rate of
attrition in their CD's more moderate than in other recent months.

III -7
Consumer-type time and savings deposits, in contrast, fell sharply
further at large commercial banks--partly because of reduction in
Christmas Club accounts--and accounted for more than half of the
decline in total time and savings deposits. Country banks also
experienced a continued sharp outflow in their time and savings
deposits during November.
Use of nondeposit sources of funds expanded substantially
further in November as banks tapped the Euro-dollar market for a
large block of funds. The commercial paper market again serves
as a source of funds but the November advance was only about a third
as large as the $1.2 billion October increase.
Money stock developments. The money stock increased at
a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.8 per cent in November and
this advance lifted the rate of growth since midyear to 1.1 per
cent. For the year to date, the money stock has increased at a
2.9 per cent annual rate. An increase in public currency holdings
has accounted for nearly half of the growth in the money supply
since the beginning of the year. And since midyear, growth in
currency has been even more important, offsetting as it has a decline
in the demand deposit component of the money supply.

III -8
Nonbank depositary intermediaries. The preliminary
information now available suggests that during November, thrift
institutions received modest inflows reminiscent more of the
reduced third quarter pace than of the sharply constricted October
pattern. While the MSB data are biased upward by seasonal adjustment
problems, the pattern of modest growth at mutual savings banks
apparently continued in early December, at least at the New York
institutions. The data now available probably pre-date any with-
drawals that would occur as a result of the reported heavy subscrip-
tion by individual investors of recent public corporate bond offerings.

Reflecting the weakness in deposit inflows, liquidity at both
the S&Ls and the savings banks has been reduced, at least through October.
In both cases, ratios of liquid assets to deposits have reached new
lows./ In addition, mutual savings banks have reduced on net their
holdings of corporate securities, through the third quarter, at least
in New York, they also increased their reliance on borrowings, as
outright loans from commercial banks, mortgage warehousing, and repur-
chase agreements (both for securities and mortgages) were important
supplements to their reduced funds available to honor commitments.

was reduced by the FHLBB in November from 6 per cent to 5.5 per
cent of outstanding deposits.

Similarly, savings and loan associations have continued to
borrow from the FHLBanks, with the growth in outstanding advances for
1969 through November amounting to $3.5 billion, far more than in any
other year. At the end of November, the FHLB System held $1.4 billion
in liquid assets available for lending and it has recently announced
that it will break precedent and issue securities during December to
raise $250 million of additional funds. The FHLBB also has authority
to borrow up to $1 billion from the Treasury and a bill now in Congress
would raise that to $4 billion.1967 Q

Mortgage market. FNMA in recent weeks has continued to be a
major source of support to the market for Government underwritten
mortgages. While the volume of auction bids submitted to FNMA has
remained below the weekly average reached early last summer when the
real estate market was more active, FNMA since mid-November has stepped
up its weekly approval of forward purchase commitments on home
mortgages to an annual rate of about $6.3 billion. This was somewhat
above the volume in late October and early November when mortgage
yields declined temporarily. In addition, FNMA has made commitments
through direct negotiation for the purchase of FHA multifamily mortgages
at an annual rate of approximately $450 million.

III -12
With take downs rising because of its enlarged commitment back-
log, FNMA in early December issued $650 million in debentures, of which
$100 million was net new money. As in other recent months, the net cost
of this financing to FNMA was considerably higher than the net yields
to FNMA on either its recent portfolio additions or its total mortgage
holdings.
While returns on new issues of high-grade corporate bonds have
risen sharply in recent weeks, average secondary-market yields on FHA
and VA home-loan commitments approved in FNMA's auction have increased
more slowly. In the December 8 auction, average yields nevertheless
reached a new high that was well above the usury ceilings of 8 per
cent or less applying principally to conventional home mortgages that
still prevail in 21 States and the District of Columbia. The slower
rise in home mortgage yields available to lenders has partly reflected
the already-deep discounts on FHA and VA loans, which in turn have
become an increasing barrier to originating new Federally underwritten
mortgages.

was May 6, 1968.
Reflecting mainly savings losses experienced again in October,
New York State mutual savings banks (which account for three-fifths of the
assets of all savings banks) apparently cut back the volume of their
new mortgage commitments approved during that month. The October volume
of new commitments was about 7 per cent below the reduced rate reached
in the third quarter. The outstanding mortgage commitments of NYSMSB's
edged down for the sixth consecutive month, after adjustment for seasonal
variation, and at the end of October were 17 per cent below last
April's peak. Moreover, owing in part to the efforts of savings banks
to ease demands on their cash flow over the near term, an unusually
low proportion (three-fifths) of their end-of-October backlog of
mortgage commitments was scheduled for take down within the next 9
months.

III -14
Corporate security and municipal bond markets. Capital
market yields rose to new all-time highs in the first week of December
as a result of the heavy supply of new issues and selective buying by
institutional investors. In the three weeks from November 14 to
December 5 corporate and tax-exempt long-term yields rose about 50
basis points. In recent days these record yields, which included a
better-than-9 per cent return on a Aaa issue, attracted an unusual
volume of individual investors and some institutional interest,
permitting dealers to work down inventory backlogs. But despite
the resultant marginal increase in bond prices, it seems unlikely that
any basic change in market attitudes or supply and demand factors
has taken place as yet.

Stock prices and volume of trading continued their November
decline into the second week of December. At their closing on
December 8, the New York and American Stock Exchange stock price indices
were both at their lowest points in two months, all of the gains made
during the October rally having been erased. Although these two
indices still were above their July 29 lows, the blue-chip oriented
Dow Jones Industrial Average had fallen below the 800 level for the
first time since January 1967.
Because a $100 million utility issue was postponed, the
volume of public bond offerings fell short of the earlier
staff estimate for November. But stock issues rose above $1 billion,
bringing total corporate security offerings in November to $2.5 billion,
the highest monthly volume since April of 1969. The increase in stock
issues reflected three large rights offerings and rapid growth in the
number of issues by small and medium-sized companies turning to the
equity markets for funds even in the face of declining prices.
The public bond calendar for December built up quickly, and
the staff estimate of such offerings has been raised to $1.1 billion.
With seasonal increases in private placement takedowns, total corporate
security issues in December are now estimated to be about $2.3 billion,
even though the Christmas holidays will curtail activity in the markets
during the last half of the month.

Public bond offerings in January are now expected to reach
$1.3 billion, the highest monthly issue volume in over a year. Utility
financing needs remaining pressing, as indicated by the large number
of scheduled issues and recent filings and by capital spending plans
In addition both balance sheet considerations and reports by underwriters
indicate that a number of industrial firms are now quite likely to come
to market in the first months of 1970 in an effort to fund the abnormally
large current volume of short-term financing, to rebuild depleted
liquidity, and to finance capital outlays which continue high with further
increases anticipated by business.

III -17
State and local government long-term financing is still being
constrained by legal ceilings that are below market rates in some areas,
but the market has found difficulty in absorbing even the relatively
reduced supply of new issues because of the continued lack of support
from commercial banks. December long-term offerings are estimated to
total approximately $600 million, even after taking into account several
large postponements. As in the corporate market, the seasonal reduction
in volume of new issues in the latter part of December should help
dealers work down inventories to more comfortable levels.
The potential volume of borrowing by State and local govern-
ments and lack of bank support could limit any decline in rates that
might otherwise be produced by seasonal factors this month. January
long-term municipal securities sales are expected to rise to $900
million. The December-January calendar contains a number of issues
by special authorities who apparently feel that revenue prospects
and user needs justify payment of record interest rates. While some major
borrowers are out of the market at current yields, others, such as
New York City, will continue to be active in the long-term area. More-
over, maturities of recent short-term borrowings may now be forcing
some issuers back into the long-term market, with authorities running
into legal restrictions on refunding of short-term debt.

Government securities market. Interest rates in the Treasury
security market showed mixed changes following the November 25 meeting
of the Committee. Long-term coupon yields pushed higher on balance as
investors switched to attractive new corporate issues; and rates on
short- and intermediate-term notes and bonds also moved higher. In
part in reflection of seasonal influences, yields on Treasury bills
due in 3 months or less continued to rise, with the 3-month issue reach-
ing a new high of 7.84 on December 9. In contrast, longer-term bill
rates adjusted lower from the record levels reached just prior to the
series of weekly, monthly, and tax bill auctions at the end of November.

Greatly enlarged dealer bill positions, in the face of only
moderate demandsandhigh financing costs, continue to maintain bill
rates at generally advanced, and in some instances record, levels.
Total dealer positions in Treasury bills have risen to the highest
levels seen this year. At the same time, the volume of long-term
repurchase agreements made by the dealers has remained relatively stable
in the $650-$750 million range prevailing since late October. As a
result, dealers have been particularly sensitive to higher day-to-day
financing costs of around 10 per cent in New York and 9 per cent at
sources away from the major money market banks.

Price and yield changes in the Treasury note and bond market
have reflected intermitte.nt demands in the intermediate-term sector
and, in longer maturities, reaction to developments in the corporate
bond market. Dealerspositions in all categories of coupon issues have
increased on balance since late November, but remain relatively small
by past standards.
In the market for Federal Agency obligations, the lull in new
offerings between the November 19 FICB issue and the $650 million FNMA
financing on December 2 allowed dealers to make a little progress in
reducing their positions in Agency securities without further price
concessions. In fact, yields on Agency issues moved slightly lower in
late November in line with similar Treasury issues. Recently, however,

III -21
the Agency market showed some temporary signs of weakness when the
19- and 39-month FNMA issues, offered to yield 8.60 and 8.30 per cent,
respectively, were not well received and moved to discounts.
Other Short-Term Credit Markets, Rates on private short-
term credit instruments continued to increase in the latter half of
November, although in most instances not by as much as the upward
movement in similar maturities of Treasury bill rates. Rates on 3-
and 6-month commercial paper advanced by 25 basis points to 8.75
as of December 5; and, after remaining steady since early October,
posted rates on 3- and 6-month finance company paper adjusted to
the generally higher level of other short-term rates in late November.
Most recently, however, quotations on finance paper have moved back
down to early November levels. Rates on finance paper with maturities
of less than 3-months, where most of the volume of recent issue
activity reportedly has been located, have also increased since mid-
November, with the composite range of offered rates reported in New
York Reserve Bank's series on 30-59 day finance paper moving from 7-3/4--
8 per cent to 8-1/8--8-1/2 per cent on December 4.
Note: The latest figures available on commercial and finance company
paper outstanding report that in October such paper rose by nearly
$1.8 billion, seasonally adjusted, to a level of $32.0 billion,
an increase of 6 per cent in outstanding paper, compared with
increases of 4 per cent and 5 per cent in August and September, respec-
tively. Bank related paper increased by more than 40 per cent
(seasonally unadjusted) in October and totaled $3.6 billion at the
end of the month. By November 26, bank-related paper had risen to
$4 billion.

Federal finance. Board staff estimates of total Federal
receipts for fiscal 1970 have been raised $900 million to $196.2 billion
since last Greenbook, reflecting somewhat higher estimates of
corporate profits in the first half of next year. Staff expenditures
estimates for fiscal 1970, which allow for only a 10 per cent
increase in Social Security benefits effective April 1, remain
unchanged at $192.9 billion. The estimated surplus has therefore
been lifted to $3.3 billion, or $.47 billion on an NIA BAsis.

III -24
If the revenue changes recently voted by the Senate were
to be enacted, the Staff's estimate of receipts could be cut back by
nearly $1.5 billion; but at this point the staff is assuming that the
House version of tax relief and reform is more likely to be enacted.
This would cause no attrition in fiscal 1970 receipts relative to
earlier Budget estimates. Congress and the Administration. may,
of course, reach a compromise that does tend to erode receipts
even in fiscal 1970. The range of possible results that could
emerge from present Congressional deliberations is discussed in
Appendix B.
On the outlays side, recently voted Senate changes in Social
Security benefits would add more than $1 billion in expenditures to
the staff estimates for fiscal 1970, as shown in the Appendix.
On the other hand, the Administration cut of $3 billion from its initial
defense budget estimate, which the staff has been including in its
expenditure estimates, has become more certain. Defense contract
awards, a leading indicator of spending, were modest in October, for
the seventh month in a row, and a$5.3 billion cut in 1970 defense
appropriations just voted by the House highlights the stiffened
resolve of Congress to reduce military outlays.
The Treasury's cash balance at the end of December is now
projected to be $5.9 billion. This is $600 million below the estimate
in the last Greenbook, with most of the shortfall arising from the
expected redemption of a temporary special Treasury issue purchased

III -25
by the FHLBB. At the time of the last Greenbook, the staff was not
aware that the unexpectedly improved late November level of the
Treasury cash balance was largely attributable to this temporary
FHLBB investment.
Strong quarterly income tax payments and five assumed $100
million supplements to weekly bill auctions are expected to swell the
Treasury balance to $6.6 billion by the end of January. Thus, no
additional cash financing by the Treasury is expected to be needed
until early March. Unexpectedly large increases in advances to
S and L's could force the FHLBB to draw on its $1 billion special
borrowing privilege at the Treasury during the January reinvestment
period. The Treasury would probably still not need to borrow in
January to cover this drain; but if the FHLBB borrowing were not
quickly repaid from the proceeds of FHLBB market borrowing in January,
the Treasury might have to advance its cash financing from March
to February.

THE ECONOMIC PICTURE IN DETAIL
International Developments
U.S. balance of payments. The October liquidity deficit, not
seasonally adjusted, is now reported at $840 million, rather than the
$690 million estimated on the basis of earlier partial data. After
seasonal adjustment the October deficit would still be large at about
$400 million, but this is still consistent with the view that the fourth
quarter rate of deficit will be much lower than the exaggerated rates in
the earlier quarters of the year. Weekly data for November suggest a
quite small liquidity deficit for that month, after adjustment for adverse
seasonality.
Although the expected improvement in the fourth quarter seems
to be occurring, there is little evidence that this reflects any decisive
gain in basic transactions. The improvement appears to depend mainly on
such relatively volatile elements as return flows from Euro-dollar and
Deutschemark assets, a spurt in foreign purchases of U.S. equities in
October, and year-end inflows by direct investors.
In October the trade surplus was lower than in September;
exports were behaving well, but imports were apparently still under the
influence of strong U.S. demand. Another negative factor in October was
an increase of $145 million in bank-reported claims on foreigners, as a
sizable reduction in short-term claims on Japan was more than offset by
increased lending to a number of European countries and to Canada.

IV -2
However, foreign net purchases of U.S. corporate stocks surged to $350
million in October, continuing a recovery from the net liquidations of
June and July. This large inflow was no doubt related to the short-lived
turnaround in the U.S. equity market; since October share prices have
tended down, while Euro-dollar interest rates have risen sharply.
The full set of balance of payments tables just prepared for
the third quarter (confidential until released at the end of December)
indicate that outflows of corporate capital in that period were still
an important factor in the deficits, and also that there were probably
additional large outflows (unidentified) of U.S. funds for placement in
Euro-dollars (especially in July) and in Deutschemark assets. In the
first nine months of this year, the net identified outflow of corporate
capital amounted to nearly $2 billion, compared to $1.2 billion in the
same period of 1968. The outflow for direct investment averaged over
$1 billion per quarter, a little higher than last year, and included
about the same amount of foreign funds derived from new issues sold
abroad -- about $150 million per quarter. However, this year corporations
have increased their short-term assets abroad (apart from the proceeds of
foreign borrowing) rather than liquidating them as they did last year,
and their borrowing abroad has been much smaller.
It remains to be seen whether there will be once again a major
inflow in the last weeks of the year. There is some evidence that corporate
borrowing abroad began to rise in the third quarter, and is intensifying

in the fourth, as corporations position themselves to meet any need to
return funds to the United States to stay within the Commerce Department
regulations. High borrowing costs and the weakened market for convertible
issues are probably discouraging any tendency to repatriate more than the
required amounts, as was done last year.
An unexpected aspect of the third-quarter accounts was a rise
in income receipts from direct investments to a record $1.5 billion.
For the first nine months of the year such receipts totaled $4.3 billion,
a gain of over $1/2 billion over the like period in 1968. The increase
probably reflects improved earnings and perhaps also a desire to meet
the control targets by reducing reinvested foreign earnings.

IV -4
The supposition that other short-term outflows were continuing
in the third quarter is based on the large negative residual item of
$.9 billion that persisted in the accounts -- although this was a bit
lower than the residuals of the first or second quarter. Direct
statistical evidence that such flows were occurring is lacking, at least
until Bank of England data on liabilities of banks in the U.K. are
available. Similarly, it will be some time before the extent of any
return flows after September can be determined, though the reduced
liquidity deficits imply they are fairly large.
On the official settlements basis, the U.S. balance of payments
shifted into surplus in November. In October, U.S. banks had reduced
their borrowings from branches, but there had been a substantial inflow
of funds from Canadian and other foreign commercial banks, making the
U.S. balance for October less unfavorable on the official settlements
basis than on the liquidity basis. In November, U.S. banks' liabilities
to branches increased sharply, by an estimated $1 billion. From
November 19 to December 3, however, there was relatively little net
change in these liabilities. The outstanding total as of December 3 was
$15.1 billion without including foreign branch participations in head
office domestic loans, and $15.3 billion if those are included. This
compares with a peak of $15.4 billion (on the latter basis) at mid-October,
and an average level during August and September of around $15 billion.
Recent enlargement of U.S. banks' takings of Euro-dollar funds might

IV -5
have been greater were it not for the continued strength in foreign
official demand for time deposit holdings at U.S. banks. These holdings
increased about $130 million in the three weeks ending December 3 -- for
a total increase of about $1.6 billion from early September. The rates
offered by U.S. banks for (90 to 179 days) foreign official time deposit
funds ranged from 9-5/8 to 11 per cent as of Monday, December 1, compared
to a range of 9-5/8 to 10-3/4 per cent the previous Monday.
According to incomplete data, from December 3 to Monday, December 8,
liabilities to branches declined by-about $500 million.
Euro-dollar market. Euro-dollar interest rates tended to rise
irregularly during November and increased rather sharply near the end of
the first week of December. The three-month rate, for example, which
averaged about 10-3/4 per cent in the second half of November, reached
11-5/16 per cent on December 8 before receding to 10-7/8 per cent as of
December 10.

The market has been affected by the Bundesbank's action on
December 4 of increasing its Lombard rate by 1-1/2 per cent to 9 per
cent per annum to encourage German banks to reduce their net foreign
assets, rather than depend on advances from the Bundesbank to meet
approaching yearend liquidity requirements. Also, yearend window-
dressing repatriations by commercial banks in Switzerland are perhaps
already being reflected in Euro-dollar rates. The Swiss National Bank
has offered short-dated swaps in unlimited amounts to Swiss banks over
the yearend. This will contribute to larger Swiss withdrawls from the
Euro-dollar market than would occur without such a facility. The impact
of these withdrawals on Euro-dollar rates will be damped, however, to
the extent that the Swiss National Bank makes Euro-dollar placements
for its own account.
Foreign exchange markets. The Bundesbank continued to sell
large amounts of dollars until seasonal liquidity pressures in German
financial markets together with new policy actions forced commercial
banks in early December to begin repatriating funds invested abroad.
Most other major central banks had moderate gains in reserves in late
November; in the past week changes have been small.
The Bundesbank continued to suffer heavy losses of reserves
very early in December. Its sales of dollars had tended to taper off
during the last two weeks of November -- averaging about $400 million
a week, compared with an average of about $800 million a week during
the first half of the month -- but in the first two trading days of

IV -7
December it sold a further $455 million. This brought total Bundesbank
sales of dollars since September 30 -- the day the mark rate was cut
loose to float -- to $5.2 billion. The net drain on Bundesbank
reserves from all market transactions was $4.3 billion; the Bank received
$885 million from maturing forward contracts between October 1 and
December 10. The actual decline in reserves during this period was
$4.1 billion -- as shown in the table below -- which reflects the receipt
in October of a little more than $200 million purchased during the last
two days of September.
The heavy drain on Bundesbank liquid dollar holdings prompted
it to draw on unrestricted funds available from the IMF. On November 26
the Bundesbank drew $540 million of various currencies from its super-
gold tranche at the Fund, and this week it drew $550 million, representing
funds which it had lent the Fund under the GAB. At about $8.1 billion,
German reserves are now about the same as at the end of 1967 before heavy
speculation on a DM revaluation began.

The Bundesbank announced two policy actions on December 4:
(1) a general reduction in minimum reserve requirements for commercial
banks for the month of December, aimed at easing the seasonal pressures
in domestic money markets, and (2) as noted in the Euro-dollar discussion
above, an increase in its Lombard rate -- the rate charged for advances
to banks -- from 7-1/2 to 9 per cent. (The rediscount rate remains at
6 per cent, but rediscount quotas have not been increased). Following
these moves, the mark exchange rate rose sharply to its highest point
since revaluation, although it did not reach its new par level, and
Bundesbank reserves have been unchanged. It seems clear that the objective
in raising the Lombard rate was to check the reserve drain.
The decline in Bundesbank reserves over the past two months
produced a sharp contraction of liquidity in the German banking system.
Call money rates in Frankfurt rose from 1-1/2 per cent at the end of
September to around 6 to 6-1/2 per cent two months later, and currently
are around 10 per cent. The three-month interbank loan rate in Frankfurt
reached a recent peak on December 9 of 10-11 per cent per annum -- about
in line with the current 3-month Euro-dollar rate. The German rates
would undoubtedly have gone higher before the end of the year if the
Bundesbank had not taken the actions it did.
Since September 30, major Western European central banks have
purchased, net, about $2.3 billion in their respective exchange markets.
This accounts for a little more than one-half of the net drain on
Bundesbank reserves during the same period.

IV -9
Demand for sterling continues firm. The Bank of England
purchased a small amount of dollars during the past three weeks, but
its recent dollar purchases have been considerably lower than in early
November. During the month of November the Bank of England purchased
a total $525 million in the market, roughly the same as it purchased
during October.
The Swiss franc exchange rate rose sharply during the past
three weeks, like the German mark reflecting seasonal liquidity pressures
in domestic financial markets and repatriation of assets from abroad by
commercial banks. The French franc exchange rate has firmed moderately
since mid-November and the Bank of France has purchased dollars from
time to time. During November it purchased about $230 million. Other
major purchasers of dollars in November were the Bank of Italy and the
National Bank of Belgium, each purchasing about $100 million.
U.S. foreign trade. The export surplus diminished in October
as imports rose more than exports. For September-October together,
however, the surplus (balance of payments basis) was $2.0 billion at
an annual rate, considerably better than the $0.8 billion rate in
July-August and the small deficit recorded in the first half of the
year.
Exports have been rising strongly. In September-October
combined they were at an annual rate of $39.3 billion (balance of
payments basis) about 3 per cent above the July-August rate, and up
nearly 15 per cent from a year earlier. Less certain is the recent

IV -10
trend of imports where monthly variations have been large. Imports
in September-October were at a $37.3 billion rate, about the same
as in the preceding two months but imports in October were the highest
since May.
The export rise in September-October included both agricultural
and nonagricultural commodities. Shipments of agricultural products
have been surprisingly strong. For September-October together such
shipments were 6.5 per cent greater than the relatively high level of
the two preceding months and accounted for about one-third of the rise
in total exports. Soybeans and tobacco led this most recent expansion;
cotton shipments have sagged badly, while lower wheat prices have held
down the value of grain shipments. The heavy foreign takings of soybeans
reflected not only the bumper crop in the U.S. and the resultant lower
prices but also higher prices of competing high protein foreign oils --
sunflowerseed oil from East Europe and fishmeal from Peru -- as supplies
from these alternative sources have become more limited.
The advance in exports of nonagricultural products in September-
October was concentrated in automobiles and parts to Canada, and in
machinery and metals -- including steel, aluminum and copper. The outlook
for further improvement in sales of machinery is particularly bright
as export orders jumped again in October. Exports of steel, mainly to
Germany and to the other EEC countries, accelerated further in October,
when the monthly tonnage of shipments was the greatest in more than 15
years. Steel exports for this year are now expected to be close to

-11-
5 million tons, more than double the 1968 tonnage and the greatest
volume since 1957. Demand in Europe is extremely strong and export
prices of some steel categories in these countries are reportedly
higher than internal prices for the first time in more than 12 years.
Tightness in European steel supplies has also improved our marketing
position in Latin America. Increased steel shipments to Canada reflect
shortages there due to strikes earlier in the year.
By areas, the export rise in September-October was in ship-
ments to Canada (principally automotive equipment), Japan and Australia,
New Zealand and South Africa. Total sales to Europe held at the very
high level of July-August, with a dip in exports to the United Kingdom
offset by a small rise in shipments to the EEC countries. Exports to
Latin America also showed little change. The further expansion in
shipments to Japan in September-October above the high level of the
preceding two months was, in part, attributable to larger shipments
of soybeans.
In world trade in manufactured goods (final products and
materials), the U.S. share in the third quarter improved over the low
average of the first two quarters but it is still not back to the share
of 1968. Japan's share of world trade in these types of goods has
continued to improve this year while the shares of Germany, the United
Kingdom and France have changed only slightly. Japan this year has
replaced the United Kingdom as the third leading exporter of manufactures
ranking behind Germany and the United States.

IV -12
Although total imports in September-October were no higher
than in the preceding two months, there were mixed movements in the
principal commodity categories. Arrivals of nonfood consumer goods and
capital equipment continued heavy, but imports of foods and beverages and
semifabricated industrial materials fell off; the latter reflects limited
supplies of nickel and copper from Canada as a result of the strike in
Canadian nickel plants which began in July and did not end until November.
The reduced volume of imports of these metals have been offset, in part,
by higher metal prices. Import prices of copper in September and October
were nearly 15 per cent greater than in July-August. The announced 25
per cent rise in the price of nickel with the termination of the strike
can be expected to further boost the value of imported metals in the
coming months. Purchases of foreign chemicals and crude materials such
as woodpulp and natural rubber have continued strong, in spite of the
easing in domestic industrial activity.
Imports of automobiles in September-October were up sharply
from the levels of the two preceding months, especially from Canada.
Despite the production of 275,000 Mavericks in the first eleven months
of this year -- 60 per cent of the units were produced in Canada --
sales of European and Japanese cars in the United States in January-
November were 8 per cent greater than in the corresponding period of
1968.

IV -13
Price developments in major industrial countries. Since the
beginning of the year, price advances at both wholesale and retail levels
have been substantial in most of the major industrial countries. Wholesale
prices for manufactured goods rose strongly through the third quarter in
all of the industrial countries except Canada and the Netherlands. The
rise in consumer prices generally slowed except in Japan and Italy. Demand
was the principal element in generating inflationary pressures except in
the United Kingdom, where cost increases were predominant. In Italy,
rising labor costs were also important.

For the period ahead, significant cost-push pressures that could
lead to intensified rates of price inflation during 1970 are developing
in all the major European countries and Canada. In Japan, however, only
moderate pressure on prices from increased costs appears likely and some
probable abatement of investment demand could lead to a decrease in the
pace of price advances.

IV -15
The revaluation of the German mark, while helping to dampen
inflationary tendencies in Germany, is likely to have the opposite
effect in neighboring countries whose trade with the Federal Republic
is a significant proportion of total national income. The cost-push
effect in Germany's major trading partners of a rise in the price of
imports from Germany due to the parity change should be fairly immediate,
whereas the induced higher German demand for the output of these countries
will have a more gradual and continuing price influence. Countries which
might experience a potential upward push in their GNP deflator of 1 per cent
or more within a relatively short time are Austria, the Netherlands and
Switzerland; Belgium would be somewhat less affected.
The inflationary effects of the German boom were finally beginning
to show in the months preceding the DM appreciation. From June to October,
producers' prices for industrial products rose at an annual rate of over
7 per cent, significantly above the average annual rise of 2 per cent in the
previous boom period that ran from the end of 1963 to April 1966. Increases
were general, with the largest in the prices of capital goods.
The non-food cost-of-living index jumped 0.6 per cent in October.
The year-to-year increase of 2.4 per cent, however, is still less than the
average annual rise in overall consumer prices over the past 10 years.
Recent price advances at the production and retail levels also reflect,
in part, increases deferred until after the national elections in September.
Export prices rose 5.5 per cent between the fourth quarter of
1968 and the third quarter of this year. The border tax adjustments of
November 1968, not rescinded until after the revaluation of the German

IV -16
mark, accounted for some of this increase, but export prices were still
climbing at about a 6 per cent annual rate during the past two quarters.
The sharp rise in the third quarter also reflected concentration of
foreign demand during August and September in anticipation of the
revaluation.
Despite the high level of demand placed on fully utilized
productive resources, price increases were relatively moderate until
mid-year, primarily because labor productivity in industry was continuing
to increase, thereby contributing to a decrease in unit labor costs of
production. This is changing as wage demands become more intense and as
the high degree of capacity utilization takes its toll on productivity.
Several wildcat strikes occurred in the autumn in steel and other industries,
and a settlement in the steel industry resulted in a 12 per cent wage
increase. Hourly earnings in the fourth quarter are expected to show a
year-to-year increase of around 12 per cent, which compares with an increase
of about 8 per cent from mid-1968 to mid-1969. The Bundesbank expects
unit labor costs to rise substantially, perhaps by as much as 6-8 per cent,
through the summer of 1970. But even a rise of this magnitude would only
bring unit labor costs back to their mid-1967 level. The rise in unit
labor costs should be offset--in part at least--by the downward adjustment
of raw material costs after revaluation.
The Economics Ministry estimates that consumer prices will rise
at only a 2-1/2 to 3 per cent rate during 1970 despite these cost pressures.
The anticipated slowdown in the German rate of growth in the letter part

IV -17
of next year could moderate price advances, but the unfolding impact of
the revaluation may be more significant. The parity change should decrease
foreign demand for German products, which has been important in the boom,
while increased import competition should lessen the propensity of German
producers to pass on cost increases to the consumer. Furthermore, once
the special arrangements for subsidy payments to German farmers concluded
by the government and the EEC Commission become effective--as is expected
to occur on January 1--food prices should drop significantly in Germany.
Despite very little economic growth in the United Kingdom this
year, price and wage advancesduring this second year after devaluation
have been faster than during the latter part of 1968,after the initial
impact of the November 1967 devaluation had been felt. Consumer prices
are rising at about a 5 per cent annual rate and wholesale prices at more
than 3 per cent per annum.
The rise in consumer prices partly reflects indirect tax increases
intended to help divert resources to export production. The British
authorities have in fact deliberately engineered price increases for
domestic consumer goods by twice raising indirect taxes since November 1968.
Export prices rose only 2.4 per cent between the third quarters of 1968
and 1969, an increase not large enough to have caused loss of British
export price competitiveness.
Potentially severe cost pressures due in large part to an
ineffective incomes policy could, however, lead to a wage explosion in
1970 that would worsen the U.K's relative price position. Average weekly

IV -18
earnings from wages are rising at an undiminished rate and unit labor
costs appear to be increasing substantially. Recently very large wage
increases have been given in both the public and private sectors. The
Government has nevertheless indicated that it will shortly trim its
powers to control or influence wage and price rises administratively.
The principal bar to a wage explosion and the accelerated
inflation which it would engender is the government's commitment to main-
tain tight monetary and fiscal policies. Present policies are going to
have an exceptionally severe impact on liquidity both of the banks and
in the rest of the economy in the first quarter of 1970, when income tax
payments are concentrated. However, with an election likely to be called
next fall and required by March 1971, present policies may be eased by
budget time next year.
Severe inflationary pressures persist in France although they
are partially bottled up by price controls. Given sizable recent and
prospective wage settlements and accelerated wholesale price increases,
it is doubtful whether the situation will improve appreciably during 1970.
Consumer prices, which rose 6 per cent between the third quarters of 1968
and 1969, have continued to rise since the franc was devalued by 11 per
cent in August. These increases have occurred despite the imposition of
price controls and the delay in application of the Common Market's Common
Agricultural Policy (CAP) rules to domestic food prices. Wholesale
prices for manufactured goods have risen almost 11 per cent over the
year.

IV -19
Prompted by the expectation of further cost and price inflation,
as well as a desire to restore their profit margins, most French exporters
have reduced their foreign currency prices only slightly since the
devaluation, and prices to foreign buyers in general appear to have
declined less then the 5 per cent officially expected.
Upward pressure on prices will probably continue to be substantial
in 1970. Even if the government's stabilization program succeeds in
slowing down the rise of demand, wage increases next year are likely to
be well in excess of productivity gains, although probably considerably
less than the 11 per cent year-to-year rise in 1969.
In Italy, rapidly rising demand pressures on resources and a
sharp increase in labor costs, particularly during the second quarter, have
contributed to a marked acceleration of wholesale and consumer price
increases during 1969. This follows several years of exceptional stability.
Increases in the prices of steel products and non-ferrous metals, reflecting
strength in world markets, have been particularly rapid since the start
of the year.
The labor-cost-push elements of this inflation are expected to
become more intense in 1970. The OECD estimates that hourly earnings for
the economy as a whole may increase 12 per cent over 1969, following a
9 per cent projected increase from 1968 to 1969, and unit labor costs
might consequently rise about 7 per cent, or roughly double the present
rate.

IV -20
Although the institution of a price freeze in the Netherlands
from April to September successfully arrested the highly inflationary pace
of consumer prices which characterized the first quarter of this year,
the Dutch authorities continue to grapple with the problem of dampening
wage demands which could stimulate a new wage-price spiral. Productivity
gains have sharply diminished, so that the expected high wage demands
are likely to contribute to continued inflationary pressures. A 7-1/2 per
cent increase in consumer prices is projected for all of 1969, and before
the German mark revaluation the Dutch Planning Bureau estimated a 3-1/2
to 4 per cent increase in 1970. The revaluation--increasing the prices
of German goods in the Netherlands and raising German demand for Dutch
output with the economy already operating essentially at full capacity--
is expected by the Bureau to add about one percentage point to their
forecast of price increases for 1970.
Wholesale and consumer prices have continued to rise in Belgium
at the more advanced pace in evidence since the autumn of 1968, primarily
because of demand pressures. Although the 7.2 per cent increase in hourly
earnings in mining, manufacturing and transportation in the 12 months
to the third quarter of 1969 was typical of the rate of rise during the
last three years, there is evidence that more rapid wage increases may
be in the offing. These cost pressures,along with the inflationary impact
of the German revaluation,could cause a greater rise in the GNP deflator
during 1970 than the 4 per cent officially forecast.

IV -21
Wholesale and retail prices in Japan rose at sharply accelerated
rates between March and October of this year. Investment-led demand,
financed by expanding bank credit as well as by retained profits and
depreciation funds, has been the primary cause of this inflation. A
tightening of bank credit availability, signaled by the rise in the
discount rate on September 1, should lead to some abatement of the
investment demand and also of the rate of price inflation during the
next 6 months.
The easing of demand pressures in Canada during the second and
third quarters, owing to widespread strikes and restrictive monetary
and fiscal policies, has caused some slowing in the rate of increase in
consumer prices and a leveling off in wholesale prices. The revival of
demand associated with the ending of the strikes, however, and an
acceleration in the rate of increase of labor costs per unit of manufacturing
output may bring a renewed upward trend in prices in the near future.
Unit labor costs increased at an annual rate of 10.6 per cent
in the third quarter, compared to 6.6 per cent and 7.4 per cent in the
first and second quarters, respectively. Although this third-quarter
figure is exaggerated by the sharp drop in manufacturing output resulting
from strikes, increases from wage settlements averaging almost 8 per cent
per annum in the past quarter point to continued large advances in unit
labor costs during the next few quarters.

APPENDIX A: The Trade-Off Between Inflation and Unemployment*
Recent high rates of inflation have led many observers to
question whether we are still confronted by the same order of trade-
off between price inflation and unemployment witnessed earlier in
the post-war period. One school of thought argues that as inflation
accelerates, implicit or explicit cost-of-living escalators are built
more and more into wage bargains and price determinations, with the
result that the rate of inflation tends to accelerate at relatively
low unemployment rates. Even if one does not accept this proposition,
it still may be true that recent inflation has altered the trade-off
between unemployment and inflation--or in technical terms, shifted
the Phillips curve--in ways that will produce a less favorable
relative performance over the next few years.
To test this possibility, we have estimated a simple Phillips
curve relationship for the U.S. economy, using quarterly data over the
1954-1969 period. This relationship could be expressed either in
terms of wages or prices, using any of a variety of indices of labor
or product market tightness. For convenience, this appendix focuses
on an equation which relates the annual percentage rate of increase
of the GNP deflator (AP/P) to the percentage unemployment rate of the
civilian labor force (U), the percentage rate of increase of Federal
wage rates (AF/F) and the percentage rate of increase in farm prices
and world materials prices (AX/X). The variable (AX/X) is assumed to
be given, and to be unaffected by labor market conditions in the U.S.
The unemployment rate used in this equation is in both current and
lagged form to test the possibility of delayed responses of prices,
and it is entered as a reciprocal to give the characteristic curvi-
linear shape of the Phillips curve. The estimated equation is:
aP 35.2340 136.9314 AF-= 3.3329 - + 2 + .0243 --P U 2 F
AX 2
+ .0206 -; = .682, SE = .767, with
all variables at least marginally statistically significant.
The unemployment terms U and U2 included in this equation are
weighted averages of current and past values. The average lag between
unemployment and price change proves to be only about one quarter. The
standard error (SE) and the R2 indicate that two-thirds of the time
(on average) this equation will miss the annual rate of inflation by
less than .8 of one per cent in any given quarter.
* Prepared by Edward M. Gramlich, Economist, Special Studies Section,
Division of Research and Statistics.

-2 -
This equation is graphed in Chart 1, where the long-run
relation between the unemployment rate and the rate of price change
is shown for given (constant) values of Federal pay rates, farm
prices, and world materials prices.1/ The chart indicates that
annual rates of inflation slightly in excess of 3 per cent are
associated with 4 per cent unemployment rates, while the rate of
inflation drops to about 2 per cent with 5 per cent unemployment
rates. There would even be some inflation with unemployment rates
in the 8 to 9 per cent range, according to this equation, although
the validity of this conclusion is questionable because there are
no historical observations in this range in the sample.
This Phillips curve indicates little present possibility
of keeping the unemployment rate below 4 per cent without perpetuating
rather large rates of inflation. Again, however, the points on the
curve below unemployment rates of 3.3 per cent should be questioned
because there were no sample observations in this range. On the
whole, this Phillips curve is steeper than others in the literature
which did not include 1969 in their data sample--suggesting that
prices begin to rise rather rapidly at relatively low rates of
unemployment. But this might also be interpreted to mean that
moderately higher unemployment rates than we have experienced in 1968
and 1969 would ultimately succeed in reducing inflationary pressures
substantially.
Evidence that the unemployment--price inflation trade-off
could be worsening may be gained from an examination of the residuals
of the equation, which are shown in Chart 2. Comparison of the
predicted and actual values indicates that there is no systematic
bias in the equation in any period except 1956-1958. In 1956, which
was the most inflationary year before 1969, the equation does seem
to have gotten out of line, possibly because of a shift in infla-
tionary expectations, and it seems to have stayed out of line
throughout the entire 1958 recession. Thus, the equation under-
predicted inflation in 1956 and went on to underpredict inflation in
the subsequent recession.
There is no firm evidence that a similar tendency is at
work now, but it is instructive to look at the three residuals for
1969. It can be seen that the equation began the year over-predicting
rates of inflation by a small amount, and since then it has been
predicting declining rates of inflation because of the gradually rising
1/ To the extent that these price variables assumed to be constant tend
to increase over time, higher rates of increase in the GNP deflator
would be associated with any given unemployment rate.

unemployment rate (measured on a quarterly average basis). But actual
rates of inflation this year have shown just the reverse pattern,
rising from 4.8 per cent in the first quarter to 5.3 per cent in the
third. Thus, although the equation did not make significant errors
over the first three quarters of 1969, it looks as if it soon may.
Whether the 1956-1958 pattern of greater relative inflation will be
repeated is not yet clear; nor is it possible to assign very
convincing causes to supposed shifts in the curve. Nonetheless, it
is not too early to say that there is some danger that our unemploy-
ment--inflation trade-off may again be in process of becoming more
unfavorable than indicated by the calculated Phillips curve.

APPENDIX B: THE BUDGET OUTLOOK FOR FISCAL 1970*
The budget surplus of $5.9 billion projected by the
Administration in the Summer budget review would now appear to be
unlikely of attainment given recent Congressional action on taxes
and appropriations and assuming the Board staff forecast of budget
receipts for the current fiscal year.
I. Expenditures for fiscal 1970
A review of Congressional action and of recent trends in
outlays suggests that the Administration's current projection of
total budget outlays for fiscal 1970 is at the low end of a reason-
able range- of estimates. Only if furthe- budget cuts beyond those
already announced are undertaken would the Administration's $192.9
billion ceiling still appear to be attainable. A rough estimate of
the size of further budget cuts the Administration may have to make
in order to keep expenditures under its self-imposed ceiling is
indicated in Table I; this table shows the expenditure increases,
above the Administration estimate, that are expected to result from
Congressional action and from other circumstances not easily
controlled by the Administration.
A. Congressional action
As of December 1 Congress had completed action on only
four of the regular appropriations bills, covering roughly 14 per
cent of expenditures for fiscal 1970, and these will have a
negligible effect on outlays planned by the Administration. Never-
theless Congress appears to be headed toward the enactment of

legislation that could add substantial amounts to the fiscal 1970
budget request and could test the Administration's determination to
stick to its self-imposed spending ceiling of $192.9 billion. The
expenditure categories in which fiscal 1970 outlays may exceed
Administration estimates, identified in Table I, are discussed
briefly below.
Of course, a net addition to expenditures is not inevitable.
There is still an opportunity for Congress to make substantial cuts
in appropriations bills not yet passed. Also, the Administration
does not believe that it is obliged to spend all funds appropriated
by Congress. Thus, the $1 billion for education the House recently
tacked on to a continuing resolution" providing stop-gap spending
authority for those agencies whose budget authority is still pending,
will not be spent by the Administration unless this can be done with-
out breaking the $192.9 billion ceiling.

-3 -
The $5.3 billion cut in appropriations for National Defense
recently made by the House is not expected to significantly change
the Administration's planned fiscal 1970 outlays, About $3.0 billion
in fiscal 1970 outlays are affected by the House action, but these
reductions are reported to be the decreases previously announced by
Defense Secretary Laird and included in the Summer Budget Review.
Recent expenditure trends and continuing low levels of contract
awards and other defense indicators appear to be consistent with
the Administration's $77.0 billion target for defense outlays in
the current fiscal year.
(1) Social Security. The largest increase above the
Administration's budget request is expected to be for Social Security.
The Summer Budget Review includes $600-700 million for a 10 per cent
increase in social security benefits that would affect payments in
the last quarter of fiscal 1970. The Board staff's present estimate
includes an additional $300 million on the assumption that the 10 per
cent increase in benefit payments will begin a month earlier.
However, the Senate has recommended a 15 per cent increase
in benefits effective retroactively to January 1, 1970. Similar
legislation has been approved by the House "ways and Means Committee
and there appears to be little opposition in the House. Quick
action on this Social Security measure was ma e possible by the
postponement of action on most of the more controversial supplementary
reform measures contained in the Administration's Social Security
proposal. The 15 per cent increase in Social Security benefits is
tentatively estimated to cost $1.7 billion in fiscal 1970. 1/ Thus,
the Administration's estimate of increased outlays for social
security appears to be understated by at least $1 billion.
(2) Postal rate increase. The Administration and Board
staff estimates of expenditures assume an increase in postal rates
(a negative expenditure) effective January 1, 1970. The proposed rate
increase would have reduced outlays in fiscal 1970 by more than $.3
billion. However, prospects for legislative action and implementation
before July 1, 1970 are now remote.
(3) Veterans assistance. Both the Senate and House have
voted increased appropriations--$.4 and .2 billion, respectively--for
education assistance to Vietnam veterans above the amount requested
by the Administration. The Board staff expenditure estimate includes
$.3 billion for this program.
(4) Other bills passed by House or Senate. A few other
bills have passed in the Senate or House with provisions for fiscal
1970 outlays above the amounts requested by the Administration.
1/ This estimate excludes the increase in minimum benefits passed
by the Senate but not expected to survive Senate-House conference.

-4 -
The net effect of enactment of these bills would be an increase
in outlays of about $.4 billion. 1/ The largest increase is $.5
billion passed by the House for the Labor, Health, Education and
Welfare bill, which is partially offset by reductions in other
categories.
(5) Asset sales. In addition to the expected increases
mentioned above, ther is a possibility that the Administration will
have difficulty in completing certain asset sales that appear as neagtive
outlays in the fiscal 1970 budget. In a recent speech Budget
Director Mayo stated that, if credit conditions do not become easier,
it will be extremely difficult" to sell much of the $4 billion of
loans of the Farmers Home Administration, the Export-Import Bank
and the Veterans Administration that had been planned. 2/
B. Hard to control items
There are two categories of "uncontrollable" expenditures
that seem to be running well ahead of Administration estimates. The
largest is outlays by the Commodity Credit Corporation, which the
staff expects to exceed Administration estimates by about $.7 billion.
Apparently, the Administration's projections of crop yields were
substantially below current staff estimates. The second category
is interest on the debt, which the staff estimates will run about
$.2 billion above budget figures.
II. Receipts.
The Board staff is now projecting fiscal 1970 receipts
about $2.6 billion lower than the Administration's $19 .3 billion
estimate. The staff's estimate is based on lower estimates of
corporate profits. The essential provisions of the Administration's
tax proposals relating to the income tax surcharge, to the investment
tax credit (with a possible exemption mentioned below) and to excise
taxes are expected to be adopted. This legislation involves about
$4.0 billion in fiscal 1970 revenues.
The House has voted to retain the surtax at the 5 per cent
level through June, 1970, as requested by the Administration. Recent
Senate action indicates that it will do the same. Congress also is
expected to repeal the investment tax credit retroactively to April,
1969, as requested by the Administration, with a possible exemption
voted by the Senate that would continue the investment tax credit.on
1/ This excludes a possible Federal pay raise. The House passed a pay
raise estimated to cost more than $.5 billion in fiscal 1970. The
Administration vigorously opposed the House measure. On December 8,
however, the Senate Post Office and Civil Service Committee approved
a drastically:amended version of the House bill, estimated to cost
$.7 billion in fiscal 1970, which may receive Administration approval.
2/ The Budget Bureau identifies $3.2 billion in planned asset sales as
follows: $2.3 billion for the Farmers Home Administration; $.3 billion
for the Export-Import Bank; $.4 billion for the Veterans Administra-
tion; and $.1 billion for the-Department-of Housing and Urban Development.

a firm's first $20,000 of equipment expenditures. The impact of
this exemption is not yet clear but preliminary estimates suggest
that its enactment would not substantially decrease fiscal 1970
revenues. Together these Administration proposals involve more than
$3 billion of receipts in fiscal 1970 as shown in Table II. The
House and Senate Committees also have recommended the extension
of the excise tax ($.5 billion) as requestion by the Administration;
and a protion of the user chrage ($.2 billion), proposed by the
Administration, has been enacted.

However, the tax reform and relief bills being debated in
Congress could affect fiscal 1970 revenues. Committee reports
indicate that reform and relief provisions adopted by the House
would have no net effect on fiscal 1970 revenues, while the bill
adopted by the Senate Finance Committee would result in a net reduc-
tion of $.4 billion. However, Senator Gore's substitute tax relief
proposal, which includes an increase in personal income tax exemptions,
tentatively estimated to cost about $1.7 billion this fiscal year,
was recently adopted by the Senate. If this entire proposal survives
the Senate-House conference, revenue losses in fiscal 1970 may
be more than $1.4 billion, as shown in Table III. However on December
8, the President stated that he would veto a bill that included
both an increase in personal income tax exemption to $800 (contained
in Senator Gore's proposal adopted by the Senate) and a 15 per cent
increase in Social Security benefits. Since there is wide support for

-6 -
the Social Security benefit increase, the entire Gore tax relief
proposal probably will not survive the Senate-House conference.
Other provisions being considered by the Senate could result in
further revenue loss in fiscal 1970 if enacted.

III. Summary.
It now appears that expenditures may be $3.0 billion above
the Administration's $192.9 billion ceiling for fiscal 1970 unless
substantial further budget cuts are made. 1/ On the revenue side the
Board staff's current projection of total receipts is about
$2.6 billion less than the Administration's 198.8 billion estimate
because of a lower staff estimate of corporate profits. Considera-
tion must also be given to the possible reduction in revenues that
may result from pending tax relief and reform legislation. As shown
in Table IV a combination of the revenue and expenditure measures
discussed above could result in a significant reduction in the budget
surplus, if no further budget cuts are made.
1/ The amount could be substantially greater, if asset sales, discussed
above, are not completed.

Summer Budget Review, Sept. 17, 1969.
The staff forecast of receipts differs from the Administration estimate
because the staff projection of corporate profits is lower. The
Administration's expenditure estimate is presumed to be accurate.
Assumes adoption of House Tax reform and relief measures, which have
no net revenue impact, and a $3.0 billion net increase in outlays
not offset by further budget cuts.
Assumes a $1.4 billion revenue loss due to adoption of Senate Com-
mittee tax reform and relief bill as amended by Senator Gore and a $3.0
billion net increase in outlays.
In addition to assumptions indicated in footnote 3 it is further
assumed that the Administration is not able to make $3.0 billion of the
planned asset sales (a negative outlay).1/

APPENDIX C: SURVEY OF BANK LENDING PRACTICES. NOVEMBER 19691_/
About one-third of the respondents in the November 15 Bank
Lending Practices Survey reported stronger demand for business loans
during the preceding three months (Table 1). In the prior survey,
half of the respondents had indicated stronger loan demand in the pre-
ceding three-month period. The balance of the respondents in the
current survey stated that loan demand had remained essentially unchanged.
Moreover, about 85 per cent of the banks expected loan demand to be
unchanged or stronger over the next three months.
In keeping with the continued restrictive credit situation,
many banks further firmed terms and conditions on loans to nonfinancial
businesses (Tables I and 2A). From 50-60 per cent of the respondents
reported higher interest rates and more stringent compensating balance
requirements on such loans. Moreover, about one-third of the respondents
had adopted stricter standards with regard to credit worthiness and
maturity of term loans. Credit lines and loan applications of new
and nonlocal service area customers, of course, continued to come under
increasing scrutiny, with 55-60 per cent of the banks having firmed
lending policies with regard to such customers. And about one-third of
the respondents reported more restrictive lending policies to established
and local service area customers. Factors such as the intended use of
the loan and the potential value of the borrower as a source of deposits
were also being considered more carefully by 40-45 per cent of the banks.
The tight credit situation was also reflected in the terms
and conditions on loans to "noncaptive" finance companies. Almost
half of the respondents indicated greater reluctance to establish new
or enlarge existing credit lines for these borrowers. Moreover, 25-35
per cent of the banks had adopted tighter policies with regard to
compensating balance requirements and about one-fifth had raised
interest rates on finance company loans.
From 30-50 per cent of the respondents also reported that
their willingness to make certain other types of loans had been reduced
during the quarter. About half of the banks stated a greater reluctance
to grant term loans to businesses, and 30-40 per cent were less willing
to make mortgage loans. Approximately one-third of those reporting
were less willing to grant loans to brokers or participation loans to
correspondent banks. Moreover, even the relatively profitable consumer
instalment area felt the pressures of monetary restraint with 25 per
cent of the banks reporting greater reluctance to make this type of loan.

The responses in the current survey generally were similar
among banks in various size groups (Table 2). However, lending
policies of smaller banks (deposits of less than $1 billion) were
somewhat more restrictive than those of larger banks (deposits of $1
billion or greater) on term loans to businesses, on loans to nonlocal
customers, on credit lines to finance companies, and on consumer in-
stalment loans.
