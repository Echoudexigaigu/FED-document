SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK
Outlook for Economic Activity
Weakness in the economy became more pronounced in the fourth
quarter. Expansion in GNP slowed appreciably and real growth was
minimal--apparently less than at any time since the first quarter of
1967. Final demands moderated in most sectors and inventory accumula-
tion may have been smaller than in the preceding quarter. In some in-
dustries, such as autos, cutbacks in production schedules slowed
inventory building, while in others stocks declined because of strikes.
At year-end, a number of key indicators continued to show
weakness. Industrial production apparently declined in December for
the fifth successive month, mainly reflecting continued output adjust-
ments to weakening sales, especially in consumer durable goods in-
dustries; in defense and in some materials-producing industries output
was also being cut back. Employment in manufacturing industries
declined further in December.
Retail sales continue lackluster, as income gains have slowed
and attitudes remain pessimistic concerning rising prices and future job
and income prospects. December sales apparently declined from the re-
duced November level, according to weekly data, and new domestic auto
sales dropped sharply to an annual rate of 7.7 million units.
There is a high probability of further easing in economic
activity in the first half of 1970, especially in view of recent
weakening trends. Some decline in inventory investment seems likely,

I 2
and we have projected a $4 billion lower rate of accumulation in the
second quarter. Limited availability of mortgage funds and high in-
terest rates continue to point to further substantial declines in
housing starts. Financing difficulties can also be expected to slow
State and local government capital expenditures, and by mid-1970,
Federal purchases of goods and services are still projected to be
$4 billion below the fourth quarter level.
Recent legislation reducing taxes and increasing social
security benefits provides more stimulus than we had assumed earlier,
and should serve to increase consumption somewhat. But prospective
additions to disposable income should be moderated in the first half
by downward pressures on output and employment and a further rise in
the saving rate is likely to be associated with the reduction in the
surtax and the bulge in social security benefits.
Higher outlays for business fixed investment remain the
major expansive force in the first half of this year. We continue to
project first half increases in capital spending close to those
reported in the recent Commerce-SEC survey, though there is an in-
creasing likelihood of short-falls as the year progresses. On
balance, real GNP is likely to show no further rise and may actually
decline in the first half of this year.
Outlook for resource use and prices
Pressures on available industrial capacity and manpower have
been abating over recent months, and this trend should continue well
into 1970. The capacity utilization rate in manufacturing is estimated

I 3
to have declined to under 81 per cent in December; without the General
Electric strike, the rate would have been around one-half percentage
point higher. With industrial production projected to decline further
while capacity continues to grow, the rate is expected to dip below
80 per cent in the current quarter and some further downdrift is likely
over the remainder of the year.
Initial and continued claims for unemployment insurance rose
further in December, in part reflecting reductions in output of autos
and other consumer durable goods. Our projections continue to show
little change in nonfarm employment in the first half of this year--
with some decline in manufacturing employment--and a rise in the un-
employment rate to about 4.5 per cent by mid-year.
Nonetheless, upward pressures on wages are intense and
settlements this year will be substantial. The agreement with the
New York City transit workers provides a very large wage increase over
the next two years. In the current quarter, major contracts covering
some 1.5 million workers must be renegotiated and another million
workers are covered by contracts expiring in the second quarter.
Difficulties ahead in settling new labor contracts are pointed up by
the apparent lack of progress in the G.E. negotiations after ten weeks
of strike.
Despite potentially large settlements on new contracts, we
expect some moderation this year in the overall rate of increase in
nonfarm average hourly earnings. This comprehensive measure should

I -4
reflect the easing in demands for labor and shorter workweeks with less
overtime pay.
While we continue to expect some slowing of price inflation,
we have again raised our projection of the GNP deflator for 1970.
Partly this reflects the effect on materials prices of the continued
boom in Western Europe and Japan, and the less favorable outlook for
food prices as a result of a larger and more extended shortfall. in
pork supplies than had been anticipated. In addition, prospective
further increases in unit labor costs and management efforts to
minimize declines in profits through pricing policies will keep
upward pressures on industrial commodity prices. But relatively weak
over-alldemands and growing manpower and industrial resources still
seem likely to dampen the over-all rate of price advance.
Prospective financial developments
A major factor in the near-term financial outlook is the very
large volume of security offerings now in prospect for early 1970.
As this expanded supply of new issues is marketed, interest rates may
come under renewed upward pressure at least temporarily. Over the
somewhat longer run, the principal influence that would tend to
moderate interest rate pressures would be a further slowing of economic
activity. Any overt action lessening the intensity of monetary
restraint would,of course, accelerate such rate declines.
Outlook for securities markets. Expansion in the prospective
supply of securities is centered chiefly in markets for publicly offered

I -5
corporate bonds and Federal agency obligations. Nearly $1.5 billion of
corporate bonds are already scheduled for January offering. In the
absence of postponements, this supply could easily become still larger
by month end, and volume for succeeding months of the quarter also
seems likely to be sizable.
In the market for Federal agency obligations, the Home Loan
Bank System can be expected to seek as much new money as the market
will bear during the first quarter, given the heavy volume of already
outstanding FHLB notes that must be refinanced. Altogether this net
cash need may run to $1.3 billion of new money, and near the end of
January the Farmer's Home Administration will be marketing $350-400
million of 5- and 10-year loan notes through an underwriting syndicate.
If this latter operation is successful and the Budget goal on asset
sales is to be even approximately realized, sizable further offerings of
loan notes will be needed by early spring. With respect to State and
local governmental units, financial needs will also remain pressing,
although interest rate ceilings and constraints on commercial bank
purchases should continue to restrict the average monthly volume of
new offerings to less than $1 billion.
Even if heavy savings attrition at the S&L's should force the
Home Loan Bank System to draw temporarily on its direct borrowing line
at the Treasury, the Treasury is not expected to enter the market for
new money until late February or early March. However, the February
Treasury refinancing will be an additional factor exerting pressure on

I -6
securities markets during January and early February, and this pressure
will be intensified if the 2-1/2 per cent bond that matures in March
is refunded along with the maturing February note, as seems likely.
Taken together, public holdings of these two issues total $5.6 billion.
Announcement of terms on the refinancing is scheduled for the last
week in January, with books open early in February.
Outlook for mortgage lending. Fragmentary evidence available
for the initial days of the current reinvestment period at depositary
institutions suggest that savings attrition, while not of the disastrous
proportions some had feared, is nevertheless likely to be large. Since
heavy attrition had been widely anticipated, nonbank thrift institutions
have already been following a policy of substantially reduced mortgage
lending. The supply of mortgage money should thus remain light in the
period ahead and mortgage interest rates should rise further, although
the recent increase in ceiling rates on FHA and VA mortgages will tend
to facilitate renewed activity in these Federally underwritten in-
struments.
Outlook for commercial banks. The heavy volume of capital
market borrowing scheduled by corporations for early 1970 may permit
some loan repayment at banks, and the projected cutback in business
inventory investment may also help to reduce business loan growth.
Overall, however, business demands for funds seem likely to remain
strong enough to maintain heavy pressures on the banking system--
particularly if the interest costs of commercial paper financing continue

I -7
above the prime rate on loans at banks. Also, with the volume of
offerings in securities markets expanding, security loans at banks
could very well rise again.
The initial evidence on January deposit experience at banks
suggests that attrition in consumer-type time and savings accounts will
be heavy during the post-interest crediting period, as expected.
While the rate of attrition is likely to moderate substantially as the
quarter progresses, there appears to be little prospect for significant
renewed growth in such accounts in the absence of a change in prevailing
money market conditions or Regulation Q rate ceilings. Further
declines in large domestic CD's are also expected but at a reduced
rate commensurate with the shrinking level of outstandings, and inflows
of foreign official deposits probably will continue to provide some
offset to these losses. Taking all prospective sources of bank funds
together, the outlook seems to be for little change from the recent
conditions of persistent restraint, with little growth on balance
or even some decline in both bank credit and the money supply, barring
a change in monetary policy.

I-8
Balance of payments outlook
U.S. foreign trade statistics for November again failed to
demonstrate as much slowing in the trend of U.S. import demand as we
have been expecting. On the export side, too, the November outcome
was a little disappointing, especially as regards machinery shipments--
for which new export orders have continued strong. Probably the
maintenance of strong U.S. demand for business capital equipment and
tight supply conditions in this market contributed to the November
trade results. The same factors may continue to act as a drag on
improvement of the U.S. balance of payments on current account in
coming months, and may perhaps call for some revision of our net
export projection.
For the over-all balance of payments, prospects for 1970 are
still for a net outflow of capital--apart from U.S. banks' borrowings
abroad--much exceeding the expected small surplus on goods and
services. The end-of-1969 gyrations in flows of U.S. corporate and
other nonbank funds and the associated over-all surpluses on both
bases of computation for December were occasioned partly by year-end
requirements of the OFDI controls and partly by the continuing
seepage of money out of the German mark; the first of these factors
was strictly temporary and the second will now be of diminishing
importance.
Efforts of U.S. banks to attract funds out of other currencies
into Euro-dollars may be expected to be less successful in the next few
months than at the same time of year in 1969, when interest rates in

some European national markets were considerably lower than now and
when holders of sterling and French francs were ,less confident about
staying in those currencies. Although U.S. money market rates,
and with them Euro-dollar rates, are much higher now than a year
ago, the willingness of U.S. banks to bid up Euro-dollar rates
still further is now somewhat restrained by the cost of the 10 per
cent marginal reserve requirement on their borrowings from branches.

THE ECONOMIC PICTURE IN DETAIL
Domestic Nonfinancial Scene
Gross national product. The year ended with further indications
of weakness in most major sectors of demand. Consumer purchases con-
tinued sluggish through December--with a sharp decline in auto sales--
and further reductions were also evident in new residential construction
and in defense expenditures. The weakness in these areas of final sales
was apparently reflected in some unintended accumulation of stocks,
further downward adjustments of output, particularly in consumer goods
industries, and reduced pressure on resources. Industrial production
in December is expected to show a decline for the fifth month in a row;
manufacturing capacity use was reduced further; factory employment
declined and personal income gains slowed appreciably. Nevertheless,
cost and price pressures still remain strong, and the latest evidence
of capital spending intentions--a December Commerce-SEC survey of plans
for the year 1970--indicates that businessmen still intend to increase
their spending, particularly in the first half of this year.
We are now estimating that GNP increased by about $11 billion
in the fourth quarter, and in real terms growth of gross national
product slowed almost to a halt. Sluggish retail sales figures re-
flected both the recent slowing in income gains and a continued dis-
inclination on the part of consumers to spend, particularly for such
items as automobiles and appliances. As a result, the saving rate

II -2
probably remained close to the relatively high third quarter rate.
Unit sales of new domestic cars edged down throughout the fourth
quarter; in December the annual rate of sales, at 7.7 million units,
was about 10 per cent below a year earlier. Although there may have
been a last minute flurry of pre-Christmas buying, weekly figures in-
dicate that sales for the month declined, following a drop in November.
In real terms, retail sales have now been below year-earlier levels
for over half a year.
Residential construction activity also continued weak. Housing
starts declined in November and for the quarter as a whole are estimated
to have dropped to 1.3 million rate. Residential construction expendi-
tures held at about the third quarter level, but only because of an
increase in expenditures for alterations and additions. More significant,
however, was the sizable decline in October and November of multi-
family housing starts, which previously had appeared to be less
affected by tight financial markets than single family units.
State and local governments also continued to be adversely
affected by the high cost and limited availability of funds. Purchases
of goods and services by this sector this past quarter continued the
sluggish pattern of gains in outlays evident since mid-year. Federal
purchases were held in check by a further cut in defense outlays. Even
business expenditures for new plant and equipment rose by somewhat less
than in the third quarter. As a result, growth of final sales was down
for the third quarter in a row--to about a $13 billion increase,

II -3
compared with a rise of $20 billion in the first quarter. Although
inventory accumulation was more rapid in some sectors, reduced pro-
duction levels and the G.E. strike operated to cut the rate of accumula-
tion late in the year; for the quarter as a whole, inventory accumulation
was estimated to be $2 billion less than in the previous period.
It still appears likely that overall demand will continue to
ease further in the first half of this year and that real GNP may
decline somewhat. Reported plans for continued expansion of capital
spending and the passage of the tax reform measure provide elements
of potential strength, but these factors do not appear sufficient to
offset the probable weakness in other areas. Current monetary re-
straint is expected to reduce construction activity further and to
hold down growth of State and local expenditures. Total Federal
purchases are projected to decline by $4 billion annual rate between
the fourth quarter of 1969 and the second quarter of 1970.
A large part of the increase in business spending indicated
by the Commerce-SEC survey is projected for nonmanufacturing sectors--
mainly public utilities, communications and airlines--where expanding
demand continues to press available capacity. The increase being
planned by manufacturers in the first half of this year is relatively
small. Moreover, some manufacturers are already planning to reduce
expenditures this year, and it is probable that investment plans of
others may be adjusted down in response to short-falls in anticipated
sales, declining profits and the continued scarcity and high cost of

II -4
external funds. We are, therefore, holding close to our former
projection of an increase in capital spending of about 8 per cent
for the year 1970, as compared to the rise of about 10 per cent
reported by the recent Commerce-SEC annual survey.
With respect to the new tax measure, our projections had
already incorporated the estimated impact on disposable income and
consumption of the surcharge reduction effective January 1, and we had
assumed a 10 per cent increase in Social Security benefits effective
April 1. The major impact of the new law occurs in the second quarter
when a 15 per cent increase in Social Security benefits, with retro-
active payments to January 1, adds about $7 billion to disposable
income--about $4 billion more than we had formerly estimated. A
large part of this addition to income is likely to be reflected in
higher consumption, given the limited income of most of the social
security recipients. But with other demands generally easing, growth
of employment is likely to be small at best and the workweek to be
curtailed, dampening increases in wage and salary income. Consumer
attitudes toward spending have seriously deteriorated in recent months
and a relatively high saving rate seems likely to be maintained. As
a result, the overall rise in consumer expenditures is still expected
to be relatively moderate in the second quarter, and total final sales
are projected to grow rather slowly. With additional cuts in production
likely to slow the rate of inventory investment, we are projecting

II 5
increases in current dollar GNP of only $8-9 billion in the first and
second quarters.
Although cost factors are likely to continue strong in the
next few quarters, easing demands should be reflected in growing
reluctance of markets to accept price increases. But prices have
continued to rise at a faster rate than we had earlier thought, and
the 3.7 per cent annual rate of increase in the GNP deflator in the
second quarter is somewhat more than we had projected in the last
Greenbook.
Some rebound in the rate of growth of GNP continues to appear
probable in the second half. A moderate easing of monetary restraint--
which we continue to assume will commence by early spring--should halt
the decline in residential construction activity and encourage appreci-
able recovery before year-end. In addition, consumer demand is likely
to respond to the combined impact of the midyear elimination of the
surcharge and increase in personal income tax exemptions, an expected
July 1 Federal pay raise of about 6 per cent, and the lagged effects
of the increase in Social Security benefits paid in the previous
quarter. Given the better market prospects, output seems likely to
recover and inventory investment to stabilize. But resumed growth
in real GNP is not initially anticipated to be at a rate that will
press on available resources, so that some easing of price increases
seems probable in the second half of 1970, even though wage rates
may continue to exceed productivity gains.

Industrial production. Industrial production is estimated to
have declined somewhat further in December--probably by more than one-
half index point to 170.5 per cent. While the decline is though to
be mainly in consumer goods, cutbacks in output of some materials are
also anticipated.
With retail sales sluggish and stocks high, output of television
sets, radios, some appliances, and autos were reduced further in December.
Auto assemblies dropped 8 per cent to an annual rate of 7.3 million
units, as compared to an 8.5 million rate in the first 3 quarters of
1969. Production schedules for the first quarter of 1970 are now set
at the reduced December level. Output of business equipment appears
to have changed little from the strike-depressed November level.
Production of trucks was maintained at record rates, but trade reports
indicate cutbacks in farm machinery.
Output of raw steel changed little in December but production
of materials and parts for the automotive industry--steel, metal
stampings, glass, rubber and textile products, etc.--as well as con-
struction materials are estimated to have been reduced further.
The decline in output of consumer durable goods in 1969 has
been much larger than for materials, as shown in the table, and by
the end of the year production curtailments of consumer goods may have
about reached their low point. However, at these levels of output,
materials consumption has been reduced sharply. Hence, in the first
quarter of 1970 we anticipate further declines in materials production

II -9
and little change in output of consumer goods and business equipment,
except on settlement of the G.E. strike. If these expectations are
realized, the total index would continue to decline at an annual rate
of about 4 per cent, similar to that in the last five months of 1969,
in both time intervals abstracting from the effects of the G.E. strike.

Retail sales. Figures for the first four weeks of December
suggest that sales last month declined about 1 per cent from November.
In real terms, sales were below year-earlier levels for the seventh month
in a row. (The "advance" estimate of November sales has been revised upII

II -10
and a decline of only 1/4 per cent is now shown from the October peak
rather than the originally reported drop of nearly 1 per cent.)
In December, sales declines apparently occurred at food
stores, eating and drinking places, general merchandise stores (in-
cluding department stores), and at automotive outlets. Dealers sales
of new domestic cars were down in December to an annual rate of
7.7 million units, as compared with 8.3 million in November, and were
a tenth below a year earlier. Sales at apparel stores, however, were
up considerably following the large November decline.
For the fourth quarter as a whole, retail sales are now
estimated to have barely exceeded the second quarter level. Sales
at nondurable goods stores have increased moderately in each quarter
this year, but sales at durable goods stores declined in the second
half and were below year-earlier levels.

outstanding increased by $7.4 billion, seasonally adjusted annual rate.
Except for August, this was the smallest monthly rise in outstandings
since January 1968. Growth in auto credit fell sharply after two
months of sizable increases, but this drop was partly offset by a
rebound in credit for other consumer goods. Personal loans continued
to expand about as much as in other recent months.
The slower growth in instalment credit since the second
quarter, when it was increasing at a $9.6 billion annual rate, has
resulted from a moderate decline in extensions and a further rise in
loan repayments. Extensions of credit for autos and other consumer
goods have tended to fluctuate with changes in retail sales of durable
goods; extensions of personal loans--which are more generally associated
with expenditures for services but which may also be made for purchases
of goods--have continuedto rise but at a somewhat slower rate than
earlier.

Cyclical indicators. In November, the Census composite
leading indicator declined 0.6 per cent. But the October composite
was revised upward and the preliminary November figure is only 0.7 per
cent below September. The coincident and lagging indicators rose;
the coincident composite continues less strong, however, than the
lagging composite.

Contributing to the drop in the leaders were an increase in
initial unemployment claims and declines in durable goods new orders,
plant and equipment contracts and orders (almost all of which was in
the construction component), housing permits, and the ratio of price
to unit labor cost. The common stock price average was up in November
and the workweek and the materials price index were unchanged. In
December, the preliminary materials price index was up while the
common stock price average was down.
Inventories. The increase in the book value of manufacturers'
inventories slowed in November; durable manufacturers' stocks grew at
a slower rate, while nondurable manufacturers reported a slight decline.

II -13
Wholesale book values increased much less than the upward-revised
October rate. Figures for retail trade are not yet in, but some
decline from the high October rate of build-up atautomotive dealers
is likely in November and December.

As in October, the build-up in durable goods stocks at
manufacturers was mainly in finished and in-process goods. Inventory
growth slowed in the electrical machinery industry, reflecting the
G.E. strike, and at transportation equipment manufacturers. Accumula-
tion at nonelectrical machinery plants continued at the October rate,
and there was an increase in the rate of growth of inventories of
construction materials.
Among nondurable goods manufacturers, book value inventory
declines were reported at food, textile, rubber and miscellaneous

II -14
industries, largely offset by increases in paper, chemical, and
petroleum.
Although accumulation slowed at durable goods factories,
their inventory-shipments ratio rose; it was above late 1966 levels,
but no higher than in May 1969. And their inventory-backlog ratio
continued to climb.

Orders and shipments. New orders for durable manufactured
goods dropped 2.2 per cent in November, according to the preliminary
report. It was the second decline after September's unexpected sub-
stantial increase, but was smaller than the decline indicated in the
advance report. Durable goods shipments also declined and the order
backlog increased slightly, so that the ratio of unfilled orders to
shipments rose. Nondurable goods orders and shipments continued to
rise.

The November decline in durable goods orders was largely in consu-
mer areas. Moreover, a half billion dollar drop in primary metals orders
was probably associated, at least in part, with cuts in production anti-
cipated for autos and other consumer durables.
Orders in the aircraft industry increased by $700 million,
reflecting a $300 million increase in defense orders and, apparently,
strength in civilian aircraft orders as well. The increase in defense
orders was the second in a row and brought the series back to early
spring levels after a midyear decline. "Equipment less defense"
orders, which includes commercial aircraft and may be a better in-
dicator of capital goods demand than the machinery and equipment
series, increased in November.

II -16
Construction and real estate. Seasonally adjusted new
construction put in place changed little in December at an annual rate
of $91.8 billion. While the rate was only slightly below the record
high reached in September, as in other recent months, all of the year-
to-year increase was due to higher costs as measured by the Census
Bureau.
Private residential construction activity dipped again in
December as a 3 per cent further decline in outlays for new dwelling
units more than offset increased outlays for additions and alterations
and for hotel and other nonhousekeeping units, which together account
for about a fourth of the private residential total. Outlays for
private nonresidential structures changed little in December, at a
rate substantially above a year earlier but appreciably under the
last September peak.
Public construction expenditures edged higher, but this
reflected entirely an advance for the relatively small Federally-owned
sector, which continued below its year-earlier level.

Private housing starts, which were revised upward in October,
dropped further in November to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
1.29 million units as multi-family units fell to a rate sharply below
earlier advanced levels. Regionally, starts showed a month-to-month
advance only in the South.

Major downward pressures in recent months have been particularly
pronounced for multi-family units, which have benefited much less than
single family units from the unprecendented support made available by
the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan
Banks. Based on this support to a single family activity and other
factors, indications are that total housing starts in December may have
held fairly near the November rate, for a fourth quarter average some-
what above the 1.3 million unit level. Even so, this would be nearly a
tenth below the already reduced average for the third quarter and would
imply a total for 1969 as a whole of about 1.49 million, close to the
1.51 million total for 1968 when vacancy rates were already quite low
and the trend of starts was upward.
If allowance is made for the sharp further expansion in mobile
home shipments (which are not included in housing starts or reflected
in residential construction expenditures), the combined total of new
residential units available for purchase may have reached 1.88 million.
This would still be appreciably short of actual requirements. However,
in 1968, when mobile home shipments totaled 320,000, the comparable
total was 1.83 million units. In 1966, it was no more than 1.4 million.
Plant and equipment spending. A special Commerce-SEC survey
of business plans for plant and equipment expenditures, conducted in
December, indicates a total of $78.1 billion for the year 1970, up
9.7 per cent from 1969. This annual figure along with expenditures

II -19
planned for the first two quarters of this year as indicated by the
October-November survey, would imply outlays in the second half of
1970 only about 1.5 per cent higher than in the first half. The
outlook for some further decline in final demands appears to support the
likelihood of a leveling off of business fixed investment next fall.
A much larger rise in investment spending is presently planned
by nonmanufacturing industries as a group than by manufacturing. Public
utilities and the communications and commercial category each report
plans to spend 15 per cent more than in 1969, but nonrail transportation
and mining companies are planning to cut their spending. In manufactur-
ing, an increase of 6.4 per cent is planned for 1970--with above
average increases reported by petroleum, electrical and nonelectrical
machinery, and chemical companies. Spending declines are planned by
rubber, textile, auto, and other transportation equipment firms.

Labor market. Layoffs of factory workers have risen in recent
months, and in November separations exceeded hirings by a significant
margin, suggesting a further decline in manufacturing employment in
December. In addition, joblessness covered under State unemployment
insurance programs continued to rise sharply in December. The number
of workers drawing unemployment pay in mid-December was up 16 per cent
from a year earlier and equal to its highest level (seasonally adjusted)

II -21
since early 1967. To some extent, the higher December levels may reflect
the effects of the G.E. strike; supplier firms have been forced to layoff
some workers and in New York, which permits strikers to draw unemployment
pay after seven weeks on strike, some G.E. strikers are now drawing un-
employment insurance checks.

The recent rise of insured unemployment--which began from a
very low level--has been more rapid than during the 1966-67 slowdown.
If increases persist at the recent pace, the level of insured unemploy-
ment would rise early this year above 1.35 million (seasonally adjusted)
the peak during the 1966-67 slowdown.
Income and employment. Personal income rose $3.2 billion
in November, close to the increases of September and October but well
below the average monthly rise from January through August. The slow-
down of recent months has been concentrated in wages and salaries,
reflecting slower growth of employment and a reduction of working hours.
In November, manufacturing payrolls declined, mainly because
of the G.E. strike, but a strong pick-up was reported in nonmanufacturing

II -22
payrolls. The over-all increase in wages and salaries was about the
same as the relatively small October amount. Most non-wage income
components recorded small advances in November and continued to add
about $1 billion to the increase in personal income.

Industrial relations. At least 5 million workers will be
affected by major collective bargaining negotiations in 1970, a larger
number than in any year of the 1960's and over 2 million more than in
1969. Prospects for extremely difficult collective bargaining this
year have been underscored in recent weeks by workers' rejection of
the proposed railroad shopcraft settlement, the absence of progress
in the G.E. negotiations, and the costly settlement won by the New York
City transit workers.

II -23
The New York transit workers contract provides an immediate
8 per cent wage increase, with a 10 per cent boost on July 1, 1971.
Fringe benefit improvements include a provision that pension fund
contributions now paid by the workers (estimated to equal about 6 per
cent of the average wage) will be borne by the city beginning July 1,
1970.
The proposed railroad agreement--which rail executives had
hoped would set the pattern for this year's bargaining with 450,000
workers--was voted down by the shopcraft unions and must now be re-
negotiated.
Consumer prices. The consumer price index rose at an annual
rate of 6 per cent in November, compared with 4.8 per cent in October,
and was 5.8 per cent above a year ago. Food accounted for a third of
the increase, due to a very sharp temporary rise in fresh vegetables,
sharply increasing egg prices, and a less-than-seasonal drop in pork prices.
Another third of the increase was due to housing costs,
particularly homeownership, including home purchase and services such
as mortgage interest, property taxes, insurance, and residential gas
rates. Apparel, health, and recreation contributed the final third of
the rise of the CPI. This latest large rise in apparel prices con-
tinued the sharp increases begun this fall which have brought the level
to more than 5 per cent above a year ago.

II -24
Prices of durable goods rose less than seasonally in November
even though new car prices continued to increase. Only 1970 models
were priced in November, whereas some 1969 cars were included in the
October sample.

November and over other selected periods are shown below:

Wholesale prices. (Confidential until released Thursday)
Both the total wholesale price index and average prices of industrial
commodities increased at an annual rate of about 4 per cent from mid-
November to mid-December. Farm products and processed foods and feeds
advanced at an annual rate of 7 per cent.
Few signs of slowing inflation can be observed as yet, as
may be seen in the table, price increases in December and also over
the quarter were larger than over the preceding quarter. Prices of
metals, machinery, and many other products are showing steep increases,
and the outlook for food prices has worsened since last month.
Lumber and plywood prices, however--which fell in December after
rising in November--appear to be stable or declining.

The increase in machinery and equipment prices this fall--
September to December--was twice as fast as the rise a year earlier.

II -26
Metals were the largest factor in the overall increase in industrial
commodity prices in December; non-ferrous metals rose at an annual
rate of 30 per cent. Since the mid-December pricing date, the rise
in prices of non-ferrous metals has continued with an increase posted
for lead--the seventh in 1969--and a large rise in copper announced
by some producers. A large part of the explanation for continued
strength in prices of metals lies in heightened foreign demands and
apparently low inventories of many metals.
Since mid-December, price increases have also been announced
for a number of steel products--stainless, specialty, reinforcing bars,
railroad track accessories, and scrap. However, a new billing system
this month will lower prices of major flat-rolled steel products.
Large steel shipments are therefore expected this month especially
as charges for extras will be added February 1.
Prices of foods rose further in December. Although the
November bulge in fresh vegetable prices was reversed, eggs continued
to rise to the highest levels since 1953. Prices of livestock and
meat, which had declined in November, were higheragain on the December
pricing date, reflecting a substantial short-fall on pork supplies.
The Department of Agriculture has recently reported that the spring
pig crop will also be small and meat prices are expected to remain
under pressure.

II -27
Farm real estate values. The rise in land values slowed
to 4 per cent in the year ending November 1, 1969 from 6 per cent in
each of the two preceding years and a rate of 8 per cent during the
world-food-crisis year, 1965-66. For the first time in the decade
values rose less than the GNP deflator, a disappointing performance
for those holding farm real estate as a hedge against inflation. The
number of sales was down about 2 per cent from 1968.
Regional trends were mixed with the most pronounced slackening
occurring in the Western states and the vast livestock and grain pro-
ducing central regions where market values are determined largely by
demand for agricultural uses. In the Northeast, advances in values
larger than the national average probably reflected improved returns
from dairying and the strong current and anticipated demand for land
for nonfarm uses. In the Southeast and the Delta, advancing values
reflected impetus of new farming techniques and industrial expansion
which affected values indirectly.
With the first hand observations of reporters in the
November 1 survey yet to be collated, one can only hypothesize about
the underlying causes of the slowing rise in market values in the
principal agricultural areas. Apprehension about the farm programs
replacing the ones expiring with the 1970 crop year may be a depressing
factor since farmers are aware that large segments of the general
public are extremely critical of price supports and acreage diversion

II -28
payments which are the key provisions of the feed grain and wheat
programs. Also,with 80 per cent of land transfers credit financed,
the credit stringency cited by reporters in the March 1 survey as
the major factor undoubtedly continues to be the most potent force
in the farm real estate market.

THE ECONOMIC PICTURE IN DETAIL
Bank credit. Bank credit is estimated to have declined
$2.6 billion, on a seasonally adjusted basis, in December. This
reduction was nearly as large as the increase recorded in November.
At year-end, bank credit was slightly below its midyear level and
about 1.8 per cent above its year-earlier level.
More than four-fifths of the December decline was accounted
for by a drop in holdings of U.S. Government securities; holdings of
other securities showed little net change over the month, following
their substantial increase in November. A sharp decline in security
loans, which reversed most of the build-up that had taken place in
the two previous months, more than accounted for the rest of the
drop in total bank credit; all other loans taken together continued
to rise at the moderate pace of other recent months and total bank loans
showed their first monthly reduction since March of this year.
The decline in holdings of U.S. Treasury securities included
decreases in all maturity categories. The sale by banks of the tax
bills acquired in the Treasury's late November financing partly
explains the decline in shorter-dated Treasury issues. In addition,
a tax anticipation bill matured in December and a 2-1/2 per cent
bond was redeemed on December 15. Some banks also are reported to
have sold heavily discounted longer-term issues in order to charge
capital losses against favorable current revenues, thereby reducing
1969 tax liabilities.

Business loans at banks increased at a faster pace than the
average experience in the second half of the year. The step-up was
mainly accounted for by buying back loans previously placed with
affiliates in order to build up their year-end loan base for the
calculation of bad debt reserves. Adjusting for this development,
business loans rose at only a 4.5 per cent rate in the month, which
is considerably less than the corresponding adjusted figures for
previous months. On the other hand, there is some indication that
the recent tax legislation has resulted in a change in the December
seasonal pattern. The tax benefits that crude petroleum and other
extractive industries previously derived from carve-out loans were
eliminated and as a result the usual loan expansion at year-end from
this source did not materialize. If a rough correction were made in
the seasonal adjustment factors, December business loan developments,
including adjustment for net loan sales to affiliates, might appear
about as strong as the average of recent months.
Some pickup in seasonally adjusted business loan growth had
been expected for December in view of the large corporate tax pay-
ments scheduled for the middle of the month in face of the generally
diminished state of corporate liquidity. This factor does appear to
have had some impact on the rate of business borrowing that did occur.
The increase in business loans was concentrated in machinery and trans-
portation equipment manufacturers, public utilities, and holdings of
acceptances.

III -4
Bank sources of funds. Total commercial bank deposits
declined moderately in December on a seasonally adjusted basis as a
comparatively large advance in time deposits--the first monthly
advance since last December--was more than counterbalanced by declines
in private demand deposits and U.S. Treasury deposits. In contrast
with earlier experience, nondeposit sources of funds provided no offset
to these deposit outflows. Oustanding commercial paper rose
moderately through December 24 but this was slightly offset by a con-
traction in borrowing in the Euro-dollar market. The decline in
Euro-dollar borrowing is usual for December, since foreign holders
withdraw funds from this market for seasonal and window-dressing
reasons.
Large banks in New York and Chicago continued to be successful
in attracting foreign official funds in December and as a result
the large CD situation at these banks remained much improved. Large
banks outside these two money centers also experienced a slight
abatement in the rate of decline in their large CD's. The picture with
regard to consumer-type time and savings deposits at large banks was
somewhat different, however, as the rate of outflow in December,
when rough allowance is made for seasonal patterns, was essentially
unchanged from the comparatively strong pace set in other recent
months. At country member banks, the time deposit picture appeared to
be slightly improved in December as compared to recent months although
continuing quite weak compared to previous years.

III -5a
Money supply. After dropping sharply over most of December,
the money supply increased substantially in the final week of the
month. This turnaround at month-end possibly reflected temporary
repatriation of corporation funds held abroad and shifts of funds
from time deposit accounts in preparation for making market invest-
ments. For the month as a whole, the money supply declined at a
3.0 per cent annual rate. This brought the figure for the fourth
quarter to a slight over-alldecline comparable to that for the third
quarter. In contrast,over the first half of the year the money stock
increased at a 4.3 per cent annual rate. For the year as a whole,
the money supply grew at about a 2 per cent rate as compared to 7.2
per cent in 1968.

III -6
Nonbank depositary intermediaries. Preliminary information
suggests that deposit outflows from both mutual savings banks and
savings and loan associations during the three-day end of December
grace period were not substantially different from those a year earlier.
In fact, San Francisco District savings and loans experienced a smaller
grace-period outflow this year than last year, although these associa-
tions have been experiencing steady deposit drains for the past several
months.

of December, after adjustment for the seasonally heavy crediting of
dividends and interest, savings and loan associations' deposits actually
declined slightly, at a seasonally adjusted annual attrition rate of
nearly one per cent. For the second half of 1969, savings and loan
association deposit growth slowed markedly to a one per cent seasonally
adjusted annual rate, in contrast to the nearly 5 per cent growth rate
experienced during the first half of the year.

It is difficult to interpret this unusual deposit flow
pattern. The early December pattern may reflect the widespread growth
in the usage of daily interest crediting on passbook accounts, which
minimizes the pressure to withdraw at end of quarters. It is quite
unlikely that the recently-announced "Housing Certificate of Deposit"
authorized by the FHLBB has helped stem grace period outflows./ More-
over, patterns during the past few reinvestment periods have suggested
that the large outflows have occurred in theearly part of the month
following interest crediting. Thus, information on withdrawals during
early January--which may be available in time for the FOMC meeting--
will provide a key measure of the ability of these institutions to
retain funds.
There is no indication that the intermediaries have been
taken unprepared by developments so far. Savings and loan advances
from the FHLB System during December were not out of line with their
pattern of the past several months, being about double the year-ago
increase. Consequently, the net liquidity position of the FHLB Banks
as of the end of December stood at $1.2 billion, which while a decline
from the $1.4 billion held a month earlier, was in line with other
recent months. If there is a marked deterioration in S&L deposit flows,
the FHLB System could rely on the $1 billion (of the $4 billion
authorized) available from the Treasury. The FHLB System does have a

$500 million refinancing due in late January at which time--in any
event--there will most likely be need to raise substantial additional
new money.
In response to low deposit growth since earlier in the year
as well as to widespread pessimism regarding the outlook for savings
flows during the year-end interest-crediting period, both savings banks
and savings and loan associations had been following cautious policies
with regard to their mortgage commitment positions. This trend con-
tinued during November, when new mortgage commitments made by both of
these institutions declined by more than 17 per cent after seasonal
adjustment, and their backlog of outstanding commitments had been
worked down to 11 per cent below that of a year ago. Gross mortgage
investment has already begun to abate. For example, S&L's closed a
sharply reduced volume of new mortgages during November, and at the
same time, their mortgage repayments reached a three-year low after
having been maintained at a very stable dollar volume. The impact of
these reduced mortgage repayments, which probably reflect the slowdown
of mortgage closings and the ever-increasing use of mortgage assump-
tions, will most likely fall primarily on S&L earnings, as the rate
has been slowed at which older lower-rate mortgages are removed from
portfolios.

Mortgage market.
underwritten mortgages wereFaced with the fact that Government-
no longer attractive either from the
borrower or the investor viewpoint, due primarily to the deep discounts,
the Secretary of HUD raised the ceiling rate on FHA and VA mortgages to
8-1/2 per cent, effective January 5. The change in the ceiling was the
first since January 1969 and the one per cent increase was the largest
in the history of FHA. Although the new 8-1/2 per cent ceiling is
higher than the usury ceilings in 21 states and the District of Columbia,
all but 7 of these jurisdictions exempt Government-underwritten loans
from the state usury laws./
1/ The jurisdictions in which lenders will be unable to take full
advantage of the new rate are Indiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Ohio,
South Dakota, Virginia, and the District of Columbia.

III -11
The change in the ceiling was dictated by the need to permit
prospective borrowers to compete for available funds, and to ease the
discount burden normally borne by sellers of existing homes and builders
of new homes. However, the higher ceiling will also raise the effective
level of monthly debt service payments, thereby forcing some households
to accept a somewhat smaller loan and/or provide larger downpayments.
Total out-of-pocket monthly outlays for all homeownership costs on
homes purchased with Government-underwritten loans would rise by about
5 per cent.
In December, the implicit private market yield on FNMA
6-month forward purchase commitments continued to rise. The FNMA yield
was bid up in anticipation of the increase in the FHA and VA rate
ceiling by bidders who could no longer originate loans at the required
discounts. Under the rules of the FNMA auction, bidders will be allowed
to deliver the new 8-1/2 per cent mortgages against their outstanding
commitments with FNMA adjusting the price upward to receive the same
yield as specified by the original bid, which was based on the 7-1/2
per cent rate ceiling. This implies that successful bidders will now
be able to deliver the new 8-1/2's at prices near par under the FNMA
commitments received in December. In the January 5 auction, the first
based on the 8-1/2 per cent ceiling, the volume of bids received
increased substantially as the outlook for originations became brighter.
With the auction limits set even lower than in the previous week--based
on FNMA's lagged response to auction developments--yields rose quite
sharply. As a result, discounts, which had reached nearly 10 points in

III -12
prior auctions, still averaged 4.5 points based on the new ceiling
rate. However, the action taken by HUD and its impact on FNMA auction
bidding should help to assure the continued strong support by FNMA of
the Government-underwritten mortgage market.

During November, the average contract rate on conventional

secondary market for FHA-insured home mortgages was unchanged in
November as the associated discounts remained at almost 8 points, which
is higher than in December 1968 just before the previous upward adjust-
ment in ceiling limits. The size of the discount and a substantial rise

III -13
in the rates on new issues of Aaa corporate bonds during the month
combined to make FHA and VA mortgages extremely unattractive investments
for diversified lenders. In November, before adjustment of servicing
costs, residential mortgages yielded the lowest premium above Aaa
corporate bonds on record.

Corporate security and municipal bond markets. With the
seasonal decline in supply at yearend, in late December and early
January, recent yields on corporate new issues receded slightly from
the 1969 high set in the first week of the month. The first large issue
of the new year--a Bell Telephone offering--sold out quickly in early
January at a yield 40 basis points below a comparable offering one month
earlier; underwriters report the bulk of the issue was distributed to
individuals. Rates on municipals continued to advance through the first
three weeks of December, declining only when the new issue supply dried
up during the holidays.

Despite two large postponements late in the month, December
public bond offerings rose more than previously estimated, to a total
of $1.3 billion, a new December record and a high for 1969. Signifi-
cantly, the December volume included a larger-than-usual proportion of
issues by industrial transportation, and mortgage investment companies.
The calendar built up rapidly as several large new filings were made
and a number of convertible bonds were issued in spite of the weakness
in the stock market that was evident in the first three weeks of December.
The heavy volume of public bond offerings combined with a large total
for new stock issues and the usual end-of-year increase in private
placements brought the total corporate security offerings for December
to an estimated $2.9 billion, which would be the largest monthly volume
in three years.

The corporate calendar for January is building rapidly, with
$1.5 billion already scheduled. The staff now estimates that January
public bond offerings will total about $1.7 billion; and, although only
$400 million of bonds have been assigned February issue dates thus far,
the February volume is expected to be at least $1.3 billion. Many of
the firms planning to enter the market early in the year are in capital-
intensive industries, such as power, communications, transportation,
and petroleum, which need to modernize equipment and install new capacity
in order to satisfy steadily growing demand for real output. Further-
more, underwriters report that several industrial firms, under pressure
to improve liquidity ratios and restructure balance sheets, may soon be
induced to enter the market, particularly if the Standard Oil and Ford
financings already scheduled for January prove successful.
New long-term issues by State and local governments amounted
to about $800 million in December. A $125 million Pennsylvania offering,
which came to market just under the 7 per cent ceiling in that state,
accounted for much of the increase of the final total over the preliminary
staff estimate. As yet, the visible supply for the month of January is
relatively light, but the ultimate volume is expected to total about
$900 million. Potential demand for long-term funds by states and munici-
palities remains high and three additional states--Michigan, Florida, and
Maryland--liberalized interest rate ceilings in December, bringing the
total number of states that have statutory ceilings of 7 per cent or more
to 30. Thus, some large issues that have been postponed in recent months
may be reoffered early next year. Already a number of bond offerings by

III -17
the three states that have most recently changed their ceilings have
reappeared on the calendar in the last few days. In addition, it is
reported that several traditionally large borrowers will be in the
market again within 45 days. However, the continuing constraint on
commercial bank acquisitions of municipals, the pressure of market
yields against rate ceilings for many jurisdictions, and the rise in
rates that market participants think would result if supply were to
increase significantly will tend to limit any sharp growth in long-term
municipal borrowing.

Continued high dealer financing costs, generally in a 9-1/2
to 10-1/4 per cent range in New York, and a resulting heightened dealer
reluctance to build up positions have remained the dominant factors in
all sectors of the Government market, with the result that yields have
reacted very sensitively to shifts in market supply or demand conditions.7.45

In the bill market, for example, reinvestment demand from the $1.25
billion of maturing December tax bills not turned in for taxes was
smaller than dealers had anticipated, with the result that positions
were not reduced as readily as expected and rates rose accordingly as
dealers sought to move their holdings. Upward rate pressures alsoarose
from the supply side of the market, with heavy sales of bills by the
Desk for foreign accounts. More recently, bill rates have moved lower,
particularly in the 6-month area, most likely in response to demands
arising out of savings outflows from thrift institutions.
In the market for Treasury coupon securities, investment
demand has been quite light on the whole, and prices drifted steadily
lower throughout December. Just before year-end, bank selling of
Governments developed for the purpose of taking capital losses before
the Tax Reform Act--the provisions of which were unclear to the banks--
became effective. These sales, which put additional downward pressure
on note and bond prices, were especially heavy on the part of small and
intermediate-sized banks and were largely concentrated in short- and
intermediate-term maturities and account for a large part of the rise
in dealers' positions in the under 5-year maturity categories.

Yield changes in the market for Federal Agency securities
have been relatively minor in comparison to the changes in the Treasury
market. In the Agency market as well, however, new highs were set for
yields in most maturity categories. New issue activity in the Agency
market since the last meeting of the Committee was confined to monthly
short-term refinancing operations by the Banks for Cooperatives and the
Federal Intermediate Credit Banks with both Agencies raising only small
amounts of new money. Looking ahead slightly, however, the Farmer's Home
Administration announced last week that on January 22 they will offer
$350-400 million of 5- and 10-year loan notes. A large issue by the
Federal Home Loan Banks is also expected in the latter part of January,
although the exact size is uncertain at this time.

III -21
Other short-term credit markets. During December, short-term
interest rates outside the Treasury bill market continued to move higher.
Rates on 3- and 6-month commercial paper have increased by 50 basis
points since early December to a record high of 9.25 per cent. One-
month finance paper, where the volume of new finance paper issues has
recently been concentrated, was quoted at 9.00 per cent as of January 2,
an increase of about 25 basis points from early December.
Rates on bankers' acceptances increased about 37 basis points
to 9.00 per cent in mid-December after having held steady for about a
month. During December, several of the major dealers in acceptances
announced that, as a result of increased trading activity and daily
rate fluctuations, they would no longer post rates on bankers' accept-
ances. In consequence, rates on all bankers'acceptances should hence-
forth show somewhat more sensitivity to changing credit market conditions
than previously.
NOTE:
The latest figures available on the supply of commercial
paper outstanding report that, in November, such paper increased $848
million, seasonally adjusted, or by 3 per cent, compared to a 6 per
cent rise in October. The November increase was the lowest monthly
gain since March. Bank related paper (not seasonally adjusted)
increased by $252 million in the first 3 weeks of December to a total
of $4,331 reported on December 24.

Federal finance. The Board staff is now projecting a
fiscal 1970 surplus of just $200 million on a unified budget basis
and $2.9 billion on an NIA basis. Passage of the 15 per cent increase
in social security benefits effective January 1, 1970 and a reappraisal
of expected interest payments have substantially altered the expen-
diture outlook toward more outlays (see Appendix A). Staff estimates
of receipts, already well below the Administration's figure, have been
lowered $1.0 billion to take account of lower than expected corporate
and withheld taxes for December and enactment of tax reform and relief
provisions. The necessary adjustment for tax reform was small because
earlier staff estimates had already included the investment credit
repeal, extension of excise taxes, and the drop in the surtax rate.
Reflecting some of these shifts in receipts and outlays,
the end of December balance at the Treasury was $5.3 billion, $600
million lower than projected in the last Greenbook. The Board staff
now estimates that the Treasury cash balance will amount to $4.8
billion at the end of January and drop to a mid-month low of about
$2 billion. In the event the FHLBB were forced to draw down some of
its $4 billion special borrowing line at the Treasury during the
January reinvestment period, the end of month balance could be lower
than the $4.8 billion estimate, and the Treasury would probably have
to borrow temporarily from the System around mid-month. During
February, the balance would fall about $1 billion from its level on
January 31, unless the Treasury chooses to raise some new money in
anticipation of its needs in March. In any case, about $4.5 billion
of cash borrowing will probably be needed sometime in the first quarter
to keep the cash balance up to acceptable operating levels until the
surge of income tax receipts in April.

THE ECONOMIC PICTURE IN DETAIL
International Developments
Balance of payments. Climaxing a year of bizarre events
in the balance of payments, the liquidity balance for December,
according to weekly indicators, registered a surplus on the order of
$2-3/4 billion (not an annual rate). On this basis, the fourth quarter
would show a surplus of about $1-1/4 billion, and the liquidity deficit
for the year would be on the order of $6-3/4 billion. While large
return flows to the United States at year end were expected, the
potentialities were considerably underestimated. In 1968, the liquidity
surplus in the last two weeks of the year was about $1.2 billion; this
year it totaled $2.7 billion. Moreover, the official settlements
balance also showed a sizable surplus as the year ended, amounting
to perhaps $1 billion for the month of December, and a little less for
the entire fourth quarter. For the year, this balance was in surplus
by perhaps $2-3/4 billion.
The flood of receipts at year end is assumed to reflect in
large part the return of funds that had been placed by corporations
and others in the Euro-dollar market and in Deutschemark or other
investments abroad. Some of the return flow was no doubt the result
of the need to comply with the direct investment controls, and will be
reflected in either direct investment capital flows (as it was last year).

IV -2
a reduction in reported corporate short-term assets abroad or an increase
in liabilities to foreigners (such a return of funds borrowed abroad can be
credited against earlier direct investments for purposes of compliance with
the regulations), or in large dividend receipts. Another part of the
inflow may relate to the large unrecorded payments of the earlier part
of the year and may appear in the accounts in the fourth quarter only as
unrecorded receipts. Part of the liquidity surplus is also reported to
be the result of sizable shifts of claims on foreigners from head office
books of banks to their foreign branches.
The surplus in the closing days of the year, unlike that of
1968,benefited only moderately from receipts from foreign governments.
However, there was an improvement over 1968 through the payment of $161
million by Britain, as scheduled, of principal and interest on the postwar
loan.
Apart from the flows of volatile funds, international trans-
actions in the fourth quarter apparently involved no sharp break with the
experience of earlier months. The trade balance was probably not much
changed from the $1.3 billion annual rate of the third quarter, as
discussed below. Outflows of U.S. private capital, other than the kinds
of flows mentioned above, were probably relatively low. New issues of
foreign bonds in the U.S. market were held down by high interest rates,
and purchases of other foreign securities also seemed to have fallen
off. U.S. banks reported a reduction in foreign claims in November,
and may have made further reductions in December, including transfers
of credits to foreign branches.

IV -3
Inflows of private foreign capital to purchase U.S. equity
securities were about $110 million in November, despite a falling
stock market, following a $350 million inflow in October. Unless
there were net liquidations in December, the fourth quarter rate of
inflow was considerably higher than in the summer months, though not
as high as the peak rates of last winter.
The year-end liquidity surplus resulted in a large reduction
in liabilities of U.S. banks to their foreign branches as well as in
U.S. liabilities to foreign central banks. About $1.4 billion of branch
liabilities were run off in the last week of the year, compared to
a reduction of about $.9 billion in the last week of 1968. Part of
the difference probably reflects larger shifts of claims on foreigners
to the accounts of foreign branches. It would appear that some of the
very large increase in demand deposits in U.S. banks on December 31
represents the temporary lodging place of these repatriated funds,
as well as of funds brought back out of other currencies. Outstanding
liabilities to branches at year -- end were about $13.2 billion, somewhat
below the level at mid-year, but about $7 billion above the end-of-1968
amount.
It is doubtful whether in the early days of the year U.S.
banks will add anything like the $1.4 billion that they added to
their liabilities to branches in the first week of 1969. Conditions
in the Euro-dollar market this year are quite different from a year
ago, since most European countries are operating with tight monetary

IV -4
policies, and there is no ready source of funds such as was provided
last year by the reflows from the November 1968 speculation on a
Deutschemark revaluation. There may still be a return flow of U.S.
nonbank funds to the Euro-dollar market to take advantage of high
yields, but it will probably be more difficult to attract private
foreign funds at the expense of foreign monetary reserves.
At the year end, U.S. reserve assets were increased through
the purchase of $500 million of gold from Germany ($200 million of
gold was purchased earlier in December from the BIS), and by an increase
in the IMF gold tranche through drawings of dollars by other countries.
As 1970 began, reserves were increased further by the initial allocation
of $867 million of Special Drawing Rights by the IMF.
U.S. foreign trade. The export surplus fell in November
as exports dropped while imports held at the very strong October level.
For October-November together the export surplus was at an annual rate
of $1.3 billion (balance of payments basis), about the same as in the
third quarter. For calendar 1969, it is likely that the trade balance
was not appreciably different from the $.6 billion recorded in
1968. If not for the effects of the dock workers' strike in early
1969, which reduced exports more than imports, the export surplus in
1969 might have reached $1 billion.
Despite the improvement in our trade performance in the last
half of 1969, the pattern of trade does not fully reflect what might
be expected from cyclical conditions here and abroad, i.e., a strong

IV -5
economic boom in Europe and Japan and a slowing in the growth of
U.S. activity. U.S. imports remained strong in October and November,
while the gain in exports since mid-1969, and particularly in October
and November, depended largely on exceptionally heavy shipments of
agricultural products. Exports of nonagricultural commodities have
also expanded but not as rapidly and perhaps less -- at least through
November -- than might have been expected with production and consumption
abroad pressing against capacity. But export orders for machinery are
rising sharply, promising an acceleration in exports of such equipment
this year. In October-November these orders were about one-third
greater than in the year-earlier period.
Exports in October-November were $39.6 billion at an annual
rate (balance of payments basis), nearly 4 per cent greater than in
the third quarter. The increase was about evenly divided between
agricultural and nonagricultural commodities. Shipments of agricultural
items -- particularly corn and soybeans but also tobacco -- rose by
10 per cent above the high level of the third quarter. Agricultural
exports in October-November were running at an annual rate of close to
$7 billion, an amazing rebound from the strike-depressed level of
$5.5 billion in the first half of 1969 and considerably greater than
the $6.3 billion recorded in calendar 1968. Presently, shipments of
feedgrains and soybeans are benefiting from high demands in our
principal foreign markets -- Europe and Japan -- while supplies of
competing products from East European and Latin American countries are

IV -6
relatively limited until the new harvests become available. For the crop
year ending June 1970, total exports of agricultural commodities are
expected to total only about $6.2 billion.
Exports of nonagricultural products in October-November were
about 3 per cent greater than in the third quarter. The largest advances
were in coal (principally to Japan to feed their booming steel output)
and steel. Shipments of machinery, which had increased sharply in the
third quarter over the average of the first half, expanded further but at
a slower pace. Deliveries of commercial aircraft also were above the low
number shipped in the third quarter.
By areas, the export rise in October-November was concentrated
in shipments to Canada (other than in shipments of automotive equipment
which declined) and Japan. Exports to Western Europe held at the third
quarter level. A moderate rise in sales to Latin America was more than
offset by a decline in shipments to other developing countries.
Imports in October-November were at an annual rate of $38.4
billion (balance of payments basis), 4 per cent greater than in the
third quarter. Imports in each month were about the same and were the
highest since May. Price increases for a number of commodities -- coffee,
copper, nickel and other metals -- appear to be a factor in the continued
strength in imports.
The increase in the value of coffee imports accounted for
about one-fourth of the October-November rise. Other consumer goods

IV -7
(other than automobiles) continued to expand while imports of industrial
material and automobiles, in total, were unchanged. Purchases of foreign
machinery turned down despite the continued increase in domestic invest-
ment outlays.
The large expansion in coffee arrivals reflected renewed
stock-building in anticipation of higher prices and more limited supplies
as a result of reported frost damage to the new Brazilian crop.
The value of imports of iron ore, copper, and other metals used
in the production of durable goods was up slightly and just about offset
a decline in imports of textiles and other nondurable materials. Heavy
arrivals of iron ore probably represent a catching up from the low levels
of the third quarter, depressed because of the extended strike at Canadian
mines last summer.
Arrivals of cars from Canada expanded further in October-November,
but fewer cars were imported from Europe and Japan. Sales of foreign-type
cars in the U.S. increased in October-November but these increased sales
were drawn from stocks, and the usual seasonal stockbuilding of these cars
did not occur this year.
Foreign exchange markets. Foreign exchange trading was very
active during December. The Bundesbank resumed rather heavy sales of
dollars at mid-month after having been out of the exchange market for
nearly two weeks. Selling pressure on the German mark continued through
the end of December. Demand for sterling was strong and the Bank of

IV -8
England registered reserve gains during the month. The Bank of France and
Belgian National Bank were also able to make moderate purchases of dollars
in the market. On the other hand, the Dutch and Italian central banks
suffered small market losses of dollars.
The resumption of selling pressure on the mark at mid-month was
attributed to a number of factors -- including a moderate easing of German
money market conditions after the December 15 German tax date, the sharp
advances in Euro-dollar rates which occurred during the first three weeks
of December, and sizable repatriations from Germany of U.S. corporate
funds for the purpose of complying with OFDI regulations at the year-end.
(See balance of payments section.) On December 19 the Bundesbank removed
the prohibition against interest payments by German commercial banks on
foreign-owned deposits -- put into effect in early 1964 -- to help moderate
the large withdrawals of foreign funds from Germany. The mark rate moved
moderately above its lower limit in rather thin trading during the last
two days of the year (for value after New Year's) and the first trading
day of the new year. But it then fell back close to the lower support
limit.
During December the Bundesbank sold $1.9 billion in the market.
This was partially offset by $750 million of receipts from maturing forward
contracts -- the last of the Bundesbank's outstanding forward contracts to
receive dollars. At the end of December its reserve assets had declined
to an estimated $7.5 billion (including IMF position), somewhat below the

IV -9
$8.2 billion level at the end of 1967 before heavy speculation on a DM
revaluation began.
Sterling ended the year on a strong note. Demand for the pound
was firm throughout the month and the Bank of England purchased $330
million in the market, about $200 million less than in November. The
pound exchange rate pushed to slightly above par late in the month -- the
first time it had been at or above par since April 1968.
The improved position of sterling enabled the British Government
to lift in late December exchange restrictions in effect since 1966 on
purchases of certain foreign currencies for travel abroad. Previously
British citizens were limited to £50 per year for holiday travel abroad.
Under the modified controls, individuals may purchase up to £300 per
journey for foreign holiday travel with no questions asked.
The Swiss franc was under the influence of year-end repatriations
by Swiss commercial banks for liquidity and window-dressing purposes
thoughout December. The Swiss National Bank made swap facilities available
to the banks to facilitate repatriation of dollar assets and did almost
$800 million of swaps -- taking in dollars for Swiss francs. Most of these
swaps will be reversed during January.
Demand for the French franc was firm thoughout December. The
franc rate moved higher and the Bank of France was able to purchase an
estimated $150 million. On January 7 the franc exchange rate moved up
slightly above its new par value -- the first time it had been at or above
par since the devaluation in August 1969.

IV -10
The free market price of gold continued to fall sharply during
December and reached a low point in the London market of $35.00 an ounce
on December 19. Since then it has moved in a range between $35.20 and
$35.00 and seemed to be little affected by the accord reached between the
IMF and the South African Government on gold sales by the latter, announced
by the IMF on December 30.
Euro-dollar rates moved higher as year-end approached, reflecting
the usual seasonal pressures on the Euro-dollar market. Rate increases
were particularly notable in the one-month maturity -- from around 10-7/8
per cent in early December to 12-13/16 per cent on the last two trading
days for which settlement would be made before year-end. Rates generally
declined after year-end, with the one-month maturity again showing the

Part of the upward pressure on Euro-dollar rates in December
apparently arose from the large volume of repatriations of funds by German
banks. According to partial data, German banks reduced their net external
assets by about $1.1 billion in the three weeks ended December 23. Never-
theless, the Bundesbank had a net reserve loss of approximately one billion
dollars in December. Repatriations by U.S. corporations to meet OFDI
guidelines were probably an important factor in these foreign exchange
losses.
Year-end window dressing by Swiss banks was facilitated by BNS
Swiss franc-dollar swaps ($790 million in December). The BNS, in turn,
placed the dollar proceeds of these swaps in the Euro-dollar market, both
directly and through the BIS, thus offsetting the withdrawals by the Swiss
commercial banks.
U.S. corporate year-end repatriations from the Euro-dollar market,
accompanied as they were by very large declines in U.S. banks' liabilities
to their foreign branches, were probably not a major factor in the rise in
Euro-dollar rates.

IV -12
The emerging pattern of current account balances in major
industrial countries.* This year--1970--is likely to see some progress
towards achieving the current account objectives of all of the major
industrial countries, with the important exception of Japan, and, to a
much lesser extent, Canada. The German trade surplus will be reduced,
as strong domestic demand conditions reinforce the impact of the revaluation
of the mark on imports and exports, particularly in the first half of the
year. The rate of growth of German exports will fall, but the impact of
the revaluation will be partially offset by other factors. The deficit
on services and unilateral transfers is likely to increase so that the
current account may be in balance, or even slight deficit,in the second
half of the year.
France will experience a decline in its current account deficit,
although the deficit will remain large. In spite of a slowdown in world
trade, the growth of French exports is expected to accelerate. The growth
rate of imports will fall. The United Kingdom's current account surplus
of around $850 million in 1989 may be enlarged by, perhaps, another
one-half billion dollars. There is a strong possibility that Britain
will even have a small trade surplus for the year, the first since 1958.
* The term "current account" is here defined to include unilateral trans-
fers. The "current account balance" is therefore comparable to the "balance
of goods and services plus unilateral transfers" in the U.S. balance of
payments presentations.

IV -13
Italy's trade surplus will probably decline significantly--
perhaps by about half--while Japan's already very large surplus will become
considerably larger. The Dutch trade deficit, and Canada's trade surplus,
will each decline slightly.

The combined trade surplus of all these countries vis-à-vis the
rest of the world will increase from about $5.4 billion in 1969 to about
$7.3 billion in 1970. The combined current account surplus will also
increase, though less markedly because of the continuing large increase
expected in the German deficit on services and unilateral transfers.
Meanwhile, the trade and current account position of the United States is
also expected to improve. If these expectations for the major countries
are realized, the result will be an improvement in their combined current
account surplus of something on the order of $2-1/2 billion. Some part
of this increase may be reflected in a reduced current account surplus for
other industrial countries. But also implied is some increase in the
combined current account deficit of less developed countries. Unless there
is a corresponding movement of capital, less developed countries will
experience either a smaller increase, or some depletion, of their reserves,
a means of financing that cannot continue for long.

IV -15
Our forecast of a 13 per cent growth in German exports in 1970,
with a slowdown in the second half, reflects the large existing order
backlog for German exports, an expectation of continued high levels of
demand and significant capacity limitations in Germany's major export
markets, and the prospects of price inflation in these markets--all of
which could considerably offset for this year the price effects of the
revaluation. We do not expect German export growth to slow down as much
as the OECD Secretariat forecast of a growth rate of only 4 per cent in
the second half of 1970, primarily because we expect foreign demand for
German output to continue strong; and in the event of a slowdown in the
German economy during this period, German exporters are likely to demonstrate
their usual propensity to offset decreased domestic demand with increased
exporting efforts.
German imports could grow quite rapidly, since the high level
of domestic demand and rather severe pressures on productive capacity
should continue until at least mid-year, with only a moderate easing
expected during the second half of the year. This implies that the
revaluation will have a significant dampening effect on the growth of
aggregate demand only after a considerable time lag.
The overall current account balance should deteriorate somewhat
more than is implied by the OECD forecast of a $400 million surplus for
the year. The increase in remittances Ly foreign workers in Germany--related
to the severe labor shortage--and the increased incentive for Germans to
travel abroad should have a substantial effect on Germany's current account
in 1970.

IV -16
United Kingdom exports are expected to grow at a rate of about
8 per cent, or slightly below that of world trade. Capacity problems in
major export industries, such as engineering, coupled with the likelihood
of continued labor troubles explain why Britain's market shares are likely
to fall slightly in 1970. A rapid rate of growth in output for domestic
uses could also adversely effect exports, by reducing capacity available
for export production and by having an inflationary impact on export prices.
Imports in value terms are expected to increase by 7 per cent
in 1970 on the assumption that real national income will grow at about
3 per cent and import volume--as has been true in the past--will rise at
a somewhat faster rate (5 to 5-1/2 per cent). Prices will rise by about
1-1/2 to 2 per cent.
Our balance of trade forecast may be optimistic. If the
economy grows faster than 3 per cent--as it well may, if the authorities
loosen restraints in what is likely to be an election year--then imports
would probably grow more than 7 per cent. Moreover, imports may be
stimulated by a surge in inventory accumulation, a likely development if
monetary stringency is eased. Because of tight money, British businesses
are currently operating at very small inventory-output ratios. Historically,
there has been a strong positive correlation between imports and stock-
building. Termination of the import deposit scheme before next December
would of course also encourage imports. Largely as a result of the lifting
of travel restrictions, a slight deterioration of the services account by
perhaps as much as $100 million also seems likely this year.

IV -17
No official target for calendar 1970 has been set yet, but
shortly after the 1970 devaluation Chancellor Jenkins announced the goal
of running surpluses on the basic balance of payments of $1.2 billion
each year for several years. If the long-term capital account is in
balance next year--a reasonable possibility--this target stands a good
chance of being met, provided the authorities do not relax current
restraints too rashly.
Trade projections for France for 1970 are difficult since price
adjustments following parity changes are still far from being completed.
The French Government's target is to reach equilibrium on trade account
by mid-1970. Hoever, the current account deficit according to our
estimates will still be large--around $1.5 billion--and may ell prove
unacceptable to the authorities. If the authorities take further measures,
such as extending the very restrictive terms on installment purchases
beyond the present expiration date of January 31, 1970, or increasing
taxes, imports may not be as large as we anticipate.
During the second half of 1969 and the first half of 1970
Italian trade trends will probably be markedly distorted by the effects
of the autumn strikes. In the absence of the strikes, Italian exports
would have increased at annual rates of 20 per cent in the second half
of 1969 and possibly 15 per cent in the first half of 1970 (relative to
the preceding half-year). However, the strikes caused a shift of exports
valued as much as $300 million from the latter half of 1969 to the first
half of 1970, thereby reducing the rate of expansion in the first of these

IV -10
periods and accentuating it in the second. The slower rate of expansion
in the underlying trend of exports in the first half of this year reflects
a slower growth of import demand in other countries, notally France and
the U.S. But we assume that demand for Italian exports will not slow
down as abruptly as might be inferred from the OECD forecast that total
CECD imports will increase only half as fast in the first half of 1970
as in the second half of 1969. But the underlying trend of exports will
slow a further deceleration in the second half of 1970 because of
decelerating demand abroad and increasing inflationary pressures in
Italy.
The strikes also shifted some imports (estimated at $200 million)
from the second half of 1969 to the first half of 1970. This year demand
in Italy will increase rapidly because of recently granted large wage
increases and official policies designed to maintain the expansion of
output. As aggregate demand expands, existing unused capacity will tend
to disappear and upward price pressures will intensify. Abstracting from
the effect of the strikes (which the tables do not), the underlying
annual rate of increase in imports probably would remain at 2. per cent
in the first half of 1970, but would accelerate to 30 per cent in the
second half.
Cur forecast for an improvement in the overall current account
balance of the Netherlands, which roughly agrees with the forecast of the
Dutch Central Planning Bureau, is based upon an expectation that the volume
of exports will increase by approximately 9 per cent during 1970, that of

IV -19
imports by about 7 per cents The expectation of a slightly slower
growth rate for Dutch exports during the second half of the year stems
from the likelihood of some slowdown in the German and U.S. rates of
expansion during this period.
The services account is assumed to remain essentially unchanged.
While the revaluation of the German mark could cause a notable rise in
Dutch tourist receipts, a significant reduction in the growth of world
trade could have an adverse effect on Dutch earnings from shipping.
In making a trade forecast for Canada, we have assumed a low
rate of real economic growth for both Canada and the United States (which
accounts for over 2/3 of Canada's trade), Growth in Canadian real GNP
for 1970 is assumed to be on the order of 1 to 2 per cent, slightly lower
than the forecast of Canadian officials, and less than half the OECD
forecast. This assumption is based on the expectation that the very
restrictive monetary policies being pursued in both countries will result
in zero or negative growth for at least two quarters this year.
A low rate of growth in aggregate expenditure in the United States,
and, particularly, lagging automobile sales, will depress the rate of
growth of Canadian exports. However, some resource-based exports (nickel,
steel and wheat) which suffered declines last year related to special
factors, should recover somewhat in 1970. Machinery and equipment imports
will probably be up fairly strongly in the first part of the year, as
Canadian firms undertake investment projects delayed by widespread
strikes in 1969.

Canadian authorities would not be disturbed by a current
account deficit of the size indicated, which would undoubtedly be financed
mainly by long-term borrowing in the United States. Nor would such a
deficit be incompatible with Canada's desire to lessen inflationary
pressures in the domestic economy. Canada's long-range goal is for
current account balance, but the timetable is vague and not inconsistent
with a higher deficit in times of inflationary pressures.
In Japan, an official balance of payments forecast for 1970 is
not yet available, but the private Japan Economic Research Center has
estimated that exports in 1970 will increase 22.7 per cent over 1969 and
imports will rise 19.7 per cent. The OECD forecast is more conservative,
and places the export and import increases at 13.2 per cent and 15.6 per cent,
respectively. Largely on the basis of recent economic trends in both Japan
and the United States, it would appear reasonable to expect an export
growth of about 20 per cent and a rise in imports of about 10 per cent,
or approximately the same rate as in earlier years. On this basis, a
current account surplus of about $2.7 billion is forecast for 1970.

APPENDIX A: FEDERAL FISCAL POLICY IN 1970*
As a consequence of the recently enacted Tax Reform Act of
1969, Federal fiscal policy is expected to move somewhat more strongly
toward stimulus in the coming year than was projected in previous
Greenbooks. However, a sizable shift toward fiscal ease had already
been built into earlier staff projections, since the staff had anticipated
many of the provisions of the Tax Act. Table I, Part A, shows the
adjustments to earlier staff estimates resulting from passage of the
Tax Reform Act. In the aggregate these adjustments amount to a reduction
of $2.3 billion in the calendar year 1970 budget surplus (NIA basis).
Previous staff projections of the Federal budget had included
the most costly provision of the Tax Act--the reduction of the tax
surcharge from 10 per cent to 5 per cent, effective January 1, 1970,
and the elimination of the surcharge, effective July 1, 1970. Together
these changes reduce NIA Federal receipts for calendar year 1970 by an
estimated $9.4 billion as shown in Part B of Table I. A major portion
of this revenue loss will be reflected in downward revisions in withholding
tax rates in January and also in July of 1970.
The retroactive repeal of the investment tax credit, which
adds about $1.9 billion to calendar 1970 revenues, and the extension of
excise taxes were also included in earlier staff estimates. In addition
to these items, the tax reform and relief provisions of the bill, as
shown in Table I, provide a net additional $.6 billion reduction in
Federal receipts during the year. The Tax Act also included a hike in
social security benefit rates, costing about $4.0 billion in the 1970
calendar year or $1.7 billion more than previous staff estimates.
As a result of the above mentioned items and other projected
changes in Federal receipts and expenditures, the staff now forecasts
a shift in the Federal budget (NIA basis) from a $9.7 billion
surplus in calendar year 1969 to a $5.0 to $6.0 billion deficit in
calendar 1970. The components of this $15 billion adjustment are shown in
Table II. In addition to the tax and social security items discussed
above, the staff is tentatively forecasting a cut of nearly $4 billion
in defense spending during the next year, which will be more than
offset by a $12 billion net increase in nondefense expenditures.
These are interim staff estimates of expenditures that can serve as
stand-in figures until the President's Budget becomes available; they
do not reflect advance knowledge of what the Budget will show.
Due to the projected slowdown in economic growth, discussed
elsewhere in the Greenbook, revenue growth from an expansion in the tax
base is estimated to amount to only $5 billion during the calendar year,
in contrast to the $14 billion that is frequently cited as a normal fiscal
dividend at recent levels of the economy. Also, an increase in unemploy-
ment insurance benefit payments of $1 billion is anticipated. For the
calendar year, these various calculations produce a measured deficit
slightly exceeding $5 billion.
1/ Includes normal growth of social security payments, increased outlays
for interest on the debt, agricultural price supports, new veterans
benefits, increased aid to state and local governments, a federal pay
increase effective July 1, 1970, and other expenditure items.

3/ Due to the projected slowdown in the economy, the $14 billion
fiscal dividend that would be consistent with long-term growth
trends in the economy is expected to be only $5.2 billion in
calendar year 1970.

For fiscal year 1970, current staff estimates suggest a
NIA surplus of $2.9 billion in fiscal 1970, compared to a surplus of about
$5.1 billion that was implied in the September budget review by the
Administration. Projected quarterly totals for the Federal sector in
the national income accounts are given in the budget table at the end of
Section III of the body of Greenbook. The shift toward fiscal
ease during 1970 is expected to result in a deficit beginning in the second
quarter, 1970, with the deficit reaching its highest level (at nearly a
$10 billion annual rate) in the third quarter. As already indicated a
substantial portion of this deficit is a reaction to the projected
slowdown in economic growth and in the rate of price increases.
Comparisons with previous periods of Economic Slowdown
The combination of restrictive monetary and fiscal policies in
1969 seems to be setting the stage for an economic slowdown in 1970. The
question arises whether the substantial shift in fiscal policy during
1970 will again provide excessive stimulus.
Table III shows some data on the budgetary position in three
previous periods when expansion in economic activity was followed by a
slowdown or a recession. In each case the budgetary position in the
last four quarters of expansion is compared to the immediately following
four quarters during which the slowdown occurred and a recovery ensued.
Thus in the four quarters preceding and including the cyclical
peak in 1957, the Federal NIA surplus averaged $3.9 billion, while in the
immediately following four quarters the Federal sector showed a deficit
of $8.2 billion. Hence in the 1957-58 cycylical transition, the shift
in toward deficit amounted to $12.1 billion. But most this shift was due
to the automatic stabilizers, as can be seem in a rough fashion from the
second data line in Table III, which indicates that the high employment
surplus was practically the same during the period of economic expansion
as during the subsequent four quarters of contraction and recovery. In
calculating the high employment budget surplus, the economy is assumed
to grow at according to longer-run trends, and hence the effect on
actual budget receipts and unemployment insurance benefits of short-run
variations in economic growth is removed.
Table III shows that the Federal sector in most instances had a
surplus in the four quarter time span preceding a cyclical peak and in all
of the instances cited here a deficit occurred in the following four
quarters. The 1966 period, however, is an exception, because during that
year the Federal budget showed a small deficit, even before the slowdown.
Moreover, orders for military purchases which precede outlays were
increasing rapidly in 1966. The lagged effects of the stimulative fiscal
policy in 1966, coupled with substantial further stimulation in 1967, probably
contributed to the continuance of inflation at that time.

The situation appears different for calendar 1970. While the
shift toward fiscal stimulas during 1970 is now anticipated to be sizable,
the economy in 1970 should still be reacting to considerable extent to the
momentum of the lagged effects of the fiscal restraint during 1969. The
anticipated large shift toward fiscal stimulus in 1970 partly reflects
the release of the.automatic stabilizers that will come into play if the
economy actually experiences a slowdown in economic growth. Another part
of the shift toward fiscal stimulus is caused by the decline in tax rates
in 1970, chiefly the reduction and expiration of the surtax. In the
previous periods of economic slowdown or recession, tax rates were not
reduced; on the other hand, however, Administration efforts to cut or
limit Federal spending are more intense at present than in previous periods
of economic slowdown.
The Unified Budget in Fiscal 1970
The $5.9 billion surplus for fiscal 1970 forecast by the
Administration in the September budget review could virtually vanish
unless the Administration finds a way to delay outlays or undertake
additional budget cuts as yet unannounced. The staff currently projects
outlays of $195.0 billion (unified budget basis) in fiscal 1970,
about $2.1 billion above the self-imposed ceiling of $192.9 billion
set by the Administration in the September budget review.
Budget receipts, as usual, are difficult to forecast for
the fiscal year, and perhaps the current staff estimate of total
receipts which is a full $3.6 billion below the Administration's
September review is too pessimistic. Differences between these
alternative estimates of receipts hinge not only on different
income assumptions, but also on the appraisal of current collection
data. Preliminary data for December showed lower than expected
corporate and withheld taxes. The Tax Reform /ct of 1969, relative
to our earlier projections, is expected to account for only a $.1
billion reduction in actual tax collections during the fiscal year.

Individual items accounting for the anticipated increase
in outlays are shown in Table IV.

impounded by the administration.
2/ Excludes possible increases in outlays resulting from a failure to
complete certain asset sales (a negative outlay) included in the budget.
3/ Assumes reductions in defense and in other programs.
The largest increase in spending above the level projected
in the September budget review is expected in social security benefit
payments. The tax bill included a 15 per cent rate hike in social
security benefits effective January 1, 1970, costing $1.1 billion
more in fiscal 1970 than the 10 per cent rate increase, effective April 1, 1974
requested by the Administration. A postal rate increase (a negative
expenditure) was included in the Administration estimate for the fiscal year,
but prospects for implementation of this proposal before July 1, 1970 are
now remote. Failure to increase the postal rate is expected to cost
$.3 billion in the current fiscal year. The Board staff expenditure estimate
also includes $.3 billion for Vietnam veterans assistance above the amount
included in the September budget review. The staff estimate excludes
$.5 billion appropriated by Congress for education in the Labor, Health,
Education and Welfare bill, which the President may veto. Also excluded
from the staff expenditure projections is a possible pay increase beginning
in the Spring for Federal employees that could cost $.7 billion in fiscal
1970.

There are two categories of expenditures that are not subject
to tight administrative control which seem to be running well ahead of
budget estimates. The largest is interest on the debt, which the
Administration now estimates will be more than $.9 billion, gross, above
the amount included in the September budget review. The staff has included
$.5 billion net increase over earlier estimates of interest costs. Outlays
by the Commodity Credity Corporation are also expected to be above earlier
Administration estimates by at least $.5 billion. In addition to the
hard to control categories of expenditures mentioned above, there is a
possibility that the Administration will have difficulty completing
nearly $4.0 billion of asset sales that appear as negative outlays in
the fiscal 1970 budget. As of Dec. 1, 1969 asset sales were lagging behind
schedule because of tight credit conditions.

APPENDIX B: THE TAX REFORM ACT OF 1969: A SUMMARY*
The Tax Reform Act of 1969 became law on December 30. While
it contained fewer substantial reforms of the income and profits tax
laws than had been proposed, it will provide considerable general relief
for individuals in the years to come. A summary of the bill's major
provisions follows.
The personal exemption will be increased to $625 for calendar
1970 (effective July 1 at $650 for withholding purposes), to $650 in
1971, $700 in 1972, and finally to $750 in 1973.
In 1971, the maximum standard deduction will be $1,500 or
13 per cent of adjusted gross income, whichever is less. The 1972
ceiling will be 14 per cent or $2,000, and the levels for 1973 and
beyond will be 15 per cent or $2,000.
The minimum standard deduction will be $1,100 in 1970,
$1,050 in 1971, and finally $1,000 in 1972. In order to restrict the
benefits of the minimum standard deduction to low income taxpayers,
there is a trade-off during 1970 whereby the deduction allowable is
reduced $1 for every $2 of taxable income reported. In 1971, the
phaseout is $1 of deduction lost for ever $15 of taxable income; but
after 1971, the $1,000 minimum deduction will be available to all
taxpayers regardless of their income level. ["This minimum standard
deduction plan is often called the low income allowance.]
Rates for single taxpayers will be reduced to a level just
20 per cent above rates on joint returns.
In 1971, the maximum tax rate on wages, salaries, and pro-
fessional fees ("earned income") will be 60 per cent, except for those
individuals who have tax-preferred income in excess of $30,000 per
year. The maximum rate in 1972 and beyond will be 50 per cent.
"Tax-preferred income" of individuals and corporations in
excess of $30,000 plus the amount of regular income taxes paid will
be taxed at a 10 per cent rate. "Tax preferred income" includes half
of capital gains, the excess of accelerated over straight line depreciation,
the excess of depletion allowances over the cost of the property involved,
the excess of bad debt deductions over actual losses, and four other
minor categories of "income".
Individuals will have to pay half of their marginal tax
rates on capital gains realized in excess of $140,000 per year.
This provision could mean effective tax rates of up to 35 per cent
on large capital gains, instead of the current maximum of 25 per cent.

Division of Research and Statistics.

Corporations will pay a flat 30 per cent on net long term
capital gains, instead of the current 25 per cent rate.
¶Financial institutions will pay ordinary income tax rates
on capital gains realized on corporate and government bonds and other
evidences of indebtedness.
Commercial banks will be allowed deductions for only those
additions to bad debt reserves that reflect actual bad-debt loss
experience. The full impact of this provision would come in 1988,
after gradual reductions from the present reserve allowance of 2.4
per cent of eligible loans to 1.8 per cent in 1970, 1.2 per cent in 1976,
and .6 per cent in 1982.
¶[In 1970, mutual savings banks and S&L's will no longer
have the option of using the "3 per cent method" 1/ of computing
deductions for bad debt reserves; and the alternative method of de-
ducting 60 per cent of taxable income for bad debt reserves will
become less attractive over a 10-year period as the deductible percentage
falls to 40 per cent of taxable income.
Effective July, 1969, 200 per cent declining balance depreciation
will be limited to new residential buildings, while used housing may be
depreciated on a 125 per cent base if it has at least 20 years of useful
life remaining. New commercial and industrial buildings will be
depreciable by the 150 per cent declining balance method, but only
straight line depreciation will be allowed on used non-residential
buildings. Present law allows 200 per cent depreciation of all new
buildings and 150 per cent for buildings that have changed owners.
¶The percentage depletion allowance for oil and gas will
be reduced from 27-1/2 per cent to 22 per cent. Other mineral
depletion allowances will also be reduced by 1-2 per cent.
¶After 1975, groups of controlled corporations will be
allowed only one $25,000 exemption from the corporate surtax.
Formerly tax-exempt, foundations will have to pay an
annual supervisory tax equal to 4 per cent of net investment
income.
There are, of course, many other provisions in the Act besides
these tax reform and relief actions described above; but the only other
provisions with major revenue impact are: extension of the surcharge at
a 5 per cent rate through June 30, 1970; repeal of the investment tax
1/ Whereby 3 per cent of the net increase in mortgage loans outstanding
may be deducted from taxable income

credit; extension of the present excise taxes for one more year; and a
15 per cent increase in Social Security benefits effective January, 1970.
