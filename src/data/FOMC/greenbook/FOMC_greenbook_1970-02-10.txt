SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK
Outlook for economic activity
The weakness in over-all economic activity evident in late
1969 has carried into 1970. Tentative estimates suggest that in-
dustrial production declined again in January--for the sixth consecutive
month. The decline reflected further cutbacks in output of autos and
other consumer durable goods, and probably in defense equipment, with a
major new element introduced by a sharp reduction in output of steel.
Retail sales remained sluggish in January, according to available weekly
data, and auto sales declined sharply further.
These developments and others lend substantial support to
the view that real GNP is likely to show an absolute decline in the
current quarter, even with the GE strike coming to an end, With employ-
ment and income gains slowing, only a modest rise can be anticipated
in consumer spending this quarter despite the reduction of the surtax
to 5 per cent. Federal defense spending is estimated to decline
significantly, consistent with the Budget document, and residential
construction activity is likely to fall sharply in lagged reflection of
the previous declines in housing starts. Inventory accumulation is
also expected to decline further in the first quarter, as businessmen
adjust production to the general weakening in demand.
The main expansive force in the economy continues to be
business spending for fixed capital. For some time, however, additions
to business capacity--with certain exceptions such as public utilities--

I- 2
have exceeded the rise in demands for current output. Given this
growing imbalance and in light of the prospects for sharply reduced
profits, expenditures for plant and equipment still seem likely to fall
short of those reported in the Commerce-SEC survey; we have assumed a
modest shortfall.
We envisage little change in real GNP between the first and
second quarters. On the one hand, the very large and retroactive
increase in social security benefits to be paid in April will have a
stimulating effect on consumer spending. On the other hand, the
further weakness in residential construction that already appears in
train, continued declines in defense spending, and a further downward
adjustment in inventory investment are likely to preclude any signifi-
cant economic expansion in the second quarter.
Outlook for resource use and prices
Demands for labor have eased considerably in recent months,
and the manufacturing capacity utilization rate has fallen sharply.
More easing in resource use is anticipated. Even if the G.E. strikers
return to work in the very near future, the industrial production index
is expected to decline further for the first quarter as a whole.
In the labor market, additional cutbacks in auto and defense
production probably resulted in a further reduction of manufacturing
employment in January. Claims for unemployment insurance continued to
rise sharply, suggesting that the over-all unemployment rate will also
show a sizable increase in January. Over the first half of 1970, our

I -3
projections continue to show little change in total nonfarm employ-
ment, some decline in manufacturing employment, and a rise in the un-
employment rate to over 4.5 per cent by mid-year.
The tentative G.E. settlement provides for an average annual
increase in wages and fringes of around 7.0 per cent. This has been
characterized as relatively moderate, which indicates something about
the intensity of expectations about upward wage business this year.
Major contracts covering about 2-1/2 million workers are scheduled for
renegotiation by mid-year. With living costs continuing to rise
rapidly, union pressure for large wage increases will continue strong
and settlements are likely to be substantial. Nevertheless, we still
anticipate some slowing this year in the rate of increase of private
nonfarm hourly earnings, primarily because easing demands for labor are
likely to result in shorter workweeks and less overtime pay at premium
rates.
Despite the softening in over-all demands, price developments
continue to be disappointing. Upward pressures on prices are being
maintained by increases in unit labor costs throughout the economy, by
continued increases in costs of materials and transportation, and by
attempts to limit erosion to profit margins. But a slowing of the price
advance is likely to become progressively more evident if, as now
expected, over-all demands remain relatively sluggish and manpower and
industrial resources become more ample. We are still projecting some
moderation over the year in the rate of price advance.

I -4
Prospective Financial Developments
A few signs of lessened pressure seem to be developing both
in demands for bank credit and in the supply. But thus far these
tendencies have been very limited. For the over-all squeeze on bank
deposits to moderate significantly, sizeable additional declines in
short-term market rates are probably necessary, not withstanding the
higher Regulation Q ceiling rates. Nevertheless, bankers seem to have
become somewhat less tense about the extent they expect bank reserve
positions to be subjected to near-term pressures.
The backlog of outstanding loan commitments at banks has
apparently been reduced, and there are reports from some quarters that
current business loan demands are falling short of bankers' forecasts.
These reports are consistent with the staff projection of further slacken-
ing in economic activity and inventory growth. Also, it is probable that
some part of the heavy continuing volume of capital market financing by
corporations is being used to repay short-term debt.
Even so, the actual volume of business loan growth seems
unlikely to slow appreciably in the near-term from its reduced pace of
the second half of last year. Many businesses are continuing to carry
through on capital expansion programs at a time when their liquidity
has been substantially depleted and their profits are being squeezed.
Consequently, total external financing needs of businesses remain large;
and there are probably many would-be borrowers in the wings ready to
respond to any relaxation of bank lending policies, if one were to develop.
If rates on short term market securities remain close to their
current levels, the supply of deposits available to meet demands for

I -5
bank credit is not likely to grow and may even contract. While
liberalization of ceiling rates on bank time and savings deposits
has apparently helped to slow the rate of deposit attrition at some
banks, any significant net increase in outstanding time and savings
deposits will probably depend on a sizeable further drop in market
yields. Some moderate growth in private demand deposits may develop,
but this would be unlikely to offset a contraction in time deposits.
Over the near-term, therefore, banks are likely to continue to rely
heavily on non-deposit sources of funds.
Securities markets. In securities markets, a heavy flow of
security offerings seems likely throughout the first quarter, reflecting
the pressing continuing needs for funds of nonfinancial corporations,
State and local governments, and Federal agencies. Projected corporate
demands on capital markets are the largest for any first quarter on
record--totaling over $4 billion in publicly offered bonds and over
$2 billion in stocks. This heavy volume reflects both the general
financial squeeze on businesses already noted and the sustained demand
by public utilities, communications companies, and the petroleum industry--
all of which are now in the midst of large long-range expansion programs.
New security offerings by State and local governments are
expected to remain close to the recently expanded rate of $1 billion or
so a month. As rate ceilings are removed in additional States, the
leeway for expanded borrowing will grow despite the high levels of current
yields. However, with bank funds still constrained, the backlog of
unsatisfied State and local financing needs will probably continue to

I -6
mount. Similarly, the FNMA and the FHLBB can be expected to continue
pressing to raise whatever new money the market will bear.
With the current quarterly Treasury refinancing coming to
an apparently highly successful conclusion, pressures from Federal
financing will not be especially large over the rest of the quarter.
Net cash needs of the Treasury have been variously estimated at $3.5
to $5 billion for the remainder of the fiscal year, depending partly
on the size of attrition assumed in the refinancing. This amount is
likely to be raised in the Treasury bill market in two operations--one
around the end of February and the other around the end of March.
Mortgage markets. As in the case of commercial banks, the
recent liberalization of ceiling rates at nonbank thrift institutions
seems unlikely to produce any very significant step up of savings flows
to such institutions over the current quarter unless there is a rather
substantial further decline of rates on market securities. Without
such a change, and even with continuing massive support from the quasi-
public Federal agencies, mortgage commitments should continue to decline.
In the near-term, therefore, mortgage credit should become still less
available and more costly.
Interest rates. The just-published Federal Budget and the
President's comments on its possible implications for monetary policy
have contributed very recently to an easing of upward pressures on
market interest rates. In most market sectors there have been significant
yield declines. This strengthening of market expectations about the
prospects for some near-term lessening of monetary restraint may carry
the declines still further. But the heavy near-term financing calendar

I -7
in securities markets will act as a brake on any such development.
Thus, unless the current market expectations of a lessening in monetary
restraint seem to be being confirmed, it appears unlikely that rate
declines will proceed far enough over the next few weeks to make the
new liberalized rate ceilings at banks and nonbank thrift institutions
fully competitive.
Balance of payments outlook
Prospects remain good for some moderate improvement in the
IT. S. balance on goods and services in coming months. The December dip
in imports to less than we had expected. Somewhat surprisingly,
imports of machinery as well as consumer durables were smaller in
the fourth quarter than in the third; in the case of machinery
this perhaps reflected tightening supply conditions abroad. Economic
activity in leading industrial countries abroad has accelerated in
recent months and further advances in U.S. exports can reasonably
be expected.
The over-all balance of payments is likely to continue in
fairly heavy deficit on the liquidity basis. The exceptionally large
December surplus--which reflected further reflows of corporate and
unidentified U.S. funds that had moved into German marks before
the revaluation, as well as year-end corporate movements -is
irrelevant as a guide to current developments, even if averaged
together with the rather large January deficit. Such an averaging
is justified only with respect to whatever part of the inward move-
ment of corporate funds in December went out again in January; such
flows were presumably mainly from, and then back to, the Euro-dollar
market.

I-8
Large question marks attach to any projection of the official
settlements balance. Liabilities of U. S. banks to their foreign branches,
after declining in December and then rising part way back, leveled off
after mid-January. At current interest rate relationships it is doubtful
whether the rise in these liabilities will be renewed. So long as no
significant runoff occurs, the official settlements balance will tend to
be close in magnitude to the liquidity deficit.

THE ECONOMIC PICTURE IN DETAIL
Domestic Nonfinancial Scene
Gross national product. Real growth in the economy halted
in the fourth quarter, according to the official preliminary GNP
estimates. Lack of growth resulted from a slowing in inventory accum-
ulation, as well as continued sluggishness in consumer outlays, weakness
in residential construction, and curtailed spending for defense.
Recent weeks have brought further signs of weakening demand
and additional downward adjustments in production. Retail sales appar-
ently changed little in January, with durable goods sales particularly
weak. New car sales dropped sharply, auto production was again cut,
and industrial production apparently declined for the sixth month in a
row. There have been increasing reports of employment layoffs and
shorter workweeks, particularly in durable goods manufacturing indus-
tries. Insured unemployment continued to rise and by the end of January
had shot up to the highest level in five years.
With the lagged effects of monetary policy continuing to
restrict private expenditures and the new Budget proposing additional
cuts in Federal purchases of goods and services, a pattern of weakness
in economic activity in the immediate future is even more likely than
it seemed earlier. We now expect current dollar increases in GNP of
only $7 billion in the current quarter and $9 billion in the second
quarter, as compared with $18 billion in the third quarter of 1969. In

II -2
real terms, this implies an actual decline in GNP of about 1-1/2 per
cent, annual rate, this quarter, and no increase in the second quarter.
Federal defense outlays in the new Budget are projected to
continue to drop throughout 1970. Estimated reductions of the armed
forces, from 3.5 million in the fourth quarter of 1969 to 3.2 million
in the second quarter of 1970, cuts in Federal civilian defense employ-
ment and curtailed demand for military goods are expected to reduce
defense purchases by about $4-1/2 billion, annual rate, between the
fourth and second quarters. Moreover, nondefense purchases are projected
about $1 billion below our previous estimates.
Residential construction continued to weaken toward year-end,
and with the flow of savings shrinking and building permits dropping, a
further reduction in construction activity is anticipated during the
first half of this year. Total residential outlays in the fourth
quarter were maintained at the third quarter level only by an estimated
increase in expenditures for alterations and additions. Housing starts
dropped to 1.25 million units, annual rate, in December, the lowest
since late 1967, and for the quarter as a whole averaged 1.3 million
units. Assistance from FNMA and the FHLB should moderate somewhat the
decline in activity in coming months, but starts are nevertheless pro-
jected to dip to one million units in the spring quarter with outlays
for residential structures down about $5-1/2 billion, annual rate, from
the fourth quarter.
Expenditures by States and localities also continue to be
affected adversely by the high cost and limited availability of funds.

II -3
Outlays in the first half of this year may increase somewhat more
rapidly than the unusually slow rate in the last half of 1969. Federal
grants are expected to increase and tax rates are being adjusted upward,
but with tax receipts held down by slower economic expansion and bond
markets continuing tight, growth of these outlays is expected to con-
tinue below the increases typical of most recent years.
As far as consumers are concerned, there is little in the
current situation to suggest a change in underlying factors which eroded
consumer buying attitudes and weakened retail sales in the past half
year. The recent tax reform measure should have a stimulative effect
on growth of disposable income and,thus, on consumption, particularly
in the second quarter when retroactive Social Security benefits are
paid out. But these income gains may be offset in part by further weak-
ness in employment and reduced hours of work. Moreover, an atmosphere
permeated by reduced overtime, production cutbacks and rising unemploy-
ment is not likely to be conducive to stimulating expenditures, and
only moderate gains in consumption are projected for the first half.
Consequently, the saving rate is expected to rise from the already
relatively high fourth quarter level.
In contrast, business fixed investment is expected to remain
an expansive sector during the first half of 1970, although the effect
of the G.E. strike may dampen the increase somewhat in the current
quarter. But, with sales continuing weak and widespread reports of
reduced profits, we are holding to our projection of progressively
smaller quarterly increases and a somewhat more modest rise in these

II -4
outlays for the first half (and the year as a whole) than indicated by
the recent Commerce-SEC survey.
In summary, we look for final sales to grow by only about
$9 billion in the present quarter, and by about $11-1/2 billion in the
second quarter, when the increased Social Security payments support a
larger rise in consumer outlays. In addition, a reduced rate of inven-
tory accumulation also is now expected in the next few months--as further
production adjustments are made as a result of continued weak durable
goods sales, additional cuts in defense outlays and high costs of carry-
ing inventories--which should reduce the growth of GNP in the first
quarter of 1970 slightly below our previous estimate.
Despite the halt in real economic growth, prices continued
to increase at a rapid rate in the fourth quarter. Apathetic retail
sales, reduced defense purchases, and excessive production capacity,
should tend to moderate price increases somewhat in the future, but food
prices appear likely to continue to move up for a time and no significant
slowdown is evident in prices of services. We are now projecting some-
what less slowing of the GNP deflator, to about a 4 per cent annual rate
in the second quarter of 1970 compared with a rise of 4.4 per cent in
the fourth quarter of 1969.
Growth in GNP is still expected to resume after midyear, but
the Budget proposed postponement of the Federal pay raise from July 1
to the end of the year, and the larger cuts now planned in defense out-
lays than anticipated are likely to dampen somewhat the rebound earlier
predicted for the third quarter. Nevertheless, recovery of construction

II -5
activity that would be expected to follow after a lag, an assumed
easing of monetary restraint plus elimination of the surcharge on
July 1 should stimulate recovery of final sales and output, and help
to stabilize inventory investment during the second half. However,
with Federal purchases expected to continue declining, and business
fixed investment likely to level off, we anticipate only modest gains
in over-all output. As a result, pressure on resources should continue
to moderate, and some further slackening of price increases is projected
by yearend.

Industrial production. Industrial production in January is
estimated to have declined about .5 per cent to an index level of
around 170 per cent--down 2.5 per cent from July and only 0.5 per cent
above a year earlier. The decline since July--an annual rate of 5 per
cent, of which almost 1 per cent represents the direct effects of the
G.E. strike--mainly reflects curtailments in output of consumer durable
goods--including autos, appliances, television, and furniture--and
defense equipment.
Sales of new domestic autos in January were down one-tenth
from December--and one-sixth from a year earlier--to an annual rate of
6.8 million units, the lowest level in almost 3 years. Auto output was
cut 7 per cent further in January to an annual rate of 6.8 million
units and February production schedules have been revised downward to
a 6.3 million unit rate: Unit stocks of autos declined about 7 per cent
seasonally adjusted, over January (and were 8 per cent below a year
earlier); but the stock/sales ratio remained unusually high, at 64 days.
Among other final products, output of defense equipment
apparently declined further in January and truck production, after hold-
ing at record levels through December, appears to have slowed somewhat.
Television production, however, rose from the reduced December level.
With respect to materials, output of raw steel was down
sharply in January. The fall-off stemmed from large inventories held
by producing mills (at the end of December they were close to the early
1968 peak reached in anticipation of a nationwide strike), sharp curtail-
ments in steel consumption in the consumer durable goods industries, and

II -9
some cutbacks in farm equipment and construction industries. Decreased
domestic demand has been only partly offset by a continued sharp rise
in steel exports. Production of other materials used to produce consumer
durable goods also is estimated to have declined further in January.
The mainstay to industrial production since mid-1968 has been
the record levels of output of industrial and commercial equipment,
excluding the effects of the G.E. strike, and, at least until recently,
output of nondurable materials. Cutbacks in production of consumer
durable goods have been large and further reductions are anticipated in
the first quarter of 1970, in line with the staff projection of a 2 per
cent decline in personal consumption expenditures for these goods.
Auto assemblies in the first quarter are scheduled at an
annual rate of around 6.5 million units, down 15 per cent from the
fourth quarter. Output of home goods is estimated to be down somewhat
further in the first quarter, even after allowance for the G.E. settle-
ment, in view of the anticipated sluggishness of retail sales and
efforts to cut back factory and retail inventories.

If the G.E. strike is settled this week, the rise in output
of home goods in February should about offset the decline indicated in
automotive products. The settlement would also result in an increase
in production of business and defense equipment and industrial materials
which should counter-balance decreases in other industrial materials and
products. The net result of the return to work at G.E. would appear to
be little changed in February in the total industrial production index.
Retail sales. Weekly figures suggest that January sales may
have been about unchanged both from the December level and the fourth
quarter average. A sizable decline is indicated in sales at durable
goods stores, largely because of the sharp drop in deliveries of new cars.
Sales at most types of nondurable goods stores apparently rose in January.

II -11
A continued plateau of retail sales--with perhaps some
further weakness in durable goods--is suggested by recent declines in
the University of Michigan index of consumer sentiment. The more
sluggish pace of sales in 1969--only 4 per cent higher than in 1968,
and in real terms half a per cent below 1968--apparently had been fore-
shadowed by the Michigan index of consumer sentiment.

Consumer credit. There was a dramatic deceleration of the
rise in consumer instalment credit outstanding during December. On a
seasonally adjusted annual rate basis, the increase for the month was
only $5.0 billion compared with $7.4 billion in November and $9.3 billion

II 12
in December a year ago. For 1969 as a whole, outstanding instalment
credit rose $8.3 billion, somewhat less than in 1968.
Other consumer goods paper and personal loans accounted for
all of the advance during December. Auto credit outstanding declined
for the first time since April 1967 and only the third time in the past
8 years; home improvement credit fell back for the fifth time in the
past six months.
On a holder basis, the increase in outstandings at sales
finance companies was the smallest in nearly two years. Commercial
banks accounted for about one-half of the over-all increase in consumer
paper during December, a larger share than in other recent months. The
relatively strong showing of commercial banks in December is traceable
in large part to a record advance in nonautomotive consumer goods paper
which, in turn, was mainly attributable to an exceptionally sharp rise
in bank credit card outstandings. Similarly, the increase in check-
credit outstandings, while much smaller in volume, accounted for about
one-half of the rise in bank personal loans--the category in which
check-credit is included.

Cyclical indicators. The Census leading composite indicator
(trend adjusted) declined slightly in December, according to preliminary
calculations. This was the third successive monthly decline and the
series is now 1.5 per cent below the September peak. The coincident
composite also dropped slightly in December from its November peak.
Most previous declines of comparable magnitude in the leading
composite have been followed by adjustments in general business activity,
ranging from a decreased rate of growth, as in late 1962, to declines as
large as the postwar recessions. The size and duration of declines in
the composite index have not indicated reliably what the magnitude of
the subsequent adjustment was likely to be.

Leading series declining in December included new orders for
durable goods, private housing building permits, common stock prices,
and the ratio of price to unit labor cost. There were partly offsetting
increases in the manufacturing workweek, initial unemployment claims
(inverted), contracts and orders for plant and equipment (reflecting a
jump in commercial and industrial building contracts, which have

II -14
fluctuated widely all year around an advanced level), and industrial
materials prices. But except in the case of the materials price index,
such increases as occurred in individual leading indicators were slight.
All of the leading series except the materials price index are below
levels reached earlier in the year.
New orders and shipment. New orders for durable goods
declined 4 per cent further in December. It was the third successive
decline and the drop since September was about the size as that during
the same period in 1966. A substantial part of the reduction was in
motor vehicles and parts, but defense products, capital goods, and iron
and steel also contributed. Shipments and unfilled orders for durable
goods also fell.

decline was mainly in autos, other consumer durables and steel. Order-
ing of defense goods, while below year-ago levels, was up from the
sharply reduced average of the second and third quarters, and ordering
of business equipment continued at a high level, above the third quarter
average, although below the September peak.
Inventories. Book value of manufacturers' inventories rose
in December at about the reduced November rate. Durable goods inventory
growth slowed, reflecting in part the G.E. strike, but stocks of non-
durable goods increased.

Construction and real estate. Seasonally adjusted private
housing starts continued to decline in December and, at an annual rate
of 1,245 thousand (including farm starts) were the lowest since June
1967. While multifamily starts, which had accounted for most of the
reduction in other recent months, turned slightly upward in December,
single family starts dropped to a new low for the year. Among regions,
only the South failed to decline. Based on the continued downward
pressures on outstanding commitments and on total building permits at
the year's turn some further decline in housing starts was indicated
for January, possibly to less than a 1.2 million annual rate.

1/ Seasonally adjusted annual rates; preliminary.
With starts for the fourth quarter as a whole at a 1.31
million annual rate, starts for 1969 totaled 1,463,000. Although well
below basic requirements, this number came close to the improved 1968
total; including an addition 390,000 mobile home shipments (compared
with 317,000 in 1968), the combined count of new residential units for
the year was actually the largest since 1950. Other striking develop-
ments last year included: multifamily starts reached a record 548,000,
despite an accelerated decline in the fourth quarter, and accounted for
an unprecedented 44 per cent of total starts. Also, Government-
underwritten starts, benefiting particularly from sustained support of
FNMA in the market for Government-underwritten mortgages, averaged a
fifth of total starts. While this share was only moderately greater
than in 1968, it was the highest since 1962.

II -18
Labor market. Signs of reduced demands for labor have become
increasingly evident and total unemployment is expected to rise in
January. Increased layoffs of experienced blue-collar workers--especially
in the auto, aircraft, and aerospace industries--caused initial claims
for unemployment insurance payments to rise sharply in January, extending
the increases which began last spring. About 1.4 million workers were
drawing unemployment insurance benefits last month, an increase of 22 per
cent from the comparable period a year earlier and the highest number
since early 1965. The higher levels of insured unemployment probably
include disproportionate numbers of adult men, and both their jobless
rate and the over-all unemployment rate are likely to rise in January.

Aggregate wage and salary payments rose at an annual rate of
6 per cent in the fourth quarter, or less than two-thirds as rapidly as
earlier in 1969. The slowing--which mainly reflected developments in

II -19
manufacturing, where wages and salaries rose only 1 per cent (annual
rate)--was caused by smaller over-all growth, reductions in average
weekly hours, and the G.E. strike.

Lessening demands for consumer durables (especially autos)
and cuts in Federal spending on defense and space programs reduced
manufacturing production, employment and hours of work in the fourth
quarter. Employment levels and income flows were further affected by
the G.E. strike which has kept about 130,000 workers off payrolls since
late October. As a result of these factors, manufacturing employment
declined at a 3-1/2 per cent annual rate from the third to the fourth
quarter while cuts in overtime reduced average weekly hours.

The rise in average hourly earnings of factory production
workers slowed to a 4 per cent annual rate in the fourth quarter, as
compared with an annual rate in excess of 6 per cent during the first
three quarters of 1969. The slowing was due almost entirely to reduc-
tions in overtime work. The impact of reduced overtime was especially
apparent in durable goods industries, where average overtime work was
sharply curtailed. Straight-time hourly wages of factory workers,
however, appear to be rising at about the same rate as in early 1969,
or even slightly faster. In private nonmanufacturing industries, also,
hours of work declined slightly but average hourly earnings and compen-
sation per manhour continued to rise about as rapidly as earlier in 1969.
The moderate fourth quarter reduction in working hours and
the slowing of employment growth were accompanied by a resumption of
productivity gains in the nonfarm sector, after three quarters of
decline. Employers were apparently reluctant to adjust employment to
the slower growth of demand early in 1969, but erosion of profits and
weakness of demand appear to have resulted in adjustments in the fourth
quarter. These adjustments in employment and hours, in turn, resulted

II -21
in slower growth in aggregate wages and salaries, which together with
the still rapid rise of consumer prices resulted in virtually no change
in real disposable personal income in the fourth quarter, compared to a
3 per cent annual rate of increase over the first three quarters of 1969.
Industrial relations. After over 3 months of strike, a
tentative 40-month agreement has been reached in the G.E. dispute which
provides increases in wages and benefits that are relatively moderate
in the light of recent major settlements. Wage rates would be increased
by about 7-1/2 per cent (25 cents) in the first contract year, as com-
pared with a median first-year increase of 8.3 per cent in major
contracts negotiated in all industries during 1969. Additional wage
increases of 15 cents each after 13 and 27 months, and a maximum cost-
of-living adjustment of 8 cents a year are also provided. Over the life
of the contract, the increase in wages and fringes is estimated to
average around 7 per cent a year, also less than the median life-of-the
contract increase for all major agreements reached in 1969.
With many large--and very strong--unions negotiating new
contracts this year (teamsters, construction, rubber, and auto workers),
the increase received in the G.E. settlement is not likely to prove to
be pattern-setting.

II -22
Wholesale prices. Wholesale prices increased at an estimated
annual rate of 8.3 per cent from mid-December to mid-January--faster
than any month since last May--with the acceleration largely the result
of an exceptionally sharp increase in prices of processed foods and
feeds. The average price of industrial commodities rose at a rate
of 4.2 per cent, about the same as the average of the last six months.

Note: These percentage changes may differ from those derived from

The large rise in the price of foods and farm products resulted
from increases for a wide variety of agriculturally-based commodities
including meats, animal feeds, sugar, grains, milk, and coffee, although
declines for livestock, fresh fruits, and eggs held down the extent of
the rise. Some of the increases may be reversed this month and help
produce a smaller increase in the February index for foods and farm
products. The price of raw sugar already has dropped below the
quotation on the January pricing date. If weather conditions do not

II -23
deteriorate over central U.S., a reversal in the prices of manufactured
animal feeds and grains can be expected.
Among the more important increases in prices of industrial
commodities were those for metals, paper products, and machinery and
equipment. Lumber and wood products declined further and motor vehicles
were reported slightly lower.
Since the January pricing date, price announcements have
centered on steel products. Increases of about 4.6 per cent on steel
plates, structurals, and sheet piling are slated for March 1. Sheet
products prices rose 3-4 per cent on February 1, eliminating the
savings available under a new billing system put into effect on
January 1. Extras were also raised on sheet products, which account
for more than one-third of the steel industry's total shipments and are
a major material used by manufacturers of such items as automobiles,
appliances, machinery, and farm buildings. With the announced February
and March increases, prices will have been increased this year on about
two-thirds of the tonnage shipped by the industry, and average prices
of steel mill products will have been raised about 1-1/2 per cent.
Prices of steel scrap are also higher as a result of the
unexpectedly large demand for scrap for domestic use and export and the
reduced supply resulting from transportation problems and curtailed
output.
Over the past year, farm commodities accounted for about
40 per cent of the rise in wholesale prices, and industrial commodities
for about 60 per cent. Almost one-half of the industrial price rise

II -24
was accounted for by metals, and about 20 per cent by machinery and
equipment.

Consumer prices. Consumer prices rose at an annual rate of
over 7 per cent in December--slightly faster than in the fourth quarter
or over the year 1969. About half the increase reflected higher food
prices, with most of the remainder due to service costs.
The unusually large increase in food prices from mid-November
to mid-December in large part reflected adverse weather conditions.
Fresh vegetable and egg prices were up very sharply. Bakery and dairy
products also increased while meat prices were unchanged.

tinued severe. Egg prices remain high.
Among non-food commodities, new and used car prices declined
in December and household durable goods prices--which had been
decelerating--were unchanged.
Service prices in December advanced more than in the previous
two months. Medical care costs continued to rise at a rate somewhat
below that earlier in the year, but public transportation costs, and
insurance and financing charges moved up rapidly. January service prices
will reflect the increase in mortgage rates on government-underwritten
mortgages and the rise in subway fares in New York.

Over the past year, food prices rose 7 per cent compared to
about 6 per cent for all components except food. Apparel prices rose
5.3 per cent over the past year, somewhat less than in 1968. Over the
last four years food prices at retail have moved up 17.5 per cent, about
the same as other prices measured by the CPI.
Prices of new cars rose only 2.1 per cent in 1969 and house-
hold durables, 3.4 per cent. However, the index for consumer durable
commodities as a whole rose 4.5 per cent. The disparity reflects for
the most part the influence of "home purchase" prices, which are not
made available separately by the BLS. Costs of home-ownership rose over
10 per cent last year compared to 3.7 per cent for rent.

THE ECONOMIC PICTURE IN DETAIL
Domestic Financial Situation
Bank credit. Commercial bank credit on a seasonally adjusted
basis, dropped sharply in January, with declines recorded in both loans
and investments. The decline in loans reflected substantial loan sales
to affiliates. Total bank credit adjusted for such sales declined at
a 3 per cent annual rate.
The decline in investment holdings was attributable to a
continued runoff of U.S. Treasury securities, with holdings of other
securities increasing moderately over the month. The January seasonally
adjusted decline in governments, which reflects in part the absence of
the usual Treasury January financing, marks the fifth consecutive month
of decline in these investments, which for these months aggregated more
than $7 billion. Over the same period, holding of other securities
increased about $600 million.
Total loans on bank books declined $1.3 billion in January,
with bank loan sales to affiliates amounting to $1.6 billion. The
January loan sales reversed the $900 million loan purchase transac-
tions made with affiliates in December that were undertaken to augment
the loan base used for computing loan reserves for tax purposes.
The December-January average of loan sales was about $350 million, a
little more than half the average rate for the preceding six months.
As in December, security loans in January dropped sharply
and are now below their level prior to the October-November bulge
in these accounts. Loans to nonbank financial institutions also
showed a decline, while real estate and consumer loans continued to
advance at the moderate rates of other recent months.

In contrast to this general picture, business loans including
loans sold to affiliates increased in January at a considerably stronger
pace than established recently. The pace of increase for December and
January combined may be more indicative of underlying conditions.
In the past two months together, the rate of expansion in business
loans (adjusted for loan sales) averaged about 6 per cent, which is
slightly below the average rate of advance maintained in the second half
of last year.

III -4
Bank sources of funds. Daily average deposits at all member
banks together with their nondeposit sources of funds declined from
December to January at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of about
3 per cent. A sharp drop in time and savings deposits was primarily
responsible for this decline. Bank indebtedness to the Euro-dollar
market was also lower on average in January than in December. In
contrast, private demand deposit balances averaged significantly higher,
reflecting the holdover effects of the year-end bulge in these
balances.
Within the month of January, a large decline in time deposits
occurred in the first few days immediately following the year-end interest
crediting period, but the outflow of deposit balances continued at a
slower pace throughout the month. Private demand deposits also dis-
played a relatively steady downtrend throughout January, as balances,
sharply inflated in the last week of December, were worked down during
the month of January. However, the rate of decline was moderate
relative to the late December buildup. The money stock moved
similarly, dropping to below its year-end total by the end of January,
but still the daily average level was about 10 per cent higher in
January than in December.

2/ Preliminary estimate based on data through January 21.
An idea of the shifting composition of this year's January
decline in time and savings deposits can be obtained by examining

CD's declined much less than a year earlier at banks in New York and
Chicago continuing the moderate pace of other recent months. In
addition, the rundown in CD's outside New York and Chicago was also
considerably below last year's large decline. This year's smaller
attrition is partly attributable to a reduced level of outstandings.1970

However, it also appears that banks were more successful in January,
as they have been in other recent months, in getting domestic
depositors to renew their maturing certificates. The recent hike in
Regulation Q ceilings should serve to at least sustain this situation.
While the negotiable CD picture in January was much improved
over a year ago, the situation was entirely the reverse with regard to
developments in consumer-type deposits, with the decline this year of
$1.1 billion contrasting with a very small runoff a year ago. Time and
savings deposits also dropped sharply at country member banks in
January as a large reduction in passbook savings deposits--only slightly
smaller in magnitude than last year's substantial decline--considerably
exceeded a moderate advance in all other time deposits. Some modera-
tion in the outflow of consumer-type deposits can also be expected to
result from the recent increase in Regulation Q ceiling rates on these
deposits. However, the outflow of these deposits at large banks in
New York and Chicago during the week of January 28--the only banks for
which data are available--was as large as the average reduction recorded
earlier in the month.

The course of developments during January in bank borrowing
in the Euro-dollar market or through affiliates in the domestic
market moved counter to the deposit trends. Bank indebtedness to the
Euro-dollar market rose substantially during January--but not
sufficiently to offset the December decline recorded in these
borrowings. Commercial paper indebtedness of bank subsidiaries,
affiliates, and holding companies also advanced at a comparatively
sharp pace in January.January

Nonbank depositary intermediaries. Paralleling the experience
in July and October last year, deposit outflows at nonbank depositaries
in January apparently continued after the close of the reinvestment
period. The large volume of non-competitive Treasury bill tenders and
of individual purchasers of bonds suggests that the pull of market yields
was the major factor responsible for the continued retardation of deposit
growth at these institutions. Unfortunately, the available data pre-date
the late January change in interest rate ceilings applicable to these
deposits. However, whatever the longer-run effect of these higher
ceilings may be, it seems clear that there was a sizeable net outflow
from both savings banks and savings and loan associations during the
1/month of January,-

During January, savings and loan associations substituted advances
from the FHLB System, which increased contra-seasonally by about $600
million, for a sizeable portion of their deposit outflows. The Federal
Home Loan Bank System reserve or liquid assets available for advances
reached a recent low on January 23 of about $800 million, but by the
end of January had been replenished by proceeds from its January financing
2/to a more usual level of $1.1 billion.
For the fourth quarter of 1969, the growth in thrift institution
deposits on a seasonally adjusted basis was at little more than a one per
cent annual rate, continuing the downward trend that had persisted all
year.

Despite the substantial reduction in deposit growth in 1969,
however, savings and loan associations were able to maintain their year-
earlier pace of net mortgage acquisitions at slightly above $9 billion.
By far the most important factor contributing to this stability was
the $4 billion in FHLB System advances, which were actually as large
as the growth in S&L deposits. An additional factor contributing to
the maintenance of the pace of S&L mortgage acquisitions was also
attributable to FHLBB policy; in large part as a result of two successive
reductions in the required minimum of S&L liquid asset holdings, slightly
more than $1 billion was freed during the year for mortgage lending. A
note of interest is that despite an $18 billion net increase in S&L
mortgage holdings since the end of 1967, there has been virtually no
change in the volume of mortgage repayments, which are an important
source of funds for gross mortgage acquisitions. This development reflects
the large volume of assumptions of mortgages by buyers of existing
properties and the reduction in prepayments, which resulted from the
reduced availability and higher cost of mortgage credit.

Mortgage market. The maintenance of mortgage lending by the
thrift institutions, despite their reduced deposit growth, has, of
course, been reflected in the working down of their backlog of mortgage
commitments. The latest data available for all S&Ls and N.Y. State
mutual savings banks indicate that the combined seasonally adjusted
backlog of outstanding mortgage commitments declined in December for the
eighth consecutive month and is now at its lowest level in two years.

III -12
In January, discounts associated with FNMA forward purchase
commitments increased substantially in each of the first two auctions
conducted after the upward adjustment in the FHA and VA ceilings to
8-1/2 per cent. In the auction of January 19, had the bids been
accepted, the discount on 6-month commitments would have exceeded 7
points as the volume of bids received remained unusually high. However,
FNMA rejected all bids because it felt that they were for the most
part speculative and damaging to FNMA's effectiveness. In addition,
FNMA also introduced certain changes in its auction procedure aimed
at stabilizing bid prices. These changes limit bidding to originating
mortgagees who have previously obtained an agreement from FHA or VA
to underwrite the mortgage. In addition, FNMA has tentatively changed
from a weekly to a bi-weekly auction in order to allow bidders more
time to assess current market developments and to give them more
of an opportunity to solicit funds from outside FNMA. In the first
bi-weekly auction following the change in procedure (January 26), the
level of discounts fell somewhat as the implicit private market yield
declined for the first time in nearly three months. One reason for
the decline in yields was the fact that FNMA accepted a much greater
proportion of bids than in the two preceding auctions. However, once
an initial period of adjustment to the new auction rules takes place,
yields may be expected to rise again, unless market pressures ease.

Corporate security and municipal bond markets. Public offerings
of corporate bonds in January amounted to an estimated $1.6 billion the
largest volume since mid-1967. Some issues were shifted forward on the
calendar, and recent announcements suggest that offerings will remain
high during the first quarter. Paralleling the recent rise in new issue
bond yields, stock prices have declined quite sharply as corporate profit
reports for the fourth quarter became available. By the end of January,
the NYSE stock price index had declined almost to the levels of February
1967, while the Dow-Jones index of quality issues fell to the lowest
level in 7 years.

Despite the large volume of new bonds, yields on high-grade new
corporate bond issues declined 30 to 45 basis points from mid-December to
mid-January. The drop in yields apparently resulted from a low level of
dealer inventories at year-end, a seasonally large flows of reinvestment.
funds from institutions, and sustained support of the public bond market
by individuals withdrawing funds from financial intermediaries and the
stock market. However with institutional investors hesitant to pay the
higher prices, a mounting volume of new issues reversed the short-lived
decline in yields. Dealer inventories began to build, syndicates with
large unsold balances were terminated after mid-month with upward yield
adjustments of 11 to 26 basis points, and the announcement of a $1.6 billion
issue of AT&T debentures for the second quarter reduced market enthusiasm
further. All these factors produced substantial upward yield pressures
late in the month.

III -15
Although there was some decline in new stock offerings in
January, probably reflecting the decline in stock prices, gross new
corporate financing for the month is estimated to have been about $2.6
billion. Staff projections for the balance of the quarter assume that
low corporate liquidity, reduced cash flow, and limited availability
of bank credit will continue to result in a high pace of new issue
volume. February public bond issues are now estimated at about $1.3
billion. Underwriters report that stock issue volume will rise from
the January level, as a number of utilities seek to reduce their debt-
equity ratios. This quarter's stock total will also be swelled by a
$500 million rights offer by a major oil company in March. Taking
into account a probable downward drift in private placements, reflecting
prior decreases in insurance company commitments,-/ the staff estimates
that total corporate security offerings will be about $2.4 billion in
February and somewhat higher in March.

The anticipated monthly average of total security offerings for
the first quarter of 1970 is thus about $2.6 billion, as compared with a
$2.1 billion average for the first quarter of 1969. The expected rise
in corporate financing is particularly evident in the public bond
sector, where the estimated monthly average for the first three months of
this year is $1.4 billion, as compared with a $900 million average for the
first quarter of 1969. At this time, it appears that proposed financing
by industrial, mortgage and transportation firms will dominate early 1970
financing. It is estimated that for the first quarter of 1970 only about
45 per cent of the volume of public bonds will represent issues by
public utilities and communications firms, whereas these industries
accounted for about 70 per cent of the bond volume in the year 1969.
Long-term borrowing by state and local governments in January
was about $1.2 billion. Much of the difference between this and the
earlier staff estimate of $900 million is accounted for by a $177 million
New York City offering, the timing of which was uncertain when the last
Green Book was prepared. Furthermore, the decline in the tax-exempt
yields, which continued through mid-month, facilitated the reoffering
of previously postponed issues. As in the case of the corporate bond
market, this early January decline in yields was fostered by a favorable
turn-of-the-year dealer inventory situation and a relatively high propor-
tion of high-grade, shorter-term issues. The volume of municipal issues
was also rather light for the first two weeks of the month. More
recently, however, a heavy calendar and concentration of buying interest

III -17
on shorter maturities have caused a reversal of earlier optimism and
municipal yields have risen 25 basis points from the low. At the end
of January the Bond Buyer index was only 12 basis points below its
December 1969 peak.

Because of the ever-growing backlog of displacements and the
steady build-up in the forward calendar, the staff estimates that February
and March volume will decrease only slightly, if at all,- In addition
to the raising of interest rate ceilings by several large borrowers in
late 1969, legislation to relax rate limitationsis now under consideration
in a number of other areas.

Government securities market. Further news of weakening in the
economy and an easing of year-end pressures moved yields on Treasury
coupon issues lower on average over the first three weeks of January;
but the cumulative effect of large Agency borrowing and the increasing
corporate calendar gave rise to a good deal of uncertainty and caution
in the market just prior to the Treasury's refunding announcement. As
a result by the last week in January, yields had retraced a large part
of their earlier declines. At the beginning of February, however, an
abrupt shift in market psychology toward expectations of a less restrictive
monetary policy turned yields down once again. Treasury bill rates followed
much the same pattern as coupon issues in January, declining until just
after mid-month, rising thereafter to month end, and then moving sharply
lower. On longer bill issues, for which non-competitive bidding in the
regular auctions has been extraordinarily heavy, the late January rise in
rates was somewhat less pronounced, and the recent decline sharper than for
short bills.

Dealer financing costs, which have continued to average around
9-1/2 per cent in New York, remain a strong influence in maintaining the
general level of bill rates and coupon yields, despite the fact that
dealer financing needs over the last three weeks have averaged somewhat
less than in late December and early January. Of more immediate influence
in the coupon market--in addition to the factors mentioned above--have
been the market's preparations for the Treasury's February refunding
operation. As shown in the table on dealer positions, the professional
portion of the market had built up its short coupon holdings while
depleting positions in both 1-5 year and over 5-year categories. Dealers

III -20
were thus in a good technical position for the financing. There was,
however, a good deal of uncertainty about the extent to which banks
would participate in the refunding as well as about the reception
that might be accorded any long option. In these circumstances, the
Treasury decided to offer a 3-option "rights" exchange: an 18-month
issue at 8-1/4 per cent; a 39-month note at 8-1/8 per cent; and a 7-year
issue at 8 per cent. All three issues appear to have been favorably
received and have moved to substantial premiums on a "when-issued"
basis.

Bill rates have moved in a fairly narrow range since the
January meeting of the Committee as dealers have shown little interest
in adding to positions and have thus remained as sensitive as earlier
to shifts in supply or demand conditions. The Board's action to increase
Regulation Q ceilings had virtually no effect on the bill market. It
is likely that some bill demand may be forthcoming in connection with
demands from investors choosing not to exchange their maturing issues
in the Treasury refunding. While these demands may account for some of
the latest sharp decline in bill rates, they have not yet been a major
factor in the market, and the recent improvement in bill rates is more
the result of the market's generally increased optimism about a
relaxation of monetary policy.
As shown in the table on average weekly market yields, there
have been only minor net changes in yields on outstanding Federal agency
securities, despite quite heavy new issue activity. Agencies have
offered a total of $3.3 billion in new issues, of which $1.4 billion
represented new money. For the most part these issues have been well
received by the market.

Other short-term credit markets. Yields on private money market
instruments decreased sharply in January. Commercial paper rates declined
75 basis points to 8.50 per cent and 1-month finance paper rates also fell
by the same amount to 8.25 per cent. Bankers' acceptance rates declined
50 basis points to 8.50 per cent. These declines more than reversed the
run up in yields during December in these markets, and by the end of
January more normal yield spreads prevailed between these instruments and
Treasury bills where yields rose in the second half of the month. There
are indications that the drop in bill yields over the first few days
in February has carried through to finance company and commercial paper
rates.

December, was at least partly seasonal. Because many corporate
investors are unwilling to position commercial paper on December 31,
yields over the year-end are bid up and the volume of paper outstanding
generally declines. During December, the volume of dealer- and directly-
placed paper declined on a seasonally unadjusted basis by about 5-1/2
per cent. After seasonal adjustment, however, such paper showed a
December increase of $935 million, or 3 per cent.
Commercial paper issued by bank affiliates and holding companies
grew by only $130 million in December. But through the first three
weeks in January it rose by an unusually large $925 million, in part
reflecting a reversal of the reduced rate of issuance in December but
also possibly facilitated by the more receptive short-term market.
The various proposed Federal Reserve regulations on bank-related
commercial paper were again postponed, to February 26.

Federal finance. The Administration's new Budget projects small
unified budget surpluses in the current fiscal year and in Fiscal 1971,
are as follows:

Growth of Federal outlays is expected to slow sharply in fiscal
1971 to an increase of $2.9 billion (compared to increases of $5.8 billion
and $13.3 billion in fiscal 1969 and 1970, respectively) despite an
expected $6.8 billion increase in outlays for social security and public
assistance. To achieve this small net increase in outlays the Administra-
tion plans, among other things, a $5.8 and $.5 billion cut in the defense
and space programs, respectively, as well as $2.2 billion reduction in
net lending and a $.9 billion reduction in net outlays for the Post
Office.

As indicated in the table some of the Administration's new
proposals, such as the family assistance and revenue sharing programs,
are scheduled to be introduced only on a modest scale in fiscal 1971,
and thus their major impact will be delayed until after that. The Budget
also calls for the Federal pay increase to be deferred six months beyond
the present schedule, that is, until January 1971.
The $197.9 billion estimate of outlays for the current fiscal
year is $5.0 billion above the level projected in the Summer Budget Review
and about $2.2 billion above the estimated level of the Congressionally
imposed ceiling on outlays. The President requested a change in the
ceiling in his budget message.Year

The $5 billion upward revision in current year outlays is chiefly
accounted for by increased payments for social security programs, higher
interest costs, and a postponement until the next fiscal year of planned
sales of financial assets, such as Farmers' Home Administration loans.
Total tax receipts in the budget message are expected to increase
$11.6 billion in the current fiscal year and by $2.7 billion in fiscal
1971. The lower increase in receipts in fiscal 1971 results from the
expiration of the surtax and the recent enactment of the Tax Reform
Act of 1969--a total reduction of $9.6 billion from fiscal 1970 levels--
and from reduced economic expansion. Partially offsetting the effect
of tax rate reductions and lessened growth are (1) a planned Administra-
tion action to speed up the collection of excise taxes and withheld
income taxes, yielding a one-time $1.2 billion increase in fiscal 1971
and (2) several new legislative proposals to increase tax receipts
by a total of $1.6 billion, which are listed in the following table.

The Administration's economic assumptions underlying the new
Budget include a $53 billion increase in GNP to a level of $985 billion
in calendar 1970 and a decrease in corporate profits from $94.3 billion
in calendar 1969 to $89.0 billion in calendar 1970. Personal income
is estimated at $800 billion in calendar 1970, an increase of 7 per cent
for the year.
The Board's staff currently is using lower projections for
these 1970 magnitudes: $977 billion for GNP, $85 billion for corporate
profits and $793 billion for personal income. Partly as a result of
these lower income assumptions and partly due to a slightly lower pro-
jection of effective tax rates, the staff's forecast of Federal budget
receipts in the current fiscal year is about $2.4 billion lower than the
Administration's (as shown in the Budget table at the end of this section).
Because of its lower estimate of receipts, the staff continues to forecast
a small budget deficit ($.9 billion) in the current fiscal year, even after
taking into account that in the month of January Treasury receipts--
apparently in the form of withheld taxes--were about $1.2 billion above the
level projected in the last Greenbook.
Turning to the Federal Sector in the National Income Accounts,
the Budget forecasts a NIA surplus of $3,6 billion in fiscal 1970 and
$1.6 billion in fiscal 1971. Due to its lower estimate of private
income and, hence, tax receipts, the Board staff is presently projecting
a smaller surplus--$2.0 billion--for the current fiscal year, as shown
in the budget table at the end of this section. For calendar 1970 the
Staff expects a $4.6 billion deficit in the national income accounts
budget, a $14.2 billion shift from the previous calendar year, which is

III -29
due in part to the assumed slowdown in economic growth. The slowdown
in economic activity is reflected more quickly in the Federal Sector
of the NIA accounts than in the unified budget, because of the
practice of accrual accounting for corporate taxes in the NIA accounts,
With respect to the current situation, the Treasury cash balance
at the end of January was $6.4 billion and will probably decline to
$5.4 billion by the end of February. By late February or early March,
the Treasury will need to raise additional new cash--according to Board
staff estimates--of $2.0 to $2.5 billion. A further cash financing
operation of about the same size--and the last one for the fiscal year--
will probably be needed by early April to offset the seasonal decline
in the Treasury balance that occurs just prior to the heavy April inflow
of income taxes payments.
NOTE: The budget document also indicates a continued high level of
activity by the five government-sponsored agencies that are
not included in the Budget proper, FNMA, FHLB and three Farm
Credit Administration enterprises. Their net borrowing is
estimated to be nearly $11.0 billion in fiscal 1970 and $7.7
billion in fiscal 1971, as compared to $4.0 billion in fiscal
1969.

THE ECONOMIC PICTURE IN DETAIL
International Developments
Balance of payments. Last year ended with a tremendous
return flow to the United States of funds that had been attracted
abroad earlier in the year by higher interest rates and an oppor-
tunity to profit from a revaluation of the German mark. The
result, well known by now, was a surplus in the liquidity balance
in the fourth quarter. This amounted to $1.4 billion (seasonally
adjusted), according to preliminary figures and the deficit for the
year was held down to $6.7 billion. Most of the year-end activity is
attributed to corporate investors who were required to comply with
controls limiting both their direct investments in foreign affiliates
and their holdings of liquid funds abroad, but actual data on such
flows will not be available for a month or more.
The data now available for several other major types of
transactions present a rather mixed picture of tendencies in the
balance of payments. The trade surplus rose strongly to $1.7 billion
(annual rate) in the fourth quarter of last year, as detailed below,
responding to cyclical developments here and abroad. Another favorable
development was a reduction in the outflow of U.S. capital to pur-
chase foreign securities; net outflows of this type in the fourth
quarcer were about $50 million (seasonally adjusted), compared to
an average of over $400 million in the first three quarters. On the

IV -2
other hand, foreign purchases of U.S. corporate stocks were apparently
only about $10 million in December; such purchases had held up well
in October and November, so that the fourth quarter total was about
$470 million. There were net liquidations in the summer during the
speculation on a mark revaluation. The poor performance of the U.S.
stock market, the enhanced attraction of stronger equity markets
elsewhere, and continued high yields on Euro-dollar and other alter-
native investment assets help to explain the recent shrinkage of this
inflow. For the year as a whole the inflow was nearly $1-1/2 billion,
less than in 1963 but far higher than in any earlier year.
An unexpected development at yearend was an outflow of
credit in December reported by U.S. banks amounting to over $1/2
billion (not seasonally adjusted). For the fourth quarter as a whole
the outflow (seasonally adjusted) was about $350 million. The year-
end surge appears to have included sizable drawdowns on credit lines
by Japan and some Latin American countries, a sizable outflow to
Canada, and some very short-term overdrafts that were probably repaid
early in January. A large part of the outflow reflected foreign
collections and other claims held for account of banks' customers,
rather than credits by the banks themselves. In fact, the entire
increase for the year 1969 in these bank-reported claims on foreigners,
which amounted to $560 million, was accounted for by types of claims
not subject to the Federal Reserve voluntary credit restraint program.
However, banks increased certain other foreign investments subject to
these guidelines but not reported on Treasury's Foreign Exchange forms.

IV -3
As 1970 began, the balance of payments was dominated
by the backwash of some of the extraordinary year-end flows.
Weekly data for the January 1-20 period show a liquidity deficit
of $1.3 billion. In that period the deficit was worsened to the
extent of about $500 million as the Treasury redeemed mark-denominated
Treasury notes issues under the military offset agreement with
Germany. Before that "special" transaction, and with a rough
seasonal adjustment, the liquidity deficit for the period would be
about $1.5 billion.
On January 1, the U.S. received the first allocation of
SDR's, amounting to $367 million; this addition to reserve assets is
not taken into account in this deficit figure for the monch.
A though the Januarh liquidity deficit as suggested by these
early figures was apparently extremely large (last year the January
deficit with comparable adjustments was about $700 million), it should
be regarded as partly offsetting the large December surplus rather
than indicating any major change from an underlying situation of
substantial deficit.
The balance as measured by official settlements did not gyrace
quite so widely at yearend as the liquidity balance, but it shifted
nevertheless from a surplus of $1.1 billion in December 1969 to a
deficit of $0.5 billion in the January 1-20 period (not seasonally
adjusted, and before taking account of the SDR allocation on January 1).
This balance was not affected by the redemption of nonliquid Treasury
issues in January. As in the case of the liquidity balance, the

IV -4
month-to-month swing was dominated by flows of corporate funds, but
it was damped by the accompanying change in U.S. banks' Euro-dollar
borrowings. After a $1.6 billion reduction in December, the liquid
liabilities of U.S. banks to foreign banks increased by $0.7 billion
in the January 1-28 period. Most of the change in liabilities to
foreign banks relates to accounts of U.S. banks with their own foreign
branches.
U.S. foreign trade. In December the export surplus rose
sharply as imports fell steeply while exports declined only moderately.
For the fourth quarter the export surplus was at an annual rate of
$1.7 billion (balance of payments basis), much improved from the
$1.3 billion of the third quarter and the small deficit recorded in
the first half of 1969. For the year 1969, the balance was only a
little over $1/2 billion, about the same as in 1968. In both years
the surplus was reduced to the extent of perhaps $1/2 billion by the
effects of strikes.
Much of the recent strength in exports stemmed from larger
shipments of agricultural commodities -- soybeans, corn and tobacco --
as foreign buyers shifted to the United States as supplies from other
sources were becoming more limited. Increased deliveries of commercial
aircraft also boosted exports in the fourth quarter, while shipments
of automotive equipment to Canada fell sharply.
Despite the rise in foreign orders for machinery throughout
1969, exports of such equipment have had virtually no growth since

IV 5
August. There is some indication that delivery times for these exports
have lengthened, perhaps as a result of the continued strength in
domestic demand for producers' equipment, so that export gains have
been delayed.
While monthly imports have fluctuated considerably, the
December drop suggests that imports are starting to respond to the
weakening of domestic demand. The ratio of imports to GNP in the
fourth quarter was still very high at 3.94 per cent but about the
same as in the third quarter. Supply stringencies abroad may also be
tending to reduce the imports of some industrial materials, such as
steel, as well as those of capital equipment. The value of imports
in the fourth quarter was buoyed by higher prices -- for coffee and
metals particularly -- as well as by renewed stockbuilding of coffee
in anticipation of further price rises resulting from frost damage to
the Brazilian coffee crop.
Exports in the fourth quarter of 1969 were $39.2 billion
at an annual rate (balance of payments basis), about 2.5 per cent
higher than in the third quarter. Agricultural commodities accounted
for 40 per cent of the increase but there was a downward drift in
their monthly values within the quarter. In addition to higher
deliveries of commercial aircraft, which were about 20 per cent
greater in the fourth quarter, coal, steel and chemicals accounted
for the expansion in nonagricultural exports. Exports of machinery
were unchanged from the third quarter level, as were those of consumer
goods. Shipments of electrical machinery fell much more sharply than

IV -6
those of nonelectrical machinery between October and December; the
G.E. strike may possibly have been a factor.
By areas, exports to Western Europe, Japan and Australia
and New Zealand showed the greatest expansion from the third to the
fourth quarter. Exports to Latin America increased slightly while
shipments to other developing countries fell. Deliveries of automotive
equipment to Canada were also lower as car output there was cut back,
paralleling cuts at U.S. plants. Shipments of other products to
Canada rose as output there turned up with the ending of the steel,
iron ore and nickel strikes.
Most of the increase in exports to Continental Western
European countries was in nonagricultural commodities while the rise
in exports to the United Kingdom and Japan was about equally
distributed between agricultural and nonagricultural commodities.
Imports in the fourth quarter were at an annual rate of
$37.5 billion (balance of payments basis), about 1.5 per cent higher
than in the third quarter. Preliminary unit-value indexes for
October-November (a rough proxy for prices) indicate an acceleration
in the prices of imported products -- particularly for coffee and
metals, but also for finished manufactures.
Imports of foodstuffs rose in the fourth quarter, reflecting
increased prices and stocks of coffee, and greater arrivals of sugar.
The value of imports of durable industrial materials was also higher,
because of higher prices for copper and nickel and greater quantities

IV -7
of iron ore. Imports of petroleum increased, but purchases of
materials associated with nondurable manufacturing -- textiles,
chemicals -- dropped as domestic output of these products leveled
off.
Imports of machinery and of nonfood consumer goods (other
than automobiles) declined from the third to the fourth quarter and
represented a smaller share of total domestic expenditures on these
products than in the third quarter. The drop in imports of consumer
goods is associated with the slackening in domestic demand for TV and
household appliances, and other durable consumer goods. In view of
the continued expansion in investment outlays both here and abroad,
the slowdown in arrivals of foreign machinery may result from
difficulties of foreign producers in meeting delivery schedules.
Although imports of cars from Europe and Japan declined from
the third to the fourth quarter, sales of these cars in the United
States increased in the fourth quarter. As a result, the customary
seasonal buildup in stocks was less than usual. Sales of foreign
(non-Canadian) cars accounted for about 12 per cent of total car
sales in the United States in the fourth quarter. For calendar 1969,
sales of these cars were 8.5 per cent greater than in 1968, and their
share of the U.S. market rose to over 11 per cent from 10 per cent in
1968. Increasing popularity of compacts may help to explain the con-
tinued strength in sales of foreign cars. In December 1969 compact
cars accounted for 13.5 per cent of all U.S. sales compared with 8.5
per cent in early 1969.

IV -8
Foreign exchange markets. Foreign exchange trading was
active during the latter half of January following the lull after
the turn of the year. Stronger demand for sterling developed about
mid-month, and the Canadian dollar came under buying pressure late
in January. The French franc exchange rate pushed higher during
the month,enabling the Bank of France to purchase a substantial
amount of dollars. The Italian lira, on the other hand, was under
selling pressure throughout the month.
The strong demand for sterling -- which pushed the pound's
exchange rate to its highest level in almost two years -- included
in large part seasonal oil company demand for that currency for
royalty payments. In addition, some of the increased demand for
sterling may have been triggered by the elevation of Regulation Q
ceilings, which seem to have been generally interpreted in the
exchange market as taking some of the pressure off the Euro-dollar
market and hence reducing potential Euro-dollar competitiveness
with sterling investments. Early in February heavy buying of sterling
developed in anticipation of the announcement of January reserve gains.
The Bank of England announced that its reserves, including
a $410 million allocation of SDR's, increased $50 million during
January, after 'xceptionally heavy debt repayments." The Bank of
England's receipts from market intervention totaled about $550 million
in January. It made debt repayments in the month of about $900 million,

IV -9
including $300 million on its System swap debt, reducing the swap debt to
the Federal Reserve to $350 million.
Increased demand for the Canadian dollar -- which caused the
Bank of Canada to purchase $75 million during the last week of January
as the Canadian dollar rate rose to its upper limit -- appeared to be
the result of some recent moderation in short-term capital outflows.
The Canadian basic balance of payments has been quite strong for more
than a year but there have been large short-term capital outflows, mainly
to the U.S. Late in January the Bank of Canada took measures to stop up
loopholes in its "swapped deposit" ceilings on commercial banks, which
are intended to check the outflows.
The Bank of Italy's reserves declined about $375 million during
January, roughly half representing market losses and half payments by
the Italian Government to the Common Market Agricultural Fund. The
weakness in the lira reflects in part continued large outflows of
capital, mainly through bank note export, reflecting in part political
uncertainties. Growing demand for the French franc, on the other hand,
enabled the Bank of France to purchase about $150 million in the market
during January, we roughly estimate. The National Bank of Belgium also
made dollar purchases amounting to $60 million. Demand for the German
mark was generally firm, reflecting in part tight financial market
conditions in Germany: the mark rate held above its lower limit except
for a day or two early in the month when the Bundesbank sold about

IV -10
$130 million. The Bundesbank's cash position was strengthened during the
month by redemption ahead of maturity of DM 2 billion of medium-term
U.S. Treasury notes and by the repayment of short-term credits it had
earlier made available to other European central banks.
The Euro-dollar market. Euro-dollar rates declined more than
seasonally during January, and by the first few days of February had
reached their lowest level since late October. The one-month rate
averaged about 9-3/8 per cent in the statement week ended February 4,
down from 10-3/8 per cent in the first week of January.

One factor tending to produce lower rates was the reduced
demand for Euro-dollars on the part of U.S. banks. Liabilities of all
U.S. banks to their foreign branches stood at $13,837 million on
January 28, up $850 million since year-end, but some $750 million lower

IV -11
than at mid-December. New York commercial banks, which raised large
amounts of funds in January through commercial paper issued by their
holding companies, by the end of January reduced their liabilities to
their foreign branches even below year-end levels. Some of the early
January increase in liabilities to branches no doubt represented the
reversal of transactions undertaken prior to yearend, i.e., the
shifting of deposits back to branches from head office accounts, and
the repurchase of loans previously sold to the branches by head offices.
Such transactions have little effect on conditions in the market.
On the supply side, the Bank of Italy suffered a large reserve
loss during January through exchange market intervention -- estimated
at about $200 million -- and although this loss mostly reflected the
movement of bank notes to Switzerland, some of these funds may have
found their way into the Euro-dollar market. On the other hand, German
commercial banks did not rebuild their net foreign asset positions
during January by nearly as much as they drew them down in December.
Furthermore, large reserve gains by the Bank of England and the Bank
of France reflected movements of private funds that may have tended to
reduce the supply of funds to the Euro-dollar market.

IV -12
GNP in major industrial nations. Capital investment and exports
were the primary sources of growth of output in the major European
countries, and in Canada and Japan in 1969. In 1970, expansion of these
GNP components will be slower and, in general, the rate of growth of GNP
seems bound to slow down.
In Europe, growth was most rapid in Germany, where demand
pressures steadily intensified. After a brief weakening of the boom
early in 1959 the Japanese economy resumed a vigorous upward trend. In
France and Canada growth was rapid during the first part of the year, but
restraint measures applied by the authorities helped to slow expansion of
demand in the second half; some production was also lost through strikes
in those countries. Strikes sharply reduced second-half growth in Italy.
In the United Kingdom, the economy was flat through the first half of the
year but economic activity turned up in the second half.
In Germany, France and Italy, concern over inflation and--in
France and Italy--over Balance of payments deficits led the authorities
to apply restrictive measures last year. However, in Germany these measures
are not expected to take full effect before the second half of 1970.
In France, expansion should slow down again in 1970; but in Italy the
economy will probably continue to expand rapidly, with output close to
full capacity throughout 1970, In Japan, restrictive action was taken
starting in September, and the expectation is that growth--though still
vigorous--will slacken throughout 1970.

In the United Kingdom, no further significant moves in the
direction of restraint have been taken since the budget last April. With
the balance of payments substantially improved--large surpluses are now
being recorded--and with the government required to call an election no
later than the spring of 1971, some easing of restraints seems likely this
year. Thus the expansion of demand begun in the third quarter is likely
to continue in 1970, very possibly at an accelerated rate.
In Canada, growth is apt to Le held to very moderate levels
throughout the year, with perhaps a slight pickup in the second half as
a result of the projected slackening in aggregate demand in the United States
and the broad array of stalilization measures adopted last year.

IV -14
Germany's expansion, moving from an export-led investment phase
towards a consumption boom, resulted in real GNP rising by 8.1 per cent
from the second half of 1968 to the second half of 1969, compared to
0.7 per cent in the same 1967-68 period. Through 1969 the rate of expansion
showed no appreciable signs of flagging, despite government efforts to
keep total demand within tolerable bounds.
Growth in 1973 is expected to slow down, with the projected
increase for the second half of 1970 over the second half of 1969 about
3.3 per cent. Within the year, growth should remain quite brisk during
the first half as the economy continues to meet the still very substantial
backlog of orders, domestic and foreign. By the second half of the year,
however, it is anticipated that the combined effects of revaluation and
deflationary fiscal and monetary policies will be reflected in a decelerated
rate of growth. In particular, investment growth may taper off--if cost
increases erode profit margins, credit becomes less easily available and
pressures on productive capacity diminish--and demand for exports should
be softer as the price effects of revaluation make themselves felt.
One sector of demand the growth of which is not expected to
decline is consumption, largely because of liberal wage settlements
concluded and anticipated. The government is encouraging arrangements
to mitigate the inflationary effects of the large pay boosts primarily
through employer contributions to a capital--or investment--fund, thus
deferring the increase in disposable incomes. A recently concluded wage
agreement between the government and a union representing 1.2 million
public service workers included such a provision.

IV -15
German financial markets have tightened considerably as the
Bundesbank has acted to offset only a small part of the liquidity drain
caused by the outflow of capital in the wake of the revaluation last
October. It now seems unlikely that the monetary authorities will put
additional upward pressure on Germany's already very high short-term
interest rates. Until recently the Bundesbank Council had been considering
an increase in the discount rate, which is unusually far below money market
rates at present. However, the recent steps to increase the restrictive-
ness of fiscal policy make such a move a good deal less likely.
Fiscal policy is to be tightened this year through the blocking
of some originally planned government expenditures and the sterilization
of some public revenues. This type of budgetary action has the advantage
of flexiility and, if the slowdown in the second half becomes too
pronounced--as some German experts fear--the sterlized funds could be
quickly released.
In France, real GDP was 4.2 per cent higher in the second half
of 1969 than in the same period in 1968. Within 1969, growth in real
output in the first half year was at an annual rate of about 5 per cent
but slowed to a little less than 4 per cent in the second half. Growth
factors last year were a very rapid expansion in fixed investment, an
inventory build-up in the first half, and, in the last third of the year,
a steep rise in exports, partially in response to the devaluation of the
franc in August. In addition, consumer demand intensified in the months
before devaluation in the expectation of devaluation, associated price
inflation, and restrictive consumer credit measures.

IV -16
The gradual deceleration of growth of output in 1969 resulted
from both the intensification of restraint measures applied by the
authorities to check inflation and eliminate the balance of payments
deficit, and the effects of a large number of strikes in the second half.
During the summer, labor and material shortages held back expansion.
Thereafter, monetary policy, tightened in the first half of 1969, was
made even more stringent following the devaluation in early August.
Further expansion of short-term bank credit until mid-1970 was prohibited,
and strict limits were placed on the permissible expansion of medium- and
long-term credit. Fiscal policy was made more restrictive in the govern-
ment's stabilization plan announced in September, with a plan to eliminate
the budget deficit in 1970 and with the abolition of tax incentives for
investment. Installment buying regulations were severely tightened.
(They were slightly relaxed, however, in early February.)
Despite all these restraint measures, growth is likely to
continue to be relatively rapid in at least the first half of this year
because of the overhang of past orders. In the second half, however,
growth should slow down as orders are unbound and as the effects of
the restrictive actions taken last year intensify.
In Italy, real GNP, after growing at an annual rate of almost
8 per cent in the first half of 1969, barely increased at all in the
second half as output was sharply reduced by strikes in manufacturing
industries and construction in September-December. The strikes were

IV -17
reflected in a substantial decline in inventories and a slowdown in
the rate of increase of personal consumption owing to loss of wages
by those on strike.
The Italian economy will be subject to severe demand pressures
in 1970. The wage settlements concluded at the end of last year, providing
for increases of 13 to 14 per cent in 1970 in such key industries as
metals, engineering, chemicals and construction, are expected to boost
consumption sharply. In addition, capital investment is also expected
to contribute heavily to economic expansion.
Real GNP in the first half may increase by as much as
15 per cent (annual rate), a figure that reflects a return to full
production after the strikes. The depletion of inventories in 1959 should
Le made up for in the first half of this year. In the second half, the
annual rate of expansion may be about 7 per cent, which will probably
press on capacity limitations. The rise in prices will probably accelerate
in the second half despite some slowing of investment and a deterioration
of the foreign balance.
The increase in aggregate demand this year is likely to exceed
what the Italian authorities consider desirable. Treasury Minister Colombo
has warned that inflationary pressures will make 1970 a "difficult year."
However, the authorities are not expected to intensify restraints on
the economy to slow the rate of expansion. While an attempt will be
made to keep the budget deficit from increasing, it is unlikely that
action will be taken to reduce it. Political considerations may make it

IV -18
difficult for monetary policy, progressively tightened since May, to be
made more stringent. Bond yields rose about 60 basis points between May
and November and substantially further in the past two months. Increases
in short-term interest rates occurred last summer.
After registering no increase from the second half of 1968 to
the first half of 1969, British gross domestic product--in real terms--
resumed growth in the second half of last year. The first to second
half increase appears to have been about 2.5 per cent, or slightly more,
at an annual rate. Consequently, GDP in 1969 was somewhat less than
2 per cent greater then in 1968.
Major contributors to the second half recovery were exports,
which advanced sharply in the third quarter before leveling off in the
fourth, and fixed capital formation, which rebounded from its first half
decline largely because of a marked upturn in manufacturing investment.
Consumer spending rose in the second half. Depressing factors were home-
building and inventory accumulation, both hampered by the government's
tight money policy. Government consumption appears to have grown at
about the same rate as overall GDP,
The outlook for 1970 is for continued growth of real GDP at
a rate of perhaps 3 per cent--or slightly faster than in the second half
of last year. Recent surveys of investment intentions suggest that
manufacturing investment will be the prime growth stimulant in 1970, with
an increase of about 10 per cent from 1969 to 1970 now indicated.
Continuation of monetary stringency could produce cutbacks of currently

IV -19
ambitious plans, though manufacturing investment does not appear to
have been inhibited by tight money in the second half last year.
Investment surveys do not point to a comparable surge in
investment in the distributive, service and shipping industries, where
the increase will probably be somewhat less than 3 per cent. Some
revival in homebuilding is expected, though again the rate of increase
is apt to be small. The same appears true of government consumption.
The slowdown in world trade and capacity limitations in key
export sectors in the United Kingdom may slow the rate of increase in
British exports, but an increase in real terms of at least 5 per cent
this year seems likely.
With wages rising at least 6 to 7 per cent a year--and perhaps
faster, given the virtual abandonment of incomes policy and the pattern
of large wage increases that was emerging at the end of last year--
disposable income and consumption seem certain to rise by at least
3 per cent in real terms in 1970. In fact, a rise in real consumption
considerably in excess of 3 per cent seems more than a remote possibility,
since the government--faced with an election no later than May next
year--will probably ease its restrictive policies to benefit the consumer.
The government may well lower indirect taxes and ease installment buying
regulations in the near future.
A 3 per cent rate of growth in GDP would appear compatible with
maintenance of a sizable balance of payments surplus. If, however, a
surge in consumer spending pushes the rate of increase substantially over
3 per cent, Britain's balance of payments position might deteriorate.

IV -20
Real GNP in Canada grew at an annual rate of almost 6 per cent
during the first half of 1969 but then slowed to an annual rate of just
over 1 per cent in the second half. The decleration in the second half
reflected both the adoption of stabilization measures by the government
and output lost because of strikes in such important industries as nickel
and steel. The principal sources of stimulus to growth in 1969 were
investment and exports.
With the likelihood of slow growth in the United States, and
with domestic policies aimed at a further easing of demand pressures,
growth in real GNP this year is expected to be low. The Canadian economy
may expand at perhaps a 1.5 per cent annual rate in the first half and at
a 2 per cent annual rate in the second. In their battle against rising
prices, the Canadian authorities have used a variety of measures, including
a relatively tight fiscal policy, a very tight money policy--the money
supply has not grown for the last six months--an acceleration of Kennedy
Round tariff cuts, promotion of a voluntary price and wage restraint
program, and threats of compulsory wage and price controls.
In Japan the increase in real GNP in the fiscal year ending
March 31, 1970 will be about 14 per cent. A slight slowdown in the fol-
lowing fiscal year is expected primarily because of an anticipated slowdown
in industrial investment. However, a rise in the growth rate of consumer
expenditures and increased government expenditures on social improvement
programs are expected to take up much of the slack.

IV -21
The main Japanese domestic economic issue is inflation.
Consumer prices rose by 6.5 per cent in 1969, a somewhat faster rate than
in 1964-68. The increase in 1970 is expected to be only slightly less
than in 1969.
Wholesale prices also rose rapidly in 1969--by 4.1 per cent,
the largest rise in a decade. The spread of inflation to wholesale prices
has raised fears in Japan about threats to Japanese competitiveness in
export markets (despite the fact that Japan is expected to achieve a
balance of payments surplus in the current fiscal year of $2.1 billion
and a comparable surplus next year).
Large wage increases in 1970-71 are expected to contribute
to inflation with Japanese workers reportedly demanding pay hikes of
18 to 20 per cent, well in excess of anticipated productivity gains.
The burden of curbing inflation has been placed on monetary
policy, which was tightened in September. The discount rate and reserve
ratios were raised and quantitative restrictions on bank lending were
imposed. Fiscal policy will be somewhat expansionary this year with
government expenditures expected to rise by 10 per cent primarily because
of commitments to various projects intended to meet urgent social needs.
The tighter money policy introduced in September is expected
to cause a slowdown in growth by the second quarter. Current forecasts
indicate the slowdown will continue in the second half, despite the
expansionary effects of consumer and government spending.

APPENDIX A: LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES DURING 1969*
During 1969, with intensification of the pressures that had
been apparent in 1968, the volume of funds the life insurance industry
was able to direct to the capital markets--and particularly to the
long-term debt markets--was reduced markedly. Continued restriction on
the total volume of funds available for investment was only one feature
of industry investment activity during the year. Other manifestations of
the market environment during 1969 included continued uncertainty regarding
the outlook for future fund flows and a corresponding attempt to maintain
flexibility in commitment scheduling, as well as further emphasis away
from fixed-income investments into equities or instruments with equity or
contingent-interest features.
Sources of funds
The volume of funds available during 1969 for investment in the
capital markets was constrained by a variety of forces, all of which were
related to the general economic and financial environment of the period.

Funds received from basic insurance operations (the net change
in ledger assets) were actually smaller than during either 1967 or 1968.
While insurance premium receipts have experienced some retardation in growth,
the actual shortfall in this source probably reflects the losses realized
on long-term securities sold during the year. Similarly, return flows from
existing investments have grown extremely slowly since 1968; while the
volume of maturing bonds has maintained its growth, this has been partially
offset by the continued decline (as at nonbank depositary institutions)
in the funds received from mortgage prepayments.
The industry had anticipated the kind of cash flow pressures that
materialized during the year, and had been prepared to adapt its investment
activity accordingly. Although the actual volume of policy loans had been
under-estimated by them, the modest new commitment activity carried out the
year earlier, as well as the degree of flexibility that had been incorporated
in scheduling of commitment disbursements vis-a-vis projected cash flow,
provided little need to employ extraordinary adjustments. Thus, although
sales of securities from long-term portfolio once again represented a
fairly important source of funds during 1969, their volume was little changed
from 1968.
The increase in policy loans, which during 1969 represented fully
17 per cent of funds invested elsewhere, was even larger than the recent
peak year of 1966, when policy loans accounted for 10 per cent of funds
otherwise invested. At the end of 1969, policy loans outstanding accounted
for 7 per cent of the total assets of all life insurance companies--equal
to their holdings of corporate common and preferred stock.
There has been some attempt to analyze the composition of policy
loans. According to results from a sample survey, more than half of the
volume outstanding at mid-1969 was in small amounts, and most loans had
been made for cash disbursement--i.e., not as payment for insurance premiums.
This confirms that these loans, granted at a contractually-guaranteed 5 per
cent interest rate, have been used either in lieu of other borrowing or for
direct investment by policyholders in the capital market.
New commitment activity
The industry apparently expects its cash flow to remain relatively
modest over the next several quarters at least. Although policy loans have
tended to abate somewhat from mid-summer peaks, volume nevertheless remains
high and is expected to continue so over the near term. Return flows from
existing investments, particularly mortgages, are also expected to remain
reduced. Projected total funds available for gross market investment there-

A-3
fore remain modest; scheduling of new investment acquisitions not only is
correspondingly low, but continues to afford leeway in the event that
projected fund flows prove to have been overestimated.

In addition to the reduced overall volume of new commitments
made, there has been a significant shift in the allocation of future funds
between corporate debt and mortgages. As shown in Table 3, the differential
between the contract interest rate on new mortgage commitments and direct
placements actually favored direct placements during 1969. (These average
rates do not allow for the generally higher costs of servicing mortgages,
which have been estimated at between 25 and 50 basis points higher than the
costs for direct placements.) Despite this apparent incentive, however,
there has been a far larger reduction in new commitments for corporate direct
placements than for mortgages.

p/ Preliminary.
Part of this apparent anomaly is accounted for by the industry's
'Billion Dollar Program" to invest in the inner city, commitments for which
are overwhelmingly in mortgages. However, the most telling reason for the
relative emphasis on mortgages is the potential income, in addition to the
fixed interest, that is available on income-property mortgages. Equity
features--such as contingent interest geared to a property's earnings, or
the life insurer's ownership of the land which is then leased to the mort-
gagor--have become increasingly common; about half of the volume of income
property mortgage commitments made during 1969 is estimated to have provided
such contingent interest features. In contrast, only a small--albeit
growing--portion of corporate direct placements offers such equity-type
participation; during 1969, about one-fourth of new direct placement
commitments carried either warrants to purchase common stock or convertible
features.

Acquisitions of investments
As a consequence of the shortfall in cash flow, as well as
reduced commitment activity since 1967, net acquisitions of corporate
debt were reduced by about 25 per cent from the year-earlier volume.
Mortgage acquisitions on income-producing properties were relatively
better maintained, but continuing a recent trend, the industry's holdings
of single-family home mortgages were reduced, net.
