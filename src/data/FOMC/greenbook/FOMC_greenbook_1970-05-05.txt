SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK
Nonfinancial
Recent economic data present a mixed picture of strengths
and weaknesses, but on the whole it appears that the decline in real
output of goods and services may be bottoming out.
Recent developments. Real GNP declined at an annual rate of
1.6 per cent in the first quarter, about as projected in the previous
Greenbook, but the implicit GNP deflator rose at a rate of 5.0 per cent--
more than had been expected. Industrial production appears to be off
only a little in April, following a small rise in March. Although
employment has been declining persistently in manufacturing, it has
continued to rise fairly strongly in nonmanufacturing. Consumer
spending turned out stronger than anticipated in the first quarter, and
retail sales of nondurable goods stores appear to be up in April;
however, sales of autos continued sluggish in the first 20 days of
the month.
The leading indicators as a group were little changed in
March. Among the individual indicators, housing starts increased
sharply, while new orders for durable goods declined. Stock prices
have fallen sharply in April, following a small March recovery.
Despite a continued decline in new orders for capital equipment and
the weak profits performance in the first quarter, the McGraw-Hill

I- 2
Survey, taken earlier this month and not yet released, shows a planned
increase of 9 per cent in business spending for plant and equipment
this year, as compared with 8 per cent shown last November.
While the increase with GNP deflator accelerated in the
first quarter, the rise in the consumer and wholesale industrial
price indexes slowed as the quarter progressed. In April, average
wholesale prices of all commodities edged down under the impetus of
lower prices of farm products and foods, although prices of industrial
commodities continued to rise at about a 3.5 per cent annual rate
Outlook. Given recent economic tendencies, and in view of
the current bulge in Federal expenditures, real GNP is expected to
change little in the second quarter, following two quarters of decline.
The retroactive Federal pay increase is adding about $5-1/2 billion
to personal income this quarter, and the retroactive increase in
social security benefits another $7 billion. Bolstered also by
income increases generated elsewhere in the economy, personal dis-
posable income is projected to show an exceptionally large increase
this quarter. We are expecting this upsurge to generate a somewhat
larger rise in consumer spending than in the first quarter, but we are
also expecting that a significant portion will be reflected in a
sharply higher saving rate.
State and local purchases are likely to increase moderately
further this quarter, and business fixed investment is projected to
continue to rise about in line with our preceding projection. We

I- 3
have revised upward our second quarter projection of residential
construction outlays, however, in response to the unexpected strength
of starts in February and March.
Looking further ahead, we have not changed materially our
projections for the second half of the year, apart from a modification
in the expected pattern of change in net exports. Expansion in real
GNP is now projected to average around 3-1/2 per cent. Inventory
accumulation is expected to increase moderately in the second half,
in contrast to the decline of the first half of the year. But, final
sales are projected to rise only a little more than in the first half
of the year. Housing starts and residential construction activity
are expected to turn up after mid-year, but we are projecting a
deceleration of the rise in business fixed investment. The total
for the year is up 8 per cent--close to the recent McGraw-Hill Survey.
Since projected real GNP growth continues below the potential of the
economy in the second half, available industrial and manpower resources
are in general expected to be ample. The manufacturing capacity
utilization rate, which averaged below 80 per cent in the first
quarter, is expected to decline somewhat further before leveling off
after midyear.
Employment and unemployment changes over the next few months
may reflect to some extent the impact of strike activity in trucking
and other important sectors. Aside from these effects, nonfarm
employment would likely continue to expand moderately, and the
unemployment rate would rise somewhat further.

I-4
We still expect a moderation of the rate of increase in the
GNP price deflator, perhaps to a 3.7 per cent annual rate in the
fourth quarter. The intervening price rise, however, may be somewhat
larger than estimated earlier, since the first quarter appeared to
reflect stronger price pressures than we had anticipated. The main
elements leading to our expectation of moderation from this point on
are about the same as we have noted in preceding Greenbooks. In
the important foods group--in contrast to the large increases of 1969--
retail prices may well ease somewhat in the second half of this year
in view of prospective increases in supplies of meats. More generally,
pressures on available resources should ease, and resumption of
moderate expansion in economic activity in the second half of the year
should result in an improved productivity performance. This should
serve to moderate upward cost and price pressure, even though wage
increases are likely to continue large.

I -5
Financial
Conditions in securities markets have weakened considerably
over recent weeks. Stock prices dropped sharply through their lows
of recent years, and interest rates in debt markets generally rose
from 3/8 to 5/8 of a percentage point. Yields on Treasury bills--
while still well below their 1969 highs--are again at levels that
make Regulation Q ceilings on bank CD's uncompetitive, and yields on
corporate and municipal bonds are now back to within 10-15 basis points
of their late 1969 highs.
The sharpness of these price and yield adjustments has
reflected changed market expectations arising from the anticipated
weakening of fiscal restraints, the developing view that the economy
may be somewhat stronger than anticipated, and the recent tightening
of money market conditions. In addition, a very heavy past and pros-
pective volume of new issues in long-term debt markets has also
contributed to upward pressures on bond yields. In short-term markets,
however, funds raised through business loans at banks and through
commercial and finance company paper appear to have tapered off,
partly as a result of corporate efforts to restructure debt positions.
Outlook for market borrowing. New offerings in the corporate
bond market are expected to continue unusually large through the
second quarter, with much of this anticipated supply already scheduled.
Utilities and industrial corporations will require a large volume of

I-6
funds to finance capital and current expenditures in a period of
declining profits and reduced liquidity. And some further restruc-
turing from short- to long-term debt can also be expected. A
continuing relatively large demand for funds is also anticipated in
the municipal bond market, but the volume of such issues actually
floated will depend importantly on whether banks are able to partici-
pate in the market to anything like the extent they did in March and
April.
While the volume of corporate long-term financing is
expected to be very heavy, growth in outstanding private short-term
credit may remain moderate, though rising somewhat from the unusually
slow pace of March and April. Reports from banks are mixed, with some
banks indicating continued strong business loan demands and others
noting a moderation of such demands. It should be noted, in this
respect, that the 8 per cent prime rate is becoming relatively more
attractive to borrowers in an environment of rising market rates.
In the market for Federal agency securities, the volume of
new cash offerings in April dropped off a bit from the very active
pace of earlier months and seems likely to remain on the more
moderate side so long as savings inflows to thrift institutions hold
up. As for Treasury offerings, terms on the May refunding will be
announced the afternoon of April 29. Assuming attrition of about $1
billion in the refinancing, it is expected that the Treasury will have

I- 7
to raise about $2 billion of new cash in late May or early June,
while continuing the cash additions to weekly and monthly bill auctions.
Outlook for mortgage markets. Deposit growth at the nonbank
thrift institutions apparently improved considerably in March and early
April. The savings and loan associations have used part of their
recent gains to repay outstanding borrowing and to rebuild depleted
liquidity. But with their liquidity improved and the recent liberi-
lization in FHLBB policies regarding advances, the S and L's are
likely to be encouraged to use a larger share of any future deposit
growth to support mortgage commitments and acquisitions. Prospects
for a continued relatively favorable net inflow of deposits to thrift
institutions are somewhat uncertain in view of the recent advances in
market interest rates, but, on balance, it seems to us likely that
net inflows in the second quarter will remain significantly above the
depressed pace of the past year.
Other mortgage lenders--commercial banks and life insurance
companies--may have neither the funds nor the inclination to step up
their commitments greatly in the house mortgage market. These
institutions, as well as pension funds and bank trust departments,
are being solicited by the Administration for informal agreements to
increase such commitments this year, but attractive yields on other
investments pose a countervailing incentive. Finally, it should be
noted that the combination of rising house and land prices and

I-8
sharply higher interest rates may be discouraging some prospective
home buyers, thereby reducing effective mortgage demands.
Interest rate prospects. Assuming moderate growth in money
and bank credit, it is likely that the pressure of credit demand in
long-term markets will keep bond yields fairly close to current
levels. Some downward rate movement cannot be discounted, however,
once the current Treasury and AT&T financings are out of the way
and particularly if emerging business and stock market developments
should cast doubt on current expectations of a stronger economy.
Some decline in short-term interest rates may be expected
for seasonal reasons in late spring. In addition, continued moderate
short-term credit demands, together with preferences for short-term
instruments on the part of investors--particularly those uncertain
about the stock market--would tend to take some of the recent pressure
off short-term rates. Nevertheless, it is by no means clear that
short-term rates will draw back to their late March lows if the rise
in dollar GNP is as large as projected, if demands for money for
transactions or precautionary purposes are strong, and if, at the
same time, growth in money stock is limited to quite moderate propor-
tions.

I -9
Balance of payments
The underlying deficit in U.S. external transactions appears
to have been running in the $4 billion to $5 billion a year range. This
is the indication given by the February and March data on official
settlements together with U.S. banks' borrowing abroad, after crude
adjustment for seasonality.
Exports dipped in March, after a high February; they appear
to be still on a trend of moderately strong increase. Imports held
near the February level. Much of the rise in imports since the fourth
quarter has been in purchases of consumer goods. There were further
increases in the prices paid for some imported materials and foodstuffs.
Last year's changes in the French and German currency parities
have faciliated marked gains in net reserves by Britain and France,
bringing large repayments of reserve debts by those countries. Italian
reserve drains have greatly diminished in the past two months. German
reserves fell very sharply for several months after the mark revaluation,
but recently they have increased a little, as the German trade surplus
has remained large and net capital outflows have diminished. Both
Canada and Japan had large reserve gains in the first quarter; Canada's
probably rested on temporary factors, but Japan's appears persistent.
Inflationary pressures are continuing strong in most
industrial countries. Central bank policies are accordingly maintain-
ing tight credit market conditions--even, in Britain's case, after two

I -10
half-point cuts in the Bank of England's discount rate. While this
environment is favorable for growth of U.S. exports, it is contributing
in some degree to upward pressures on prices in this country as else-
where, and it makes very unlikely a resumption of net capital inflows
to the United States on the 1968 or 1969 scale,
No marked change in net exports of goods and services is
looked for in coming months, and it seems reasonable to expect net
capital flows and the overall balance to continue near recent levels.
Interest rate relationships will probably continue to encourage re-
payment of Euro-dollar borrowings by U.S. banks. Continuing large
additions to foreign official reserves are probable, and are likely
to be less concentrated in Britain and France than in the recent
past.

THE ECONOMIC PICTURE IN DETAIL
Domestic Nonfinancial Scene
Gross national product. The preliminary Commerce Department
estimates for the first quarter show a somewhat larger rise in current
dollar GNP than we had estimated in our preceding projection, a larger
price increase, and about the same rate of decline in real GNP. These
first official figures show GNP up $8.2 billion last quarter, but in
real terms, output declined at an annual rate of 1.6 per cent. The
implicit GNP deflator rose at a 5 per cent annual rate, following a
4.5 per cent rate of increase in the fourth quarter. The greater
increase in current dollar GNP was mainly the result of an unanticipated
surge in nondurable goods sales. Expenditures in other sectors were
about as expected.
As indicated in our revised GNP projections in the supplement
to the last Greenbook, the outlook for GNP growth in the second quarter
was significantly strengthened by the enactment of the Federal pay raise
in April. Commerce has not yet reached a final decision on how the
retroactive portion of the pay raise will be handled in the national
income accounts, but we have assumed for the time being that the entire
pay increase, including the retroactive portion, will be incorporated

II -2
in the second quarter,figures adding some $4.6 billion to Federal
purchases and to GNP.1/ (In addition, the postal pay increase amount-
ing to $800 million, including the retroactive portion, is incorporated
in total Federal expenditures, NIA basis, and in personal income, but
is not included in Federal purchases or in GNP.) Information which has
become available in the past several weeks has suggested only a modest
change in the overall outlook, and we are now projecting an increase
of $15 billion in GNP for the second quarter instead of the $16 billion
rise presented in the last Greenbook supplement. Real GNP, however,
is about unchanged from the first quarter level.
Although similar in total, the projection differs in several
respects from that which we presented last time.

1/ One of several alternatives that is being considered is to include
the retroactive portion of the pay increase in Federal purchases for the
first quarter. If this procedure is adopted, current dollar GNP would
be raised by $2.3 billion in the first quarter and our second quarter
estimate would be reduced by that amount. Since all of the Federal pay
increase is considered to be a price increase, the pattern of change in
real GNP would not be affected but the implicit deflator would differ
from what is now shown. It should be stressed, however, that no
modification would be required in this account in the pattern now
shown for personal income.

II -3
Most significantly, residential construction activity now appears
unlikely to weaken as much as we had anticipated. Starts averaged
1.25 million in the first quarter, off by 100 thousand from the
fourth quarter average. But they showed greater strength in February
and March than anticipated. Although some further decline appears
probable in the next few months, demands are generally strong and
multi-family starts have been surprisingly well maintained. On the
assumption that funds must be somewhat more plentiful for such projects
than we had thought, we have adjusted up the projected level of total
starts in the second quarter by 170,000 units, to 1.2 million, annual
rate. As a result, residential construction outlays are now estimated
to drop by about $1 billion over the quarter instead of by the $3
billion indicated earlier.
On the other hand, net exports are now expected to be weaker
this quarter than in our former projection. Imports are running some-
what higher than we had thought likely in view of the weakening in
domestic demands. In addition, deliveries of new large jets to foreign
airlines are not expected to be quite as large as earlier assumed. As a
result, we are now projecting a decline of $700 million in net exports
of goods and services in the second quarter rather than a modest
increase.
Several other small adjustments have been made which tend to
reduce the projected size of the GNP increase in the second quarter.
Our estimate of Federal purchases has been reduced slightly, particularly

II -4
for nondefense. In addition, although it is too early to assess
accurately the apparently growing impact on production and employ-
ment of the teamster's strike and lockout and a strike in the
rubber industry, we have made some allowance for this by reducing
slightly the rate of growth of income and consumption for the
quarter.
Nevertheless, disposable personal income seems certain to
rise sharply as a result of the increase in Social Security benefits
and the Federal pay raise. Consumer spending, therefore, is expected
to continue up at a relatively brisk rate. But the increase is not
likely to keep pace with a disposable income figure buttressed by sub-
stantial retroactive payments and we are projecting a sharp rise in
the saving rate, from 6.5 per cent to 7.3 per cent.
There still has been no persuasive indication of significant
easing in capital spending. New orders for capital equipment were off
slightly in the first quarter, and preliminary returns from the NICB
survey indicate the possibility of a further downward adjustment last
quarter in manufacturing appropriations. On the other hand, confi-
dential returns from the April McGraw-Hill survey indicate that business-
men plan to increase capital outlays 9 per cent for 1970 as compared
with an 8 per cent increase reported last November. As a result, we
are basically holding with our former projection of a continued--but
moderating--rise in these outlays for the remainder of the year.

II -5
The outlook for most other sectors of demand after mid-year
also remains essentially the same as we had presented in our last
projection. In the third quarter, a further moderately strong gain in
consumption is expected, supported by the July 1 elimination of the
tax surcharge and a lagged response of consumption to the large second
quarter income flow. The beginnings of a rebound in residential con-
struction outlays and a modest pick-up in inventory accumulation
should add somewhat to growth in aggregate output. In addition, a
rise in net exports is now projected to occur in the third quarter
instead of the decline we had formerly projected. In total, GNP is
expected to increase by $17 billion in the third quarter and a similar
gain is projected for the fourth quarter as a consequence of a stepped-
up recovery in construction outlays and some further rise in inventory
accumulation. In real terms the rate of increase is expected to average
about 3-1/2 per cent in the second half.
The sharp rise in the implicit GNP deflator in the first
quarter has raised serious questions in regard to the price outlook,
particularly in view of the projected strengthening of economic
activity as the year progresses. But it appears that some of the
first quarter acceleration reflected temporary factors, particularly
in construction and government. We have raised our second quarter
deflator estimate to a 4-1/2 per cent rate of increase, but with real
GNP growth projected to stay below potential throughout 1970, we still

II- 6
feel that the rise in industrial prices should slow and some easing of
food prices also seems likely. As a result, excluding the impact of
the Federal pay raise, we still expect a steady diminution in the rise
of the GNP deflator during 1970 to a 3.7 per cent rate by the fourth
quarter. Including the pay raise, however, the deflator is now pro-
jected to rise 5.0 per cent this year, up from a 4.7 per cent increase
in 1969.

for the month--probably a slight decline in the order of 0.2 to 0.4
per cent, following a rise of 0.2 per cent from February to March.
Output of consumer goods may have changed little in April, with a
decline in auto assemblies possibly offset by a rise in consumer
staples. Production of defense and freight and passenger equipment
(mainly trucks and aircraft) probably declined further. Output of
industrial and commercial equipment is expected to remain at the record
level reached in March; this sector has shown little movement since
last June, excluding the G.E. strike. Production of durable materials
may have stabilized at the reduced February-March level, but output
readjustments in some nondurable materials probably continued in April.
Auto assemblies through April 24, hampered by parts shortages
because of strikes in the trucking industry, were down 5 per cent from
March--to an annual rate of 6.7 million units. But production schedules
for May and June have been set at about an 8 million unit rate. In
early April, output of television sets declined 3 per cent but pro-
duction of household appliances increased 4 per cent. Output of trucks
declined 12 per cent through April 24. Among materials, weekly pro-
duction data indicate little change from March in output of raw steel
and paper, but output of rubber products declined further as a strike
at Goodyear began on April 21.

II -10
The decline in the total index since July 1969 has been
relatively small and concentrated in the durable goods industries,
both consumer goods and materials, and in defense equipment.

Defense equipment is expected to continue to fall off, but any significant
decline in total industrial production in the months ahead would most
likely require a downturn in output of business equipment and further
downward readjustments in production of industrial materials.
Retail sales. Data for the first three weeks of April suggest
that retail sales for the month may be about unchanged from March, with
continued sluggishness in the automotive sector offset by an increase
at nondurable stores. Unit sales of domestic autos were at an annual-- I

II -11
rate of 7.3 million units in the first 20 days of April, unchanged
from March,but 12 per cent below April 1969.
Retail sales in the first quarter were stronger than had
previously been reported, as the data for January and February were
revised up by an average of 1.6 per cent. Although retail sales in
March, according to the advance (now unpublished) report, were un-
changed from February and only 3.4 per cent above a year earlier;
the quarter as a whole is now estimated to have been 1.0 per cent
above the fourth quarter. In real terms sales were unchanged from
the fourth quarter and lower than in any quarter since the end of
1967.
Increased sales in the first quarter were largely
concentrated among nondurable goods stores, where sales increased
2.7 per cent. Much of the advance at food, liquor, drug, and
gasoline stores reflected higher prices. The general merchandise
group was also up moderately, and the higher proportion of real con-
sumption devoted to nondurables--as in other periods of slowed
economic activity--probably represents some discretionary shifting
from durables to nondurables.
Sales of durable goods in the first quarter dropped 2.7
per cent as a result of very large declines in the automotive group.
In contrast, furniture and appliance sales were up a substantial 5.6
per cent--after dropping in both the third and fourth quarters.

Consumer credit. Preliminary reports from a limited sample
of commercial banks point to a further slowing in March of the rise in
consumer instalment credit. The recent pattern of weakness in auto
credit and strength in nonautomotive consumer goods apparently continued
but the expansion in personal loans, which was at a $2 billion annual
rate in the first 2 months of this year, may have eased somewhat in
March.

Manufacturers' orders and shipments. New orders for durable
goods dropped back 3.5 per cent in March according to the preliminary
report, a somewhat larger decline than had been indicated by the
advance estimate. Except for a moderate rise in February, this series
has declined each month since September 1969, and is now about 11 per
cent below the September peak; this is the largest and longest decline
since the 13 per cent decline from September 1966 to the March 1967
trough.
Declines in the capital and defense goods industries in
March were partly offset by increases for iron and steel and house-
hold durables. Much of the decline in capital goods orders can be
ascribed to the small but volatile railroad equipment and ship-
building industries, but there was also a reduction in nonelectrical
machinery.
The average value of durable goods orders for the first
quarter as a whole was 6.5 per cent below the fourth-quarter average.
The largest declines were in defense products, motor vehicles, and
iron and steel,but capital equipment and "all other durables"
(principally construction materials) also declined.

Durable goods shipments also declined about 2 per cent from
February to March, and the order backlog declined 1 per cent. Unfilled
orders were down for most industry and market groups. The backlog is
now about 3.5 per cent below its December peak--a greater decline than
that from December 1966 to the April 1967 low point.
The backlog-shipments ratio rose slightly in March but remains
well below year-earlier levels. This ratio rose fairly steadily from
early 1964 through late 1966, little changed during the 1967 slow-
down, and has been declining ever since then.
Inventories. The book value of manufacturers' inventories
was practically unchanged in March, according to the preliminary report.
Durable goods stocks rose at about the average rate of the preceding
two months--a rate less than half the fourth quarter average--and

nondurable stocks declined. Unit auto stocks continued to decline in
March, although by less than in January and February.

The Commerce Department has estimated that first-quarter
inventory accumulation, as measured in the GNP accounts, slowed to a
$2.9 billion annual rate--the lowest in two years. This estimate was
made at a time when only January and preliminary February data were
available. The March data for manufacturing, together with some down-
ward revision in the February figures, suggest- that there may be
some downward revision in the preliminary GNP inventory estimate,
unless trade stocks rise very sharply in March.
In manufacturing, the durable inventory/sales and inventory/
backlog ratios rose further in March and continued above their levels

II -16
of the same month of 1967. Trade inventory-sales ratios were reduced
in January and February. The auto dealers' ratio for new cars rose
in March, however, and other trade ratios may also have risen if
retail sales were as sluggish as the advance estimate indicated.

Cyclical indicators. In March, the preliminary composite
leading indicator was little changed from an upward-revised February
level; it is now less than 2 per cent below its September high. The
coincident composite also changed little and is less than 1/2 of 1 per
cent below its high. Meanwhile, the lagging composite declined for
the third successive month and is about 1 per cent below its high.

Individual leading indicators pointing downward in March were
unemployment claims (inverted), durable goods new orders, contracts
and orders for plant and equipment (reflecting declines in construction
contracts as well as equipment orders), housing permits, and industrial
materials prices.
Leading indicators rising in March were the manufacturing
workweek, the common stock price index, and the ratio of price to
unit labor cost. The February upward revision in the composite
mainly reflects increases in the changes in inventory book values
and consumer instalment debt, which were not included in the pre-
liminary calculation last month. (Still to be incorporated in the
leading composite for the first three months of 1970 is a figure for
corporate profits after taxes.)

II -18
Preliminary data on April leading indicators show declines
in both the industrial materials and the common stock price indexes.
The March decline in the lagging indicators resulted from an
increase in long-duration unemployment and a decrease in commercial
and industrial loans at large commercial banks.

II -19
Residential construction and real estate. Seasonally ad-
justed private housing starts, which on the basis of revised seasonal
adjustment factors were at an annual rate of only 1.06 million units
1/in January,- rose for the second consecutive month in March to an
annual rate of 1.38 million units. Unlike February, all of the
increase was concentrated in the multifamily sector which advanced a
fifth further to the highest rate in nearly a year and matched the
reduced single family rate for the first time in the history of the
Census series. Regionally, the month-to-month movements continued
quite mixed, with a considerable advance in the North Central states
and a sharply continued rise in the Northeast more than offsetting
declines of 2 and 20 per cent in the South and West, respectively.
For the first quarter as a whole, however, starts were down
appreciably further from the fourth quarter of last year to an annual
rate of 1.25 million. Moreover, unlike developments in the last
three quarters of 1969, single family starts accounted for virtually
all of the quarter-to-quarter decline despite continued strong support
directly from FNMA and indirectly from the Federal Home Loan Banks.
1/ Compared with a rate of 1.20 million, based on the former seasonals
which were revised back to October 1967. Other months in the first
quarter were not appreciably affected by this revision. For 1969, use
of the new seasonals had the effect of lowering the first quarter
average rate by 4 per cent and raising the fourth quarter average some-
what. Other quarterly levels were essentially unchanged.

II -20
Multifamily starts, on the other hand, held near the relatively high
rate in the previous quarter, at a level a fourth below the record high
averaged in the first quarter of 1969.

1/ Seasonally adjusted annual rates; preliminary.
2/ Apart from starts, mobile home shipments for domestic use in
January and February--the latest months available--were at a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 367 thousand, a tenth below
the record rate a year earlier.
A factor in the comparatively strong first quarter per-
formance of multifamily starts apparently has been the ability of
builders--particularly of large apartment complexes--to secure funds
through joint-ventures, equity-participations, and related arrange-
ments. In addition, vacancies in the Northeast as well as other
regions remain exceptionally low and the incentive to move ahead of

II -21
rising labor and other construction costs continues. Still, given
the protracted tightness that has prevailed in financial markets, the
recent seasonally adjusted rate of multifamily starts does not seem
sustainable. Even if the rate of single family starts changes little
over the period ahead, indications are that the total starts rate will
most likely turn downward in April and contribute to some further
downtrend for the second quarter as a whole.
Prices of existing homes sold in February remained 7 per
cent higher than a year earlier. However, based on sales of new
single family homes by merchant builders, who account for about three-
fifths of the new home market, efforts by buyers to concentrate on
lower-priced homes have apparently increased. Altogether, the median
price of new single family homes purchased from merchant builders in
February amounted to $23.6 thousand, a tenth below a year earlier,
and--continuing a trend which began to develop last summer--
appreciably below the median price level for new homes available
for sale which has persisted upward.
Labor market. The labor market apparently has continued to
ease. Insured unemployment has dropped less than seasonally thus far
in April and, at 1.7 million (not seasonally adjusted) in the week
ending April 11, was nearly 600,000 higher than a year earlier.
Initial claims for unemployment benefits for the week ending April 18
were 40,000 higher than in the preceding week--although a seasonal

II -22
decline usually occurs in mid-April--and 170,000 above a year earlier.
Secondary layoffs arising from the teamster strikes and employer
lockouts, which have cut the flow of parts and final goods, contributed
to the higher levels, but continuing layoffs in the aerospace, defense,
and consumer durables industries suggest that joblessness probably
would have risen in the absence of these disputes.

The overall unemployment rate rose from 4.2 per cent in
February to 4.4 per cent in March, extending the steady rise of recent
months. The March increase occurred mainly among adults, and the
jobless rate for men aged 25 and over rose to 2.4 per cent--its
highest point since mid-1966. Part of the March rise in unemployment
appeared to reflect increased joblessness among labor force entrants,
whereas the January and February increases appear to have been mainly
a result of layoffs.

II -23
Employment trends. As is typical of cyclical adjustments,
the impact of the recent adjustment has centered in manufacturing. In
March, manufacturing employment declined further by 56,000 to 19.8
million--a drop of half a million from its August 1969 peak. Employ-
ment cuts were widespread among the 21 manufacturing industries in
March, but most were relatively small. Only four industries reported
increases, and with the exception of transportation equipment (where
the small pickup of auto production boosted employment) the gains were
negligible. The average factory workweek recovered from the unusually
low February level of 39.9 hours to 40.2 hours in March--but remained
below the January level, and was more than half an hour lower than a
year earlier.
Outside of manufacturing, employment growth has continued
quite strong. March employment changes in the nonmanufacturing
industries were mixed, with trade showing a decline and most other
industries recording small increases. The decline in trade may reflect
seasonal adjustment problems associated with an early Easter. Federal
employment rose by 75,000 in March as temporary census workers were
added to the government payroll. Preliminary estimates of total
nonfarm employment reported for January and February have been revised
up substantially, raising the reported first quarter employment rise
in the private nonmanufacturing industries and in government.

Personal income. Personal income rose by $4.1 billion in
March--about the same as the upward revised February increase--to an
annual rate of $782.6 billion. Over the last six months personal income
increases have averaged a little less than $4 billion monthly, compared
with advances of $5 billion monthly in the preceding six months.
Total wages and salaries increased by $2.4 billion in March
(an annual rate of 5-1/2 per cent)--about the same as the upward re-
vised February change but still smaller than the average monthly rise
over the last six months of 1969. Wage and salary disbursements rose
slightly in manufacturing, reflecting an increase in hourly earnings.
In other sectors, wage and salary payments rose about in line with
employment and hourly earnings changes. Nonwage income flows also
increased in March, with a relatively large rise in transfer payments
reflecting more persons drawing unemployment benefits.

The April personal income figures will be sharply higher
because of the retroactive increases in social security payments and
in Federal pay. However, the widening impact of the teamster strikes
and lockouts may limit any advance in wage and salary flows in the
private sector.
Industrial relations. Teamsters' union members will be
asked shortly to ratify the tentative national agreement, but with
an added provision that the contract may be reopened if a substantial
number of Chicago-area drivers succeed in negotiating a larger
package. In Chicago, where the locals negotiate separately, agreements
providing larger increases than the national contract have been reached
by some smaller trucking associations. Thus, the national agreement
may be renegotiated, even if tentatively accepted by the 450,000 team-
ster members. In 1967 such a renegotiation following a strike of the
Chicago locals led to a larger wage increase. Meanwhile, strikes
and lockouts of 50,000 to 60,000 drivers continue to disrupt transport,

II -26
resulting in production cuts and some layoffs at auto, electrical
product, farm machinery, and steel plants.
Nearly 25,000 rubber workers at Goodyear plants went on
strike April 21 while an estimated 50,000 rubber workers at Uniroyal,
Firestone and Goodrich continue to work on a day-to-day basis. The
areas of disagreement on the terms of a new contract were not re-
vealed. Tire shortages are not expected to develop for some time
because of anticipatory inventory buildups.
Wage increases affecting many workers have resulted from
recent settlements. Federal government civilian and military personnel
received a 6 per cent pay increase retroactive to December 27, 1969,
and postal workers are expected to receive an additional 8 per cent
upon passage of a postal reform bill. The 18-month railroad
shopcraft dispute was settled when Congress imposed the December 1969
settlement on the sheet metal workers. The settlement provides
wage increases (partly retroactive to January 1, 1969) totaling about
19 per cent by the end of the year, with most of this increase
effective immediately. An early settlement between 7,500 meat cutters
and Swift provided an average 6 per cent annual wage increase over a
41-month contract (but with an 8-1/2 per cent immediate increase).
Upward pressure on wages will also continue in construction
as the spring bargaining round progresses. So far this year, con-
struction settlements have resulted in wage and benefit increases in the
12-1/2 per cent range, or about as much as last year.

II -26 A
Wholesale prices. The preliminary wholesale price index for
April (March 11 to April 14) showed a 0.1 per cent decline--the first
since August 1968--as the average price of agriculturally-based
commodities declined 1.2 per cent. Sharp declines in prices of live-
stock, especially hogs, and of eggs were mainly responsible for the
large drop in agricultural commodities. The 0.3 per cent increase for
industrial commodities was the same as the rise in March, which was the
smallest since last July.
Since December, industrial prices have increased at an annual
rate of 3.9 per cent, compared with 4.8 per cent in the previous four
months. The rise in agricultural products has moderated more dramatically.
Widespread increases among fuel and related products were the leading
influences in April on the further advance in prices of industrial
commodities. Other products contributing to the April increase in-
clude chemicals, paper products, and lumber and wood products--the
latter group increasing for the first time since last November.
Increases in coal prices of about 10 per cent effective
April 1, 1970,have been announced recently by several companies to
offset added costs resulting from the new Federal Mine Health and
Safety Law, which became effective April 1, 1970. These coal companies
and others who have not yet raised their prices expect that customers
will offer little resistance to the increases, which may reach 30 per
cent by year-end as a result of regulations now applicable under the

II -27
new law, additional regulations which will become effective later in the
year, and rising wage costs.

From October 1969 to January of this year, both the Federal
Reserve sensitive materials index and the BLS index of 13 raw industrial
materials moved to substantially higher levels. The trend in both series
was downward, however, from January through March--and through April for
the BLS index for 13 raw industrial materials. Price increases in April
for copper and aluminum ingot and fabricated products probably more
than offset a decline in the price of steel scrap. This may reverse
in April the preceding downward movement of the Federal Reserve
sensitive materials index.rates)

II -28
Other materials in the FRB materials index, usually less
prompt and less volatile in their response to variation in demand than
are prices for sensitive materials, have moved up continuously since
mid-1968. Increases in steel mill products have been of particular
importance in the recent upward movement of the other materials price
index.
Since mid-April, announcements of price changes have included
decreases for stainless steel and sulphur. The cuts on stainless steel
were triggered by weakness in new orders, but the 2 to 3 per cent re-
ductions have been restricted so far to some of the low-volume products
which account for less than 5 per cent of total stainless steel shipments
and have not been extended to sheet and strip.
Sulphur prices have declined further as stockpiles have grown
rapidly with continued increased in Canadian production, but prices of
sulphuric acid, which usually move with sulphur prices, apparently have
not yet been cut. Major producers say that they are not going to re-
duce prices of sulphuric acid, but will use the cost savings from
lower-priced sulphur to offset increasing costs of labor and pollution
control. The costs of pollution control have begun to be mentioned
prominently as reasons for price increases or for denying price de-
creases, and it appears that such costs may well be cited increasingly
in defense of price increases.

II -29
Consumer prices. In March, the increase in the consumer price
index after seasonal adjustment, an annual rate of 5 per cent, was slower
than in the immediately preceding months. This slowing occurred despite
a very sharp increase in service costs stemming in the main from the
phasing in of the higher permissible rates of FHA mortgages. In March,
mortgage rate increases contributed 28 per cent and service costs as a
group 70 per cent of the rise in consumer prices.
Probably of more significance for prospective price developments
was the smallness of the rise in food prices in March following a diminish-
ed rate of rise in February. Meat prices rose moderately, but this
and other increases were largely offset by a sharp drop in egg prices.
Since spot prices of meat at wholesale have leveled off in the last
six weeks, retail meat prices may well show little change in April
and May. Beef slaughter is likely to continue to rise moderately in
this quarter, but no significant drop in meat prices is expected until
the fall when hog marketings are expected to rise substantially.
Among other nondurables, apparel prices rose more than
seasonally in both February and March, but because of a decline in
January, the rise in the first quarter was only about half as rapid as
in any quarter of 1969.
Among durable commodities, prices of new cars dropped slightly
and used cars dropped further. The decline in used car prices in February
and March is in contrast to the first quarter of last year, when prices
rose sharply. Home purchase prices continued their uptrend and there

was an especially sharp increase in prices of household durables,
including appliances and furniture. The rise in consumer durables
(except cars) was responsible for most of the March increase in the
commodity portion of the index.
The large increase in interest rates on home mortgage rates
in both February and March reflects the increase in interest rates on
Government underwritten mortgages which was authorized early this
year. The GI increase was phased into the CPI in February and the
FHA increase in March, causing an 8 per cent annual rate of rise in
costs of insurance and finance that month. Costs of insurance and
finance have risen more than other major components of the CPI over
the past year. In March this grouping was 14 per cent above a year
ago. Medical care costs in March registered their largest increase
since 1966, and were 7 per cent above a year earlier.

A note on the GNP deflator. The rise in the GNP deflator
accelerated in the first quarter. But there is reason to believe that this
acceleration does not portend thatprice increases generally are, or are
likely to be, speeding up. Evidence from other sources suggests that there
may have been some speed-up of price increase in the fixed investment
sector, but the pattern of monthly changes indicates some slowing over
the quarter in the price rise of sensitive materials and foods.
The GNP deflator is measured on the basis of average prices
during the quarter, so that it may not reflect the trend of prices
during a quarter. But the WPI and the CPI are available monthly. Over
the course of the first quarter, there was some slowdown from month to month
in the rise in both wholesale and seasonally adjusted consumer prices.
If mortgage interest rates (which are not included in the GNP deflator)
were excepted, the slowdown in consumer prices would have been even more
pronounced. Some deceleration in the rate of price advance can be
observed in agricultural materials, sensitive industrial materials, foods,
and other consumer commodities.
So far as goods are concerned, the GNP deflator measures mainly
prices of finished goods, with prices of materials reflected directly
only in the inventory change component. A further characteristic of
the deflator in contrast to the fixed weights of the WPI and CPI, is
that the weights change from quarter to quarter. Shifts in the pattern

II -33
of GNP expenditures can have an appreciable effect on the deflator. Thus,
the first quarter acceleration in the government component of the deflator
to a marked degree reflects shifts in weights.
The following table compares the deflators with selected other
price series. It can be seen that even when price changes are computed
on a quarterly average basis to correspond with the deflator, there is
little correspondence between quarterly increases in the deflator and
relevant components of the CPI and WPI. For the year 1969, however, the
deflator for nondurable consumer expenditures rose by about the same
percentage as the corresponding CPI component. When the CPI index for
services is adjusted for comparability of coverage by excluding home
finance, the rise last year is also fairly close to that in the consumer
services deflator. The durable goods component of the deflator and of
the CPI do not correspond well, even after adjustment for comparability
of coverage.

In the area of fixed investment, the deflator shows an
acceleration in prices of producers' durables in the first quarter whereas
the WPI of producers' equipment shows a slowing of the rise. The deflator
for producers' equipment is seasonally adjusted, however, and the WPI
series is unadjusted. Despite this recent divergence between the two
series, it is clear from the table that equipment prices have been
climbing at a stepped-up rate since the middle of last year.
Much of the apparent acceleration in prices in the first
quarter arises from the sharp rise in the deflator for residential
construction. This deflator is moved by Boeckhs' index of residential
construction costs, with some adjustments. But this index has shown
some puzzling changes--for example, declining--from an annual rate of
rise of 12 per cent to a rate of only 1 per cent from the first to the
fourth quarter of last year.

II -36
Food supply developments. Recent surveys of farmers' production
plans tend to confirm earlier projections of the Department of Agriculture
indicating that not much rise in per capita consumption of food from the
record consumption of 1969 is likely in 1970. The Department expects
retail food prices to average about 4 per cent above 1969 with pressure
on prices easing in the second half of the year when supplies of fresh
vegetables and pork, the items now in shortest supply, begin to expand.
To hold the average to 4 per cent, retail prices will actually have to
decline a little from current levels later in the year. Prices received
by farmers in 1970 are expected to average about 2 per cent above 1969
with livestock products about 5 per cent above and crops about 2 per
cent below 1969. Average farm prices are expected to ease throughout the
year from the high of this February.
The Department foresees little expansion in per capita supplies
of red meats until the fourth quarter when pork production will expand
as pigs from the relatively large 1970 spring pig crop are marketed.
Poultry meat supplies will be increasing throughout the year. The record
annual per capita beef supply of 113 pounds is expected to be spread more
evenly over the year than in 1969. About 3 pounds each of veal and lamb
will be available per person for the year. Stepped up imports of meat
subject to quota added nearly half a pound to beef supplies in the first
quarter. Should the President suspend the quota for the rest of 1970, as
suggested in some quarters, net additions to the per capita supplies of
beef shown in the table ranging from 0.2 to 0.8 pounds per quarter would

II -37
be possible depending on the terms of the waiver. In 1969, net imports
of all meats amounted to 8.5 pounds per person (carcass weight), and
quota meats, mostly beef, amounted to 5.5 pounds per person. Quota beef
competes principally with lower grades of domestic beef.

Farmland prices. Prices of U.S. farmland advanced 4 per cent in
the year ending March 1, the same as the annual advance reported in November
but slower than the March 1968-69 increase of 5 per cent. Annual increases
have been slowing since the 7 per cent rise of 1965-66 when strong demands
for grains associated with world food shortages boosted land prices. Annual
rates of increase in the past decade have averaged 5.3 per cent. Values
this March averaged 2 per cent higher than in November. Some quickening in
the pace of increase was evident in the Richmond District and in some of
the midwestern Districts this spring.

II- 38
Divergence in regional trends in land values is more marked
this year than at any time since 1965-66 when values in the Federal
Reserve Districts located in the great specialized agricultural areas
of the midwest rose at annual rates of 10 to 12 per cent while values
in the Districts of the Northeast rose at annual rates of 4 to 6 per
cent. This spring, the divergencs is just as great, but values in the
northeast are booming with annual increases ranging from 7 to 13 per
cent while values in the central agricultural areas are lagging with
advances of only 2 to 4 per cent and, in the San Francisco District,
only 1 per cent.
An important influence reflected in the widespread slackening
expansion in land values is the prospect for little or no improvement
in farmers' net earnings this year, particularly the net earnings of
crop producers. Slow turnover in land suggests that scarce supplies and
high costs of credit are also dampening the demand for land. Another
factor is uncertainty hanging over the heads of wheat, feed grain, and
cotton farmers about government programs that will replace those ones
expiring at the end of this crop year. These factors undoubtedly weigh
heavily in the decisions of crop producers in the central United States.
Relative ebullience in values throughout the Northeast and in
Pennsylvania and Maryland where increases of 14 and 11 per cent were
reported undoubtedly reflects non-farm demands to a large extent. Expand-
ing resort areas and spreading urbanization are enhancing the value of
nearby agricultural lands by creating the potential demand for non-farm
use. However, rising milk prices throughout 1969 and early 1970 may have

II -9
strengthened values in dairy areas even though reported net earnings of
dairy producers in 1909 were not greatly improved as compared with 1968.
In the Atlanta District, a mix of strong farm and nonfarm
demands for land, especially in Georgia and Florida, continues to support
gains in land values double the national average. In the Ricmond District,
the annual increase qas held to 3 per cent by declines in values in West
Virginia and North Carolina and no change in South Carolina. Uncertain-
ties facing tobacco loom large in the structure of values in these states.
However, values picked up between the November and March surveys, notably
in North Carolina.

THE ECONOMIC PICTURE IN DETAIL
Domestic Financial Situation
Bank credit. On the basis of partial data, bank credit
developments in April appear to be conforming generally to those recorded
in March, with banks adding substantially to their holdings of U.S.
Treasury and other securities and loan developments continuing weak. On
balance, however, total bank credit (on an end-of-month basis) is
expected to show a larger rise in April than in March, reflecting mainly
greater acquisitions of Governments and somewhat less weakness in busi-
ness loans. Holdings of municipal securities have been expanding some-
what less rapidly in April than in March; at weekly reporting banks,
these acquisitions include a larger proportion of longer maturities than
was the case in March.
Business loans appear to be expanding quite slowly in April
after declining somewhat in March. For the two months together the
trend of business borrowing at banks has been substantially weaker than
earlier this year, even after allowing for possible difficulties with
seasonal factors and for loan sales. This slowdown may reflect in part
the drop in the rate of business inventory accumulation; an additional
factor appears to have been the repayment of bank debts out of the
proceeds of capital market financing, particularly by public utilities.
The slow pace of increase in consumer and real estate loans
prevalent since the middle of last year appears to have continued over
the recent period. Finance company demand for bank loans also appears
to have been weak, as was the case earlier this year.

Monetary aggregates. The strong March uptrend in monetary
aggregates has slowed in April, but, as a result of the March trend,
the average level of deposits outstanding in April will be well above
that for March. Total member bank deposits are expected to rise at an
annual rate of 18 per cent. Total funds obtained from nondeposit
sources of funds are expected to decline slightly in April and the total

of member bank deposits plus these sources (the adjusted credit proxy)
is expected to rise at a 14.5 per cent rate.

directly through brokers or dealers; liabilities to banks' own
branches in U.S. territories and possessions; and liabilities to
banks' own foreign branches.
Demand deposits dropped steadily after the sharp bulge at the
end of March, but the rate of deposit decline has been somewhat slower
than earlier expected, and average deposits for the month of April
appear to be up substantially over March. Public currency holdings also
increased sharply from March to April and the average money supply for
April is expected to exceed the March figure by an annual rate of 12.5
per cent.

III -4
The growth in average time and savings deposits in April also
fell off sharply as the month progressed, but the increase in the average
for the month is expected to be at an annual rate of increase of about
22 per cent.
At weekly reporting banks, seasonally unadjusted data for the
three weeks ended April 15 indicate that, as in March, large certifi-
cates of deposits continued to provide a major share of the incoming
time and savings deposit funds. CD acquisitions by individuals, partner-
ships, and corporations accounted for nearly half of the total CD
expansion in these three weeks. Growth in CD holdings of other investors
was accounted for primarily by States and municipalities, who also were
mainly responsible for the sharp gain in the "all other" time deposit
category. In contrast, foreign official institution holdings of CD's
and other time deposits, which had sustained these deposits earlier in
the year, continued to run off moderately,as banks replaced some of
their maturities with lower cost funds from domestic sources. The sharp
runup in U.S. Treasury bill yields that began in late March carried
these yields above the ceiling rates on most CD maturities in the week
beginning April 20 and the inflow of funds into CD's was reduced signif-
icantly.
The flow of consumer-type time deposits, which had been
sizable at weekly reporting banks in March, rose sharply further in the
week ending April 1 but then dropped off substantially. During the two
weeks ending April 15, net outflows of consumer-type deposits at these
banks were nearly as large as the heavy outflows in the comparable period

III -5
of last year. Withdrawals for tax payments as well as for transfers to
higher yielding market instruments undoubtedly accounted for this move-
ment. At country member banks, time and savings deposits also increased
rapidly over the early part of April, but inflows slackened considerably
around mid-month.
As in March, growth in deposits through mid-April was offset
in part by the decline in nondeposit sources of funds. Both commercial
paper indebtedness and funds obtained outside the U.S. were reduced,
apparently in response to the reduced pressures on reserve positions.

Nonbank depositary institutions. During the recently-
concluded reinvestment period, net withdrawals from savings and loan
associations in total were minimal; in fact, associations outside of
the San Francisco FHLB district actually received net new funds. Large
mutual savings banks in New York City, on the other hand, posted sizable
deposit outflows during the reinvestment period; these particular
institutions have large, sophisticated depositors who no doubt have
access to a whole spectrum of alternative investments. Although no
formal surveys have been taken, there are reports that other mutual
savings banks have had a very mixed experience recently; institutions
in Philadelphia, for example, received record inflows, while some
small-town New England savings banks suffered large outflows.

For the month of March, deposit growth at the thrift institu-
tions--again, particularly at savings and loan associations--was very
strong, reflecting the convergence of higher rate ceilings with declin-
ing yields on short-term market securities and a lackluster stock
market. In February and March taken together, growth at both institu-
tions averaged considerably stronger than in the previous three
quarters. Indications for the first three weeks of April suggest that
deposit growth at savings and loans continued in this relatively large
volume.

E/ Preliminary.
Despite the higher deposit growth, savings and loan associa-
tions in March acquired only a very modest net amount of mortgages and,
on a seasonally adjusted basis, made new mortgage commitments at a
lower rate than in February. A very large portion of funds received

Mortgage market. New commitment activity in the home mortgage
market appears to have increased through late April. However, this is a
time when demands for mortgage credit ordinarily continue to expand
strongly, and data are not yet available to show whether the increase
from depressed levels was more than seasonal. In the case of savings
and loan associations, new mortgage commitments approved in March rose
somewhat less than usual for the month.
These developments followed a more than seasonal decline
during the first quarter in net mortgage acquisitions by all types of
private lenders, except possibly life insurance companies which were
already at a very reduced rate. The drop in the pace of expansion of
total mortgage debt outstanding--the fourth successive quarterly
decline--brought the seasonally adjusted annual rate for the quarter
down to about $21 billion, a third below the high in early 1969 and the
lowest level in nearly three years. All types of properties apparently
shared in the decline, including home mortgages despite additional
heavy support from FNMA.
However, fragmentary FNMA field reports and trade opinion
indicate that in April more investors were reentering the home mortgage
market or were stepping up their limited volume of new commitments.
Evidencing a somewhat larger supply of funds available from regular
market sources, the volume of bids submitted in FNMA's forward commit-
ment auction was lower in April than in March. As an indication of
increased investor interest in mortgages, a number of mortgage companies
were said to be unable to accommodate all new over-the-counter requests
for loans to be delivered immediately.

III -11
The improved tone of the home mortgage market in recent weeks
also has been evidenced by scattered trade rumors that the contract
interest rate on FHA and VA loans might be reduced in the near future
by administrative action. These expectations have apparently been
bolstered in part by the yield decline that has already taken place in
FNMA's bi-weekly auction of forward commitments to purchase Government
underwritten mortgages. The average yield on 6-month commitments in
the April 20 auction, which reached a new low for the year, was 32 basis
points below the peak in early January.

During March average contract interest rates on conventional
new-home mortgages in the primary market held at the record level
reached in January, according to FHA reports. Meanwhile, yields on FHA
mortgages traded in the more sensitive secondary market were reported
lower for the first time in a year and a half, and discounts on these
loans declined to the least restrictive level since last spring. Rela-
tive to the sharp rise in yields on new issues of high-grade corporate
bonds, however, average returns on home mortgages became less attrac-
tive--a trend that probably continued in April as well.

Corporate and municipal securities markets. Yields in long-
term debt markets, other than for mortgages, rebounded in April--to
levels just short of the December high--under the pressure of a rising
volume of new security issues and the prospect of sustained high levels
of corporate and municipal borrowing throughout at least the second
quarter. Stock prices--which through the end of March had gradually
recovered from their January lows--have retreated significantly during
April in moderate trading volume. Over the three weeks ended April 24,
for example, the Composite Index of all NYSE stocks lost 8.4 per cent,
and declining prices continued into the last week of the month.

Part of the stock price weakness--which has affected long-term
securities generally--can be attributed to a growing expectation that
anti-inflationary policies may not be as effective in lessening demand
pressures as had been assumed. In addition, selected stocks have been
depressed even further in response to unfavorable first quarter earnings
reports. This earnings reaction appears to have been particularly strong
in issues listed on the AMEX. The AMEX Index has declined more than
10 per cent since April 3 and by April 24 stood nearly one-third below
its cyclical high in late 1968. Investment quality stock, represented
by the Dow Jones Industrial Average, have generally shown greater price
strength in recent months and, although the Dow Jones Index slid to its
lowest point in six and one-half years in the last week of April, the
percentage decline over the month was less than for the other indexes.

In the bond market, supply problems have been a major factor
in the renewed weakness. Corporations, struggling with the problems of
reduced internal funds flows, low liquidity levels, balance sheet dis-
tortions from previous short-term borrowing, and capital expansion
programs, have inundated the bond market with new issues. Staff esti-
mates are that total public bond issues in the first half of 1970 will
total about $11.7 billion, double the volume of the same period in 1969
and about 90 per cent of the entire 1969 bond volume. A postwar monthly
record of $2.0 billion for public bond offerings in April and the opening
of the $1.6 billion rights offering of AT&T debentures that month, follow-
ing a $1.9 billion level of new public bond issues in March, exerted
strong upward pressure on corporate bond yields. There was a brief price
rally in early April when underwriters, operating in the buoyant atmos-
phere generated by indications of easing credit conditions, priced new
issues so aggressively that the Board's index of high-grade new issue
yields dropped near the mid-February low. At such leilds, however,
demand by institutional and individual investors was insufficient to
absorb the high volume coming to market. By mid-April, with dealer
inventories uncomfortably high and the announcement of generous terms
on the AT&T financing, bond rates began to climb. Within a week, seven
syndicates had broken, releasing about $135 million of unsold bonds at
sharply reduced prices. But institutional investors still tended to
stay on the sidelines, concentrating their purchases on attractively
priced industrial issues, which could offer 10-year call procection and
portfolio diversification; individuals, as they have since late 1969,

III 16
continued to be a major Support of the bond market. On April 24,
corporate bond rates had returned to the levels previaling in the con-
gested markets of late March, only 10 basis points below the record
highs of December.

New commitments for privately placed bonds by life insurance
companies are sharply below year-ago levels, but figures for January
takedowns of private placements just released by the SEC indicate that
take-downs by all institutional investors were maintained at levels
higher than previously estimated by Board staff. Although the extended
decline in the stock market during the four months of the year has
probably dampened the growth of new issue volume to some extent, new
issue volume has remained large. Offerings of common and preferred
stock in April amounted to $600 million, and the staff estimates that
volume will rise slightly in May and June, to a monthly average of about
$700 million. The staff now estimates the monthly average gross proceeds
from all new corporate security issues will be about $3.5 billion in the
second quarter, two-thirds above the previous record of $2.1 billion.

The prolonged decline in municipal yields through most of
the first quarter of 1970 was reversed in April. New issues of long-
term debt by State and local governments accelerated in late March, and
April volume rose to about $1.7 billion, only slightly below the 1969
high. It is reported that bank purchases of municipals, which had
been an important supporting factor in March, tapered off after mid-
April.- Dealer inventories, especially of longer maturities, built
up and the market was also depressed by an IRS challenge to the interest
deductability of bank funds (other than time deposits) used to acquire
municipals. The May and June calendars are building slowly at present,
and new issue totals in these months may not be very different from the
average for the first quarter. However, the backlog of authorized
issues for which no date has been set is very large. Moreover, addi-
tional State and local units have raised interest rate ceilings, and,
if the California electorate approves the increase that will be put on
the June ballot, new issue volume could spurt suddenly.
1/ Because of the 30-day average delivery lag for municipals this
decline would not appear in bank statistics on securities holdings
until May. Even then the bank figures may be distorted by bank
dealer operations.

III -19
Government securities market. Yields on Treasury coupon
issues have moved steadily higher since late March and are now back
to the levels of mid-February, or for 5-10 year maturities around 40-
60 basis points below their late 1969 highs. In part, the increases
reflected dealer preparations for the Treasury's May financing; but,
probably more importantly, they also mirrored the persistent upward
rate pressures in corporate and municipal markets and changed expecta-
tions regarding the economy and fiscal and monetary policies. The
Treasury bill market in April has been frequently characterized by
very large swings in rates. On balance, however, rates in the bill
market have increased by 30 to around 80 basis points during the month,
as April bill demands did not come up to the market's expectations and
as a rise in the cost of day-to-day money led to aggressive attempts
by dealers to ligten their positions.

In the Treasury note and bond market, prices have generally
moved down in reaction to higher yields on new offerings of corporate
issues, the consequent diversion of investor interest away from the
Government market, and an additional agency demands for funds through
a $400 million FNMA offering at the end of April and an offering of the
same size of GNMA backed mortgage bonds in early May. This weakness
has been reinforced recently as dealers have attempted to adjust to

III -21
the forthcoming Treasury financing. The terms of the financing will be
announced on April 29 and will be outlined in the Supplement.
Dealers' Treasury bill positions increased very sharply in
the first three weeks of April. This increase, which occurred primarily
in longer bill holdings, would in part be expected on seasonal grounds
as the market prepared for demands from public funds and for reinvest-
ment of April tax bills not used for tax purposes. To a large extent,
however, the very large rise in positions appears to have been attribu-
table to dealer speculative positioning of the end-March supply of
longer bills in anticipation of a continuing easier monetary policy
and further declines in bill rates over the second quarter. In the
event, reinvestment demand, as well as demand from public funds, turned
out to be somewhat less than anticipated, and contrary to earlier market
expectations the money market firmed, with Federal funds averaging
above 8 per cent over the last two weeks. Consequently dealers turned
less optimistic on the likelihood of easier monetary conditions, backed
away from the regular bill auctions, and moved aggressively to lighten
their bill positions, with the result that rates have risen sharply
on balance.
The market for Federal Agency securities has been relatively
quiet in April, with new issues offered or announced thus far in the
minth raising about $800 million in new money, compared to a total of
$1.4 billion in March. A rate of 8.40 per cent was announced on the
$400 million 28-month FNMA issue. Rates for most other new issues offered

III 22
thus far in April, all of which were for relatively short maturities,
were marginally lower than in March. Until very recently the market
for short-term outstanding Agency securities has been firmer on balance,
while the longer-term Agency market weakened slightly less than other
long-term markets. However, rates for both long and short Agency issues
have moved sharply higher in the latest week, paralleling the weakness
in other coupon markets.

placed through dealers rose around $200 million, while directly placed
paper declined $150 million. Bank-related paper grew about $100 million

Federal finance. The Board staff now projects a fiscal 1970
surplus of about $.8 billion on a NIA basis and a deficit of $2.5
billion on a unified budget basis. The Staff's current estimate of
budget outlays in fiscal 1970 has been raised to about $199.0 billion--

III -25
more than $1 billion above the level indicated in the January budget
document. As shown in the table below, the Administration is expected
to make expenditure cuts--or to permit lags in program performance--in
a number of categories. These cuts should partially offset the increase
in fiscal 1970 outlays resulting from the Federal pay raise ($1.2
billion), the Congressional approval of increased outlays for education
($.4 billion), and anticipated increases for certain hard to control
items ($.5 billion).
Outlays for fiscal 1971 are now expected to be about $3.0
billion above the level forecast by the Budget Bureau in January. This
increase seems in prospect now, though the recently proposed postal rate
increase (a negative expenditure) and the expected postponement (to
fiscal 1972) of the family assistance and revenue sharing programs would
cut $1.2 billion from fiscal 1971 outlays. No changes are scheduled in
planned defense outlays--other than the pay raise--in either fiscal year
1970 or 1971.
Total receipts in April now appear to be about as estimated
by the Staff in the last Greenbook, with a shortfall in estimated
corporate receipts offset by receipts higher than estimated in the
individual income tax category. The Staff estimate of total receipts
for fiscal 1970 ($196.5 billion) continues to be substantially below
the figure ($199.4 billion) in the January budget document.
The end-of-April cash balance at the Treasury is projected
to be $7.4 billion. Assuming attrition of about $1.0 billion on the
refunding of $4.8 billion of notes (held by public) maturing in mid-May,

III -26
the Treasury is expected to seek about $2.0 billion of new financing
for payment in the last week of May or early in June to tide it over the
early weeks of June prior to the inflow of that month's corporate tax
receipts. If payment occurs in late May, the Treasury debt outstanding
could come within $.3 billion of the legal debt ceiling at that time.
For the Federal Sector in the national income accounts, the
Staff now projects an $.8 billion surplus in fiscal 1970, a $5.3 billion
deficit in calendar 1970, and--very tentatively--a $2 to $3 billion
deficit in fiscal year 1971. As indicated in the last Greenbook, how-
ever, the shift toward deficit appears to be largely the result of low
levels of projected economic growth rather than of discretionary changes
in fiscal policy. The table that follows shows the Staff's latest fore-
cast of the high employment budget.* Despite the projected sharp shift
toward deficit in the federal sector from calendar 1969 to calendar
1970, the high employment surplus is expected to fall only $.5 billion
during this period. The Staff forecast shows a temporary shift toward
fiscal ease in the second quarter, largely resulting from the retroactive
increases in Federal pay and in Social Security benefits. Thereafter
the budget is expected to become more restrictive. As indicated in the
table, a $15.6 billion high employment surplus is now projected for the
first half of calendar 1971.
* These new estimates are not comparable to those shown in the last
Greenbook because a different procedure has been introduced for calcu-
lating the high employment surplus. The present procedure involves a
more detailed analysis of the components of high employment revenues,
and attempts to correct for the bias toward fiscal restraint that
generally appears in measures of the high employment surplus during
periods of inflation.

THE ECONOMIC PICTURE  IN DETAIL
International Developments
U.S. balance of payments. The underlying balance of
payments deficit appears to have been running in February-arch
at an annual rate in the $4-5 billion range. This can be seen
in the table below in terms of either the adjusted over-all balance
(financed by reserve transactions and U.S. commercial bank borrow-
ing) or the liquidity balance before special transactions. The
pattern of seasonal adjustments has become increasingly suspect,
since it does not yet adequately reflect the large year-end flows
that have resulted from the imposition of more severe restraints
on capital flows in 1968. The apparent bulge in the deficit in
January reflects these transitory flows, rather than a worsening
in other transactions.

IV -2
Some weakening in the trade balance and a larger capital
outflow reported by banks were factors in the increase in these
over-all deficits between February and March. The trade balance
had been quite large in February, and was reduced in March as
exports eased off while imports held at what is still a relatively
high level. For the first quarter the trade surplus was at an
annual rate of about $2-1/4 billion, a little lower than expected
earlier because of the strength of imports.
Claims on foreigners reported by U.S. banks were reduced
considerably in January and February, but rose by about $200 million
in March. The net reduction in claims for the quarter, seasonally
adjusted, was about $250 million.
Inflows of foreign capital to purchase U.S. corporate
securities were much lower in the first quarter of this year than
in the like period of 1968 or 1969, as shown in the following table.

IV -3
U.S. corporations have reduced their sales of new issues
abroad in the face of tighter markets, and probably also because
many of them have substantial unused proceeds of earlier borrowings
that they can use to finance their direct investments. Foreign
dealings in U.S. corporate stocks again resulted in a net liquidation
in March, but there has been some inflow of foreign funds to
purchase U.S. corporate bonds. Current projections of the U.S.
balance of payments for the rest of the year depend to a considerable
extent on a much stronger inflow of foreign capital to purchase
securities than has occurred so far.
Net U.S. purchases of foreign securities amounted to
about $225 million in the first quarter, a little less than the
quarterly averages of 1968 and 1969. The reduction in outflows
results mainly from a change in investments in foreign corporate
stocks; in 1968 and 1969 average quarterly net U.S. purchases of
such securities were about $100 million, but there were net sales
of nearly that amount in the first quarter of this year. The change
reflects, among other factors, lessened interest in Japanese securities
and the shares of gold-producing enterprises.
On the official settlements basis the first-quarter deficit
was about $3-1/4 billion -- using the old seasonal factors. The large
difference between this balance and the adjusted over-all balance
reflects the almost continuous reduction in U.S. bank liabilities
to their branches since mid-January; from that point through April 22

IV -4
the reduction has amounted to about $2.3 billion. Part of this
decline in liabilities was related to switching of foreign official
accounts from the Euro-dollar market to CD's; for the first quarter
the increase in such CD's was on the order of $1 billion, but not
all of this would represent funds formerly held abroad. In addition,
liabilities to nonbank private foreigners were probably reduced in
the first quarter, though data are still incomplete. Partly off-
setting this, liquid liabilities to international lending agencies
increased somewhat.
Weekly data for April on the over-all balancesare highly
erratic and inconclusive. The weekly liquidity balances do not
appear to be heading for a very large deficit for the month, while
the rate of deficit on the official settlements basis appears to be
somewhat lower than the high March rate.
U.S. foreign trade. The export surplus in March was
considerably below the very high February level, as exports
declined sharply while imports remained close to the February total.
For the first three months of 1970 combined, the export surplus was
at an annual rate of $2-1/4 billion (balance of payments basis), a
further improvement over the $1.4 billion and $1.8 billion rates,
respectively, in the third and fourth quarters of 1969.
Despite the pronounced drop in March exports from the very
high February total, it still appears that exports are trending
upwards. At the same time the rate of expansion in imports has

IV 5
slowed, although the absolute level is still higher than had been
expected with domestic production and consumption at present
levels. In current dollars, the ratio of imports to GNP in the
first quarter topped 4 per cent for the first time. Based on
previous experience a decline in the import-GNP ratio would be
expected to accompany a domestic economic slowdown.

Currently the major strength in exports is in nonagricultural
commodities, particularly industrial materials. Machinery exports
have also increased following a dip in the closing quarter of last
year. With economic activity in foreign countries still cyclically
strong, further advance in such exports can be expected. Agricultural
exports in the first quarter held at the high fourth quarter rate,
but with new crops now entering world markets from the Southern

IV -6
Hemisphere countries -- especially Argentina and South Africa --
it is questionable whether the current high rate of exports of
grains and soybeans can be maintained.
Exports in the first quarter totaled $40.9 billion at an
annual rate, balance of payments basis, 4 per cent higher than in
the fourth quarter. The entire increase was in nonagricultural
commodities, with steel, steel scrap, coal, aluminum and chemicals --
all of which had expanded in the last half of 1969 -- advancing
further. Higher prices for coal and scrap metal contributed to
the rising value of exports. Machinery exports, which were stalled
from August through January, partly because of the G.E. strike, rose
in February and March. In the first quarter, machinery exports were
running about 15 per cent above the average of the first half of
1969. Exports of civilian aircraft were also larger in the first
quarter than in the fourth quarter. Although deliveries of the
Boeing 747 to foreign customers, which started in March, are expected
to increase sharply in the coming months, these would be offset by
declines in sales of smaller, lower-priced jet planes so that no
further advance in the export value of commercial aircraft is
expected during the last three quarters of this year.
Deliveries of automobiles and parts, which had declined
from the third to the fourth quarter, fell again in the first
quarter, reflecting the weakness in automobile sales both in Canada
and in the United States.

IV -7
Among agricultural commodities, larger exports of soybeans
and cotton in the first quarter offset lower deliveries of tobacco
and grains. Commercial wheat shipments picked up but corn exports
have declined from the peak rates of the second half of 1969.
Imports in the first quarter were $38.7 billion at an
annual rate, balance of payments basis, about 3 per cent above the
fourth quarter 1969 rate. Purchases of nonfood consumer goods other
than automobiles (particularly nondurables) were up very sharply.
Imports of foreign machinery also rose, while arrivals of cars from
Europe and Japan held steady despite the weakening in total domestic
car sales. The value of imports of automotive equipment from Canada
was down, although it is estimated that 50 per cent of Canadian car
production is in compact cars, which are selling well this year.
In the first three months of 1970 sales of U.S.-type compacts
(including those made in Canada) and foreign cars combined have
accounted for 27 per cent of total domestic car sales, compared
with 18 per cent in the year-earlier period. The share of foreign-
type cars alone has risen to over 13 per cent this year; last year
it was about 11 per cent.
Buoyed by rises in prices of coffee and some nonferrous
metals -- nickel, tin, aluminum -- the values of imported foods and
industrial materials increased from the fourth quarter of 1969 to
the first quarter of this year. Increased imports of meat and
sugar more than offset decreases in coffee and cocoa.

The pattern in imports of industrial materials was mixed.
Imports of building materials, steel and iron ore were down sharply;
the drop in iron ore was from a high level after the end of the
strike at Canadian ore mines last summer. Imports of copper declined
by 25 per cent,all in volume. Other nonferrous metal imports
increased, both in quantity and price. Textile materials (yarns
and fabrics) were imported in increased quantities. Arrivals of
petroleum were also up, including large amounts of crude oil from
Canada in January and February before a Presidential proclamation
placed new quantitative restrictions on the inflow beginning March 1.
Foreign exchange markets. Strong demand for most major
foreign currencies during April was reflected in rising exchange
rates against the dollar and increasing reserves of some of the
major European central banks.
The German mark exchange rate advanced rapidly from
$.27316 on April 1 to its upper limit of $.27548 in trading on
April 22, the first time the rate had reached this level since
revaluation last October. The Bundesbank lowered its buying price
for dollars ahead of the sharply declining market rate for the
dollar and kept its total exchange market purchases of dollars
down to $115 million for the month. The strong demand for the
mark was generally attributed to continued tight financial
conditions in Germany. The 3-month interbank loan rate in Frankfurt

IV -10
currently is about 9-1/2 per cent -- where it has been since the
increase in Bundesbank rates in early March -- compared with about
8-1/2 per cent on 3-month Euro-dollar deposits. German banks are
unable to borrow Euro-dollar funds profitably because of a large
marginal reserve requirement. German firms, however, are large
borrowers of funds abroad.
Increased demand for francs pushed the French exchange
rate from $.18056 on April 1 to successive new post-devaluation
highs during the month, and on April 28 it was $.18108. The Bank
of France purchased an estimated $225 million in the exchange
market during April. M. Giscard d'Estaing, the French Finance
Minister, announced April 23 that France has now repaid all its
short-term debt to foreign central banks -- which had amounted to
$1,550 million.
Demand for sterling continued firm during April and the
Bank of England purchased about $260 million, down from an exceptionally
large reserve intake of about $800 million in March. The market for
sterling appeared little affected by the announcement of the March
trade figures, the 1970 budget presentation, and the discount rate
decrease from 7-1/2 to 7 per cent. Not surprisingly, in view of
the passing of the period of extreme tightness in London financial
markets due to tax collections, the net inflow of capital was less
in April than the exceptionally favorable inflows during March.

IV -11
The Canadian dollar exchange rate was at its upper limit
for most of April and the Bank of Canada purchased about $250
million in the exchange market. Demand for Canadian dollars was
spurred on at times by market rumors of an impending cut in
Canadian commercial banks' prime rate and of a change in the exchange
market intervention rate for the Canadian dollar. So far this year
Canada has placed $400 million of its reserve gains into non-liquid
U.S. Treasury notes.
The market for the Italian lira has been relatively well
balanced this month. Although the lira exchange rate has been at
its lower limit all month, the Bank of Italy has suffered no net
reserve loss through market activity.
The price of gold rose to a recent peak of $35.95 an ounce
in London trading on April 22, up from $35.33 on April 1. Reasons
for the recent increase are not clear. However, it is expected
that South Africa will need to sell increasing amounts of gold
during the rest of this year to finance its balance of payments
deficit -- which presently is relatively less unfavorable because
of seasonal factors.
Euro-dollar market. In line with renewed tightening in
U.S. money markets from mid-April, Euro-dollar rates rose substantially
in the last ten days of the month, and by month-end were about the
same as at the end of March. During the first half of April, Euro-
dollar rates had fallen sharply further, with rates on most maturities
reaching twelve-month lows.

U.S. banks' liabilities to their own foreign branches de-
clined by $364 million from March 25 to April 22 -- to about $12.2
billion. Foreign official CD's at U.S. banks' head offices fell
by roughly $150 million during this period.
Monetary conditions remain very tight in Western European
countries. (In Britain, however, short-term interest rates have been
adjusted downward in line with the Bank of England's rate reductions.)
Coupled with renewed doubts about the likelihood of further declines
in U.S. interest rates in the near future, market tightness abroad
has tended to stem the decline, at least for the present, in Euro-
dollar interest rates.1cEuDe

Payments balances of major industrial nations, Since the third
quarter of last year, changes in the payments balances of major industrial
nations outside the United States have been marked by the emergence of a
very large surplus-/ in Britain and by a rapid shift from deficit to
surplus in France. Net foreign assets of the monetary authorities of
these two countries increased by $2.6 billion in the first quarter of this
year. This was more than the $2.5 billion gain in official net reserves
in the first quarter registered by the Group of Ten countries (excluding
the United States), as shown in Table 1 below. The combined increase for
the G-10 countries reflected a balance of payments surplus for Canada as
well as the United Kingdom and France. It might have been still larger
in the absence of special transactions in Japan, whose balance of payments
surplus exceeded $2.3 billion last year.

1/ Surpluses and deficits are measured here by changes in net official
reserves and net foreign assets of commercial banks. In British usage,
a "balance of payments surplus or deficit" commonly refers to the balance
on current account and long-term capital.

IV 14
Britain's trade balance has strengthened further, and that of
France has improved in spectacular fashion in the wake of last year's
changes in the parities of the franc and the German mark. Both Britain
and France have also had very large net inflows of capital partly based
on confidence factors. Because the size of the mark revaluation improved
the prospects for maintaining the post-devaluation parities of the pound
and the French franc, funds that had fled from those currencies began to
return, a process given additional impetus as trade positions improved.
In both countries, monetary conditions have also been conducive to
capital inflows.
In both Italy and Germany the past seven months have been
turbulent. Italy, already beset by a heavy exodus of capital, suffered
a hemorrhage of reserves in January-February before registering a
surprising surplus in March. Explanations for these abrupt changes are
not yet very clear, but the recent rises in Italian interest rates are
now helping to curb the capital outflow. In Germany, the taking of
revaluation profits meant a massive outflow of funds in the fourth
quarter. More importantly, the heavy outflow of long-term capital that
had gone on for a year and one-half contracted severely in the first
quarter of this year as financial market conditions tightened.
It is likely that the British surplus has passed its peak;
April reserve gains were in fact on a smaller scale. Confidence factors
cannot produce a capital inflow indefinitely, and the current account
surplus is likely to decline, because of more rapid wage and price

rises in Britain, in spite of an anticipated improvement in the terms
of trade. In France, the maintenance of the improved trade position
will depend greatly on whether the authorities succeed in moderating
the still rapid rise in domestic demand. What course Germany's balance
of payments takes will be determined in great measure by the eventual
effect on trade of the revaluation, an effect that it is still too early
to gauge. Italy's large current account surplus should decrease further
this year, but a diminution of the huge capital outflow the rest of this
year may be expected to reduce the overall payments deficit. Canada's
overall surplus should recede from its present high level. There is no
indication that Japan's underlying surplus will diminish soon.
In the United Kingdom, gains in the net foreign position of
the monetary authorities in the fourth quarter of last year ($850 million)
and the first quarter of 1970 (estimated at $2 billion) were far in excess
of those in the first three quarters of 1969, as seen in Table 1. Britain's
current account has improved further. Last year the seasonally adjusted
current surplus increased from an annual rate of $220 million in the first
quarter to $1.30 billion in the third and $1.34 billion in the fourth.
It has probably been still larger this year. The surplus in the trade
balance--highly unusual for Britain--has increased in both of the most
recent two quarters despite a slowing in the expansion of exports.
Britain had a $450 million net inflow of capital in the fourth
quarter, all of it short-term. Confidence in the pound was boosted by
the mark revaluation, and this affected some short-term capital flows

IV -16
directly (such as commercial leads and lags and uncovered investments).
It also made covered interest differentials much less unfavorable to
Britain by nearly eliminating the forward discount on sterling, but
this is believed to have been a relatively unimportant factor. In the
first quarter of the current year, the net capital inflow increased to
an estimated $1.5 billion, presumably in large part of a short-term
nature. In addition to continuation of the confidence element, reasons
for this inflow were Bank of England sales of government securities to the
non-bank public, and bank credit ceilings in the face of high demands
for liquid funds, partly related to corporate tax payments. These
conditions led British firms to borrow from foreign subsidiaries.
Following the devaluation of the franc last August, France
had balance of payments surpluses amounting to $263 million in the
fourth quarter of 1969 and nearly $700 million in January-March this
year, as measured by changes in official and commercial bank net foreign
assets (shown in Table 2). Deficits in the six quarters from 1968 Q-II
through 1969 Q-III, a legacy of the events of May-June 1968, aggregated
$4.94 billion.
Improvement of the trade balance has been rapid since the
11.1 per cent devaluation of the franc and the 9.3 per cent revaluation
of the mark. In the second quarter of last year the trade balance was
in deficit at an annual rate of $1.2 billion (with imports on an fo.b.
basis), but a rapid return to equilibrium produced small surpluses in
December-February (and a larger one in March according to preliminary

reports). After devaluation, French exporters in nearly all cases did
not lower the foreign-currency prices of goods sold abroad, in part
because foreign currency prices had already been shaved in anticipation
of devaluation, and in part to reconstitute profit margins. The dollar
value of French exports rose at an annual rate of 15 per cent from the
second quarter of 1969 to February-March of this year, aided by rapidly
rising demand in most export markets. The trade balance improvement
has also owed much to a halt in the expansion of imports, the dollar
value of which was no greater in February-March than in the second
quarter of last year notwithstanding the continuing rise in domesticI -

economic activity. Import growth was slowed by the effect of devaluation
on the franc prices paid by importers; in addition, it seems likely there
has been some "living off of stocks" which had been built up to abnormal
levels in expectation of devaluation.
A large-scale net inflow of capital to France began after the
size of the revaluation of the mark removed the fear that a second
devaluation of the franc might be necessary. In the fourth quarter
France benefited from a net inflow of non-monetary capital estimated at
$600-700 million, largely in the form of a favorable shift in leads
and lags. This year, even though the shift in leads and lags has probably
contributed less of a gain in reserves, the net capital inflow has
persisted at a high level, responding to confidence factors and to
changes in interest differentials. While Euro-dollar rates were
declining, short-term interest rates in France were kept at the high
levels attained when the discount rate was raised to 8 per cent last
October.
French official net foreign assets rose by more than $500 million
in the first quarter, and the commercial banks' net foreign position also
increased nearly $200 million. In April, French reserves continued to
rise rapidly. According to confidential reports, the dollar deposits
which French banks were required to place with the Bank of France
during the early part of 1969 were reduced from $841 million at the
time of devaluation to about $240 million at mid-April; these re-transfers
reduce official dollar holdings but improve the banks' net foreign position.

IV -10
Germany's overall deficit of $6.15 billion in the fourth
quarter was in great measure a consequence of a $4 billion outflow of
short-term funds as speculators took revaluation profits and as earlier
shifts in leads and lags were unwound, a process probably not completed
by year-end. To these flows were added a $2.37 billion net outflow of
long-term private capital, more than twice the quarterly average in the
first three quarters. This increase in capital exports occurred primarily
because German banks fulfilled a large volume of prior commitments for
long-term loans.
The German payments position was close to equilibrium in the
first quarter, not only because the taking of revaluation profits had
ceased but also because Germany's exports of long-term capital began to
shrink rapidly as the authorities allowed the domestic boom and capital
outflows to tighten conditions in credit markets. The restrictive
monetary policy stance was substantially reinforced by sizable increases
in the discount rate and Lombard rate on March 6. Last year, the net
outflow of long-term private capital (German- and foreign-owned combined)
averaged $475 million per month; it held up in January ($550 million)
but fell to $190 million in February. In comparison with last year, the
February figures showed severe declines in portfolio investment abroad
by German banks and other investors, and in net loans to foreigners
(exceeding one year's maturity) by German banks and business firms,
but little change in the flow of German direct investment abroad.

IV -23
German trade figures in the months since revaluation have
reflected, among other things, the "perverse" terms of trade effect
of the parity change, i.e., a rise in the foreign currency value of given
volumes of exports and imports (allowing for changes in prices in terms
of marks). With Germany's trade already in surplus, the immediate
effect of revaluation was to widen the surplus still further as valued
in dollars or other foreign currencies. The adjustment of the volume
of trade in response to the parity change could be expected to take
some time, perhaps six to twelve months, but in the case of Germany
possibly even longer given the very large export order backlogs still
on hand. The full effect of the revaluation on the trade figures will
in any event be rather less than the 9.3 per cent parity change would
indicate, because of the partial de facto revaluation effect of the 4 per
cent border tax adjustments applying to German non-agricultural trade
from November 1968 until revaluation.
A distorting influence on the fourth quarter and January trade
figures was the imposition, from the time of revaluation until year-end,
of special levies on food imports from other EEC countries, which had the
effect of shifting some fourth quarter imports into January. In February
and arch the German trade surplus ammounted to nearly $4 billion, at a
seasonally adjusted annual rate. This was little less than the surplus
for last year as a whole.

IV -21
In Italy, where the balance of payments had moved into deficit
early in 1969 because of rising capital outflows, the further widening
of the deficit in the fourth quarter was quite limited despite the large
seasonal drop in tourist receipts. The deficit was favorably affected
by the unwinding of speculative positions in German marks and by a new
government program to expand foreign borrowing by state enterprises. But
in January-February the net foreign assets of the monetary authorities
and commercial banks declined nearly $800 million. Perhaps as much as
$250 million of this loss was due to seasonal factors. In addition,
first-quarter export receipts were reduced because of the strikes of
the previous autumn. Exports had been rising at an annual rate of about
20 per cent before the strikes, but they fell 7 per cent (seasonally
adjusted) from the third to the fourth quarter. Because about 75 per
cent of Italian exports are paid for with a lag, most commonly 90 or
120 days, export proceeds in the first quarter may have fallen $250 mil-
lion short of the levels that would otherwise have been attained. Capital
outflows financed by exports of banknotes, which averaged $188 million
per month in 1969, remained high at $203 million in January, but declined
to $150 million in February, possibly because of deliberate administrative
delays in crediting the accounts of foreign banks remitting the notes
from abroad.
A $76 million Italian surplus in March is as yet unexplained,
although one important known factor was a $200 million 5-year loan to
IMI, an Italian government credit institution, by a consortium of banks

IV -22
in Europe. This was the largest in the recent burst of foreign borrowings
by Italian state enterprises that earlier included several dollar issues
in the Euro-bond market for a total of $205 million from October 1969 to
February of this year. In March the outflow of Italian capital appears
to have been drastically reduced. Factors that could have led to a
reduction in this outflow included: 1) increases in interest rates on
bank loans and bank deposits which followed a rise in the discount rate
on March 6; 2) a further rise of 150 basis points in Italian bond yields
between December and March, bringing the total rise since May 1969 to
180 basis points; 3) new regulations which severely curtail the length
of time by which imports may be prepaid and repatriation of export
proceeds may be delayed; and 4) increased confidence in the lira
induced by rising interest rates and the formation of a new coalition
cabinet after a lengthy period of caretaker government by a Parliamentary
minority.
In the smaller European countries, the large surplus recorded
by Belgium in the fourth quarter stemmed from developments affecting the
trade accounts. The fourth quarter trade balance as measured by payments
flows was improved over a year earlier by $230 million, of which $120 mil-
lion reflected improvement in the balance on shipments through customs
and the remainder a favorable shift in leads and lags after the German
mark parity change. In the first quarter of this year, Belgium's
external accounts were apparently close to balance.

IV -23
The Netherlands also had a large fourth quarter surplus, in
this case in spite of some deterioration in the trade balance. Speculative
inflows following the floating of the mark at the end of September were
supplemented by increased net imports of long-term capital. In the first
quarter of this year the overall Netherlands surplus seems to have been
fairly small. In Switzerland, year-end swaps between the Swiss National
Bank and Swiss commercial banks reportedly totaled slightly under $800 mil-
lion and were the major reason for changes in the Swiss National Banks'
net foreign assets in the two affected quarters. Table 2 shows that
Switzerland's overall balance of payments shifted from surplus to deficit
in the fourth quarter.
The moderate improvement in the Swedish balance of payments
that began in the fourth quarter of 1969 continued during the early
months of this year. In the first quarter of 1970, Sweden had a balance
of payments deficit of $87 million, compared with a deficit of $132 million
in the same period last year. The Danish balance of payments, on the
other hand, has continued to worsen. Preliminary figures for the first
quarter of 1970 show a current account deficit of $160 million--a record
quarterly total for Denmark, which had a current account deficit of
$400 million for all of 1969. Excessive demand, as yet unaffected by
very restrictive fiscal and monetary policies, is the major factor
underlying this development.

IV -24
In Japan, where the balance of payments surplus doubled last
year, the surplus in the last quarter of 1969 was above that of a year
earlier. For 1969 as a whole, Japan's overall surplus came to almost
$2.3 billion, with the current account contributing $2.2 billion. A
small deficit in the first quarter of this year was in part because of
two special transactions; a $200 million 5-year loan to the World Bank
by the Bank of Japan, and an $83 million Bank of Japan purchase of U.S.
Export-Import Bank participation certificates. (These assets are not
part of the Bank of Japan's official reserves.) In addition, there was
some weakening of the current account in the first quarter, when there
was a $100 million surplus compared with $177 million a year before.
Little of this deterioration was in the trade account.
Strength in Canada's balance of payments continued in the
fourth quarter, bringing the overall surplus for all of 1969 to approximately
$550 million. Official net foreign assets, however, rose only a bit more
than $50 million last year. In 1969, an inflow of long-term capital,
mainly from sales of Canadian bonds in the United States and Germany,
more than covered a current account deficit and a net outflow of short-
term funds.
So far this year, the Canadian surplus has intensified markedly
because of an exceptionally strong trade performance. In the first
quarter, Canada had a seasonally adjusted trade surplus (imports f.o.b.)
of $560 million--unusually large particularly if compared with last year
when the trade surplus for the entire year was $617 million. Exports in

IV -25
January-February, up 15 per cent from a year earlier, benefited from
special factors affecting exports of crude oil to the United States
and exports of iron ore and wheat. Imports, which have shown no growth
since June 1969, were fractionally below a year earlier. It is expected
that Canada's 1970 trade surplus will show a proportionately much smaller
increase than the results of the first two months would imply, because
of the disappearance of the special factors behind the recent buoyancy
of exports.
There is some indication that in the first quarter long-term
security issues by Canadian borrowers in the United State s and other
foreign markets were below the year-earlier total of nearly $600 million.
Because of indications that Canadian banks substantially reduced their
net foreign assets in March, Canada's first quarter surplus may have been
a good bit less than the $300 million figure shown in Table 2 which omits
March data for commercial banks.

Appendix A: THE UNITED KINGDOM BUDGET FOR FISCAL 1970-71*
The British government acted on April 14 to ease slightly
both fiscal and monetary policy when it presented to Parliament the
budget for fiscal 1970-71 (which began April 1).
The budget projects a smaller surplus in 1970-71 than in
1969-70. The reduction reflects primarily income tax relief (mainly
for lower income taxpayers), a rise in the rate of increase of public
sector expenditures, and a switch from net intake to net outflow of
import deposits.
The principal monetary measures announced by the Chancellor
in the budget speech were a cut in Bank Rate from 7-1/2 to 7 per cent
effective April 15, the formal removal of the ceiling on bank lending
instituted at the end of 1965, and a liberalization of the target for
domestic credit expansion.
The principal rationale behind these easing measures was the
very considerable improvement in Britain's external position that has
been achieved in the last year. The basic balance of payments (the
current account plus long-term capital), which had been in deficit by
approximately £400 million (nearly $1 billion) in calendar 1960,
recorded a surplus of about £400 million in calendar 1969. In addition,
there were heavy short-term capital inflows toward the end of the year
and in early 1970. Consequently, Britain repaid vast amounts of short-
and medium-term external debt, reducing such liabilities from over $8
billion at the end of 1960 to less than $4 billion at the end of March
1970. Much of the repayment--about $2.4 billion--occurred during the
first quarter of this year.
Though fitting as a restrained celebration of recent accom-
plishments, the appropriateness or relevance of the budget and related
measures to future requirements may be questioned. The major problem
currently confronting the British economy is a very rapid rise in
wages, which increased at an annual rate of over 11 per cent from July
to January and are undoubtedly continuing to rise rapidly. The measures
announced April 14 will not check this wage explosion. In fact, they
give some further stimulus to consumption, by providing tax relief
primarily to those with a low marginal propensity to save.
The official government forecast which accompanied the pre-
sentation of the budget foresees an increase in real consumption of about 4
per cent from the first half of 1970 to the first half of 1971.

Division of International Finance.

In current value terms, disposable personal income will probably rise
at a rate not far below the rate at which wages are increasing. This
imolies--assuming no change in the savingsratio--a rate of price
inflation of 6 to 7 per cent, faster than the rate at which prices
are expected to rise in the United States and in major countries of
Continental Europe.
The nackage of measures presented April 14 did not come as
a surorise. With the necessity of calling an election within a year,
the pressures on the government to ease were formidable.
The Budget for Fiscal 1970-71
The budget projects a surplus for the central government of
£619 million--about 1.5 oer cent of British gross domestic product--com-
pared to £915 million in the year ended March 31. The oublic sector
(including local authorities and public corporations) is expected to
run a surplus of £244 million, compared with £598 millionin 1969-70.
The projected decrease in the public sector surplus reflects
in part an anticipated acceleration in oublic sector expenditures, which
are expected to be 9.2 per cent higher in the current fiscal year than
in 1969-70. The increase from 1968-69 to 1969-70 was only 5.2 per cent.
Refunds of import deposits will also contribute to the lower
surplus. Net refunds will total over £400 million in 1970-71. In the
last fiscal year they accounted for net receipts of £184 million. The
imoort deposit requirement, initiated in November 1968, was extended
beyond its olanned expiration date in November 1969, though the amount
importers were required to place with Customs was lowered from 50 to 40
per cent of the value of the goods being imported. In the budget soeech,
the Chancellor announced a further reduction, to 30 per cent.
Tax reductions announced by the Chancellor are expected to
reduce revenue by about £220 million on a full year's basis. Changes
in income taxes, affecting 18 million persons (2 millions of whom will
cease paying tax), account for most of the revenues to be foregone.
The most important revision is an increase in the flat-amount deductions
for both single and married persons, explicitly designed to benefit
primarily low income earners. The boosts in these reductions are to be
partially offset by raising the tax on the first £260 of taxable income
from 30 per cent to the standard rate of 41.25 per cent, but the two
changes together are expected to cost £175 million a year.

A -3
Other changes in direct taxation include a rise in the amount
of income from national insurance old-age pensions which can be exempted
from taxation. The amount of income exempt from the surtax also was
raised, from £2000 to £2500. This was the only move providing relief
for relatively high income earners.
In the one measure aimed specifically at encouraging capital
investment, the proportion of depreciation which can be deducted
immediately on industrial building has been raised for buildings begun
before April 6, 1972.
There were no changes in the corporate income tax, the selective
employment tax or in sales taxes.
Monetary Policy Changes
The cut in Bank Rate to 7 per cent was the second reduction
this year, the previous one--also of half a point--occurring March 5.
The Chancellor attributed the move to the downward movement in Euro-
dollar rates and to the strong position of the British balance of
payments.
The abolition of the ceiling on bank lending to the private
sector amounts mainly to acknowledgement of a fait accompli. The
ceiling--imposed in November 1960--called for the clearing banks to
reduce their loans--by March 1969--by about 4 per cent to 98 per cent
of the amount outstanding in November 1967. (Loans for specific purposes
of benefit to the balance of payments were exempt from the ceiling.)
However, loans never were reduced to the 90 per cent target and in March
were almost 6 per cent above the prescribed level. Since last October,
though, the banks' failure to comply had occasioned no punitive action
by the authorities, such as was taken last spring when the interest
rate on special deposits which the clearing banks must maintain with the
Bank of England was halved. (With the formal removal of the ceiling,
the normal rate of interest on special deposits--approximately equal
to the market rate on Treasury bills--has been restored.) The principal
reason why the authorities abolished the ceiling--and had been unconcerned
with enforcing it for the last several months--is the success of the
authorities in restraining overall domestic credit expansion through
holding down bank acquisitions of government debt, by means of the
budgetary surplus and sales of long-term debt to nonbanks.
The removal of the loan ceiling does not mean, however, that
bank lending will now be permitted to grow without restriction. First,
the Chancellor indicated that bank lending formerly subject to the 98
per cent ceiling should expand by no more than 5 per cent in the current
fiscal year. The new limit is less rigid than the previous ceiling

A -4
because it applies to bank lending collectively, not to each individual
bank as was true of the November 1968 directive. Second, the Chancellor
announced a rise in the special deposits requirement, from 2 to 2-1/2
per cent. This means that each clearing bank must keep on deposit
liabilities which it is not allowed to count toward the 20% liquidity
requirement. The increase to 2-1/2 per cent is probably not large
enough to slow significantly the expansion of bank lending and
appears to have been intended primarily as a signal to the banks that
they must continue to show restraint. An arrangement similar to the
use of special deposits will be applied to the non-clearing banks to
help control their lending.
The clearest indication that monetary policy is being loosened
is provided by the Chancellor's statement that domestic credit expansion
(DCE) may go as high as £900 million in fiscal 1970-71. In 1969-70 the
DCE goal was £250 million, and the actual result was some domestic credit
contraction. Domestic credit expansion is defined as the change in bank
lending to both the private and public sectors, minus the increase in
the country's net gold and foreign exchange reserves. DCE thus amounts
to a measure of the change in credit supplied to the domestic economy
by the U.K. banks plus credit supplied by the rest of the world (through
acquisition of U.K. official liabilities).
The main justification for easing monetary stringency, according
to the Chancellor, is to encourage capital investment. He indicated that
lending institutions will continue to be kept under surveillance to
insure that an easier money policy does not give rise to a disproportionate
increase in lending for consumption purposes.
Incomes Policy
The Chancellor deplored the recent wage explosion, warning
that the current rate of pay increases was unacceptably high. He gave
no indication, however, that the government was prepared to take
administrative action to slow wage rises. The government still has the
power to delay wage and price boosts for up to four months but has not
used this authority since the recent acceleration in wage increases
began. Nor, in an election year, is it likely to do so, despite the
virtual certainty that the rate of wage increases will not abate in the
foreseeable future.
Growth Goals
The official Treasury forecast which accompanied the budget
foresees a rise in real gross domestic product of 3-1/2 per cent from
the first half of 1970 to the first half of 1971. The Chancellor, in
the budget speech, estimated that, in the absence of the changes in

A -5
taxation, growth would have been only 3 per cent. The Treasury acknow-
ledges that 3-1/2 per cent represents a growth rate somewhat in excess
of the "estimated rate of increase of productive potential," which is
generally considered to be about 3 per cent. The feasibility of
greater-than-capacity growth in the next year depends of course on the
existence of unused capacity in the economy. The margin of unused
capacity is not large, however, and, in certain important sectors such
as production of machinery and equipment, capacity is thought to be
tight.
Exports of goods and services--with an anticipated rate of
growth of 4.3 per cent--are expected to be the fastest growing component
of GDP between the first half of 1970 and the first half of 1971.
However, this is much less than the 9 per cent rate of increase from
the second half of 1960 to the second half of 1969. Growth in personal
consumption is expected to accelerate, rising by 3.9 per cent in real
terms from the first half of 1970 to the first half of 1971, in contrast
to an increase of just over 1 per cent between the second halves of 1968
and 1969. Private sector fixed investment is also expected to grow
more rapidly than in the recent past, with a 4.1 per cent rate of real
growth predicted beteen the first halves of 1970 and 1971. Public
sector expenditures on goods and services, which decreased in 1969,
are expected to rise in 1970 but--at 2.5 per cent in real terms--will
be lower than the rise in GDP. The projected rise in public authorities'
consumption is 2.0 per cent, in public investment--3.4 per cent. A
steady increase in inventory accumulation is forecast.
Imports of goods and services, which grew in real volume by
only 1.3 per cent during 1969, are expected to rise by 6.3 per cent from
the first half of 1970 to the first half of 1971. Thus final expenditures
are projected to increase by 4.1 per cent in real terms, or by more than
GDP. The Treasury minimized the detrimental effect of this surge in
imorts on the balance of trade because of an anticipated improvement
in the terms of trade (with prices of imports expected to fall or rise
less than those of exports).
An interesting though unexplained feature of the Treasury's
forecast is a decline in the rate of growth in the first half of 1971.
GDP is expected to grow by 4.3 per cent (annual rate) from the first
half of 1970 to the second half of 1970, but by only 2.5 per cent from
the second half of 1970 to the first half of 1971.
