SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK
Nonfinancial
Industrial production and the labor market recently have
weakened further. But indications are that real GNP will show little
change this quarter, following an actual decline at an annual rate of
3.0 per cent in the first quarter. The shift in GNP is attributable
to inventory investment which is projected to have changed little,
compared with a substantial reduction in the rate of accumulation
during the preceding quarter.
Recent developments. Industrial production declined appre-
ciably in May and was more than 3 per cent below the high of last July.
Significantly, output of business equipment declined substantially for
the second consecutive month, although in both months shortages of
component parts because of the trucking strike were apparently a con-
tributing influence. Housing starts in May, as in April, were at an
annual rate of about 1.2 million units. Retail sales edged down in
May, following a large advance in April; for both months combined the
average was appreciably above that of the first quarter. Unit sales
of new domestic autos increased sharply in early June following some
improvement in May. April book value data for manufacturing and trade
seem broadly consistent with relatively little inventory change this
quarter on a GNP basis; indeed, the April data suggest some increase
that month, after allowance for price changes.

I 2
Weakening in the labor market was pronounced in May. The
unemployment rate rose for the fifth consecutive month and at 5.0 per
cent was at the highest rate in over five years. In contrast to ex-
perience of preceding months, the civilian labor force declined and
nonfarm employment was down significantly, although strikes accounted
for about one-third of the over-all employment decline. Reductions in
manufacturing employment were sizable and widespread by industry, and
the average workweek edged down further. By early June, however, initial
unemployment claims had declined to about the March level and insured
unemployment had leveled off, although at a relatively high level.
Wholesale prices increased at a modest pace from mid-April to
mid-May as a further advance in industrial prices at about a 4 per cent
annual rate was partly offset by a further decline in prices of farm
products and processed foods. The average monthly increase in in-
dustrial prices from December to May was only a little smaller than the
average from June to December 1969.
Outlook. GNP in current dollars is estimated to increase
appreciably more in the second quarter than in the first, and real GNP
is expected to change little following the preceding sizable decline.
The big difference from the first quarter is in inventory investment,
while private final purchases are showing about the same rise in the
second quarter as in the first. Consumer spending on goods and services
accounts for the bulk of this increase, and available data on retail

I -3
sales suggest that the rise may be about the same as in the first
quarter. The big bulge in disposable income arising out of the retro-
active Federal pay increase and the retroactive increase in social
security benefits was partly offset by much slower growth in private
wages and salaries and, in addition, there appears to have been a
sharp rise in the saving rate.
We expect a resumption of growth in real GNP in the second
half of the year, but we have again lowered somewhat our projection--
to an annual rate of expansion of around 2 to 2-1/2 per cent from the
2-1/2 to 3 per cent range of the preceding projection. We have shaded
down our projections of final purchases--which, however, still increase
appreciably more than in the first half--and inventory investment.
With stocks high and growth in final sales of goods slow, we envisage
only a very small inventory accumulation for the remainder of the year.
The latest Commerce-SEC survey of business intentions to spend
on plant and equipment supports our earlier view of a likely signifi-
cant shortfall from plans expressed in various surveys earlier in the
year. We continue to anticipate shortfalls in this and subsequent
quarters, even below the revised survey findings, with an outright decline
likely in the fourth quarter. This prospect, in our view, follows from
a variety of considerations, including recent declines in output of
business equipment, prospective further declines in profits, the high
cost and difficulty of external financing, and the continued relatively
low rate of capacity utilization of manufacturing.

I -4
With a smaller expansion in real GNP--and one considerably
below potential--more easing is in prospect in the labor market than
we had earlier projected. Some further decline is likely for
manufacturing employment, and increases in employment in nonmanufacturing
activities are likely to be rather small. Students entering the labor
force beginning this month may find job opportunities much more
limited than last year, and the youth unemployment rate may rise this
summer, at least temporarily. But with output turning up, the period
of most rapid increase in the unemployment rate--1.5 percentage points
from December to May--may be about over. We project the unemployment
rate at 5.6 per cent in the fourth quarter.
On balance, we are somewhat more optimistic than earlier
about the outlook for prices, allowing for the further easing now in
prospect in both the labor market and in the rate of use of manufac-
turing capacity. The GNP deflator is now projected to slow to an
annual rate of increase of 3.5 per cent in the fourth quarter. In
manufacturing, unit labor costs have been fairly stable this year, with
stepped-up gains in output per manhour about matching the continued
rapid rise in compensation. With respect to prospects for industrial
prices, it may also be noted that increased reports are heard of
discounting from list and that prices of industrial raw materials
recently have been moving downward. The rise in consumer prices should
also slow appreciably. Prospective food supplies continue to suggest
only a slight rise on balance in retail food prices to year-end.

I- 5
Costs of services are likely to continue to rise rapidly, but much
slower than the 11 per cent annual rate of increase of the first
quarter, when mortgage interest rates and transportation services
showed exceptionally large advances.
Financial
While the sharp deterioration of financial markets now
appears to be over, confidence remains fragile. Moreover, as in recent
weeks, the after-effects of the near-panic markets of last month will
probably be reflected this summer in some re-channeling of credit
flows. In May the rising cost of funds and market uncertainty produced
a sharp increase in cancellations and postponements of long-term
securities offerings, as well as a greatly reduced rate of increase in
dealer-placed commercial paper of nonbank issuers. As a result, some
credit demands last month were diverted to banks, where business
loans (including loans sold to affiliates) increased at twice the pace
of the January-April period. To help finance these loans, during a
period of limited deposit growth, banks sharply expanded their issuance
of commercial paper through their affiliates.
In evaluating the outlook, the staff believes that market
factors will produce only modest declines in interest rates this summer,
at best, and that rates could rise even further in the very near term.
If GNP fails to pick up in the third quarter as we have projected,
however, market sentiment could shift, with interest rates declining

I-6
more significantly over the summer than now seems likely.
Long-term security markets. Most recently, long-term yields
have again risen sharply, and the volume of postponements and
cancellations of scheduled issues in the corporate market have again
begun to mount. We expect the pace of offerings of corporate stocks
and bonds to continue to decline this summer, as a result of record
financing costs and continued stretch-outs and cut-backs in capital
outlays. Nevertheless, new issue volume is still expected to be large
by any standard other than recent months, and any easing of market
conditions could bring forth some of the considerable volume of financing
sidelined by high costs and market congestion.
Similarly, in the tax-exempt market very high interest rates
are expected to keep third quarter volume at the low levels of May-June.
Commercial bank demand for municipal bonds, particularly at large
banks, has dropped off to quite low levels in reflection of liquidity
pressures ond continuing uncertainty regarding the tax deductibility
of borrowing costs. Without increased bank purchases, little decline
in tax-exempt yields seems likely, despite the more moderate volume of
new issues.
Short- and intermediate-term markets. The continued demand
pressures in long-term markets are likely to spill over to short-term
markets, at the same time that Treasury needs for funds will be sub-
stantial. However, as the result of lender concern about credit worthi-
ness, some borrowers may find the commercial paper market less receptive.

I -7
Gross borrowing by the Treasury during the third quarter will
be considerably higher than in the record deficit period of 1967. Net
cash borrowing of about $6 billion--twice as much as in 1969--is expected
to be financed in large part by issuance of tax bills, as well as con-
tinued additions to the weekly bill auction. Both should add to interest
rate pressures in short-term markets, tending to maintain market rates
above CD ceilings. However, Federal agency demands for new money are
expected to decline to about $1.9 billion, or about one-half of the
first quarter pace, largely in reflection of reduced borrowing by the
FHLB System.
Bank credit. High cost and investor selectivity in short-
and long-term markets could continue to divert substantial business
loan demand to banks, and such demands should be buoyed by sizable
corporate tax payments in June and September. Banks have been liqui-
dating Government securities acquired in the May refunding, but the
July and August Treasury issues should produce temporary bulges in
bank portfolios, as banks underwrite the new issues. With business
loan demands large, these new issues are unlikely to remain in
portfolio very long.
Bank and nonbank interest-bearing deposit flows. If, as we
expect, market rates do not decline significantly, growth in time and
savings deposits at banks and thrift institutions is unlikely to
accelerate. Large CD's probably will continue to decline moderately
as slow growth at regional banks fails to offset attrition at banks in
money market centers. But, as in recent weeks, sluggish growth of

I-8
consumer-type deposits at large banks probably will be more than
offset by fairly rapid growth at country banks. With total time
deposit flows about maintained while loan demands are high, banks will
probably continue to rely on increased use of nondeposit funds.
At the thrift institutions, there is a reasonable prospect
that aggregate inflows over the third quarter will match the improved
second quarter pace. Interest rate differentials are likely to be
less probable to the institutions, but there seems to be some shift
in public preference toward saving in these forms. The outlook for
both banks and nonbanks for the June-July reinvestment period remains
uncertain, but outflows are not expected to be substantial.
Mortgage market. The expected quarterly growth pattern in
deposits at savings and loans and mutual savings banks implies room
for some further build-up in liquidity positions as well as some
pick-up in the depressed pace of mortgage lending. New commitments
increased in April, and we expect that the higher volume will persist
and perhaps improve in the months ahead.
Additional incentives to channel funds into residential
mortgages may develop if pending emergency housing legislation is
enacted that would subsidize FHL-Bank advances by up to $250 million,
give GNMA more flexible authority to purchase Government underwritten
loans under its special assistance programs, and provide a new direct
lending program for middle-income housing. Moreover, continued strong
FNMA support should help to lay the basis for some improvement in the
rate of housing starts during the second half of the year.

I-9
Balance of payments
Preliminary indications are that the over-all deficit in the
balance of payments was extremely heavy in April and May, despite
continuation of the trade balance--in April at least--at something like
its first-quarter level. In April the potential impact of the deficit
on U.S. official reserve assets and liabilities was damped by a rise
in Euro-dollar borrowings of U.S. banks. In May, when such borrowings
declined a little, U.S. official reserve assets fell sharply.
The April-May experience suggests that balance of payments
results for the full year 1970 may be even less satisfactory than
had previously been expected. But it is not likely that in coming
months the adjusted over-all deficit will run as high as the roughly
$10 billion annual rate of April-May. That heavy deficit was probably
a result of a bunching of various capital outflows. These outflows
included direct investment outflows to finance oil company taxes in
North Africa. They may also have included speculative flows into the
Canadian dollar and, as Euro-dollar rates rose in May, movements by
U.S. investors into Euro-dollars.
The April-May experience will probably also prove unrepresent-
ative as regards the means of financing the deficit. The United States
made some drawings on the IMF in May, but the May drop in reserve
assets was mainly in official holdings of foreign currencies (in
consequence of Italian repayments of swap drawings on the Federal
Reserve). The foreign currency holdings of the Federal Reserve and U.S.

I -10
Treasury, which stood at $2.8 billion at the end of 1969 and $2.0
billion on March 31, were down to $1.6 billion on April 30 and $1.0
billion on May 31. Later this year, to avoid undesirably large in-
creases in liabilities to foreign central banks, it will probably be
necessary for the United States to make sales of gold and SDR's as
well as further IMF drawings.

THE ECONOMIC PICTURE IN DETAIL
Domestic Nonfinancial Scene
Gross national product. Recent data suggest a GNP increase
in the second quarter of about $10 billion -- moderately larger than
the first quarter rise, and approximately equal to the gain projected
last month. Although a much smaller rise appears in prospect for the
deflator, this nevertheless implies a quarter of little or no real growth;
in the first quarter, real GNP declined at a 3 per cent annual rate.
The largest change made in the second quarter projection is
in consumer outlays, where available retail sales data suggest a
downward revision of about $1-1/2 billion. Consumer spending now seems
likely to just about match the first quarter rise; in view of the
exceptionally large gain in disposable income, this means a sharp rise
in the saving rate. In the April-May period, retail sales of nondurables
other than general merchandise and apparel were significantly less ex-
pansive than in the first quarter. In contrast, sales of durable goods
have shown more improvement than anticipated, but not enough to offset
the more moderate gain in nondurables. In addition, State and local
construction expenditures in April and May appear to have risen less
than expected earlier, and we have lowered by $ .7 billion our projection
for purchases of goods and services in this sector.

II -2
Small upward adjustments in other sectors largely offset these
downward revisions in consumer outlays and State and local government
purchases. Inventories are now expected to show no change from the
first quarter level instead of a slight liquidation. Auto output ex-
ceeded sales in May and current production schedules and recent sales
levels suggest little change in auto stocks in June.
Among other sectors, housing starts remain unchanged at a
projected annual rate of 1.2 million units, but residential construction
expenditures have been raised slightly, in part because of higher reported
average unit costs. In addition, the net export projection has been
raised to a $3.4 billion annual rate from the $3.0 billion in the last
Greenbook. This modification reflects some weakening of imports in
response to sluggishness of the overall economy, and slightly stronger
exports reflecting continued strength in foreign industrial activity.

The second half projection continues to call for recovery in
real output, although the rate of growth appears likely to be somewhat
less than we had formerly projected. We are now expecting an average
increase of about $14.5 billion per quarter in second half GNP as
opposed to $16 billion in our earlier projection; real GNP is now ex-
pected to increase at about a 2.2 per cent annual rate in contrast to
the 2.7 per cent in the last projection. The current projection assumes
expansion in the money supply at a 4 per cent annual rate, and in bank
credit at about a 7 per cent annual rate in the second half of the year,
and little change, on balance, from current interest rate levels.
The rate of inventory accumulation is expected to grow more
slowly in the second half than earlier projected as desired stocks
adjust quite gradually to relatively limited gains in final sales. It
also appears that State and local capital spending programs may continue
under somewhat greater constraint than we had formerly thought. With
the prospective calendar of Federal and private borrowings very large
and with no appreciable reduction in interest rates in sight, these
governments are likely to experience continued difficulty in bond
market financing, and we have reduced the projected rate of growth in
outlays by this sector in the second half by half a billion dollars in
each quarter.
Business fixed investment in the second half is now projected
as slightly weaker than in the last Greenbook. We continue to anticipate
successively smaller second and third quarter increases and now expect a

II -4
moderate decline in the fourth quarter. However, our projected increase
for the year as a whole is little changed. For a variety of reasons, it
is below even the scaled-down increase (7.8 per cent) indicated by the
Commerce-SEC survey. These reasons include low rates of capacity utiliza-
tion, lagging new orders, and current and prospective financing difficulties.
Continued tight money markets and high interest rates also
suggest that mortgage commitments will be somewhat less than expected
earlier, and we have cut back slightly our projections of housing starts
and residential construction spending. On the other hand, the recovery
in net exports is expected to be somewhat stronger than in the last
projection.

With a somewhat weaker overall demand situation, we now
anticipate that the unemployment rate will rise more rapidly than
earlier projected, although not as fast as in the second quarter.
Employment gains during the second half are likely to be minimal, but
labor force growth is also expected to slow reflecting in part reduced
employment opportunities. The unemployment rate by the fourth quarter
is projected to average 5.6 per cent rather than the 5.2 per cent shown
earlier.
But the second half outlook for prices seems a little more
favorable than it did earlier. Increases in wholesale industrial
prices this year have been slightly smaller than in the second half of
1969 and are expected to continue to ease in the second half of this
year. The consumer price index is also expected to rise more slowly.
Food prices recently have shown a tendency to stabilize and prospective
supplies suggest only slight increases later this year. Prices of
services -- especially transportation, medical care, and homeownership --
are likely to continue to increase at a rapid pace but not as rapidly as
earlier this year. The projected rate of increase in the GNP deflator
for the second half has been lowered slightly and it is now expected
to average 3-1/2 per cent in the fourth quarter, compared with 5.2 per
cent (adjusted to exclude the effect of the Federal pay raise) in the
first quarter of this year.

Industrial production. Industrial production declined .8 per
cent in May and was 3.2 per cent below last summer's high. Output of
consumer goods rose slightly, but production of business and defense
equipment and of materials were curtailed. As in April, some of the
decline in May must have reflected shortages of supplies and parts be-
cause of continued strikes in the trucking industry. Also, strikes in
the rubber industry accounted for .3 of the 1.4 point decline in the
May index.
One feature of the May decline was the second consecutive drop
in output of business equipment, down 2 per cent -- the same decline as
in April, Production of industrial and commercial equipment and air-
craft was down in May, but output of trucks rose sharply. The increased
output of trucks, as well as of autos, may reflect in part an attempt to
maintain inventories against the possibility of strikes when labor con-
tracts expire in mid-September.
Among consumer goods, auto assemblies rose 15 per cent and were
at an annual rate of 8 million units compared to 7 million in April. In-
dustry production schedules for June indicate an annual rate of about
8.3 million units. Output of household appliances increased further
in May, but production of furniture and television sets was off again.
Curtailments in materials production were widespread with
declines in steel, construction materials, parts for processing in the
equipment industries and indicated declines in textiles, paper, and
chemicals.

Retail sales. Retail sales, as well as consumer surveys,
continue to suggest cautious consumer purchasing attitudes. April
sales, however, were revised upward from the advance count and now show
a gain of 2.0 per cent, the largest increase since March 1968. Sales
in May, according to the advance (now unpublished) estimate, declined
.6 per cent; even so, the April-May average was 1.7 per cent above the
first quarter level.
Durable goods sales in May apparently declined 1.4 per cent
from April, as sales of the automotive group (which have a history of
upward revisions) were reported down despite a pick-up in unit auto
sales. Sales at nondurable goods stores were little changed, as slightI II I

Autos. Unit sales of new domestic autos increased further in
the first 10 days of June and were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate
of 8.7 million units. This was 12 per cent above the May rate of 7.8
million units, and only 1 per cent below the first 10 days of June 1969.
Continued sales contests at GM dealers were apparently a factor in the
early June results, as total GM sales were considerably above a year
earlier while sales of other makes were lower.
Dealers' stocks of new domestic autos rose 1 per cent from the
end of April to the end of May but were 3 per cent below a year earlier.
With the improvement in new car sales from April to May, the supply of
cars on hand decreased from 58.8 days to 57.2 days and was well below
the January 1970 high of 69.0 days.l

Consumer credit. Consumer instalment credit outstanding rose
$3.6 billion at a seasonally adjusted annual rate in April. The rise was
somewhat larger than in March, but less than the $4.0 billion increase
(annual rate) in the first quarter as a whole. Extensions in April were
a little below the first quarter rate and repayments were slightly
higher.
Auto credit and home improvement loans rose somewhat in April
following no change in the first quarter, but increases in personal loans
and other consumer goods credit did not match those of the winter months.
The April advance in auto credit was the largest since last November and
reflected a somewhat larger number of new and used cars financed and an
increase in the average amount of contract per unit financed. Average
contracts are still below earlier highs, however, even after the April
increases. In part this may reflect stiffer contract terms. Almost
80 per cent of sales finance company contracts for new car purchases in

quarter the proportion was about 78 per cent and for the full year 1969
it was 76 per cent. The proportion of contracts with dealer cost ratios
of 100 per cent or less for used cars has shown a similar pattern this
year.

Consumer surveys. The Michigan Survey Research Center and the
National Industrial Conference Board in separate surveys taken in April
and May found increased pessimism among consumers. The SRC index of
sentiment (composed of five attitudinal questions on consumer market
conditions, the economy, and personal finances) declined for the fifth
consecutive quarter, leading the Center to suggest that this may be the
longest consumer recession in the post-World War II period -- with no
turn likely before the end of 1970. In both surveys, there were fewer
favorable responses to questions on present business conditions and
employment opportunities.

II -13
On the other hand, both Michigan and the NICB found continued
basic optimism about past and future family income trends, and reported
intentions to purchase cars were mixed. The NICB reported a rather sharp
increase in the number of families planning to buy a new car within six
months, but Michigan reported plans to buy cars within the next twelve
months were off significantly. The six-month purchase plans should
probably be given more weight since forecasts for shorter time horizons
are usually more accurate.
The Michigan survey was completed before May 16 and thus did
not reflect responses to the worst of the decline in the stock market.
Nonetheless, most families were aware of the downward trend in stock
prices and thought it bad for business. Concern about a recession and
rising unemployment rather than the stock market, however, seemed to
be the main cause of their pessimism, along with worry about the high
level of prices.
Opinions about buying conditions for cars and large household
goods have not changed much in the last three or four surveys according
to Michigan, although evaluation of whether it is a good time to buy a
house continued to become more unfavorable and the NICB reported lower
home purchase plans. The NICB also reported lower purchase plans for
major appliances and carpets.

Construction and real estate. Seasonally adjusted value of new
construction put in place, which was revised downward by 2 per cent for
April, dipped further in May to an annual rate of $88.2 billion, 5 per
cent below a year earlier. Allowing for increased construction costs,
the year-to-year drop in real terms approximated 10 per cent, as estimated
by the Census Bureau.--

II -15
Within the private sector, residential outlays in current dolla
declined further in May from an already reduced April rate, but expendi-
tures for new nonresidential construction were maintained within 4 per
cent of the peak of last September. Although there has been some down-
ward adjustment in expenditures for industrial and commercial structures
this spring, outlays for public utilities and some other types of non-
residential building have tended to rise, bolstered by an exceptionally
high level of contract awards through April. Public construction outlays
edged down in May, reflecting mainly a drop in expenditures for Federally-
owned projects after an appreciable rise in April.

Seasonally adjusted private housing starts edged off slightly
further in May to an annual rate of 1.20 million units. The May dip
was associated with a 3 per cent upward revision in the rate originally
reported for April, however, Moreover, it was concentrated entirely in
multifamily units, and, regionally, only in the Northeast and North
Central states.
Seasonally adjusted residential building permits advanced
further in May to the highest rate in more than a year. In view of
the improved overall level of permits in recent months and other factors,
some upturn in starts is likely in June, possibly to at least a 1.25
million annual rate. If achieved, this would bring the average for the
current quarter to 1.22 million, a little higher than we have been pro-
jecting but below the 1.25 million average rate in the first quarter.

2/ Apart from starts, mobile home shipments for domestic use in April--the
latest month for which data are available--reached a record seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 445,000. This was 13 per cent above a year earlier
and nearly a fourth above the relatively low average in the first quarter
of the year.
Residential vacancy rates turned upward in the first quarter
from the low reached in the fourth quarter of 1969. However, the rise
was moderate and, at 5 per cent of the dwelling units available and fit
for use, the first quarter average for rental properties was no higher
than the reduced rate in the first quarter of 1969. Moreover, among
regions, rates in the Northeast and the West were below year earlier
levels and the lowest for any quarter in the history of the series which
began in 1956. While there was some increase in rental vacancy rates
in large metropolitan areas taken as a whole, the comparable average in

II -18
nonmetropolitan areas reached an historic low. Home-owner vacancy
rates -- a much less sensitive series -- changed little in the first
quarter at an average of 1.0 per cent. This compares with a high of
1.5 per cent in the first quarter of 1965 and a low for the series of
.8 per cent in the first quarter of 1957.

Planned spending on plant and equipment. According to the May
Commerce-SEC survey, businessmen have trimmed their 1970 capital spending
plans by about 2 percentage points ($1.4 billion) from those reported in
the February survey. Current plans now indicate an increase in total
dollar outlays of 7.8 per cent from 1969, rather than 9.8 per cent (revised).
Such downward revisions in spending plans are not unusual in
periods of declining activity. Over the past sixteen years, the Commerce-
SEC February survey has overestimated actual spending by an average of
2 percentage points. At economic downturns the overestimate have been
even larger. This experience suggests that if markets remain weak and

II -19
financing difficulties continue, there are likely to be further downward
revisions in spending plans as the year progresses.

The downward revision for this year as a whole was centered in
manufacturing and included both durable and nondurable industries. In
the durable goods area, large reductions from earlier plans were reported
by producers of primary metals, nonelectrical machinery, motor vehicles,
and stone, clay, and glass. Within nondurables, textiles, chemical,
and petroleum firms all reported large downward revisions. Most other
industries showed relatively small changes, except for food and beverages
which were scaled upward significantly.
A slight upward adjustment in nonmanufacturing resulted from
sharp increases in the plans of air transportation and utilities companies
which more than offset a decline in railroad plans.

II -20
As may be seen in the following table, the recent survey
indicates rather large increases in spending for the second and third
quarters and a slight decline in the fourth when spending by durable
foods manufacturers shows a sharp decline.

Inventories. Book value of business inventories rose in April
at about the March rate, and only slightly more than the modest first
quarter average. A fairly large April increase at manufacturers was
partly offset by inventory liquidation at trade establishments. Work
stoppages in the trucking industry may not have had much effect on over-
all inventory change but they do seem to have affected its distribution,
with producers' stocks of materials and components piling up while users'
and distributcrs' were drawn down.

II -21
When surveyed in May, manufacturers anticipated that the annual
rate of inventory increase (book value) for the second quarter would be
$5.6 billion -- greater than the average increase in the first quarter,
but less than the April rate. A higher rate in the second quarter was
expected by both durable and nondurable goods manufacturers, both of
whom also anticipated declined in the rate of inventory accumulation in
the third quarter.

The business inventory-sales ratio rose further in April,
owing both to the rise in inventories and a decline in business sales.
The sales decline was at manufacturers and wholesalers, partly offset
by an increase in retail sales, and may have reflected, at least in
part, the effects of trucking strikes. The ratio of durable goods

II -22
manufacturers' inventories to their unfilled orders, probably less
disturbed by the strike than inventory-sales ratios, continued to
rise rapidly to near-record levels in April.

Principal factors in the April rise in new orders were increases
in the primary metals and motor vehicles industries. Partly offsetting
these was a substantial decrease in aerospace orders, apparently reflect-
ing declines in both defense and nondefense orders. The capital equipment
group, which includes nondefense aircraft orders, declined in April in
contrast to an increase in machinery and equipment. A decline in "all
other durable goods" orders reflected reductions in construction materials.

II -24
Durable goods shipments dropped slightly further, with an
increase for motor vehicles largely offset by strike-caused declines
in steel shipments.
The durable goods order backlog declined another 1 per cent
in April, the fourth successive monthly decline of that magnitude.
The decline was mainly in the aerospace group, and occurred despite a
jump in unfilled orders for iron and steel. The decline of 4.4 per cent
in the total backlog since December is greater than the four-month
declines from the peaks in general activity of December 1966 and
May 1960.

Cyclical indicators. The Census composite leading indicator
for March was revised down by nearly 2 per cent, and the preliminary
April index is about unchanged from that level. The leading composite
in April was 3.6 per cent below its September peak and 2.8 per cent
below its November-December level. The latter decline is greater than
had occurred four or five months after the May 1960 business cycle peak.
Available May data for leading indicators show materials
prices, common stock prices, and the workweek down, while the initial
unemployment claims (which have an inverted effect on the composite)
fell back relatively little after their April jump.

The preliminary coincident composite rose to a new high in
April, reflecting the sharp jump in personal income attributable to
retroactive increases in Federal pay and in Social Security benefits.
The lagging composite also rose slightly.

II -26
Labor market. The labor market eased further in May, as
total nonfarm payroll employment recorded its first significant
decline in the current slowdown. The unemployment rate rose to 5.0
per cent from 4.8 per cent in April--its fifth consecutive monthly
rise and its highest level in more than five years. Declines in
manufacturing employment were larger and more widespread in May than
in other recent months and the workweek was reduced slightly further.
Moreover, employment increases in the service industries were more
sluggish and employment in trade declines for the second consecutive
month.
Probably reflecting the tapering off of secondary layoffs
arising from the teamster strike-lockout, initial claims for State
unemployment insurance have declined sharply and more than seasonally
since mid-April. However, insured unemployment has remained relatively
high since mid-May, at a level nearly 85 per cent higher than a year
earlier. The rate of insured unemployment jumped from 3.2 to 3.6 per
cent from April to May, the latter its highest level since 1964. In
early June, both initial claims and insured unemployment were moving
down somewhat.
Unemployment. Increases in unemployment in May continued
to reflect cutbacks in defense-oriented industries, aerospace, and
consumer durable goods industries. Rates increased among adults who lost
their jobs, particularly among white skilled workers in manufacturing
and construction.

Since December, unemployment has risen by about 1.25 million--
600,000 adult men, 425,000 adult women, and 225,000 teenagers. Of the
increase, 60 per cent were job losers and 30 per cent were recent labor
force entrants or reentrants.
After a substantial rise from December to April, the civilian
labor force declined by 320,000 in May, with all of the decline among
adult women; the labor force for adult men was still 650,000 above the
December level. The total labor force, however, continued to show a
very sharp rise from a year earlier--1.9 million as compared with a
"normal" rise of 1.5 million.
Nonfarm employment. Nonfarm payroll employment declined
by 270,000 in May to 70.9 million (new benchmark level), with about
one-third of the drop accounted for by increased strike activity,

II -28
mainly in construction, manufacturing, and trucking.- Most of the
overall decline in payroll employment in May reflected further
curtailment in manufacturing, which was down 225,000 from April and
700,000 from its September 1969 high. Declines in May were wide-
spread among nondurable and durable goods industries. Prior to
May, employment in nondurable goods industries had declined relatively
little.
Some of the May decline in durable goods industries--
particularly primary metals--probably reflected the impact of the
teamsters strike, but reductions in other industries mainly resulted
from continued cuts in defense and aerospace spending and little
real growth in consumer outlays. The latter factor was reflected in
employment reductions of about 10,000 in furniture, textiles and
apparel. On the other hand, employment in the transportation equip-
ment industry was little changed and hours of work rose here as auto
production picked up.
Reductions in the workweek were widespread in May with
manufacturing hours off 0.1 hour to 39.9, and overtime work down to
2.9 hours, the lowest level since the end of 1964. Over the year,
the manufacturing workweek has been shortened 0.8 hours, with
1/ The benchmark revisions increased the level for March by about
200,000, or 0.4 per cent; upward revisions occurred in services,
manufacturing, and retail trade; the level was reduced somewhat
in State and local government and wholesale trade. The revision
in the data to new benchmarks and the use of new seasonal factors
did not significantly change the March to April movements in
employment.

II -29
reductions of an hour or more recorded in 9 out of the 21 major
industry groups. The average workweek for rank and file workers in
private nonfarm industries as a whole inched down further to 37.2
hours. It has been gradually drifting downward since early fall for
a total decline of 0.6 hour.
In contrast to the September-May decline in manufacturing,
employment in the service industries increased 1.0 million during
this period; but employment gains have been sluggish since March.
Employment in the finance and service industries increased very
little in May. Federal employment (aside from hiring of temporary
Census takers) has declined by 107,000 since June 1969; but employment
gains have continued large in State and local government. Construction
employment has been relatively stable after allowance for increased
strike activity, and in May was down about 40,000 from a year ago.

II -30
Industrial relations. First-year wage increases in settle-
ments negotiated this year in manufacturing have averaged about 8 per
cent. The recent 34-1/2-month agreement between Goodyear and 23,000
rubber workers,which has been submitted to the membership for ratifica-
tion, provides an estimated average annual increase in wages and
benefits of close to 8 per cent. Since the contract does not include
cost-of-living increases at the end of the first and second years,
the wage increases have been spread fairly evenly over the duration
of the contract. This contract has already set the pattern for the
Goodrich settlement and is likely to do so for the rest of the rubber
industry. In apparel, settlements were reached in May for an addi-
tional 50,000 workers. First-year wage increases of 10 per cent are
followed by 5 per cent increases in the second and third years. In
construction, contract negotiations have provided first-year wage
increases averaging about 18 per cent. About three times as many
construction workers were on strike this May as a year ago and, in
a number of large cities, construction activity is at a virtual
standstill.
There is now hope that the trucking industry strike-lockout
impasse in Chicago will soon end. Some teamster locals are now voting
on a 45-month contract offering a total wage increase of $1.65. This
agreement provides 55-cents in wage increases effective in the last
6 months of the 45-month contract, in addition to the $1.10 in the
national agreement effective over a 39-month period. The $1.65
package would average out to about 9-1/2 per cent annually, as

II -31
compared with 8 per cent for the $1.10 contract over 39-months. If
the Chicago contract is accepted, the national agreement probably
will be renegotiated to conform with it.
Wholesale prices. The wholesale price index rose 0.2 per
cent from mid-April to mid-May as prices of industrial commodities
increased at an annual rate of about 4 per cent--roughly the monthly
average for the past six-months--and farm and food products registered
a further decline.

Increases for gasoline were a major influence in the increase
in industrial commodities and helped maintain the upward push evident
for fuels in recent months. Additional price increases for fuels can
be expected in coming months, especially for coal as new Federal health
and safety regulations and wage increases become effective in this
industry. Metals and metal products continued to show substantial
increases, as steel mill products advanced almost 1-1/2 per cent;
however, this rise was below the rates of advance posted last year and
early this year. Steel sheet prices were raised on June 1 for the
second time this year; earlier increases had been made last February.
The new increase will be reflected in the June index. Nonferrous
metals showed a marginal net increase in the May index, with prices of
some metals declining.
Increases in prices of metals and metal product are likely
to be smaller in the second half of the year, partly because of the
steel industry's current policy of not increasing prices of certain
steel products more than once a year and partly because of the improved
supply and demand situation for nonferrous metals. Price differentials
between U.S. prices and those on the London Metal Exchange have narrowed
recently for lead and zinc, and dramatically so for copper. Copper
scrap prices in the U.S. have declined about one-fifth since mid-April,
and this could also lead to reductions in brass mill products. A cut
in the domestic price for zinc, and perhaps for lead, also may occur soon.
Among finished goods, machinery and equipment prices have been
rising less rapidly in the last few months following an accelerated
increase in the latter part of 1969.

THE ECONOMIC PICTURE IN DETAIL
Domestic Financial Situation
Bank credit. Commercial bank credit, adjusted to include
loans sold to affiliates, increased at an annual rate of 8-1/2 per
cent in May--faster than in any month since November 1969. While
net additions to investments were sizable, holdings of securities
rose less than during March and April. But loans increased at about
a 6-1/2 per cent annual rate in contrast to declines in the two pre-
ceding months.

The May pick-up in loan expansion reflected principally a
spurt in business loan growth, following two months of sluggishness.
Some part of this growth probably reflected special factors attribut-
able to pressures in financial markets during late April and much of
May that may have induced some potential open market borrowers to

III -2
use bank lines instead. Rates on dealer-placed commercial paper rose
appreciably above the prime rate, and some borrowers may have volun-
tarily shifted their demands to banks; in addition, dealers reported
increasing difficulty in placing paper of lower-quality issuers who
--to some degree--were probably forced into bank credit. The deter-
ioration of equities markets generated a substantial volume of post-
ponements in the new issue market and this may have led to some tempo-
rary bank financing.
The aggregate of loans other than commercial and industrial
loans also rose in May at a rate above that in April, largely a result
of an unchanged volume of security loans in contrast to a substantial
decline of such loans in April. Consumer credit continued weak and
growth in real estate loans was the same as the reduced April pace.
Although banks acquired a substantial volume of Treasury
and other securities during May, growth in investments was substan-
tially less than the unusually rapid rate in April. In large part,
the May rise in Treasury securities reflected acquisitions of issues
in the mid-May Treasury financing, although banks liquidated Govern-
ments between the financing and early June. Acquisition of municipal
issues was cut back sharply--mainly at large banks--from the strong
March-April pace, reflecting concern over the IRS position on the tax
deductibility of interest, as well as pressure on the availability of
funds.

III -3
Liquidity of commercial banks--as measured by the ratio
of liquid assets to total liabilities at weekly reporting banks--
declined slightly in May after advancing in the month earlier. The
May decline was largely a result of banks selling off Treasury bills.
Overall, bank liquidity positions remain relatively tight, which
appears to be one factor behind continued bank restraint on lending
terms and conditions.l/
Monetary aggregates. The money stock increased at a 4.1
per cent annual rate during May, following the sharp rise on average
in the preceding two months. Within the month of May, the weekly
average of private demand deposits showed sizable swings but with
deposits at month-end about unchanged from those at the beginning of
the month. Partly this may have reflected unusually large fluctua-
tions in U.S. Government deposits, which declined more than $2 billion
from the end of April to mid-May and then rebounded in the last week
following inflows from the Treasury financing. Currency outside
banks surged upward at an extraordinary 15 per cent rate of growth
in May, nearly twice the rate in the earlier months of this year.
However, much of this growth resulted from a rapid expansion of
currency in late April and early May, and since mid-May currency
growth has been moderate.

branches in U.S. territories and possessions; and liabilities to
banks' own foreign branches.
Time and savings deposits at all commercial banks grew at
a slower rate in May than the rapid rate in April. Data for early
June indicate continuation of this reduced growth rate, with nego-
tiable CD's declining slightly as in May. The limited ability of
banks to attract and hold CD's in May principally accounted for the
reduced rate of inflow of interest-bearing deposits. Inflows of time
and savings deposits other than CD's continued strong as they have
been since February, although part of the April-May growth might have
reflected special factors related to the disbursement of retroactive

III -5
social security benefits and Federal employee pay increases. Most of
the recent growth has been at country (and nonmember) banks, where
expansion of time certificates and open account deposits has accounted
for over three-fourths of the increase. At weekly reporting banks,
where growth in consumer-type deposits has been sluggish, savings
deposits accounted for nearly two-thirds of the increase.

Nonbank depositary intermediaries. During May, seasonally
adjusted deposit growth at the nonbank thrift institutions is estimated
to have slowed from the April pace, but nevertheless to have continued
the high rates prevailing since March, rates well above those since
early in 1969. It is difficult to discern just what impact the stock
market gyrations during May had on savings patterns at the nonbank thrift
institutions. The intra-month savings data that are available--for
West Coast S&L's and New York City savings banks--suggest that the bulk
of deposit inflows was received during the early part of May. In fact,
New York City savings banks incurred a small net outflow during the
last week of May, which was coincident with--but not necessarily
related to--the dramatic stock market recovery. During the first week
of June, the New York City savings banks received a net deposit inflow
that was considerably smaller than in previous years.

Nonbank thrift institutions have been re-building their
liquid asset holdings recently. This build-up probably reflects both
their inability to acquire mortgages for immediate delivery and their
remaining uncertainty about the outlook for deposit flows, particularly
with regard to the reinvestment period that will begin at the end of
June. It is estimated that a large share of the increase in liquid
asset holdings has taken the form of Federal Agency issues.- The
impact of these acquisitions can be seen by comparing the traditional
liquidity ratios, which include only cash and Governments, with those
that also include other liquid assets.

III -9
In addition, savings and loan associations have reduced
sharply their net additions of borrowed funds and during March actually
reduced their net borrowings. During May and early June, FHLB net
advances continued very modest relative to a year earlier. S&L's have
reacted to the FHLB's subsidy plan for advances by converting the bulk
of outstanding eligible advances to the one-year minimum term (the most
recent indication is that 90 per cent of eligible advances have been
converted) but few have added to their borrowings under the subsidy
program. This experience suggests that those associations not utilizing
FHLB advances--some 2,000 in March 1970--have not been induced by the
subsidy program to become borrowers.
Savings and loans' mortgage acquisitions have been extremely
low. This reduced mortgage activity was probably as much a consequence
of a low volume of mortgage commitments available for immediate take-
down as it was an intentional build-up of liquid assets and reduction
in borrowing volume.

Mortgage market. FNMA apparently continued to play a major
role in the home mortgage market through mid-June, although there have
been recent indications that private originators have reduced their
reliance on FNMA support. Not only was there a further decline in the
volume of bids received and accepted by FNMA in the latest auction,
after allowance for the shift to a bi-weekly rather than a weekly

III -11
bidding procedure, but FNMA in May and again in early June negotiated
the sale of a few mortgages from its portfolio--the first sales in
several years.
Although data are not yet available for the current quarter.
FNMA's dominance of the home mortgage market reached a new high during
the first quarter, when private lender groups sharply reduced their net
loan takings. Under these circumstances, FNMA's net acquisitions of
home mortgages accounted for four-fifths of the curtailed net formation
of all 1- to 4-family mortgage debt on new and existing properties.l/
Considering only the FHA and VA subsector of the home mortgage market,
FNMA's net mortgage purchases amounted to more than 100 per cent of the
net increase in outstanding debt of this type.
In May as in the previous 3 months, the record level of
average yields on conventional home mortgages remained essentially
unchanged. Combined with restrictive downpayments, credit costs appar-
ently continued to act as a significant constraint on borrower demands
in numerous areas. Meanwhile, as returns on new issues of high-grade
1/ Federally underwritten mortgages also accounted for four-fifths of
total 1- to 4-family mortgage debt formation in the first quarter.
This share far exceeded the share of FHA- and VA-financed units in
total private housing starts, which was close to 30 per cent.
Aside from other unusual features of the first-quarter debt develop-
ments--when life insurance company disinvestment reached a new high
for the time of year--there are two reasons why the FHA-VA shares
of total financing and total starts may differ: (a) permanent
financing ordinarily occurs at a later stage of the construction
process, usually after completion and occupancy; and (b) debt
figures cover existing as well as new properties. In any case, the
results suggest that FHA and VA financing virtually preempted the
used-home market during the first quarter.

III -12
corporate bonds rose sharply, the relative investment attractiveness
of home mortgages to diversified lenders deteriorated. On conventional
loans, the net yield "advantage" dropped to a new postwar low of minus
55 basis points.

e/ Estimated.
Returns on home loans--especially conventional mortgages--
remained limited in part by usury ceilings of 8 per cent or less which
now prevail in 16 States and the District of Columbia. These areas
accounted for about a third of all residential building permits issued

III -13
last year. In the West where usury ceilings still pose no market
restraint, interest rates on conventional home mortgages edged lower
in May to 9.25 per cent.
In the latest FNMA auction, which has returned to a bi-weekly
basis, yields on 6-month forward commitments increased further to
within 6 basis points of the high reached early this year. The increase
reflected a further drop in bid prices, which was apparently a factor
that discouraged offerings to FNMA. Such offerings had remained fairly
strong over the past few months, in part because some bidders sought to
replace outstanding FNMA commitments obtained at lower prices with new
commitments carrying higher prices.

Life insurance companies. Funds available for investment in
capital markets by life insurance companies continued to be limited
during the first quarter, and at that time were projected by the
industry to remain low during the second and third quarters. Policy
loan increases continue to be the most dramatic drain on funds avail-
able for investment, but the diminution of other sources of funds has
also persisted. Return flows from mortgage portfolios, for instance,
were nearly $200 million lower during the first quarter of 1970 than
they had been a year earlier.

The most recent information on the net flow of policy loans
from a small sample of companies indicates that the volume of such loans
remains high. During May, net extensions of policy loans conformed with
usual seasonal patterns by receding from the bulge usually associated
with income tax payments, but they nonetheless remained at the advanced
pace of a year earlier.

Reflecting both the modest projections for funds available

ing those estimates, new commitment activity by life insurance companies
for future acquisitions of investments has remained extraordinarily low.
During May, the volume of new commitments made to acquire corporate
direct placements was about half of the already-reduced year-earlier
volume, but the average coupon rate approached the record high reached

Corporate and municipal securities markets. Postponements
and cancellations slowed the pace of new issues in May as yields on
both corporate and municipal bonds advanced to new postwar highs.
Encouraged by their relatively comfortable inventories and the apparent
easing of both current and forward supply after the pressures of an
exceptionally heavy April volume, underwriters priced new issues aggres-
sively early in June. However, the slightly lower yields met with buyer
resistance that forced new issue yields to new or near record highs in
the second week of June, which in turn led to additional postponements
and cancellations.

In the corporate bond market, institutional purchasers con-

were offered. On the municipal side, large money market banks, which
are a major support of that market, have been less active as buyers
over the past month. Individuals are still a key factor in both markets.
In general, an air of uncertainty and lack of confidence, re-enforced by
reports of large corporations with serious financial problems, continued
to exert upward pressure on long-term yields well into the month of June.
Even after borrower withdrawals, volume set a new record in
the public bond market in May, but new stock offerings essentially
disappeared in the last two weeks of the month. With stock volume
abnormally low, private placements apparently continuing at a depressed
level, and with cancellations of bond offerings in the public market,
the volume of total corporate security offerings in May was about $600
million less than the staff originally projected.

Because of the cancellations and postponements associated
with the slump in bond prices in the second week of June, the staff
now estimates that public bond issues will be approximately $1.6 billion
for the month, only slightly higher than the first quarter average. New
stock volume appears to have returned to a level just below the first
quarter monthly average; the level of new equity issues in both June and
July will be supported by an unusually large volume of stock issues by
public utilities, many of which are under pressure to improve debt/
equity ratios. Long-term debt issues of the utilities continue at a
record pace and there is a large backlog of industrial bond issues in
registration that were withdrawn because of market conditions in May
and June. The staff estimates that the volume of public bond offerings
in July will be about the same as June. The estimated June-July bond
volume represents a decline from the peak reached in April but is still
at least 10 per cent higher than any month in 1969 and 50 per cent
higher than the 1969 average.
New long-term municipal issues dropped off sharply in May as
the Bond Buyer index climbed past 7 per cent, the legal ceiling rate
for a number of State and local governments. As expected, the
California voters approved the increase in the State's ceiling early
in June and the State immediately sold $100 million of long-term debt.
But market conditions had caused cancellations of two of the largest
scheduled issues by Eastern states, and the staff now projects June
volume in the tax-exempt market at about $900 million. The July calendar
is building slowly and may not exceed the $1 billion mark.

III -19
The inability of State and local governments to sell much of
their backlog of authorized long-term debt in May and June contrasted
significantly with their experience in the first quarter of 1970 when
yields were declining dramatically. According to the Federal Reserve-
Census Bureau survey of State and local government borrowing anticipa-
tions, an unusually large number of units were able to sell more long-
term bonds in that quarter than they had earlier planned. These
accelerated issues aggregated $1.8 billion, much of it representing
sales of issues previously postponed in 1969. The revision of rate
ceilings by many governments undoubtedly contributed to this ability
to market previously postponed issues. The acceleration and rescheduling
of debt sales which was made possible by the first quarter municipal
market rally was offset, however, by shortfalls in other units, many of
which were still hampered by restrictive debt ceilings. There was still
a substantial dollar volume of cutbacks in construction outlays in the
first quarter of 1970. However, the increased volume of borrowing made
possible by the municipal bond market rally softened the impact of money
market conditions on State and local construction expenditures, as com-
pared with previous survey periods.

Stock market. Stock prices dropped sharply during April and
May, partly in reaction to declines in corporate earnings of greater
than anticipated magnitude but largely influenced by deteriorating
investor confidence in public statements regarding a near-term decline
in the rate of inflation, reduction of monetary restraint, and resump-
tion of economic growth. Investor uncertainty over the implications
for future foreign and domestic policies of the recent involvement in
Cambodia may also have had some depressing impact on stock prices. In
the two months ended May 26, the AMEX and NYSE indices declined 22 and
25 per cent, respectively, and reached lows about 40 per cent below
cyclical peaks of December 1968.

A developing "crisis of confidence" in the stock market--
which threatened further rapid declines in prices as well as the exist-
ence of a number of nearly insolvent brokerage firms--was at least
temporarily averted by a strong price recovery between May 27 and June 4,
when price indices on both major exchanges recovered about 30 per cent

III -21
of their loss in the preceding two months. Both the initial turnaround
in prices and the price and volume strength immediately following it
were attributed almost entirely to the activities of individual investors;
institutions--with the possible exception of pension funds--have stayed
on the sidelines.

Sudden reversals of a bear market decline have not in the
past been highly reliable indicators of a sustained turn in market
prices, but rather have signalled the onset of a period of "consolida-
tion" in which both price rises and declines--and perhaps new lows--
occur. Indeed, the market has retreated somewhat in recent days from
its June 4 interim peak, and volume has declined, on average, to about
half the level reached during the price rally. Three factors, however,
support the belief that a relatively sustained price rise albeit at a

III -22
more gradual rate than in recent weeks--may develop. First, earnings
declines appear already to have been heavily discounted. Second,
investor confidence may have been substantially buttressed by the
recent price recovery. Third, a rekindling of institutional buying
interest may be in the offing, adding to what is largely now an indi-
vidual demand; conversations of SEC staff with institutional brokerage
firms suggest that institutional buying may emerge as soon as there is
strong evidence that the market has reached its bottom.
Government securities market. Yields throughout most of the
U.S. Government securities list moved somewhat lower following the last
Committee meeting, as markets responded to the rebound in stock prices,
the System's active purchases of both bills and coupon issues, and the
lessening of the pressures that had threatened to disrupt all markets
just prior to the meeting. In the market for Treasury notes and bonds,
yields in all but the longest maturity category declined by 10-20 basis
points on average in the week immediately following the May 26 meeting;
since then, yields have tended to drift upward on balance, although they
remain below recent highs. Treasury bill rates, which also tended to
decline following the meeting, have continued to move lower.

At the end of May, political developments, the sharp and
prolonged decline in stock prices and the heavy calendar of new offer-
ings, together with an apparent retreat of investors from bonds, had
placed securities markets in a very fragile state. In order to restore
more orderly conditions in the Treasury market and to prevent further
price declines, the System purchased a total of around $300 million of
coupon issues in the two weeks ending June 8, nearly one-third of total
dealer holdings of such issues which, at the time of the meeting of the
Committee, were still swollen by the awards in the May financing. As a

III -24
result of these actions, prices of Treasury securities moved up,
investor interest improved, and dealers were able to make further
moderate sales of coupon issues to the market.

With a steadier tone in the money market, and Federal funds
trading consistently around the 8 per cent level, demand in the bill
market picked up. At the same time dealers were somewhat less restive
with their positions, and consequently rates declined. A further result
of these developments was an increased interest by professionals and
others as well in the weekly bill auctions and a much narrower spread

III -25
between average and stop-out issuing rates. But, as in the note and
bond sector of the market, the improvement in the bill market was also
aided by outright System purchases of bills (which totaled nearly $1.0
billion in the three weeks ending June 15), by a large volume of repur-
chase agreements, and by sizable foreign official demands for bills.
In contrast to Treasury issues, yields on Federal agency
securities have shown very little change since late May and have in
some instances moved higher. These yield changes occurred despite a
considerable reduction in agency borrowing in May and June, both from
the standpoint of the level in earlier months and from earlier estimates
of borrowing in May and June. In May, for example, actual new borrowing
of the major agencies (excluding GNMA) was only $345 million, about half
of earlier estimates. In June the amount of net new cash raised seems
likely to be around $200 million, less than 20 per cent of that estimated
at the beginning of the quarter. The major reason for this drop-off in
agency borrowing is the sharp reduction in new money needs by the Home
Loan Banks as advances to member institutions have tended to recede.
Other short-term credit markets. During late May and early
June, interest rates on private short-term securities have shown mixed
changes. Finance paper rates have remained unchanged and bankers'
acceptances have declined 25 basis points. However, in the commercial
paper market, where investors are said to be placing a greater stress
on quality in the wake of the Penn Central Railroad difficulties, rates
have risen. The increase in 3- and 6-month commercial paper rates by

III -26
1/8 of a per cent to a level of 8.25 per cent may also be attributable
to the large increase in outstanding commercial paper--particularly
bank-related paper. Outstanding bank-related paper (seasonally unad-
justed) rose some $920 million, or 14 per cent, in the four weeks
ending May 27, the largest monthly gain since January 1970. The latest
data for commercial paper of other issuers is for April, when there was
a substantial net increase. Preliminary weekly data for May suggest a
considerable slowing in the growth of such other commercial and finance
paper since April, primarily the result of the decline in the rate of
issuance of directly placed paper.

Federal Finance. The Board staff is currently projecting a
$3.4 billion deficit in the unified budget for fiscal 1970 compared to
the $1.8 billion deficit forecast by the Administration in its May 19
budget revisions. The difference occurs entirely in estimates of
receipts; the Administration's revised estimate of budget outlays for
the current fiscal year, $198.2 billion, seems to be consistent with
current developments and is accepted by the staff.
Turning to fiscal 1971, the staff now projects a budget defi-
cit of $7.3 billion--about $6.0 billion higher than the deficit forecast
by the Administration in May. Because of its lower income assumptions
and because the staff assumes a later effective date for implementation
of the proposed tax on lead in gasoline, the staff estimate of fiscal
1971 receipts is about $4.0 billion lower than the revised Administra-
tion estimate. Staff estimates of fiscal 1971 expenditures are about
$2.0 billion higher than projected by the Administration mainly because
the staff estimates include and the Administration estimates exclude a
5 per cent social security benefit hike in January and certain social
security reform measures that have been approved by the House and that
have received at least partial support by the Administration. No
revisions have been made by the staff in the Budget Bureau's January
estimate of defense outlays in fiscal 1971. Both staff and Administra-
tion estimates assume an early hike in postal rates during the coming
year; there are, however, some indications that the rate increase may
be postponed.

II -29
In terms of the NIA fiscal concepts, the staff continues to
project a small surplus in fiscal 1970 ($1.2 billion) with the last half
of the fiscal year showing a deficit at an annual rate of $4.7 billion.
While the continuing quarterly shift toward deficit in the Federal
Sector account is expected to be reversed, gradually, beginning in the
third quarter of calendar 1970, for calendar 1970 and for fiscal 1971
the deficit in the Federal Sector is expected to be about $6.0 billion.
The staff forecast of the high employment surplus indicates
that the shift toward deficit in the Federal Sector account is to a
considerable extent the result of low levels of projected economic growth
rather than discretionary changes in fiscal policy. The staff's estimate
indicates that the high employment surplus will increase from $4.6 billion
to $15.5 billion from the first to second half of fiscal 1971. Thus the
budget is expected to become more restrictive as the fiscal year pro-
gresses despite the discretionary increases in spending included in the
staff estimate. The move toward restriction during the January-June
1971 period only partially reflects the proposed tax on lead in gasoline
(staff estimate of $1,2 billion) and the speed-up in estate and gift taxes
($1.5 billion); the remainder is largely the result of the scheduled hike
in social security taxes, which will yield $5.8 billion at annual rates,
and of the increased revenue throwoff normally expected to result from
economic growth.
The Treasury's cash balance at the end-of-June is projected by
the staff to be $7.8 billion. During the third quarter the Treasury is
expected to raise about $8.0 to $9.0 billion of new money. The precise

III -30
timing of this cash financing has not been specified, but around $1
billion of the need may be met through continuation of the $100 million
additions to weekly bill auctions. The additional July need of $3.5 to
$4,5 billion may be financed in one installment, payable in the third
week, or in two smaller installments, one very early in the month and the
other just prior to the August refinancing. Depending on the size of the
July new money financing, cash borrowing in August may occur as a part of
the refinancing or in a separate borrowing late in the month. Publicly
held notes and bonds to be refinanced in August totaled $5.6 billion.
Gross Treasury borrowing in the third quarter of 1970 is thus expected
to be somewhat larger than in recent years.

THE ECONOMIC PICTURE IN DETAIL
International Developments
U.S. balance of payments. Preliminary and partial data for
April and May indicate very large liquidity deficits in those months --
between $3/4 and $1 billion in each month, roughly seasonally adjusted
and before special transactions. In the first quarter, monthly deficits
on this basis averaged about $500 million.
The deficit on the official settlements basis declined sharply
in April and rose sharply again in May. The difference between this
pattern and that of the liquidity balance reflected a swing in borrow-
ings by U.S. banks from their foreign branches. In April U.S. banks
increased their liabilities to their foreign branches by $700 million;
in May such liabilities were reduced by about $200 million.
The worsening of the liquidity balance in April and May is
not ascribable to changes in merchandise trade or in other payments
or receipts for which monthly data or estimates exist. It seems likely
that outflows of U.S. capital -- other than purchases of foreign sec-
urities or foreign lending by U.S. banks -- were unusually large in
these months. Direct investment outflows to finance oil company tax
payments to Libya were apparently much larger in April this year than
in April 1969. In May there may have been speculative outflows of U.S.
funds to Canada, in anticipation of some such changes in the Canadian

IV -2
dollar exchange rate as actually occurred at the beginning of June
(see page IV -8 below). Also, the renewed rise in Euro-dollar
interest rates in May (page IV -7 ) may have attracted U.S. private
investment funds.
Monthly data on securities transactions do not help to
explain the adverse shift in the deficit. U.S. purchases of foreign
securities in April were smaller than in February and March, and
May purchases are estimated to have been even smaller. There were
net foreign purchases of U.S. stocks in April (only $8 million) for
the first time this year, following net sales in each of the first
three months. Probably there were again net sales by foreigners in
the first part of May when the U.S. stock market dropped sharply, but
data are not available. Foreign buying of new U.S. corporate issues
in the Euro-bond market was already low in the first quarter and
there does not seem to have been any appreciable further decline in
April and May.
Additional information on the first-quarter balance of
payments -- confidential until the June Survey of Current Business
is released after June 25 -- indicates that the net outflow of U.S.
corporate capital (net of U.S. corporate borrowing abroad) was un-
usually large in the January-March period. Seasonal adjustments
have been revised to take some account of the tendency that has
developed under the OFDI controls in the past two years toward year-end

IV -3
repatriations followed by large outflows early in the year. After
the revised seasonal adjustments, the gross U.S. direct investment
outflow will be reported as $1.3 billion in the first quarter of
1970, compared with $0.9 billion in the corresponding period a
year ago and a 1969 quarterly average of $0.8 billion. A high level
of direct investment outflow is to be expected this year in view of
heavy programmed plant and equipment expenditures abroad; the latest
interagency committee forecast for 1970 is in fact $3.8 billion, or
a quarterly average of $850 million. But the underlying trend is
clearly overstated by the first-quarter figure of $1.3 billion,
which follows a revised fourth-quarter seasonally adjusted outflow
of only $0.3 billion.
U.S. direct investors have been finding it more difficult
to raise funds abroad this year. Euro-bond issues to finance direct
investments had exceeded $2 billion in 1968 and were about $1 billion
in 1969. In the first quarter of 1970 such issues were only about
$150 million. (The inter-agency projection assumes a recovery later
in the year, to give a $900 million total for 1970).
The detailed balance of payments data show that net un-
recorded payments (errors and omissions) dropped to about $350 million
in the first quarter, compared with $2.9 billion in the year 1970
(a $750 million quarterly average). The drop suggests that there was
no very large flow of funds to the Euro-dollar market in the first
three months.

IV -4
There was a record inflow of foreign direct investment into
the United States in the first quarter -- $462 million. The bulk of
this inflow was the result of a single new investment by British
Petroleum into SOHIO. However, its favorable impact on the balance
of payments was offset in large part by an increase in related U.S.
long-term corporate claims on foreigners.
U.S. foreign trade. The export surplus edged upward in
April from its relatively low March level as exports rose more than
imports. The surplus in the three months through April, including
a large surplus in February, was at an annual rate of about $2-3/4
billion, balance of payments basis, compared with the $1-1/2 billion
rate in November-January.
The April data further strengthen the impression that imports
have been levelling off. The level of imports remains high, but
month-to-month variations in the last three months have been small.
Exports have displayed a more erratic monthly movement than imports,
but on average they have shown a steady upward movement. The U.S.
share of world exports, both for all commodities and for manufactured
goods alone, was higher in the first quarter than the low strike-
affected share in 1969 but still remains less than in the 1966-68
period.
Exports in February-April were at an annual rate of $41.3
billion (balance of payments basis), over 5 per cent higher than in
the preceding three months, November-January.

IV -5
Among agricultural commodities, larger shipments of wheat,
cotton and soybeans more than offset a sizable decline in feed
grains. The stabilization of world wheat prices and more competitive
pricing of U.S. wheat have been cited as reasons for the pickup in
wheat exports. The increase in cotton exports stems from greater
shipments under Government programs -- P.L. 480, barter, and increased
credits by the Export-Import Bank and the Commodity Credit Corporation.
Exports of soybeans, which have been at record levels in the crop year
beginning last September, are now expected to increase even further as
the projected expansion in supplies of foreign competing oils has not
been realized. Unfavorable weather conditions in Europe, the effects
of the earthquake in Peru, and the restrictions on exports of sunflower-
seed oil by Argentina to hold domestic prices down, have resulted in a
world shortage of fats and oils. All in all, the chances that exports
of agricultural commodities may continue at the present high level are
considerably stronger than was previously thought.
Among nonagricultural exports, commercial aircraft and
industrial materials (coal, steel, ferrous scrap, aluminum) continued
to lead the expansion. Shipments of machinery in February-April were
higher than in November-January; April shipments, however, fell from
the high levels of the preceding two months.
By areas, the largest gains in February-April were recorded
in shipments to Europe, Japan and Latin America.

IV -6
Imports in this period were at annual rate of $38.5 billion,
balance of payments basis -- 1-1/2 per cent higher than in November-
January. Imports of foods, machinery, automobiles and other consumer
goods increased. Except for petroleum and chemicals, imports of
industrial materials declined slightly.
Heavy arrivals of meat and fish were the major items account-
ing for the increased value of food imports. Higher prices of coffee
sustained the import value of that commodity. The gains in consumer
goods were scattered, and included radio and TV sets, footwear and
furniture. Particularly impressive was the one-third increase in
imports of European and Japanese cars. Sales of these cars advanced
sharply in May; for the first five months of the year sales averaged
an annual rate of nearly 1.3 million units. This compares with 1.1
million units in calendar 1969. With sales of domestically-produced
cars down, the share of European and Japanese cars in the U.S. auto-
mobile market is now nearly 13-1/2 per cent, up substantially from
the 11 per cent of last year.
Euro-dollar market. Euro-dollar interest rates rose fairly
sharply between mid-May and mid-June. Rate increases were smallest
for very short maturities. The three-month deposit rate at mid-June
was about 1 percentage point higher than a month earlier.

Liabilities of U.S. banks to their own foreign branches have
fluctuated considerably in the past three months. Between month-ends
they rose about $700 million in April and declined about $200 in May.
The Wednesday data, however, were at their lowest on April 22, and
were again relatively low at May 13. From May 13 to June 10, they
increased, net, by over $300 million, to $12.6 billion (including loan
participations sold).
The sharp increase in Euro-dollar rates in the face of only
a moderate change in U.S. banks' liabilities to branches is chiefly
attributable to very tight financial markets in European countries.
German banks and businesses were reported to be borrowing large
amounts in international money markets during the period mid-May to
mid-June. The inflow of short-term capital to Canada in May, preceding
the floating of the Canadian dollar, may also have played some role in
tightening international money markets.

IV -8
Foreign exchange markets. The major development in foreign
exchange markets since the last Green Book (May 20) was the build-up
of strong demand for the Canadian dollar in late May, which culminated
in the Canadian Government's decision to allow the exchange rate to
float beginning June 1. This action tended to unsettle exchange
markets and in particular stimulated demand for the German mark and
Dutch guilder.
The Canadian dollar exchange rate -- which had been pressing
against its upper limit of 93.24 U.S. cents all year -- was quoted
in very early trading in London on June 1 as high as (U.S.) $1.00,
apparently reflecting strong demand for Canadian dollars to cover
short positions. The Bank of Canada purchased (U.S.) $30 million in
the London market (sold Canadian dollars) to moderate the Canadian
rate increase. Trading opened in New York at about 97.75 U.S. cents
and the Bank of Canada entered the market at 96.50 cents, buying
$116 million of U.S. dollars before moving its intervention rate to
97.50 cents, at which rate it made no purchases.
Since June 1, trading in the Canadian dollar has been
generally quiet. The exchange rate stayed within a narrow range
between 96.5 U.S. cents and 97.0 U.S. cents during the rest of the
first week of June, and the Bank of Canada did not intervene on
any significant scale. The rate dropped continuously during the
second week, to 95.8 U.S. cents on June 12. The Bank of Canada --
following its announced policy of intervening to moderate movements

IV -9
of the rate in either direction -- sold (U.S.) $20 million net. So
far during the current week the Canadian exchange rate has held within
a range of about 95.55 to 95.70 U.S. cents, and the Bank of Canada has
not been active in the market.
Demand for the German mark continued strong in late May.
Following the Canadian decision to float, the mark rate was pushed to
its upper limit. So far in June the Bundesbank has purchased $933
million in the exchange market ($640 million was purchased on one day,
June 10). The mark's strength is generally attributed to inflows of
funds partly in response to tight domestic credit markets and partly
reflecting nervousness over the possibility of further departures from
existing parities for strong currencies such as the German mark. On
June 15 the Bundesbank began offering 3-month forward marks, at rates
slightly below the market premium with the intention of reassuring the
market of the stability of the current parity.
Sterling has come under moderate selling pressure from time
to time since mid-May, and the exchange rate fell from about $2.405
on May 15 to its current level around 2.3965. The Government's May 18
announcement of elections to be held on June 18 produced moderate
selling pressure. Greater selling pressure developed shortly thereafter
as short-term funds moved out of sterling, apparently in response to
the attractive yields in the Euro-dollar market. The sterling rate
dropped below $2.40 on June 1 in the wake of the Canadian move and

IV -10
moved sharply lower on June 15 in response to announcement of a
larger foreign trade deficit for May. During each of these selling
episodes the Bank of England has kept its dollar sales at a minimum,
allowing the exchange rate to take most of the pressure. It supplied
$125 million in late May and came out about even in its market trans-
actions for May as a whole, thus bringing to an end a four-month streak
of continuous and exceptionally large reserve gains since the beginning
of the year.
On May 15 the United States drew $150 million of Dutch guilders
and Belgian francs from the IMF to help repay outstanding drawings on
the Netherlands Bank and the National Bank of Belgium. So far in
June, demand for the Dutch guilder has led the Netherlands Bank to
intervene in the market to purchase about $35 million. On the other
hand, labor strife and uncertainty over regional elections in Italy
were the occasion for increased selling pressure on the Italian lira,
and the Bank of Italy so far in June has sold $180 million. Heavy
selling of forward lire has at times caused a very wide discount to
develop. On June 11 the Bank of Italy drew $100 million on its swap
line with the System, raising outstanding drawings to $300 million.
Previously, Italian reserve gains in May had permitted the Bank of
Italy to repay $600 million on its Federal Reserve swap drawings
during May.

IV -11
Inflationary pressures in major industrialized countries.
Strong inflationary pressures prevail in all the industrialized countries.
The severity of these pressures, however, and, more importantly, the
nature of the inflation--whether cost-push or demand-pull--varies
considerably. Demand pressures remain very strong in Germany, but may
have begun to moderate under the influence of the restrictive credit
policy and the lagged effects of the revaluation, Labor costs are
rising sharply. Demand pressures are also strong in France, Belgium,
the Netherlands, and Japan. Although they may ease somewhat in Belgium
and perhaps also in Japan, they are likely to persist through this
year. At the same time, costs have begun to reflect the high induced
demand for labor, introducing a significant and increasing cost-push
element in all these countries.
Cost-push factors have been predominant in the United Kingdom,
and this is now the case in Italy as well. In spite of some unemployment,
wages in the United Kingdom have accelerated sharply--far in excess of
productivity gains. Labor costs also have risen extremely sharply in
Italy--again, much faster than labor productivity. Strong internal demand
and higher costs for imported materials contributed to price acceleration
in Italy in 1969, but wage-push is now the over-riding factor.
In Canada, the excessive demand pressures--including those
from outside--which initiated the inflationary process in that country
seem to be moderating. But labor costs are advancing rapidly,

IV -12
One consolation for policy-makers in each of the industrialized
countries is that the impact of the inflation on its external balance
is mitigated by the fact that inflation is also strong in its trade
partners. In all these nations the authorities are nevertheless
struggling to contain price increases. The policy problem is probably
most acute in Britain, where unemployment has been high for that country
and real income has been depressed since 1967. Some kind of an incomes
policy seems required (and, in the longer run, policies to increase.
productivity), but the Labour Party has so far been reluctant. Chances
for the implementation of such a policy may improve after the June 18
election, unless neither party wins a comfortable majority.
In other countries, where demand pressures still play a greater
role, a continuation of fairly tight monetary and fiscal policy must
be expected.
The rate of price inflation in Germany--which had been particularly
sharp in the final quarter of 1969 and the early months of this year--has
been lower in recent months, but some Germany officials believe that
prices may again rise at a faster pace. Demand pressures after the
revaluation have remained very strong, and the labor market continues
extremely tight despite the fact that the number of foreign workers in
Germany has risen from around 1.1 million at the beginning of 1969 to
1.7 million (7.6 per cent of the work force) in March 1970.

IV -13
Unit labor costs, which had remained virtually stable from
the end of 1967 through the middle of last year, rose sharply after large
wage increases were negotiated in September--particularly in the coal and
steel sectors; it is expected that they will continue to rise sharply
for the rest of the year. It is not clear, however, that these higher
costs will be reflected in prices quite so readily as in the recent
past; profit margins are quite substantial and might absorb some of
the cost increases if demand moderates.
There is a good deal of uncertainty as to where the German
economy is going. Some observers--especially the Bundesbank--stress the
level of new orders and order backlogs, the labor shortage, and the
high rate of capacity utilization in industry, and conclude that demand
pressures are essentially undiminished and additional deflationary
fiscal measures are required. Others--especially the Economics Ministry--
feel that the expansion is moderating and will continue to do so as the
revaluation and the deflationary measures already taken begin to have
an impact. They can cite as evidence the sluggishness of new orders
in some sectors and the expectations of many German businessmen (as
indicated in a recent survey) that demand and price pressures will be
less severe in coming months.
The United Kingdom has been experiencing probably the purest
cost-push inflation of any of the industrial countries. Prices have
been accelerating in recent months. Retail prices rose at annual rates
of 5.2 per cent in the fourth quarter of 1969, 7.6 per cent in the first

IV -14
quarter of this year, and 8.8 per cent in the three months ending in
April. Wholesale prices of manufactured products for home sales rose
5.2 per cent, 8.0 per cent, and 8.4 per cent, respectively, in the
same periods. Very little of this acceleration can be attributed to
excessive demand pressures. Unemployment remained high throughout
1969 and the first five months of this year (although there are
indications that a given rate of unemployment in Britain implies a
tighter labor market than used to be the case). Excess capacity has
been evident in most sectors, and profit margins seem to have been
depressed.
The shift of resources involved in the improved balance
of trade was the chief expansionary force operating in 1969, Private
investment recovered somewhat in the second half, but none of the other
components of domestic demand showed any significant strength.
Labor costs, on the other hand, have been accelerating.
Hourly wage rates rose at annual rates of 4.4 per cent in the third
quarter, 7.6 per cent in the fourth quarter, and 14.4 per cent in the
first quarter of 1970. Similarly, average wage and salary earnings
for all industries rose at an annual rate of 12 per cent from
September-November to December-February.
The explanation for these large increases in wages is not
entirely clear, but it certainly involves three factors: (1) expectations
of further price rises, based on inflation in other countries and,

IV -15
especially, on a 5 per cent annual rise in British retail prices
since 1967, which was, in turn, caused largely by sharply higher
post-devaluation import costs and sharp increases in indirect taxation;
(2) labor's desire to make up for the lack of any significant growth in
real income since 1967; and (3) the abandonment by the Labour Government
of any attempt to limit wage increases.
Real output is expected to increase this year by about
3-1/2 per cent--slightly more than the expected growth in productive
potential. It is difficult to foresee any improvement in price and
wage performance during the next several months, unless the authorities
change their policies after the June 18 election, and, in particular,
unless an effective incomes policy is implemented.
Inflationary pressures in the French economy continue to be
strong and are likely to persist through the end of the year and probably
during most of 1971.
The devaluation of the franc and the subsequent German parity
change have been followed by a marked increase in economic activity in
France. Industrial production is expanding at about a 6 per cent annual
rate, and is expected to continue to do so through the end of this
year. Moderately strong fiscal restraint and a very restrictive credit
policy, introduced last September, did not affect activity in the export
and investment sectors, but they did succeed in the major objective of
halting the previously strong expansion in the consumer goods sector.

IV -16
Hourly wage rates increased sharply last year--by about
10 per cent from year-end to year-end--and have continued to increase
even more markedly this year. In the first quarter, hourly wage rates
increased by 2.9 per cent--the largest quarterly increase for several
years, with the exception of the second quarter of 1968 when,
following the student and labor disturbances, the Grenelle agreements
increased hourly rates by 10.3 per cent. Consequently, the official
estimate for hourly wage increases during 1970 has been raised from
6.5 to 8.5 per cent, but even this estimate may not be realistic.
The situation in France is unlikely to change in the fore-
seeable future. Real GNP is now expected to expand by 6.1 per cent
from 1969 to 1970, up from the 4.0 per cent previously expected. The
flattening of consumer demand, now several months old, is unlikely to
persist, as the large wage increases during the first quarter of this
year will probably be reflected in consumer demand. With post-devaluation
demand in the export and investment sectors showing few signs of
slackening, price tensions may remain strong as the year goes on.
Finance Minister Giscard d'Estaing's target of a 4 per cent rise in
consumer prices in 1970 will almost certainly be exceeded--consumer
prices rose 2.2 per cent in the first four months alone.
The first quarter of 1970 saw a further acceleration of
increases in both wholesale and consumer prices in Italy. From
December to March, wholesale prices rose at a 10 per cent annual rate,

IV -17
and consumer prices at a 6-1/2 per cent rate, up significantly from
increases of 7.3 per cent and 4.2 per cent, respectively, from the
end of 1968 to the end of 1969.
Prices began to accelerate in 1969 as a result of higher
unit labor costs in many branches of industry, but two other factors
also bore responsibility. Strong demand pressures were present in some
cases; in particular, a construction boom was the main reason for
soaring steel prices. In addition, some industries--especially those
using non-ferrous metals--experienced sharp increases in the prices
of imported materials.
In 1970, unit labor costs will be much higher, and in all
sectors of the economy higher prices will be mainly ascribable to
cost-push influences. New labor contracts, following lengthy strikes,
called for very large wage increases effective in the early part of
this year. Minimum contractual wage rates in industry as a whole rose
13.2 per cent from December to February. The Bank of Italy cites a
recent estimate that in 1970 hourly earnings of wage earners will
exceed last year's by 16-17 per cent for the economy as a whole and by
more in industry. The Bank says that the rise in wages will outstrip
productivity gains by a 2-to-l ratio in the industries where productivity
gains are most rapid, and by a higher ratio in other industries.
Prices are expected to continue to rise rapidly. In some
sectors new wage contracts are still to be negotiated, and in October
national wage levels will be boosted by a further elimination of regional

IV -18
wage differentials. In all sectors except residential construction,
demand is likely to be sufficiently strong in 1970 for producers to
pass on a substantial part of the higher labor costs into prices.
Inflation in Belgium intensified during the fourthquarter
of 1969 and the first quarter of this year. From September to March,
wholesale prices of manufactured goods rose at an annual rate of 8.4 per
cent and consumer prices at an annual rate of 5.1 per cent--substantially
in excess of the increases in the 12 months prior to September.
Until now, Belgium's inflation has seemed to be essentially
of a demand-pull nature, stemming from buoyant spending in most sectors
of activity, particularly exports and plant and equipment expenditures.
Increasing demand for labor and declining unemployment produced a
9 per cent rise in hourly earnings in mining, manufacturing, and trans-
portation over the course of 1969, compared with 6 per cent the year
before.
Some slowing in aggregate demand appears to have set in this
year, reflecting less vigorous demand for exports, housing, and durable
consumer goods. Later in the year, the introduction of the value-added
tax scheduled for the beginning of 1971 should make inventory policy
very cautious. However, the rise in wage rates may accelerate further
because of tight labor market conditions. As productivity gains are
expected to be smaller in 1970, unit labor costs will put upward
pressure on prices and a squeeze on profits.

IV -19
Upward price pressures remain strong in the Netherlands.
A high level of demand has resulted in a generally full employment of
Dutch resources--especially labor. Exports have been a particularly
important element of growing aggregate demand; in the first four
months of this year, exports were 22 per cent greater in value than a
year earlier. The Dutch Central Planning Bureau now forecasts a
continuation of strong demand pressures for the remainder of 1970
and into 1971.
Moreover, Dutch authorities are deeply concerned with the
possibility of a renewed wage-price explosion, especially in view of
the inclusion in recent wage contracts of escalator clauses based on
changes in the consumer price index. In the trend-setting wage settle-
ment negotiated in the heavy metals sector, for example, wages were
increased 4.75 per cent effective January 1--which is reasonable given
an expected overall increase this year of 4 per cent in industrial labor
productivity. But the contract's escalator clause provides for semi-
annual wage adjustments linked to the cost-of-living index. Since
that index had already risen 2.7 per cent from mid-December through
mid-April, the metal workers will receive an additional 2.5 per cent
wage increase on July 1. The strength of demand makes it likely that
consumer prices will continue to rise, and that wages will be adjusted
up accordingly.

IV -20
Also contributing to the inflation is the mark revaluation,
which has caused the prices of goods imported from Germany to rise.
In 1969, imports from Germany accounted for 27 per cent of total
Dutch imports and equaled in value about 11 per cent of Dutch GNP.
The rate of inflation in Japan is the highest in over a
decade. In April, consumer prices were 8.0 per cent higher than a
year earlier, while wholesale prices were up 5.1 per cent. In recent
years, the average annual increase in the index of consumer prices
has been slightly over 5 per cent per year, while wholesale prices
have risen only 1 or 2 per cent per year.
Most of this acceleration is attributable to strong domestic
consumer and investment demand, but exports were 23 per cent higher in
the first quarter of 1970 than a year earlier. Unemployment has
declined slightly, and there has been an increased shortage of workers,
especially high school graduates.
Another factor has been cost-push from import prices, which
were 5.2 per cent higher in March than a year earlier, compared with a
decline of 0.6 per cent in the previous twelve months. Although imports
equal less than 10 per cent of Japanese GNP, some particularly sharp
increases in import prices (e.g,, non-ferrous metals) may have been important
Rising unit labor costs have also been a factor, but only to a
limited extent. Workers in major industries were granted a 17.5 per cent
wage hike this spring, in contrast to a 15.6 per cent increase in the
spring of 1969; but productivity increased 14.8 per cent in 1969.

IV -21
Although the Government is attempting to reduce inflationary
pressures--primarily through monetary policy and import liberalization--
the outlook is for continued pressure. If the Bank of Japan's rather
stringent program of restricting bank credit expansion has its intended
impact, some abatement is possible before the end of the year.
In Canada, there are some indications of easing of inflationary
pressures. GNP in real terms increased at a 6.8 per cent annual rate in
the first quarter, as exports showed a very sharp rise, mainly to Europe
and Japan. Industrial production rose at a 16 per cent annual rate
from October to February as a result of catching up after widespread
strikes in the second and third quarters last year; in March, however,
it declined by 1.9 per cent. Industrial production is now expected to
decline at least through the second quarter.
Lessening demand pressures also show up in retail sales and
unfilled orders in manufacturing, both of which declined for three
consecutive months through March. The unemployment rate has increased
sharply in recent months and in April was 5.6 per cent compared to
4.5 per cent in January.
Wholesale prices of manufactured goods have increased very
little since the spring of 1969, rising only 1.3 per cent in the twelve
months to April 1970. Raw materials prices, however, rose 5.6 per cent.
Consumer prices have yet to show any real moderation; the average
year-to-year increase in the CPI was 4.6 per cent in the first four
months of this year.

IV -22
While demand pressures on balance seem to be abating, cost
pressures are intensifying, Wage settlements in the first quarter were
running at over 9 per cent, somewhat higher than in the fourth quarter.
As industrial output declines, productivity will probably worsen and
unit labor costs increase at an accelerating rate. On the other hand,
the higher exchange rate which has existed since the Canadian Government
allowed the rate to float on June 1 will tend to reduce cost pressures
in the economy by lowering the Canadian dollar cost of imports. The
revaluation should also help to dampen demand pressures as and when
it leads to a reduction in Canada's unusually large trade surplus.

APPENDIX B: SURVEY OF BANK LENDING PRACTICES, MAY 1970*
The results of the May 15 Bank Lending Practices Survey
indicate that demand for commercial and industrial loans had increased
somewhat during the preceding three months. Nearly a fourth of the
respondents reported stronger loan demand while only about 10 per cent
had made such a response in the previous survey. Moreover, with respect
to their expectations of future loan demand, in the May survey, the
number of respondents expecting stronger demand was about double the
number expecting weaker demand, whereas in the February survey, the
reverse had been the case.
Terms and conditions of lending to nonfinancial business
Notwithstanding the reduction in the prime rate from 8-1/2 to
8 per cent on March 25, over three-fifths of the respondents reported
that their policies with respect to interest rates had remained unchanged
over the 3 months ending in mid-May and one-eighth of them had firmed
further their interest rate policies. Only one-fourth of the respon-
dents had eased those policies. Usually following a prime rate change,
a preponderance of companies report that their policies had changed in
the direction of the rate change.
About one-fifth of the sample had firmed requirements regarding
compensating balances and standards of credit worthiness and had placed
increased emphasis on the value of the borrower as a depositor in con-
sidering applications for credit. In addition, almost one-fourth had
become more restrictive in extending credit to new or nonlocal customers.
Nearly all the remaining respondents continued to maintain the restrictive
policies already reported in prior surveys.
Lending to "noncaptive" finance companies
One-fifth of the banks had eased policies on interest rates
charged finance companies. However, about one-fifth had become more
restrictive in establishing or enlarging credit lines. The overall
trend toward more restrictive non-rate terms and conditions on lending
to finance companies also was evidenced by the tighter enforcement of

compensating balance requirements, as well as by the increase in supporting
balances required by a few banks.
Willingness to make other types of loans
With respect to bank willingness to make selected types of
loans, the responses were mixed. There was a small net balance of banks
indicating greater willingness to grant consumer instalment and single-
family mortgage loans, while with respect to all other categories,
particularly term loans to business, broker loans, and nonresidential
mortgages, a small net balance of respondents indicated less willingness.
Size of bank variation
The responses of both large banks (with deposits of $1 billion
or more) and smaller banks (with deposits less than $1 billion) regard-
ing the strength of current and future loan demand were not significantly
different. However, firming of lending policies during the recent period
was more prevalent among the smaller than among the large banks, especially
on standards of credit worthiness, in reviewing credit lines for new and
nonlocal customers, and making term loans. On the other hand, increased
willingness to make mortgage loans was more prevalent among the large
banks.
Most banks cited declining liquidity positions and strong loan
demand as the major causes of their restrictive credit policies. Those
banks that had eased their lending practices had generally done so for
special purposes only--especially for loans to support the residential
housing market, promote higher education, or encourage pollution control.
