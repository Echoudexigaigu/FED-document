SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK
Nonfinancial
Real GNP is estimated to have edged up in the second quarter,
after two quarters of decline, and the rise in the GNP deflator appar-
1/
ently slowed appreciably." The better performance of real GNP reflected
mainly an ending of the cutback in inventory investment and some step-up
in consumer expenditures. A somewhat faster growth in real GNP seems
likely this quarter, with final sales expected to continue strong and
the rate of increase in the deflator to moderate further.
The recent performance of key monthly measures has been mixed.
Industrial production declined in June but less than in May. Since the
peak in July 1969, the index has fallen about 3-1/2 per cent. Further
curtailment in output of both business equipment and defense in June
was a major contractive influence, as in the preceding months. Output
of consumer goods increased in June, however, with production of auto-
mobiles, consumer staples and television higher. Retail sales apparent-
ly rose slightly in June, and for the quarter as a whole were well above
the first quarter. Most important has been recovery in auto sales--in
June sales of domestic cars had risen to an 8.6 million annual rate, a
high for the year. The average rate of increase in book value of business

of second quarter GNP, along with the revisions for the past three years
that are made available each July.

I- 2
inventories for April and May was less than in the first quarter. On
a GNP basis, however, after the valuation adjustment, inventory invest-
ment is estimated to show little change in the second quarter.
Although the unemployment rate declined to 4.7 per cent in
June, demands for labor continued weak. Hiring of summer workers was
below usual in almost all industries, and seasonally adjusted nonfarm
employment registered another sizable decline. Apparently reflecting
the reduction in job opportunities, fewer youths entered the labor force
than last June and the total labor force declined considerably. Initial
claims for unemployment insurance have declined further through early
July while continued claims have changed little.
The Chicago teamster's strike was settled early in July,
with wage increases amounting to approximately 13 per cent per year
over a three year period. As had been agreed earlier, the national
contract was modified in line with the Chicago settlement.
Farm and food prices declined in June for the third successive
month, after allowance for seasonal influences. Wholesale industrial
commodity prices have continued to rise, but there has been increasing
evidence of a lessening of upward pressures in this area also. The
number of commodity subgroups reporting price increases was smaller
than in any month since last August, while price declines were more
widespread than earlier. Prices of nonferrous metals, which has risen
very sharply over the past two years, are now generally under downward
pressure. Moreover, supply and demand imbalances have apparently
resulted in a shading of actual prices below list for a number of
commodities.

I-3
Outlook. A further--and larger--rise in real GNP is expected
in the present quarter. Recent data point to continued strength in
consumer spending, a bottoming out in residential construction outlays
and a faster rise in State and local expenditures. The projected GNP
path for subsequent quarters also remains essentially the same as
presented in the June 23 Chart Show. Some gradual recovery in inventory
accumulation, sustained growth in consumer spending, and rising residen-
tial construction activity should serve to bolster aggregate demand.
But probable declines in business fixed investment and defense outlays
are expected to limit the upswing. On balance, growth is projected to
be well below potential resource availability; unemployment is likely
to edge up and price increases to moderate somewhat.
Financial
Conditions in financial markets during the past several weeks
have been dominated by the rather dramatic down-turn in bond yields and
heavy net attrition of commercial paper. Major factors in the yield
turn around--which has run to as much as 5/8 of a percentage point in
some series--have been a shift of investor sentiment about prospects
inflation and real growth, and an abatement of concerns about immediate
liquidity problems. It is now widely assumed in the market that private
demands for credit are likely to moderate somewhat over the months ahead
and that monetary policy will be on the expansive side. As these changed
expectations have developed, institutional investors have increased their
bond buying to lock up high yields. Meanwhile, stock prices declined
on balance early in the period but most recently have recovered much
of this loss.

I -4
The net run-off of commercial paper, although focused selec-
tively on a relative small number of issuers, was much larger than
anticipated. In the main, industrial and finance company issuers forced
out of the paper market have refinanced at commercial banks, with a
consequent sharp rise in bank loans around mid-year. The lion's share
of the funds shifted out of commercial paper appears to have flowed back
to banks in response to the higher rates being paid on 30-89 day CD's,
but demands for other market securities have also risen. Among other
things, this has helped keep yields on Treasury bills from advancing
seasonally, despite the large volume of Treasury tax bill financing in
the period.
Securities market outlook. Over the weeks ahead, demands on
securities markets will be sizable. The Treasury, in particular, must
refinance $5.6 billion of publicly-held August maturities. And there
is a chance that this operation will be enlarged by several billion dollars
to cover the bulk of the Treasury's remaining third quarter needs for
new money. In the corporate bond market, the forward calendar suggests
that new issue volume will remain very heavy, although dropping from
the second quarter when the very large AT&T issue was marketed. In the
municipal bond market, with yields recently off substantially, there is
a chance that previously unsatisfied borrowers will add to volume.
These large credit needs will tend to limit further interest
rate declines over the near-term, but if incoming evidence on the
developing state of the economy should appear to confirm the changed
expectations, interest rates may well fall further. Over the longer

I -5
run, as the rate of inflation subsides, we would expect bond yields to
work lower in any events
Banking outlook. Demands for bank credit will depend heavily
on developments in the commercial paper market. While this market has
performed better in recent days, there appears to be a continuing in
some degree of investor withdrawals from paper issued by lesser name
firms and firms linked to parent companies whose condition has come
under question. Consequently, the possibility of some further shrinkage
in commercial paper over the weeks ahead cannot be ruled out. In most
instances, banks will probably be willing to meet demands arising from
such shrinkage, given the availability of funds from 30-89 day CD's.
Because of the special demands for bank credit being created
by the commercial paper run-off, it is difficult to gauge the more
general strength of business loan demands. In June, business borrowing
grew less rapidly than in May, although some of this may have reflected
larger loan repayments from the proceeds of capital market financing.
Given the modest nature of the projected third quarter upturn in economic
activity and the large volume of anticipated capital market financings,
business loan growth unrelated to commercial paper seems likely to remain
relatively moderate.
On the liability side, growth of large bank CD's can be
expected to remain rapid, although the rate of increase should decline
as the quarter progresses. To some extent such inflows will probably
be used to substitute for high cost Euro-dollars and foreign official
time deposits and perhaps also for commercial paper issued by bank

I- 6
affiliates -- even though current cost comparisons in the latter case
are not unfavorable. Inflows of consumer-type time and savings deposits
have held up well following mid-year interest crediting and are likely
to remain better as the quarter progresses.
Non-bank thrift institutions. The fact that non-bank thrift
institutions have not come under serious pressure from withdrawals
following mid-year interest crediting represents an important further
step in rebuilding of liquidity at these institutions. Although rates
on thrift accounts are still substantially below yields on market
securities, several factors have apparently contributed to the better
performance of thrift accounts -- increased over-all consumer savings,
the desire for insured readily cashable assets, and the restrictions
on minimum denominations of Treasury and Federal agency securities.
With the mid-year disintermediation threat fading, savings and loan
associations in particular are likely to increase loan commitments,
and by mid-summer commitments made earlier should begin to show up in
larger mortgage acquisitions.
Balance of Payments
The very large "over-all adjusted deficits" in April and May
and in most of June were partly offset by a surplus of more than half
a billion dollars in the last few days of June. Nevertheless, the
second-quarter accounts will show a deficit on this basis, seasonally
adjusted, of about $2-1/4 billion according to very preliminary data,
substantially exceeding the first-quarter deficit of $1.4 billion.
(These are quarterly amounts, not annual rates; SDR allocation is

1- 7
excluded as well as certain special transactions. Virtually the same
picture is given by the liquidity deficit adjusted for changes in
"nonliquid" foreign official assets and other special transactions.)
Without seasonal adjustment, the deficit in the first half as a whole
was about $3-1/2 billion. Settlement for the half year required net
official reserve transactions of close to $5 billion, since liabilities
to commercial banks abroad (as reported by banks in the United States,
including the liabilities of foreign bank branches and agencies in this
country to banks abroad) declined by about $1-1/2 billion.
The causes of the worsening in the over-all balance in the
second quarter -- when the trade surplus was improving slightly -- remain
conjectural. Evidently private capital movements were heavily adverse
in the second quarter. We assume that these outflows included movements
of private funds from the United States into Euro-dollars, German marks,
and Canadian dollars. The return flow in late June, concentrated as it
was near the end of the quarter, is thought likely to have included
substantial window-dressing movements by U.S. corporations subject to
OFDI direct investment controls.
The large size and variability of these flows make any effort
at precise projection of the balance of payments in coming months an
unprofitable exercise. Some further gradual improvement in net exports
of goods and services is expected. But presumably deficits will continue
to be large until significant changes occur in the attractiveness of
U.S. equities to foreigners, in speculative attitudes toward strong
currencies such as the German mark, and in relative interest rates.

I -8
Euro-dollar interest rates, though down now to the 9 per cent level
again for 3-month money and below 8 per cent for call money, continue
to show unusually wide spreads over rates on U.S. Treasury bills and
Federal funds. High though Euro-dollar rates are in relation to U.S.
rates (and also to U.K. rates), money market rates in Germany are even
higher.
The fiscal policy measures taken in Germany last week were
followed today by small reductions (effective July 16) in the Bundesbank's
Lombard rate and discount rate. It is to be hoped that some additional
easing of German monetary policy lies ahead. Data on German new orders
through May just released show some further easing of demand at the
factory level. German industry's order backlogs, however, remain very
large, and wage increases apparently are continuing to exert inflationary
pressure in the German economy.

THE ECONOMIC PICTURE IN DETAIL
Domestic Nonfinancial Scene
Gross national product. We now estimate that the second
quarter increase in GNP will be $11.5 billion (in current dollars),
as compared with a $7.4 billion actual increase in the first quarter.
This is a slightly larger second quarter gain than we had projected
in the last Greenbook, with most of the difference accounted for by a
somewhat larger rise in consumer outlays than had been anticipated
earlier.
Price increases apparently have moderated about as we had
expected and the rise in the GNP implicit price deflator is still
estimated at 4.5 per cent, down appreciably from the 5.2 per cent
annual rate (excluding the retroactive Federal pay raise) in the
first quarter. As a result, real GNP apparently turned the corner,
rising slightly in the second quarter after declining at an annual
rate of 3 per cent in the first quarter.

The increase of $1-1/2 billion in our estimate of consumer
expenditures resulted in part from progressive improvement in unit sales
of domestic autos over the past several months as well as strong sales
of imported cars. Sales for June were at an 8.6 million annual rate,
and for the quarter as a whole the rate averaged just under 8 million
units rather than the 7.6 million projected earlier. Also, sales of
most types of nondurable goods held up well over the past 2 months. Ex-
penditures in most other sectors of the economy were about in line with
our previous projections.

II -3
Given the assumption of continued moderate monetary expansion--
with the money supply growing at around a 4 per cent annual rate--our
projections for the remainder of 1970 and the first half of 1971 remain
essentially unchanged from those presented in the June 23 Chart Show.
While uncertainties remain about the fate and timing of some Administration
tax and expenditures proposals, it appears likely that an increase in
estimated outlays and a reduction in the estimate for receipts will
result in a budget deficit of $8.4 billion (NIA basis) rather than $5.9
billion for fiscal 1971. These changes are expected to have little or
no impact on purchases of goods and services for fiscal 1971 as a whole.
Recent information has suggested some minor adjustments in a
few sectors which tend to reduce slightly the projected GNP increase
for the remainder of the year. Defense purchases may not decline as
rapidly as expected in the second half of 1970, although this will likely
be made up by a somewhat faster pace of decline early next year. On the
other hand, delays are now anticipated in the delivery of some 747 jets
to foreign customers and this is expected to hold down net exports in
the second half of this year. But with these deliveries bunched in early
1971, net exports should then rise sharply, particularly since an increase
now also seems likely in agricultural exports.
On balance, then, a moderate gain in consumer spending, a
bottoming out in construction activity and the resumption of more normal
growth of State and local outlays are expected to bring an improved rate
of overall real growth in the third quarter, particularly if the downward

II -4
adjustment in inventories is largely behind us, as now appears to be the
case. A further small pick-up in the rate of real growth is expected
later this year as construction activity gains expansive momentum. But
with investment likely to join defense as a declining sector, the real
rate of growth throughout the projected period is expected to remain
well below our expanding potential to produce. Some further increase
in unemployment and a moderate but steady reduction in inflationary
pressures continue in prospect.

Industrial production. Industrial production was down 0.3 per
cent in June, following an 0.6 per cent decline in May, and at 168.6 was
about 3-1/2 per cent below last summer's high. Output of consumer goods
rose further, but production of business and defense equipment and some
materials continued to decline. Reductions in output of business equip-
ment were widespread, as in the two previous months. However, truck
assemblies which had declined 20 per cent from the end of 1969 to April,
advanced rapidly in May and June in response to a pick-up in sales and
the possibility of an auto industry strike in September. Production of
business equipment was down 4.5 per cent fromthis March and 6.5 per
cent from the September-October peak for that series, prior to the G.E.
strike. Since last fall, output of defense products has declined
15 per cent and even more from last summer.
Auto assemblies rose 4.5 per cent in June and were at an annual
rate of 8.4 million units, the highest since the start of the year. In-
dustry production schedules for the third quarter indicate an annual
rate of about 8.5 million units. Output of television sets rose sharply
in June from the very low May level and production of consumer staples
increased. But output of furniture declined and production of appli-
ances was cut back from the record April-May high.
Among materials, output of iron and steel was about unchanged
last month, but production of construction materials, paper products
and industrial chemicals continued to decline. Output of coal was cur-
tailed by strikes and production of rubber products recovered following
settlement of labor disputes.

Retail sales. Advance data indicate that retail sales edged up
in June, following an 0.7 per cent decline in May. However, revised data
show a very strong rise of 2-1/2 per cent in April, which served to raise
the level of sales for the quarter as a whole. The resulting quarter to
quarter increase in sales--the largest in two years--apparently reflects
the substantial additions to income in April and May attributable to retro-
active increases in Social Security benefits and in Federal pay. Sales
relative to disposable income were a bit lower than in the first quarter.
It should also be noted that retail prices of goods increased somewhat
more rapidly in April and May than earlier this year, and in real terms
retail volume was still below the peak in the third quarter of 1968.July 1969

Durable goods sales rose 3.0 per cent from the first to the

building material, hardware and farm equipment group increased signifi-
cantly for the first time sinceearly 1969. Gains in nondurable goods
sales were smaller than in the first quarter, but the increase of 1,7 per
cent was still well above the average quarterly increase for 1969. Sales
at department stores advanced 3.3 per cent.

Unit auto sales and stocks. Unit sales of new domestic autos
in the first ten days in July were at an annual rate of 7.9 million units,
down 8 per cent from the 8.6 rate of June and 1 per cent below a year ago.

Dealer's stocks of new domestic autos declined slightly further
during June and at the end of the month represented 51 days supply,
compared with 69 days on January 31 and 50 days on June 30, 1969.
Consumer credit. Consumer instalment credit outstanding rose
at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $5.0 billion in May, the largest
advance since February. The increase was still well below the quarterly
gains of 1969, however, which averaged $8.1 billion.
Both extensions and repayments of instalment debt showed un-
usually large increases in May; the most sizable gains were in non-
automotive consumer goods--where both extensions and repayments reached
new records--and in personal loans. Although extensions of auto credit
moved up to their highest point since last November, repayments exceeded
extensions for the fourth time in the past 6 months.

Manufacturers' new orders. In May, manufacturers' new orders
rose 2.6 per cent, with a 3.3 per cent increase for durables and a 1.9
per cent rise for nondurables. All but one of the major market groups
were above lows reached in March or April.
The April-May average was slightly above the first quarter for
durables and below it for nondurables. Most of the increase in durables
occurred in the automotive group, and in an associated rise in steel
ordering. There was some increase in the soft goods portion of the home
goods and apparel group, and there was a rise in construction materials
that was attributable to a large atomic reactor order in May. Orders
for defense products and for other capital goods, taking April and May
together, declined from the first quarter average.

The recent leveling-off in the dollar value of durables orders--
which becomes a slight decline in real orders, after account is taken of
price increases--contrasts with the fairly strong recovery in orders after
a decline of roughly the same magnitude during the early 1967 economic
slowdown. In 1967, manufacturing output resumed its rise in the third
quarter.

Shipments of both durable and nondurable goods increased in May,
The backlog of durable goods orders declined another 1 per cent, and the
ratio of the backlog to the month's shipments declined to 2.97, the lowest
point since early 1965.
Inventories. Book value of business inventories declined at a
$3.4 billion annual rate in May, according to preliminary data, after
having risen at an $11 billion rate in April. The May inventory declines
may reflect the impact of strikes on production and deliveries, but they
also brought inventories more in line with sales.

II -13
The revised April rate of inventory increase is almost double
that reported a month ago; upward adjustments were made in both manufactur-
ing and wholesale figures. The April-May average rate is below the first-
quarter rate, but the rise in wholesale prices was also slowing in the
second quarter, so that the valuation adjustment is also likely to be
smaller.

In manufacturing, the incidence of inventory declines (or slower
growth) in May was widespread. With the end of the steel hauling strike,
there was a much smaller increase in primary metals inventories, while
durables goods manufacturers continued to cut materials stocks. In
addition, there were sharp declines in stocks at apparel, household goods,
and automotive manufacturers. At retail, except for auto dealers and a
slight increase at food stores, all groups reported declines.I

II -14
Manufacturers' and wholesalers' sales recovered in May from
April's strike-affected lows and thus inventory-sales ratios declined.
May retail sales were off a little, and the retail ratio was unchanged.
Decreases in ratios at nonautomotive outlets were offset by an increase
at auto dealers, where May's stocking-up reflected anticipation of in-
creased sales and perhaps the uncertainties of the forthcoming contract
negotiations as well. The order backlog at durables manufacturers
declined more than their inventories, and the already high inventory-
backlog ratio rose further.

Cyclical indicators. In May, the preliminary leading and
coincident composite indexes fell, while the preliminary lagging com-
posite rose slightly. The leading composite has declined 3.2 per cent
over the six months of slowdown since November; this is slightly more
than in the first six months of the 1960-61 recession, and contrasts
with a 2-1/2 per cent increase over six months of slowdown in the first
half of 1967.

Although orders for machinery and equipment rose in May, there
was a substantial decline in contracts and orders for plant and equipment
because of reductions in construction contracts. Other series declining
were the manufacturing workweek, industrial materials prices, common
stock prices, and the ratio of price to unit labor cost. Series increas-
ing were durable goods orders, initial claims for unemployment insurance
(inverted), and housing permits.
In June, the workweek was unchanged, the preliminary common
stock price index was about unchanged, the preliminary materials price
index declined, and initial unemployment claims increased (Inverted).

II -16
Construction and real estate. Seasonally adjusted new
construction put in place changed little in June. However, there was
a 2 per cent downward revision in April and May and the annual rate
for June, at $85.8 billion was 6 per cent below a year earlier--ll per
cent in real terms--and the lowest since September of 1968.
With housing starts down further in May (the latest month for
which data are available), private residential construction outlays
continued to drop in June and were a fifth under the peak in April of
1969. Private nonresidential construction and public construction
expenditures apparently remained at or slightly above their reduced
May rates.

In the overall market for shelter, a surprising development
has been the relatively low rate of mobile home shipments. Through May,
such shipments averaged no more than 380,000 units on a seasonally

II -17
adjusted annual rate basis, compared with a record 413,000 for 1969 as
a whole and earlier trade expectations of a substantially higher total
this year. The trucking strike reportedly impeded shipments from
mobile home manufacturers earlier this year. In addition, as in the case
of the conventional home market, it may be that high monthly carrying
costs and uncertainty about future employment prospects have served to
weaken retail demand.
Within the regular home market, seasonally adjusted sales by
speculative builders in May were holding above the exceptionally low
rate reached last March with some resultant improvement in builders'
stock/sales ratios from earlier advanced positions. But average prices
of those homes sold by builders remained appreciably below prices
of homes still available for sale, as well as below sales prices pre-
vailing at this time last year, reflecting continued price resistance
by potential home-buyers. In the market for existing homes, on the
other hand, average prices of units sold continued about 7 per cent above
a year earlier.
Labor market. Although the unemployment rate declined in June,
there was no indication of strengthening labor demand. Hiring was below
normal levels in most industries, and seasonally adjusted nonfarm payroll
employment again showed a sizable decline. On the other hand, initial
claims for unemployment benefits have edged down in recent weeks--in-
dicating fewer layoffs and a slower increase of unemployment from this

II -18
cause--and total insured unemployment has about leveled off after rising
steeply in April and May.
The entire decline in the upemployment rate to 4.7 per cent
in June, from 5.0 per cent in May, occurred among adult women, whose
rate had jumped sharply in May. The rate for adult men was unchanged
at 3.5 per cent--its highest level since early 1965, and up sharply
from a low of 1.9 per cent in the first quarter of 1969.

Payroll employment. Nonfarm payroll employment declined by
270,000 in June compared with a drop of 185,000 in May (both months
strike adjusted). Employment declines were widespread, with all major
industry groups down except transportation, and State and local govern-
ments. Manufacturing employment declined 130,000 in June (following a
165,000 cut in May, both strike adjusted), with reductions of 20,000 or
more in transportation equipment and machinery. Construction employment
was below a year earlier in May and June for the first time in several
years.

II -19
In the second quarter of 1970, total nonfarm employment
registered its first quarterly decline since the 1960-61 recession.
With employment growth dampened in service industries and halted in
trade, advances in the nonindustrial sector were no longer sufficient
to offset large and widespread declines in the goods-producing industries.
Recent employment reductions probably reflect in part a lagged response
to the earlier easing of demands and have been associated with a
resumption of productivity growth both in manufacturing and in the
private nonfarm economy.

* Adjusted for changes resulting from the direct effects of large
strikes.
The average workweek in manufacturing was unchanged at 39.8
hours in June, but was nearly one hour shorter than a year earlier,
reflecting a cut of 0.7 hour in overtime hours at premium pay. In
the durable goods sector, small declines in average hours in June in
most industries were offset by a rise of more than one hour in
transportation equipment.

II -20
Labor force. The labor force declined between May and June,
reflecting a half a million smaller-than-expected rise in the teenage
labor force. In addition to the relative unavailability of summer
jobs, this change may have resulted from such noneconomic factors as
an early survey week. Somewhat more than the usual numbers of high school
students and graduates were probably unavailable for Wokk because schools
were still in session. Labor force participation for young workers is
erratic and there could be a rebound in July .
At the same time, easing demand for labor may have dampened
labor force participation somewhat for women, and in recent months
their net labor force increase from a year earlier has been in better
alignment with "normal" growth as projected on the basis of changes in
population of working age and long-term trends in labor force partici-
pation rates. The large labor force rise for adult men reflects, in
part, recent reductions in the Armed Forces.

Productivity. Manufacturing productivity rose sharply in the
first half of 1970 as reductions in employment and working hours
continued larger than cuts in production. Output per manhour is estimated
to have risen at an annual rate of 4.6 per cent from December to June,
after declining at a 2 per cent annual rate between June and December
of 1969.
Compensation per manhour in manufacturing rose at an estimated
6.0 per cent annual rate during the first half of 1970, with the advance
dampened somewhat by further reductions in overtime work at premium
pay and by employment declines in high-wage durable goods industries.
Although the rise in compensation slowed, the sharp recovery of pro-
ductivity growth was the prime factor in a marked slowing of the rise
of unit labor costs in manufacturing.

II -22
Adjustments in employment and hours in nonmanufacturing
industries in the second quarter probably resulted in a resumption of
productivity growth in the private nonfarm economy as a whole. The
record of unit labor costs in the nonmanufacturing industries has
been much worse than in manufacturing, reflecting poorer produc-
tivity performance and slightly larger wage gains. In 1969, for
example, the estimated unit labor cost rise for the private nonfarm
economy was about 6 per cent compared with 4 per cent in manufacturing.
The bulk of the difference resulted from the virtual absence of
productivity growth in nonmanufacturing industries as a whole.
Industrial relations. After nearly three months of strikes
and lockouts, major trucking firms and 50,000 members of local teamster
unions in Chicago agreed early in July to a new contract providing
$1.65 in wage increases over 36 months. This settlement triggered
renegotiation of the national trucking agreement which had been
ratified in mid-May by 450,000 teamsters and major trucking associations.
The national contract, which originally had called for wage increases
of $1.10 over 39 months, now provides $1.85 in wage increases, 20 cents
more than in Chicago to compensate for the longer term of the national
agreement. The master contract now provides an average annual wage
increase of 12-1/2 per cent, with a first-year increase of 14 per cent.
Fringe benefits are also higher in the new contract, and wage and
fringe benefit costs will rise an average of about 13 per cent a year--
about equal to the increases negotiated in construction settlements in

II -23
the first three months of this year and sharply
higher than the 8 per cent average for all major contracts settled
during that period.
Trucking firms are expected to ask the ICC for rate increases
of 7-1/2 to 12-1/2 per cent a year to offset higher labor costs, and
it is expected that increases will be granted. The new settlement
will increase costs and prices throughout a wide range of industries
supplying both producers and consumers. It is likely to have a
significant impact on the CPI, as transportation costs have considerable
influence on many retail prices, especially of food.
This large settlement has been widely publicized and is
likely to influence other wage negotiations in both manufacturing
and nonmanufacturing industries. It will add to pressure on union
leaders for a similar large settlement in the automobile industry,
where negotiations on a new contract begin this week.

I -24
Wholesale prices. In the last three months, a reversal in
the upward trend of seasonally adjusted farm and food products prices
at wholesale has slowed the rise in the wholesale price index.
Furthermore, the rise in wholesale prices of industrial commodities
shows some signs of moderating. The increase in June of 3.6 per cent
(seasonally adjusted annual rate) in industrial commodity prices,
although only slightly below the average for the first half of this
year, was appreciably below the last half of 1969. Much of the rise
in June was attributable to a sharp (7.8 per cent) advance in prices
of cigarettes.

Moreover, signs of weakness are numerous in sensitive crude
material prices. Nonferrous metal prices, for which increases had
outstripped those of other materials over the last two years, are now
falling. Increases in prices of copper and aluminum which were put into

II -25
effect this year by major producers recently have begun to give way.
In June, nonferrous metals as a group declined for the first time since
September 1968. Copper scrap prices (generally more volatile than
copper ingot) fell, as did the prices of imported copper wirebar, brass,
ingot, and tin.
Since the WPI pricing date (June 9), copper scrap has fallen
further and primary lead has been reduced. The reduction in prices of
copper in dealer markets here and in London has resulted in cuts in
prices of brass mill products even though prices of domestic producers
remain unchanged. Zinc prices (which have been supported recently by
producers in Europe) are likely to drop. Aluminum products have been
reported to be selling under list for some time. Most of the recent
declines are attributable to diminished pressure from both domestic and
world demand. Supplies also have improved as a result of greatly
diminished strike activity.
Nonferrous metals are not a sufficiently important fraction
of the cost of production of most finished goods to affect the over-all
measures significantly. However, the reversal of trend among these
volatile prices may be indicative of similar pressures developing in
other wholesale markets, such as for steel.
The number of price increases in industrial product classes
was fewer from May to June than in any month since last August. Out
of 228 product classes 87 rose, a significantly lower proportion than
in any of the first six months of 1970, and even further below the first
halves of 1968 and 1969. The incidence of price declines in June was

II -26
the highest since July 1968. Of 13 major industry groups, 5 declined,
and 2 were unchanged. Declines were mainly in materials prices,
including lumber and plywood (reversing a rise in the previous two
months), wastepaper, industrial chemicals, hides and skins, rubber,
and wool, silk and synthetic textiles.

Although a sharp increase in cigarette prices was a major factor
in the June rise in the industrial average, there were several increases of
more basic significance. Coal prices rose again, and were about one-third
above a year earlier. Exports of coal are continuing to rise and, in view
of low coal stockpiles at utilities, curbs are being suggested. Partly as a
result of consumers shifting from coal to oil, residual oil prices also are
climbing.

II -27
Prices of some important steel finished products and steel
scrap also rose from May to June. This may be the last large increase
for finished steel products this year, since most of the products
included in the industry-imposed limitation to raise prices only once
a year have now been raised.
The rise in finished goods slowed some in June from recent
months, both for consumer and producer goods. The bulge in prices of
producers' equipment in the second half of 1969 and in the opening months
of this year has slackened off recently, and prices of agricultural
equipment declined slightly in June.

II -28
Farm output prospects. Midyear surveys of farm production
prospects indicate that substantial increases in supplies are likely
by fall for the farm products under strong upward price pressure this
summer--hogs, feed grains, and soybeans. In fact if production
prospects are realized, farm prices of most of the major crops may be
down to support levels by harvest and hog prices will be under down-
ward pressure from substantially larger supplies. By September, hog
slaughter is expected to be well above the small output of last fall
and also to exceed the relatively large output of 1968. If producers
carry out plans reported in late June, further expansion in pork
supplies can be expected in 1971.
Expanded acreages of feed grains indicate that plentiful
supplies of livestock feeds will be available for the 1970/71 feeding
season. Larger output of cotton and oilseeds is in prospect but
food grains have been cut to hold production in balance with prospec-
tive demand. More fresh vegetables and citrus fruits are in prospect
but less deciduous fruits. Carryover stocks of most of the
processed fruits and vegetables are large.
Throughout the first half of 1970, livestock food supplies
were made up of record quantities of beef and broilers, more eggs than
the year before, about the same amount of milk and reduced quantities
of pork, veal and lamb. This mix of supplies is likely to persist
until fall when expanding pork production will be added to livestock
food supplies.

THE ECONOMIC PICTURE IN DETAIL
Domestic Financial Situation
Monetary aggregates. A slight decline in the money stock
was recorded in June, as private demand deposits edged downward while
public currency holdings increased at a much slower pace than in May.
The June decline followed a moderate advance in May and led to an
annual rate of expansion for the second quarter as a whole of 4.6 per
cent.
The money stock rose sharply again in late June and early
July. In part, this increase was associated with the surge in bank
lending to finance companies and nonfinancial businesses to refinance
maturing commercial paper. In addition, cash items in process of
collection increased much less than normally during the week ending
July 1--presumably reflecting a cutback in bank borrowing in the
Euro-dollar market as CD funds became available. Some buildup of
precautionary balances also might have occurred in conjunction with the
crunch in the commercial paper market.
Time and savings deposits at all commercial banks increased
at a somewhat slower rate in June than in May, as the downtrend in
outstanding large CD's, which began in May, was extended throughout
most of June. Inflows into consumer-type deposits in June, on the
other hand, appear to have continued at roughly the same rate as in
other recent months. Indications are that savings deposit withdrawals
following the interest-crediting period have been very modest.

III -2
Following suspension of ceiling rates on short-term CD's on
June 24, the flow of CD funds was altered radically. During the week
of July 1, weekly reporting banks alone sold nearly $1.2 billion in
new CD's and in the following week New York City and Chicago banks--
the only banks for which data are thus far available--reported further
gains totaling more than $400 million.
In addition to the growth in time deposits during June, a
substantial rise also was recorded in U.S. Treasury deposits. Together,
these inflows were more than sufficient to offset the drop in private
demand deposits, and the unadjusted credit proxy rose moderately in
June after declining in May. The credit proxy adjusted for nondeposit
sources rose at a slightly faster pace over the month as many banks
continued tapping nondeposit sources for funds until the suspension of
the short-term CD ceilings. Beginning with the influx of CD money in
the latter days of June, however, banks began cutting back on their
nondeposit fund sources. This retrenchment primarily took the form of
a sharp, greater than seasonal, reduction in Euro-dollar borrowings but
commercial paper indebtedness also was reduced to some extent.

Net acquisitions of Treasury securities slowed substantially
in June, as growth in U.S. Government securities was held down partly
by bank sales of notes acquired in the mid-May Treasury financing. But
the rate of growth in other investments was larger than in May, with
the bulk of the increase in short-term municipals, representing prin-
cipally New York City banks' purchases of notes sold by New York State.

III -5
Commercial and industrial loans, including loan sales, rose
at about a 5-1/2 per cent annual rate in June--roughly the same as for
the second quarter as a whole. The moderate rate of increase in busi-
ness loans on average parallels the behavior of real economic activity
and, in particular, the sluggishness of inventory investment.
Despite the rise in business loans, total loans declined in
June, due to a sharp drop in security loans. Government security
dealers cut back their inventory positions substantially after the May
financing, and other security dealers also reduced their inventories in
the late June bond market rally. Both real estate and consumer loans
were unchanged from a month earlier, continuing the weakness in these
categories evident since late last year. Finance company loans rose by
about the same amount on a seasonally adjusted basis as a month earlier.
The June bank credit data, however, do not adequately
reflect the substitution of bank loans for commercial paper that
occurred late in June and early July following the sharp runoff of
investor holdings in the commercial paper market and the suspension of
Regulation Q ceilings on short-term CD's. The increase in total loans
and investments at all weekly reporting banks in the week ending July 1
plus the increase at weekly reporters in New York and Chicago for the
week ending July 8 amounted to nearly $3.5 billion, or $2.6 billion
more than the average for the same groupings of banks in the corres-
ponding two-week period of the preceding three years. About three-fifths
of this increase appeared to reflect the transfer of borrowing away from
the commercial paper market, with the remainder mainly accounted for by

III -6
bank underwriting of tax bills paid for on July 8 through full crediting
to tax and loan accounts.

Finance company loans jumped nearly $1.1 billion during this
two-week period, as many investors were reluctant to roll over maturing
commercial paper of some companies who were then forced into using bank
lines. Although bank loans to finance companies usually exhibit a
brief bulge at mid-year, this year's rise was far greater than any pre-
vious one and was not offset as rapidly as usual although small repayments
were made at New York City and Chicago banks in the week ending July 8.
Some industrial concerns also were affected by the deterioration in the
commercial paper market and had to finance at banks, but the rise in
business loans at banks was a good deal smaller relative to past experi-
ence than that of loans extended to finance companies.

III -7
Other short-term credit markets. The Penn Central's request
for reorganization under the Federal Bankruptcy Act and rumors of diffi-
culty elsewhere in the commercial paper market--particularly among some
financial subsidiaries of companies that have incurred losses--led to a
sharp shrinkage in the amount of commercial paper outstanding around
mid-year. The adjustment affected both dealer-placed and directly-placed
paper. Whereas seasonally unadjusted data for May-June 1969 showed an
increase of 2.6 per cent in total commercial paper outstanding, compar-
able 1970 figures show a decline of 6.1 per cent or $2.4 billion. Only
about half of this decline can be attributed to the average seasonal
decrease.

For the week ending July 1, 1970, which included large mid-year
maturities, unadjusted data show a decline of $930 million in dealer-
placed paper and of $1,349 million in directly-placed paper. This repre-
sents a one-week decrease of $2,279 million or 5.8 per cent in commercial
paper outstanding. Preliminary data for the week ending July 8 show
little further changes in outstandings during that week.
Owing to resistance by investors, several dealers are willing
to handle only top-grade paper or to operate only on a broker basis,
thus forcing potential borrowers to turn to banks. A number of finance
companies--with the exception of GMAC and some other highly regarded
companies--also have had to turn to their banks. Thus the decline in
commercial paper outstandings has been accompanied by increases in bank
loans--sometimes secured by sales of accounts receivable--and by exten-
sion of additional lines of credit. In addition, the market situation
appears to have forced a shortening of maturities for newly-issued
finance company paper, but there is no clear indication that a compar-
able shift has occurred on the dealer side of the market.

Rates on commercial paper maturing in 30 days or less have
risen 1/8 of a per cent since June 19. Rates on other maturities of
commercial and finance paper have remained unchanged, suggesting that
market difficulties have affected mainly credit availability and the
quantity of outstandings rather than interest rates. Issuers have
shown a reluctance to raise their rates because of concern that such
action would shed doubt on the status of their paper. Nevertheless,
there are some indications of a new interest rate split within the
market with "desirable" paper, in contrast to "prime" paper, now being
quoted around 1/4 of a per cent higher in yield.
Although many customers appear to have moved out of the
market entirely, the over-all stability of commercial paper rates
reflects a generally good demand for top-grade paper as well as the
unwillingness of borrowers and dealers to push paper aggressively in
the present market environment. Nevertheless, there has been some
widening in the yield spreads of commercial paper over Treasury bills
and bankers' acceptances since June 19, as investors have shifted away
from commercial paper to alternative short-term holdings.
Nonbank depositary intermediaries. Available data suggest
that withdrawals during the June-July reinvestment period were quite
modest. Savings and loan associations in particular, including the
sensitive West coast S&L's, incurred very small deposit outflows during
the early part of the reinvestment period, and it is extremely unlikely
that total outflows for the entire reinvestment period approached the

III -11
magnitude of those during 1969 or 1966. New York City mutual savings
banks did not have quite as favorable a performance, but their experi-
ence during the reinvestment period, which was characterized by an
abundance of gift promotion campaigns, nevertheless suggests only modest
pressure on deposits.

Preliminary estimates indicate that deposit growth at thrift
institutions during the month of June continued to be relatively strong.
Indeed, deposit growth during the second quarter as a whole is estimated
to have exceeded a 6 per cent seasonally adjusted annual rate for the
first time since the first quarter of 1969. The recent strength in

deposit flows probably reflects increased consumer saving as well as
increased hesitancy and uncertainty among some consumers about their
own economic positions, with a consequent desire for safe and liquid
assets. Even with the new higher rate ceilings, yields on thrift insti-
tution claims during the second quarter and currently were about as

III -13
unattractive relative to market securities as they were last year when
deposit inflows were much smaller.
Savings and loan associations increased,advances from the
FHLB increased, on net, by a fairly small amount during June--less than
half of the year-earlier rate. As a consequence, FHLB System liquidity
remained high--nearly $2 billion--at midyear. The FHLB System, in its
endeavors to issue a GNMA mortgage-backed security, has already arranged
to acquire about $300 million in mortgages. This amount has not all come
out of S&L's own portfolios; the price at which the FHLB has agreed to
purchase these mortgages was somewhat above the current market and S&L's
have apparently acted to a degree like brokers by buying mortgages from
other holders at the market price and in turn selling them to the
FHLBanks at their higher price.
Mortgage market. With savings experience at the thrift
institutions relatively favorable in recent weeks, new commitments for
residential mortgages may have picked up somewhat further from the
depressed levels recorded earlier this year, judging from both agency
field reports and trade opinion. Mortgage commitment data for reporting
private lenders, however, are not yet available for June.
Apparently reflecting the improved availability of mortgage
funds from private sources, offers submitted in the July 13 auction of
FNMA's forward commitments to purchase FHA and VA mortgages remained
considerably below their weekly volume in the spring. Contributing to
the lower volume of offers received by FNMA through its regular auction

III -14
has been increased activity in the subsidized FNMA-GNMA Tandem Plan,
under which GNMA committed $25 million during June to buy FHA home
mortgages at above-market prices for later sale to FNMA at market
prices. Also, as noted, a number of S&L's have been buying FHA and VA
loans at market prices from mortgage companies for subsequent resale
to the FHLBanks at higher administratively-determined prices.
FHA and VA mortgages, in general, have continued to play a
significant role in the residential mortgage market so far in 1970.
One reason is that their average yields have remained more attractive
to lenders than returns available on conventional home loans, which are
limited in many States by usury ceilings. During June, yields on FHA
home loans remained more than 50 basis points higher than average
returns on conventional home mortgages. Although the S&L's have tradi-
tionally specialized in conventional loans, the enhanced attractiveness
of FHA and VA loans has caused these lenders to shift their investment
patterns substantially. As a result, S&L net acquisitions of Government-
underwritten mortgages through April-May continued to represent an
unusually large share of their total net mortgage takings.

For many home borrowers, Government-underwritten mortgages
have been attractive because they require much lower average down-
payments than conventional loans, although effective rates on FHA-
insured loans, which include the insurance premium, are somewhat higher.
However, the burden of monthly mortgage payments can be reduced for
eligible lower-income families under FHA's Sec. 235 program./ As much
as a sixth of all home loans underwritten by FHA so far this year have
been insured under this relatively new program.

borrowers. On these units, the HUD Secretary is authorized to make
subsidy payments to the lender in an amount necessary to make up the
difference between 20 per cent of the family's monthly income and the
required monthly mortgage payment. However, in no case may the
subsidy exceed the difference between (a) the scheduled payment under
the mortgage for principal, interest, and FHA mortgage insurance
premium and (b) the principal and interest payment that would be
required if the mortgage bore an interest rate of 1 per cent.

Corporate and municipal securities markets. A strong,
sustained rally in the corporate bond market during the latter part of
June and early July has sent yields on new high-grade issues down about
60 basis points from the mid-June peak, despite continued heavy current

and forward calendars. Because of a growing belief that monetary
policy and aggregate financial demands would ease, institutional
investors, which earlier had been anxious to build liquidity and will-
ing to invest only short-term, increased their bond purchases signifi-
cantly.
Stock prices have fluctuated in a narrow range since mid-June,
with trading volume on the NYSE averaging about 9 million shares--down
substantially from the 15 million share average of the two-week period
ending June 5. Reflecting some very recent improvement, as of July 10
the NYSE and AMEX indices were 7.3 per cent and 2.9 per cent, respec-
tively, above their 1970 lows reached at the end of May.

Public bond issues in June reached a total of slightly over
$1.9 billion, as the improved market situation in the latter part of
the month permitted accelerations and reschedulings of previously post-
poned issues. Including the mammoth AT&T financing, public bond
offerings in the second quarter of 1970 amounted to almost $7 billion,
a postwar record.
All indicators available to the staff suggest that bond
financing in the public market will continue at relatively high levels
through the third quarter of 1970 at least. July bond issues are
expected to amount to approximately $1.8 billion; and the staff esti-
mates, on the basis of current schedulings, that public bond sales will
be about $1.5 billion in August, a month when a mid-summer slump in
volume of offerings is usual. The September calendar already lists
over $1 billion in corporate bond issues, and the total for that month
is likely to be close to the $1.9 billion monthly average posted in the
first half of 1970. Thus, the third quarter volume may be around $5
billion.

III -19
While public bond offerings have been establishing new record
levels in 1970, other components of total gross security offerings have
not grown as fast. As for private placements, the staff estimates that
total volume of takedowns in the second quarter was about the same as
in the reduced January-March period. Since life insurance companies,
which are a major investor in this market, are still planning forward
commitments conservatively, takedowns are not expected to accelerate
significantly in the immediate future. New stock issues, after having
practically disappeared in late May, rebounded to an $800 million
monthly total in June. The second quarter volume, however, was only
$1.6 billion, one-fourth below the $2.1 billion of new equity offerings
in the first quarter of the year. If equity prices do not suffer
further sharp deterioration, such as the market experienced in May,
average monthly new stock issues in the third quarter of 1970 should
return to a $600-$700 million range, which would result in equity offer-
ings of approximately $2.0 billion over the three-month period. Stock
offerings by real estate investment companies, public utilities, and
corporations wishing to protect bond ratings are providing a strong base
of support to the equity total.
New long-term bond issues by State and local governments fell
somewhat below the $1.3 billion monthly average pace set in the first
three months of 1970, as the Bond Buyer index rose steadily throughout
the second quarter, remaining about 100 basis points above the 1970 low
through much of May and June. The second quarter volume was about 10
per cent below that of the first quarter, despite the heavy April sales.

III -20
Reflecting the reduced supply of municipals and the generally improved
atmosphere of the capital markets, yields began to drop sharply in
late June, and by mid-July they were over 50 basis points below the 1970
peak. Although the market situation has improved, the forward calendar
is building slowly. Interest rates are still high enough to deter small
and low-rated borrowers, and dealers report that a number of issuers
may be postponing long-term financing in the hope that rates will drop
significantly in the next few months. Nevertheless, taking into con-
sideration the pressing needs of many units, the staff estimates that
July new issue volume will be $1.1 billion, with the August total rising
to about $1.3 billion.

Government securities market. The various factors that con-
tributed to the decline in yields on high grade corporate and municipal
bonds also caused a sharp rally in the market for U.S. Government notes
and bonds during the last two weeks of June and the first week of July.
Over this time, yields on intermediate term securities dropped
around 35 basis points on average, while the average rate on long-term
bonds fell about 60 basis points. These rates, however, are still
considerably above their February-March 1970 lows, with the current
10-year rate of 7.50 per cent comparing with an earlier low of 6.90 per
cent.

In the short-term area, the 3-month bill is now bid at around
6.50 per cent, some 10 basis points below its level at the time of
the last Committee meeting. Treasury bill yields had declined further
in the latter part of June but more recently have tended to back up
slightly. The Treasury auctioned $2.5 billion of March tax anticipa-
tion bills on July 2 for payment on July 8, and announced a sale of
$2.25 billion of April tax bills on July 16 to be paid for on July 23.
In view of this large increase in supply and new competition
from CD's, a sharper rebound in bill rates might have been expected.
The relative strength in the bill market can be explained by the low
Federal funds rates and by better than seasonal investor demand--partly
reflecting a shift away from commercial paper. Consequently, total
dealer inventories have stayed relatively low in recent weeks, although
positions did increase in longer-term bills reflecting the Treasury
tab auction, and also in short-term coupon issues in anticipation of
the August refunding.

The market for Federal Agency securities has shared in the
recent over-all rally in credit markets. The volume of net new money
raised in the Agency market in recent months has continued to be much
smaller than in the first quarter of this year and also has been less
than in the same months of last year, as the following table indicates.
Borrowing by the two housing credit agencies--FHLB and FNMA--has been
running at much lower levels, as savings inflows to mortgage lenders
have improved.

Federal Finance. The Board staff now projects a budget
deficit of $9.9 billion in fiscal year 1971, about $8.6 billion more than
forecast by the Administration in its May 19 budget revisions and $2.6
billion more than assumed for the chart show presented at the last FOMC
meeting. The current staff budget estimate is compared to the chart
show assumptions and the revised Administration forecast in the table
below. The revisions made in the staff's fiscal assumptions since the

chart show have no effect on Federal purchases in the NIA accounts, as
only grants, transfers and taxes are affected.
The Treasury deficit in the current fiscal year is thus
expected to be substantially greater than was indicated by the Adminis-
tration in its May budget estimates. Thus, the staff's estimate of
fiscal 1971 receipts is nearly $5.0 billion lower than the Administra-
tions's revised estimate, partly because of lower income assumptions.
In addition, there seems little likelihood now that the tax on lead
in gasoline and the highway user tax, which were proposed by the
Administration, will be enacted by Congress as assumed in the Adminis-
tration estimates (and by the Board staff at the time of the chart show).
The staff estimate of fiscal 1970 expenditures is about $3.7
billion higher than the revised Administration estimate. The items
included in the staff projections that account for the difference
are: (1) a 5 per cent ($.7 billion) social security benefit hike
effective January 1971 and other social security reform measures
($.8 billion) that have been approved by the House and are now under
discussion in the Senate Committee; (2) larger appropriations ($.4 billion)
for direct grants for hospital construction as a result of recent
Congressional action overriding a Presidential veto of a bill extending
the Hill-Burton authorizations; (3) a projected delay in implementation
of a proposed postal rate increase (a negative expenditure) and the
retroactive feature included in the House and Senate versions of the
proposed postal pay increase (totaling $.7 billion); and (4) a higher
level of outlays for interest payments ($.5 billion) and for unemployment

III -26
insurance ($.4 billion). Uncertainties exist in regard to the
spending effect of other appropriations measures being considered by
Congress, but the Administration may be able to achieve additional
economy measures to offset possible increases initiated by Congress.
No revisions have been made by the staff in the Budget Bureau's January
estimate of defense outlays in fiscal 1971.
As for the fiscal year just completed, preliminary estimates
indicate a Budget deficit of about $3 billion, but official data will
not be available until the end of July.
With regard to the Federal sector in the national income
accounts, the staff projects a $7.3 billion deficit in calendar 1970
and an $7.7 billion deficit in fiscal 1971. The continuing shift
toward deficit in the Federal sector account is expected to end in
the third quarter of calendar 1970; thereafter the quarterly deficit
is expected to fall gradually.
The shift toward deficit in the Federal budget during
calendar 1970 is, to a large extent, the result of low levels of
projected economic growth rather than discretionary changes in fiscal
policy. Thus, despite the discretionary increases in spending included
in the staff estimate for fiscal 1971, the high employment surplus will
increase from $.7 billion to $10.6 billion from the first to the second

III -27
half of fiscal 1971.1 By this measure, fiscal policy becomes more
restrictive as the fiscal year progresses. The move toward restric-
tion reflects the anticipated speed-up in estate and gift taxes ($1.5
billion), the scheduled hike in social security taxes in January
($5.8 billion) and increased revenues that would result from the
economy growing at its potential.
The staff estimates that the end-of-July cash balance at the
Treasury will be about $6.4 billion. In its recent auction of tax
bills the Treasury raised about $2.5 billion and it has announced its
intention to raise another $2.25 billion in tax bills payable
July 23. Further cash borrowing is expected in August, either in
combination with the mid-month refinancing package for $5.6 billion
in publicly held notes and bonds or as a separate borrowing later in
the month. As indicated in the last Greenbook supplement, gross
Treasury borrowing in the third and fourth quarter of 1970 is
expected to be somewhat larger than in recent years.
1/ Since the last Greenbook the estimate of the high employment surplus
for the second half of fiscal 1971 has been lowered because of the
changed budget assumption discussed above and also because the effect
of recent Federal pay increases has been deleted in projecting the price
deflator that is applied for future periods.

THE ECONOMIC PICTURE IN DETAIL
International Developments
U.S. balance of payments. The second-quarter liquidity
deficit, seasonally adjusted and before special transactions or
SDR allocations, was apparently about $2-1/4 billion. This is
still a preliminary estimate; the deficit would have been consid-
erably greater if not for a very large inflow of funds reflected in
a reduction in bank-reported liabilities to foreigners in the last
few days of June. There was a resumption of large liquidity deficit
in the first week of July, suggesting that the inflows at the end of
June -- possibly to window-dress the direct investment reports to
the OFDI -- were at least partly temporary.
As adjusted, the first quarter liquidity deficit was $1.5
billion. For the first half of 1970 the deficit amounted to about
$3.8 billion, compared to about $5 billion in the first half of 1969.
The principal changes between the two first halves (based on partial
data and projections of an inter-agency group) appear to have been
an improvement in the balance on goods and services, a reduction
in outflows of U.S. private capital -- recorded and unrecorded --
and a substantial decline in inflows of foreign private capital in
non-liquid forms.

e/ June partly estimated.
As reported below, the trade balance has improved steadily since
the middle of last year. On balance, changes in other current accounts
(services, investment income, and military transactions) so far this
year appear to be relatively minor, nor are major shifts expected in
the year ahead though a gradual improvement is likely.
Outflows of U.S. private capital in the recorded categories
were about $1-1/4 billion in the first quarter of 1970, about the same
as in the like period of 1969, but the second-quarter recorded outflow
seems likely to be considerably less than the extraordinarily high
$2.2 billion in the second quarter of last year. The main difference --
according to the limited data available at this time -- is a reduction
in net U.S purchases of foreign securities to perhaps $50 million in

IV -3
the second quarter this year, as against net purchases of over $500
million in last year's second quarter. High interest costs in the
United States, and perhaps some action by the Canadian authorities
to avoid even larger reserve gains by discouraging local government
offerings in the United States, reduced new foreign bond issues to
a trickle. American investors have also sharply curtailed their
purchases of foreign equity securities.
Capital outflows by U.S. direct investors were very high in
the first quarter ($1.3 billion) and were probably reduced to $1
billion or less in the second, which would be close to the amount in
the second quarter of 1969. A re-survey of the companies' projected
expenditures for plant and equipment abroad (confidential until
published) suggests that the rise in 1970 over the 1969 amount will
be closer to 15 per cent than the 20 per cent projected earlier in
the year. However, this increase -- together with increasing
difficulties in obtaining funds abroad -- is still expected to
lead to larger direct investment capital outflows from the United
States this year than last.
Last year, the errors and omissions entry was much larger
than normal -- over $3 billion in the first three quarters offset by
a net reverse flow of $0.1 billion in the fourth quarter, compared
to a 1960-68 average of around $800 million per year. It is generally
assumed that the 1969 bulge contained substantial amounts of U.S. funds

IV -4
shifted into more-attractive Euro-dollar deposits, or into German
mark assets. If the transactions resulting in these flows were
easily reversed when interest differentials or the speculative
situation changed, they might properly be disregarded when computing
the underlying deficit -- i.e., they might be counted "below the
line." However, there are no signs of further reversal of the 1969
outflows since the final months of last year Large new outflows, though
on a smaller scale, seem to have developed in the second quarter of
1970, as interest rates remain somewhat higher abroad and revaluation
possibilities have probably attracted funds to Canada and to Germany.
Inflows of private foreign capital, apart from liquid funds,
have been drastically reduced so far this year. Foreign net liquidation
of U.S. corporate stocks was about $100 million in the first quarter,
then, after a pause in April, net sales reached a peak of $200 million
in May. Indications are that there was only a small net sell-off in
June. For the first six months of the year foreign transactions in
U.S. equity securities resulted in net outflows of about $350 million,
compared with inflows of $900 million in the first half of 1969.
The foreign market for debt issues of U.S. corporations has
become extremely tight and is not likely to ease appreciably, given
both strong competing demands for funds abroad and general uneasiness --
at least at the moment -- about the liquidity problems of U.S.
corporations.

IV -5
The deficit on the official settlements basis (seasonally
adjusted and before certain special transactions) was reduced to
about $2.3 billion in the second quarter (according to preliminary
data) from over $3 billion in the first. In the previous quarter
this balance was worsened by net repayment of $1.5 billion in
liquid liabilities to commercial banks abroad, whereas incomplete
data for the second quarter indicate a reduction of only about $150
million in such liabilities. This reflected a slowdown in the runoff
of borrowings of U S. banks via their Euro-dollar branches; such
borrowings were reduced (net) by $1.1 billion in the first quarter,
but changed very little in the second, with increases early in the
quarter offset later, especially after the change in Regulation Q.
Total reserves of foreign monetary authorities appear to
have increased as much in the second quarter as in the first, despite
the slight lessening in the U.S. official settlements deficit. In the
first quarter the BIS appears to have placed its net increase in
dollar assets (derived largely from transactions with central banks)
in the United States; but in the second quarter the BIS apparently
shifted substantial amounts from the United States to the Euro-dollar
market.
The counterpart of the $5 billion official settlements
deficit (unadjusted) of the United States in the first half of 1970
was large reserve gains by a number of countries. Net reserves of

IV -6
the U.K. improved by $2.3 billion, concentrated in the early months
of the year. German gains were $1.7 billion, largely in June, not
including forward purchases of dollars. Canadian reserves increased
by $1.2 billion, mainly in the second quarter, and were invested in
special U.S. Treasury issues; French reserves increased by about
$300 million. Offsetting these gains, Italian reserves declined by
over $600 million, despite massive Euro-dollar borrowings that came
into Italian reserves.
Financing of the $5 billion first-half deficit was
accomplished mainly by reducing U.S. official holdings of foreign
currencies -- principally sterling -- by $1.8 billion, while foreign
reserve holders increased their liquid and nonliquid assets held
in the United States by about $3.5 billion. On the whole, the
composition of the reserve gainers, and the method of financing,
have tended up to now to mitigate the tensions that might be
associated with such large deficits.
U.S. foreign trade. In May, the export surplus increased
as exports rose more than imports. For April-May together, the
export surplus was at an annual rate of $2.6 billion (balance of
payments basis) compared with $2.1 billion in the first quarter
and $1.5 billion in the last half of 1969.
The steady improvement in the trade balance since mid-1969
stems from an accelerated rate of increase in exports. Imports also
rose over this period but at a more moderate rate. The expansion in

IV -7
exports has been led by greater shipments of industrial materials --
steel, coal, aluminum, ferrous scrap and chemicals -- to foreign
industrial countries where output has advanced sharply. Deliveries
of commercial aircraft have also been much greater, bolstered by the
beginning of deliveries of the new Boeing 747's. Exports of machinery
have been relatively disappointing, particularly in view of the increase
in fixed investment outlays abroad. Although exports of agricultural
commodities have increased only slightly since mid-1969, the absolute
level has been exceptionally high throughout this period. In the 12-
months ended last June shipments of agricultural products are estimated
to have totaled $6.6 billion, the third largest amount for a comparable
period.
By areas, about three-fourths of the increase in exports
from the last half of 1969 to January-May 1970 was in shipments to
Western Europe and Japan. There was a particularly large rise in
exports to the EEC countries, principally Germany and France, and
shipments to the United Kingdom were also up substantially. Exports
to the Latin American countries also advanced this year but exports
to Canada showed little change, reflecting the easing of demand in
that country.
Imports have displayed surprising strength so far this year.
In contrast to previous domestic economic slowdowns, the absolute
level of imports has remained high relative to domestic output and

IV -8
consumption. Higher prices for nonferrous metals and coffee, and
perhaps purchases of foreign goods in anticipation of the imposition
of restrictions on imports may partly explain the high level of
imports. But there is probably also a shift of U.S. consumer and
business demand toward the purchase of lower-cost goods, including
imports, to offset pressures on incomes and profits. A corresponding
shift in purchasing patterns probably also occurred in past slowdowns,
but since imports of finished goods -- automobiles and other consumer
goods in particular -- now have a greater weight than before, such a
shift may be a more important element in maintaining imports.
Exports in April-May were at a $42.0 billion annual rate
(balance of payments basis), nearly 3 per cent greater than in the
first quarter. The increase was principally in nonagricultural
commodities; shipments of agricultural products rose only slightly
above the very high amounts exported in the first quarter. The gain
in nonagricultural commodities was broadly based. Deliveries of
automotive equipment to Canada were larger as automotive output
there rose to record levels, buoyed by the heavy U.S. demand for
compact cars which make up a large portion of Canadian car output.
Deliveries of commercial aircraft were also up strongly, principally
because of a bunching in deliveries of the Boeing 747's in May.
Deliveries of these aircraft are scheduled to be lower in the second
half of the year.

IV -9
Exports of industrial materials, particularly steel, ferrous
scrap and coal, were all up sharply in response to continued strong
demand in foreign industrial countries. Steel exports in May topped
900,000 tons -- an exceptionally high amount -- and the backlog of
foreign orders suggests further gains in the immediate future. In
the first five months of this year, exports of steel were at an
annual rate of over 9 million tons compared with 5-1/2 million tons
in calendar 1969. There has not been a commensurate increase in value,
however, since much of the increase in tonnage consists of lower-priced
semi-finished steel. The average unit-value of steel exports dropped
to $150 million a ton this year compared with the average $170 per ton
in 1969. Imports of steel in the first five months of the year were at
an annual rate of 10-1/2 million tons; in 1969 imports totaled nearly
14 million tons. In contrast to the export pattern, however, there has
been a shift toward higher-priced foreign steel; the unit-value in
January-May 1970 was $157 per ton; in 1969 it was $125 per ton. Net
imports of steel in January-May 1970 were valued at about $200 million
(annual rate) compared with $800 million for the year 1969.
Exports of machinery, after falling in April, rose in May
to the first quarter level. The gains in shipments of such products,
however, have been relatively modest. With the estimated cutbacks
in domestic plant and equipment expenditures from the earlier estimates,
and continued high capacity-utilization rates in manufacturing abroad,

IV -10
a more rapid rise in exports of machinery may materialize in the second
half of this year.
Imports in April-May were at an annual rate of $39.4 billion
(balance of payments basis), less than 2 per cent above the rate in
the first quarter. However, imports in May were very strong following
three months in which imports were virtually unchanged. Despite the
sharp rise in May, it is still expected that imports in the immediate
future will increase only slightly. One reason for this expectation
is the stabilization in prices of imported nonferrous metals and coffee.
The decline in quotations on the London Metal Exchange, particularly
for copper, and the announced reduction in domestic lead prices should
be transmitted to import prices, reversing the uptrend which had occurred
in such prices through the first part of this year, and should dampen
the rise in the value of imports later in the year.
The increase in imports in April-May over the first quarter
level was largely in cars from Europe and Japan as sales of these
types in the United States continued at record-breaking levels. There
was also some increase in inventories of newly introduced models,
Arrivals of foodstuffs (coffee and sugar) were also higher, as were
imports of clothing and footwear. A survey by a Washington-based
newsletter indicates that domestic retailers were buying abroad
heavily in anticipation of the possible imposition of quotas on

U.S. banks' liabilities to their own foreign branches declined
by about $640 million in the two weeks subsequent to the Regulation Q
action, to a level of $12.2 billion (including loan participations).
German banks, according to data supplied by the Bundesbank, increased
their net foreign liabilities by almost $500 million in the last three
weeks of June, but did not increase their net liabilities substantially
in the early part of July. However, there were large inflows to German
reserves in early July, presumably reflecting some use of Euro-dollar
financing by German non-banks.

IV -12
The fairly large official reserve losses by the Italians in
early July reflected an outflow of funds, part of which may have
gone into the Euro-dollar market. In addition, the absence of Euro-
dollar borrowings by Italian state-owned corporations in recent weeks,
following heavy borrowing earlier, removed some of the upward pressure
on rates.
For the four-week reserve computation period ending July 8,
there was apparently little change in total reserveable Euro-dollar
borrowings of U.S. banks from their foreign branches. (These
reserveable borrowings had averaged $1.6 billion for the computation
period ended June 10.) In the last two weeks of the computation period,
the two banks which had the largest "excess" borrowings, amounting to
nearly one-half of all reserveable borrowings, reduced these borrowings
significantly.
Foreign exchange markets. Since June 22 the major activity
in foreign exchange markets has centered on the German mark, Italian
lira and pound sterling. Demand for the mark has been quite strong --
reflecting very tight monetary conditions in Germany and since July 8
some speculative demand generated by talk of wider margins or a floating
D-mark rate. The Italian lira, on the other hand, came under severe
selling pressure following the Government's resignation July 6.
Sterling has also experienced moderate selling pressure, reflecting the
attractiveness of higher interest rates abroad and more recently growing

IV -13
concern about possible strikes in Britain and the increase in the
trade deficit.
The Bundesbank Council raised its minimum reserve requirement
for German banks by 15 per cent -- or an estimated $825 million equivalent --
on July 1, having announced two weeks earlier that this action would be
taken. Demand for the mark was already strong because of very favorable
interest rate differentials -- both on a covered and an uncovered basis.
The mark exchange rate remained at or close to its upper limit until
July 8 and the Bundesbank purchased $700 million between June 30 and
that date. Since June 1 the Bundesbank has purchased spot $1.7 billion
and about $.5 billion on a three-months forward basis.
The slight easing of the mark rate since July 8 may have
been partly a reaction to announcement of the government's proposed
fiscal measures, including a 10 per cent personal and corporate income
surtax (to be refunded at a later date). This fiscal action has lead to
some easing of the very restrictive monetary policy, principally a decrease
of the discount rate on July 15.
Selling pressure on the Italian lira -- which had been rather
heavy early in June -- moderated toward the end of the month and the
Bank of Italy was able to recoup some of its earlier losses, reducing
its total market losses for June to $200 million.(Italy had a slight
balance of payments surplus in June.) Selling pressure on the lira
resumed after July 1 and grew heavier following the Government's
resignation July 6. So far in July the Bank of Italy has sold $279

IV -14
million in exchange markets, $226 million in one week -- its largest
weekly loss since mid-February. However, the Bank of Italy repaid
entirely its $400 million of swap drawings on the System in early
July, obtaining dollars by transferring a $250 million claim on the
IMF to Japan, selling $50 million of SDR's, redeeming in advance a
$68 million lira note purchased from Canada in 1968 and redeeming at
maturity an $85 million medium-term U.S. Treasury note. In addition,
it replenished official reserves with proceeds of a $100 million
Euro-dollar borrowing of the Italian public works consortium. The
Bank of Italy will acquire further resources this week by selling
the remainder of its claim on the IMF under the GAB and drawing its
super-gold tranche.
Demand for sterling has weakened moderately since June 22,
reflecting the pull of high interest rates outside the U.K., concern
over growing labor unrest, and -- more recently -- reactions to a higher
trade deficit for June -- £51 million, compared with £32 million in
May (seasonally adjusted, balance of payments basis). The Bank of
England has let the rate take most of the selling pressure and has
intervened only moderately, selling $75 million so far in July. (It
purchased $200 million net during June.) The sterling rate has fallen
to about $2.39 from $2.3990 on June 22.
Demand for other major foreign currencies has been firm.
The Bank of France completed repayment of its dollar borrowings from
French commercial banks during June. (It still has outstanding a

IV -15
$987 million drawing on the IMF.) On July 8 it raised the reserve
requirements of French commercial banks, citing as the reason its
desire to offset the expansionary effects of the "growing inflow
of U.S. dollars."
The National Bank of Belgium purchased a small amount of
dollars in late June and early July and asked the System to provide
cover on $30 million by drawing on the swap line. The only other
drawings the System has outstanding is $185 million on the Swiss
National Bank.
The Canadian dollar exchange rate climbed from 96.06 in
late June to a recent high of 96.95 on July 3. The Bank of Canada
made small U.S. dollar purchases to moderate the rate climb. More
recently the rate eased to 96.65 and the Bank of Canada sold a
small amount of dollars.

IV -16
Economic activity in major industrial countries. Economic
activity in Continental Europe in the first half of 1973 appears to
have been virtually unaffected by government efforts to curb inflationary
pressures. But the cumulative effects of policy measures taken in
1969 and so far this year are likely to have some impact on the pace
of activity in the second half of this year. In France and Germany
output increased rapidly during the first half of the year. In both
countries export demand and capital investment have been buoyant,
and in Germany consumption expenditures have also contributed to the
boom. In France there are now indications that growth has begun to
slacken, prompting the authorities early this month to ease monetary
policy moderately and release funds for public works expenditures
during the rest of the year. In Germany, on the other hand, monetary
policy remains tight and further deflationary fiscal measures were
adopted early this month. This fiscal action was mainly taken with
an eye towards moderating the size of wage increases this autumn.
Further monetary measures, insofar as they raised interest rates,
would be counterproductive by serving only to attract capital flows
from abroad. A moderate slowing of the German expansion should
develop during the remainder of the year.
Elsewhere in Europe, Italian output recovered sharply in
January from the low level of activity at the end of last year, when
the economy was hard hit by strikes. Since then, however, industrial

IV -17
production has been flat, not, apparently, because of deficient
demand, but because of further labor troubles and problems associated
with the introduction of a shorter work week and with putting back
into operation equipment that had been idled by strikes.
The behavior of the British economy has been surprising.
The recovery which began in the latter half of 1969 had been expected
to continue this year. Instead, gross domestic product fell in the first
quarter, and there are no indications that an upturn took place in
the second quarter. The economy faltered largely because of a fall in
capital investment occasioned by a shortage of credit and high interest
rates. Despite the drop in output, wages and prices rose rapidly in
Britain. This prevented -- and probably will continue to prevent -- the
authorities from significantly easing monetary and fiscal stringency.
However, growth is expected to resume in the current half.

In Japan, output grew at about the same rate in the first
half of 1970 as in 1969. However, delayed impact of the restrictive
monetary measures adopted last year may slow the rate of growth during
the balance of the year.
In Canada, the very rapid expansion of output which began
in the fourth quarter -- following the termination of strikes in
major industries -- continued through February. Economic activity
subsequently leveled off. Recent steps to ease monetary policy
may lead to a revival of growth later in the year.
German productive capacity has been employed at very
high levels for over a year now and the labor shortage is again acute,
despite the fact that the number of foreign workers in Germany
has now risen to an all-time high of over 1.8 million, or 8 per cent
of the labor force. Policy measures -- including the revaluation
last October which allowed monetary policy to become severely
restrictive to aid a moderately restraining fiscal policy -- thus
far failed to slow the pace of economic expansion significantly.
Though new industrial orders decreased steadily from February through
May, the decline was moderate and the backlog of orders remains large.
Fixed capital investment, personal consumption, and
exports have all contributed to a sustained high level of demand.
Efforts to overcome capacity shortages coupled with the strong profit
position of German industry explain the high level of investment
activity. The strength in consumption reflects both the continuation

IV -19
of the boom and the generous wage increases recently awarded in
many sectors of the economy. The buoyancy of exports is attributable
in part to the inevitable lag between the revaluation of the German
mark and the full impact of the change in parity on deliveries of
German goods to foreign customers.
Mirroring the overall vigor of the Germany economy is the
8 per cent, annual rate, rise in industrial production from September-
December 1969 to January-April 1970, which occurred despite a sharp
and probably anomalous drop from March to April. (Preliminary data
indicate a rise in May above the March level.) To moderate the
expansion of aggregate demand, Federal and local governments have
postponed expenditures, thus preventing an appreciable rise in
public sector outlays.
The German authorities remain concerned about inflation,
particularly since the German boom has moved into the state of cost-
push inflation. Unit labor costs in industry, which had been falling
steadily from early 1967 to mid-1969, in January-April, 1970, were
12 per cent above the level of the corresponding period in 1969.
And upcoming wage negotiations in autumn are likely to involve
further large increases as labor seeks to hold its real share of
national income.
Retail prices in May were about 4 per cent higher than a
year ago and producers' prices for industrial products were up 6 per
cent.

IV -20
The need to give some credibility to the projected lessening
of the rate of inflation -- which in Germany will play an important
role in the wage negotiations -- may have led those German officials
who feel that the boom has already passed its peak to agree to the
need, nevertheless, for the new anti-inflationary measures. Early
in July, the government attempted to shift private expenditures from
this year into next by suspending accelerated depreciation allowances
through January 1971, and by imposing a 10 per cent prepayment on
personal and corporate income taxes. The cumulative effect of
these restrictive measures should slow the advance of both real
growth and inflation during the balance of the year. The deceleration
is not likely to be great, however, in view of the backlog of orders
and the likelihood that wage increases will continue to be substantial.
Now that fiscal policy has been made more restrictive, the
German authorities also have more latitude to change the fiscal-
monetary policy mix. On July 15, the Bundesbank reduced the discount
rate from 7 1/2 to 7 per cent and the "Lombard" rate from 9 1/2 to 9
per cent.
In France, the volume of economic activity in 1970 has
exceeded earlier expectations, because of unexpectedly high invest-
ment and export demand. Benefiting from the devaluation of the franc,
the value of French exports rose at an annual rate of about 40 per
cent from September-December to January-April. Fixed investment,
despite elimination of special tax benefits last year, has been at so
high a level thus far this year that the 1970 over 1969 increase, it
has been suggested, could reach 20 per cent in real terms.

IV -21
Government policies have succeeded in halting growth in
consumption, however. Real consumption has been running slightly
below the levels of last spring; and during 1970, consumer outlays
have been flat, indicating a decline in volume.
Acknowledgment that the Government had underestimated the
strength of aggregate demand in France came in May, when Finance
Minister Giscard d'Estaing announced that the 1969 to 1970 increase
in GNP was now expected to be 6 per cent (real terms), rather than 4 per
cent, as forecast in October. Industrial production during the first
four months of the year was almost 4 per cent higher than in the
last four months of 1969. Inflation has also been higher than
anticipated last autumn, with consumer prices, for example, having
risen at an annual rate of 6 per cent this year as compared with the
4 per cent annual rate predicted in October.
There are some indications that the economy is cooling off.
A mid-June INSEE poll indicates that a majority of businessmen expect
a marked slowdown in activity in the second half of the year. This
may explain why the authorities eased credit restrictions at the
beginning of July and then released the equivalent of $200 million
of the anti-cyclical fund for public works expenditures in the
second half of this year. Since last fall, both monetary and fiscal
policy have been tight, the only previous instance of relaxation having
been a slight easing of stringent installment buying regulations in
February.

IV -22
Recovery in Italy from the sharp drop in economic activity
last autumn -- when production was crippled by strikes -- has been
below expectations. Industrial production, which in the fourth quarter
plunged 11 per cent below the peak level of June-July 1969, rose only
3 per cent above that peak in the first quarter. There was a sharp
rebound in January, but this was followed by a leveling off in February
and March.
The economy's disappointing performance appears to have
been the result of the following factors, none of them related to
lagging demand: (a) additional strikes, notably in textiles and
electric power; (b) difficulties experienced by some firms in adjusting
to a new shorter work week; (c) difficulties, particularly in steel,
in putting equipment back into operation; and (d) insufficient capacity
in some industries, causing production problems elsewhere.
Underlying demand appears to be strong. Consumer expenditures
should receive considerable impetus from the large wage settlements of
recent months, most of which were effective January 1 but some of
which took effect in March. Minimum contractual wage rates in manu-
facturing rose by 12 per cent from December to March, to a level
22 per cent above a year earlier. Expenditures for plant and equip-
ment are believed to be rising quite strongly, but so far there does
not seem to have been any rebuilding of strike-depleted inventories.

IV -23
Exports rose sharply in January, but fell below the January
level in the following three months. In March-April, they were only
5.7 per cent above a year earlier, a small increase compared with
other European countries. Export growth has lagged because of supply
shortages, and imports have grown at a healthy pace both because of
a shortage of domestic supply and rising aggregate demand.
Gross domestic product in the United Kingdom fell by 1 per
cent in real terms from the fourth to the first quarter, reversing a
rise of slightly over 1 per cent from the third to the fourth quarter.
The decline was attributable to a drop in industrial investment,
which was off by about 3 per cent in manufacturing and about 4 per
cent in the distributive and service industries. Personal consumption
expenditures, exports, government expenditures and inventory accu-
mulation (all in real terms) were virtually flat between the two
quarters. Sketchy data for the second quarter suggest little, if
any, gain in total output has taken place since the first quarter.
The fall in investment, which surveys of businessmen's
intentions early in the year had indicated would rise appreciably this
year, is attributable to the lack of bank credit and high interest
rates, which have discouraged new securities issues. The failure
of real consumption to expand despite an extremely rapid rate of
increase in wage and salary earnings is a reflection of how closely
price rises have been keeping pace with wage rises. Weekly wage

IV -24
rates rose by 3.6 per cent from December to May; consumer prices in
the same period rose by 3.8 per cent. Economic activity has also
been retarded by an unusually large number of strikes.
Economic growth is likely to resume in the second half,
though the rate of increase may be below the 3.5 per cent annual
rate forecast by the late Labor Government in its April budget
presentation. Investment may remain depressed, but, judging by data
on orders, exports should increase. And, with prices likely to rise
less rapidly in the coming months for seasonal reasons, a pickup
in real consumption is to be expected also.
It is unlikely that the government will significantly
stimulate demand in the immediate future. The Conservatives owe
their election victory in large measure to their attacks against
inflation under Labor. They are thus in a position where they must
do something about inflationary cost pressures before they can risk
any substantial easing of fiscal and monetary policy.
The Japanese economy appears to have grown in the first
half at about the 11 per cent rate achieved during 1969. Industrial
production in January-May was 10 per cent above the same period in
1969. Both consumption and investment demand have remained strong.
Exports have increased this year at a rapid rate, though somewhat more
slowly than last year.

IV -25
There is evidence that the tight money measures instituted
in September are at last having some impact. Credit expansion has
slowed slightly, bankruptcies have increased, and prices have recently
either been advancing at a slower rate or have actually fallen. The
rate of growth in total output may be slightly lower during the
balance of the year.
Real Canadian GNP increased by almost 7 per cent, annual
rate, from the fourth to the first quarter. The main source of
growth was exports, which rose in real terms by 36 per cent, annual rate,
from the preceding quarter. The surge in exports was attributable
mainly to strong demand for raw materials by industrialized countries.
The other important contributor to expansion was current government
expenditures, which were up, in real terms, by about 16 per cent,
annual rate, from October-December.
Real consumer expenditures, on the other hand, declined --
by about 3 1/2 per cent -- as did real gross fixed investment -- off
by 16 per cent, both figures at annual rates. In the investment sector
both business plant and equipment spending and outlays on residential
housing dropped.
Preliminary data for the second quarter indicate that there
was little change in total output from the first quarter. Consumption
expenditures appear to have remained about the same, while rises in
government spending and business capital investment were roughly
offset by decreases in housing and exports.

IV -26
Indicative of flattening out in economic activity was a
marked decline in bank loans from February to May, despite a move
by the authorities in the direction of monetary ease. A pronounced
slowdown in the rate of increase in prices in recent weeks also
implies that a slowdown is taking place.
The economy is likely to follow a level course during the
third quarter. Assuming no decline in U. S. demand, increased con-
sumer expenditures and a rise in residential construction -- owing
to the availability of more mortgage funds because of easier money --
may lead to an upturn in the latter part of the year.

APPENDIX A: SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS OF THE EMERGENCY HOME FINANCE ACT
OF 1970*
On June 25, the House of Representatives passed its version
of the Emergency Home Finance Act of 1970 (H.R. 16495). The Senate,
almost two months earlier, had passed a somewhat different version
of the same Act (S. 3685). With the Senate-House Conference Committee
now attempting to resolve the differences between the two measures,
the staff felt tht a summary of the major provisions of the Acts and
a brief analysis of their possible impact on the mortgage and housing
markets would be in order,
Taken together, the major provisions of the Emergency Home
Finance Act of 1970 appear to promise only marginal additional support
to the mortgage market in the short run. Although the ultimate long-
run impact of the Act is at this time difficult to predict, its
potential may be quite significant. Changes in the institutional
framework as well as greater standardization of conventional mortgages
and establishment of secondary trading facilities should improve both
the primary and secondary market for such loans. However, the final
benefit derived from the Act will depend in large measure on the
extent to which FNMA develops its role in the conventional mortgage
market and on the willingness of the Congress to expand and extent
the Title V provisions.
The following are considered to be the five most important
provisions of the Proposed Emergency Home Finance Act of 1970: 1/
* Prepared by Fred Taylor, Economist, Capital Markets Section,
Division of Research and Statistics.
1/ In addition to these five major provisions the acts also provide
for (a) an increased appropriation to GNMA, (b) the extension of
the flexible rate authority of FHA and VA mortgages, (c) the
establishment of a Special Advisory Commission on Housing,
(d) prescribed standards to govern the establishment of locally
uniform settlement costs, (e) changes in the geographic limitation
of S&L business activity, as well as lesser provisions dealing
with S&L's, national banks, and a number of technical changes in
the National Housing Act.

A -2
Title I -(In both the House and Senate versions) Reduction
of Interest Charges for Members of the Federal
Home Loan Bank System.
Authorizes the appropriation of $250 million to
the Federal Home Loan Bank Board for the purpose of sub-
sidizing the interest rate on either short- or long-term
FHLBank advances. The FHLBB is to establish the amount of
the subsidy and the maximum rate at which system members
may relend these funds. The loans made by savings and loan
associations using these subsidized funds would be limited
to either new or used residential structures for low and
middle-income families. The maximum loan amounts would
correspond to the limits applicable to mortgages under the
FHA Section 203(b) or 207(for a single family unit the
current level is $33,000). Each FHLB District would be
limited to no more than 20 per cent of the funds
appropriated.
According to a Federal Home Loan Bank Board estimate, the
implementation of the $250 million subsidy program could provide
financing for an additional 240,000 new and existing dwellings over
the balance of this year. However, given the current improved rate
of savings inflows to S&Ls, the fact that associations holding only
about 20 per cent of the industry's total assets appear likely to expand
their borrowing at this time, and with the peak building season
passed, this estimate in the staff's views may overstate the actual gross
impact of this program on the short period left this year. Moreover,
in view of the fact that a number of associations are unable to lend out
their current inflows fully due to the low level of housing activity
and buyer resistance to high interest rates, the number of associations
which may be expected to take advantage of this program are limited.
Finally, the net impact of the program will undoubtedly be less than
gross, as financing is shifted from non-eligible to eligible loans.
Although we feel that the program's immediate potential is
below that forecast by the FHLBB staff, any real analysis is not now
possible because the Federal Home Loan Bank Board has not as yet
developed a plan to implement this section of the Emergency Home
Finance Act.

A-3
Title II -(In both the Senate and the House Acts) Authority
for the Federal National Mortgage Association
to provide a secondary market for conventional
mortgages.
This title amends the National Housing Act to
permit FNMA to deal in conventional residential mortgages
within certain established limits. These limits include
(1) the size of the mortgage purchased may not exceed the
limits applicable to FHA Section 203(b) or 207 ($33,000)
and (2) no more than 10 per cent of the conventional
mortgage portfolio can be comprised of loans originated
more than one year prior to the FNMA purchase date. Further
more, the outstanding principal balance of any mortgage
may not be greater than 75 per cent of the assessed value
of the property unless (a) the seller retains at least a
10 per cent participation in the loan, (b) the seller
agrees to repurchase or replace the mortgage if a default
occurs within three years of the purchase date, or (c) any
unpaid principal in excess of 75 per cent is underwritten
by a qualified private insurer.
It is now anticipated that any short-run impact of the FNMA
move into the conventional market will be delayed by the reluctance
of HUD and FNMA officials to enter this market at this time. Moreover,
FNMA must establish the initial machinery, as well as minimum mortgage
purchase requirements, in order to implement their activity in this
area. In addition to the delays, FNMA seems likely to be unwilling
to purchase conventional mortgages in approximately 20 states because
of current usury laws which preclude FNMA from receiving a positive
yield spread in relation to their average borrowing costs.
Although this program currently appears limited,it may possess the
potential to have an important salutary influence on the level of mortgage
activity in the long run. However, much will depend on the emphasis
FNMA attaches to this segment of its operations, as well as the
corporations' future budget limitations. In any event, FNMA's entrance
into the conventional mortgage market should help to standardize
the conventional mortgage. Once FNMA establishes minimum purchase
requirements for conventional home loans, such standards may well be
adopted by a major portion of the nation's lenders. As a result,
trading in conventional home loans should be made somewhat easier,
to the extent that the heterogeneity of the conventional mortgage
resulted from lender actions and not from State laws.

A-4
Title III -(Included in both the House and Senate versions)
Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation
Established the Federal Home Loan Mortgage
Corporation under the control of the Federal Home Loan
Bank Board to operate in the secondary market for
conventional residential mortgages. The Corporation
is to be financed through the sale of capital stock to
the FHL Banks (up to $100 million), through its indepen-
dent authority to borrow, and through the issuance of
GNMA mortgage-backed securities. The limitations on
the type of loans eligible for purchase by the Corpora-
tion from an insured institution are the same as those
prescribed for FNMA under Title II.
In developing the framework of the Federal Home Loan Mortgage
Corporation (FHLMC), the Federal Home Loan Bank Board faces short-run
problems similar to those confronting FNMA. However, the FHLMC may
be somewhat more inclined than FNMA to absorb a lower yield spread,
caused by the restrictive state usury ceilings, in order to support
the conventional mortgage market.
In the initial stages of its operation the FHLB Board will
transfer to the Corporation the FHLBanks' program of buying Govern-
ment underwritten mortgages from member institutions in order to market
GNMA mortgage-backed securities. However, this program, which is
designed to attract funds from non-traditional mortgage sources, may
be restricted in the future by the limited quantity of qualified
loans held by the associations.
Through its participation in the conventional mortgage market,
the FHLMC, as with FNMA, is expected to encourage standardization of
the conventional mortgage instrument. The Corporation's activity in
the conventional market may also stimulate some savings and loans,
which in the past have failed to take advantage of the FHLBank
advances, to increase their'local lending activity through the sale
of loans to the Corporation. Thus, by the use of the mechanism of
the Corporation, the FHLB Board will in future periods of reduced
mortgage credit availability be in a somewhat better position to
pump funds directly into the conventional home loan market. Because
the FHLMC has no resources to provide funds to support its activity,
any massive support by the Corporation would have to be financed
through the sale of a large volume of its securities. Although this
could increase pressures in the capital markets and may result in
raising the interest rates on all housing-oriented Federal agency

A-5
issues, perhaps bringing about some disintermediation at the thrift
institttions the offset would not be complete.
Title V -(In the Senate measure only) Funds for financing
middle-income housing.
Provides an initial appropriation of $60 million
to subsidize the purchase of mortgages for middle-income
by FNMA and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation.
The appropriation is to be increased by an additional $60
million in each of the two following fiscal years, up to
a maximum annual allotment of $180 million in fiscal 1973.
Appropriations in subsequent years would fund subsidy
payments on those loans purchased, up to the maximum
$180 million annual level, and could continue for up to
30 years. The interest rate paid by the borrower would be
derived by applying 20 per cent of family income toward
the payment of principal, interest, taxes, property insurance,
and mortgage insurance premiums, but in no case less than
7 per cent, including all discounts. The interest subsidy
payments to FNMA and the FNLMC would equal the difference
between the amount of interest collected from the mortgages
per quarter and the amount of interest the investor
(FNMA or the FHLMC) would have received had the yield been
equal to the agency's average borrowing costs in the
preceding quarter, (plus a fee to cover the administration
costs if the Secretary of HUD deems this necessary). The
subsidy payments would be adjusted quarterly, over the life
of the mortgage, to reflect changes in the institution's
average borrowing cost. In order to quality for a loan
under this program, the income of the family could not
exceed the median income of the area in which the
property is located. Down payments for all loans,
whether FHA or conventional, would comply with FHA require-
ments (3 per cent on the first $15,000 of property
value; 10 per cent of value between $15,000 and $25,000;
and 20 per cent of value in excess of $25,000). The
program would be limited almost entirely to new one-
family or condominium housing units with an appraised
value of $30,000 or less. No new purchases could be
made by FNMA or the FHIC after June 30, 1973.

A-6
The "Proxmire" proposal would indeed allow a number of below-
the market rate loans to be made to low-to-middle income families,
subsequently purchased by either FNMA or the FHLMC. This Title
does not increase the ability of either institution to raise the volume
of their purchases. However, since the borrower's income limits
for these loans are relatively liberal (not in excess of the median
income of the area in which the property is located) and the funds
available modest, the complex problem of rationing will arise.
The subsidy payment formula which is based on the average
borrowing cost to the Agency in the preceding quarter increases the
cost of the program to these Agencies in periods of rising rates. I
basing the formula on the average borrowings costs instead of the
marginal cost, the program further understates the cost to the
purchasing institution. As a result of the additional costs which
the corporation would have to absorb to accommodate this program
during periods of rising borrowing rates, the net result could be
an actual reduction in the volume of loans purchased during these
periods. However, if agency borrowing costs decline over the longer
run, the reverse effect would occur, increasing the funds available
for mortgage purchases by the two agencies involved. Here again
the long-run potential of this Title may exceed its short-run impact,
depending upon what the Congress decides to do.
Title VII -(In the House passed Act only) Investment
of Commercial Bank Reserves.
Amends the Federal Reserve Act to give the Federal
Reserve Board discretionary authority to allow member
banks to invest a designated portion of their required
reserves in Federal agency obligations issued to finance'
construction or mortgage loans on residential properties.
As formulated, this provision of the Act is likely to provide
little additional support to either the mortgage or housing markets.
Because Federal agency issues are good substitutes for Treasury
and other securities, as a consequence of even a very small drop in
their yield brought on by the expansion of member banks purchases,
other investors would shift from housing-oriented securities and
into substitute assets. Although banks would be willing to accept
any positive yield on these reserve assets, even a minimal decline
in their yield, below existing market rates, should cause other

A- 7
investors to relinquish their participation in this segment of the
capital market. Therefore, since the volume of securities offered
will depend not only on the yield required but also the agency's desire
to support the housing and mortgage markets, the probable end
result of this Title would be the creation of a subsidy for
commercial banks, with only a minimal reduction in the interest
rates paid by Federal agencies which support the housing market.
Because of the limited reduction in the rates which are expected,
this Title should have only a marginal impact on the inflows of
thrift institutions.
If we assume that member banks would acquire agency securities
as reserve assets up to the limits specified by the Board, then in
subsequent periods of monetary restraint--when reserves rise slowly--
the banks would be able to acquire only a small amount of these
securities as reserve assets. If the Board authorized a change in
the ratio of agency issues to total required reserves this could
offset to some extent the slow growth. However, since the System
would presumably wish to maintain the same overall growth in total
reserves, the increased bank purchases of agency securities would be
at the expense of banks acquiring other assets--including mortgages.
