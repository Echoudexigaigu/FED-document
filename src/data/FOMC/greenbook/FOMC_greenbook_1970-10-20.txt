SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK
Nonfinancial
The overall performance of the economy last quarter was
sluggish. Real GNP apparently increased slightly less, than the quite
modest rise we had previously projected. The GM strike, beginning in
mid-September, contributed to the weakness in activity later in the
quarter. On balance, upward price pressures appear to have lessened a
bit.
Industrial production declined 1.7 per cent further in
September. The General Motors strike accounted for about two-thirds of
this but reductions were widespread in sectors not affected by the
strike, including both business and defense equipment, some nonautomo-
tive consumer goods, and a number of materials. The September index is
nearly 5 per cent below the high of July 1969, while business equipment
is down 10 per cent from its October 1969 high. Retail sales in
September were unchanged from August and for the third quarter as a
whole were less than 1 per cent above the second quarter.
New orders for durable goods for July-August were up 5 per
cent from the second quarter average, and orders for capital equipment
leveled out following earlier declines. The durable goods backlog,
however, has declined further. Book values of business inventories in
July and August increased at a far more rapid rate than in the second
quarter, suggesting the possibility of some involuntary accumulation.
The composite of 12 leading indicators declined in August after two
months of increase.

I-2
The labor market turned out to be very weak this past summer.
The unemployment rate rose to 5.5 per cent in September from 5.1 per
cent in August. Preliminary nonfarm employment estimates for July and
August were revised down sharply and although employment in September
remained at the August level, the average for the quarter was down
436,000, with declines widespread. The manufacturing workweek was off
further in September. Output per manhour in the private nonfarm economy
apparently increased appreciably for the second consecutive quarter.
Large swings in prices of farm products recently have resulted
in an uneven pattern of change in the wholesale price index, with
September up sharply. Average prices of industrial commodities have
increased at a fairly even pace--somewhat slower over the third than
the second quarter. The marked slowing of the rise in consumer prices
from May to August provides some basis for optimism with respect to
progress against inflation. Retail food prices are still expected to
continue to change relatively little over the remainder of this year,
notwithstanding the reduction in the corn crop because of the corn
blight. But substantially higher prices of 1971 model autos will impart
an upward fillip to the CPI in October and probably November as well.
Outlook. The weakness evident in recent economic data adds
support to the prospect of a relatively slow recovery in economic activity.
Consumer expenditures have been sluggish and inventory data imply some
backup of stocks in the hands of manufacturers and retailers. The
general economic situation, including capacity utilization rates and

I- 3
profits, seems conducive to prospective declines in business fixed
investment spending. However, gradually easing credit conditions are
still expected to result in further increases in residential construc-
tion activity and larger purchases by State and local governments.
The pattern of economic recovery will be distorted by the
GM strike over this and the next two quarters. Growth in real GNP
will be considerably dampened this quarter, but the makeup of strike
losses is expected to raise the rate of expansion in real GNP to near
4 per cent in the first quarter of next year. In the second quarter of
1971, auto sales are expected to decline from the post-strike peak level
and real GNP growth to fall back to a rate of about 3 per cent.
On balance, the increase in real GNP from second quarter 1970
to second quarter 1971 may turn out to be smaller than projected.
This suggests the possibility of more slack in resource use than had
been anticipated, with the unemployment rate now projected at 5.9 per
cent in the spring of 1971 and the capacity utilization rate in
manufacturing dropping to about 75 per cent. Slower growth and more
unused resources lend support to the projected slowing of the increase
in the GNP deflator to a 3.0 per cent annual rate next spring.
Financial
Interest rates have declined on balance since the last meeting
of the Committee, partly in response to a further easing of money market
conditions. Early in the inter-meeting period, a sharp drop in the
Federal funds and 3-month Treasury bill rates below the discount rate

I-4
created widespread expectations of an imminent cut in the discount rate
as well. But when Federal funds then traded above 6 per cent again,
these expectations disappeared, and the bill rate also moves slightly
above 6 per cent.
In capital markets, the downward drift of interest rates was
inhibited by a significant further build-up in the calendar of new
bond offerings, both municipals and corporates. Investor reception of
the expanded new issue flow has been generally favorable, however,
and yields have advanced only on longer-term municipal issues--in which
bank interest has remained limited.
In contrast to the heavy volume of long-term corporate
financing, business borrowing at banks weakened abruptly in September--
especially after the tax date--apparently due in part to expanded loan
repayments. With loan demands weak and deposits at banks continuing to
grow rapidly, the prime rate cut initiated at mid-September was
quickly adopted by all major banks.
Deposit expansion in September was centered wholly in time
and savings deposits. Growth of consumer-type accounts accelerated to
about a 15 per cent annual rate, and although bidding for large
negotiable CD's was less aggressive, outstandings still grew by nearly
as much as in August. Since the bulk of this deposit growth was used
to repay bank-related commercial paper and Euro-dollar borrowing, and
demand deposits actually contracted slightly, total bank credit adjusted
for non-deposits sources grew less than half as fast in September as in
August.

I-5
With market interest rates declining, the personal saving
rate high, and consumers concerned about the safety and liquidity of
their financial assets, nonbank thrift institutions also maintained
their much improved inflow of savings funds during September. Moreover,
in the early days of the September-October reinvestment period (the
latest for which data are available), net savings losses at these
institutions were quite modest.
Securities market outlook. The pattern of recent large
additions to the forward calendar of corporate and municipal security
offerings suggests that the weight of such financing will remain very
large through the fourth quarter. In the corporate market, this
sustained large volume apparently reflects continued emphasis on such
considerations as funding shorter term liabilities, rebuilding liquid
assets, improving debt-equity ratios, and leaving bank lines open for
future use. In addition, of course, the relationship between invest-
ment expenditures and internal generation of funds implies continuing
needs for a large volume of external financing. In the tax exempt
market, the enlarged calendar continues to be heavily weighted with
issues previously postponed because of high interest rates.
In the Federal sector, plans for refinancing large November
debt maturities are expected to be announced on October 22--probably
in the form of a rights-cash operation. The Treasury has just raised
$2.5 billion of new money through a tax bill. But additional cash
borrowing of about $2.5 billion is likely to be needed before year-end,

I- 6
not counting the $1.7 billion already scheduled to be raised through
further additions to weekly and monthly bill auctions.
A bunching of corporate and municipal bond offerings is now
scheduled to occur at about the same time the Treasury will be engaged
in its November refinancing. Some temporary increases in note and
bond yields could, therefore, develop at that time. But over the
quarter as a whole, the combination of sluggish economic growth and a
moderate continuing expansion of money and bank credit seems likely
to encourage some further down drift of interest rates. If expecta-
tions of a cut in the discount rate were revived, the decline would
accelerate, particularly among short-term rates.
Banking outlook. With market rates expected to drift lower,
the ability of banks to attract a large volume of both CD's and consumer-
type deposits should improve. In fact, if market rates drop off very
much, CD rate ceilings would cease to be a restraint on the choice of
CD maturities. Banks will probably continue the process of rebuilding
liquidity positions and repaying alternative high cost funds, although
perhaps bidding less aggressively for CD's as time goes on. Overall
bank credit growth is, therefore, likely to be dampened by further
reductions in commercial paper and Euro-dollar borrowings. With
business loan demands expected to be sluggish--in view of heavy capital
market borrowings and the projection of only limited economic growth--
banks should be in a position favorable to the acquisition of municipal
securities, Treasury issues, and mortgages. In this environment, banks

I-7
would probably also relax business loan policies and might become
more willing to extend term loans.
Mortgage markets. Outstanding mortgage commitments have
grown further under the stimulus of the good third-quarter savings
performance at nonbank thrift institutions, and there are field reports
of greater mortgage availability. We would expect this trend to
continue, although some temporary moderation of the forward momentum
could develop if S&L's and savings banks become concerned about
deposit losses associated with the possible issuance of a savings
bond-type instrument by AT&T.
Balance of payments
The latest data on merchandise imports, for August, were
disappointingly high--virtually at the May peak level again. With
exports off somewhat, the trade balance was only half as large as it
had been in June and again in July. However, a change in this direction
was not unexpected, in view of the erratic character of the series,
and (at least until September data become available) our views of the
trade outlook have not changed substantially.
Imports are expected to be lower again in September and then
to rise gradually in coming months, reflecting both strengthening domes-
tic demand and easing of the supply position for various materials
abroad. Exports are still expected to rise in the fourth quarter and
on into next year. Taking account also of service transactions and

I- 8
investment income, net exports of goods and services are expected to
increase somewhat beyond the $4-1/2 billion annual rate that was
achieved in the second quarter. This compares with about $2 billion
in the year 1969.
The improvement in net exports between 1969 and 1970 should
carry through to the overall balance on the liquidity basis (adjusted).
But since net capital outflows, even without counting changes in
liabilities to commercial banks abroad, may be nearly as adverse this
year as in 1969, the deficit will remain large. Through the first
three quarters it has cumulated to about $4-1/2 billion. There is a
possibility of very large and partly reversible repartriations of U.S.
corporate investment funds at the end of the year--larger than would
be counted as seasonal--and, if this occurs, there might be a surplus
in the fourth quarter, cutting the year's liquidity deficit (adjusted)
below $4 billion. This would compare with about $6-1/2 billion for the
year 1969. Last year's deficit was enlarged by a considerable outflow,
partly identified but largely unidentified, of private (nonbank) liquid
funds from the United States, and thus far in 1970 there have again
been some net outflows of such kinds.
The official settlements deficit cumulated through the
first three quarters of 1970 now exceeds $7 billion (before counting
the SDR allocation). This deficit has been covered to the extent of
$2.4 billion by a net reduction in U.S. reserve assets. Official

I- 9
holdings of convertible currencies are down by $1.7 billion, and the
U.S. reserve position in the IMF has contracted by $0.4 billion. Gold
holdings have been reduced by $0.4 billion, while SDR holdings have
increased (apart from the initial allocation) by $0.1 billion. The
remainder of the financing, amounting to about $5 billion, has taken
the form of additions to foreign reserve claims against the United
States, with very large net acquisitions by Germany (over $4 billion)
and Canada (over $1 billion).
Prospects for the remainder of the year depend greatly on
whether or not U.S. banks continue to maintain their Euro-dollar
borrowings despite the interest rate incentives that push them toward
making repayments. Euro-dollar interest rates, influenced by continued
tightness in European financial markets, have lagged behind the decline
in U.S. market rates. In recent months moderate declines have occurred
in short-term rates in some European countries, but long-term yields
have remained very high and the policies of governments and central banks
are still directed predominantly at resisting inflation. Some signs of
easing in the expansion of aggregate demand are now evident in several
countries, but these have not been sufficient to bring major changes in
monetary policy.

Gross national product. Recent data suggest that underlying
economic forces may be somewhat weaker than had been anticipated earlier.
The unemployment rate rose sharply in September. Nonfarm employment
figures for July and August have been revised down, substantially so
for August, and manhours in manufacturing dropped significantly fur-
ther in September. Consumer spending has continued sluggish, and the
personal saving rate remained at a high level in the third quarter.
Inventory accumulation, according to data for July and August, has
been taking place at a more rapid pace than expected, and in part may
have been involuntary.
These indications of weakness pre-date the GM strike which
curtailed auto production and aggregate output in the last half of
September. The impact of the auto strike on total third quarter GNP
was relatively mild, however, with total product estimated to be down
by only $2 billion, annual rate, on this account. If, as we are assum-
ing, the strike lasts until the end of October, it will have a larger
dampening effect on fourth quarter GNP even though production schedules
for November and December will be stepped-up. However, we expect that
a considerable portion of the strike loss will be made up in early 1971,
The third quarter GNP increase amounted to $14 billion, annual
rate. This was about the same as in our previous projection, but the
composition differs in some respects. Consumer spending rose only
$8 billion, rather than the $10-1/2 projected in the previous Green-
book. Unit sales of new domestic autos remained at the second quarter

annual rate of 8.0 million, but dropped to 7.2 million in September.
(Our previous projection assumed such sales at an 8.5 million rate.)
Sales of other durable goods were apparently off a little in the quar-
ter. Spending on nondurable goods rose moderately. The somewhat
larger-than-expected rise in inventory investment seems to be associ-
ated in part with the lack of ebullience in consumer spending.
Changes in the other major GNP components from our pre-
vious third-quarter projection were on balance upward. These in-
clude a small rise in business fixed investment rather than a decline,
a larger-than-anticipated rise in State and local government purchases,
and a smaller rise in residential construction outlays. Altogether,
in real terms, GNP rose at an annual rate of 1.4 per cent, compared
with 0.6 per cent in the second quarter. The implicit price de-
flator is estimated to have increased at an annual rate of 4.4 per
cent, little different from the second quarter rise.

The continued cautious spending attitudes of consumers along
with the assumption that supplies of G. M. autos will be limited hold
GNP growth to $12.5 billion, annual rate in the fourth quarter as com-
pared with $15 billion projected previously. Even if GM resumes pro-
duction at high rates at the beginning of November, all of the strike
loss is not likely to be made up by the end of the quarter, and sales
of autos and trucks as well as dealer stocks are likely to be lower__

than otherwise. The loss of income by workers on strike will also re-
sult in some secondary effects on production, employment, and income.
We therefore expect that the increase in consumption expendtiure will
be a little smaller than previously projected.
Inventory investment is expected to be lower than in the
third quarter, mainly because of the auto situation. Other major com-
ponents of GNP change are about the same as projected earlier. The
anticipated small decline in business fixed investment appears consistent
with the moderately lower level of new orders for machinery and equipment
and the downward trend in physical output of business equipment. On
balance, we anticipate some lessening of price pressures. And we pro-
ject real GNP to grow at an annual rate of about 1.5 per cent.

The assumed catch-up early next year from the GM strike
accounts for the projected large first quarter increase of $20.5 billion
in GNP. Purchases of consumer durables are projected to rise about
$4.5 billion, annual rate, as the result of an increase in domestic auto
sales to about a 9 million annual rate. Inventory investment is pro-
jected at a slightly lower level than in the previous Greenbook, as the
strike-deferred build-up at GM dealers is limited by a high sales rate.
On the other hand, accumulation of steel as a hedge against a possible
strike is likely.
In the second quarter of next year, GNP is expected to
increase by only $15 billion, as consumption drops back from its high
first quarter rate of gain. However, inventory investment is likely to
be larger than in the first quarter, reflecting a further build-up of
auto stocks and some further precautionary buying of steel. Residential
construction activity and State and local governments should continue
to provide strength to the economy, assuming a moderate monetary expan-
sion and an associated gradual easing in overall credit conditions. The
GNP deflator is expected to slow to about a 3 per cent annual rate of
increase and we are projecting real GNP growth in the second quarter at
about a 3 per cent rate.
Real GNP is projected to increase 2.4 per cent from the second
quarter of 1970 to the second quarter of 1971, compared with 2.7 per
cent in our previous projection. This is well below the prospective
growth rate of the nation's productive resources. This prospect along
with the high September unemployment rate have led us to raise our pro-
jected unemployment rate, with a 5.9 per cent rate now judged likely in
the second quarter of 1971.

Industrial production. Industrial production in September
was 166.0 per cent, down 1.7 per cent from August and 4.5 per cent from
a year earlier. The decline in the total index since the July 1969 high
is 4.9 per cent. The September decline of 2.9 index points reflects an
estimated loss of -1.9 points because of the direct effects of the G.M.
strike on the auto and supplying industries, and a loss of another
point because of widespread declines in utput of consumer goods other
than autos, business and defense equipment, and materials.

Auto assemblies declined 34 per cent in September to an annual

In 1964, the strike began September 25; a national agreement
was reached on October 25, but full production was not attained until
mid-November. In 1970, the strike began September 15 and, in the above
table, it is assumed that the strike continues through October.
Among other consumer goods, output of furniture continued to
decline in September and production of some appliances and apparel were
curtailed. Production cutbacks in business equipment industries were
widespread and since the Sept.-Oct. 1969 peak, output has declined 10
per cent.
Among materials, production of steel changed little in September,
but trade reports indicate some curtailments in October. Output of most
other durable materials was reduced, as well as nondurable materials
such as textiles, paper, and rubber products. Production of chemicals
changed little but crude oil production rose further.

In addition to a September decline of 1.3 per cent in
production worker manhours, the August data have been revised sharply
downward. In August both employment and average hours work declined,
but in September the decline was concentrated in the workweek. Since
the BLS reporting week included the Labor Day holiday, about a dozen
series, for which the August to September appear overstated, have been
modified for inclusion in the index.
Retail sales. Retail sales in September were virtually
unchanged from August with a .2 per cent increase, according to the
advance partial-sample estimate. Sales of durable goods rose .4 per
cent, as the automotive group reported an increase of close to 1 per
cent (despite the decline in unit sales of domestic autos to an annual
rate of 7.2 million from 8.4 million in August); sales of the building
materials group advanced 5.9 per cent. Sales of nondurables were
unchanged (up .1 per cent); sales at general merchandise (and department)
stores were up about .7 per cent and sales at apparel stores were down
nearly 2 per cent.
Sales in the third quarter were only .7 per cent above the
second, the smallest quarterly change since the third quarter of 1969.
Durable goods sales increased 1.3 per cent; both the automotive and
building materials groups were up but sales of furniture and appliance
stores declined (2.8 per cent). Sales at nondurable goods stores were
.4 per cent higher for the quarter with most major categories virtually
unchanged.

The UAW strike by limiting dealers' stocks of cars which
usually account for over half of total domestic auto sales will cause
some consumers to delay--or forego until the next model year--auto
purchases. As can be seen in the following table, sales generally
drop in a strike affected period and then recover subsequently to a
rate above pre-strike experience. The strike in 1964 is closest to
the present strike in the large number of manhours lost. Compared with
other strike periods, dealers' stocks going into the strike were relatively
high but GM production in the 1971 model year, even before the strike,
was lagging relative to other makes. As a result, the customer wedded
to a GM purchase is likely to be disappointed in his choice of model,
at least until late in the fourth quarter.

Consumer credit. Consumer instalment credit outstanding
increased at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of only $2.8 billion
in August, compared with a $5.3 billion rise in July and a first
half average of $4.3 billion. In the first half of 1969 the rate of
expansion was $9.0 billion. Nonautomotive consumer goods credit out-
standing and personal loans rose moderately in August but auto credit
showed the largest decline for any month since April 1961.
There have been some sizable shifts recently in the pattern
of change in consumer instalment credit by holder. Many of the large
independent sales finance companies have indicated their intention to
curtail both dealer and consumer financing of new and used cars. Even
after allowance for substantial sales of paper to commercial banks,
there has been a reduction in consumer auto lending by sales finance
companies that has not been offset by gains in other areas of finance
company lending operations.

Inventories. The book value of business inventories rose
at a $7.6 billion annual rate in August, substantially less than the
July rate of $15.1 billion. However, the average rate of book value
growth at manufacturing and trade establishments in the first two
months of the third quarter was more than double the second-quarter
average rate.
Close to half of the July-August increase in accumulation
took place at automotive retailers; this probably was in anticipation
of the strike, and may be reversed in September and October. Elsewhere,
there is some evidence of involuntary accumulation. Stocks of home
goods and apparel manufacturers rose at a $1.6 billion rate in the
face of declining orders and shipments. GAAF stores, which had changed
their inventories little in the second quarter, added to them at a $1.2
billion annual rate in July and August, more than proportionately
to sales.

No general increase in inventory imbalance was evident in
the overall manufacturing and trade inventory-sales ratio, although
it remained at a high level; the biggest increase in component ratios
in August was a result of the auto pre-strike buildup. However, the
ratio of inventories to unfilled orders at durable goods manufacturers,
already at an all-time high in July, continued to climb in August as
order backlogs were worked down.

the 1968 and 1969 Annual Retail Trade Survey has lowered current
levels of inventories and inventory-sales ratios. Back data were
not available in time to calculate earlier ratios for comparison
or to evaluate the effects of this revision on past patterns,
Manufacturers' new orders. New orders received by producers
of durable goods dropped 2.7 per cent in August, after a July increase
of 4.6 per cent. The July-August average is 5.1 per cent above the
second quarter, mainly as a result of increasesin orders for defense
products and autos, with smaller increases for construction materials
and some other industry groups.
Defense orders were a major factor in both the July increase
and the August decline in durable goods orders. The July-August average

II -15
of defense orders is sharply above the low second quarter average;
even on a six-month average basis, which minimizes the effects of
this series' highly erratic movements, defense hardware orders averaged
2.5 per cent above year-earlier levels.
Orders for capital equipment have declined moderately this
year. The July-August average, about unchanged from the second quarter,
was 6.5 per cent below the peak in the fourth quarter of last year.

Cyclical indicators. The preliminary leading indicator
composite declined slightly in August, to a level 1.4 per cent above
its May low, after two months of increase. The coincident composite
also declined slightly, after two months of slight increase, and the
lagging composite rose 1 per cent, coming close to its December peak.

The August decline in the leading composite resulted from
declines in materials prices, the manufacturing workweek, new orders
for durable goods, contracts and orders for plant and equipment, and
the ratio of price to unit labor cost, and from an increase in initial
claims for unemployment insurance. Although six out of the eight
series were down, the declines were moderate in amount. Housing permits

II -17
and common stock prices increased, and as it does each month, the
trend adjustment provided a +.3 effect. Since the composites were
calculated, August declines have been reported in two more of the
component series -inventory change and change in consumer install-
ment debt.
In September, a further downward effect on the leading
indicators will be felt from declines in industrial materials prices
and the manufacturing workweek and an increase in initial claims for
unemployment insurance. Common stock prices, however, rose in September.
Construction and real estate. Total value of new construction
put in place rose further in September. The increase, which was
associated with an upward revision of about 2 per cent for August, was to
a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $92.7 billion. While this was 2
per cent above a year earlier in current dollar terms, in real terms,
as measured by the Census Bureau, it was 5 per cent below.
Within the private sector, residential construction outlays
in current dollars advanced further in September, but were about 8
per cent under the peak in April 1969. Outlays for nonresidential
construction apparently also rose and were within 3 per cent of the
high reached last March. Outlays for public construction changed
little in September. Although expenditures for State and local
projects were revised upward appreciably for July and August, the level
in September was 4 per cent short of the high achieved in February
of 1969.

Seasonally adjusted private housing starts turned down in
August but still left the July-August average somewhat above a 1.5
million unit rate. The August decline was concentrated entirely in
multifamily units, which had been exceptionally high in July. In
view of the rise in building permits in August and other factors, total
starts in September may have increased at least enough to yield a 1.5
million unit average for the third quarter as a whole. Such an average
would be a fifth above the first quarter 1970 low and the highest rate
since the second quarter of 1969.

2/ Apart from starts, mobile home shipments for domestic use in
August were at seasonally adjusted annual rate of 407 thousand, down
6 per cent from July, though virtually as high as in August 1969.
A conspicuous feature of developments this year has been
the increased importance of Government-underwritten starts in the
total. This shift has been related to a number of factors, including
rapid growth in some of the new subsidy programs developed earlier
for low-income groups, the advanced level of FNMA support to the
market and, especially, the comparatively more attractive yields
available to lenders on home mortgages at a time when usury ceiling
limits on conventional mortgage rates still remain particularly
restrictive in a number of States. Altogether, Government-underwritten__
l .mn ml

II -20
starts have accounted for more than a third of total starts in most
recent months. This compares with only one-fifth in all of 1969 and
with even smaller proportions in virtually every other year of the
previous decade.
Partly reflecting this development, the increased
concentration in the lower-cost categories of new-home sales by
merchant builders has also been marked. While the number of new
homes sold rose in August to the highest rate in more than four years,
the median price at which they were sold held at a level of $23,800--
more than $1,000 under comparable prices a year earlier and more than
$3,000 under the median prices of units still being held by builders
for sale. Evidence of a similar shift in composition of demand in
the existing home market has not been so sharp, with median prices
in August running $23,500 or about 4 per cent higher than a year
earlier, according to the National Association of Real Estate Boards.
Even so, until July, the year-to-year rise in prices of existing
homes sold during 1970 had consistently averaged in excess of 5 per cent.
Labor market. The labor market has shown marked further
easing over the summer and more slack appears in prospect in the
months ahead. In September, the unemployment rate rose to 5.5 per
cent, while average hours of work in manufacturing declined sharply
further. The preliminary estimates showed no change in payroll
employment in September, but the estimates for July and August were
revised down substantially; this is usually a sign of weakness. (These

II -21
data relate to a period prior to the beginning of the General Motors
strike.) The size of the September changes may have reflected
inadequate seasonal factors and an unusually early survey week, but
the direction of change in recent months cannot be in doubt. More-
over, layoffs, as reflected in claims for unemployment compensation,
have increased further since mid-September--partly because of
secondary strike effects--suggesting that the unemployment rate may
rise again in October.
The growing slack has been most clearly reflected in a
wider diffusion of employment declines this past summer. In the
third quarter, nonfarm payroll employment dropped by 436,000, compared
with an increase of 318,000 in the same quarter last year. The third
quarter declines totaling 75,000 in service-type industries--trade,
finance and services-- is particularly noteworthy, indicating both
the widening impact of easing demand and the disappareance of significant
employment growth in other sectors to offset the continuing erosion
in manufacturing jobs. Within manufacturing, moreover, there have
been sizable and persistent reductions in nonproduction worker
employment.

The manufacturing workweek fell .4 hour to 39.4 hours in
September. Part of the drop was probably due to the occurrence of
the Labor Day holiday during the reference week, but the further
downdrift of hours in recent months and the widespread nature of the
September declines also attest to the underlying weakness.
Unemployment and labor force. After showing no growth for
five months, the labor force increased in September while total
employment showed little change. As a result, the overall unemploy-
ment rate rose sharply to 5.5 per cent from 5.1 per cent in August.
The bulk of the rise in joblessness occurred among those 16 to 24
years of age. The very large increases in the unemployment rates of

II -23
various important labor force groups compared to a year earlier are
indicative of the pronounced deterioration of labor demand in 1970.

Erratic labor force changes may have partly obscured the
underlying upward trend of unemployment this summer. Between March
and August, the civilian labor force showed little change, despite
a rise in the population of working age and a cut of 200,000 in the
Armed Forces. Slow labor force growth is generally expected during
periods of economic contraction, but the recent complete halt in
growth was unusual and the September labor force increase may presage
some catch-up.

II -24
Labor force participation rates for most groups showed
larger declines or much smaller increases in the past year than in
the year before, with the changes probably due mainly to easing
demand. Among men early retirement probably accounts for some of the
year-to-year drop for older workers, but the declines among men aged
25 to 54 years seem unlikely to continue, since family responsibilities
tend to keep such men in the work force. Any firming of male partici-
pation rates, or step-up of labor force growth for women, would likely
cause unemployment to rise further, unless employment were to grow
more sharply than currently anticipated.

Productivity. With real output rising slightly in the third
quarter and employment and hours dropping significantly, another strong
rise in output per manhour in the private nonfarm economy is indicated.
This will be the second successive large rise after five quarters of
some net downdrift. The resumption of productivity growth reflects
intensified efforts to reduce costs and has resulted in significant
improvement in the unit labor costs picture over the past two quarters.
Industrial relations. The strike at General Motors is now
in its fifth week. About 350,000 UAW members are on strike and
another 35,000 have been laid off at GM plants exempted from the
strike by the UAW. Outside of GM plants, layoffs do not appear to
have spread widely as yet, although data on this aspect of the strike
are fragmentary.
GM and the UAW have resumed their bargaining on economic
issues, for the first time since the strike began September 15. In
the interim, local bargaining activity was stepped up, but relatively
few of the local bargaining units have reached settlements (27 of 155).
The main national econimic issues to be resolved center on wages,
cost-of-living adjustments, and the union proposal that workers with
30 years service be allowed to retire at any age with a minimum monthly
pension of $500. On wages, the company has offered a first year
increase of 38 cents while the union seeks 62 cents an hour. On changes
in the cost-of-living escalator provisions, the union wishes to eliminate
the ceiling on the amount; the company offers a maximum of 28 cents and

II -26
minimum of 16 cents over the life of the contract. On the "30 and out
out" provision, GM has offered $500 a month for retirement from age
58 to age 62, with reduced pensions both for earlier retirement and
after age 62.
Farm machinery contracts with about 95,000 UAW members
expired at the end of September. Contracts were extended at Caterpillar
Tractor, Deere and International Harvester. A strike at Caterpillar
Tractor was avoided when the company agreed to an unlimited cost-of-
living clause in return for an indefinite contract extension. Settle-
ments in this industry are patterned on auto contracts.
Wholesale prices. After declining in August, seasonally-
adjusted wholesale prices rose at an annual rate of 6 per cent from
mid-August to mid-September, almost as fast as in July. As in the
earlier month, a large rise in farm and food prices was the major
cause of the upswing, but industrials rose 3.4 per cent, faster than
had been reported in the advance estimate.

The sharp rise in prices of farm products and foods in
September was caused by increases for corn and related grains in
anticipation of the effects of the corn blight, and also by eggs,
and fruits and vegetables. Egg prices have receded since the pricing
date, which was almost a month ago. Fresh vegetable prices have also
come down.
Fuel price increases accounted for over 50 per cent of the
increase in industrial wholesale prices in September, and for almost
40 per cent in the third quarter as a whole. A shortage of coal and
residual fuel oil, especially low-sulfur varieties of these products,
accounts for the steady upward pressure on prices. Crude petroleum is
in ample supply worldwide but American refineries are adapted to
produce the much more profitable gasoline from the crude rather than
fuel oil, on which no quota exists.
Continued increases in fuel prices can be anticipated as
there is little hope of increasing supplies of coal, fuel oil, or
natural gas by significant amounts in the short-run. Moreover, a
severe winter, transportation tie-ups or wild-cat strikes could
precipitate a crisis. Some utilities which have almost no reserves
of low-sulfur coal, could switch to ordinary coal, but with resultant
high pollution.

Many materials prices are reflecting the decline in industrial
production, but prices of finished industrial goods are continuing to
rise strongly. Among finished goods, substantial increases were
recorded in September for producers' equipment--including non-electrical
and electrical machinery--and transportation equipment, and for apparel
and footwear.
Prices of nonferrous metals declined in September for the
fourth consecutive month. Steel mill products were unchanged in
September but sharp advances were posted for more highly fabricated
metal products such as containers, hardware, heating equipment, and
plumbing fittings. Tinplate prices were raised October 1, according
to advance announcements. On the other hand, companies have made what
is considered a de facto reduction in cold-rolled steel sheet prices
by putting a sub-prime grade on the market. Fuel prices have risen
further since mid-September.

Prices of motor vehicles will increase appreciably in October
and the increase in the fourth quarter may exceed the 11 per cent annual
rate of rise in the comparable period of last year.
The corn blight has worsened the outlook for meat prices in
1971, but the situation is not so gloomy as to justify prophesies
quoted in the Wall Street Journal that meat prices are likely to be
30 to 40 per cent higher by mid-1971. The carryover of grain and the
size of other crops appear sufficient to restrain prices from rising
by such extravagant amounts; however, meat prices are likely to rise,
starting in the first or second quarter of next year--after declining
in the present quarter. A second low corn crop next year would be
more critical, since two years of scarce supplies would result in a
sharp drop in meat animal numbers. Seed companies will not be able
to supply all needs for blight-proof or resistant strains of seed,
prices of which have already risen sharply.

Consumer prices. Consumer prices rose in August at an
annual rate of less than 3 per cent, seasonally adjusted, the smallest
increase since December 1963. This contrasts with a rate of rise of
about 3-1/2 per cent in July and of about 6 per cent over the previous
year and a half.

The relatively moderate August increase reflected a basic
improvement in food supplies, leading to a leveling in food costs, as
well as transient declines in some non-food commodities. Two erratic
items--used cars and gasoline prices--dropped, offsetting an increase
in seasonally adjusted apparel prices and a less than seasonal decline
in new car prices.

II -31
Much of the 3.5 per cent rate of increase in durable goods
prices in August, as well as the 4.6 per cent rise over the last year,
resulted from sharp increases in prices of new and used houses. These
rose .9 per cent at an annual rate in August, and about 8 per cent over
the year. (The table below presents for the first time in the Greenbook
a breakdown of durable goods price changes showing "home purchase"
separately. Estimates of the latter are unofficial and confidential.)
Used car prices declined in August but increased 3 per cent, and new car
prices about 2.5 per cent, over the 12 month period. Much of the
erratic movement in consumer durables prices over the past year has
been attributable to swings in used car prices. (The present series
for used car prices has not been available long enough to permit
seasonal adjustment.)
Among nondurables, apparel prices rose in August after
declining in July. The large group of "other nondurables," which
has been rising at an accelerated rate in recent months, failed to
advance in August as gasoline price reductions offset continued
increases for cigarettes and alcoholic beverages.

Services less home finance rose somewhat less rapidly in
August than in earlier months of the year. In the fourth quarter a
one-time downward adjustment will be made in the level of medical care
costs to compensate for over-estimates of the increase over the past
year. A similar adjustment had a marked effect in slowing the rise in
the CIP last October.
Present estimates indicate that retail food prices rose on
a seasonally adjusted basis in September. Food prices may be fairly
stable in the present quarter with meat, especially pork, lower in

October 1 crop outlook. The survey of crop conditions on
October 1 was reassuring in that it showed no additional deterioration
in the corn blight situation since the special survey of September 23.
The crop is forecast at 4,188 million bushels, 5 per cent and 13 per
cent, respectively, below the September 1 and July 1 forecasts. The
crop is down 9 per cent from 1969 and output of all feed grains is down
8 per cent from 1969, considerably below requirements. Substantial
drafts on old crop stocks of feed grains and wheat will be required to
feed the large numbers of livestock on farms during the coming year.
Total crop output prospects declined slightly during September
with reduced corn and cotton yields offset in part by small gains in
soybeans, tobacco and sugar crops. Pasture conditions improved.
Compared with 1969, crop output is down 2 per cent. Cuts in
wheat and rice were planned to adjust supplies with demand prospects.
Disappointing yields cut down the feed grain, cotton, hay and flaxseed
crops and all of the noncitrus fruits except apples and plums. Among
the crops equaling or exceeding last year's output were soybeans,
peanuts, tobacco, and vegatables. Plentiful supplies of citrus fruits,
potatoes and fall vegetables are in prospect.

THE ECONOMIC PICTURE IN DETAIL
Domestic Financial Situation
Monetary aggregates. The money supply declined slightly in
September, as private demand deposits edged downward while currency
holdings increased at a modest pace for the second month in a row. The
September decline offset part of the August bulge in money balances and
growth for the third quarter was held to a seasonally adjusted annual
rate of 4.5 per cent (using published data), up only slightly from the
rate of advance in the second quarter.

U.S. territories and possessions; and liabilities to banks' own
foreign branches.

Time deposits increased at nearly a 30 per cent annual rate
in September, about the same as in August but somewhat slower than in
July. Sales of large CD's were again quite strong, increasing on a
seasonally unadjusted basis at large commercial banks by slightly more
than $2 billion. The great bulk of the September sales was concentrated
in the less than 90-day maturity range as in other recent months, but
sales also picked up significantly in all other principal maturity
ranges, as CD's became more attractive to investors with the drop in
rates on other money market instruments.
Consumer-type time and savings deposits also rose sharply in
September. On a seasonally unadjusted basis flows into passbook savings
accounts and other time accounts at large commercial banks substantially
exceeded the inflows in July, when growth was quite favorable. Country
member banks also recorded a pick-up in time and savings deposit inflows
in September, but the incoming volume of funds failed to match the very
strong July increase at these banks.

The adjusted credit proxy (member bank deposits adjusted for
nondeposit sources of funds) advanced at a much slower seasonally
adjusted annual rate in September than in August. In part, this
reflected the down drift in demand deposits. In addition, however,
U.S. Treasury deposits dropped slightly and, more importantly, banks
cut back sharply on their use of nondeposit sources of funds. Out-
standing commercial paper of affiliates declined steadily throughout
the month and in the last week of the month averaged about $2.7 billion
less than in the last week in August (and about $3.1 billion below the
average established in the week prior to the mid-August change in
reserve requirements). Bank borrowings from foreign branches was also
subject to steady attrition which cumulated to nearly $.6 billion for
the month. Modest further reductions also took place in borrowings
from other foreign lenders and in the volume of loan RP's outstanding.
Bank credit. Commercial bank credit adjusted for loan sales
to affiliates is estimated to have increased at a 7.1 per cent season-
ally adjusted annual rate from the last Wednesday in August to the last
Wednesday in September. This is down substantially from the rapid pace
in July and August. Holdings of U.S. Treasury securities continued to
rise, but at a decidedly slower rate than in July and August, and loan
growth was also much weaker. Total loans, after adjustment for loan
sales increased at only a 2.1 per cent seasonally adjusted annual rate.
In contrast, bank investment in "other securities" (mainly municipal
and Federal agency issues) advanced markedly further in September. Banks

III -4
appear to have channelled a somewhat larger portion of their investible
funds into longer dated municipals, but acquisitions for the most part
remained heavily concentrated in short-term and intermediate-term issues.

A sharp drop in business loans (adjusted for loan sales) was
mainly responsible for September's weak loan picture. Loans to nonbank
financial institutions also edged off further during the month, however,
while the modest uptrend in consumer and real estate loans continued.
In contrast, a comparatively sharp gain was recorded in loans to secur-
ities brokers and dealers for the third month in a row.
The decline in business loans followed a comparatively sharp
rise in August. For the two months combined such loans remained essen-
tially unchanged, a considerably weaker showing than the generally
moderate growth recorded earlier in the year. Conversations with bankers

III -5
suggest that reduced loan demands are mainly responsible for the recent
weak loan growth. Because banks have been reacquiring loans previously
sold in substantial volume, data reflecting business loans by industry
do not provide an accurate picture of recent developments and thus it
is not possible to trace the recent weakening to specific industry
sectors. It seems likely, however, that at least part of the subsidence
in loan growth can be attributed to the strike in the auto industry.
Nonbank depositary institutions. Data now available indicate
that deposit outflows were quite modest from the thrift institutions
during the early part of the September-October reinvestment period.
Lower short-term market yields, perhaps consumer uncertainty with respect
to the employment outlook, and the reduced growth in consumption spend-
ing have served to support flows into the savings and loan associations
and--to a lesser extent--the mutual savings banks.

These factors are also manifested in the sharply improved

at S&Ls. Estimates for September deposit flows, which are based upon
usually reliable sample data, suggest that total nonbank deposit growth
during the third quarter was the highest for any quarter since the com-
parable period in 1967.

2/ Preliminary. September data are estimated on the basis of a sample.
Savings and loan associations, with their liquidity largely
restored and their deposit growth strong, borrowed only a modest amount
from the FHLB during September, continuing the trend of the past several
months. The liquidity of the FHLBanks stood at $1.5 billion at the end
of September, down about $300 million during the month in reflection of
the FHLBanks' payment for mortgage purchases contracted previously for
its GNMA-backed mortgage pool. These funds will be replenished when
the GNMA security is issued by the FHLB, now tentatively scheduled in
November. Reflecting a downward revision, the FHLB now plans to borrow
a modest amount of new money during the fourth quarter, and to repay
some of its maturing debt during the first quarter of 1971 to reduce
its liquidity to about $1 billion.
Mortgage market. With savings flows to the thrift institu-
tions holding up in September and early October, trade opinion and field

III -8
reports both suggest a continuation of the gradual recovery underway
in the pace of new residential mortgage commitments. Mortgage terms
may also have eased somewhat. However, most data series for the period
are not yet available.
Although savings flows to nonbank thrift institutions had
slackened during August, the backlog of outstanding mortgage commitments
at savings and loan associations increased for the fifth consecutive
month, on a seasonally adjusted basis. This increase at S&Ls more than
offset a further decline in outstanding mortgage commitments at New York
State mutual savings banks, where a downtrend has continued throughout
the year as savings flows have recovered less than for the industry as
a whole whereas liquidity has been built up more. By the end of August,
the mortgage commitment backlog at both S&Ls at savings banks combined
reached the highest level in 10 months.
An improvement in residential mortgage market conditions
during September and early October was implied by a modest reduction
in yields on Government underwritten mortgages in FNMA's bi-weekly
auction. By the October 6 auction, yields on 6-month forward commit-
ments had declined to 8.92 per cent. This was more than 40 basis points
below the high posted earlier in the year, and was the lowest since
December 1969. Although continuing in a relatively modest volume that
implied increased private availability of mortgage funds, offers to FNMA
in the most recent auction picked up as some sellers attempted to replace
older, lower-priced commitments with higher-priced ones.

Yields shown are gross, before deduction of fee paid by investors to
servicers of 50 basis points prior to August 10 auction, and 38 basis
points thereafter. At lease partially offsetting the effect of the
reduction in servicing fees on bid prices and gross yields in the
August 10 and following auctions was another FNMA regulatory change
permitting mortgage servicers to retain all escrow funds received on
mortgage serviced under the reduced fee schedule. Under earlier
practice, FNMA had retained most of these funds itself.
Indications are that the cut in the prime rate in late
September has been followed by a reduction in costs of short-term
credit to finance construction as well as in costs of interim credit
to carry mortgages being warehoused. Although the staff feels it to
be unlikely, trade expectations have persisted that ceiling rates on
FHA-insured and VA-guaranteed mortgages, now 8-1/2 per cent, will be
lowered before the November elections. These expectations have caused

III -10
a number of mortgage companies to warehouse Government underwritten
mortgages while awaiting more favorable prices anticipated for such
loans.
Life insurance companies. Although increases in policy loans
outstanding appear to have passed their peak, such loans nevertheless
remain a significant drain on life insurance funds available for invest-
ment. Life insurance loanable funds have shown virtually no growth in
the past three years, and companies' projections of funds available for

the third quarter continued in that pattern. Indeed, as shown in the
last line of the table, funds available for the bond and mortgage
markets have actually decreased as separate account business--invested
predominantly in common stocks--has begun to grow rather rapidly.
Policy loan increases are only one of the factors serving to keep down
the industry's gross cash flow into market instruments; other factors
include the absence of growth in return flows from mortgages and

III -11
securities despite the substantial growth in those portfolios over the
period, and the lack of growth in funds from premium receipts and income
from investments and operations.

three-fourths of the reduced year-earlier total. Significantly, of
the current total of commitments outstanding, an unusually small share
is scheduled to be disbursed within the next six months. The flexi-
bility that this commitment disbursement scheduling implies is mani-
fested in the low ratio of these scheduled disbursements to cash flow
expected during the same period. Despite industry efforts to maintain
leeway, that ratio had increased in late 1969 and early 1970; but by
the second quarter of 1970, commitments scheduled for near-term dis-
bursement had been worked down to more comfortable proportions with a
cash flow projection that continues to show minimal growth.

Corporate and municipal security markets. Long-term securities
markets absorbed a substantial volume of both corporate and municipal
bonds in September and early October. Although the increase in final
demand for municipal bonds was impressive, the three-month decline in
long-term tax-exempt yields was reversed, with rates rising about 20
basis points during September and then levelling off in early October.
Yields on high-grade corporate bonds, after some backup in mid-September,
stabilized in early October at about the same level as a month earlier.
In the equity markets, a strong stock price rally begun in late September
failed to persist, and the market averages closed on October 9 essen-
tially unchanged from their month-earlier levels. Sharply increased
trading activity during the last three weeks of September appears to have
been caused by institutions making adjustments to their end-of-quarter
portfolios in preparation for reports to shareholders.

Although institutional investors showed some resistance to
attempts by underwriters to test the market with aggressive pricing,
particularly on utility bonds, most corporate issues sold out quickly
in September and early October. Aside from the general easing of
financial markets, the large number of high quality industrial bonds
and the judicious mixture of long and intermediate term maturities were
probably important factors in the market's absorption of the large
volume without further rate increases. In the last 6 weeks, over $500
million of bonds, or about one-fifth of total public bond sales, have
had maturities of 7 years or less. Furthermore, almost half of all
public bond issues in the 6-week period was accounted for by very large
issues--$100 million or more. At the same time, however, in the last
few weeks the volume of Baa and lower-rated issues has begun to recover
from the May-June lows, and in recent weeks convertible bond sales and
announcements have picked up, reflecting the improved situation in the
stock market.
The staff now estimates that public bond offerings in October
will be about $2.6 billion, a significant increase from the projection
of $1.9 billion made in the last Greenbook. The October calendar was
boosted by an unusual number of industrial offerings, some of them in
the $150 to $250 million size class. While offerings in the public
market have picked up, private placements of bonds seem to be continuing
at only a moderate pace, as insurance company commitments have remained
below normal for some time. However, new issues of stock in October
are expected to rise sharply, primarily as a result of a number of large

III -15
utility offerings. Indeed, utility use of the equity market has been
a significant factor in stock sales for several months. Sales of stock
by nonutility companies also increased recently as the equity market
improved. In summary, the staff estimates that total corporate security
offerings in October and November will be well above theeexpected yearly
average of $3 billion, with a seasonal decline in December when the
market virtually shuts down in the last two weeks of the year.

1/ The second quarter "Public Offerings" and "Total" figures include
the $1.569 billion AT&T offering. The monthly averages for the
second quarter, excluding AT&T, would be $1,808 for "Public Bond
Offering" and $2,966 for "Total Offerings."
These staff projections for the fourth quarter imply a level
of total security offerings exceeded only by that of the second quarter,
which had been swollen by the massive AT&T issue. Apparently, corporations

III -16
continue to be motivated by the desire to increase their long-term
capital, repay short-term debt, and perhaps increase their holdings of
liquid assets. But, in addition, underwriters report that issuers of
long-term securities--many of whom had been intending to finance earlier
this year--now are obtaining funds to finance current operations.
If staff estimates for the fourth quarter are correct, total
gross corporate security offerings for 1970 will be approximately $37,5
billion, a 40 per cent increase from 1969 and a new record high. Most
of this increase would be accounted for by the surge in public bond
financing. It appears that public debt offerings this year will be
about $24 billion, 60 per cent higher than the previous record for
corporate debt financing, set in 1967.
Sales of long-term bonds by State and local governments
jumped to about $1.7 billion in September. With dealer inventories
relatively heavy and the forward calendar still building, the summer
decline in the Bond Buyer yield index was reversed and in early October
the index stood about 20 basis points above the early September level.
Bank purchases of municipals have been substantial, but they have been
concentrated in issues maturing in under 10 years, and the spread between
rates on short and long maturities has widened appreciably.
The staff estimates that municipal offerings will remain
around the $1.7 to $1.8 billion level in October and November. This
projection assumes that bank participation in the market will be sus-
tained, making possible a level of yields at least no higher than the
present one. New issue volume in December can be expected to show the
usual seasonal decline.

If fourth quarter tax-exempt volume is maintained at levels
expected by the staff, gross municipal long-term debt offerings will
be about $16.7 billion for the year 1970, an increase of about 40 per

Government securities market. Yields on Government securities
are generally 20 to 30 basis points below their levels at the time of
the last Committee meeting. However current rate levels are somewhat
above their lowest levels reached immediately following the meeting when
the market rallied sharply on expectations of a discount rate cut. More
recently as day-to-day money costs have risen from the very low levels
prevailing just after the meeting, these expectations have lessened and
market rates have tended to increase from their lows, particularly in
shorter maturities.

Activity in the Treasury note and bond market has been rela-
tively uneventful in recent weeks, with yields reacting largely to
investors' shifting to and from the corporate market. The fact that
the announcement of the Treasury's November financing operation will be
advanced by a week has produced some activity in the maturing November
issues, and dealers' positions in issues due within a year have increased
accordingly. At the very beginning of the month trading was also
influenced by the fact that many felt that the Treasury would offer a
note at auction in its October cash operation. In the event, however,

III -19
the Treasury opted for an auction of $2.5 billion of June tax anticipa-
tion bills since this would put less strain on savings flows to nonbank
financial institutions.

Demand for Treasury bills has been quite good recently, with
corporate buying particularly strong--perhaps reflecting reinvestment
of some of the proceeds of the heavy volume of corporate bond offerings--
and with some bank portfolio investment as well. Shortly after the last
Committee meeting, the easing in the Federal funds rate to below 6 per
cent resulted in speculation of an imminent discount rate reduction, and

III -20
investment demands for bills were augmented by sizeableprofessional
speculative buying. With the firming of the funds rate toward the end
of September, however, most of this speculation evaporated; and Treasury
bill rates, which in a number of instances had reached new lows for the
year, retraced about half of their earlier declines. With bill demands
holding up and with many having become convinced by the announcement's
delay that the Treasury had in fact decided to postpone experimentation
with a note auction in favor of a tax bill, the Treasury's announcement
of a $2.5 billion tax bill auction for October 15 produced very little
market reaction.
The Federal agency market has been fairly quiet, but on
average the downward movement in yields has been somewhat greater than
on Treasury issues with the result that spreads have narrowed slightly.
There have been only two issues of more than routine note: a $750
million FNMA offering, consisting of a $400 million 26-month and a $350
million 4-year 11-month issue; and a 10-year $200 million (GNMA guaran-
teed) FHLB offering. While the FNMA issues were initially well received
at yields of 7.20 and 7.50 per cent, some investor hesitancy developed
in sales of the longer issue and, despite the general improvement in the
agency market, some price cutting was reported. The FHLB issue, priced
to yield 7.80 per cent and directly competitive with a large volume of
new corporate issues at higher yields, was not particularly well received,
and a number of underwriters reported having difficulty moving the issue.

III -21
Other short-term credit markets. Preliminary commercial
paper data for the month of September show a seasonally adjusted decline
of $1.3 billion. This decline is more than accounted for by the drop
in bank-related paper which fell $2.6 billion over the month. The over-
all decline in bank-related commercial paper since the Board's mid-August
announcement of the new reserve requirement has been $3.1 billion.
Nonbank commercial paper rose $1.3 billion (seasonally
adjusted) in September. During the last week of the month, however,
finance company paper fell $1.1 billion (unadjusted), reducing somewhat
the seasonally adjusted rise for the month in this category of paper.
The drop-off, which is largely seasonal, also reflects a decline in
automobile sales, partly attributable to the General Motors' strike and
the later introduction of new models in much of the industry this year.
Rates on all maturities of commercial and finance company
paper, bankers' acceptances and certificates of deposit have continued
to move down since early September, generally following the overall
decline in the bill rate. The decline in rates on one-month commercial
paper was, however, more than that on Treasury bills, and substantially
greater than those on other short-term paper. By October 7 one-month
commercial paper was being quoted at 6-7/8 per cent and finance paper
at 6-3/4 per cent, the spread between the two having narrowed substan-
tially.
Quotations on commercial paper maturing in three months have
fallen to 7-3/8 per cent and certificates of deposit to 6-7/8 per cent,

III -22
sharper declines than on other short-term instruments in this maturity
range, further eliminating the earlier yield premium on commercial
paper.

Federal finance. The staff estimate of Federal budget
receipts for fiscal 1971 has been lowered further to $197.4 billion in
light of receipts experience and legislative activity since the last
Greenbook. Estimates of tax receipts have been reduced somewhat to
adjust to the smaller growth in personal income that is now projected
by the staff, and to take into account a somewhat smaller inflow of
corporate taxes indicated in September receipts. Since the last Green-
book, the staff also has eliminated revenue effects for the proposed
speed-up of estate and gift taxes for the current fiscal year. Although
chances for enactment of this speed-up seem fairly good, any major
revenue effect would now be postponed until fiscal year 1972. The table
on the next page lists the tax rate changes that the staff expects to
be forthcoming during the remainder of the current fiscal year--most of
them already legislated--as well as tax rate changes that were recommended
by the Administration but are now not included in the staff estimates.
The outlook for budget outlays is still uncertain, as illus-
trated in the second table. The current staff projection of $210.6
billion in budget outlays for fiscal 1971 reflects the House version of
the boost in Social Security benefits, but a Senate Committee provides
a larger increase. On the other hand, House Committee action on defense
appropriations could require a cut of $1.5 billion in spending relative
to the budget rather than the $0.7 billion cut incorporated in staff
estimates. Outlays of the Commodity Credit Corporation are now pro-
jected lower than previously by at least $0.5 billion, mainly reflecting
smaller support purchases because of the corn blight.

3/ Reflects a reduction in negative expenditures.
As a result of the current re-assessment of receipts and
outlays, the staff is now projecting a fiscal year unified-budget
deficit of about $13 billion, and an NIA Federal sector deficit closer
to $14 of $15 billion. The high employment surplus, however, is now
estimated at $1.0 billion. This estimate of the high employment surplus
has been considerably reduced--particularly in the first half of calendar
year 1971--relative to the previous Greenbook, partly because tax
revenues from the speed-up in estate and gift taxes are now being

III -27
excluded and partly because the social insurance programs are now
calculated to result in a higher level of NIA transfers than was allowed
for previously. The current estimate of the high employment budget
surplus for fiscal year 1971, in the amount of $1.0 billion, is precisely
the same as in fiscal year 1970. Quarter by quarter, however, the high
employment surplus moves from a large deficit of around $4 billion at
annual rates in the 2nd and 3rd quarters of calendar 1970 to a small
deficit in the fourth quarter and a surplus of around $3.5 billion dur-
ing the first half of 1971. This is a significantly smaller shift
toward surplus than was expected earlier.
The Treasury cash balance at the end of October is estimated
to be $6.9 billion, after receipt of $2-1/2 billion of payments for
June tax anticipation bills in the latter half of the month. The
Treasury is expected to announce the November refunding on October 22,
and some net new cash may be obtained in this operation if a combined
rights and cash financing is decided on. In total the Treasury is
expected to need another $2-1/2 billion of new financing during the
fourth quarter in addition to the continuing additions to the regular
bill auctions and the October offering of tax anticipation bills mentioned
above. The bulk of the additional cash need will probably be met in a
cash financing at the beginning of December.

THE ECONOMIC PICTURE IN DETAIL
International Developments
U.S. balance of payments. Preliminary data suggest that the
deficits on both conventional measures of the balance increased in
September. On the liquidity basis, however, the September deficit
(seasonally adjusted and before special transactions) was probably
only a little larger than the $450 million in August. On the official
settlement basis the deficit in September'was $1 billion compared to
a small surplus in August.
For the third quarter, the liquidity deficit is estimated
at about $1 billion, compared with $2.1 billion in the second quarter.
No data for specific transactions are available beyond August, but a
major element in the $1 billion reduction in the liquidity deficit
from the preceding quarter appears to have been a sharp reversal in
the flow of U.S. bank credit to foreigners. In the second quarter an
outflow of $450 million occurred, building up bank-reported claims
on foreigners; in July-August there was an outflow of $375 million
(roughly seasonally adjusted). A factor contributing to this reversal
was the policy of the Japanese government to shift the financing of
imports from dollars to yen. Beginning in June the Bank of Japan
provided dollar funds to private Japanese banks that enabled them to
repay U.S. bank credits. In July-August U.S. bank claims on Japan
decreased $150 million, following increases through June.

IV -2
A second factor in the third quarter improvement was renewed
buying of U.S. stocks by foreigners. In July-August foreign net pur-
chases of U.S stocks totaled $160 million; with the further rise in
the stock market in September, there may have been further net purchases.
During the second quarter there had been $130 million of net sales by
foreigners. The improvements in bank claims and sales of U.S. stocks
were offset, in part, by a moderate reduction in sales of securities
abroad by U.S. corporations to finance their investments in foreign
countries, and a substantial increase in U.S. purchases of new foreign
security issues. The latter increased from $100 million in the second
quarter to $500 million in the third quarter. About half of the increase
was in issues of the World Bank. Purchases of issues of Canadian pro-
vincial governments, previously postponed in anticipation of lower U.S.
interest rates, were also greater than in the second quarter.
It appears that only a small part of the improvement in the
liquidity balance in the third quarter stemmed from further improvement
in the trade surplus (discussed below).
On the official settlements basis, the deficit in the third
quarter is estimated at about $2 billion (seasonally adjusted), about
the same as in the second quarter. Liabilities to foreign branches
of U.S. banks were reduced by about $1-3/4 billion in the third quarter,
mainly in July but with some further decline in September. In the second
quarter there had been virtually no net change in liabilities to branches.
By the end of September most banks were very close to their reserve-free
bases on their Euro-dollar borrowings.

U.S. foreign trade. In August, the export surplus declined
to $2.5 billion at a seasonally adjusted annual rate (balance of payments
basis) from the exceptionally high $5 billion rates of June and July.
For the two months of July-August together the surplus was at a $3.8
billion annual rate, compared with rates of $2.1 and $3.4 billion,
respectively, in the first and second quarters. Exports increased only
very slightly in July-August from the second quarter level, while imports
were unchanged.
Exports in July-August were at a seasonally adjusted annual
rate of $43.2 billion, less than 1 per cent above the rate in the second

IV -4
quarter of this year. Agricultural exports exceeded the high second
quarter level in the July-August period by over 3 per cent. Especially
strong showings were made by wheat, corn, and rice, as increases in
exports of these products more than offset declines in exports of cotton,
tobacco, and hides and skins. The rise in exports of wheat in July-
August was largely in response to indications that crops abroad may not
be as good as they were last year. Corn exports increased as a result
of the unusually buoyant foreign demand in July; August exports of corn,
although still fairly high, dropped somewhat from the July level. The
current U.S. corn blight probably did not affect the quantity of corn
exported in August, but it did affect the export unit price which rose
abruptly in that month. The volume of corn exports in the marketing year
beginning in October may be lower than last year but the value will
probably be sustained by higher prices.
Exports of non-agricultural commodities as a whole showed
almost no change in July-August from the second quarter level. Ship-
ments of both electrical and non-electrical machinery made significant
advances because of the continued heavy foreign demand for such equip-
ment. Exports of most other major non-agricultural products, however,
declined during the July-August period. The easing of steel supply
conditions in Western Europe and Japan caused exports of steel-mill
products to fall from the peak levels of the second quarter. Exports
of other industrial materials, such as steel scrap, aluminum, and copper,

IV -5
decreased as well. A very sharp reduction in aircraft exports occurred
mainly because of cancellations and deferments of purchases. Automotive
exports were also lower -- both to Canada and to other areas -- as
earlier-than-usual model changeovers reduced U.S auto production.
Imports in July-August averaged a $39.4 billion seasonally
adjusted annual rate (balance of payments), a rate virtually the same
as that of the second quarter. With few exceptions, the major groups
of commodities were also imported at rates little changed from those
of the second quarter. However, developments in steel, automotive, and
petroleum imports are particularly significant.
Steel imports in July-August were at a rate greater than in
either the second quarter or the entire first half. Tight supply
conditions for steel in Europe have eased somewhat and EEC producers
are now better able to expand their steel exports to the United States,
especially since their 1970 shipments to the United States are thus far
well under voluntary quota levels. During the first eight months of
1970 the value of U S. steel imports were 4.7 per cent greater than in
January-August 1969 but were 6.5 per cent less than during the same
period in 1968.
Automotive imports in July-August declined rather sharply.
This reflected reduced imports from Canada (a relatively early model
changeover cut Canadian production) as well as fewer new car imports
from Europe. European car producers, particularly Volkswagen, are

IV -6
experiencing severe supply shortages resulting from plant shutdowns
(generally due to vacation schedules), labor shortages, and a strong
European demand for new cars. In September Volkswagen sales in the
United States were nearly cut in half. During the past few months
the level of European foreign car sales in the United States has been
maintained by running down inventories. Japanese-made cars, however,
continue to be produced at record levels and their sales in the United
States have increased steadily. For the first eight months of 1970,
European and Japanese made cars accounted for about 14 per cent of
all new cars sold here compared to 12 per cent for the same period
last year.
In the fuels and lubricants group, crude petroleum imports
declined moderately while imports of petroleun products, largely fuel
oils, increased slightly. However, anticipated fuel shortages in the
United States this winter and some increases in oil quotas may result
in a sharp increase in imports of petroleum in the coming months.
Foreign exchange markets. In the period since the last
Green Book, sterling recovered from the speculative attack in early
September, while the Canadian dollar declined sharply. The lira
continued to show strength, and the German mark was generally somewhat
softer.
Sterling has been fairly steady at around 238.60-65 following
the period of speculative selling in early September when the Bank of

IV -7
England sold $435 million in support operations. The discount on
three-month forward sterling fell from around 2 per cent per annum
in the second week in September to about 1¼ per cent at mid-October.
On October 14, the spot rate spurted up to the low 80's following the
release of relatively favorable British trade figures for September.
The Bank of England purchased almost $100 million in themarket in
the last half of September, but sold $80 million in official trans-
actions, as an oil-producing country switched some reserves from
sterling into dollars. To replenish its liquid dollar balances and
to avoid showing in its published reserves the extent of its early
September exchange market losses, the Bank of England on September 30
drew $400 million on the swap facility with the System. Britain's
published reserves for September showed a decline of $86 million.
Thus far in October the Bank of England has made only very small
intervention purchases of dollars.
The German mark eased significantly during the last ten days
of September, as the maturing of forward contracts with the Bundesbank,
totaling nearly $300 million, added to the supply of marks. After
purchasing $525 million spot in the first three weeks of September,
the Bundesbank purchased only $90 million in the succeeding three weeks.
An additional $270 million of Bundesbank forward purchases will mature
during October 9-19, again tending to depress the spot rate for the mark.
The Dutch guilder remained firm near its upper limit during
the last half of September, and the Netherlands Bank purchased $50 million,

IV -8
which it covered through a System drawing on the reciprocal swap
facility. The System's outstanding swap indebtedness to the Netherlands
Bank now stands at $270 million -- the amount of the facility is $300
million.
In early October the Netherlands Bank announced to the market
that it would purchase dollars (sell guilders) on a swap basis from
the banks at terms favorable to the banks. (The purpose of the swaps
is to meet domestic seasonal liquidity demands while avoiding a flow
of uncovered dollars into the central bank's reserves.) During the
first ten days of the month, the Netherlands Bank did $85 million of
such swaps, resulting in some easing of the spot guilder exchange
rate.
The spot rate for the Swiss franc declined steadily in late
September as the Swiss National Bank (BNS) accommodated Swiss banks'
quarter-end liquidity demands, in large part by foreign exchange
transactions. The BNS purchased $425 million in over-month-end swaps,
and an additional $180 million in outright spot transactions. Despite
the reversal of these market swaps in the first week in October, the
domestic market remains very liquid, and the spot exchange rate has
firmed very little. The BNS obtained cover for part of its uncovered
dollar holdings through a System swap drawing on the BNS for $300
million equivalent.
The Italian lira continued its recovery begun in late
August. The Bank of Italy purchased nearly $200 million in September,

IV -9
its largest monthly intervention purchases in over two years, and
thus far in October has purchased an additional $50 million. The
forward discount on three-month lire is currently running at less
than 2 per cent per annum, down from nearly 6 per cent a month ago
and as high as 13 per cent in July.
The Canadian dollar declined sharply from its peak of 99.7
cents on September 17 to a low of 97.6 cents on October 14. The
decline, which began when a Canadian auto company decided that the
exchange rate was too high and sold C$30 million forward, accelerated
the following week when Finance Minister Benson indicated in Copenhagen
that Canada would not re-peg its currency for some time, i.e., until
Canada's current account surplus returned to more normal levels and
the exchange rate to a more defensible rate. The Bank of Canada
sold (U.S.) $105 million from September 17 to September 23. Since
then it has intervened in small amounts on both sides of the market.
Euro-dollar market. Euro-dollar interest rates firmed in
late September, largely reflecting normal quarter-end window dressing
by foreign commercial banks. The three-month deposit rate, which has
been within about 20 basis points on either side of 8-1/8 per cent
since late July (on a weekly average basis) rose to 8-1/2 per cent at
the end of September but declined to average 8.18 per cent in the week
ended October 14.

IV -10
Gross liabilities of U.S. banks to their foreign branches
(including domestic loan participations) changed little on balance
from late July through Wednesday, September 23, averaging about
$10.5 billion. These borrowings declined by about $0.4 billion
in the last week of the third quarter but have since advanced by
about half that amount.
Preliminary data for the New York and Chicago Federal Reserve
Districts indicate that in the reserve computation period ended
September 30, three of the banks using an historical base for
calculation of required reserves against Euro-dollar positions gave
up a total of about $200 million of their reserve-free bases. The
spread between the cost of three-month Euro-dollar funds to U.S. banks
and rates on 60-89 day funds obtained in the domestic CD market
(adjusted for the cost of holding required reserves against the latter)
widened to roughly one percentage point in late September and early
October -- primarily as a result of the marking down of CD offer rates
which declined from about 7-3/8 per cent in early September to about
6-7/8 per cent in early October. (See table.)
Swiss banks repatriated a sizable amount of funds at the
quarter-end (see Foreign Exchange Markets). Outright spot purchases
of dollars at the quarter-end by the BNS increased liquidity in the
Swiss money market and interest rates there reportedly remain low.
The German money market, however, has remained tight throughout

IV -11
the last six weeks or so and rates on three-month inter-bank money
have remained well above 9 per cent. Dutch authorities expect their
domestic money markets to be tight in coming weeks and the Netherlands
Bank has offered swaps to Dutch banks, buying dollars spot and selling
them three-months forward, A more detailed picture of recent develop-
ments in European credit markets is presented in the following section.

Interest rates in major industrial countries. Since last
spring, short-term interest rates have declined in several, but not
all, of the principal industrial countries outside the United States,
and where this has occurred rates are now at or near their lows for
the year. In Canada, short-term rates have come down about 2-1/2
percentage points from their all-time highs of last January. More
moderate declines of between 1/2 and 1 percentage point, measured
from highs established in the first quarter, have been registered in
the United Kingdom, Belgium, France and the Netherlands. In Germany,
short-term rates are below 1970 highs set in July, but have moved up
somewhat since mid-August.
A lessening of demand pressures has provided the basis for
reductions in short-term rates in some countries, particularly in
Canada where the Bank of Canada has acted to reduce the cost of money
concomitantly with the elimination of excess demand from the domestic
economy. Somewhat less buoyant demand conditions have also been part
of the background for rate declines in France and Belgium. However,
the main consideration in France may have been a desire to avoid
unwanted inflows of short-term funds. Different circumstances have
prevailed in Germany, where a tightening of fiscal policy made possible
a cut in official interest rates designed to discourage capital inflows
and thereby, as also in France, to facilitate the control of bank liquidity.
In Britain, where short-term rates have also declined, the central bank

has supported the government bond market during periods of weakening
bond prices, although perhaps in more restrained fashion than in earlier
periods. This has been a factor in an expansion of bank liquidity and
in increases in bank credit and the money stock that were much more rapid
than in the preceding 12 months.
Three important exceptions to the general downward tendency of
short-term interest rates have been Italy, Switzerland, and Japan, where
rates have changed little or, in the case of Italy, have risen further.
There appears to have been no diminution of demand pressures in any of
these countries, and in Italy the balance of payments situation -- while
improved since last winter -- has also called for maintaining tight money.
Declines in bond yields have not been as widespread or as large
as those in short-term rates. Investor expectations that inflation would
continue to be rapid for some time has probably been a major influence
limiting the recovery of bond prices. Bond prices in a given country are
affected not only by such sentiments on the part of domestic investors in
that country but also by the attitudes of investors abroad, notably in the
United States. Since the spring, long-term bond yields have moved to new
highs in Britain, Germany, Switzerland, and Belgium, and have subsequently
declined little or not at all. Declines in Canada and France from highs
early this year have been far smaller than the decreases in short rates.
And in Italy, bond yields have moved sharply higher in recent months.
Accumulating evidence that excess demand in Canada was being
squeezed out of the economy led to further easing in the second and third

IV -16
quarters of monetary policy and of the very tight monetary conditions that
had prevailed at the beginning of 1970. Price indexes show a drop in
wholesale prices since early in the year and a slowing of the rise in
consumer prices to an annual rate of less than 3 per cent in the first
eight months of 1970 (down from over 5 per cent in the same period of
1969). Soon after the turn of the year the Bank of Canada began to allow
Canada's newly-enlarged external surplus to affect domestic monetary condi-
tions, and declines in short-term interest rates in the United States
exerted additional downward pressure on Canadian rates. Canadian Govern-
ment foreign currency accruals became larger in May, when speculation on
a Canadian dollar revaluation intensified; by June 1, when the floating
exchange rate was adopted, the Treasury bill had fallen by 1-1/2 percentage
points. Two reductions of 1/2 percentage point each in the discount rate
on May 12 and June 1 brought that rate closer in line with short-term
market rates.
Even though the move to a floating exchange rate has reduced
Canada's reserve gains, thereby tempering what had been one of the two
main downward influences on Canadian interest rates, the cost of short-
term funds in Canada has continued to drop in response to the lower but
still substantial reserve increases, and declining short-term rates in
the United States after early June. A third 1/2 point discount rate
reduction occurred on September 1 (bringing that rate to 6.5 per cent).
The Canadian Treasury bill yield was 5.27 per cent on October 9, compared

IV -17
with the January high of 7.83 per cent. Since early June, the Canadian
bill yield has averaged some 80 basis points under the U.S. bill yield,
a relationship that is the reverse of the usual.
Bond yields in Canada are still at very high levels about 60
basis points below January peaks, and above 1970 lows touched briefly in
April. The persistence of high yields in the United States has of course
been the principal element limiting the decline in Canadian yields.
In France, the day-to-day money rate has been moving downward
since January, with an interruption in May-June when Euro-dollar rates
also interrupted their decline. Since May 1968 the Bank of France has
kept the day-to-day money rate under very tight control through its open-
market operations, and has adjusted it daily in the light of changes in
rates for Euro-dollar deposits of very short maturity. Rates in the day-
to-day money market are at present some 60 basis points below their April
average. The Bank of France lowered its discount rate from 8 to 7.5 per
cent on August 27, at least partly to obviate or lessen inflows of
short-term funds, which in the view of the French authorities would have
complicated their task of keeping credit expansion within desired bounds.
The Bank of France has experienced large accruals of official reserves
continuously since the mark revaluation a year ago. To prevent excessive
additions to bank liquidity, the central bank raised banks' cash reserve
requirements in June and again in July by 1 percentage point each time;
the requirements are now 7.5 per cent against sight and 2.5 per cent
against time deposits.

IV -18
The discount rate reduction in August was consistent with fresh
evidence that the pace of consumer spending had moderated considerably --
and total spending to a lesser degree -- during the first half of the
year; it followed earlier moves indicative of some relaxation in the
official monetary posture. Ceilings on the expansion of banks' medium-
term loans were raised in April; they were removed, as regards loans for
the purchase of equipment, on July 1, when new ceilings were set for other
types of credit which would allow some acceleration of credit expansion
in the second half. A liberalization of credit terms for the purchase of
most consumer goods, including in particular new and used automobiles,
went into effect on October 6.
Short-term interest rates in Belgium have continued their slow
but steady retreat, the 3-month bill rate being now 90 basis points less
than in January. There has been no change in the National Bank of Belgium's
discount rate this year despite the fact that a change in the bill rate
of this magnitude (and usually less) has usually led to a discount rate
change in the past. Falling short-term rates in Belgium have reflected
Belgium's balance of payments surplus and related reserve gains; the drop
in Euro-dollar rates; and somewhat less vigorous expansion of economic
activity this year than last. In mid-September ceilings on bank credit
expansion were extended through the end of the year but liberalized to
allow a more rapid overall credit expansion (banks being asked not to
increase further their consumer credit and personal loans or loans to

IV -19
financial companies). In contrast, long-term bond yields in Belgium
held at around April levels before moving to new highs in September and
October.
The monetary situation in Germany has been characterized by
continuing efforts on the part of the Bundesbank to contain the expansion
of domestic liquidity. Through May, increases in Bundesbank external
reserves were not large enough to require offsetting measures. From June
onward, however, official reserve increases have been much larger than
earlier this year -- a result of stepped-up net foreign borrowing by
German business firms and, in smaller degree, by German banks -- and have
come at a time when the public sector has been exerting an expansionary
effect on bank liquidity through dradowns of cash balances at the Bundes-
bank. Consequently, in July banks' minimum reserve requirements were
stiffened and their rediscount quotas were lowered slightly. Soon there-
after, effective September 1 banks were subjected to high marginal reserve
requirements, ranging up to 40 per cent, against increases in all deposits
(domestic or foreign) from second-quarter average levels./
The intense demand for funds fueled by the boom in economic
activity caused German bond yields to advance further in the spring and
early sumer, and interbank loan rates to move up in July (after several
months of stability) even as funds flowed in more heavily from abroad.
1/ Total reserve requirements must not exceed the statutory maximum of
30 per cent on demand deposits, 20 per cent on time deposits and 10
per cent on savings deposits.

The Bundesbank cut its discount rate from 7.5 to 7 per cent on July 15.
The purpose of this measure was to facilitate the control of bank liquidity
(and hence of bank credit expansion); by lowering the cost of bank credit
in Germany it was hoped to blunt the incentive for German conpanies to go
abroad for funds and thereby to curtail official reserve acquisitions,
which create bank reserve funds. The discount rate reduction did not and
was not intended to ease German credit conditions. However, the Bundesbank
was unwilling to take this step until fiscal policy had been tightened,
in order to avoid giving the false impression that demand management
policies were being eased. Thus, the discount rate cut followed closely
a government decision to apply a temporary 10 per cent surcharge on personal
and corporation income taxes and to suspend accelerated depreciation
allowances.
The discount rate reduction failed to stem the inflow of funds
from abroad during the succeeding six weeks, a condition which led to the
imposition of the new marginal reserve requirements. Both short- and
long-term market interest rates came down from mid-July to mid-August in
response to the discount rate cut, but since mid-August have reversed part
of those declines. Recent announcements of new bond flotations suggest
that long-term rates, at least, will not decrease again this year.
The discount rate in the United Kingdom has been unchanged
since the two reductions on March 5 and April 15 which together brought
the rate from 8 to 7 per cent. But those short-term interest rates that

IV -21
are not rigidly tied to Bank rate have since undergone declines: rates
for 3-month local authority and hire purchase deposits are each down
more than one-half percentage point from their levels just after the
April Bank rate reduction. Bank liquidity increased in the second and
third quarters when the Bank of England provided heavy support to the
government bond market. A balance of payments surplus was an additional
source of liquidity for the banking system in the second quarter, although
the surplus was much smaller than in any of the preceding three quarters.
Monetary conditions in Britain since March show striking changes
in the rates of expansion of bank credit and the money stock. The money
stock (broadly defined) rose at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of more
than 16 per cent in the second quarter, compared with a 2 per cent rise
over the previous 12 months, the acceleration being largely the consequence
of stepped-up bank lending. In the third quarter the rate of money stock
expansion was probably less than in the second but still several times the
rate of increase in the year up to March. From mid-June to mid-September,
credit expansion by the clearing banks was at a much faster rate than
could be regarded as consistent with Bank of England hortatory guideposts.
Advances to the private sector by the clearing banks -- which extend about
60 per cent of all bank advances to U.K. residents -- rose in this period
at a 12 per cent annual rate. The Bank of England has indicated to the
clearing banks that it would frown on a rise of more than 5 per cent in
their advances in the 12 months to mid-Mlarch 1971, but the ceiling implied
by this moral suasion was nearly reached in September.

IV -22
The expansion in bank lending has been marked by substantial
increases in both personal and business loans. Companies have sought
funds from banks rather than from bond issues because of the high interest
rates on bonds -- now considerably higher than rates on bank loans -- and
possibly by expectations of interest rate declines. To curb clearing bank
lending the Bank of England may soon raise the requirement for special
deposits maintained by the clearing banks with the Bank.
Bond yields in Britain rose sharply following the mid-April
presentation of the late Labor Government's budget which, by confirming
the abandonment of incomes policy, weakened hopes of curbing the wage-price
spiral. The slide in bond prices continued until the general election on
June 18, when the War Loan yield of 9.8 per cent showed a rise of about
140 basis points over its 1970 low in March. Following the Conservatives'
election victory yields fell until early August, but some of that decline
has now been reversed. The War Loan yield is currently about one-half
percentage point below the historic high in June.
In Italy, the Bank of Italy has not taken further active measures
to raise interest rates since Bank of Italy lending rates were upped last
March, but market interest rates have been allowed to rise in response to
expanding credit demands, adverse expectations for near-term bond prices,
and the elimination of artificial limits on some rates. Bank of Italy
acquiescence in higher rates of interest has mirrored continuing concern
over the balance of payments and recognition that domestic demand pressures
were threatening to become excessive.

IV -23
In July, Italian banks raised their rate on large time deposits
(in lire) from 8 to 8.25 per cent. The existing annual interbank agree-
ment stipulating maximum interest rates paid for funds and minimum rates
on loans to customers expired at the end of February, and a new, agreement
did not go into effect until September. The published rate paid by banks
for interbank loans of up to one month held through April at 5 per cent,
the upper limit under the expired agreement, but by the end of June this
rate had soared to 9.25 per cent, where it has remained at least through
August. The rate of 8.25 per cent currently being paid for 3-month lira
deposits compares with a rate of only 2.25 per cent under the expired
agreement, a limit which was universally violated by increasingly large
margins in 1969.
The new interbank agreement, effective September 1, which
this time does not cover interbank loans, sets realistic minimum
rates on loans to customers. It stipulates a maximum rate of 6 per
cent on large lira time deposits of all maturities, a level much below
rates now being paid on Euro-dollar deposits and domestic currency
time deposits in most industrial countries (notably excluding Switzerland).
But the ceiling rate on large-size demand deposits is higher, at 7 per
cent; because of differential tax treatment, the higher gross rate of
interest on demand deposits gives approximately the same after-tax
rate of interest on the two types of deposits. The savings banks and
cooperative banks, which hold 55 per cent of total bank deposits in
Italy, have yet to sign the new agreement. In a related move, effective

IV -24
October 1 the Bank of Italy raised from 3.75 to 5.5 per cent the rate
of interest it pays on banks' compulsory cash reserves, which currently
must equal 10 per cent of total deposits. In addition, the portion of
required reserves held in Treasury bills or (within limits) long-term
bonds issued by State enterprises and the special credit institutes is
being modified to permit a large portion to be held in bonds.
The composite yield on all bonds excluding Treasury bonds
advanced from 8,36 per cent in April (monthly average) to 9.43 per
cent in July, a figure that compares with 6.53 per cent 14 months
earlier before the recent large rise in yields. Bank demand for long-
term bonds was weakened by the surge in interbank loan rates. In
August the composite bond yield dropped sharply to 9.19 per cent,
probably in favorable reaction to the tax increases proposed by the
new Colombo government to reduce the budget deficit and contain the
expansion of domestic demand.
Financial market conditions in Japan remain tight, with
business demand for both fixed investment and working capital funds
continuing to be strong. The reserve positions of the large city banks
have been tight and companies are continuing to experience a liquidity
squeeze. In the third quarter there was a slight easing of Bank of Japan
restraints on commercial bank credit expansion, but in mid-September the
Governor of the Bank of Japan announced his intention of maintaining both
the present discount rate level and strict controls on the volume of bank
lending.

IV -25
The call money rate has continued at 8.25 or 8.50 per cent,
while the average rate charged by banks on loans and discounts has
shown a slight further rise, climbing from 7.64 per cent in April to
7.67 per cent in July (compared with 7.35 per cent in July 1969).
The average yield on private industrial bonds, shown in the table,
has dipped, but other yields do not suggest an easing of bond market
conditions. In fact, interest rates on long-term bank loans continued
to rise through July, and on September 1 the Japan Development Bank
increased its interest rate on most new loans from 8.2 to 8.5 per cent.
