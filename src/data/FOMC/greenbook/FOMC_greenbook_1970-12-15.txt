SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK
Nonfinancial
It now appears likely that real GNP will decline at an annual
rate of about 2 per cent this quarter. The decline is attributable to
the extended GM strike, with the return to full production taking some-
what longer than we had earlier anticipated. Discounting the strike
and its secondary effects, however, expansive vigor still appears quite
limited.
Industrial production is tentatively estimated to have declined
about one-half per cent further from October to November to a level 7.5
per cent below the high of July 1969 (5.0 per cent, apart from the strike
effects). Auto assemblies were about unchanged from the reduced Octo-
ber pace, but output of defense and business equipment continued to de-
cline, with the latter down about 12 per cent from its October 1969 high.
Retail sales have continued sluggish and several recent surveys suggest
some further deterioration in consumer attitudes.
The labor market continued weak in November,with a further in-
crease in the unemployment rate to 5.8 per cent. Manufacturing employ-
ment dropped 135,000 further, with widespread weakness in the durable
goods industries. In nonmanufacturing activities, a decline in trade
employment was about offset by increases in services and State and local
government.
The GNP price deflator is projected to increase at a 4.2 per
cent annual rate in the fourth quarter, somewhat more than anticipated
earlier but less than in the third quarter. Industrial wolesale prices

I- 2
from October to November were unchanged--for the first time in two
years--while prices of farm products and foods declined, On the other
hand, the latest reading on the consumer price index--for October--
showed an annual rate of increase of 6.5 per cent, about the same as
in September, This recent upsurge follows an interval in which the
pace of increase in this index seemed to be moderating.
Outlook. The projected increase of about $5.5 billion in
nominal GNP in the fourth quarter is the smallest of the past year.
The GM strike--including its effects on supplying industries--is
estimated to have cut roughly $8 billion (annual rate) from the rise
in nominal GNP in the fourth quarter, following an estimated $2 billion
loss in the third quarter. The estimated strike loss thus cumulates
to a $10 billion effect on the level of GNP, most of which is likely
to be made up in the first quarter of 1971. On this basis, we are
projecting a very large rise of about $26.5 billion in first quarter
GNP, with real output expected to rise at an annual rate of nearly
6 per cent. Taking the fourth and first quarters together, however,
growth in real GNP would average only about 2 per cent.
In the second and subsequent quarters of next year, increases
in GNP are projected at about $16 to $17 billion and real growth at an
annual rate of 2.5 to 3 per cent. Continued sizable advances in resi-
dential construction activity and in State and local purchases, reflect-
ing ample availability of funds, provide muchof the upward impetus. Bus-
iness expenditures on plant and equipment are projected to remain relatively

I -3
flat over this period and to decline further in real terms. For the year,
dollar outlays would be 1 per cent below those for 1970 and somewhat
weaker than suggested by recent surveys. Following a post-strike bulge
in the first quarter, growth in consumer spending is expected to rise
at a relatively moderate pace for the balance of the year.
At the growth rates we are projecting for real GNP, the unem-
ployment rate is expected to trend upward throughout the year. While
resource use thus is likely to slacken further, there are a number of
reasons for expecting only gradual moderation in the pace of overall
price increase. In view of prospective sizable increases in wage rates,
manufactured product prices will be reflecting a continued updrift in
unit labor costs. In addition, relative stability in retail food prices
in recent months may give way to some rise next year. Finally, there is
little reason for expecting any important moderation in the upward trend
of service prices, except for home financing costs.
Financial
Declines in market rates since the last meeting of the Committee
have ranged generally to as much as one-half to three-quarters of a per-
centage point in both short and long-term markets. Further cuts in the
discount and bank prime rates, evidence of additional weakness in the
economy, and expectations of further easing in monetary policy have
contributed to these declines, encouraging investors to bid aggressively
for the very large continuing flow of new corporate and municipal se-
curity offerings.
A key factor in the prime rate cuts was the continued shrinkage

I -4
of outstanding business loans at banks. Loan repayments from the pro-
ceeds of capital market financings, auto-strike effects, and the general
sluggishness of economic activity appear to have been mainly responsible
for this persisting weakness. Since other loans were also on the weak
side, while deposit inflows remained sizeable, banks have continued to
add substantially to their security holdings.
Growth of the money stock in November was up a bit from the
very slow pace of October, but transactions demands for cash were held
down by sluggish economic activity, which included the effects of the
auto strike. Although interest-bearing deposits at commercial banks
expanded somewhat less rapidly than in October and the third quarter,
growth of these deposits remained large. Moreover, the adjusted bank
credit proxy rose considerably more than in October, as repayment of
nondeposit liabilities slowed down somewhat and U. S. Government de-
posits rose.
Fragmentary information from non-bank thrift institutions
suggests that their savings inflows also remained strong during November,
reportedly encouraging a continuation of the heavy build-up of mortgage
loan commitments that has occurred in recent months. The general down-
ward pressure on mortgage rates being exerted by these developments led
officials to reduce the ceiling rate on FHA and VA mortgages from 8-1/2
to 8 per cent, effective December 1.
Outlook. A significant slackening in the volume of new security
issues is now widely forecast for the first quarter of next year. Fed-
erally sponsored housing finance agencies are expected to be sizeable net

I -5
repayers of debt over the period; the U. S. Treasury--which frequently
has been a large seasonal borrower in January--is not expected to need
additional new cash until late February or early March (beyond the minor
remaining scheduled additions to regular bill auctions in December);
and most analysts anticipate some moderation in the volume of corp-
orate security offerings as well. While business needs for external
financing will remain large, and the queue of unsatisfied capital mar-
ket borrowers is reportedly still long (particularly among lesser-rated
firms), the effort to improve liquidity by restructuring debt may have
passed its crest. Also, with commercial banks apparently again solic-
iting business borrowers more actively, some corporate substitution
of bank funds for capital market financing seems likely. The market
for State and local government securities is, thus, the only sector
where new issue volume is expected to expand. The Board's latest
quarterly survey of State and local financing anticipations suggests
that volume in this market may rise to a new record after the turn
of the year.
At commercial banks, business loans will very likely strength-
en somewhat as the economy recovers from the effects of the auto strike.
But it is not clear that bank efforts to stimulate a significant pick-
up of business borrowing, including a diversion of borrowers from mar-
ket sources to banks, can be very effective at current interest rates.
Despite the earlier cuts, the current spread of the prime rate over
the commercial paper rate is still wide. The degree of interest by
banks in CD funds will depend in part on their success in attracting

I -6
business borrowers and also on reactions to recent Board decisions affect-
ing Euro-dollar borrowings.
With the competitive position of consumer-type accounts at bank
and non-bank institutions substantially strengthened by recent sharp
declines of market interest rates, inflows to such accounts are likely
to be well maintained over the months ahead, absent a sharp drop in the
saving rate. Assuming that the money supply continues to grow in a
5-6 per cent annual rate range, long-term interest rates will probably
continue to trend down, although there may very well be periods of hesi-
tation and temporary reversal along the way as market participants pause
to take stock of underlying economic and financial tendencies. Short-
term interest rates may already have made most of their adjustment, how-
ever, (given the above money supply assumption) in view of the projected
first quarter resurgence in auto output, sales, and associated credit
demands.
International developments and the balance of payments
The pause in the rise of industrial production abroad this
year--which has spread to Japan since midyear--has had adverse effects
on the U. S. balance of trade on the side of imports as well as of
exports. This is a consequence of the easing of demand-supply condi-
tions in world markets for semi-manufactured materials such as steel
and textiles. Imports in October were even higher than in September,
when they had risen instead of declining as had been expected. Imports
of steel and of textile yarns and fabrics have been significantly larger
than last spring, and the rise in total imports since last spring is

I- 7
more than fully accounted for by increased purchases from continental
Europe and Japan. Talk of new import quotas may have been an addi-
tional factor, but it has not brought any abnormal inflow of finished
apparel and footwear.
On the export side, sales of steel, aluminum, and chemicals
have been lower in recent months than they were last spring. Total
exports, however, have risen in line with expectations because exports
this autumn of agricultural products such as soybeans, wheat, and ani-
mal feed grains have been larger than expected. Aircraft shipments
picked up in October, as scheduled.
The September and October trade statistics make it look very
unlikely that earlier projections of a $3-1/2 billion rate of trade
surplus in the current quarter--and a $5-1/2 billion rate of net ex-
ports of goods and services--can be realized. In the 4th-quarter
column of the GNP table we have marked down the net export figure to $5
billion, which may still prove to be high.
The generally accepted projections of real GNP in major in-
dustrial countries still call for considerable growth in European and
Japanese economic activity next year, though at a slower pace than in
the past two years and with much less strain on resources. The further
growth in these economies and an upturn in Canada will help to sustain
growth of world trade and, in particular, U. S. exports, but U. S. sales
to European countries in the near term are likely to grow only slowly
beyond current levels.
The over-all deficit in the balance of payments appears to

I-8
have been running in October and November at an annual rate of about
$3 billion on the liquidity basis before special transactions. On
the official settlements basis, the deficit was extremely large in
October and November (taking the two months together). The Board's
action in amending the reserve requirements on Eurodollar borrowings
has checked the run-off in bank liabilities to foreign branches for
the time being, so that a much more favorable December balance on
official settlements now seems probable.
There is insufficient evidence yet, either on trade or on
capital flows, to call for a modification of the balance of payments
projection for 1971 given at the last meeting of the Committee, which
suggested that if unrecorded capital outflows were not unusually large,
the adjusted liquidity deficit might be about $3 billion next year.
The decline in U. S. interest rates and the upturn in the stock market
may be having mixed effects on flows of capital. It remains especially
difficult to predict U. S. banks' Eurodollar repayments at any distance
ahead.

THE ECONOMIC PICTURE IN DETAIL
Domestic Nonfinancial Scene
Gross national product. Recent data suggest a further
weakening of activity in November. Although the effects of the GM
strike were still distorting underlying economic trends, production
and employment cuts occurred in sectors not affected by the strike,
and retail sales continued sluggish. We are now anticipating an
increase of only $5-1/2 billion in GNP in the fourth quarter rather
than the $9 billion projected in the last Greenbook. Moreover, it now
appears likely that the GNP deflator will rise more rapidly than we had
earlier thought, and real GNP is projected to decline by 2 per cent,
annual rate, from the third quarter.
Consumer demand appears to be even more sluggish than we had
been estimating. Retail sales, excluding autos, showed no gain in
November according to weekly data, and in real terms were little higher
than a year earlier. Unit sales of domestic-type cars dropped from
about 6 million, annual rate, in October to 5 million in November. While
this decline reflected for the most part the increasing scarcity of GM
cars, sales of non-GM models were running no better, or possibly slightly
under, the pre-strike rate.

Because of the recent sluggishness of auto demand, as well
as the fact that GM is taking somewhat longer to get into full produc-
tion than we had anticipated, we have cut back the projected rate of
December auto sales, and reduced our estimate of the fourth quarter
increase in consumer durable goods outlays by about $1-1/2 billion.
Another reason for our forecast of a smaller GNP increase
for the fourth quarter is the upward adjustment made by the Commerce
Department in the third quarter rate of inventory accumulation, from
$4.0 to $5.5 billion--part of which appears to have been involuntary.
Although the book value of manufacturing inventories rose strongly in
October, trade inventories declined sharply because of autos and
December should see a further depletion of dealer stocks. We thus_ 1_~__ ~______1_
__ ___

II -3
continue to carry a projection of no inventory accumulation in the
fourth quarter, and the decline from the third quarter rate of inventory
investment is now $1.5 billion greater than before.
The export surplus projected for the fourth quarter was also
revised down. This less optimistic outlook reflects a surprisingly
strong growth of imports over the past few months--particularly of
industrial materials and machinery.
In other sectors, we are now projecting a somewhat larger
downturn in business fixed investment outlays this quarter, reflecting
mainly lower GM sales of cars and trucks to business. On the positive
side, it still appears likely that we will have a strong gain in
residential construction outlays and a moderate gain in State and local
expenditures.

Activity in the early months of next year will likely be
dominated by the recovery of auto production, with the major impact
evident in higher consumer durable goods outlays, and to a lesser
extent on inventories and business fixed investment. We are now pro-
jecting an increase in GNP of about $26-1/2 billion in the first quarter,
significantly larger than formerly, and real GNP rises at an annual rate
of close to 6 per cent. With the return to full production by GM now
apparently not likely till close to year end, the increase in auto out-
put between the fourth and first quarters should be larger than we had
earlier estimated, despite the fact that we have reduced somewhat the
projected rate of auto sales for 1971. Consumer outlays for nondurable
goods and services also are expected to rise slightly more, supported
by larger Federal transfer payments. These transfers are now estimated
to total about $1-1/2 billion more per quarter in the first half of
next year; by the end of the 1971 calendar year, they are expected to
total about $3 billion more than our previous estimates.
Growth in GNP in the second quarter is expected to slip back
to about $16-1/2 billion, following the first quarter catch-up in auto
output and sales. (We have continued to exclude from these projections
any assumption of a probable build-up of steel inventories as a strike
hedge in the first two quarters and an offsetting decline later in the
year.) The second quarter increase is also larger than we had formerly
projected, due in part to more of a rise in consumer spending and in
part to a smaller decline in defense outlays than estimated before. In
addition, we continue to project a retroactive Federal pay raise of $2.8

II -5
billion for the second quarter. (Following the procedure used by
Commerce last year, these outlays are included in Federal purchases in
the GNP accounts in the first quarter, but are treated as a $5.6
billion increase in personal income in the second quarter, when they
are assumed to be paid out.)
In the second half of 1971 GNP growth is projected to continue
at about the second quarter rate, averaging around $17 billion a quarter.
We continue to make the same assumption with respect to monetary policy
in 1971 as in the recent chart show. Reflecting the more favorable
financial atmosphere, increases in residential construction activity and
in State and local outlays are expected to provide additional impetus to
overall growth. Federal government purchases and business fixed invest-
ment appear likely to be more or less neutral factors, while gains in
consumer demand are expected to continue moderate after mid-year,
supported in part by larger transfer payments. Since increases in
employment and income are projected to be small and gains in disposable
income modest, the saving rate is expected to decline somewhat from the
second quarter.
Despite the projected rapid increase in the first quarter of
1971, the rate of real growth over the year as a whole is still expected
to be significantly short of potential growth, and we are continuing to
project gradual increases in the unemployment rate through the end of
1971. With lessening pressure on resources, we expect further easing of
price pressures, but the recent strong increases in wages and consumer
prices have caused us to raise our earlier price projection, quarter by

II -6
quarter, for the year as a whole. In sum, the unemployment rate is
projected to rise to 6.7 per cent by the fourth quarter of 1971 while
the rate of increase in the GNP price deflator slows only to 3.4 per
cent.

Industrial production. Industrial production in November is
tentatively estimated to have declined a little over one-half per cent
further to a level of about 161.3 per cent compared with the preliminary
October figure of 162.3. Declines in output were centered in business
and defense equipment, some materials, and the auto supplying industries.
Auto assemblies in November were about unchanged from October
and the GM strike had little or no further direct effect on changes in
the index between these 2 months. Auto production schedules for December
are estimated at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 7 million units
compared with 4 million units in November. The rise in auto production
plus other direct and secondary effects due to the strike settlement will
probably add about 2 points or more to the total index in December.
Output of consumer goods other than autos probably changed
little in November. Production of television sets and appliances was
maintained at about the October level and output of furniture again
increased, but production of room air-conditioners was reduced further.
Among business equipment lines, output of industrial equipment
and commercial aircraft declined again, but production of commercial
equipment--mainly communication equipment--rose following 7 months of
decline.
Production of raw steel declined in November and trade reports
indicate some cutback in output of aluminum and some other nonferrous
metals. Production of paper and paperboard remained below year ago levels
and the employment data indicate output reductions in the rubber and
chemical industries from October to November.

II -10
Retail sales. Estimates based on data the four weeks ending
November 28 suggest that retail sales in November were 1.0 to 1.5 per
cent lower than now shown by the preliminary figures for October. Even
exclusive of the automotive group, sales apparently were down slightly.
In November, sales of new domestic autos declined to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5 million units, down nearly a fifth
from October and two-fifths from a year earlier. Sales of imported cars
were at an annual rate of 1.4 million, up 5 per cent from last month and
10 per cent above a year aarlier. Dealers' stocks of domestic autos
continued to decline and at the end of November were a fourth below the
mid-summer high and 30 per cent below a year earlier.
According to the preliminary estimate, retail sales in October
declined 1.3 per cent, about the same as shown by the advance figures.
The revised figures show September sales edging up a trifle rather than
unchanged. Sales of the automotive group were off 13 per cent in
October,primarily because of the GM strike, but other sales were up 1.5
per cent, with relatively large gains at furniture and appliance stores
and apparel stores.
Consumer credit. Reflecting in part the effect of the GM
strike, there was a sharp decrease in the volume of auto financing
during October which in turn was responsible for the first monthly
decline in total consumer instalment credit outstanding since April
1961. On a seasonally adjusted annual rate basis, the overall reduction
in October amounted to $1.0 billion; automobile credit fell at a $2.4

II -11
billion rate but there were partially offsetting increases in nonauto-
motive consumer goods and personal loans.
The reduced volume of lending activity and the large inflow
of repayments and deposits has enabled a number of major commercial banks
to announce across-the-board reductions in interest rates on consumer
loans. Rates on consumer loans--which tend to be less flexible than
other interest rates--were generally last increased during late 1968
and early 1969 when they reached maximum legal ceilings in some states,
such as New York. The recent decreases have amounted to about 1/2 per
cent on a simple annual interest rate basis. Consumer loan rates vary
widely across the country, however; even after announced reductions, the
rate on personal loans at a major California bank is about 14-1/2 per
cent (simple annual interest) while in New York a similar bank loan may
be available in a range of 11 to 12-3/4 per cent.
Consumer surveys. The latest round of consumer surveys by
Census, the National Industrial Conference Board, and the Michigan
Survey Research Center all indicate a worsening of consumer attitudes.
The Census survey taken in October reported a decline in expected car
purchases and a further deterioration of family income expectations.
The National Industrial Conference Board survey for September-October
reported poorer business and income expectations, lower auto purchase
plans and fewer plans to purchase a major appliance in the next six
months. In both the Census and NICB surveys, however, there was some
increase in home purchase plans.

II -12
The October-November index of consumer sentiment--compiled
by the Michigan Survey Research Center (SRC) from five attitudinal
questions on market conditions for household durables, expected business
conditions, and present and expected personal financial situations--
declined over 4-1/2 percentage points to 72.4 (February 1966 = 100), a
new low for the series. Most of the decline was attributable to more
pessimistic forecasts of one-year and five-year business conditions and
an increased belief that now was a bad time to buy household durables.
The Michigan survey also indicated that consumers were very
concerned with the possibility of future unemployment and existing
inflationary pressures, although price fears did not intensify from the
preceding survey. Automobile purchase plans were lower than a year
earlier, as they have been all year. Purchase plans for household dur-
ables were also lower.
The Survey Research Center suggests, however, that the index
of sentiment must always be interpreted in conjunction with actual
changes in disposable income. Since disposable personal income has
increased during the year--and consumers' evaluation of their present
financial condition compared with a year earlier has not changed much--
the Center believes that consumer expenditures will probably be higher
than suggested by the index and will remain about the same relative to
disposable income as in the first three quarters of this year. This
ratio, of course, has been relatively low.

Manufacturers' new orders. New orders for durable goods
dropped 4 per cent in October, according to preliminary data, although
defense and capital equipment orders rose. The decline occurred mainly
in motor vehicles and steel, reflecting the GM strike, but orders for
household durables were also off and orders at the construction materials
industries dropped back from a record September rate. On a six-months
average basis, orders for defense hardware are now 21 per cent above a
year earlier. The October increase for capital equipment brought this
category of orders back to about their August level. Orders for nondur-
able goods were unchanged.

in unfilled orders were largest for primary metals, both ferrous and
nonferrous, and for capital equipment; despite the increase in new
orders for capital goods, this backlog continued to decline, reaching
a level 12 per cent below its peak last December. (Motor vehicle
assembly plants do not report unfilled orders and for them new orders
are equivalent to shipments, so that the presumed increase in backlog
demands for autos is not reflected in the new or unfilled orders series.)
Business inventories. The book value of manufacturing and
trade inventories combined rose at an annual rate of only $0.7 billion
in October as a sharp reduction of stocks at auto dealers about offset
substantial increases at manufacturers and wholesalers. The minimal
October increase compares to a rise at an annual rate of $8.1 billion
in September and $10.7 billion over the third quarter.

The step-up in inventory growth at manufacturers was largely
in the auto and steel industries, with the latter apparently willing
to accept inventory increases while anticipating both a resumption of
auto buying and pre-steel-contract-expiration stockpiling by steel users
early next year. There was also an increase in inventory growth in
October at home goods and apparel manufacturers. The rate of book value
growth was about unchanged for consumer staples, capital equipment, and
construction materials, while defense products inventories declined more
than they had in September.
The inventory-shipments ratio rose sharply at durable goods
manufacturers to the highest level since early 1961, and the nondurable
goods ratio increased slightly. The increases mainly reflected the
strike effects, with shipments down sharply in autos and steel while
stocks rose. However, stocks of home goods and apparel also rose rela-
tive to shipments and unfilled orders, and capital equipment inventories
rose further relative to unfilled orders. The defense inventory/backlog
ratio was reduced further. Inventory/backlog ratios rose in a number of
industries not affected by the auto strike, such as aircraft and several
of the industrial machinery manufacturing industries.

Cyclical indicators. The preliminary composite leading
indicator rose 0.8 per cent in October and was 1.7 per cent above the
May low. The coincident composite declined, as the GM strike depressed
employment, production, and incomes in the auto-related sectors, with
little offsetting strength elsewhere. The lagging composite rose
slightly. The inclusion of the newly available figure for corporate
profits resulted in an upward revision of the composite leading indexes
for July through September.

The increase in the leading composite in October resulted
from a sharp rise in housing permits and small increases in the manu-
facturing workweek, the ratio of price to unit labor cost, and the
common stock price index. Partly offsetting downward influences were
provided by unemployment insurance claims, new orders for durable goods,
contracts and orders for plant and equipment, and industrial materials
prices.

II -18
The October increases in the leading composite may not hold
up. Data for October not yet incorporated in the preliminary figure
include the change in consumer instalment debt, which was negative, and
a sharp decline in inventory change. Fourth quarter corporate profits
may well decline because of the GM strike.
In November, the preliminary price index for industrial
materials declined, initial unemployment claims may provide some further
downward influence, and the monthly average of common stock prices was
down slightly in spite of increases late in the month. The manufacturing
workweek was up slightly.
Construction and real estate. Seasonally adjusted value of
new construction put in place, which had advanced to a new high in
September, changed little in October or November. At a record annual
rate of $93.4 billion, the rate in November was 5 per cent above a year
earlier in current dollars. However, in real terms as measured by the
Census Bureau, it was still about 2 per cent below a year earlier and a
tenth under its peak in January 1969.
In contrast with developments in the other major sectors,
residential construction continued upward for the fifth consecutive
month in November, and on a current dollar basis was nearly 15 per cent
above the low of last June, although still somewhat short of the high
achieved in April 1969. Outlays for nonresidential construction appar-
ently changed little from the reduced October rate, and were 5 per cent
under their peak of last March, reflecting mainly a sharp curtailment

II -19
in outlays for office and other commercial buildings. Public construc-
tion outlays edged off in November largely because of a drop in outlays
for Federally owned projects, which are a relatively small proportion
of the total and tend to be particularly volatile. Outlays for State
and local projects, according to very preliminary Census Bureau estimates,
have apparently changed little since June, at a level only moderately
below their high in February of 1969.

Seasonally adjusted private housing starts continued upward
In October. Although the October rise was concentrated entirely in
multi-family units, and in two of the four major regions, it was notably
strong in those sectors and carried the over-all average to an annual
rate of 1.55 million units--next to July, the highest for any month this
year. Moreover, with building permits and aggregate mortgage commitment
activity unusually high, indications now are that starts in the fourth

II -20
quarter as a whole may reach a rate of at least 1.58 million units,
Such a rate would compare with 1.51 million rate in the third quarter
and would be the highest for any quarter since early 1969.

September--the latest month for which data are available--were at
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 428,000, up 5 per cent from
August, and nearly 3 per cent higher than a year earlier.
Rental vacancy rates, which had tended to stabilize earlier
this year, edged off in the third quarter to 4.9 per cent of all rental
units available and fit for use. This was the lowest average for any
third quarter in the history of the regular series which began in 1956.
Home-owners vacancy rates--a much less sensitive series than that for
rental vacancies--turned upward slightly, but the average of 1.0 per
cent was also low, and compared with a third quarter high of 1.6 per
cent in 1963 and a level of 1.3 per cent as recently as the third
quarter of 1967.

Anticipated spending for new plant and equipment. Business
reported plans to spend $80.6 billion on new plant and equipment this
year, up 6.6 per cent from 1969, according to the November Commerce-SEC
survey. While this expected increase is the same as reported in August,
it is down from the 9.8 per cent and 7.8 per cent reported in February
and May, respectively. According to November plans, expenditures will
show little change in both the fourth quarter of 1970 and the first
quarter of 1971 and then rise in the second quarter.

Actual third quarter spending for plant and equipment was
somewhat greater than expected in the August survey mainly because of
larger than anticipated spending by both durable and nondurable goods
manufacturers--particularly in primary metals, nonelectrical machinery
and petroleum. Nonmanufacturing spending came in a bit lower due to
cutbacks from plans in railroads, airlines, utilities, and mining
companies.
For the first half of 1971 the rate of spending is expected
to equal that of the second half of 1970, and to be about 3 per cent
higher than the first half of 1970. Most of the strength in early 1971
is expected to come from utilities and communications firms. In manu-
facturing spending for plant and equipment is expected to continue to
decline. It might be noted that the $82.2
billion annual rate indicated for the second quarter 1971 would be about
equal to the figure implied by the 2 per cent increase for the year 1971
shown in the McGraw-Hill fall survey.
New appropriations by the 1,000 largest manufacturers accord-
ing to the Conference Board survey rose 8 per cent in the third quarter,
mostly in petroleum. Excluding petroleum (which is subject to very
large swings) the increase was only 2 per cent. Durable goods manufac-
turers increased their appropriations almost 13 per cent as large gains
in the transportation equipment (including autos) industry more than
offset substantial declines in fabricated metals and electrical equipment.
A 3 per cent increase in nondurables was entirely due to petroleum;
sizable declines were reported in most other industries. Current esti-
mates indicate that total appropriations will show little change in the
fourth quarter. Given the lag of about three quarters between

II -23
appropriations and expenditures, the third quarter rise in appropria-
tions would suggest leveling off or, perhaps, a slight pickup in manu-
facturing about mid-year 1971.
Labor market. The labor market continued to slacken in
November, reflecting further secondary effects of the General Motors
strike and weakness elsewhere in the economy. Nonfarm payroll employment
dropped 134,000, with large declines in durable-goods manufacturing and
trade. The unemployment rate increased from 5.6 per cent in October to
5.8 per cent, reflecting both layoffs of full time workers and an increase
in the number of young women who entered the labor market seeking full-
time employment. Unemployment among women aged 20 to 24 years jumped
sharply, while unemployment among males aged 25 years and over edged up
slightly to 3.3 per cent. Rates for men over 20 years of age have about
doubled in the past year. Joblessness rose in most occupations in
November, with particularly large increases in white-collar categories.

Employment. Manufacturing employment was further reduced by
136,000 in November after a drop of 560,000 in October. The November
decline reflected additional layoffs at auto supplier plants and weak-
ness in defense-related and capital goods industries. Particularly
hard hit were the metal producing and metal fabricating industries as
well as chemicals and rubber. The few manufacturing industries posting
gains were concentrated in nondurable goods. The November drop included
26,000 nonproduction workers, bringing the net decline in this group to
more than 200,000 over the past year.
Hours of work in manufacturing edged up 0.1 hour to 39.5
hours in November, but remained well below the August level. The
November workweek was one hour shorter than a year earlier, largely
reflecting the reduction in average overtime from 3.5 to 2.5 hours.
Outside of manufacturing, the largest employment decline was
in trade. The job loss of 85,000 reflected general wekkness in retail
sales as well as the effect of the auto strike which accounted for an
estimated one-third of the decline. Trade employment was up only 72,000
over the year ending in November, a much smaller rise than usual for
this industry. Employment in construction was unchanged in November for
the second successive month after declining rapidly in the first three
quarters of this year.

Growth in the service industries and State and local govern-
ment has served as an important offset to weakness in employment in
other sectors. Over the year, employment in services and finance rose
by over 400,000 and State and local government increased by more than
half a million. These large gains, however, were not sufficient to
offset the declines in manufacturing, construction and Federal employ-
ment and in November total nonfarm employment was 700,000 below a year
earlier.
Industrial relations. The agreement on a new contract by GM
and the UAW was followed by a similar settlement at Ford (still subject
to ratification). Full production at GM is being delayed, however, by

II -26
the continued strike of 23,000 Canadian workers who have not concluded
a new agreement. In addition, workers continue on strike at three
assembly plants and several smaller plants over local issues. As soon
as GM and Canadian workers reach agreement, a settlement should follow
shortly at Chrysler where one contract covers both U.S. and Canadian
workers.
As a result of the recent GM agreement, cost-of-living
escalator clauses will probably receive more emphasis. The wage
increase in the GM settlement included a 33-cent "catch-up", the amount
that would have been provided by an escalator clause had a maximum not
been placed on such adjustments by terms of the 1967 contract. Labor
unions in up-coming negotiations in cans, aluminum, steel, copper, and
aerospace will also probably press for a large "catch-up" and new or
unlimited cost-of-living escalator clauses.
In the railroad industry, recommendations of the panel
appointed by the President have not been accepted by the unions, partly
because of work rule changes. Since it appears unlikely that a settle-
ment will be reached before the December 10 strike deadline, the
President has requested Congress to extend the strike ban for 45 days.

II -27
Wholesale prices. Wholesale prices declined in November
(October 13 to November 10) by 1.1 per cent at a seasonally adjusted
annual rate. Industrial prices were unchanged for the first time
since November 1968, and farm and food products dropped at a rate of
4.1 per cent. This presents a sharp contrast with October when
industrial commodities--reflecting in part large increases for
automotive products at the time of the introduction of new models--
rose at a rate of almost 8 per cent and appeared to reverse a
trend toward a slower rate of price rise.

In November, increases for fuels including electric power
rates, heating fuels, and gasoline again were among the most important
price advances, and since the November 10th pricing date, major
producers have announced increases for crude oil and gasoline. Machinery
and equipment rose at a slower rate than in other recent months. Among
commodities which showed declines, nonferrous metals dropped for the
sixth consecutive month and steel scrap was lower. Lumber and wood
products reached the lowest level since mid-1968--partly for seasonal
reasons.
Producer finished products have increased faster this year
than last despite declining prices of crude raw materials from March
to November and a drop in intermediate materials since mid-year. The
rise in machinery and equipment has paralleled that of last year while
passenger cars have increased much more. Recent large increases in
producer finished products apparently reflect to a large extent the
predominant importance of increased labor costs.

Nonferrous metals have fallen further during the last
month as the effects of the General Motors strike have added to
generally slack demands. Discounts on some aluminum fabricated
products have been increased, and copper ingot prices have been
further reduced by U.S. producers in response to falling world prices.
In November, price declines for livestock and meat accounted
for most of the 4 per cent rate of decline in farm products and
processed food and feeds. Little change in prices of livestock is
foreseen this winter by the Department of Agriculture, as the
Department expects hogs to edge up slightly seasonally and prices
of cattle to exhibit only small changes.
Consumer prices. Consumer prices rose in October at a sea-
sonally adjusted annual rate of about 6-1/2 per cent, the same as in
September and much more than in the three preceding months. Indeed,
the increases were comparable to those in the first quarter when food
costs and particularly mortgage rates rose rapidly. But in contrast
to the first quarter, the October rise was in large part attributable
to non-food commodities while both services and food prices advanced
more slowly than early in the year. New and used cars, household
durables, gasoline and apparel all contributed to the October increase.

Both 1970 and 1971 model cars figured in the 12 per cent annual
rate of rise in new car prices; in addition, there was a sharp reversal
in prices of used cars (which have almost as large a weight as new cars
in the CPI). With the strike-induced delay in sales of 1971 models, prices
of cars may continue to move higher for several months as the mix of
sales between 1970 and 1971 models changes. However, in view of less
than seasonal declines in prices of 1970 models, the increase may be
moderate. The rise in household durable goods prices accelerated in
October, but home purchase prices rose less rapidly.

II -31
Among nondurables, gasoline and apparel prices rose strongly.
October represents the third successive month with a rate of increase
for apparel of 6 per cent or more. This advance may slow soon in res-
ponse to deferments of textile wage increases. Moreover, post-Christmas
sales could be large, as in January of this year.

The October seasonally adjusted increase for food--a rate of
0.9 per cent--reflected stability in grocery store prices at levels
similar to March and April, and a slower increase for food away from home.
Fruit and vegetable prices fell about seasonally, and egg prices
declined counter-seasonally. Avery prices for meat, poultry, and fish
showed a small net rise after seasonal adjustment, in spite of the drop
in pork prices.

II -32
The annual adjustment for previous over-estimate of health
insurance costs reduced the rate of rise for services by about one
per cent, to an annual rate of 6.3 per cent. Rents rose at a rate
of 5.9 per cent, more than in any month since July 1956, with adjust-
ments in rent-controlled units in New York and increases in other
cities.
GNP price measures. Although the GNP deflator is widely
used as a broad measure of price developments for the economy, it has
deficiencies. One of these is that the weights shift from period to
period as the composition of output changes; moreover, since the price
of public employees' services is measured by average employee compen-
sation, changes in both Federal and State-local pay-scales and
in the salary-mix of employees appear as price changes. Both of these
factors, but particularly the latter, have introduced distortions in
the deflator over the past year.

The GNP deflator rose at an annual rate of about 4.6 per cent
in the third quarter of this year compared to 6.4 per cent in the first
quarter. Part of the drop was the result of changes in the composition
of expenditures; a fixed-weight index (using either 1958 weights, as
in the "Inflation Alert," or the more recent fourth quarter of 1965
weights) indicates a smaller decline. However, the drop derives largely
from developments in the Federal sector, in particular the general pay
increase for Federal employees in the first quarter. The fixed weight
indexes for the private economy have risen at a fairly steady rate of
close to 5 per cent over the last year, reflecting offsetting move-
ments in major sectors.
The drop in the rate of price increase for the Federal
government is shown clearly in the second table which presents fixed-
weight (1965-IV) price indexes for major sectors. The consumer
expenditure deflator exhibits a slower rate of rise in the second
and third quarters than earlier this year and this can be traced almost
entirely to improvement in the food supply. The investment goods
index, on the other hand, shows an acceleration in cost increases
which is almost entirely attributable to construction costs. Producers'
durables prices have risen at a fairly steady rate over the last year
and a half. The high rate of increase in the price index for State-
local government, reflecting both salary and construction costs,
has shown no tendency to moderate.

New farm legislation. The Agricultural Act of 1970, signed
by the President on November 30, extends essentially the same type of
price support and payment programs in effect since 1965 for another
three years. Wheat, cotton, and feed grain farmers are given more
flexibility in the crops they plant and payments will continue to be
an important source of income to these producers. The Act provides
programs for milk, wool, wheat, feed grains, and cotton; extends
P.L. 480 (the "Food for Peace" program); continues the long-term land
use adjustment program on a small scale; and makes some small
commitments to rural development.
A new "set-aside" approach will replace the acreage diversion
provisions required by the Act of 1965 on wheat, cotton, and the feed
grains. As explained by the Secretary of Agriculture, the concept
behind the "set-aside" is that the excessive amount of cropland avail-
able is general rather than specific as to certain crops and that if a
proper amount of cropland is set aside, farmers will make good
decisions as to how to use their remaining acreage. "Set-asides" are
to be imposed whenever it appears that surplus supplies of these
commodities are likely to develop. Farmers must comply with the "set-
asides" and, in addition, maintain their old Act of 1965 soil conserving
basis in order to be eligible for price support loans and payments.
On their remaining cropland they are permitted considerably more
latitude than formerly in selecting crops that will give the
greatest return. Maximum "set-asides" are stipulated for cotton and
wheat.

II -36
How farmers will react in 1971 to the more flexible
planting patterns permitted by the "set-aside" approach is hard
to predict and the uncertainties caused by the corn blight complicate
the picture. The USDA announced tentative programs implementing
the wheat, cotton, and feed grain programs on December 8. A survey
of farmers' planting intentions will be made as of January 1 to see
how they are responding to the programs, and final program announcements
will be made after the survey results have been analyzed. The
Secretary has authority to limit acreages of any of the program crops
if it appears that surplus supplies are likely to accumulate.
Another new feature of the Act of 1970 is the setting of
an annual ceiling of $55,000 per crop on payments to producers of
wheat, cotton, and feed grains. This provision was apparently
included to increase public acceptance of the Act rather than to
reduce payment costs. If such a limitation had been in effect in
1969, 1,100 producers would have been affected, mostly cotton producers,
and aggregate, payments would have been reduced by about 2 per cent.

THE ECONOMIC PICTURE IN DETAIL
Domestic Financial Situation
Monetary aggregates. Growth in the money stock (M) in
November, on the basis of newly revised data, was at an annual rate
of 2.8 per cent, a little faster than in October. A slowdown in the
rate of currency expansion was more than offset by a small rise in
privately-held demand deposits, which had shown a decline in October.
The relative weakness in growth of M 1 since September appears to have
been due in part to the effects of the auto strike; similar weaknesses
were evident at the time of earlier major strikes. Corporations also
may have reduced their compensating balances as they repaid loans.
In any event, the slowing in money growth occurred in the face of
sharp declines over this period in short-term interest rates.

Average time deposits increased at a 15 per cent seasonally
adjusted annual rate from October to November, about 5 percentage
points less than the September to October increase and one-half the
third quarter rate. The recent slower growth was principally a
reflection of lessened bank desire to attract large negotiable CD's
at prevailing interest rates in view of reduced loan demands. The
seasonally unadjusted rise in CD's at weekly reporting banks was
greater than the usual change between October and November, but by
less than the corresponding comparison for October. Time deposits
other than CD's and consumer-type declined for the second consecutive
month, as banks were not interested in bidding for foreign official
funds. After rough allowance for seasonality, consumer-type deposits
rose at about the same strong rate as in October, but this was down
appreciably from the exceptional rates of increase of the summer months.

Even though total time deposit growth slowed in November,
the increase in the adjusted credit proxy, at more than a 7 per cent
annual rate, was well above the very slow rate of growth in October.
Much of the increase in the rate of growth of the credit proxy
was attributable to slower repayment by banks of their nondeposit
liabilities. Bank-related commercial paper outstanding and Euro-
dollars borrowed from branches included in the proxy together
declined $1.5 billion in November, or about one-third less than in
the previous month. In addition, banks received an increased volume
of funds from U.S. Government deposits.
Bank credit. Total loans and investments at all commercial
banks, adjusted to take account of amounts outstanding of loans sold
to affiliates, rose at an 8 per cent annual rate in November following
a slight decline in October. Banks acquired a moderate amount of
U.S. Government securities during November as they participated in
the Treasury exchange and cash financing that raised $1.3 billion net;
in October banks had reduced their holdings of Treasury issues
considerably. Net acquisitions of other securities totaled $2.4
billion in November, continuing the large amounts of recent months,
and accounted for most of the increase in bank credit. The bulk of
this rise in other securities was in short- and medium-term municipal
issues, but banks also acquired some longer-term municipal securities
as the yield structure made these issues increasingly attractive.
Weekly reporting banks also increased their takings of agency and other
securities in November.

Total loans (adjusted for sales) at commercial banks showed
a small increase in November, following a large contraction in October.
Commercial and industrial loans continued to show substantial weakness--
declining at about a 9 per cent annual rate. Over the past three
months, business loans adjusted for sales to affiliates have declined
on average at a 10.3 per cent annual rate. Corporations reportedly
are continuing to use some of the proceeds of capital market financings
to repay short-term bank debt. However, the auto strike, together
with generally sluggish economic activity, contributed to the slack in
loan demands.

III -6
In view of weakness in business loan demand, declining
market rates of interest, and sizable deposit inflows, banks have
reduced their prime lending rate twice during the past month--to a
level of 7 per cent. Moreover, banks reportedly have relaxed some
of their lending terms and conditions other than interest rates and
have begun to seek business loans more actively.1/ Most banks, however,
still appear to be quite quality conscious in their lending policies.
Loans to other than commercial and industrial firms were
also relatively weak in November. Security loans declined somewhat--
after rising in the previous month--in reflection of reduced financing
needs of U.S. Government and other security dealers. Consumer and
real estate loans continued to rise at the moderate rate of the past
few months.
Additions to the calendar have increased the staff's estimate
of public bond offerings for December to $2.2 billion, a less than
seasonal decline from November. Although public stock issues are
expected to show the normal seasonal decline in December, if the usual
year-end bulge in takedowns of private placements occurs, total corporate
offerings in December could be approximately $3.4 billion. Thus, it
appears that in 1970 total security issues will be 40 per cent greater
than in 1969; public bond offerings, which account for two-thirds of
the 1970 issue volume, are almost double their 1969 pace.
1/ Information on loan commitments may be found in Appendix B which
reports on the results of the most recent Loan Commitments Survey.
The Supplement to the Greenbook will contain a report on the most
recent Bank Lending Practices Survey.

III -7
The January forward calendar of bonds definitely scheduled
is now unusually modest by recent standards. Underwriters report that,
while the potential volume of corporate borrowing is still substantial,
firms are keeping their scheduling flexible to take advantage of
possible future interest rate declines. The staff is assuming that
January public bond offerings will ultimately reach $2 billion--a
substantial volume. However, the January pace could be smaller if
potential issuers continue to delay offerings in anticipation of still
lower interest rates.
In early December municipal bond yields were about 170 basis
points belo their 1970 high and 70 basis points below the level at
the time of the last FOMC meeting. Extremely heavy bank purchases--
including acquisitions of longer-term issues--continued to support the
prolonged rally in tax-exempt bonds. Sales of long-term securities
by State and local governments in November were somewhat below the
October level, but the December calendar has built up rapidly in recent
weeks. Thus, the staff now estimates that December offerings will be
about $1.3 billion, despite the holiday-shortened market period, and
expects the January volume to return to the higher levels of this Fall.
With the decline in rates and the large backlog of postponed borrowing,
anticipated borrowing in early 1971 by State and local units remains
high.1

Nonbank thrift institutions and mortgage markets. Indications
are that deposit inflows to thrift institutions during November were
maintained at the rapid pace of the previous two months. Trade reports
suggest that inflows in early November were about as large as in the
same period of 1967. Since then, the more marked decline in short-term
market yields has further enhanced the attractiveness of thrift
institution claims.

With savings inflows to thrift institutions thus apparently
continuing large, new mortgage commitment volume remained large in
November, according to trade opinion and field reports. At savings and
loan associations during October, new mortgage commitments rose further
and outstanding commitments reached a record high on a seasonally
adjusted basis. Savings and loan associations have accounted for most
of the recovery since last spring in total mortgage lending activity.

III -10
As demand for mortgage credit slackened for seasonal reasons
in November and as pressure on long-term rates eased, indications are
that yields on residential mortgages declined somewhat further, at
least on Government-underwritten loans. In line with these develop-
ments and with expectations of continued improvement, ceiling interest
rates on new FHA and VA mortgages were reduced by administrative action
to 8 per cent from 8-1/2 per cent, effective December 1. (The additional
insurance premium on FHA loans remained at an annual rate of 1/2 of 1
per cent.) This was the first reduction in nearly a decade in the
ceiling rate on Government underwritten mortgages.
The cut in the maximum permissible rate on these bellwether
loans gave impetus to the downtrend in mortgage yields that was already
under way in the secondary market. By December 7, auction yields for
FNMA s 6-month forward commitments, based on FHA and VA loans carrying
the new 8 per cent ceiling rate, were down to an average of 8.54 per
cent. This was 36 basis points below the November 16 auction, and the
lowest level in a year.
Despite the decline in yields to lenders, the 8 per cent
mortgages carried somewhat higher average discounts--4.2 points for
6-month forward commitments in FNMA's December 7 auction compared with
3.1 points in the November 16 auction for 8-1/2 per cent loans. The
larger number of points will, of course, tend to dampen the stimulative
effect of the rate cut on market activity in the short run, no matter
whether they are absorbed by home sellers (including builders) in reduced
profits or are passed on to buyers in higher home prices. By administra-
tive regulation, home buyers are permitted to pay directly no more than
one discount point.

of 15 years for 30-year Government-underwritten mortgages. Implicit yields
shown are gross, before deduction of fee paid by investors to servicers of
50 basis points prior to August 10, 1970, auction, and 38 basis points
thereafter. The bi-weekly auction scheduled for November 30 was postponed
to December 7.
The reduced interest rate and lower yields on the new 8 per
cent Government underwritten mortgages will undoubtedly encourage further
cancellations by holders of FNMA's outstanding purchase commitments for
loans bearing the former 8-1/2 per cent ceiling rate. Even prior to the
rate reduction, when private investors were becoming more active in the
market and mortgage prices were rising, such cancellations had been running
well above the monthly volume experienced during the first half of 1970.

III -12
And with the change in ceilings along with the improvement in market
conditions, it will not be possible for holders of older commitments
to deliver 8 per cent loans at a sufficiently large number of discount
points to produce a yield to FNMA equal to that specified in commit-
ments applicable to 8-1/2 per cent loans.
Life insurance companies. Gross acquisitions of investment
assets by life insurance companies during the third quarter were less
than in the same period of the previous two years, despite an increase
in funds generated from premium and investment income; an unusually
large buildup of cash holdings more than accounted for the shortfall.
Part of the liquid asset buildup reflects preparation for the normal
fourth quarter increase in commitment disbursals, but part may also
reflect a desire to increase liquidity in case policy loan demands
during the fourth quarter are significantly larger than the $437 million
companies had projected. If excess demands do not materialize, the
funds could be quickly invested in marketable securities before year
end.

Both bond and stock markets were buoyed by the November cuts
in the discount and prime rates. These developments reinforced the
expectation that the 1971 new issue volume will be curtailed by a
reduction in the corporate demand for funds and by increased avail-
ability of bank credit, including term loans. In this atmosphere,
both dealers and investors were extremely aggressive buyers of bonds as

III -16
the view gained currency that interest rates would continue to decline
in the weeks ahead despite the current high pace of new issues. The
November public bond total was only marginally below the May peak, which
had included a $1.5 billion debt offering by AT&T. New stock issues
are estimated to have been about $800 million in November, and although
takedowns of private placements apparently remained at low levels, total
corporate securities offerings last month amounted to over $4 billion,
a record high.

Government securities market. Interest rates over the
maturity range of the Treasury yield have moved markedly lower since
the time of the mid-November Committee meeting, along with drops in
both the discount rate and the commercial bank prime rate. For
Treasury coupon issues, the declines have ranged from 45 to as much
as 70 basis points with the largest declines coming in the 3-5 year
maturity area. Bill rates have also declined notably, although like
yields on coupon issues they have rebounded from the lows reached just
prior to Thanksgiving. Most recently bill rates were generally 30 to
45 basis points below mid-November levels with the key 3-month issue
bid at 4.92 per cent, a decline of 30 basis points from its November
17 close.

In the bill market, demand has been quite firm, with the
interest by banks particularly notable as deposit inflows have
continued strong while loan demand has remained weak. In these
circumstances, and with somewhat of a shortage of relatively short-
term bills, the Treasury's auction on November 25 of a $2.1 billion
"strip" of bills was taken in stride by the market.

Despite the sizeable demands for both bills and coupon issues,
dealers' positions in both of these areas have increased since mid-
November. In the case of Treasury bills, the rise has taken place
entirely in the shorter maturities where the bill "strip" was offered.
Note and bond positions have risen by about $150 million from an already
inflated level at the time of the last Committee meeting. This has
occurred despite System purchases of $290 billion of coupon issues in
two market operations. These purchases, in an atmosphere of continuing
weakness in economic activity, heightened for many market participants
the expectation of declines in long-term rates. Thus, in this sector
of the market, dealers have met final investor demands only at fairly
rapidly rising prices as they have sought also to maintain the size of
their positions in the present situation of a rising market with generally
declining financing costs.
New issue volume in the agency market has been very limited
with only two issues of much note: a $750 million FNMA offering,
consisting of a $500 million 3-year portion and a $250 million 6-1/2
year option, and raising $500 million in new funds; and a $350 million
59-month FHLB issue, all of which represented new money. Yields on
these were well below the last comparable issues, but all of them were
accorded very good market receptions. Yields on outstanding agency
issues have moved about in line with those on direct Treasury issues.

III -20
Other short-term credit markets. Preliminary data on commercial
and finance company paper outstandings for November (based on data avail-
able through November 25) show a decline of $1.2 billion to $33.0 billion,
seasonally adjusted. The largest decline--$819 million--was in directly-
placed paper where the usual autumn upsurge in finance company paper out-
standing thus far has failed to materialize, reflecting the General Mo-
tors' strike, weakness in auto sales, and sizeable consumer credit re-
payments. The decline in bank-related commercial paper slowed to $544
million for November from $915 million in the preceding month. These
outstandings now total $3.1 billion, with the cumulative run-off since
mid-August amounting to $4.4 billion.
Declines in short-term rates from November 4 to December 2 were
substantial, ranging from 3/10 to 1-3/8 percentage points. In the week
ending December 2, there were some signs of a rebound in several rates--
certificates of deposit in all maturities, Treasury bills and one year
prime municipal notes. This reversal proved to be temporary, however,
as Treasury bill rates in all maturities are again leading downward,
As a result, from December 2 to December 7 there was some widening of
spreads between commercial paper rates and Treasury bill yields from
65 to 110 basis points on one-month maturities and from 103 to 121 basis
points on three-month maturities. These spreads are somewhat narrower
than on November 4, and considerably narrower than in recent months.

Federal Finance. The latest information indicates that
Federal expenditures in 1971 are likely to be larger than was assumed
in the Chart Show and in the preceding Greenbook. The staff now
projects NIA expenditures of $214.7 billion for fiscal 1971 and $224.0
billion for calendar 1971. These figures are $1.2 billion and $3
billion higher, respectively, than our previous estimates. The major
portion of this revision is in transfer payments; prior estimates do
not appear to have allowed adequately for the rising trend in program
costs and unemployment.
The expenditure estimates are still rather uncertain. There
is the unsettled social security legislation; our projections include
an increase of $3.9 billion annual rate in payments--an amount inter-
mediate between the Senate and House proposals. There is the possibil-
ity (not allowed for in the estimates) of substantially increased
grants-in-aid or revenue sharing programs; these, however, are not
likely to be implemented for a while. There is still uncertainty in
the estimates of defense spending. The full House and the Senate
Appropriations Committee have both passed versions of the defense
appropriations bill that are significantly below Administration requests,
but there is considerable pressure by defense spokesmen for higher
spending on the grounds of both defense needs and the stimulative effect
of outlays in the hard-hit defense-related fields. There is also some
uncertainty with respect to the quarterly impact of the Federal pay
raise.
On the receipts side, the staff is projecting NIA actual
receipts of $200.5 billion for fiscal 1971 and $208.6 billion for the

III -24
calendar year, somewhat higher than previously estimated due to higher
income assumptions. On a unified budget basis, these estimates yield
an expected budget deficit of $15.5 billion for fiscal 1971, and $18.2
billion for calendar 1971. The unified budget deficit for calendar
1970 is estimated to be $12.1 billion.
The table below presents the projected annual growth rates
in NIA Federal spending for the three half-years beginning with the
second half of calendar 1970. As shown in the table, growth rates for
spending are still smaller than the corresponding growth rates for
"high employment" receipts (reflecting surtax repeal, tax reform,
social security tax hikes, and normal growth). At high employment
levels, receipts would slightly exceed expenditures in the projected
period; the quite moderate-sized ($1.2 billion) high employment surplus
expected in the current quarter will increase in calendar 1971.

The Treasury's cash balances have been running somewhat higher
than anticipated, partly as a result of short-term foreign official
capital inflows going into special Treasury issues. Treasury financing
operations in December have been partially completed through the bill
strip financing. Only a moderate amount of additional cash will be
raised during the remainder of the month through increases in the regu-
lar offerings of bill issues, amounting to $100 million each in the
weekly 3-month and 6-month issues and a $200 million increase in the
1-year issue. The cash balance for the last day of December is estimated
to be about $7.7 billion. No further Treasury financing operations are
expected before the February refunding, and no net new money is expected
to be needed before late February.

THE ECONOMIC PICTURE IN DETAIL
International Developments
Foreign exchange markets. The predominant influence on
exchange market developments since mid-November has been the wide
movements in interest rates in the Euro-dollar market and some
national money markets. Major foreign currencies advanced from the
beginning of the period until just before the Thanksgiving holiday
as Euro-dollar rates continued to decline. Approaching month-end,
Euro-dollar rates firmed strongly and spot exchange rates eased. In
the second week of December, the movements in rates were again reversed,
with Euro-dollar interest rates easing and foreign exchange rates
firming.
The German mark was the center of exchange market activity
in this period. The Bundesbank's change in reserve requirements,
accompanying the cut in its lending rates on November 17, occasioned
a massive inflow into marks during the next several days as German
banks viewed the net impact of the policy changes as tending to tighten
their liquidity positions. The result was the opposite of what the
banks expected -- the Bundesbank purchased $1.1 billion from November 17-24
in holding the DM at its ceiling rate in the exchange market, and German
banks found themselves with large excess reserves. On December 2, the
Bundesbank again lowered its discount and Lombard rates to slow the

IV -2
inflow. Euro-dollar rates had risen in the interval, and as German call
money rates dropped, the banks turned to the Euro-dollar market to
employ their excess reserves. The mark price of dollars rose sharply,
inducing some covering of short dollar positions, which further
increased the price of dollars. The exchange rate touched parity at
one point on December 4, and the Bundesbank sold a small amount of
dollars. Euro-dollar interest rates eased subsequently, however, and
the mark turned firmer in the exchange markets.
Other continental currencies also tended to move inversely
to Euro-dollar rates, reflecting interest arbitrage out of and into
that market. The National Bank of Belgium purchased some $60 million
in the last half of November and early December. The System drew an
additional $70 million on the swap line with the Belgians during the
period, raising outstanding drawings on that line to $320 million.
The Bank of France purchased around $110 million during the second
and third weeks of November, but has not made significant purchases
since that time.
Dutch money market conditions were easier in the period
under review than previously, and the guilder exchange rate dropped
substantially in the first week of December as Euro-dollar rates
rose. Officials of the Netherlands Bank indicated that they expected
the Dutch money markets to remain amply liquid through January.

IV -3
Italy's reserve gains, which had been quite large from
mid-August to early November, slowed markedly later in the month,
and the Bank of Italy sold dollars on balance in the latter half
of November. The Swiss money market tightened in November and the
Swiss franc firmed steadily till month-end. The BNS began doing
over-year-end swaps with Swiss banks in early December, causing the
exchange rate to ease somewhat.
Sterling moved in a narrow range throughout the period,
showing strength in mid-November with the release of good October
trade figures, which apparently bolstered confidence in sterling
sufficiently to induce short-term uncovered inflows into sterling
from the Euro-dollar market. Britain's published reserves showed
an increase of $65 million in November after substantial debt
repayments, including the final $125 million of the September drawing
on the System.
The Canadian dollar market was quite active, but the
exchange rate moved relatively little. The Bank of Canada was in
the market only two days in the period and only for nominal amounts.
Euro-dollar market. Until the last few days of November
Euro-dollar rates eased about in line with declines in U.S. money
market rates, but lagged behind them. On average, in the period
November 1-25, the excess of Euro-dollar rates over the cost of
domestic funds to U.S. banks changed little from October.

p/ Preliminary.
Just before the end of November, very short-term U.S. rates
firmed moderately and Euro-dollar rates began rising rather markedly.
In part this advance in Euro-dollar rates reflected normal month-end
tightening and the approach of the year-end (when seasonal pressures
are particularly heavy). The rate increases carried over into the
first few days of December, apparently under the influence of the
Board's announcement (late on November 30) of amendments to Euro-dollar
reserve requirements. Call deposits reached 7-1/4 per cent on December 2,
but have since eased -- averaging 6-3/4 per cent in the week ended
December 8. The three-month Euro-dollar rate went as high as 7-1/2 per cent

IV -5
in the first week of December and has averaged around 7-1/4 per cent
in recent days.
Gross liabilities of U.S. banks to their foreign branches
(including domestic loan participations) declined by about $850 million
in the four weeks ended November 25, to total $8.8 billion -- a decline
of about $1.7 billion from average liabilities in the five Wednesdays
in September. In the following week liabilities declined $190 million.
Partial daily data indicate that this Wednesday-to-Wednesday decline
was the net result of a $0.6 billion reduction to November 30 and a
sharp increase on December 1 and 2, despite rising cost differentials.
Partial-daily data show a further increase (about $475 million) in U.S.
bank Euro-dollar takings through Monday, December 7. Since these borrowings
often fall sharply at month-ends and subsequently rise again, the
recent changes do not give a clear indication of the banks' reaction
to the amendment of regulations.
In the reserve computation period ended November 25, four
New York City banks gave up a total of $520 million of their reserve-
free historical bases. Although data are not yet available for banks
outside of New York, estimates of their positions based on partial
data suggest no substantial change by banks using an historical
reserve-free base, while those using a three per cent of deposits base
apparently repaid less than $100 million.

IV -6
Seasonal influences may be expected to keep Euro-dollar
rates relatively firm until some time in January, although normal
upward pressures on rates may be tempered by the recent easing in
German and Dutch money markets. (See p. IV -2) Canadian interest
rateshave continued to decline at a fairly rapid rate and Canadian
banks are reported to be placing funds in the Euro-dollar market.
The Swiss National Bank reportedly expects to do between $700 million
and $800 million of swaps for the Swiss banks before the year-end;
it will place the dollar proceeds of these swaps in the Euro-dollar
market.
U.S. balance of payments. The liquidity deficit in October
(seasonally adjusted and before special transactions) was quite small
despite the poor showing of merchandise trade (described below).
Weekly data suggest that the deficit in November was somewhat larger
but as the yearend approaches the balances move too irregularly to be
representative of underlying trends.
In October capital flows connected with transactions in
securities probably resulted in a net inflow. Foreign net purchases
of U.S. corporate stocks were about $160 million -- down from the peak
$225 million of September, but still showing a sustained interest in
the relatively strong U.S. market. There was also a sizable amount of
corporate debt issues abroad -- roughly $100 million. However, U.S.
corporations seem to be relying this year on borrowing from foreign

IV -7
banks to finance their foreign operations -- presumably shortening
the maturity of their debt in the process.
Outflows of U.S. capital to purchase foreign securities in
October were a high for the year at $200 million. U.S. purchases of
foreign stocks rose sharply to $50 million, and purchases of foreign
bonds totaled $140 million, mainly for bonds of the Inter-American
Development Bank. The Bank placed most of the proceeds in U.S. long-
term time deposits. The calendar of foreign new bond issues is small
for the rest of this year.
U.S. bank-reported claims on foreigners increased by $150
million in October, following a larger outflow of $270 million in
September. About $200 million of the September-October outflow was
subject to VFCR ceilings. Bankers' acceptances in October were at a
record level, and showed the largest monthly increase in the history
of the acceptance market, reflecting trade financing as well as general
credit facilities.
The deficit on the official settlements basis was about
$800 million in October (not seasonally adjusted). The preliminary
indication is that the November deficit may be close to $2 billion.
While liabilities to foreign branches of U.S. banks fell by about
the same amount in both months -- nearly $1 billion -- liabilities to
other commercial banks increased by $1/2 billion in October and then
appear to have decreased by a like amount in November. This swing in
liabilities to other commercial banks partly reflects a seasonal

IV -8
movement of funds between U.S. agencies of Canadian banks and their
home offices, but is considerably larger than usual.
In November, liabilities to foreign official reserve holders
may have risen by $1-3/4 billion, most of it going to Germany. This
compares with total increases of $350 million in October (also largely
for German account) and $1.8 billion in the third quarter ($2.1 billion
for Germany). U.S. reserve assets in November fell by $200 million --
mainly reflecting U.K. repayments of swap drawings and repurchase of
guaranteed sterling.
Additional data now available on third quarter transactions
confirm that there was a substantial reduction in the outflow of
corporate funds in that period. The gross outflow of funds for direct
investment abroad fell by 40 per cent, or nearly $700 million, from
the second to the third quarter. Net corporate outlays, however, fell
by only one-half that amount as U.S. firms reduced their borrowing
abroad while increasing their accounts receivable from foreign concerns
other than direct-investment affiliates.
The balance on goods and services changed very little. There
was a moderate increase in investment income as income payments fell
and gross receipts rose, but this was offset by some reduction in the
trade balance. Much of the quarter-to-quarter improvement -- nearly
$500 million -- stemmed from the resumption of foreign net purchases
of U.S. corporate stocks. Another important factor was an inflow of

quarter. Errors and omissions, presumably largely unidentified

U.S. foreign trade. The export surplus in October on
the balance-of-payments basis was at a seasonally adjusted annual
rate of $1.0 billion -- slightly less than the already low $1.3
billion rate of September.1/ In the four months of July-October,
the surplus was at an annual rate of $2.5 billion, almost $1 billion
below the second-quarter level.
The July-October surplus was smaller than had been anti-
cipated earlier as a result of a strong upward surge in imports,
especially of industrial materials. Imports reached successive record
highs in September and October. Exports, after peaking in June, dipped
in the third quarter but turned up again in October.2/ In the four
months of July through October exports were at about the same annual
rate as in the second quarter, while imports exceeded the second-
quarter rate by about $1 billion, or 2.5 per cent.
1/ The September balance has been revised downward because that
month's imports were raised to include about $58 million of automotive
products from Canada, which were omitted in the September statistics as
first published.
2/ Newspaper reports of a substantial export surplus in October referred
to exports on the Census basis, including military sales which were
unusually large in that month. On the balance of payments basis, military
sales are excluded from merchandise exports.

IV -11
In the July-October period, exports were at a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of $42.8 billion, on the balance-of-payments
basis. A large increase from the already high second quarter level
occurred in agricultural exports -- especially soybeans, wheat, corn,
and grain sorghums -- with particularly large shipments in October.
Higher export prices for animal feeds, reflecting short foreign supplies
and strong growth in foreign demand, have contributed to the increased
value of agricultural shipments. The advances in animal feed exports
in July-October over the second quarter level more than offset declines
in exports of rice, hides and skins, unmanufactured tobacco, and cotton.
Exports of nonagricultural products averaged a little lower
in the July-October period than in the second quarter. There was a large
cutback in exports of commercial aircraft in August and September;
in October, as had been scheduled, aircraft exports picked up sharply
once more. Other exports that were lower in July-October than in the
second quarter included passenger cars to Canada -- reflecting the
impact of the GM strike -- and industrial supplies such as steel,
aluminum, and chemicals. Steel exports have fallen back to the pre-boom
levels of the first half of 1969. Exports of machinery and passenger
cars to countries other than Canada were up further in July-October.
The U.S. share of world exports of manufactured goods fell in
the third quarter of this year, continuing the persistent downward
trend since 1968. The shares of West Germany and Italy, in contrast,
have risen in each quarter of this year; the share of Japan has been
virtually unchanged.

IV -12
Imports in July-October were at a seasonally adjusted annual
rate of $40.3 billion, on the balance-of-payments basis. Total imports
rose steadily during the four-month period, with large increases over
the second quarter rate occurring in certain industrial supplies and
in machinery.
Steel imports were significantly above second quarter levels,
despite the slackening in domestic steel production in September and
October. A marked easing of steel supply and demand conditions abroad
has made foreign steel readily available at attractive prices. Further
increases in imports are expected in the remaining months of 1970 as
foreign producers attempt to exhaust their voluntary quota allowances
in anticipation of the possibility that the quotas will become
mandatory.
Imports of textile yarns and fabrics in July-October were
noticeably higher than in the previous three months. This increase
may have been in reaction to the discussion of the Trade Bill, but
imports of finished apparel and footwear -- also specified in the
Bill -- did not show a similar rise. Total imports of fuels and
lubricants were almost unchanged from the second quarter, as increases
in fuel oil imports were offset by declines in crude oil imports,
the latter caused by production and delivery problems.
Despite the shutdown of Canadian GM plants, imports of
trucks and parts from Canada rose sharply in September and October.

IV -13
Ford and Chrysler production in Canada did not increase sufficiently
to compensate for the loss in GM production, and it may be that all
three producers drew down their inventories in Canada. Automotive
imports from Europe and Japan also showed strong increases in
September-October, as domestic sales of these cars remained high.
By areas, total imports from the Common Market countries and
Japan were higher in July-October than in the second quarter while
imports from the U.K. and Canada were down. Purchases from the
developing countries as a whole were virtually unchanged.

IV -14
Outlook for merchandise imports of the major foreign
industrial countries. Recent cyclical developments in a number of
industrial countries indicate a slowing in the rate of advance of
economic activity. From the beginning of this year through September,
industrial production has failed to advance or has increased only
slightly in Canada, France, Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom.
In Japan, too, industrial production has been virtually flat since
June.
What effect will current and prospective cyclical developments
have on the imports of these six countries in the period ahead? And,
in particular, are changes in total imports of these countries likely to
affect their imports from the United States? As a step toward answering
these questions, it was found useful to examine the composition of
imports of this group of industrial countries, as well as some indicators
of behavioral relationships between imports and economic activity in
these countries. This examination suggests that from the second half
of 1970 to the first half of 1971, the rate of increase in the value of
imports of the six major industrial countries will be somewhat lower
than the rate experienced from the first half of 1970 to the second half.
The analysis further suggests that imports from the United States into
the four European countries will grow more slowly than in 1970. The
prospects for U.S. exports seem more favorable in Canada, Growth in
U.S. sales to Japan, though possibly slowing, should continue to be
strong.

IV -15
Recent import developments in foreign industrial countries.
Despite the general leveling-off in industrial production this year,
imports in the third quarter continued to rise strongly in France,
Italy, and Japan. Canadian imports, which had leveled off in the first
half of the year, picked up in the third quarter. British imports were
depressed in July by a dock strike, but attained a new high level in
the following three months. Only in Germany was the moderation in
growth of the country's industrial output clearly associated with a
sharp slowing of import expansion, and this slowing was confined--
during the third quarter at least--to imports of materials, while
imports of final products continued to rise strongly.

Total import data for October are now available for Britain,
Japan, and France, and in the first two cases show no significant
departure from the trends described above, French imports, however,
were off somewhat in October, and on average in September-October they
were no higher than in the preceding two months.
During the first nine months of 1970 the value of imports
into several of the major industrial countries totaled more than 20
per cent greater than in the corresponding period last year, continuing
the trends that had been evident in Europe since early in 1968. A
larger part of these increases in value, however, stemmed from price
advances, while volume increases were smaller than before. In contrast
to developments elsewhere, British and French imports, despite rapid
increases since early this year, showed 9-month totals only moderately
higher than a year earlier, because in both countries import growth
between the two halves of 1969 had been slow. This slow growth during
1969 reflected, in France, a reaction to a sharp increase before the
devaluation of the franc, and in Britain, the very slow growth of
domestic economic activity during 1969. In Canada, too, total imports
in the first 9 months of 1970 were only a little higher than a year
earlier, reflecting Canada's success in restraining excess demand.
Imports and economic activity. In order to examine the
response of imports to the levels of economic activity expected in
the major foreign industrial countries in the period immediately

IV -17
ahead, total imports were broken down into five broad categories.1/
The import categories were related to various indicators of economic
activity. Ratios were derived from data covering the period 1964 to
1969-70. The ratios were then applied to forecasts of relevant indi-
cators of economic activity in 1971 as recently revised by the OECD
in the light of national official forecasts. In the derivation of the
estimates for the second half of 1970, this procedure was supplemented,
where possible, by using data of recorded imports for the third quarter
of 1970.
The outlook for imports of the major industrial countries,
derived in this manner, is summarized in the next table. For the six

countries examined here--whose imports account for about two-thirds
of total OECD imports (excluding the United States)--imports are
projected to grow at an annual rate of about 10 per cent from the
second half of 1970 to the first half of 1971. This suggests some
slowing of the expansion of imports of these countries compared to
the past three years.
These estimates are not precise, but their general orders
of magnitude can be accepted with some confidence. The analysis
looks only six months ahead; for certain classes of imports the
flow of deliveries in so short a period is much affected by the
demand and supply conditions which existed in past months. Thus,
a moderation of private investment demand, such as is currently emerging
for some European countries, is not likely to be reflected fully in
imports until sometime in late 1971.
In Germany, there are noticeable cyclical patterns in the
behavioral relationships between imports and economic activity. Total
imports as a percentage of GNP, imports of consumer goods as a percentage
of personal disposable income, and imports of capital equipment as a
percentage of gross fixed investment all vary pro-cyclically; however,
the time lags within which cyclical effects are registered vary con-
siderably among categories. Imports of semi-manufactured goods as a per-
centage of GNP (less food and services) also move with economic activity, but

IV -19
the pattern of the raw material import ratio is just the reverse. This
pattern of raw material imports seems to suggest a shift in boom periods
from importing unprocessed materials to importing materials embodying
a somewhat higher degree of processing.
Superimposed on this cyclical pattern have been secular trends--
most notably the strong upward trend of the share of capital equipment
imports in total imports. Imports of manufactured capital equipment now
represent about one-fifth of total German imports and are second in
importance to semi-manufactured products.
The ratio of total imports to GNP has varied pro-cyclically
within a range of 13 to 16 per cent. The ratio stood at 16 per cent in
the first half of 1970. Given moderation in the rate of growth of German
economic activity, it is reasonable to assume that the ratio will be
somewhat lower in the remainder of 1970 and the first half of 1971.
But the importance of rising demand for capital equipment over the past
year argues for only a very small diminution of the ratio given the
time lags involved in the delivery of capital goods.
The outlook for aggregate economic activity in Germany is
subject to a number of uncertainties. The OECD and official national
forecasters still visualize a continuing significant moderation in
the rate of expansion of activity throughout the first half of 1971.
It is assumed here that business fixed investment expenditure will
remain lower than it was in 1969. Private consumption is expected to
advance only moderately in real terms.

IV -20
Given this outlook and applying the observed relationships
between imports and demand variables, total German imports are projected
to increase very slightly in the first half of 1971 from the level
recorded in the third quarter. This indicates a continuation of the slow
import growth which began in Germany in the second quarter of this year.
In the United Kingdom, semi-manufactured products, raw
materials, and food are the most important categories of imports.
Over the past several years, imports of semi-finished products have
moved up from third place, while imports of food have been declining
in relative importance. Capital goods imports have shown a strong
secular upward trend relative to total imports, a development of
particular importance to the United States. Imports in this category--
of which the U.S. share is about 40 per cent--now represent about
one-sixth of total U.K. imports, whereas they represented less than
one-tenth in 1964. As of 1970, U.K. imports are equivalent to approxi-
mately 15-16 per cent of GNP.
Following a period of virtually no growth in economic activity
in the United Kingdom, a moderate rise in aggregate demand (in real
terms) is expected in the year ahead. Gross fixed investment and govern-
ment current expenditures, both in real terms, may show small year-over-
year advances. Private consumption expenditure is expected to rise
moderately from its current high level.
On the basis of this outlook for U.K. economic activity and
British import propensities, imports into the United Kingdom in the first

IV -21
six months of 1971 are projected to reach an annual rate almost 10 per
cent above the level of imports into the United Kingdom during the first
half of this year. (No valid comparison can be made on the basis of
third quarter data, since these were distorted by the dock strike.)
The commodity composition of French imports has changed
significantly since the mid-1960's. Imports of food and raw materials
have declined in relative importance from one-half to one-third of total
imports, while semi-finished and finished goods have increased from one-
half to two-thirds of the total. Total merchandise imports into France
have averaged about 10 to 12 per cent of GNP in recent years, but this
proportion has risen as a consequence of the franc devaluation.
Expansion in economic activity in France is expected to continue
at a sustained pace in 1971. Private fixed investment expenditure will
remain high, with, perhaps, a slight deceleration in real terms. Private
consumption, however, is forecast to expand at a steady rate.
In line with this outlook for the expansion of economic activity
in France, imports are projected to increase not as rapidly as earlier in
1970, but possibly to a level 7 per cent above imports in the July-October
period.
In Italy, the composition of imports and the relationships
between imports and economic activity are reasonably stable. Imports of
raw materials and semi-finished goods account for almost 60 per cent of
total imports; imports of capital equipment, which account for about

IV -22
one-sixth of total imports, have been increasing strongly in 1969 and
1970. Total Italian merchandise imports are equivalent to about 13 per
cent of GNP.
Economic indicators in Italy point to a vigorous expansion in
economic activity in 1971, following a year of only moderate economic
advance owing to labor unrest during much of 1970. All sectors are
expected to contribute to the more rapid expansion of aggregate demand
in 1971, with private consumer expenditure showing most buoyancy.
Imports into Italy, based on this economic outlook and Italian
import propensities, are projected to rise in the first half of 1971 to
a level about 7 per cent above imports in the third quarter. This would
represent a rate of increase somewhat lower than has been seen so far in
1970.
In Japan the average propensity to import (in relation to GNP)
is about 10 per cent -- lower than in other major industrial countries
except for the United States. Imports of raw materials and semi-processed
goods comprise over two-thirds of total imports. Imports of capital equip-
ment -- almost two-thirds of which come from the United States -- constitute
a relatively small but increasing share of total imports. This rising
share is related to the spectacular growth of Japanese investment.
Some deceleration in the overall rate of expansion of the
Japanese economy is foreseen for 1971, but the growth rate is expected
to continue high. A slowing in the rise of private fixed investment

IV -23
expenditures and of exports in the early part of next year, as well as
a decline in inventory accumulation, are expected to contribute to the
slower pace of advance in aggregate demand. Private consumption expendi-
ture, however, is expected to accelerate through the first half of next
year.
In line with the expected moderation in the rate of expansion
of domestic economic activity, some deceleration in the growth of Japanese
imports is projected for the first six months of 1971. Imports may still
reach a level approximately 8 per cent above the level in the July-October
period.
Merchandise imports into Canada are equivalent to roughly 14
per cent of GNP, with the U.S. share comprising close to three-quarters.
Imports of capital equipment and of semi-processed products are the most
important categories. As noted earlier, automotive imports -- about one-
quarter of total Canadian imports -- have been excluded from this analysis,
since they are, to a large extent, a function of U.S. automotive demand
rather than economic activity in Canada. Imports of capital equipment as
a percentage of gross fixed investment have seen quite a strong secular
upward trend, contributing to the rising share of total imports in this
category. The share of consumer goods in total imports has also shown
a secular rise, even though imports of such goods, as a percentage of
personal disposable income, have been declining in recent years.
Canada experienced a slight improvement in economic activity
in the third quarter of this year, following policy-induced slow growth

IV -24
in the first half of 1970. Continued expansion in aggregate demand is
foreseen in the year ahead. Inventory replenishment and a renewed
expansion in private consumption and private fixed investment expendi-
tures are expected to contribute to more buoyant economic activity.
On the basis of this expected improvement in Canadian economic
activity in the year ahead and Canadian import propensities, imports
into Canada -- excluding automotive imports -- are projected to increase
in the first half of 1971 to a level more than 10 per cent above the
third-quarter level.
The projection of Canadian imports is subject to a major
qualification. Possible effects of the floating Canadian dollar on the
relationships of imports (valued in Canadian dollars) to the domestic
demand variables have not been taken into account.
Implications for imports from the United States. The six
countries examined here accounted for 50 per cent of total U.S.
exports in the first nine months of 1970. On the basis of the
trend of the U.S. share of imports by each country, broken down
into major import categories, imports from the United States by
the four European countries are projected to advance more slowly in
the first half of 1971 than in 1970. Imports from the United States
into Canada and Japan -- where U.S. market shares are especially high --
are projected to increase more strongly than imports into the four
European countries. This results from the projection of a higher rate
of import expansion in these two countries than in the European countries.
However, since Canadian economic activity depends so much on U.S. develop-
ments, any prolonged weakness in the U.S. economy will tend to inhibit the
Canadian recovery and reduce the growth of Canadian imports.

APPENDIX A: STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT BORROWING
ANTICIPATIONS AND REALIZATIONS: THIRD QUARTER 1970*
Preliminary results of the FRB-Census1/ survey of long-term
borrowing anticipations and realizations of State and local governments
for the third calendar quarter of 1970 indicate that these units suffered
a gross long-term borrowing shortfall of over $2 billion--approximately
40 per cent of the more than $5 billion of borrowings planned as of
mid-1970. This gross shortfall was partly offset by about $300 million
of borrowing by some units beyond the amount they had planned. An
additional $650 million of borrowing was accomplished by those units 2/
that refused to cooperate by providing adequate responses to the surveys.-

extremely significant. The Investment Bankers Association, beginning in

While interest rate ceilings played a less significant role
in borrowing postponements or cancellations than in previous surveys,
they still accounted for 27 per cent of gross shortfalls from planned
borrowing. However, some of the borrowing by nonresponding units may
have been accelerated as the result of the downward movement of interest
rates in the third quarter. Even after adjusting for this, the impact
of monetary policy on borrowing shortfalls is understated by sole
reliance on third quarter postponements or cancellations where the cause
was indicated to be interest rates. A considerable number of units
stated that construction projects that had previously been postponed
because of inability to obtain financing could not be reinstated as
rapidly as had been planned at mid-year. Indeed, 31 per cent of
borrowing shortfalls--the single largest reason for long-term borrowing
postponements and cancellations--occurred because of such timing delays
in the underlying project. In many jurisdictions, units are not permitted
to borrow beyond a stated minimum period prior to the need for funds and
in other areas borrowing was voluntarily postponed because of physical
reinstatement lags.
Long-term borrowing shortfalls occassional by interest rate
movement produced only $55 million of capital outlay cutbacks in the
third quarter, although almost $700 million of projects that had been
planned could not begin because of the aforementioned delays in the
reinitiation of projects, and these delays largely reflected the impact
of high interest rates in the previous quarters. Other problems
accounted for about $200 million of capital outlay reductions.
The survey suggested that--as of September 30--State and local
governments had sharply increased their borrowing anticipations for the
current quarter and first quarter of 1971. Some of this increase in
borrowing anticipations reflects postponements of third quarter borrowing
because of the inability of units to reinitiate previously postponed
projects. In addition, the downward trend of interest rates once again
makes feasible much of the borrowing that had been postponed throughout
the period of high interest rates in 1969-70. Actual borrowing in the

units falling within the sample frame. In this way the borrowing of
nonresponding sample units is now included in the survey results and
special efforts are made to elicit information about such borrowing
from nonrespondents. In most cases such units had not provided
information on their planned borrowing in earlier surveys and hence
were not included in the anticipations totals. Despite efforts to
contact nonrespondents by telephone, the Census Bureau was not able
to obtain adequate responses from units that, on a universe basis,
accounted for an unusually large $650 million of borrowing during the
third quarter.

last half of 1970 already has risen to a level almost one-fifth above
the pace of the first half, in large part because of declining interest
rates. And the survey results, as well as the trend of interest rates,
suggest that actual borrowing should mount further in 1971.
The discussion and tables below provide further details
regarding the survey results for the third quarter of 1970.
DEVIATIONS FROM PLANNED BORROWING
Table 2 provides details on the reasons for the $2.17 billion
of gross borrowing shortfalls in the third quarter of 1970. As suggested
above, the largest single reason for shortfalls--particularly at the
State and city level--involved timing problems associated with delays
in reinitiation of previously postponed projects. Interest rates ranked
second, particularly for school districts whose limited tax base reduces
their ability to carry high cost financial obligations. Administrative
or legal delays--including inability to obtain authorization to borrow--
accounted for almost one-fifth of gross shortfalls. Such shortfalls
are often associated with the general financial sequeeze now character-
istic of local governmental units. These three factors combined
accounted for almost 80 per cent of all gross borrowing shortfalls.
Table 3 provides more detail on gross borrowing shortfalls
caused by interest rates. As indicated, the then current cost of
financing and the outlook for lower interest rates were the major causes
of such borrowing postponements and cancellations. Noteworthy was the
relatively slight effect of constitutionally or legislatively imposed
interest rate ceilings, which had been generally raised or abolished by
State legislatures over the last year or so. As in previous surveys,
interest rate impacts in total were largest for school districts which
reported shortfalls of over $200 million, or over 35 per cent of total
interest rate displacements.
Offsetting the $2.17 billion of gross long-term borrowing
shortfalls was about $.9 billion of borrowing above expectations, as
shown in Table 4. Most of this reflected borrowing by nonresponding
survey units; some of their borrowing might have been planned but it
could not be included in the survey anticipations because of their
nonresponse. Although only $55 million of borrowing above anticipations

of the $650 million of unexplained borrowing could also have been
produced by declining rates. It should be noted, however, that while

EFFECTS OF SHORTFALLS
As indicated in Table 5, over one-half of gross long-tern
borrowing shortfalls had no effect on capital expenditures (upper
panel). About one-fourth of total shortfalls in long-term borrowing
was offset by short-term borrowing and reduction in liquid assets.
And almost one-third was associated with changes in plans of a

miscellaneous nature, especially in counties and cities. Such changes
may reflect revisions in expenditure plans--and hence the need for
financing--due to general tax difficulties.
The major capital outlay impacts associated with long-term
borrowing shortfalls--shown in the lower panel of Table 5--occurred not
because of interest rates, but rather because of the difficulties of
reinitiating delayed projects, mainly in States, cities, and school
districts. One of the more dramatic findings of the survey was that
only $55 million of capital outlay reductions occurred because of
interest rates. This very small impact underlines the greater ease
of financial markets during the third quarter.
CHANGING ANTICIPATIONS OF FUTURE BORROWING
Long-term borrowing anticipations for the current quarter
(October-December) increased $2 billion above the level reported as
of June 30, 1970, an unusually sharp change. State and local government
units planned, as of September 30, long-term borrowing of $6.7 billion
of which $2.3 billion had not yet become authorized. In addition, an
increase of anticipations has been posted for the first quarter of 1971
amounting to $1 billion as is shown in Table 6. The December 30, 1970
survey will up-date these anticipations data.

Table 7 summarizes the increasing trend of recent State and
local borrowing, the moderating impact of monetary policy on postpone-
ments and cancellations of such borrowing, and the resultant smaller
impacts of policy on capital outlays. The declining path of interest
rates, the backlog of financing previously postponed, and the upward
adjustment in respondent expectations, all suggest that borrowing by
State and local governments in the first half of 1971 is likely to
expand to record levels. Reflecting the need to makeup borrowing and
projects previously postponed, capital outlays of State and local
governments can also be expected to accelerate.

APPENDIX B: SURVEY OF BANK LOAN COMMITMENTS*
The 43 major banks that participated in the loan commitment
survey covering the 3-month period ending October 31 indicated that the
volume of takedowns, expirations and cancellations (hereafter referred
to simply as takedowns) during this period fell significantly below
that reported earlier in the year. New commitments also failed to match
the volume of earlier report periods; however, the difference between
new commitments and takedowns widened and the level of unused loan
commitments rose markedly--nearly reaching the peak level prevailing in
October of last year.
More than half of the banks reporting in the survey indicated
that their commitment policies became less restrictive during the current
period and only 2 banks stated that their commitment policies had
tightened. This represents the first time since this survey was in-
troduced in January 1969 that a predominant easing in commitment policies
has occurred. As might be expected the reporting banks attributed
the shift in commitment policy to both decreased loan demand and increased
availability of funds. If deposit inflows continue at their recent strong
pace, some further rise in unused commitments may occur in the coming
months. Eighteen of the respondents indicated that they expect the
volume of takedowns to drop moderately further, while only 6 banks
expect an increase.
New Commitments
As in earlier periods, most new commitments reported were
agreements with commercial and industrial firms. Commitments under
confirmed credit lines accounted for the greatest proportion of the
total C&I commitments. However, while maintaining essentially the same
relative share, the volume of new commitments to C&I firms was sub-
stantially below that extended in the July 31 and April 30 report periods.
The volume of new commitments to nonbank financial institutions also
fell well below that recorded in the July 31 survey when finance companies
were bolstering their credit lines in conjunction with the crunch in the
commercial paper market, but was roughly in line with extensions in
earlier report periods. The volume of new real estate loan commitments
essentially matched that recorded in earlier periods of this year.
Takedowns, expirations and cancellations
Takedowns by commercial and industrial borrowers accounted
for more than 80 per cent of the total recorded during the current
period. While this is a comparatively large share of the total by his-
torical standards, the C&I volume for the current report period was only
half as large as that recorded in the July survey. Takedowns by nonbank
financial institutions accounted for an additional 16 per cent of the
total volume for the current report period with takedowns by real estate
borrowers responsible for the remainder.
