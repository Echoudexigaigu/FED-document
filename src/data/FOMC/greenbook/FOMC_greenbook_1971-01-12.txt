SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK
Nonfinancial
Real GNP apparently declined at an annual rate of around
2-1/2 per cent in the fourth quarter of 1970, reflecting the extended
GM strike. Even in the absence of a strike, however, any increase in
real GNP would have been quite modest.
Industrial production in December is tentatively estimated
to have increased about 2 points, or 1.2 per cent, to a level 6.5 per
cent below the July 1969 high. The December rise resulted from higher
output at GM and related supplying industries, and present schedules
suggest a further recovery in auto and truck output in January. Pro-
duction of defense and business equipment, exclusive of trucks, is
estimated to have declined further in December.
Some indicators have been showing strength not related to
the ending of the strike, such as housing starts and new orders for
capital equipment. Retail sales also are estimated to have risen in
December, even apart from autos, mainly reflecting strength late in
the month. Book value of manufacturers' inventories, however, rose
sharply in both October and November.
In the labor market, manufacturing employment--and presumably
total nonfarm employment--increased sharply, reflecting the return to
work of some 350,000 strikers plus recalls of workers laid off in supply-
ing industries. Although both initial unemployment claims and insured
unemployment apparently declined somewhat in December, they remained

I-2
far above the levels of a year earlier. Seasonal employment gains in
retailing reportedly fell short of usual expectations, however, and it
should be noted that most such temporary employees would not have been
eligible for unemployment compensation.
The GNP price deflator is now estimated to have increased at
an annual rate of 4.8 per cent in the fourth quarter--somewhat faster
than in the third--mainly reflecting a compositional shift away from
autos. Seasonally adjusted prices of industrial commodities at whole-
sale increased moderately in December, while wholesale prices of farm
products and foods declined further. And the rise in the consumer price
index slowed appreciably in November.
Outlook. We are projecting a very large increase in GNP this
quarter--$29 billion--mainly because of the post-strike resurgence in
output at auto plants and related activities. Real GNP is expected to
rise at an annual rate of 7 per cent, faster than indicated in our pre-
ceding projection.
For the fourth and first quarters combined, real growth is
still expected to average only about 2-1/4 per cent, and to continue at
about this rate in the second quarter of 1971. Expansion in real GNP
is projected to pick up only moderately thereafter, to around a 3 per
cent annual rate. A major factor holding down expansion throughout the
year is the relative weakness indicated for business capital outlays.
For the year as a whole, business fixed investment is projected to
remain about unchanged from 1970 in current dollars and to decline
significantly in real terms. Residential building is expected to rise

I- 3
throughout the year, while consumer spending is projected to increase
about in line with disposable income.
Projected growth in real GNP thus falls well short of poten-
tial in 1971, suggesting a continued rise in the unemployment rate and
a manufacturing capacity utilization rate that remains depressed. With
further easing in resource use, we still look for a gradual slowing in
the price deflator to an annual rate of increase of about 3.5 per cent
in the fourth quarter,
Financial
Security yields stopped declining around mid-December and by
early January had risen in some key market sectors by about 25 basis
points. The halt in the rate decline developed as investors balked at
aggressive underwriter pricing of new corporate and municipal bond
offerings, To some extent this resistance reflected a larger than
anticipated December flow of such issues--particularly in the municipal
market. But investors also began to look ahead to a heavy continuing
new issue volume early in 1971, and to the possibility that the Treasury
might combine a sizeable pre-refunding with its large regular February
refinancing. As investors backed off, dealers and underwriters became
a bit restive about their large accumulated inventories.
Despite the back up of market rates, weak loan demands over
the mid-December corporate tax payment date triggered a further reduction
in the bank prime rate. While the ending of the GM strike helped to
moderate the degree of business loan contraction for all of December

I-4
relative to preceding months, the trend of outstanding business loans
(adjusted for loan sales) nevertheless continued down. Another prime
rate cut--to 6-1/2 per cent--was initiated by a medium-sized bank
early in January, but it is not yet clear how other major banks and
financial markets will respond to this lead.
Growth of consumer-type time and savings deposits was
especially rapid in Decmeber. Banks also elected to increase sales of
large CD's, and demand deposits--although falling short of the
targeted path--grew much more rapidly than in earlier months of the
quarter. A sizeable part of these expanded deposit flows was used
to finance the enlarged inventories of dealers and underwriters, a
part went for increased consumer and mortgage loans, and bank reliance
on non-deposit sources of funds was reduced further. However, the bulk
of the large December increase in total bank credit went into new
investments--as in earlier months of the quarter--reportedly in-
cluding an increasing amount of longer-maturity municipal bonds. At
non-bank thrift institutions, December deposit inflows apparently also
remained relatively strong, contributing further to the recent dramatic
improvement of mortgage markets.
Outlook. The new year appears to be starting with a somewhat
larger prospective volume of new security offerings than seemed likely
a month ago. In addition to the possibility of a large, complicated
Treasury pre-refunding and "rights-cash" refinancing (on which terms
would be announced January 20, with books open the following week),

I -5
the January flow of new publicly-offered corporate bonds is now projected
to be only slightly smaller than the large average monthly volume of
the fourth quarter. While corporate bond volume should taper off
somewhat thereafter, underwriters nevertheless expect it to remain
relatively large. Municipal bond volume still seems likely to reach
a new record in the first quarter, as the backlog of previously post-
poned borrowing comes on to the market. But Federally sponsored housing
agencies will not be adding to demand pressures in the first quarter,
since they are scheduled to repay nearly $1 billion of outstanding
debt over the period.
An increase in short-term borrowing demands can be expected
in consequence of the projected first quarter spurt in economic activity.
Part of these demands will very likely fall on banks, which reportedly
have been promoting new loan commitments more aggressively in recent
months. However, much of the expanded financing immediately associated
with the renewal of General Motors production and sales can be ex-
pected to occur through the commercial paper market. Moreover, with
commercial paper rates holding about a percentage point below the
6-3/4 per cent prime rate, active bank participation in business
financing will probably require an across-the-board reduction of the
prime rate from that level.
Unless the money supply grows at a faster rate than in the
quarter just ended, the anticipated near-term increase of short-term
borrowing may constrain further declines of short-term rates in the
period immediately ahead. Short rates will also be affected by

I -6
downward seasonal influences and by whether or not market expectation
of an across-the-board cut in the prime rate and a further drop in the
discount are realized. Long-term rates are likely to decline, on
balance, given the prevailing wide spreads between short-and long-term
rates and continued availability of institutional credit, although
heavy new issue volume and large dealer inventories might be temporary
inhibiting factors.
Balance of Payments
In November, for the fourth month in succession, U.S. foreign
trade results failed to meet expectations. Exports declined in total,
and their October-November average was 5 per cent below the June-July
high. Imports, on the other hand, were above their projected path, and
the two latest months averaged 7 per cent above June-July. Thus, after
briefly reaching a high of $5 billion (annual rate) around midyear
and averaging about a $3 billion rate in the second and third quarters,
the trade surplus fell nearly to zero in October-November.
These developments are difficult to explain simply in terms
of changes in total demand abroad or in this country. It is true
that total industrial production and new domestic orders in major
industrial countries abroad have been pretty flat since last spring
and summer, but this alone would hardly explain so marked a decline
in U.S. exports. And why have U.S. imports risen so much at a time
of slack demand in this country?

I -7
Upward price pressures on goods and services have continued
strong almost everywhere, and it appears that the prices we have been
paying on our imports have risen more than the average prices on our
exports. The pressures on prices abroad can be attributed in large
part to rising unit labor costs. At the same time signs have not been
absent in Europe of continuing pressures from the side of demand. In
Britain, for example, where industrial production has risen since May,
domestic new orders for machinery and equipment have continued to
exceed deliveries. Elsewhere, capital expanditure plans have been
sagging, but consumption continues to grow in real terms. In Germany,
output of finished durable goods (including machinery and autos) rose
in October, recovering a little of the ground lost since the spring.
But the most significant development--from the point of view of U.S.
exports--seems to have been a marked easing of demand for industrial
materials in Europe and Japan.
Analysis of commodity composition suggests that the decline
in total U.S. exports must be attributed in great part to the
disappearance, since last spring, of the abnormally tight demand-and-
supply conditions in foreign markets for many semimanufactured materials,
including steel, which had been favoring U.S. exports in the first half
of 1970. Greater availability of foreign supplies of such materials,
coupled with aggressive selling by foreign producers, also helps to
explain the considerable rise in U.S. imports in recent months. In
addition, the underlying trend of growth in U.S. imports of finished
manufactures was still outweighing cyclical influences on such imports
at least through October.

I -8
Our estimate of net exports of goods and services in the
final quarter of 1970 has now been reduced to $3 billion, annual rate,
In the GNP projection for 1971 we are writing down net exports to
about $4-1/2 billion ($1 billion less than the projection four weeks
ago). Both these figures assume a trade balance in December sub-
stantially above the October-November level of $0.2 billion, annual
rate, and if this does not materialize further revisions will be in
order.
The hoped-for improvement in the over-all balance of payments
in the fourth quarter seems not to have occurred. On preliminary
indications, the adjusted liquidity deficit was about as large as in
the third quarter. Substantial repatriations of corporate funds at the
yearend, a seasonal consequence of the OFDI requirements appear to
have been settled largely through U.S. bank branches abroad, with little
effect on foreign exchange markets. Because of earlier repayments of
U.S. bank liabilities to branches, the official settlements deficit
for the fourth quarter as a whole was extremely large and brought the
total for the year over $10 billion.
Pending a full review of the balance of payments prospects
for 1971, it is safe to say that recent developments make the achieve-
ment of an adjusted liquidity deficit as low as $3 billion in 1971
less likely than it seemed at the time of the November chart show.

THE ECONOMIC PICTURE IN DETAIL
Domestic Nonfinancial Scene
Gross national product. It now appears likely that GNP in
the fourth quarter will increase by $5-1/2 billion, the same as our
Greenbook estimate of last month. However, the implicit GNP deflator
appears to have risen substantially more than indicated earlier and
real GNP is now estimated to have declined by about 2-1/2 per cent,
annual rate. The greater rise in the deflator apparently resulted in
significant part from the sharp decline in auto sales which reduced
their relative importance in GNP and raised the deflator since auto
prices have increased less than the average of goods and services
since the base period. The rebound of auto sales expected in the first
quarter should have the reverse effect and operate to moderate the rise
in the deflator.

Unit auto sales in December remained close to the very low
November seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.0 million. Continued
weakness for the most part apparently resulted from the shortage of
GM cars with the rate of sales picking up late in the month. However,
this does not appear to be the full explanation, since sales of other
makes continued unimpressive. Domestic auto sales now appear likely
to average about 5-1/2 million annual rate for the fourth quarter as
a whole, rather than the 6-1/4 million we had been projecting.
Retail sales, excluding autos, generally picked up in
December, with most of the strength evident in the last pre-Christmas
week. We have also raised our estimate of residential construction
outlays to reflect recent strong increases in housing starts.
On the other hand, net exports weakened further in recent
months. Data for November indicate that imports continued much stronger
than anticipated, and exports dipped sharply for a wide range of
commodities, possibly as a result of a moderating of severe demand
pressures in western Europe and Japan. We have also cut our estimate
of business fixed investment outlays by an additional $1 billion to
reflect a lower rate of auto and truck purchases by business than
estimated formerly.
On balance, final sales in the fourth quarter are now
estimated to have increased by $8-1/2 billion, about $2-1/2 billion less
than we had projected last month. On the other hand, we are now
estimating some fourth quarter inventory accumulation, reflecting both

II -3
the weakness in final demands and substantial increases in the book
value of manufacturers' inventories in October and November. The pro-
jected decline in the rate of inventory investment between the third
and fourth quarter is thus $2-1/2 billion less than we had previously
estimated.

We are now projecting a larger post-strike rise in first
quarter GNP than last time--$29 billion--in part because of the greater-
than-expected strike effects in the fourth quarter. In real terms the
GNP increase amounts to about 7 per cent (annual rate). In addition,
Federal pay raises should add $2.8 billion to personal income somewhat
earlier than had been expected and give further impetus to growth of
consumer outlays this quarter. Moreover, some recovery is projected
in net exports from the depressed fourth quarter level and the recent
strong gains in housing starts and permits appear to assure larger
increases in residential construction outlays in the first quarter than
we had earlier expected.
The projections for the remainder of the year remain essentially
unchanged from the preceding Greenbook. The second quarter GNP increase
is expected to be much smaller following the catch-up in auto and truck
output and sales. We are now projecting an increase of about $15-1/2
billion, excluding any allowance for a build-up of steel inventories as
a hedge against a possible strike August 1. In real terms, GNP is
expected to increase by about 2-1/4 per cent, annual rate, about the
average of the two previous quarters.

We continue to expect moderately larger gains in real GNP
in the second half of 1971. A more favorable financial atmosphere (we
are now assuming 6 per cent growth in money supply in 1971) should be
reflected in continued expansion of residential construction activity
and in a more rapid rate of growth of State and local outlays. Growth
of consumer outlays is expected to expand moderately further in line
with disposable income, but recent surveys suggest little change in
1971 in fixed investment spending.

II -6
Real growth would still fall short of potential, averaging
about 3 per cent in the second half, and we are projecting a continued
increase in unemployment. As before, this projection is based on a
slightly less than "normal" growth in the labor force and relatively
small gains in productivity. Factory utilization rates would also
remain depressed, as industrial production is expected to rise about
in line with expansion of capacity. This further lessening of pressure
on resources should contribute to some moderation in average price
increases, and we continue to expect the rise in the GNP price deflator
to slow gradually to about a 3-1/2 per cent annual rate of increase in
the final quarter of the year.

Industrial production. Industrial production is tentatively
estimated to have increased in December by about 2 points to a level
around 163.5 per cent. At this level the total index would be 6.4 per
cent below the July 1969 high.
With the return of GM to production, the rise in output in
December was centered in the automotive and supplying industries. The
earlier decline in the index resulting from the strike, will be made up
by the end of January with a further possible boost in February, based
on schedules published by Ward's Automotive News. There have been, how-
ever, reports of production cutbacks scheduled for January at Chrysler
and AMC because of high inventories.

Output of consumer durable goods other than autos probably
eased off in December. With factory stocks of consumer hard goods at
a new high at the end of November, and with retail sales of furniture
and appliances showing little change since June, recent production
rates do not seem sustainable. (Last week the Frigidaire Division of
GM announced the second round of layoffs at its plant. This plus a
November 24 cutback in employment amounted to 9 per cent of the
Frigidaire work force.) Output of consumer staples, however, may have
risen slightly in December. Among other sectors, output of business
and defense equipment, excluding trucks, is estimated to have declined
further. Production of materials probably rose because of the increase
in automotive parts and raw steel. However, further cuts in aluminum
production have been announced.
Retail sales. Retail sales are estimated to have increased
about 1-1/2 per cent in December, according to estimates based on the
four weeks ending December 26. Strength was concentrated largely in
the last week, which contained one more pre-Christmas shopping day
this year than last. Unit sales of U.S.-made cars strengthened somewhat
in the last 10 days but for the month remained close to the depressed
November seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5 million. Furniture and
appliance sales increased but were no higher than at mid-year. Nondurable
sales increased about 1 per cent, as all major types of outlet, except
general merchandise, reported higher sales. General merchandising sales
declined more than 1 per cent and were only about 5.6 per cent higher
than a year earlier.

Cyclical indicators. The Census leading indicator composite
rose 1 per cent in November, on a preliminary basis, after declining
.3 per cent in October. (The preliminary October index, calculated a
month ago, had shown an increase of .8 per cent.) The coincident and
lagging composites declined in November. The leading composite has been
fluctuating around a reduced level since last March and has not yet broken
out of the range established over the last nine months.

Manufacturers' orders and shipments. New orders for durable
goods rose 1.9 per cent in November, according to preliminary data,
after declining 4.5 per cent in October. The increase was mainly in
capital equipment and primary metals.
Capital equipment orders rose 7 per cent, the second monthly
increase in a row. On a three-month moving average basis, these orders
are significantly above their second-quarter lows, but have not regained
the high levels of late 1969 and early 1970.
Orders for primary metals rose somewhat from October's reduced
levels, possibly reflecting both anticipation of the end of the GM strike
and the beginning of hedging against possible strikes next year.

Unfilled orders for durable goods increased, reflecting
increases for capital equipment and primary metals. It was only the
second monthly increase in 1970. From November 1969 to October 1970,
the backlog dropped 9 per cent--the biggest decline in this series
since it dropped 16 per cent from November 1959 to March 1961.
Shipments declined in November, mostly at primary metals
and aerospace industries.
Inventories. Book value of manufacturers' inventories rose
at a $6.9 billion annual rate in November. The October rate was
revised upward to $9.7 billion, with all of the revisions at nondurable
goods manufacturers.

In November, durable goods manufacturers continued to
accumulate inventories at around the third-quarter rate. Over the
past two months, over half of the growth in durable goods stocks has
been in materials and in the in-process and finished goods stocks of
primary metals plants. In view of the GM strike and of 1971 labor
negotiations in steel and other primary metals industries, at least
some of the accumulation of materials may have been deliberate.
Durable materials stocks do not appear high relative to shipments after
allowing for the effect of the GM strike on shipments. However, materials
stocks were higher relative to unfilled orders for durable goods except
autos and metals than at any time during the 1964-65 and 1967-68 pre-
contract-expiration buildups of steel.
Over-all inventory-shipments ratios rose in November at
both durable and nondurable goods manufacturers. The durable goods
inventory-backlog ratio, already at a record high, rose only slightly
further.

Auto production exceeded sales in December and auto dealers may
have been able to begin to replenish their stocks; for the fourth quarter
as a whole, however, retail auto stocks probably declined substantially.
Construction and real estate. Seasonally adjusted outlays for
new construction, which were revised downward by 2 per cent for recent
months, rose 1 per cent in December to an annual rate of $92.0 billion,
only slightly below the peak reached in April 1969. While the December
rate exceeded that of a year earlier by 2 per cent, it reflected an 8 per
cent increase in construction costs, as measured by the Census Bureau.
Altogether, current dollar outlays for 1970 totaled $90.5 billion, near
the 1969 level in current dollar terms, but 7 per cent lower after
adjustment for increased costs.

During December, outlays for residential construction-spurred
by the sustained upsurge in housing starts--advanced 3 per cent further
on a current dollar basis. Outlays for private nonresidential construction
changed little at a level 6 per cent below the peak of last March. Public
construction outlays, also were little changed and were about 7 per cent
below the high in February of 1969.
Seasonally adjusted private housing starts continued sharply
upward in November to the highest annual rate--1.69 million units--in
nearly two years. Unlike October, single-family units as well as
multifamily units shared in the increase. Also, starts moved higher
in all regions except the West, where, however, the rate remained above
the relatively advanced level of a year earlier.

which in October--the latest month for which data are available--
were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 423,000, down 1 per
cent from September, and 7 per cent lower than a year earlier.
With building permits in November continuing at the exceptionally
high October rate and mortgage markets generally easing further, starts
in December may have held near the advanced November rate. If so, the
rate in the fourth quarter as a whole would have been almost a third
above the low in the first quarter of the year and moderately above the
recent quarterly peak of 1.64 million units registered in the first
quarter of 1969. Thus, even including the reduced level of starts forced
by tight mortgage market conditions in the early part of 1970, starts for
the entire year may have totaled 1.42 million, only a little short of the
1969 total of 1.46 million units. Moreover, with mobile home shipments
holding at a considerably improved level in recent months, 1970 total
shipments also may have approached the record 413,000 units of 1969.

Anticipated plant and equipment expenditures. Businesses
report plans to increase spending for new plant and equipment by only
1,4 per cent in 1971, according to the December Commerce-SEC survey.
Expenditures of manufacturing industries are projected to decline
nearly 3 per cent with only nonferrous metals and petroleum producers
showing increases over 1970. In nonmanufacturing, anticipated increases
of 19 per cent in electric utilities and 14 per cent in communications
more than offset projected declines in all other sectors; overall
spending by nonmanufacturing industries is expected to increase by about
4 per cent. The results of this survey are similar to the November
McGraw-Hill survey, which showed a 2 per cent increase for 1971.

Taken in conjunction with the Commerce-SEC November survey
covering the first half of 1971, which indicated no change in total
spending from the preceding half year, the current survey implies
virtually no change after mid-year also. On this basis, spending
tends to level off in the second half for both nonmanufacturing firms,
after a rapid increase in 1970, and for manufacturing, following a
moderate decline since the first half of 1970.

Labor market. The resumption of production at General
Motors likely resulted in an increase in nonfarm payroll employment
in December and also appears to have been reflected in a modest decline
in insured unemployment. Insured unemployment is now estimated to have
averaged 2.25 million weekly in December (seasonally adjusted), a decline
of nearly 100,000 from November; the level was still more than a million
higher than a year earlier, however,

Labor force and unemployment. Labor force growth has slowed
somewhat with the sharp rise of unemployment this year. However, the
civilian labor force still increased by 1.9 million over the year ending
in October-November, including about 450,000 added because of reductions
in the Armed Forces. The year-over-year rise in total labor force
estimated for the fourth quarter is about in line with the projected
"normal" increase in the total labor force of about 1.5 million (based
on population increases and long-term trends in labor force participation
rates). Total civilian employment at year-end was only slightly higher
than a year earlier and nearly all the civilian labor force increase
was reflected in a net rise in unemployment.

Some slowing in labor force growth is not unusual in a period
in which demand for labor is slack. Some workers become discouraged by
the lack of job opportunities and either leave or decide not to enter
the work force. Work force participation among women continued to
increase, but at a much slower rate than in other recent years, and
participation rates for males turned down after rising slightly in 1969.
The drop has been especially large among Negroes and probably is a prime
factor in the more moderate rise of Negro jobless rates relative to
white rates in this period compared with earlier periods of slack
activity.
Hourly earnings. Year-to-year increases in average hourly
earnings of production and nonsupervisory workers on private payrolls
moderated slightly further in the fourth quarter, partly because of the
General Motors strike. The sharpest slowing took place in durable goods
manufacturing; nondurable goods manufacturing increases were as rapid as
earlier. In trade, gains in hourly earnings moderated further, following
smaller increases in each of the earlier quarters of 1970. Hourly
earnings increases in contract construction, services, and transportation
show little indication of slowing, reflecting the impact of large wage
settlements in those industries.

Collective bargaining. New wage agreements covering nearly
5 million workers under major contracts in private nonfarm industries
will be negotiated in 1971, marking the second successive year of
peak collective bargaining activity. The largest number of workers
covered by contract settlements in the 1960's was 4.6 million in 1968.
Another 5.3 million workers already covered by multi-year contracts
will receive deferred wage increases. At the beginning of 1971,
3 million workers are covered by cost-of-living clauses providing for
adjustments in wage rates tied to increases in the consumer price
index.
The 1971 bargaining year will be dominated by negotiations
in the basic steel industry, where contracts covering 400,000 workers
expire July 31. A preview of the steel workers demands and manage-
ment's reaction will occur soon as the contract between the metal can
companies and the steel workers union expires on February 14. The
union has indicated it wants a cost-of-living clause, which is not
included in the present contract.
Construction and aluminum contract negotiations will be
concentrated in the first half of the year and major contract negotia-
tions during the year also include telephone and telegraph workers,
aerospace workers, apparel workers (men's clothing), bituminous coal
miners, longshoremen, and rail and airline employees.
Deferred wage increases will average 7.8 per cent this year,
substantially more than the 5.6 per cent average deferred increase
received in 1970. About 2.6 million nonmanufacturing workers are

Wholesale prices. Seasonally adjusted wholesale prices
were virtually unchanged on average between mid-November and mid-
December, following a decline in November. The increase over the
fourth quarter was at an annual rate of only 0.4 per cent, compared
to 3.9 per cent in the third quarter and 2.3 per cent over the past
year. The improved performance of recent months is attributable to
declining prices of farm products, particularly livestock, and to an
unusually large December drop in processed foods, mainly reflecting
lower prices for meat and poultry.

The 2.7 per cent rate of rise in industrial commodity prices
in December followed no change in November and a large rise in October

previous quarter and about the same as over the past year.

the very large increase mainly reflecting the terms of contracts
negotiated in 1970 in the trucking and construction industries. In
manufacturing, the average deferred increase is 4.9 per cent for 2.7
million workers, compared with 4.3 per cent in 1970.

II -27
The continued substantial increase in industrial prices reflects
the obstinacy of inflation in prices of highly fabricated commodities
despite growing price weakness in important materials such as metals.
Consumer goods rose about 2 per cent (according to a preliminary
estimate) in the fourth quarter of 1970, about as much as in the first 3
quarters combined (not at annual rates and not seasonally adjusted). The
rise in 1970 was almost 4 per cent compared to 3 per cent in 1969.
Producers' goods rose 2.2 per cent in the fourth quarter--almost as much
as in the first three quarters--bringing the yearly climb to 4.7 per
cent compared to 4.4 per cent in 1969. The fourth quarter acceleration
in finished goods prices was in part seasonal but proved larger than
had been expected.

The December advance in industrial materials prices exhibited the
same general pattern as in most recent months. Fuels and power were the
leading upward influence in the last two months, while metals continued
weak; in fact, the metals average dropped in both November and December,

II -28
reflecting lower quotations for non-ferrous metals--including copper
and products--and ferrous scrap. Prices of some important building
materials increased in December, although lumber and plywood receded
to the lowest level since mid-1968.
In late November or early December, automobile prices for
major producers were raised slightly further following the GM wage
settlement. Since then, Volkswagen has announced increases.
Since mid-December, lead, lead scrap and zinc prices have
declined further. Aluminum producers have restricted output to rates
well below capacity, and discounts below list are still general. Major
foreign copper exporting countries, faced with an apparent world over-
supply, have been attempting to work out an agreement for output
control. On the other hand, magnesium prices rose this month for the
first time since 1956.

Consumer prices. The rise in consumer prices slowed to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.7 per cent in November, from about
6-1/2 per cent in September and October, as food and gasoline prices
declined.

A more than seasonal drop in meat prices, particularly port,
and a contra-seasonal decline for fruits and vegetables, contributed to
the seasonally adjusted decline in prices of food at home in November.
The increase for non-food commodities was held down by a drop in retail
gasoline prices which followed two months of increases. Apparel,
household durables and new car prices all continued to rise at rates
substantially above those for the first three quarters of the year.

II -30
The rate of increase in new car prices, seasonally adjusted, was almost as
high as in September and October, and reflected in large part the shift
in weights toward the 1971 models. Used car prices also contributed
significantly to the November increase, though not so much as in October.

Among services, medical costs resumed an annual rate of rise of
about 8 per cent after the small October increase which reflected an ad-
justment for previous overestimate of health insurance costs. Rents and
gas and electricity rates continued to rise faster than in the first three
quarters. Higher house prices raised mortgage interest costs in spite of
a slight decline in mortgage rates. (This drop, the largest since June
1967, reflected only conventional mortgage interest rates as the recent
cut in VA and FHA rates will not appear in the index until January.) When
home finance is excluded, the November rise in service costs is still well

Livestock supply prospects. The moderating influence on food
prices exerted by relatively large supplies of livestock products in the
past quarter is expected to continue well into 1971, largely because of
prospects for continuation of large hog marketings. The recent pig crop
survey indicates that hog marketings will stay about a fifth above the
low levels of a year earlier throughout the next five or six months.
The margin above a year earlier is likely to narrow in the summer and
disappear in the fall when marketings may drop below a year earlier.
Beef supplies will probably continue to hold close to the record levels
of 1970.
Feed supplies are less ample than last year and more costly,
largely because of the 10 per cent cut in the corn crop caused by blight
and drought. As the year progresses we can expect livestock producers
to scale down production in response to the very unfavorable livestock-
feed price ratios. Hog producers in the Corn Belt have reported inten-
tions to produce 6 per cent fewer pigs for next fall's markets.
Uncertainties about feed supplies extend beyond the current
feeding year. As for the corn blight, it is not known how well spores
of the blight can overwinter in the Corn Belt nor is it known how much
constraint on 1971 corn acreage may be imposed by the limited supply of
resistant seed available. It is not known what impact the blight has
had on producers' planting plans in areas heavily infested in 1970.
The new farm legislation introduces another uncertainty since it gives
producers more leeway than formerly in choosing crops they will plant
once they have complied with prescribed "set-asides". Under the pre-
liminary 1971 feed grain "set-aside", less acreage is likely to be idled

II -32
than in 1970. The released land will probably be used for sharply
expanded plantings of soybeans and other crops as well as feed crops.
Dr. Don Paarlberg, Director of Agricultural Economics in the
USDA, recently stated that corn production possibilities in 1971 range
from a low crop of 3.7 billion bushels under conditions of low acreage,
bad weather, and severe blight, up to a high of 5.2 billion bushels
under conditions of high acreage, good weather, and minimal blight.
The USDA hoped-for production is 4.8 billion bushels, an increase of
.7 billion bushels over the 1970 crop. If realized, this output would
be sufficient to meet livestock feeding and export demands at reasonable
prices and permit a small rebuilding of stocks.

THE ECONOMIC PICTURE IN DETAIL
Domestic Financial Situation
Bank credit. Commercial bank credit, adjusted for transfers
of loans between banks and their affiliates, increased at an annual rate
of nearly 10 per cent in December. This increase followed a somewhat
smaller rise in November and a moderate decline in October. For the
three months combined, bank credit rose at a 5.3 per cent annual rate,
decidedly below the rate for the third quarter and only slightly more
than that recorded during the first half of the year.
In December, as in other recent months, banks added substan-
tially to their investment portfolios. Holdings of "other securities"
(mainly state and local and Federal Agency issues) increased $1.9
billion, only a little less than the sizable average monthly gains from
September through November. Growth in U.S. Treasury securities was
larger in December than in November as banks participated actively in
the December 2 sale of strip bills and retained a large portion of these
securities at month end. The Treasury also increased by $200 million
the volume of bills sold in the regular weekly auctions and this also
may have tended to promote the growth in bank holdings of these secur-
ities. The increase in holdings of Treasury and other securities in
December amounted to $2.6 billion, which brought the increase in bank
investment holdings of securities for the fourth quarter to $5.9 billion
and for the second half of the year to $13.2 billion.

III -2
The pace of increase in total loans (adjusted for loan trans-
fers) picked up slightly in December from November's modest rate. The
advances during these two months, however, were not enough to offset the
fairly sharp decline in October so that in the fourth quarter as a whole
total loans (adjusted for transfers) dropped slightly in contrast with
the sharp rise recorded in the third quarter.
The improvement in the loan picture in December was primarily
due to a sharp advance in loans to security dealers--who used these
loan funds to finance a buildup in inventories. Growth in real estate
loans also strengthened moderately. The rapid rate of decline in busi-
ness loans (adjusted for transfers) moderated somewhat, but still
remained sizable.
Resumption of auto production at General Motors and some
pickup in general business activity may have served to slow the decline
in business loans. However, loan demands around the mid-month tax and
dividend paying dates and the following week continued to be quite
weak, and the prime rate was lowered by another quarter of one per cent.
A further one quarter point decline to 6-1/2 per cent was posted by a
few banks this week, but the reduction at this writing had not spread
to the major city institutions.

Monetary aggregates. The rate of advance in the narrow money
stock (M) rose markedly in December, although apparently by somewhat
less than expected a month ago. Private demand deposits rose sharply
after two months of slow growth and currency holdings continued to
increase at the strong pace of the previous two months. The December
increase at an annual rate of almost 8 per cent (based on preliminary
data) raised the fourth quarter growth rate of M1 to nearly a 4 per
cent annual rate. An.alternative monetary measure (M2), which includes
time deposits at commercial banks other than large CD's, increased at
a 13.3 per cent annual rate in December. This is also a much faster
rate of advance than in preceding months of the fourth quarter and
reflects both a pickup in the growth rate of the time deposit component
and the faster increase in the M1 component. Over the fourth quarter,
M2rose at an annual rate of 9.4 per cent.

III -4
The December increase in total time and savings deposits at
commercial banks was at an annual rate of 28.3 per cent, nearly double
the November rate. A sharp step up in CD sales was partly responsible,
with most of the improvement occurring at New York banks. At least
some of these sales were reportedly undertaken to bolster year-end
balance sheet magnitudes. The gain in other time deposits reflected a
marked growth in State and local deposits that more than offset a
further decline in deposit balances of foreign official institutions.
Reflecting accelerated growth in demand and time deposits,
as well as a sharp rise in Treasury balances, the rate of growth in the
adjusted bank credit proxy also increased markedly during December,
rising at a 15 per cent annual rate, or almost twice as fast as in
November. In addition to financing a substantial growth in assets,
banks continued to use a significant portion of their incoming deposit
funds to reduce nondeposit liabilities.

Nonbank depositary intermediaries. The relatively strong
recent growth in deposits at nonbank thrift institutions apparently
continued during December,1/ when yields on short-term Government secur-
ities dropped below comparable-maturity deposit interest rate ceilings
for the first time since 1967. This enhanced attractiveness of thrift
institution claims was manifest also in the exceptionally stable grace-
period deposit pattern at large New York mutual savings banks, where

Liquid asset holdings of nonbank institutions have increased
significantly since early this summer, partly resulting from the
inability of the institutions to acquire mortgages as rapidly as funds
became available. Liquid asset ratios at mutual savings banks and S&L's
show a strong uptrend in liquidity. The growth in liquid assets should
moderate, however, as increased mortgage takedowns develop in early
1971. Moreover, S&L's may be accumulating some liquidity now in order
to repay part of their one-year subsidized advances maturing in the
Spring, despite FHLB efforts to extend such borrowing.

Mortgage market. As a result of the high level of savings
inflows to the thrift institutions in recent months, residential mortgage

III -8
funds now appear to be in relatively ample supply. Seasonally adjusted
outstanding mortgage commitments at these institutions were at a 16-
month high in November, and recent FNMA field reports and FHA field
office surveys confirm the marked improvement in the supply of funds
for the mortgage market. 1/
One indication of the greater availability of funds at
private lenders is a recent sharp drop in the demand for FNMA forward
purchase commitments. In the auction at the end of December, bids to
purchase FNMA commitments totaled only $61 million, the lowest for any
auction since this system began in May 1968. Moreover, FNMA has just
held its first auction to sell off a small portion of its 8-1/2 per
cent Government-underwritten mortgage portfolio. Although the move to
sell $25 million of mortgages at this time may in part be an effort to
enhance the Corporation's first quarter earnings report,2/ FNMA would
be unable to conduct such an auction if mortgage market conditions had
not eased considerably.
The increase in availability of funds has coincided with
some reduction in mortgage interest rates and has led to speculation of
a further downward movement in these rates in the period immediately
ahead. Although the empirical evidence of a sharp downward adjustment

in mortgage interest rates following the recent cuts in the FHA and VA
ceiling rate and the prime interest rate is not yet fully available,
trade sources and the FNMA auction results suggest that home mortgage
interest rates are continuing to decline.
Based on the FHA field market survey for November, conducted
just prior to the FHA-VA ceiling rate reduction, yields both in the
primary market for conventional home loans and in the FHA secondary
market declined modestly. However, in the three FNMA auctions conducted
in December, the implicit private market yield for 6-month commitments
dropped more than 50 basis points and by the end of the month was nearly
100 basis points below its 1970 high.

In contrast to an otherwise improved mortgage market report,
the quality of outstanding mortgage credit apparently deteriorated
somewhat during the third quarter. Delinquency rates rose in the third
quarter to the highest rate since 1967, according to the Mortgage
Bankers Association, and the proportion of mortgages in foreclosure was
also reported to be at the highest third quarterrate in three years.
Regionally, increases in delinquency rates were highest in those areas
most affected by layoffs in the defense and aerospace industries. With
layoffs in these industries continuing and with economic activity
remaining relatively weak, it appears likely that both the delinquency
and the foreclosure rates may have risen somewhat further in the fourth
quarter.

Corporate and municipal securities markets. The rally that
brought yields on newly issued corporate bonds down over 100 basis
points since late October stalled in mid-December. Municipal bond
yields, which had also declined a full percentage point over the same

III -11
period, rose 25 basis points in the last three weeks of the year under
the pressure of a new offering total that almost equalled the postwar
record set in October of 1968. Equity markets, however, continued to
improve through December, with most of the strength, as in previous
months, occurring in the higher quality stocks.

Lack of new issue activity in the corporate market made it
impossible to take interest rate readings on new offerings in the final
weeks of the year, but the unusually heavy dealer positions in late
December gave evidence of investor resistance to lower rates. The
unsold portion of New York Telephone bonds--originally offered on
December 14 at a yield ahead of the market--acounted for most of the

III -12
bonds still in syndicate at year-end. Furthermore, for the first time
in two months, several syndicates were terminated with unsold positions
in late December, resulting in upward yield adjustments of 12 to 14
basis points, and the New York Telephone syndicate came under heavy
pressure in early January when a new Bell System issue was sold at a
reoffering yield of 7.85--25 basis points above the yield on the com-
parable bonds still in syndicate. Although underwriters are looking
forward to an upsurge in demand for securities in January, when rein-
vestment flows are normally heavy, the steadily building forward calendar
for early 1971 suggest that any appreciable near-term reduction in the
supply of bonds is unlikely.
Corporate bond issues offered publicly in December totalled
over $2.2 billion, a record level for this month and a fitting close
for a year in which corporations raised $25 billion in the public bond
markets. Although the volume of stock offerings in 1970 was little
changed from the 1969 level and the annual volume of private placements
fell for the fourth year in a row, total corporate security offerings
last year amounted to $38 billion, a 44 per cent increase over the 1969
new issue volume.

The staff now estimates that public bond offerings by corpora-
tions in the first quarter of 1971, even though they will probably be
20 per cent below the fourth quarter 1970 pace, may approximate the $2.0
billion monthly average volume of 1970. Underwriters suggest that a
number of corporations that have delayed filing new issues in expecta-
tion of lower interest rates will probably now schedule issues during
the first quarter. Furthermore, prospective issuers with lower ratings
and less well-known names than the large industrials that were responsible
for much of the 1970 bond total are finding access to the market some-
what easier at the lower rate levels now prevailing. Such issuers are
reported to be having difficulty in obtaining accommodation at commercial
banks. As in December, the January and February calendar contains a
lower-than-normal proportion of utility bonds and a larger number of
issues under $100 million and issues by financial firms and transporta-
tion companies.

III -14
There is as yet no evidence of a pickup in private placements
in the next few months, and the staff estimates of takedowns have been
reduced accordingly. Announced stock issues by public utilities in the
first quarter of 1971 have returned to normal levels; and, despite the
recent strength in the stock market, the equity calendar remains below
the monthly average levels of 1969 and 1970.

Long-term debt issues by State and local governments in 1970
also set a new record, an annual volume of $17.8 billion, which was
45 per cent higher than the 1969 total. Municipal long-term bond
offerings in December far exceeded staff estimates made a month earlier
as issuers rushed into the market on the heels of sharp declines in the
Bond Buyer index. The addition of a number of large revenue issues
boosted the December total for tax-exempt offerings to $2.2 billion.
This unseasonally heavy volume and the normal end-of-the-year
slowing in trading activity contributed to the buildup of large dealer

III -15
inventories in mid-December and brought the prolonged late 1970
municipal market rally to a halt. The deterioration in the market
occurred despite the continued heavy purchases of tax-exempt securities
by banks, which are reported to be making more acquisitions in the
15-year maturity range than they had in previous weeks.
Underwriters expect first-quarter tax-exempt volume to set
new records. Based on current schedulings for January, the backlog of
authorized but unsold issues, and the needs for funding short-term debt,
the staff estimates that January sales of tax-exempts will be about $2
billion. February volume is expected to be little, if any, lower.
However, so long as commercial banks continue to add to their holdings
of municipals at the recent pace, the market should be able to accommo-
date this volume without a sharp rise in the level of rates.
Government securities market. Yields on U.S. Government
securities rose about 10 to 20 basis points during the latter half of
December. This weaker market atmosphere reflected dealer restiveness
about their very large inventories, at a time of evident weakening in
other securities markets, increased talk of a possible Treasury pre-
refunding, and concern about the possible loss of Government security
insurance. The rate increases occurred despite the further reduction
in the bank prime rate and System purchases of coupon issues totaling
about $400 million.

In the Treasury bill market, rate increases were smaller than
in the bond market, although dealers' inventories of bills also remained
at high levels. Because of their large positions, dealers generally
have bid unaggressively for additional new bills in recent monthly and
weekly auctions.

Other short-term credit markets. Final November data on
commercial and finance company paper showed a seasonally adjusted
decline of $1,526 million, $361 million more than estimated in the
November Greenbook on the basis of data up to November 25. Most of the
difference was in finance company paper, which declined in the last
week of the month.
The seasonally unadjusted weekly data indicate that the down-
ward movement in finance company and dealer paper has continued into
December. However, since there is usually a seasonal decline for the
month, it is too early to evaluate December as a whole.

III -18
Favorable competitive rates on certificates of deposit and
a weakening in short-term bank loans have contributed to a further
decline in bank-related commercial paper, which fell $655 million dur-
ing the first three weeks of December as compared with $573 million in
November. The cumulative decline in bank-related commercial paper since
mid-August is now $5.1 billion.
While bill rates tended to decline until mid-month and then
drift back up, other short-term interest rates largely stabilized in the
December 2-December 30 period following earlier declines. On net the
largest change for the month was a 3/8 of a percentage point increase
in one-month finance company paper.

Federal finance. The Board's staff's Federal Budget estimates
have not changed significantly since the December Greenbook. On a
unified budget basis, the staff projects a Federal deficit in the current
fiscal year of about $15.5 billion with outlays of $212 billion.
Expenditure estimates for the current and for the next fiscal
year are still rather uncertain. Estimates for both fiscal years
depend upon Presidential action with respect to the Federal pay raise
recently passed by Congress. The bill gives the President considerable
control over the amount and timing of the increase. While it is expected
that he will sign the bill, the increase approved may be less than the
6 per cent assumed in the staff estimates. In regard to the next fiscal

III -21
year, the Administration may propose several new budget programs in the
January budget message but it has decided against major new taxes for
the time being. In terms of spending projections, a substantial increase
in Federal grants and transfer payments is possible depending on the
outcome of the revenue sharing program, the House-Senate action on the
social security benefit increase, a probable new medical program pro-
posal and other grant-in aid programs. In addition, some observers
expect that the January budget message will propose larger appropriations
for defense, which might increase the rate of defense spending during the
second half of the calendar 1971.
On a NIA basis the staff projects a Federal deficit of about
$14.6 billion in the current fiscal year and $15.2 billion in calendar
1971. Projected actual receipts for calendar 1971, $209.0 billion,
indicate that the shortfall in receipts, due to the operation of the
economy below potential, will be approximately $18 billion. On a high
employment basis, receipts would exceed expenditures in the calendar
year by approximately $4.0 billion.
The short-term outlook for the Treasury cash balance is
better than previously estimated partly due to delay in the social
security benefit increase and partly due to large receipts from leases
of off-shore oil. It now appears that the Treasury might be able to
postpone new borrowing until sometime in March, but given the large
cash needs in March, the Treasury might still choose to raise some cash
in connection with the February refunding.

III -22
In the first six months of 1971, net repayment of Federal
debt is projected at about $2.3 billion in comparison to a net repay-
ment of $4.4 billion during the same period last year. Agency borrowing
in the first and second quarters of 1971 is projected to be negligible
on a net basis, compared to the $4.8 billion increase in debt during the
first half of 1970.

THE ECONOMIC PICTURE IN DETAIL
International Developments
U.S. balance of payments. In the fourth quarter of 1970
the over-all balance-of-payments position did not appear to improve
quite as much as had been hoped for, considering the size of the
inflow that seemed to be required to satisfy the direct-investment
regulations. Moreover, developments in merchandise exports and
imports, discussed in some detail below, resulted in a shrinking of
the export surplus to an annual rate of only $0.2 billion in October-
November. Although some retreat from the strong trade performance
of mid-year was expected, the decline occurred earlier and much more
sharply than had been anticipated.
In view of the large and variable flows of funds at year
end, it is difficult to estimate the over-all balance. Our preliminary
guess is that the rate of adjusted liquidity deficit for the fourth
quarter was of the magnitude of $3.0 billion, annual rate, not much
changed from the third quarter rate. (The combined deficit for October
and November, not seasonally adjusted but before special transactions,
was about $925 million. For December, the weekly data plus a figure
for the change in liabilities to branches on December 31 suggest an
unadjusted liquidity surplus of perhaps $1.0 billion. The fourth
quarter is seasonally expected to be quite favorable.) The liquidity

IV -2
deficit for the year (before special transactions or SDR allocations)
would thus be somewhat below $5.0 billion. For the year 1969 the
comparable deficit was $6.0 billion. Special transactions with
foreign governments had the effect of worsening the 1969 balance by
$1.0 billion, so that the published deficit was $7.0 billion, while
in 1970 such transactions reduced the deficit by about $300 million.
Information on capital flows in the fourth quarter is very
scant at this time. Bank-reported claims on foreigners rose $213
million in November, following comparable outflows in September and
October. This does not seem to be out of line with normal seasonal
expectations. U.S. purchases of foreign securities (net) were quite
small in November, and though there may have been an increase in
December (when a sizable Canadian issue was offered) were probably
much lower than in the third quarter. For the year as a whole the
outflow was well below the $1.5 billion of 1969. The behavior of
the year-end data suggest somewhat less window-dressing of direct
investments than in 1969. For the first three quarters of 1970 the
net outflow of U.S. corporate funds was $640 million higher than in
the same period of 1969; in the fourth quarter of 1969 there was no
net outflow, but there may have been a small outflow in the final
quarter of 1970.
Foreign net purchases of U.S. corporate stocks were about
$100 million in November, off somewhat from the $150 million per
month average of August-October. The U.S. stock market has been

IV -3
performing markedly better than other major markets since June.
There was also a continuing sizable inflow of foreign funds to
purchase U.S. corporate bonds.
On the official settlements basis there was an unadjusted
deficit in December of perhaps $650 million -- based on incomplete data.
This would be very much lower than the November deficit of $2.0
billion, when repayments of Euro-dollar borrowings were at peak
rates. For the fourth quarter, the seasonally adjusted official
settlements deficit was roughly $3-1/2 billion, and for the year
this deficit was about $10-1/2 billion (before SDR allocation).
For the quarter, as for the year as a whole, this record deficit
was financed about one-third by a decline in U.S. reserve assets
and two-thirds by an increase in U.S. liabilities to foreign
official agencies.
The 1970 deficit on the official settlements basis was,
of course, swollen by the exceptional $6 billion rundown in U.S.
liabilities to commercial banks abroad, just as in 1969 the balance
had been distorted in the other direction by huge inflows. The
average deficit for the two years taken together was about $4 billion
per year, and this figure may be taken as roughly representative
of the size of the underlying disequilibrium that persists as a
new year begins.

IV -4
U.S. foreign trade. The trade balance in November 1970
was in deficit by $0.5 billion at a seasonally adjusted annual
rate (balance-of-payments basis), down from the already small $0.9
billion surplus in October. This continued the steady deterioration
in the trade balance which began in mid-1970, as exports have tended
to fall while imports have reached record heights. The export
surplus in October-November of $0.2 billion at an annual rate was
almost $2.7 billion below the third-quarter level. For the first
11 months of 1970 combined, the surplus stood at an annual rate of
$2.3 billion.
Exports in the October-November period were $42.0 billion
at a seasonally adjusted annual rate, balance-of-payments basis --
1.7 per cent lower than in the third quarter and only 5-1/2 per
cent higher than in the same period of 1969. Exports of agricultural
products increased, but not by enough to offset declines in non-
agricultural exports.

Among the agricultural exports, wheat, rice, corn, unmanu-
factured tobacco, and cotton were all up significantly in October-
November compared with the third quarter. The increase in wheat and
corn exports reflected the continued shortage in foreign supplies and
the strong growth in foreign demand for animal feeds, while the rise in
cotton and tobacco shipments represented primarily a recovery from
relatively low third-quarter levels. Soybean exports, after seasonal
adjustment, on the other hand, were off somewhat from the extremely
buoyant third-quarter rate despite high October and November prices
(unit values). Exports of oils and fats and hides and skins were also
lower in October-November, on the average, than in the third quarter.
The fall in exports of nonagricultural commodities between
the third quarter and October-November is more than accounted for by
sizable declines in steel and automotive exports. The decline in
steel exports reflected a return to the pre-boom levels of the first
half of 1969 as tight supply conditions in Western Europe and Japan
eased. The reduction in exports of cars was associated mainly with
the GM strike.
Exports of civilian aircraft, in contrast, were much higher
in October-November than in the third quarter. Smaller gains were
made in shipments of coal, chemicals, and machinery.
In October-November, exports to Canada, the EEC countries,
and Japan -- which together account for about 50 per cent of total U.S.
exports -- were below third-quarter levels. These declines exceeded
the increases in exports to the rest of the world.

IV -6
Imports in October-November were at a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of $41.8 billion (balance-of-payments basis), 5 per cent
above the already high third-quarter level and 9 per cent higher than
in the same period of 1969. Sizable increases occurred in imports of
petroleum, industrial materials, and automobiles. Gains were registered
also in imports of machinery and miscellaneous consumer goods, groups
for which there has been a steady upward trend over the years. Imports
of food and crude materials were the only categories with a lower
average in October-November than in the third quarter.
Imports of petroleum were significantly higher in October-
November as the United States continued to face domestic fuel shortages.
Further increases are expected in 1971 as the liberalization of import
quotas becomes effective.
Despite the slackening in U.S. domestic production, imports
of industrial materials in October-November were substantially above
third-quarter levels. Imports of textile yarns and fabrics attained
record highs for 1970, as foreign suppliers and U.S. importers reacted
to the possible imposition of U.S. quotas. Imports of chemicals and
metals, particularly steel, also showed great gains. The October-
November increase in steel imports can be attributed mainly to
semifinished steel mill products from the European Economic Community,
where supply conditions have continued to ease. Not only has the
volume of steel imports resumed an upward trend during 1970 but import
unit values have been significantly above last year's average.

IV -7
Imports of automobiles were higher in October-November than
in the third quarter. This was especially true of imports from Canada
despite the fact that the GM strike continued in Canada through mid-
December.
In October-November, imports from all major areas, except
Australia and Latin America, exceeded third quarter levels. Especially
large increases occurred in imports from Canada and Japan.
An important factor in the larger than expected rise in
imports in 1970 was the jump in import prices -- as measured by
unit values. In the third quarter of 1970 unit values of imports of
finished manufactures were 11.2 per cent higher than a year earlier
and for total imports the price increase was 9.6 per cent. At the
same time the quantity of total imports, and of the finished
manufactures category, appears to have been lower in the third quarter
of last year than in the third quarter of 1969. This was quite
different from the experience in 1968-69, when price increases were
small but quantity increases were large. The value of U.S. exports
also reflected higher prices in 1970, but less so than imports. In
the third quarter export unit values were up about 5-3/4 per cent
over the year before.
Euro-dollar market. Liabilities of U.S. banks to their
foreign branches continued to decline, on balance, in December, with
large day-to-day fluctuations. In the four week computation period for

IV -8
Euro-dollar reserve requirements ended December 23, gross liabilities
to foreign branches are estimated to have averaged about $600 million
below their daily average in the preceeding computation period.
Weekly Wednesday data show a decline of about $700 million from
November 25 to December 23, to a total of $8.1 billion (including
domestic loan participations).
From December 23 to 31 liabilities to foreign branches
declined further by about $1.2 billion ($400 million by December 30
and the remainder on December 31). There is little doubt that this
drop primarily reflects foreign branch financing of American corporate
repatriations to be largely reversed in early January. However, in
the first half of the December 24-January 20 computation period
U.S. banks' gross liabilities to foreign branches appear to have
averaged about $700 million below the average for the computation
period ended December 23. If the banks are going to rebuild
borrowings to the average level of the last computation period they
will have to bid heavily for funds in the next two weeks.
Interest rates in the Euro-dollar market reached their
December highs around mid-month, and since then have declined
substantially. Call and one-month deposit rates have declined from
about 8-1/2 per cent in mid-December to around 6-1/4 per cent --
remaining somewhat above their late November levels. Rates for
three-month and longer maturities advanced to a high of about 7-7/8
per cent in mid-December; as of early January rates in these maturities

IV -9
are down to a range of about 6-1/2 to 7 per cent -- moderately below
their late November levels. With the sharp run-up in rates in early
December the excess of Euro-dollar rates over the cost of domestic
sources of funds to U.S. banks had widened to very high levels
(See table). By the first few days in January the excess of the
call Euro-dollar rate over the Federal funds rate declined to about
1 per cent (still well above the November average differential)
while the excess of the three-month Euro-dollar rate over the (adjusted)
60-89 day CD rate declined to about 1/2 to 3/4 per cent.

Foreign exchange markets. During December exchange rates
moved mainly in response to changes in interest differentials between
the Euro-dollar market and national money markets. Foreign currencies
generally eased over the first half of the month as Euro-dollar rates
increased, then firmed toward month-end as Euro-dollar rates declined.
Outright spot dollar purchases by major European central banks and the
Bank of Canada amounted to about $300 million for the month, compared
to a massive $1.9 billion in November. The pace of market activity
picked up somewhat in the first few days of January, but there was no
major intervention by foreign central banks.
The German mark rate dropped dramatically in early December,
touching parity briefly, as the Bundesbank's discount rate cut on
December 2, the second in two weeks, combined with sharply higher
Euro-dollar rates to halt the movement of funds into Germany. Later
in the month the mark firmed moderately with the decline in Euro-dollar
interest rates. During the month of December, the Bundesbank sold a
nominal amount of dollars, in sharp contrast to November when it had
purchased $1.3 billion in intervention operations.
The Dutch guilder, Belgian franc, and Italian lira exchange
rates also softened in the first half of December but firmed later. The
central banks of Belgium and the Netherlands each purchased a small
amount of dollars during December, and the Bank of Italy purchased
$156 million.

IV -11
The French franc rate moved only slightly during December.
The Bank of France purchased about $50 million during the month,
compared with $180 million in November.
Sterling appeared relatively unaffected by the early
December firming of Euro-dollar rates, as the exchange rate held
in a narrow range around $2.39. The pound advanced in late December
as Euro-dollar rates eased relative to British interest rates and
moved above $2.3950 in early January.
Strong commercial demand for the Canadian dollar, coupled
with some short-covering of Canadian dollar positions by New York
banks, led to a strong advance in its rate, from around 98 U.S. cents
in early December to about 99 cents at year end.

IV -13
Prices and wages in major industrialized countries. The
economies of the Common Market countries and of the United Kingdom
and Japan continued to experience a rapid rate of price inflation in
1970. Increases in the cost of living during the year in these
countries -- as measured by consumer prices -- ranged from about 4
per cent in Belgium and Germany to over 7 per cent in Britain. In
Canada, by contrast, the rate of inflation substantially slowed last
year, as a broad array of restrictive measures helped reduce the
increase in the cost of living from 4.5 per cent during 1969 to less
than 3 per cent during 1970.
The rate of inflation generally appeared to moderate after
the first quarter, but price increases accelerated in Japan and the
Netherlands in the latter part of the summer and in Germany during the
autumn. In the United Kingdom, a burst of inflationary wage settle-
ments in the fourth quarter portends a spurt in the rate of price
inflation in the near future.
Inflation during 1970 was largely a function of steeply
rising wages, whose rate of advance was little impeded by demand
restraint measures and which overwhelmed the deflationary effects of
such developments as a sharp drop in metals prices.
Substantial rises in unit wage costs -- in many instances
reflecting not only the inevitably faster increase in wages than in
prices but also unusually low advances in productivity -- caused a
pervasive squeeze on profits.

IV -14
Despite continued inflation, consumers were not stampeded
into forsaking money for goods. In many countries the rise in real
income exceeded the increase in real consumer expenditures. The
restraint shown by consumers -- at a time when inflationary expecta-
tions were presumably strong -- implied widespread concern over the
impact on employment of the efforts of most governments to curb the
growth of aggregate demand.
Despite the predominant role of wage increases in the
current inflation, none of the large European countries has moved
to supplement tight fiscal and monetary policy with direct controls
over price and wage increases. Japan, however, recently instituted
a modified price freeze, and several smaller European countries --

the Netherlands, Finland, Norway, Sweden, and Denmark -- have imposed
direct curbs of one sort or another on prices and wages. (Ireland
introduced price and wage controls in October but abandoned them in
December.) Why the smaller countries are resorting to direct controls
while the larger countries are not is not clear. One reason may be
that such controls can be more easily and more equitably administered
in smaller countries.
It seems unlikely that the rate of price inflation will
significantly abate this year, primarily because there is little
indication that the current wage inflation will diminish to any
marked degree.

Despite clear signs of a slowdown in economic activity, the
rate of price inflation in Germany remains high, at least by German
standards. The rate of increase in prices, particularly those for
investment goods and consumer durables, advanced sharply in October
and November, after several months of more moderate increases. (Production
of these goods rose in October after declining in August and September.)
Wages, too, have climbed more rapidly in recent months than
earlier in the year -- with settlements generally providing annual hikes
of 12 per cent -- and these pay boosts may largely explain the apparent
acceleration in the advance of prices lately.

Though faster in 1970 than in 1969, the rate of price inflation
in Germany last year was low in comparison to other major countries.
Consumer prices, for instance, increased by only about 4 per cent during
the year. The previous year the increase was about 3 per cent. The rise
in 1970 would have been somewhat greater but for the effect of the 1969
revaluation on food prices, which under. Common Market rules are based
on dollar values.
German industry was less able to absorb wage increases last
year than in 1969 because of a slowing in productivity gains. Unit wage
costs rose by a sizable 8 per cent in 1970 over 1969. Consequently,
profits were squeezed last year. Wages and salaries per employed person
rose by 14 per cent between September-November 1969 and the same three
months in 1969. The comparable 1968-69 increase was 11 per cent.
The Council of Economic Experts expects a slight decline in
the rate of inflation in 1971, to about 3-1/2 per cent for consumer
prices. Its forecast apparently assumes that wage settlements this year
will be more moderate, first because the contracts up for negotiation
will affect fewer workers and, second, because those affected are thought
to be less militant than the workers involved in wage settlements last
year. The Council also assumes that the anticipated slackening in real
growth will extend to consumer expenditures, which so far have remained
buoyant.
Consumer prices in France in October were about 5-1/2 per cent
higher than a year earlier. Wages in 1970 increased more rapidly than in

IV -18
any other post-war year except 1968, when the Grenelle agreement in the
aftermath of the May civil disturbances had raised wage rates in manufac-
turing by over 10 per cent in the second quarter alone. Hourly rates rose
by 10.5 per cent from the third quarter of 1969 to the third quarter of
1970.
French inflation has been primarily cost-push, reflecting not
only wage pressures but also gradual food price increases under the
European Common Agricultural Policy as modified by agreement with the
Community after the devaluation of the franc in 1969. Under the CAP
rules, food prices are measured in dollars and thus had to be raised when
the franc was devalued but France was permitted to raise prices in several
stages.
Despite the sizable increases in money and real wages, real
consumption expenditures have been sluggish, largely because of the
prohibitive restrictions on installment buying in effect until October
and the public's desire to rebuild savings depleted in the buying spree
in the spring and summer of 1969.
Inflation is likely to continue at the current rate in 1971,
with wage increases expected to be well in excess of productivity
gains, as they were in 1970. The government, early in 1970, urged
that wage contracts link wage hikes to productivity increases, but
this attempt at incomes policy appears to have been a failure.
In Italy, there has been a deceleration in the rate of
increase in prices since March -- moderate with respect to consumer

IV -19
prices, but marked in the case of wholesale prices of non-agricultural
goods.
Wholesale prices rose by over 9 per cent from March 1969 to
March 1970 but only by about 4-1/2 per cent, annual rate, from March to
September. Sharp slowing of the increases in import prices of basic
materials and semi-manufactures and in wage rates were the principal
contributors to this development. Import prices, after increasing by
about 15 per cent from March 1969 to March 1970, were virtually flat
from March to August.
Wage rates in industry rose by a substantial 8.5 per cent
annual rate from February to August, but this was far below the more
than 20 per cent increase in the year February 1969 to February 1970.
The slowing reflected the fact that most of the wage increases won
during the strikes of late 1969 became effective immediately in
January 1970 rather than being spread out over the three years for
which most of the contracts will be valid.
The more moderate slowing of the rise of consumer prices --
exclusive of food, they advanced by 3.7 per cent, annual rate, from
March to August, compared to 5 per cent in the year to March -- in
part reflects the lag with which retail prices respond to changes in
wholesale prices. Moreover, the rise in consumer prices would have
slowed more markedly but for the acceleration of wage increase in
services, which rose by 18 per cent, annual rate, from February to
August after rising by only 10 per cent in the year up to February.

IV -20
In Italy too the rise in real consumption appears to have
been substantially less than the increase in real income of wage
earners.
Italian inflation has been mainly cost-push in character.
This summer the government, concerned that growing aggregate demand
might aggravate the problem, increased sales taxes and raised employers'
contributions to social security, the latter effective January 1, 1971.
In the United Kingdom, there was no appreciable change in
the rate at which prices of consumer goods advanced during the second
half of 1970 compared to the first half. In the five months June to
November the retail price index rose by about 7 per cent, annual rate,
little changed from the 7.7 per cent annual rate rise in the five
months January to June. Wholesale prices of manufactured goods
moved up in similar fashion, at annual rates of 7.4 per cent in
January-June, and 6.7 per cent in June-November.
Wage inflation, however, accelerated in the latter part of
the year, weekly wage rates rising by more than a 14 per cent (annual
rate) in June-November, after increasing by about 10 per cent annual
rate in the preceding five months. Wages spurted up particularly
sharply in November, reflecting recently granted boosts of 10 to 15 per
cent a year for about 2 million workers.
Both prices and wages increased much more rapidly in 1970
than in 1969. From September-November 1968 to September-November 1969,
retail prices increased by 5.3 per cent, wholesale prices of manufactures

IV -21
by 4.3 per cent, and weekly wage rates by 5.6 per cent. The increases
for retail and wholesale prices between the same three-monthly periods
in 1969 and 1970 were 7.4 and 7.3 per cent, respectively, while wage
rates rose by 11.9 per cent during this interval. Total wage earnings
per worker increased even more rapidly, by 13 per cent from third
quarter 1969 to third quarter 1970.
British inflation in 1970 was clearly of the cost-push
variety, occurring against a background of high unemployment, which
has not appreciably diminished in recent months despite a strong and
steady rise in industrial production since July. The upward push on
prices came primarily from wages, which began to increase at an
accelerated pace in the summer and autumn of 1969.
Real consumer expenditures rose only moderately during 1970.
The rise in the proportion of income saved that occurred last year --
presumably a period of strong expectations of further inflation --
suggests that concern with inflation was outweighed by other considera-
tions, notably fear of unemployment.
Under the pressure of rising wage costs, company pre-tax
profits have steadily fallen at an annual rate of about 10 per cent
since the third quarter of 1969.
To bring inflation under control, the government is relying
primarily on restrictive monetary policy and encouragement to employers
to resist exorbitant wage demands. The present policy of eschewing
statutory limits on wage and price increases apparently won a measure

IV -22
of vindication last month when outraged public opinion prompted
Britain's electric power workers to terminate a work "slowdown" by
which they had hoped to force acceptance of their wage demands. The
dispute is now before a court of inquiry.
The public's angry response to the power workers' slowdown --
coupled with the rise in disposable income which the income tax cut
in April will produce -- may persuade other unions to put forward
wage demands more moderate than those of recent months. Nevertheless,
wage settlements are likely to continue to be very high compared to
previous years -- in the electric power dispute, for example, manage-
ment was offering a 10 per cent a year wage boost -- and neither price
nor wage inflation can be expected to abate significantly in 1971.
With the economy now growing, in real terms, at about its capacity
rate of 3 per cent a year, and with growth likely to be sustained at
this rate through 1971, inflation might even be intensified by the
addition of demand to cost pressures. A more rapid increase in produc-
tivity, which is likely to accompany the recovery in the growth of
output, might, however, partially offset the inflationary impact of
excessive wage increases.
In Belgium, wholesale prices of finished industrial goods
increased by about 4.5 per cent,annual rate,from March to October,
following a rise of about 6 per cent in the March 1969-March 1970
interval. The 1970 increase took place despite a decline in prices of
industrial semi-finished goods and raw materials associated with
decreases in import prices of these items.

IV -23
The increase of consumer prices slowed after April, almost
entirely because of a leveling off in food prices. In contrast, the
rate of increase in prices of non-food items has not slowed; in October
prices of consumer goods other than food were almost 3 per cent higher
than a year earlier. The increase from April 1969 to April 1970 had
been 2.3 per cent.
Wages during 1970 increased at an accelerated rate. The year-
to-year rise in hourly rates in manufacturing increased from 9 per cent
in December 1969 to almost 12 per cent in September.
Aggregate demand, by contrast, increased more slowly in 1970
than in 1969, and the cost-push element took on increasing importance in
explaining the increase in Belgian prices.
The introduction of a value-added tax in Belgium this month is
expected to have a significant inflationary impact.
Inflationary pressures in the Netherlands intensified during
the second half of 1970, leading to the reimposition of tight restrictions
on price increases. These restrictions are to remain in effect until
March. In December, price controls were supplemented by moderate curbs
on wages, which will limit wage increases in new contracts to 4 per cent
over a six month period.
The suspension of price controls at mid-year was a major factor
in the increased rate of price rises, as was a series of strikes last
summer which succeeded in winning substantial wage hikes. The surge in
strike activity reflected a catch-up effort by Dutch workers, whose real
income rose much less rapidly than real GNP in 1969.

IV -24
Dutch inflation is not only a cost-push phenomenon, however.
The economy has been operating essentially at full capacity for two years,
with strong demand for Dutch exports in 1969 and vigorous domestic demand
in 1970 putting intense pressure on domestic resources. The government,
apparently intent on cooling the boom, has proposed several tax increases
and expenditure cuts in its draft 1971 budget.
Consumer prices actually rose faster during 1969 than last year.
From August-October 1968 to August-October 1969 consumer prices, for example,
rose by about 8 per cent, compared to 5.5 per cent between the same periods
in 1969 and 1970. The more rapid increase in 1969 resulted from the steep
price increases associated with the introduction of a value-added tax
early that year. Price increases moderated in late 1969 in response to
the imposition of price controls in September. These were removed in June
1970.
Despite a decline in Japanese wholesale prices since mid-1970 --
resulting mainly from a drop in prices of metals -- consumer prices in
Japan have risen rapidly in recent months. The government responded in
December by imposing a price freeze on goods and services whose prices
it is empowered to regulate. The affected items have a total weight of
almost 20 per cent in the consumer price index.
A major objective of this action -- which came only two months
after monetary policy was eased in October -- is to induce labor unions
to exhibit moderation in their wage demands this spring. But the government

IV -25
has indicated that it may be necessary to introduce an incomes policy to
restrain wages as well as prices.
For the last two years, cost-push factors have played an
increasingly important part in driving up prices in Japan. In partic-
ular, wages in 1969 and 1970, in contrast to previous years, increased
somewhat faster than productivity. The rate of inflation in Japan was
greater in 1970 than in 1969. The year-to-year rise in consumer prices
was about 7.5 per cent in 1969-70 compared to only 5.2 per cent in 1968-
69. Wages also rose faster last year -- 18 per cent in 1970 over 1969,
compared to 15 per cent in 1969 over 1968.
Price performance in Canada has improved considerably since the
early months of this year, reflecting the effective restraint of domestic
demand, the measure of success achieved by the Prices and Incomes Commission
in obtaining restraint in pricing by business, and the appreciation of the
Canadian dollar. Over the period April-November, consumer prices rose at
an annual rate of only about 1.5 per cent. Although this result was influ-
enced by the downturn in food prices, the rate of increase of the consumer
price index excluding food has also decelerated; it rose by only a little
more than 3 per cent (seasonally adjusted annual rate) in this period
against 4.6 per cent in the previous 12 months. Wholesale prices have
tended to decline since the second quarter of this year.
The progress made in bringing down the rate of price inflation
occurred even though there has been little evidence of a moderation

IV -26
in the rate of wage increases, notwithstanding the rise in unemployment --
to 6.9 per cent in September, after which it declined to 6.5 per cent in
November. Though a wage guideline of 6 per cent had been announced early
in 1970 by the Prices and Incomes Commission, the average annual increase
in base rates resulting from major wage settlements was around 9 per cent
during the first 9 months of 1970. Data on hourly earnings also showed
wages rising at close to that rate through the autumn.
Despite the continuation of wage inflation, the Prices and
Incomes Commission dropped its wage-price guidelines at the end of the
year because of labor's refusal to accept them and business' unwillingness
to support them in the absence of cooperation from other groups.
Because of rising unemployment, the government adopted several
moderately expansionary fiscal and monetary measures last year. Most
recently, in December, a revised budget for the year ending March 13 was
presented to Parliament, providing for increased unemployment benefits,
more federal government aid to the provinces and an additional allocation
of funds to various governmental departments and agencies for capital
investment in regions where unemployment is particularly high. Further-
more, a method of calculating capital cost allowances was proposed that is
expected to reduce corporate taxes by about $25 million annually.
It is widely thought, however, that the stimulative action taken
by the government will not reduce unemployment in 1971 to the point where
tight capacity will exert significant inflationary pressure.
