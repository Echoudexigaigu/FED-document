SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK
Nonfinancial
Recent data support the expectation of a very large rise in
GNP this quarter--reflecting a post-strike surge in auto production, a
sharp rise in residential construction, and (to a lesser extent) a
stockpiling of steel as a hedge against a possible strike. We are now
projecting a first-quarter rise in real GNP at an annual rate of about
6 per cent, following the 3.3 per cent decline of the fourth quarter.
Industrial production is tentatively estimated to have in-
creased about 1 point in January, to a level 2 per cent above the
November 1970 low. The January rise is attributable to autos and steel.
Auto sales have increased appreciably, but less than expected, and
production schedules for February have been cut back. Other retail
sales are estimated to have remained at about the December level, which
was above the fourth-quarter average.
Virtually all of the December rise in manufacturers' new orders
for durable goods was also attributable to autos (where orders and
shipments are taken as equivalent) and steel. Book value of manufacturers'
inventories declined in December following two months of sizable increases.
For the fourth quarter as a whole, manufacturing inventories rose as
rapidly as in the previous quarter. Ratios of inventories to sales and
to unfilled orders declined in December, but generally remained at high
levels.

I -2
Progress on the price front has been limited and irregular,
with occasional reversals. In January, seasonally adjusted wholesale
prices of farm products and foods rose sharply after a sustained decline,
but the rise in industrial prices was small. The consumer price index
rose sharply in December, following a marked slowing of the advance in
November. The rate of increase in the GNP deflator for private product
appears to have changed little since late 1969, after allowing for
fluctuations in the composition of product.
Outlook. The staff's current projections of a first-quarter
rise of $26 billion in current dollar GNP and an increase at an annual
rate of 6 per cent in real GNP, are both below the preceding projections.
Over the fourth and first quarters together, real growth is expected to
be at an annual rate of only about 1.5 per cent.
The latest projections for 1971 incorporate an allowance for
a sizable build-up of steel stocks--especially in the second quarter--in
anticipation of a possible strike; a depletion of steel stocks in the
third quarter as a result of a strike, which is assumed to last two
months; and a rebuilding of stocks in the fourth quarter. The resulting
quarterly pattern of GNP change is uneven. The sharpness of the projected
rise in fourth-quarter GNP is largely due to the steel strike assumptions,
just as the projected bulge in the first quarter reflects the rebound
in autos.

I-3
The average rate of expansion in real GNP over the last half
of the year is now projected at 3.7 per cent, compared with 3.0 per cent
in the last Greenbook. The faster growth is concentrated in the Federal
and consumer sectors. In line with the new budget, Federal purchases
are shown as rising more in the second half of the year than we had
formerly assumed, following a sharper-than-expected decline in the first
half. Consumer spending in the second half also is expected to increase
somewhat faster than projected earlier.
Despite this slightly stronger outlook, the projected increase
in real GNP over the course of the year still falls short of the economy's
growth potential, indicating a probable further rise in the unemployment
rate and a continued low rate of manufacturing capacity utilization.
Costs are expected to rise appreciably further, even with resources in
ample supply, and we anticipate that the GNP deflator will still be
rising at an annual rate of about 3.5 per cent in the fourth quarter.
Financial
Market expectations of declining interest rates -- which had
weakened briefly in late December -- were renewed early in January by
the quick succession of cuts in the bank prime and Federal Reserve
discount rates and System open market actions to ease money market
conditions. As expectations strengthened, financial institutions moved
aggressively to put seasonally enlarged supplies of funds to work. In
consequence, the heavy continuing volume of new corporate and municipal

I-4
security offerings was absorbed at sharply reduced interest rates, and
the Treasury received an excellent response to its large February
refinancing and pre-refunding. Further rate declines over the month
ranged roughly from 1/2 to 1 1/4 percentage points in short-term
markets and from 3/8 to 7/8 of a percentage point in long-term markets.
But around month-end, investors began to resist additional rate declines,
underwriters' inventories of recently offered new issues began to
accumulate, and yields in some markets tended to back-up.
Bank efforts to stimulate the demand for business loans appear
to have had some success in January. Even so, bank funds continued to
be readily available for investment in Treasury and State and local
government securities. Although private demand deposits at banks grew
significantly less in January than in December, time deposit expansion
continued at a rapid pace, particularly in consumer-type accounts which
became relatively more attractive as market rates declined sharply. Some
banks, in fact, attempted to dampen the pace of savings inflows by
reducing rates being paid on various types of consumer accounts. And
over the month as a whole markdowns of CD offering rates were generally
larger than those on Treasury bills.
Widening rate spreads also stimulated record fund flows to non-
bank thrift institutions, thereby contributing to further cuts of mortgage
rates in a number of areas of the country. And with the supply of new

I-5
mortgages still limited, savings banks continued to be fairly active
bidders for new corporate securities. Even life insurance companies
reportedly increased their interest in business securities, both in
the market and on commitments for private placements. Undoubtedly
this reflected a continuation of the slower growth in policy loans and
the increased flows of repayments on life company loans and investments
evident in December.
Outlook. Over the months immediately ahead borrowing pressures
on securities markets may slacken a bit. From now until mid-year the
Federally sponsored housing finance agencies are expected to be net debt
repayers amounting to possibly $2 billion. With respect to U.S. Treasury
borrowing, Board staff projections indicate net cash borrowing of only
about $1 billion between now and mid-year, although the Treasury normally
repays debt, net, over this period. Even though State and local govern-
ments will very likely continue to borrow in record volume--because of
their heavy backlog of unsatisfied financing needs--their monthly borrowing
totals are likely to average closer to $2 billion over the next month or
two than to the $2.6 billion January figure, which was swollen by a
bunching of large negotiated offerings.
As for business borrowers, the February volume of capital
market financing is likely to be at least as large as in January. But
looking beyond February, most forecasters are less sure of borrowing

I-6
magnitudes since bank efforts to renew business lending are expected
in time to encourage the substitution of bank for capital market
financing.
The projected rapid growth of GNP during the current quarter
is still expected to add to demands for money and for credit, including
consumer credit and business loans at banks. With short-term credit
financing substantial--assuming near-term Treasury cash financing in
bills--downward pressures on short-term market rates may be moderated.
Long-term rates may back up a little over the short-run, but once the
current congestion in intermediate and long-term markets is worked out,
bond yields are more likely to drop somewhat further, given the
historically wide spread of long and short-rates and the possibility
of some slackening in demands for long-term credit as the quarter
progresses.
International developments and the balance of payments
The hoped-for benefits for the balance of payments from the
cooling off of demand in the United States have been considerably eroded
by the easing in foreign demands for industrial materials and machinery
in the course of the second half of last year. The U.S. trade surplus,
which had run at about a $3 billion annual rate during the spring and
summer of 1970, was down to below a $1 billion rate in the fourth
quarter. With the resumption of output of autos and components, and
with increasing aircraft deliveries, exports should rise somewhat more

I-7
than imports in the first quarter, but otherwise the export outlook is
not bright. Monetary policy in both Germany and Britian is still
strongly oriented toward the aim of checking inflation, and measures to
stimulate expansion are still being held in reserve. In many other
countries reductions in discount rates have been made in recent weeks.
U.S. imports dipped in December when auto arrivals from Canada
were belatedly affected by GM's work stoppage at Canadian plants, but
this pause is now over. In coming months steel imports will grow in
anticipation of a U.S. steel strike.
The over-all balance of payments in the fourth quarter showed
a deficit on the liquidity basis of the same order of magnitude ($3 billion
annual rate) as in the third quarter, and a record deficit on the official
settlements basis ($3-1/2 billion seasonally adjusted for the single
quarter). On the liquidity basis the balance was kept from worsening
by the substantial repatriations, more or less as expected, of corporate
funds at the year-end; these were handled to a considerable extent through
U.S. bank branches, reducing the liabilities of U.S. banks to the branches.
In the present quarter, renewed outflows of corporate funds
will tend to offset whatever short-run improvement is occurring in trade.
Interest rate differences between U.S. and other financial markets will
continue to inhibit capital inflows and stimulate outflows, while stock
market advances would attract further foreign buying of equities, already
large in December. Thus, no marked change in either direction is looked

I- 8
for in the first-quarter liquidity balance. January data on reserves
and liquid liabilities are not inconsistent with this picture, though
they are hard to interpret because of the irregularity of seasonal
variations in recent years.
The outflow of repayments by U.S. banks to their branches
abroad became a flood last November, but since then has slowed markedly
as a result of measures taken by the Federal Reserve and the Export-
Import Bank. Total liabilities to the branches of the head offices
plus those of the Export-Import Bank showed little net change from
the end of December to the end of January. In view of international
interest rate relationships, some resumption of the runoff is to be
expected in coming months.

THE ECONOMIC PICTURE IN DETAIL
Domestic Nonfinancial Scene
Gross national product. Preliminary Commerce Department GNP
estimates show an increase of $5.4 billion for the fourth quarter--just
about what we had been projecting. The gain in final sales was somewhat
smaller than we had expected, largely because of a disappointing rate of
consumer outlays, particularly for autos. But weaker final sales--along
with the beginnings of some inventory accumulation in anticipation of a
possible steel strike--resulted in a somewhat greater rate of inventory
accumulation than we had anticipated.

Real GNP declined by 3.3 per cent, annual rate--more than
expected. The implicit GNP price deflator rose very sharply, at an
annual rate of 5.7 per cent compared with 4.6 per cent the previous
quarter. Although there was evidence of further sharp price increases,
much of this accelerated rise was the result of compositional shifts
in GNP resulting from the decline in auto sales because of the GM
strike--which will be reversed in the first quarter. A GNP deflator
with fixed weights (which assumes no change in composition) rose at a
5.0 per cent annual rate last quarter, up from a 4.7 per cent rate of
increase in the third quarter.

We continue to anticipate a substantial post-strike rebound
in GNP in the current quarter, although we have scaled the projected
increase down somewhat--to about $26-1/2 billion--from the $29 billion
projected in the last Greenbook. Major impetus for the upsurge is the
anticipated recovery of auto production and sales from the strike-
depressed fourth quarter level. The rate of sales of domestic autos
projected for the first quarter is not particularly high--in fact, we
have revised our estimate down slightly to an annual rate of 8.3 million
units. But the gain in sales of domestic makes from the fourth quarter,
nevertheless, implies about a $10 billion pickup in consumer expenditures
for autos. Thus, even assuming a rather modest rate of growth in other
consumption expenditures, total outlays by consumers are expected to
rise about $18-1/2 billion.
Of the remaining $11 billion growth in final sales projected
for this quarter, a strong gain in residential construction outlays
accounts for almost $4-1/2 billion. A post-strike rebound in purchases
of motor vehicles by business, some recovery in net exports from the
weak fourth quarter rate and a slightly faster rate of growth of State
and local purchases than in the fourth quarter account for the remainder
of the increase.
Such economic evidence as is currently available appears to
support these projections. While the performance of auto sales was
not up to expectations, the rate was improving during January, and at
mid-month unit domestic sales were at a 7.9 million annual rate. Retail

II -4
sales, apart from autos, apparently showed little change in January,
but they held at the advanced December level, which was above the
fourth quarter average. In residential construction, the surprisingly
sharp increases in new housing starts and permits in December suggest
an even larger increase in outlays for this quarter than we had
previously expected.
In contrast to the large rise in final sales, we now anticipate
a decline in inventory investment this quarter to an annual rate of
less than $1 billion. Inventory totals are being affected by several
opposing forces: on the one hand, dealer auto stocks are being rebuilt
by GM to more normal levels, and somewhat disappointing auto sales may
be reflected in larger stocks of other makes, although production cute
already in effect or announced should limit any unintended accumulation.
In addition, the recent rise of orders suggests a further accumulation
of steel inventories as a hedge against a possible strike on August 1.
(We had formerly excluded any allowance for hedge-buying of steel from
our projections in order to minimize distortions of the underlying
economic picture.) On the other hand, already high inventory-sales
ratios moved further out of line in some key sectors in the fourth
quarter as a result of sluggish final sales; we anticipate some
determined efforts to reduce these ratios. The continued decline in
defense spending should also be reflected in further reductions in
inventories of these products.

II -5
In real terms, the expected first quarter increase in GNP
would total about 6.0 per cent, annual rate. However, taking the
fourth and first quarters together--to neutralize, roughly, the impact
of the GM strike--the average quarterly increase in real terms woud
average about 1-1/2 per cent, at an annual rate, slightly less than we
had projected a month ago.
Growth of GNP should drop back sharply in the second quarter.
However, we are now projecting a somewhat larger increase than formerly,
reflecting expectations of an accelerated pace of inventory accumulation
following achievement of a better balance between stocks and sales in
the first quarter, along with a step-up in acquisition of steel stocks
as the contract expiration date nears. Consumer expenditures are also
expected to be bolstered by an assumed 10 per cent increase in Social
Security benefits made retroactive to the beginning of the year, and
the recent high level of starts indicates larger outlays for residential
construction. But these extra gains would be offset in part by the
continued decline in Federal defense purchases indicated for this
period by the new Budget. In summary, we are now projecting a GNP
increase of about $19-1/2 billion for the second quarter--in real terms,
a rise of 3.7 per cent, annual rate.
We have assumed that the pattern of activity in the second
half of 1971 will be strongly affected by a steel strike, beginning
August 1 and lasting approximately 60 days. About 350,000 -400,000
workers would likely be affected directly by such a walkout. Based

II -6
upon past experience it appears that production of autos, appliances
and machinery can be maintained; pre-strike inventory accumulation
will be augmented by continued production of steel companies not affected
by the strike and by some increase in imports. The major impact of the
strike would thus be a sharp reduction in the rate of inventory accumula-
tion in the third quarter with a rebound in the fourth.

depreciation rules for tax purposes. Larger income flows should also
be reflected in an improved consumer outlook and we anticipate somewhat
stronger gains in consumer outlays than previously projected, with some
pick-up in auto sales evident when the new models become available in
the fourth quarter. In real terms, GNP is expected to rise at an
average rate of over 3-1/2 per cent for the two quarters, as compared
with a 3 per cent rate projected in the last Greenbook. This rate of
growth would be somewhat below the continuing growth in our long run
potential, and thus implies some further increase in unemployment beyond
mid-year. Nevertheless, recent price and wage changes suggest that
only moderate progress can be anticipated on the price front; the GNP
deflator is projected to still be rising at an annual rate of 3.6 per
cent in the fourth quarter.
Industrial production. Industrial production is tentatively
estimated to have increased by about one point in January to around 165
per cent, 5.5 per cent below the July 1969 peak and up 2 per cent from
the November low. The January gain in output is centered in steel and
motor vehicles and parts as changes in output in other sectors were
apparently offsetting. (A better estimate of the production index may
be available in time for the Supplement.)
Auto assemblies in January were at an annual rate of 8.3 million
units (preliminary), up 18 per cent from December. Production schedules
for February, which earlier had been set at a 9.8 million unit rate, have
been cut back to a 9.2 million rate. In early January, production of

II -8
television sets and room air conditioners were reduced sharply, a
development in line with reported plant shutdowns and layoffs in
order to bring inventories into better balance with final takings.
Output of furniture and apparel is expected to have changed little
and production of consumer staples probably showed its usual rise.
It is estimated that production of industrial, defense, and
farm equipment (because of a strike at International Harvester) and
commercial aircraft declined. Output of commercial equipment probably
showed little change and truck production recovered further from the
effects of the GM strike.
Among industrial materials,output of steel and auto and
truck parts rose further. Production of most other materials--nonferrous
metals, construction and equipment materials, and textiles, paper, and
industrial chemicals--are estimated to have changed little.
In the first half of 1968, when there was a threat of a steel
strike and when economic activity was advancing rapidly, steel production
rose 10.5 per cent from January to June and accounted for .8 of a point
of the 4-1/2 points rise in the total index. The build-up of stocks
of steel mill products that is anticipated between now and July is likely
to have about the same impact on the total index as it did in 1968.
Retail sales. January retail sales are estimated to have
increased about 1-1/2 per cent from December, reflecting almost entirely
the post-strike rebound in auto sales. Sales of nondurable goods
apparently were little changed and were somewhat above the advanced
fourth quarter level. General merchandise, gasoline stations, and the

II -9
food group showed increases, while sales of apparel and drug stores
declined. Total retail sales in January are estimated 3.5 per cent
higher than a year earlier, suggesting no growth after allowance for
price increases.

Consumer credit. The decline last year in new car sales,
and the accompanying decrease in the volume of auto credit, has
raised the possibility of a lengthening of the typical financing
period for new cars to 42 or even 48 months. Any such move would
represent a sharp departure from present practice. During 1970
approximately 84 per cent of finance company contracts and 83 per
cent of bank purchased paper agreements were for 31-36 months--only
1 per cent of new car contracts had maturities over 36 months.

II -10
Auto dealer organizations that have expressed favor for
extended-maturity financing cite resistance to increased car prices
as a depressant on sales. They indicate a special desire to hold
monthly payments for full-size vehicles at a manageable level for
consumers. The average monthly payment on new car contracts acquired
during 1970 by a large captive finance company (GMAC) is estimated at
$108.29, an increase of $21.25 or 24 per cent since 1965. For all
lenders--banks, finance companies, credit unions, etc.--average notes
for new cars were relatively unchanged at about $3,200 (seasonally
adjusted) from the fall of 1969 until the past summer. However, because
of a substantially higher proportion of sales of domestic compact units
and imported cars, they have recently declined to about $3,130. GMAC
notes have slipped to about $3,520 from a peak above $3,600.
Many of the major independent finance companies forsook
car financing last year because of competitive factors and the high
cost of money. One company (Associates) has indicated that 48-month
paper might prompt consideration about re-entering the auto picture;
another (CCC) stated it would not favor 48-month financing if it were
still in the car financing business and that it would not move back into
the field at present. While the three large captive companies have
already professed opposition to extended terms, it is admitted that
competitive pressures might necessitate acceptance.

II -11
At least one bank (the American Bank of Jacksonville), however,
after a review of the price structure of 1971 models and an analysis of
collateral values, decided to offer 48-month financing on full size
domestic models during the first 6 months of the model year.
Most commercial banks are taking a "wait-and-see" posture,
with some indication that higher downpayments would be required on
longer-term contracts.
Consumer surveys. The latest Conference Board and Census
Bureau reports indicate that consumer expectations for the future
were on balance little changed from the relatively low levels of the
previous surveys, although more respondents expected income increases
most recently. The Conference Board also found more favorable expecta-
tions for business conditions in the next six months. On the other
hand, the Conference Board Survey indicated a more pessimistic evalua-
tion of present business and employment conditions and the Census survey
showed a further deterioration in consumer appraisals of recent current
income experience.
Actual buying plans, as opposed to general economic expectations,
are somewhat inconsistent in the two surveys. The Conference Board
survey in November-December 1970 reported fewer plans to buy autos and
homes in the next six months compared with plans in September-October
and a year earlier. Plans to purchase major appliances were virtually
unchanged from September-October and below a year earlier. Census, on
the other hand, reported January buying plans for houses little changed
from October, but--as they were in the previous survey--higher than a
year earlier.

II -12
The Census survey also indicated a strong improvement in
buying intentions for autos. The seasonally adjusted index of auto
buying plans for all households rose from 103.8 (January-April 1967 = 100)
in the October survey to 107.9 in January compared with 106.0 a year
earlier. This improvement, however, may largely reflect deferred purchases
from the GM strike period, since all of the increase in the index is
attributable to a sharp rise in plans to purchase within the next six
months. Purchase plans for new cars in both the next 12 months and the
next 24 months declined.

Construction and real estate. Seasonally adjusted value
of new construction edged higher in January, following a 2 per cent
upward revision for December. The rate in January--at $94.9 billion--
was 2 per cent above the earlier peak reached in April of 1969.
Outlays for private nonresidential construction in January
were below their level for 1970 as a whole. Outlays for public
construction--mainly State and local projects--also continued lethargic
in January, and were substantially below a year earlier in terms of
constant dollars. By contrast, residential outlays, which have
dominated the uptrend in total construction in recent months, were
considerably above a year earlier in both real and current dollars.
A factor in the rise of residential building has been the greater
concentration by builders on smaller and less expensive units, a
tendency discussed further in Appendix A.

Private housing starts ended the year on a vigorous note,

average was two-fifths above its recent low in the first quarter of
1970 and moderately above the recent high reached in the first quarter
of 1969. Part of the December rise may reflect seasonal adjustment
problems which are difficult to resolve for the winter months when
unadjusted housing starts are at their seasonal low. An important
part, however, would appear to reflect an extraordinary contra-seasonal
upsurge in the Government-assisted sector, especially in the FHA-insured
subsidized portion. Subsidized starts, which expanded considerably last
year, are discussed in Appendix A. Such starts under all major programs
are indicated to have accounted for an unprecedented 60 per cent of
total unadjusted private housing starts in December.

Underscoring the basic underlying strength of shelter require-
ments, rental vacancy rates in the fourth quarter of last year continued
at a reduced average of 4.8 per cent of units available and fit for use,
with very little change from the fourth quarter of other recent years.
While there was some rise from earlier levels, in the West, where lay-
offs in aerospace and defense industries have been large, the latest rate
there was still quite low. Vacancy rates for homeowner units in the
fourth quarter of last year also remained exceptionally low nationally
(1.0 per cent).

Cyclical indicators. The leading indicator composite rose
1.4 per cent in December, following a smaller increase in November.
The increase came both from series directly affected by the end of the
GM strike and the beginning of steel stockpiling and from series not so

II -19
affected. In the latter group, increases in building permits for
private housing and common stock prices outweighed declines in industrial
materials prices and contracts and orders for plant and equipment. Upward
influences from three strike-affected series--the manufacturing workweek,
initial unemployment claims, and new orders for durable goods--were to
a considerable extent offset by a sharp decline in the ratio of price
to unit labor costs, which apparently reflected extra labor costs in
starting up production at GM plants. In January, common stock prices
rose further and industrial materials prices declined further.
The coincident composite also rose in December following the
end of the GM strike. The lagging composite declined.

Manufacturers' orders and shipments. New orders for durable
goods rose 3.6 per cent--$l billion--in December, according to preliminary
data. The principal factor in the increase was a $1.2 billion rise in
motor vehicle industry orders, reflecting the sharp rebound as GM
production was resumed. A large increase was also reported in iron and
steel orders which probably reflected both the end of the GM strike
and anticipation of steel price increases and a possible strike in 1971.
New orders for durable goods other than steel and autos were down 2.8
per cent.
The December increase followed two months in which new orders
for durable goods were depressed by the strike. The average new order
level in the fourth quarter declined 4-1/2 per cent, after two quarters
of increase, and was back to around the low rate of the first quarter
of 1970. Motor vehicles and steel fell 16 per cent while orders to
other industries were down 1.5 per cent from the third to the fourth
quarter.
Capital equipment orders dropped back sharply in December
to around the September rate, reflecting declines in ship and rail
equipment, aircraft, and nonelectrical machinery. But on a quarterly
average basis, capital equipment orders have increased steadily from the
low in the second quarter of 1970--and by slightly more than the rate
of price increase for machinery and equipment. In the fourth quarter,
however, they were still 2.4 per cent below a year earlier in current
dollars--6.6 per cent in real terms.

Orders for nondurable goods rose in December and were back
at the October level.

Shipments of durable goods rose 3.1 per cent in December,
with autos the principal stimulus. The backlog of unfilled orders
rose slightly further--the second month of increase--with increases
at iron and steel and communications equipment industries largely
offset by declines elsewhere.
Manufacturers' inventories. Book value of manufacturers'
inventories declined at a $4 billion annual rate in December, with
decreases in both durable and nondurable goods industries. The decline
followed two months of substantial increases, and for the quarter as a
whole book values were up at a $4.2 billion rate, about the same as the
third quarter rate.

II -22
The greatest part of the December decline in durable goods
stocks occurred in defense products and in construction materials
industries, especially fabricated metal products. Inventories also
declined somewhat at steel mills with the end of the GM strike and
an increased outflow of shipments. Capital equipment inventories,
however, increased at a $2.4 billion annual rate. Materials and
in-process inventories declined while stocks of durable finished
goods continued to rise, especially in machinery industries.

Labor market. Employment and unemployment estimates for
January are not yet available, but the employment situation does not
appear to have changed appreciably over the month. Insured unemployment
(seasonally adjusted) for the first three weeks of January averaged some-
what less than in December. This modest further decline is probably due
to the continuing rebound from the General Motors strike, some steel
inventory building, and seasonal adjustment problems. Initial claims
for jobless benefits have shown signs of another upturn in recent weeks
and appear likely to be higher in January than in December.

Labor force in 1970. Slack demand was reflected in much
slower growth of the total labor force in 1970 than in 1969. The
total labor force rose only 1.3 million in the year ending in the
fourth quarter of 1970 contrasted with 2.3 million in the prior year.
The slower growth occurred primarily among teenagers and women, groups
whose decisions to seek work are often influenced by demand conditions.
Total labor force growth for men was near the 1969 rate.

Reflecting a cut of 440,000 in the Armed Forces, growth
in the civilian work force was larger than for the total--1.8 million
in 1970. The civilian work force of men aged 20 years and over rose
by over 800,000, one of the largest increases of the post-war period
and doubtlessly an important factor in the doubling of the adult male
unemployment rate over the past year.
On the basis of growth of working age population and trends
in participation rates the civilian labor force would be expected to
rise by over 1.5 million during 1971. However, with the labor market
likely to continue slack, labor force increases for women and teenagers
may be smaller than normally expected. Among men, however, the normal

II -26
rise of about half a million is likely to be realized-reflecting the
pressures of family responsibilities and a high propensity to seek work
regardless of economic conditions--and is expected to be supplemented
by further Armed Forces reductions of perhaps 300,000. This large
addition to the civilian work force from the Armed Forces--which would
boost the total increase for this age group to about 800,000--will be
difficult to absorb quickly in a sluggish economy and unemployment rates
for men may rise further in 1971 if our output projections are realized.
Collective bargaining. Wage and benefit increases provided
by contracts concluded in the fourth quarter of 1970 were somewhat
smaller than in the previous nine-month period. However, the extent
of slowing is overstated in the Bureau of Labor Statistics contract
cost estimates because the BLS figures exclude wage increases that are
clearly identified as cost-of-living increases. (Technically this is
done because the BLS cannot foresee the rate of rise of consumer prices.)
Normally, wage settlements do not indicate the specific amount considered
a "catch-up" for past price increases. However, the auto settlement,
which applied to about one-third of all workers covered by wage settlements
concluded during the fourth quarter, specifically allowed a 26-cent
increase based on past price rises. Thus, while the auto workers actually
received a first year wage increase of 12-1/2 per cent, the BLS calculations
only included about half of that amount--the portion that was not designated
as a cost-of-living increase. This was the major factor in reducing the

II -27
rise in first-year wage costs from an average of 8.5 per cent in
manufacturing in the first nine months of 1970 to 7.1 per cent for
the fourth quarter. Adding the cost-of-living increase back it would
raise the first-year figure above 9 per cent.

In nonmanufacturing, first-year wage increases did ease wome-
what, in part reflecting the tapering off in the number of workers
covered by negotiations in the construction industry. Wage rates
advanced much more rapidly in nonmanufacturing than in manufacturing
during 1970; averaged over the life of the contract, wage increases
were 11.5 per cent annually for nonmanufacturing compared with 6.0 per
cent in manufacturing.

II -28
Evidence continues to accumulate that wage pressures are
easing somewhat in the nonunion sectors of the economy. In manufacturing
establishments only 37 per cent of nonunion workers received wage rate
increases in the first nine months of 1970 compared with 67 per cent in
the corresponding months of 1969. Average wage increases received by
nonunion workers in each of the two periods were the same--5.8 per cent--
but because the number of workers receiving increases was almost cut in
half, the average wage adjustment (based on all nonunion workers whether
or not they received increases) was smaller in 1970 than in 1969.
Increases in average hourly earnings in trade and finance have also slowed
in recent months compared with over-the-year rises in 1969.
Wholesale prices. Wholesale prices rose at an estimated
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.7 per cent in January (December 15th
to January 12th) largely as a result of sharp increases in prices of
farm and food products. Prices for industrial commodities increased at
a much lower rate, the smallest monthly change--with the exception of
last November when no change was posted--since mid-1969.

Widespread increases in prices of industrial commodities in
January were led by nonmetallic minerals (mainly building materials).
Increases for fuels and power and machinery and equipment were substantial,
but considerably smaller than in recent months. Prices for motor vehicles
and parts were again raised in a "second round" of increases and lumber
and wood products prices rose as sizes of lumber were reduced under new
voluntary softwood standards adopted by the industry. In the metals index,
increases for steel scrap and some other steel and manufactured metal
products more than offset further declines in nonferrous metals.Dec 1970

The January rise in metal products followed a period of declining
prices in the second half of 1970. But the increase in the industrial
commodities average from June to December 1970 was maintained at a rate
of 3-1/2 per cent--almost as high as in the first half--as the rise in
fuel prices and utility accelerated rates and as automobile and other
transportation equipment and machinery prices rose strongly. These groups
have a heavy weight in the index, and together they accounted for most of
the continued uptrend in industrial prices. Prices of crude materials
were weak and declining but of major industrial groups only pulp, paper
and allied products leveled off in the second half and only lumber and
wood products and textiles--in addition to metals--declined.June 1970

Although the slackening in the increase in fuel prices in
January is encouraging, the long-term outlook is for further increases,
especially for natural gas and electric power. Price rises are still
being announced for petroleum products and prices of coal are under
upward pressure owing to increased costs of mining, partly as a result
of new safety standards.
Steel price increases, already announced to be effective
March 1, will raise the metals price index by about .2 per cent but
will have only a slight effect on the index of all industrial commodities.

Consumer prices. Consumer prices rose at a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of about 6-1/2 per cent in December as food and
gasoline prices reversed their previous declines and new car and
household service prices rose sharply. Although the December advance
was among the largest this year, the rise of 5.5 per cent from December
1969 was smaller than that of the preceding year, and there was some
slowing in the rate of price increase between the first and second
half of the year.

The December advance in food prices brought the cost of
food to its high point for the year, but only about 2 per cent above a
year earlier. Increases for eggs, cereal and bakery and dairy products,
fish and poultry outweighed reductions in beef, pork and fresh fruits.
Among other nondurables, a notable slowing in the rise of apparel

II- 33
prices was more than offset by an increase for gasoline as "price
wars" ended in several areas.
Additional price increases for new cars and the strike-
induced delay in the shift to 1971 models (new car prices usually
decline in December) caused a sharp rise in the index for durable
goods. Household durables price increases, however, slowed to an
annual rate of 1.1 per cent after two months at 4.5 per cent.
The 7 per cent annual rate of increase in service costs was
paced by household services, with sharp advances in residential
property taxes, insurance, and home maintenance costs. Mortgage
interest costs also rose despite unchanged interest rates because of
the continued advance in home prices. Utility rates climbed sharply
and rents continued to accelerate, reflecting in part the upward
adjustment of rents in the New York City area. Medical care costs
also continued to rise rapidly.
Six-month changes in the consumer price index show a peak
rate in the first half of 1969 and some slowing since, particularly
in the second half of 1970. The major contributing factor to the
slowing was the leveling off in food prices which started in the
second quarter of last year; in December the price of food at home
was below the May level. Total food costs rose slightly from May to
December, because of the continued advance in restaurant prices; the
pace for the latter has moderated since mid-year.
Durable goods price increases accelerated in the second
half of 1970 as the 1971 model cars were introduced. (The acceleration

II-34
is partly masked by movements in used car and house prices but appears
clearly in the series excluding these items.) Over the year new car
prices rose about 6-1/2 per cent, more than twice as much as in any
year in the previous decade. House prices rose at peak rates of 8-9
per cent from mid-1969 through the third quarter of 1970, but appear
to have slowed substantially in the last quarter.
The rise in service costs slowed after the first quarter of
1970, when home finance costs were climbing at near-record rates, but
shows no further signs of slowing down. Medical service costs continue
their rapid advance and major household service prices, including rents,
gas and electricity, accelerated in the last quarter.
Although trends in nondurables excluding food are obscured
by fluctuations in gasoline prices, no slowing down is apparent.
However, apparel prices, despite four months of substantial increase,
are not rising as fast as the peak rates of 1968.

Price indexes for the GNP. In the fourth quarter of 1970 the
increase in the GNP implicit deflator accelerated to annual rate of
5.7 per cent (preliminary estimate) from 4.6 per cent in the third
quarter. Much of the acceleration reflected a shift in the composition
of output (i.e., changing weights). However, both a fixed-weighted
index for GNP components and a chain-weighted index (in which the
weights are based on the composition of output in the first of the
quarters to be compared) also show a faster rate of rise in the closing
period of the year than in the previous quarter.
The fixed-weighted index for gross private product--which
excludes the effects of both shifts in weights and government salary
increases--reached a peak rate of increase of over 5 per cent around
mid-1969. Since then the index has increased at a somewhat slower rate,
except for the return to 5 per cent each quarter.
Much of the acceleration in the implicit deflator for GNP
last quarter derived from the sharp rise in the deflator for personal
consumption expenditures--from an annual rate of 3.9 per cent in the
third quarter to 5.7 per cent in the fourth quarter. About half of this
acceleration can be attributed to shifts in weights, as the fixed-
weighted index for PCE shows a fourth-quarter annual rate of increase
of 4.8 per cent compared with 3.9 per cent in the third quarter.

The rise in the deflator for fixed investment level off in the
fourth quarter of last year at a rate of about 7 per cent annually, but
a fixed-weight index indicates some slowing between the third and fourth
quarters as a more moderate rise in construction costs more than off-
set an accelerated increase in prices of producers' equipment. In both
the Federal and State and local government sectors, the rise in the
deflator slowed in late 1970.
The CPI and the consumer expenditure deflator. The deflator
for consumer expenditures has been rising at a lower rate than the con-
sumer price index for some time, reflecting in large part differences in
coverage but also different weights. The CPI durables component includes
a series for "home purchase"--prices of new and used homes--which has
been rising more rapidly in recent years than prices of other durable
goods. In addition, prices of used cars are included in the CPI but
are excluded from the deflator. Largely because of these differences
in composition, new car prices,(which until recently have increased less
than most commodities) are more heavily-weighted in the deflator than
in the CPI and this accounts in part for its more moderate rate of rise.
The inclusion of home finance costs in the CPI contributed to
the rapid rise in the costs of services in 1969 and early 1970. Costs
of maintenance and other outlays by homeowners have also been a factor in
the relatively fast acceleration of service costs in the CPI. In the
deflator, the rent index, which climbs more slowly, is used to measure
space-rent services for both owners and renters.

II-38
Although the recent downtrend in mortgage interest rates has
been a moderating influence on the rise in the CPI, and should continue
to be, a continued brisk rise in the price of homes and in costs asso-
ciated with home ownership will probably cause the CPI service component
to continue to increase faster this year than the consumer expenditure
deflator.

of the special survey revealed national planting plans not greatly
different from traditional patterns and remarkably close to Department
of Agriculture goals. As a result, final provisions of the 1971 programs,
soon to be announced, will probably differ little from those announced
in early December.
Corn poses the most acute question in 1971 production because
of the threat of short supplies to the livestock industry. The survey
indicates that a 6 per cent increase in plantings over 1970 is planned.
The greatest expansion is planned in the Western Corn Belt and in other
areas with little or not blight damage in 1970 and supplies of seed are
more than ample for such expansion. In the Eastern Corn Belt and the
South where damage was severe last year, smaller increases or actual
decreases are planned. Supplies of resistant and blend seed will be a
constraint on acreages planted. Larger acreages of soybeans and other
feed grains are planned in these areas. Shifts from corn will be limited
by the greater relative profitability of corn, assuming normal yields,
and by the fact that much land in corn last year contains residual
chemicals inimical to soybeans.
Some analysts feel that farmers were polled in the January survey
before they fully understood the new cropping options open to them and before
many of them were aware of the shortages of supplies of suitable corn seed
in prospect in certain areas. The regular mid-March planting intentions
survey may well reveal more marked reactions both to the blight threat
and to the new planting rules than those indicated on January 1.

THE ECONOMIC PICTURE IN DETAIL
Domestic Financial Situation
Monetary aggregates. The narrowly defined money stock (M1)
appears to have increased at an annual rate of about 3 per cent in
January, about half the rate in December. A weakening in private demand
deposit expansion was responsible for this slowdown, with public currency
holdings continuing to rise at about the strong pace of other recent
months. Growth in M2 (M1 plus commercial bank time deposits other than
large CD's), at an annual rate of 12.5 per cent, was just slightly below
the December rate of advance, as a stepup in the expansion of the time
and savings deposit component of this measure compensated for slower
growth in demand deposits.
An increased rate of growth of consumer-type deposits was
primarily responsible for the strengthening in the time deposit compon-
ent of M2.In addition, there was a continued large inflow of state
and local deposits that took the form of time deposits other than large
CD's. In contrast to developments in these deposits, growth in large
CD's dropped fairly substantially--although, even at this reduced rate,
the inflows were still relatively large by historical standards--and
this pulled the rate of growth in total time and savings deposits below
that for December.
The slowdown in CD growth may reflect bank decisions to seek
these deposits less aggressively, CD offering rates were reduced sharply
during the month, from 5.50 per cent to 4.50 per cent for 60 to 89 day

III -2
maturities, for example. However, the reductions in bank CD rates were
roughly matched by declines in other money market rates--for example,
rates on 30 to 89 day finance company paper declined from 5.38 per cent
to 4.25 per cent. There have also been numerous reports that banks
have been lowering their offering rates on consumer-type time deposits.
For the most part, these reductions have been accomplished by eliminat-
ing longer-term, higher-rate certificates, but in some cases the minimum
required deposit has been raised. In addition, one major bank in the
East has lowered its rate on passbook savings accounts to 4 per cent
from 4-1/2 per cent.
The adjusted credit proxy also advanced at a somewhat slower
rate in January than in December, reflecting a decline in U.S. Treasury
deposits as well as the slower growth in private deposits. Bank borrow-
ing from foreign branches declined at a faster pace than in other recent
months, the increase in the attrition in part reflecting the reduction
in liabilities to foreign branches that took place in conjunction with
foreign branch acquisitions of $1 billion in Export-Import Bank certif-
icates. On the other hand, declines in commercial paper liabilities of
affiliates diminished to some extent.

Bank credit. Commercial bank credit, adjusted for transfers
of loans between banks and their affiliates, is estimated to have
increased at an annual rate of 12.7 per cent in January, slightly above
December's rate of expansion and more than double that for the fourth
quarter. As in other recent months, security acquisitions accounted
for the bulk of this increase, but some acceleration in the rate of
loan expansion was also recorded.
U.S. Treasury securities were acquired in substantial volume
in January, as in December. A major part of the increase in holdings
of these issues was in notes and bonds with less than one year to

III -4
maturity. This apparently reflected bank acquisition of rights to be
exchanged in the Treasury's forthcoming refinancing. Holdings of
Treasury bills also were increased, while notes and bonds with over a
year to maturity were reduced. Holdings of other securities also
expanded sharply in January, almost matching the exceptionally large
increases of November and December. Most of this growth was in State
and local securities, with a fairly large share of these acquisitions
in issues with intermediate and longer-term maturity dates.
Growth in total loans, adjusted for loan transfers, in
January was at an annual rate of slightly more than 3.5 per cent.
Business loans are estimated to have risen appreciably while moderate
increases apparently occurred in loans to nonbank financial institutions
and in real estate loans. Other loan categories remained unchanged or
declined slightly.
The advance in adjusted business loans in January, at an
annual rate of 7.6 per cent, reversed a four month period of reduction
in which these loans declined at an average annual rate of 8.9 per cent.
Public utilities accounted for a large share of the January advance,
but loans to firms in several other industries, particularly chemicals
and construction, also appeared fairly strong. The pickup in business
loan demand may have been associated in part with the post auto-strike
recovery in business activity. In addition, loan repayments out of the
proceeds of capital market financing are believed to have fallen off
substantially in January. Loan growth may also have been stimulated by
the cut in bank prime rates to 6 per cent early in the month. The

III -5
improved competitive position that banks gained with this reduction,
however, was eroded during the month as commercial paper rates declined
further. At month end, the differential between the prime rate and
these open market rates was wider than before the prime rate cut.
In part, the January increase may reflect technical window-
dressing adjustments affecting both December and January that are
difficult to allow for in the seasonal adjustment procedures. For the
two months taken together, business loans adjusted show essentially no
growth as compared to the sharp declines of the previous three months.
The increase in real estate loans amounted to about $400
million (seasonally adjusted), roughly the same as that in December and
somewhat more than in earlier months. These latest increases highlight
the gradual increase in flows of bank funds into the mortgage market
that has been in progress since about the middle of last year. During
the seven month period ending in January of this year it is estimated
that banks increased their holdings of mortgages by about $1.5 billion,
substantially more than in the first half of 1970 when there was very
little growth.

Nonbank depositary intermediaries. Deposit inflows to thrift
institutions during the first half of January were exceptionally strong.
At S&L's, they not only exceeded by a wide margin the previous record
inflow for the entire month but they may well exceed the record growth
rate for any month since at least 1955.1/ The liquidity and safety of
thrift institution claims have apparently continued to appeal to
consumers in the face of uncertain employment prospects. Moreover, the
decline in market interest rates during the past two months has dramati-
cally enhanced the attractiveness of these claims from a yield standpoint,

Given the recent exceptionally strong deposit growth, it
would not be surprising if thrift institutions were to drop their
offering rates below deposit ceiling rates now generally prevailing,
particularly in light of indications that S&L funds could not quickly
be converted into new mortgage loans--apparently even at recently
liberalized mortgage terms and rates. As with some recent commercial
bank actions, rate cutting might initially take the form of larger
minimum deposits required on longer term accounts, or even cessation
of offering such accounts.

III -8
During the fourth quarter, savings and loan associations
acquired an exceptionally large volume of liquid assets. To some
extent this undoubtedly constituted an intentional rebuilding of oper-
ating liquidity, including liquidity needed to meet forthcoming mortgage
commitment takedowns. But in addition, it may partly reflect a lack of
sufficiently high-yielding alternative long-term outlets available
currently or in the near future. The extraordinary efforts of S&L's to
acquire mortgages are indicated by the unusually large volume of loans
purchased, apparently from warehousing arrangements of mortgage com-
panies, as shown in the last line of the table below. To the extent
that liquidity has been expanded because of a scarcity of mortgages,
pressure can be expected to develop not only to stem inflows by reduc-
ing offering rates but also to repay outstanding Federal Home Loan Bank
advances.

Greater fund inflows were not used to reduce borrowing during
the fourth quarter because associations had contractually agreed to
keep a large share of their FHLB advances outstanding for a one-year
period that began in the spring of 1970. Nearly $3.5 billion of those
loans mature in April, and another $3 billion mature in May and June.
The current cost of these advances is over 7 per cent which, while a

III -10
subsidized rate, now looms exceptionally high in relation to the huge
volume of funds associations have attracted from consumers at no more
than 6 per cent. Incomplete responses to a FHLBB query on present plans
tentatively suggest that S&L's might repay about one third of the
outstanding FHLB advances. The prospect of large repayments of such
advances suggests that not all of the resurgence in deposit inflows will
result in an easing of home mortgage conditions.
Mortgage market. With deposit flows to thrift institutions
continuing large into January, and demands for mortgage credit season-
ally slack, field reports and trade opinion indicate that the availability
of residential mortgage credit improved further and that mortgage rates
continued under considerable downward pressure. Following some reduction
during November and December in average interest rates on conventional
home mortgages, cuts of as much as 1/4 to 1/2 per cent were made in many
areas during January, judging from a spot survey of representative
lenders conducted late last month by the Federal Reserve Banks. Rate
declines were even posted last month in several States where restrictive
usury ceilings had formerly kept rates from rising as much as they did
in other areas. Meanwhile, respondents indicated that expectations of
additional reductions were causing numerous would-be borrowers to hold
back. A minority of the lenders interviewed reported limited increases
in typical loan-to-value ratios as well, although average dollar down-
payments remained quite high on homes purchased with conventional
mortgages.

III -11
On FHA and VA mortgages, which have accounted for a growing
share of all housing finance in recent quarters, contract rates were
cut 1/2 of 1 per cent by administrative action announced January 12,
following a similar reduction made early in December. This action
brought the nominal rate on these Government underwritten loans down to
7-1/2 per cent, the lowest level in a year. Since then, further easing
in market conditions has given rise to widespread trade expectations of
another rate reduction before long. Based on the small volume of bids
involved in FNMA's January 25 auction of forward commitments to purchase
Government underwritten mortgages, yields on 6-month commitments declined
to 7.97 per cent--39 basis points below the level prevailing in late
December and 136 basis points below the peak reached in mid-1970. While
results of the FHA conventional home-mortgage rate survey are not yet
available for January, they are expected to show an unusually large
decline.

Indicative of the improved flow of funds from private lenders
into residential mortgages has been the strong market reception accorded
3 auctions held by FNMA last month to sell limited amounts of FHA and VA
mortgages out of its portfolio. Taking advantage of the improved tone
of the market during January, FNMA agreed to sell off a larger dollar
volume of home loans ($104 million) than it committed to purchase ($36
million). In addition, GNMA in recent weeks has received a sharply
increased number of applications to insure proposed issues of pass-
through participations in pools of Government-backed mortgages. Under
this program, which began early last year, a total of $1.6 billion in
such applications had been received through late January, and $534
million in pass-through participations had been sold. Although the
program was designed to broaden sources of funds for the mortgage market,
the principal buyers of these participations to date have been savings
and loan associations and savings banks--together accounting for two-
thirds of total dollar purchases--which would be in the mortgage market
in any case.
Improvement in the availability of mortgage credit during
the fourth quarter of 1970 was reflected in a further pick-up in growth
of total mortgage debt outstanding. The seasonally adjusted annual
rate of net increase in such debt reached $29-1/2 billion, two-fifths
above the recent low in the first quarter of last year, with residential
mortgage debt expanding at an advanced $22-1/2 billion annual rate.
Most net expansion in holdings of outstanding residential mortgage -debt
continued to be accounted for by savings and loan associations.

III -13
Life insurance companies. Demand for policy loans from life
insurance companies slackened considerably during the fourth quarter
as market interest rates and general credit conditions eased. Mainten-
ance of current easier credit conditions can also be expected to be
associated with an increase in loanable funds through larger portfolio
return flows and insurance-related sources of funds. It may be indica-
tive of expected increased fund flows that during December new commit-
ments for corporate direct placements increased sharply, amounting to
over $300 million for the first time since July 1969.

Corporate and municipal securities markets. Yields on
corporate and municipal securities, on balance, continued their sharp
decline in January, despite some initial investor resistance to lower
yields early in the month. Further declines in money market rates, the
continued weakness in the economy and a stepped-up pace of institutional
investment contributed to the January decline. However, extremely
aggressive pricing of new issues by investment bankers late in January
led to investor resistance and a build-up of dealer positions. A large
volume of new offerings in the tax-exempt market also resulted in mount-
ing inventories in that area, as well as some increase in yields later
in the month.

Public bond offerings by corporations in January were about
$2.1 billion, off slightly from the December pace, as some industrial
firms delayed financing plans, apparently in hope of still further
declines in new issue yields.1/ Offerings by financial firms picked
up significantly in January, however, and utility bond sales remained
high. New stock offerings and takedowns of private placements in
January appeared to be somewhat below the level of average monthly
volume in 1970.

Underwriters report that filings of bond issues by industrial
companies will increase in the next 30 days, and the staff estimates
that corporate public bond sales will exceed $2 billion a month in
February and March. The forward calendar of equity offerings is already
beginning to build up, but an increase in private placement takedowns
will probably not be evident until later in the year since the increase
in new commitments began only recently.
Long-term debt offerings by State and local governments set
a postwar record of over $2.6 billion in January. An unusual supply of
negotiated issues, including a $250 million New York State Urban Develop-
ment bond, contributed to the huge total. While the volume of negotiated
issues is not expected to be so large in the immediate future, the staff
does expect tax-exempt offerings to continue at a monthly average rate
in excess of $2 billion.

Bank acquisitions have been particularly heavy in the short-
term end of the tax-exempt market--notes and early serial bond maturi-
ties--but banks have also been broadening the maturity range of their
purchases. This support by the banking system enabled the tax-exempt
market to absorb, at declining yields, an unusually heavy volume over
the past few months. If business loan demand picks up later in this
quarter, however, the pace of commercial bank buying will undoubtedly
moderate. Although some increase in acquisitions by casualty insurance
companies and mutual savings banks is expected in the quarter, it would
be only a partial offset to the potential decline in bank buying.
Stock market. Recent sharp declines in long-term interest
rates have made bond investments much less attractive relative to common
stocks than has been the case in more than a year, especially when the
return from both investments is viewed as the combination of current

III -18
yield and potential expected capital gain. To be sure, bond yields
remain well in excess of dividend yields on stocks. But investors have
apparently adopted a favorable view toward the prospects for sustained
price appreciation in equities, with many apparently also concluding that
near-term interest rate declines are unlikely to be sufficient to create
comparable gains from investment in bonds. The effect of a resulting
shift in investor interest from bonds back to stocks, combined with the
impact of reentry into the market of institutional and individual
investors who have been on the sidelines for the past six months to two
years, has been a sharp increase in stock trading volume and a sustained
advance in stock prices generally.
Since mid-November, the NYSE Index has risen more than 15 per
cent and the AMEX Index approximately 13 per cent. While still well
below their all-time high levels of 1968, the NYSE and AMEX indices are
respectively about 40 and 25 per cent above their lows of May 1970.
Contrary to the speculative appearance of these substantial price
increases, the emphasis placed on quality issues in the equity market
in recent months appears to be persisting.
Trading volume, which averaged about 11 million shares per
day on the NYSE during November--and 11.6 million shares for 1970 as a
whole--rose to an average of more than 15 million shares in December
and a record 17.4 million shares in January. Reflecting increased
trading and the reemergence of some brokerage back-office delays, fail-
ures to deliver rose nearly 30 per cent during December to an end-of-
month level of $1.4 billion. While a further increase is believed to

III -19
have occurred in January (figures not yet available), fails are still
well below their critical December 1968 peak of $4.1 billion.
Trading by institutional investors in blocks of 10,000 or
more shares has accelerated markedly in the past two months. Relative
to total trading on the NYSE, however, the percentage of large block
trades has remained very close to the 15.4 per cent average for all of
1970. Thus the recent activity in the stock market appears to be
broadly based reflecting the optimism of both institutional and indi-
vidual investors. Judging by past relationships, investors would appear
to be anticipating general recovery in corporate profits in the third or
fourth quarter of 1971.
Among institutional investors, mutual funds were especially
heavy buyers during December; their net common stock purchases of about
$500 million during the month were greater than in any month since
December 1968. Bank trust departments continue to provide a rather
stable source of demand, as they have throughout the past two years.
Insurance companies are reportedly not active in the equity market at
the present time.
Government securities market. Interest rates throughout the
Treasury market dropped markedly over the month of January, reflecting
the same influences at work in corporate and municipal securities
markets. In the coupon area, yield declines ranged from 20 to as much
as 60 basis points. With the further easing of money market conditions
and dealer financing costs, Treasury bill rates also dropped further in

III -20
the latter part of January, bringing the declines for the month as a
whole to some 50 to 75 basis points.

The results of the Treasury February financing operation,
which involved the first major pre-refunding since the summer of 1966,
were generally in line with expectations at the time of the Treasury's
announcement. Of the $19.5 billion of publicly-held "rights", a total
of $10.8 billion were exchanged, with $5.2 billion going into the new
5-7/8%, 4-1/2 year note and $5.6 billion into the 6-1/4%, 7-year issue.

Dealers' positions have increased by $100 million since the
time of the last Committee meeting. Dealer awards of the two new issues
totaled just under $1.1 billion and were about equally divided between
the two notes. Demand for Treasury bills has been quite large, in part
reflecting heavy foreign official purchases; and dealers' bill holdings
have declined on balance since the last meeting despite awards in each
of the last three weekly auctions of around $1.0 billion.

III -22
Other short-term credit markets. During December seasonally
adjusted commercial and finance company paper outstanding rose $857
million to $33.5 billion. Dealer-placed and direct paper rose $1.6
billion, but this was partially offset by a further decline of $777
million in bank-related paper. Bank-related paper continued to decline
through the third week of January, leaving $2.1 billion outstanding.
Despite the turbulence in the commercial paper market in
June-July and the General Motors' strike during the fall, nonbank
commercial and finance company outstandings rose $2.2 billion during
1970. After a rapid increase early in the year, both dealer and
directly-placed paper fell sharply for three months beginning in June
of 1970. Dealer paper has rebounded since August and reached a record
high by year-end. Directly-placed paper, reflecting the GM strike and
the accompanying reduced demand for consumer durables, has regained only
$338 million since August. (See table on the following page.)
Short-term interest rates have fallen since December 30, with
declines ranging from 50 to 125 basis points. The largest decreases
were registered by commercial and finance company paper and certificates
of deposit. Bill rates, which earlier showed a sharp decline, have
recently tended to decline more slowly while other rates have continued
their downward adjustment. The spread between three-month Treasury
bills and certificates of deposit recently was about 40 basis points, a
narrower spread than has prevailed for several years.

Federal finance. Staff projections of budgetary flows have been
reviewed in light of the new Budget and the staff's revised income assump-
tions. For fiscal year 1971, the staff is now projecting a budget deficit
of $18.8 billion, $0.2 billion more than the new Budget estimate for 1971.
The major single difference in the staff assumptions for the current half
year relative to the Budget is a projection of a more generous social secur-
ity bill than the flat 6 per cent increase recommended by the Administration.
However, this is mostly offset by lower staff estimates of expenditures in
other areas based on shortfalls in recent spending patterns relative to
targeted levels (especially in the grants area). On the receipts side,
staff estimates for the current fiscal year come out the same as the Budget
total on a unified budget basis, with lower income assumptions and slightly
higher estimates of marginal tax rates offsetting each other.
With respect to financing requirements, a need for $3 billion of
new borrowing is projected for March and a further $3-4 billion in April.
According to previous Treasury statements, these financings would take the
form of an increase in Treasury bills. The cash borrowing operation that is
assumed for April would likely raise the Treasury debt above its current
statutory ceiling. Moreover, a further borrowing operation seems required
in May.
In view of the sizable maturities of tax anticipation bills during
the remainder of the current fiscal year, Treasury net borrowing in the
current fiscal year, Treasury net borrowing in the current January-June
period would amount to only $1-2 billion. The combined market demands of
the Treasury and Government-sponsored agencies are projected to be at about

III -26
the same level during this half year as they were in the first half of
last year. Agencies are projected to be significant net repayers of debt
in this period, in contrast to their large borrowing last year, whereas
the Treasury, which made sizable net debt repayments last year, will be a
modest net borrower in the current half-year.
An analysis of the budget outlook for fiscal year 1972 is given
in Appendix C.

THE ECONOMIC PICTURE IN DETAIL
International Developments
U. S. balance of payments. Somewhat more complete data for
the overall balances in December comfirm the earlier estimate for the
fourth quarter of a $3.0 billion liquidity deficit (annual rate,
seasonally adjusted, before special transactions), not significantly
different from the third quarter rate. For the year the overall deficit
on this basis was $4.9 billion.

Known transactions in the fourth quarter that were adverse
included the reduction in the trade surplus (discussed below) and a
sharp increase in bank lending in December. Most of the recent outflow
of bank credit seems to have represented borrowing by Japanese banks,
which turned to their U.S. credit lines for funds as interest rates
here declined. The fourth-quarter increase in banking claims was $650
million (seasonally adjusted) following a reduction of $150 million in
the third quarter. The net increase for the year in bank reported
claims -- $810 million -- was the largest since the VFCR was instituted.
However, a sizable part of the reported outflow represented claims
not subject to the VFCR, including claims on Canada and credits under
the Export-Import Bank exemption.
Transactions in securities in the fourth quarter, however,
were more favorable than in the third. Foreign net purchases of U.S.
corporate stocks rose to $200 million in December, as the stock market
advanced, and for the entire fourth quarter net purchases were over
$450 million, somewhat better than the $380 million in the third
quarter. These net purchases compare with net sales of $170 million
in the first half of the year. Net foreign purchases of U.S. corporate
bonds in the fourth quarter were about $250 million -- about the same
as the quarterly average for the year. This includes sales of new issues
abroad to finance direct investments.

IV -3
U.S. net purchases of foreign securities in the fourth
quarter were about $200 million, much less than the sizable outflow
in the preceding quarter. For the year as a whole the outflow to
purchase foreign securities were only about $800 million, compared to
$1.5 billion in 1969.
Partial data for the January liquidity deficit suggest that
it was on the order of $1 billion (before seasonal adjustment or the
second allocation of SDRs). Seasonal adjustments have been disrupted
by the size and variability of year-end window-dressing, but the
unadjusted January deficits have risen steadily since 1967, and last
year the January deficit (comparably defined) was about $800
million. This suggests that the January deficit this year still represents
a very large underlying deficit. In the last days of the month, a
$200 million IBRD medium-term bond issue was sold to U.S. banks, but
the proceeds were largely invested in non-liquid assets.
The size of the official settlements deficit for January
is not clear at this time; the available weekly data and reported
reserve gains of other countries suggest that it was quite large but
less than the fourth-quarter rate.
U.S. foreign trade. The export surplus in December 1970
was $1.4 billion at a seasonally adjusted annual rate, balance-of-
payments basis, compared with a small deficit ($0.4 billion) in November.

IV -4
In the fourth quarter, the surplus ran at an annual rate of only $0.6
billion, down sharply from the $2.9 billion third-quarter rate. This
sizable reduction in the surplus resulted from a moderate decline in
exports and a substantial rise in imports. The GM strike and the
continued easing of tight supply conditions among steel producers in
Western Europe both affected the balance adversely. The decline in
exports of machinery and the rise in imports of petroleum were also
contributing factors.
For the year 1970 as a whole, gains in exports outstripped
gains in imports, and the surplus rose to about $2.2 billion from the
low $0.6 billion levels recorded in both 1968 and 1969. Most of the
improvement in 1970 occurred in the first half of the year; the monthly
surpluses reached a peak at mid-year and then declined steadily until
December.

For 1971, a somewhat smaller trade surplus than in 1970 is in
prospect. Demand for exports may be dempened as a result of less
buoyant economic activity abroad, while imports are expected to increase
as a result of rising demand in the United States.
The U.S. bilateral trade balances with Canada, Western Europe,
and Japan deteriorated in the fourth quarter of 1970. The balance
with Canada worsened by $1.7 billion -- partly because of the GM strike --
and accounted for about three-fourths of the total decline in the U.S.
export surplus in that quarter. The deterioration in the balance
with Western Europe was wholly the result of increasesin imports; exports
to Western Europe remained unchanged between the third and fourth quarters.
For the year 1970, the U.S. bilateral trade balances with all major
areas -- except Canada -- improved.

Exports in the fourth quarter of 1970 were $41.7 billion
at a seasonally adjusted annual rate, balance-of-payments basis,
2.3 per cent below the third quarter. For 1970 as a whole, exports
were $42.0 billion, an increase of over 15 per cent from the strike-
depressed $36.5 billion level of a year earlier. Roughly a third of
this increase in the value of 1970 exports represented price rises
(measured by unit values).
Exports of agricultural commodities -- especially wheat, corn,
cotton, rice, and tobacco -- made further substantial gains in the last
quarter of 1970. For the entire year, agricultural exports reached a
record high of $7.3 billion, up 21 per cent from 1969. This sharp
increase resulted from extremely strong demand abroad for most
agricultural products, together with a reduction in foreign supplies
of some competing commodities. About a third of the rise was accounted
for by soybean exports, while the remainder was attributable to exports
of wheat, cotton, corn and grain sorghum. Some of the increase in the
value of soybean and corn exports reflected higher export prices in
1970. However, high U.S. prices held down exports of unmanufactured
tobacco, while shipments of rice were depressed because of greater
production abroad. For 1971, the outlook is for another good year for
agricultural exports, although the high 1970 levels will probably not
be exceeded.

IV -7
Exports of nonagricultural commodities dropped in the fourth
quarter of 1970, more than offsetting the rise in agricultural exports.
The declines were concentrated in steel, automotive, and machinery
exports. Steel exports, which had been booming from mid-1969 to mid-
1970, fell in the third quarter and declined further in the fourth
quarter. The sizable reduction in automotive exports -- especially to
Canada -- was associated largely with the GM strike. Machinery exports
dropped somewhat from the high third-quarter rates, with the greater
part of the decline in the months of November and December. This
November-December decline occurred in machinery exports to most major
areas, but especially to Latin America and Western Europe. In contrast,
exports of civilian aircraft, coal, and chemicals rose in the fourth
quarter.
Nonagricultural exports for the entire year 1970 increased by
about 14 per cent from the 1969 level despite the overall decline in
the value of such exports in the third and fourth quarters. A key
factor in the increase from 1969 to mid-1970 was the vigorous expansion
of industrial activity in major foreign markets into the second quarter
of last year. Exports of machinery, civilian aircraft, and industrial
supplies -- especially chemicals, steel and coal -- accounted for the
greater part of this upsurge in the value of non-farm exports. Automotive
exports were the only major comodity group showing a decline in 1970,

IV -8
mainly because of the GM strike.
Imports in the fourth quarter were at a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of $41.1 billion (balance-of-payments basis), 3 per cent
above the third-quarter level. For 1970 as a whole, imports were $39.9
billion, 11-1/2 per cent above 1969.
The rise in imports between the third and fourth quarters
can be attributed almost entirely to large increases in petroleum
imports, resulting from the U.S. fuel shortage, and in steel imports.
Imports of coffee, textiles, automobiles from Europe and Japan, and
non-durable consumer goods also registered gains. Imports of machinery
and automobiles from Canada were the only major categories that were
lower in the fourth quarter than the third.
For the year 1970, significant increases occurred in all major
categories of imports. Among foods, imports of coffee advanced because
of higher prices while domestic supply shortages resulted in higher sugar
quotas. Imports of industrial supplies, such as chemicals and metal
products, showed great gains in 1970. Steel imports, in particular,
increased as foreign producers with enhanced supply capabilities
attempted to meet their current U.S. quota levels in the anticipation
of possible renegotiation of these quotas. In 1971, imports of steel
should rise even further because of hedge buying in anticipation of a
mid-year steel strike. Threats of quotas may also have spurred the big
increase in textile fabric imports during the final months of 1970.

IV -9
Imports of fuel oil increased during 1970 to satisfy expanding U.S.
demand; however, deliveries of crude oil to the U.S. declined in 1970,
reflecting tanker shortages and production cutbacks in Libya.
Imports of machinery, both non-electric and electric, increased
significantly in 1970. Automotive imports, particularly from Japan and
Europe, also showed great gains. Sales of foreign-types cars in 1970
were 1.2 million units, about 130 thousand more than in 1969.
The strong increase in imports in 1970, despite the slowing
of the economy,was largely the result of higher import prices. There was
only a 3 per cent increase in the quantity of total imports while import
unit values rose by 8 per cent. This large advance in unit values
contrasts sharply with the 3 per cent rise in 1969 and year-to-year
increases of about 1 per cent in 1967 and 1968. Note, however, that a
rise in unit values may reflect compositional changes as well as actual
increases in import prices.

IV -10
Euro-dollar market
Interest rates in the Euro-dollar market fell substantially
in the first three weeks of January but firmed -- particularly in the
shorter maturities -- in the last few days of the month and the first
few days of February.
Call Euro-dollar deposits, which averaged about 6 per cent in
late December and early January declined to average about 4.6 per cent
in the latter half of January but then firmed to over 5-1/2 per cent in
the first few days of February. Three-month deposits fell to about 5.6
per cent late in January, down from nearly 7 per cent in late December.
The three-month rate has since firmed to around 5.8 per cent -- a small
increase in comparison with the recent advance in the call deposit rate.
As shown in the table below, the excess of the call Euro-dollar
rate over the Federal funds rate fell markedly during January -- reaching
about 3/8 per cent near the end of the month; but this differential has
since widened with the increase in the call Euro-dollar rate. The excess
of the one- and three- month Euro-dollar rate over the cost of CD's of
comparable maturity changed little on balance during January because re-
ductions in Euro-dollar rates were roughly matched by declines in CD
rates. Differentials in these maturities have increased to about 1-1/2
per cent in the first few days of February.

Liabilities of U.S. banks to their foreign branches increased by
an estimated $1.1 billion from December 31 to January 20, largely reflect-
ing the unwinding of foreign branch financing of U.S. corporate year-end
capital repatriations, rather than a flow of funds from foreign countries
to the United States through the Euro-dollar market. From January 20 to 27
liabilities to foreign branches declined by nearly $1.3 billion; $1 billion
of this decline reflected foreign branch acquisition of special Export-
Import Bank securities on January 25. Thus, for the week ended January 27
liabilities to foreign branches plus foreign branch holdings of special
Ex-Im securities declined, net, by about $300 million, to total about

IV -12
$7.7 billion. The reduction in liabilities to branches associated with
the Export-Import Bank security issue reflected the banks' decision to
finance the purchase of these securities out of the U.S. money market,
rather than with higher cost Euro-dollar funds. Data from January 27 to
Monday, February 1 show a further net decline in liabilities to foreign
branches of nearly $1/2 billion.
In the Euro-dollar reserve requirement computation period ended
January 20, 1971 the banks are estimated to have maintained daily average
borrowings about $3/4 billion below the average of the preceding period,
which in turn was about $1/2 billion below the average for the computa-
tion period ended November 25. There was a very sizeable decline in
borrowings around year-end and a subsequent rise; but total liabilities
to branches as of January 20 (about $8.0 billion) were little changed
from the total outstanding on December 23.
Daily data indicate that the banks' daily average borrowings
for January 21-February 1 are about $1.0 billion below their average in
the computation period ended January 20. Holdings of the Ex-Im securities,
acquired by the branches on January 25, will add back about $860 million
(on a daily average basis) to the reserve-free bases of the banks.
Recent advances in Euro-dollar rates may have been associated
with a moderate firming of some U.S. money market rates near month-end
as well as usual end-of-month tightening of conditions in the Euro-dollar
market. Exchange rates for most of the major European currencies,

IV -13
however, have eased in recent days as Euro-dollar rates have firmed,
implying that the advances in Euro-dollar rates have not been a conse-
quence of funds being attracted to European national money markets.
One major exception to this pattern was the sterling market where the
exchange rate has advanced since the last few days of January, reflect-
ing a substantial tightening of short-term money markets in Britain.
Foreign Exchange Markets
The sharp decline in Euro-dollar interest rates until near
the end of January -- see the preceding section -- led to large interest
arbitrage flows out of Euro-dollars and into assets denominated in
sterling and continental European currencies. Spot exchange rates for
most major foreign currencies advanced strongly, reaching or nearly
reaching their upper limits. Forward discounts for these currencies
widened very sharply, tending to equilibrate covered interest yields
in the Euro-dollar market and national money markets. The Bank of
England and major European central banks intervened heavily in the
exchange markets, purchasing nearly $1-1/2 billion in spot and swap
transactions (excluding the reversal of year-end swaps between the
Swiss National Bank and Swiss commercial banks). At the end of
January and in the first few days of February, as previously cited,
Euro-dollar rates rose markedly, and foreign currencies eased.
The Bank of England was the largest reserve gainer in
January, purchasing $535 million. Some $235 million of this spot

IV -14
intake was swapped out to the market, shifting that part of Britain's
reserve gains into February. Spot sterling rose by more than two full
cents during January, and closely approached the ceiling rate of $2.42.
Two main factors behind this strength were interest-arbitrage flows
and heavy commercial demand reflecting and anticipating the usual tax
period tightness in London financial markets and the accompanying
seasonal strength of sterling. Around month-end an acute squeeze on
sterling cash balances developed, sending interbank loan rates on over-
night sterling to as high as 8-1/2 per cent (compared with Euro-dollar
rates of 5-1/2 -6 per cent). The absence of a discount rate reduct-
ion by the Bank of England (widely expected in early January), coupled
with a modification of exchange controls to curtail foreign borrowing
by British corporations, convinced the market that Britain was deter
mined to continue its restrictive monetary policy, and led to some
cutting out of short positions in sterling.
Among continental central banks, the Bank of France added
$325 million to its reserves through market intervention in January,
the German Federal Bank $285 million, the Bank of Italy $240 million,
and the National Bank of Belgium $210 million. The currencies of each
of those countries strengthened, apparently, mainly on the basis of
interest arbitrage demand. The German mark, however, remained well
below its upper limit despite the decline in Euro-dollar rates until
near the end of January. Following the Bundesbank Credit Council's

IV -15
decision, on January 20, not to lower the discount rate, the exchange
rate jumped up sharply and stayed at or very close to the ceiling
through month-end.
The Dutch guilder firmed sharply early in the month as the
Netherlands Bank took delivery of guilders swapped against dollars back
in October. When the exchange rate reached the ceiling, the central
bank again offered guilders to the market on a swap basis, and in effect,
rolled over about two-thirds of its maturing swaps. Following this
operation, the domestic money market eased, the spot exchange rate
slipped below its ceiling and a small premium developed on forward
guilders.
The Swiss franc firmed throughout January as Swiss banks
delivered almost a billion dollars equivalent of Swiss francs to the
central bank, unwinding the over-year-end swaps done during December.
In official transactions, the Treasury during January sold
$100 million equivalent of SDRs and $25 million in gold to the
Netherlands Bank. In addition, it drew $125 million equivalent of
Dutch guilders from the IMF. These transactions enabled the System
to reduce its swap indebteness to the Netherlands Bank by $225 million,
to an outstanding total of $75 million. (The Netherlands Bank's
uncovered dollar position was reduced by $25 million.)

IV -16
The Treasury also drew $125 million equivalent of Belgian
francs on the IMF, enabling the System to repay that amount of its
swap drawings on the National Bank of Belgium. In January and early
February, however, the System made further drawings, totaling $220
million, on the Belgians, and System indebtedness on that line cur-
rently amounts to $305 million.

IV -17
Reserves and payments balances of major industrial countries.
Official reserve gains of major industrial countries other than the
United States remained very large in the third quarter of 1970, and
increased still further in the fourth quarter. For the Group of Ten
countries excluding the United States, and for Switzerland, official
net foreign assets rose $3.3 billion in the third quarter -- moderately
less than in the second -- and $6.0 billion in the fourth (of which
about $2.0 billion reflected year-end repatriations by German and Swiss
banks). For all of 1970, these countries' official net foreign assets
increased by $15.2 billion, excluding initial allocations of SDR's which
provided them with an additional $1.3 billion of reserves. The same
group of countries lost $4.1 billion of reserves in 1968 and $2.3 billion
in 1969.
In January 1971, known exchange market intervention gains by
foreign central banks in the G-10 group (not including Switzerland)
totalled around $1.3 billion. The unwinding of Swiss banks' swaps with
the Swiss National Bank reduced Swiss reserves by $1.1 billion.
The massive reserve increase of the other G-10 countries in
the second half of 1970 reflected the group's collective balance-of-
payments surplus as measured by changes in official and commercial bank
net foreign assets combined, if allowance is made for year-end window-
dressing in Germany. In July-November there was little net change in
the net foreign position of commercial banks in the group as a whole.

IV -18
In December, German commercial banks repatriated about $900 million, and
Bundesbank reserves were thereby increased.
Underlying imbalances in payments for international trade and
long-term capital movements persisted in 1970. But the extraordinarily
large net reserve gains of the other industrial countries last year --
aggregating about $16-1/2 billion if their SDR allocations are counted
in and Switzerland is included -- also reflected very large repayments
by U.S. banks to the Euro-dollar market in addition to unusually
large placements of reserves in the Euro-dollar market by central banks
of this group of countries and others, and by the BIS. The funds put

into the Euro-dollar market in these two ways helped finance very large
private capital inflows into Germany and other countries that contributed
heavily to their reserve gains. The $16-1/2 billion net reserve gain of
the leading industrial countries outside the United States, together with
the gain of about $3-1/2 billion in the net reserves (including SDR alloca-
tions) of all other countries (according to early tentative estimates),
had their counterpart in the combination of an addition to world reserve
holdings of gold and SDR's of more than $3-1/2 billion, a U.S. net reserve

foreign reserve holders totalling nearly $10 billion, and an unidentified
discrepancy of more than $6 billion. Indications from various sources
suggest that at least half of this discrepancy is to be explained by Euro-
dollar placements by central banks and the BIS.
Every one of the G-10 countries other than the United States
appears to have run a balance-of-payments surplus in the second half of
1970, with the possible exception of the United Kingdom. Germany, Italy,
and Japan had notably stronger payments balances in the second half of
the year than in the first, wholly or partly because of shifts in capital
flows. Germany's second-half surplus was the largest of any country,
notwithstanding a deficit in December, when German business enterprises
ceased being net borrowers of large amounts of short-term funds abroad
and made net repayments instead. A surplus on current and long-term
capital accounts in the latter months of the year indicated underlying
strength in Germany's external position.
Italy's balance of payments had already shifted from deficit to
surplus in the first half of 1970. The increase in the surplus in the
second half in large part reflected a net capital inflow that was heavily
concentrated in the month of December. In Japan, the effect on the overall
balance of a lower level of net long-term capital outflow was supplemented
by a second-half seasonal improvement in the trade balance and by heavy
borrowing in the United States in December.
French official reserve gains slowed down, particularly in the
fourth quarter. The trade deficit narrowed in the fourth quarter, to about

IV -21
the second-quarter level, but there was evidently some slackening of
nonbank capital inflow. Britain's overall balance shifted into deficit
in the third quarter as a result of changes in short-term capital flows
but improved in the fourth quarter, Canada's external position has
remained very strong. The Canadian dollar exchange rate has risen
further, particularly in December and January, and is currently over
99 U.S. cents compared with the 92.5 cent parity prior to last June.
Germany's balance of payments surplus in the second half was
about $3.0 billion. The seasonally-adjusted trade surplus increased
further in the third quarter and in October, before falling rather sharply
in November. In July-November the trade surplus, imports c.i.f., was at
a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $4.9 billion, higher than in any
preceding quarter except the fourth quarter of 1968 when special factors
were involved. Germany's deficit on services and current transfers continued,
in the third quarter, to be much larger than the year before, principally
because of the effect of the 1969 revaluation on net tourist expenditures
and because of larger outward remittances by foreign workers in Germany.
In October and November, the year-to-year deterioration on current invisibles
was slowed. A services and current transfers deficit of close to $3.5
billion was registered in 1970, compared with $2.4 billion in 1969.
The net outflow of long-term capital from Germany, which diminished
rapidly over the course of the first seven months of 1970, gave way to a
net inflow in the following four months which totalled $330 million, or
$1.4 billion at an annual rate. Short-term net foreign borrowing by German

IV -22
companies swelled Germany's surplus by increasingly large amounts until
December, despite a one-half point reduction in the Bundesbank's discount
rate in July. The imposition of marginal reserve requirements on banks'
liabilities to domestic and foreign residents effective September 1
(modified and made more severe in November) was an added reason -- along
with the high level of business activity and easing credit conditions in
the Euro-dollar market -- for German enterprises to go abroad for funds.
Their net short-term borrowing abroad rose from $2.3 billion in January-
June to $3.3 billion in July-November, but gave way to a reported $500
million of net repayments in December, after the one-point, two-stage
reduction of the discount rate in mid-November and early December. Germany's
overall balance of payments was in deficit in December by around $900 million.
German banks drew down their net foreign assets in most months of the second
half, the particularly large reduction in December reflecting window-dressing
and other year-end pressures on bank liquidity.
Italy's balance of payments reached a turning point last March,
and has been in surplus almost all of the time since. The 10 months March-
December yielded a surplus of $1,165 million, of which $985 million was in
July-December and $350 million in December alone according to preliminary
data for that month. In January, the Bank of Italy had additional large
intervention gains totalling $240 million.
There was little change in Italy's seasonally adjusted trade
deficit in the second half of the year. The labor unrest which has

IV -23
continued to plague Italian industry hurt the trade balance by hampering
production of exports and import substitutes. For the first 11 months
the current account (payments basis) registered a $150 million deficit,
in marked contrast to the large current account surpluses of most years
of the 1960's, e.g., $2.0 billion (payments basis) in 1968. Both a
widened trade deficit and a smaller surplus on current invisibles
accounted for this shift. Italian officials generally welcome the elimina-
tion of a heavy current surplus as an improvement in resource allocation.
There has been a net inflow of non-bank capital since March,
when the earlier outflow was abruptly reversed. This net inflow totalled
$570 million through November, and its intensification caused a surprisingly
large overall balance of payments surplus in December of around $350 million.
Since March there has been a reduced net outflow of Italian capital compared
with 1969 and January-February 1970. In particular, the outflow of Italian
banknotes (measures by the return flow from banks abroad) dropped to an
average of $60 million per month in March-November, from $185 million per
month in the preceding 14 months. Administrative measures to discourage
the export of banknotes, taken in February, and higher returns on certain
types of domestic financial assets -- particularly bonds and bank deposits --
relative to comparable foreign assets contributed to this result.
Very extensive borrowing by Italian companies (almost exclusively
state enterprises), through issues of Euro-bonds and in the form of medium-

IV -24
term Euro-dollar bank loans, added $1,520 million to capital account
receipts in 1970, the better part ($930 million) coming before the end
of June. Less than one-fourth of these borrowings -- $340 million --
were bond issues.
The French balance of payments surplus of $313 million in the
third quarter was much reduced from earlier quarters in 1970, and probably
shrank further in the fourth quarter. Official reserves rose $282 million
in the fourth quarter and by perhaps as much as $320 million in January.
But commercial banks' net foreign assets contracted $75 million in October
(latest figure available). Commodity trade with nonfranc area countries
showed successively larger deficits in the second and third quarter, but
a smaller deficit in the final quarter of nearly the same size as in the
second. All of the French surplus in 1970 was caused by a net inflow of
non-bank capital, much of which was inspired by a return of confidence
in the franc after its August 1969 devaluation.
Shifting capital flows again played the main role in changes
in the British balance of payments after mid-1970. The second quarter
of last year had already seen the evaporation of most of the very large
first-quarter surplus, in which short-term capital flows based on renewed
confidence were the main ingredient. The overall balance on current
account and nonbank capital flows fell into deficit in the third quarter
because of a net capital outflow, partly because of a brief September

IV -25
crisis of confidence in sterling. In the fourth quarter, October-
November saw a payments surplus of $165 million and December a gain in
official net foreign assets of $125 million, figures suggestive of
renewed capital inflow. In October-November, banks in the United
Kingdom reduced their net foreign assets nearly $600 million,
most of which constituted shifts from foreign currency to sterling.
Comparing the two halves of 1970, Britain's trade balance
(seasonally adjusted) did not deteriorate during the year. A
balance in the first half was followed by a nominal $30 million
surplus in the second. Because of the July dock strike, monthly
figures can be quite misleading. A continuing surplus on current
invisibles of $500-600 million in the second half kept the overall
current account in substantial surplus.
There was a rush of short-term capital into sterling in
January 1971 (and heavy Bank of England intervention gains) which,
in conjunction with other capital inflows, was unwelcome to the
government because it weakened the effectiveness of domestic
monetary restraint. Effective January 12 British nonbank residents
are prohibited from borrowing foreign currency for use in the
United Kingdom unless the maturity of the loan is at least five
years. Such borrowing is thought to have been about $500 million
in 1970 but at a much higher rate recently.

IV -26
Belgium's balance of payments continued in surplus in the
second half of 1970 -- about $120 million, assuming that the December
decline in official reserves accurately measured a deficit in that
month. But this was smaller than the $210 million surplus of the
first half. Belgium's trade balance (as measured by shipments
through customs) was not as favorable after mid-1970 as in the preceding
nine months, but this was a reversion toward a more normal situation
following a period of unusual strength. Recorded movements of nonbank
capital (i.e., excluding trade credits) resulted in a nominal net
outflow in the first eight months of last year, but favorable shifts
in leads and lags seem to have persisted. In the period July-
November reductions in commercial bank net foreign assets added
considerably to the rise in official reserves. The National Bank
also had intervention gains of $210 million in January.
The Netherlands ran a surplus of about $250 million in
the second half, apparently despite a small deficit in the fourth
quarter. Speculative flows into guilders were heavy in the summer
and early autumn, their subsequent disappearance perhaps reflecting
a reduced likelihood of a guilder revaluation. Contrary to the
projections of the Dutch Central Planning Bureau, the balance on
current account deteriorated markedly because of a rising trade
deficit. For the year 1970 the current account -- with invisibles
recording surprisingly high net receipts -- probably showed a deficit
of about $275 million. The net inflow of nonbank capital last year
was about $700 million, an enormous sum for the Dutch economy.

IV -27
In Canada, the current account of the balance of payments
remained strong in the second half of last year -- although it
probably fell below the seasonally adjusted annual rate of $6 billion
(in U.S. dollars) registered in the third quarter. An unprecedented
trade surplus of $2.8 billion in 1970 was the major factor behind
last year's large current account surplus. Exports in the third and
fourth quarter of 1970 were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
more than $16 billion, about 17 per cent greater than a year earlier.
Among the main reasons for the surge in exports in 1970 were increased
shipments of raw materials following strike distortions in 1969,
strong wheat exports -- mainly to China and the Soviet Union --
and import demand in countries outside North America.
Canadian imports declined rather sharply in the fourth
quarter, to 6 per cent under the second quarter level (in terms of
U.S. dollar values), and -- at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
$12.6 billion -- were the lowest for any quarter since the final
three months of 1968. Automobile strikes reduced imports of autos
and parts, but weakened import demand in general reflected the
continuing softness of domestic demand. Canadian industrial production
continued to fall in the second half of last year.
There was some revival of long-term capital inflow into
Canada after its virtual disappearance in the second quarter, but
this did not bring the rate of inflow to the high levels of 1968-69
and early 1970. Offerings in the United States were about $300 million

IV -28
in the last nine months of 1970 compared with $1.9 billion in 1968,
$1.2 billion in 1969, and $360 million in January-March 1970. This
low rate is close to the present rate of retirement of Canadian bonds
held in the United States. Short-term capital outflows also resumed
in the second half, restoring the pattern that had persisted over the
past several years with the exception of the second quarter of 1970
when there was a major net inflow.
The Canadian dollar has shown no sign of weakening in recent
months. After appreciating from an average of over 96 U.S. cents in
June to 98-1/2 cents in October (New York noon buying rate), the exchange
rate oscillated around 98 cents before strengthening further in late
December. In the closing days of January the rate was above 99 cents.
To moderate movements in the rate -- usually to prevent more appreciation
of the rate than it desired -- the Bank of Canada bought $157 million
through exchange market intervention in July-August, sold $69 million
in September, and bought $33 million in October-December. The remaining
$269 million rise in Canadian official net foreign assets in the second
half of 1970 appears to have resulted from maturing forward contracts,
of which the authorities held $360 million on June 1 according to
Finance Minister Benson.
The Japanese balance of payments surplus of $1.37 billion in
the second half of 1970 was identical with that of the year-earlier
period, and contrasted with the equilibrium of the first half of 1970.
The trade surplus increased $1.13 billion from the first half to the

IV -29
second for seasonal reasons; on a seasonally-adjusted basis the trade
surplus was at an annual rate of approximately $4 billion in both
halves. Imports rose at an annual rate of 19 per cent from the first
half to the second, and exports by 15 per cent. The current account
surplus for 1970 was $2.03 billion, a deficit on current invisibles
offsetting about one-half of the trade surplus.
Japan exported $200 million of non-bank capital (including
errors and omissions) in the second half, down from about $450 million
in the first half but far above the $70 million of a year earlier. Net
exports of long-term capital in 1970 were far in excess of 1969, their
rise being partly offset by a higher net inflow of short-term funds.
Because of concern over the rapid buildup of its reserves,
during the summer and early autumn the Bank of Japan provided about
$600 million of special credits to commercial banks to facilitate
a shift from dollar to yen financing of imports, operations that
were reflected in a very large rise in the banks' net foreign assets
in the third quarter and a drop in official reserves. Earlier Bank
of Japan moves to reduce reserves in the second quarter were a $200
million loan to the World Bank and purchase of $83 million of U.S.
Eximbank participation certificates. Adjusting for these investments,
Japan's 1970 balance of payments surplus would be $1,663 million instead
of the $1,380 million measured by the monetary movements.

APPENDIX A: SUBSIDIZED HOUSING STARTS IN 1970*
Subsidized housing starts rose sharply in 1970, based on
consolidated data from HUD and the Farmers Home Administration on the
major subsidy programs for low- and moderate-income families in
operation during the year. Altogether, such starts, which include
publicly owned dwellings, totaled a remarkable 444,000 units, according
to preliminary estimates, and amounted to 30 per cent of all public and
private starts. In a year when total starts actually dipped slightly
on a year-to-year basis, the subsidized subtotal more than doubled both
in number and relative importance, as shown in the table. Moreover, if
the preliminary reports are correct, it exceeded the 400,000 annual rate
set for such housing as part of the ten-year housing production goal
established in the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968.

While all subsidized subgroups showed a gain, by far the largest
increases were registered by the FHA-insured programs for home-ownership
and rent subsidies initiated late in 1968. Such programs, which were
only beginning to gain momentum in 1969, are designed to hold monthly
cost for eligible home-owners to a level of no more than 20 per cent
of income with appropriate reductions in effective interest costs to as
low as 1 per cent. For qualified renters, comparable cost maxima in
relation to income are fixed at or below 25 per cent. Such terms were
obviously very attractive to qualified borrowers last year. Moreover,
with market interest rates to non-subsidized borrowers extremely high
and demand for the more expensive types of houses eroding, builders
turned aggressively toward the subsidized market. While adequate funding
by Congress was also important in this development, it may be noted that
the Government subsidies apply only to the interest cost and that the
principal amounts of mortgages involved must come from the private sector,
Consequently, the relative abundance of FNMA commitments for these as
well as other Government-underwritten mortgages was also a vital factor
in the 1970 advance, especially in the early part of the year.
An interesting facet of 1970 developments was the exceptional
rise shown for the fourth quarter, owing mainly to a pronounced upsurge
in December. This was related in part to the downward adjustment in
ceiling interest rates initiated as the month began, as well as to
other special factors, including apparently builders' desires to assure
themselves of adequate coverage under the FHA programs over the period
ahead and the interest of all the Government agencies involved in
assuring that at least the full 400,000 starts figure for all programs
be achieved in 1970. Altogether, the December increase in subsidized
units contributed dramatically to the rise in the seasonally adjusted
annual rate of total starts to nearly 2 million units in December, a
twenty-year high as reported by the Gensus Bureau.
Some slowing in the subsidized starts pace is likely during
the early months of this year, owing to the exceptional December surge
and the borrowing from the future which that apparently involved.
However, assuming full funding for all programs, indicated Government
expectations are that the total of such starts for the year as a whole
will continue to grow, possibly to or over 500,000 units. 1/
1/ While a recent suspension of the FHA-insured subsidized home-owner
program for existing units pending elimination of irregularities will
impede real estate transactions in general, it will not necessarily have
a direct effect on new housing activity, which, under present legislation,
benefits from a 70 per cent allocation of total funds for this particular
program in any case. Moreover, some additional support may come from

Meanwhile builders themselves have already indicated plans for
moving even more strongly into this market, according to a recent survey
by the National Association of Home Builders. To meet the more rigorous
price requirements involved and to counter increased buyer resistance to
higher residential costs, the builders surveyed generally also plan to
cut home-sizes further and reduce other amenities. Reflecting this
shift, builders expect their median prices for new homes of all types
to decline appreciably further this year, possibly to $22,500 compared
with $23,500 last year.

final implementation of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board's new "Housing
Opportunity Allocation Program" (HOAP), which derives from legislation
incorporated in'the Emergency Home Finance Act of last year and which was
recently funded. Under present plans, which are still in a formative
stage, about 70,000 additional borrowers on new or existing houses might
be accommodated, with income limits ranging up to $12,000 or 150 per cent
above those set for HUD's interest- and rent-subsidy programs.

APPENDIX B: COMPOSITION OF CORPORATE BOND OFFERINGS*
Dramatic movements in yields on newly issued corporate bonds
in 1970, especially in the latter half of the year, were reflected in
changes in the industrial, quality, and maturity composition of total
gross offerings. For the year as a whole, the volume of public and
private bond offerings increased by almost $11 billion. Most of this
growth in bond financing was accounted for by two industrial sectors,
communications and manufacturing, which together accounted for almost
half of the total offerings in 1970, as compared with one-third of the
1969 total. The increased quality consciousness of investors in the
wake of the liquidity problems that became manifest around mid-1970
resulted in a preponderance of investment-grade bonds in the offerings
totals and a sharp decline in issues rated Baa or lower. The high level
of rates and the uncertainty about future trends which prevailed in the
late spring and early summer of 1970 also contributed to the rise in the
proportion of intermediate-term issues.
INDUS TRIAL COMPOSITION
The absolute volume of bond offerings increased in each of the
major industrial categories in 1970, but not all industries participated
equally in this financing growth. As a result of two extremely large
individual debt issues by AT&T, and an increased pace of bond offerings
by the subsidiary companies of the Bell System, the communications
industry's share of new bond issues surged in 1970. However, this
increase was concentrated in the second and fourth quarters, when the
parent telephone company was in the market, as shown in Chart 1.
The manufacturing sector's share of gross offerings rose from
about one-quarter of the 1969 total to almost 30 per cent in 1970, with
issues in the $100 million and over size class accounting for an
increasing proportion of the new industrial bond volume in the latter
half of the year. Indeed, almost 90 per cent of the dollar volume of
industrial bonds offered during the year represented borrowing by firms
included in the Fortune 500 list of the largest manufacturing companies
in the U.S. In the mid-1960's the 500 largest industrial corporations
accounted for about 70 per cent of industrial bond financing. In the
market environment of 1970, access to the bond market was limited to
large, well-known manufacturing corporations.
Public utilities maintained a record level of bond offerings
throughout 1970, as indicated in Chart 1, but they were somewhat less
important, relatively, in the bond market than in previous years. The

B -2
utilities, in an effort to maintain their debt-equity ratios and bond
ratings, doubled the volume of their gross equity financing between 1969
and 1970, thus shifting a portion of the industry's long-term financing
from the bond to the stock market.
For the year as a whole, the relative growth of the financial
and other categories was small, but in the fourth quarter of 1970, when
new issue yields declined sharply, there was a resurgence of financing by
financial, transportation, and retail firms, which had been effectively
barred from the market earlier by prohibitively high interest rates and
investor preference for high-grade securities. As a consequence, the share
of manufacturing in total bond offerings declined somewhat in late 1970.
QUALITY STRUCTURE
As noted earlier, there was a significant upgrading in the quality
structure of bond issues during 1970. Investment-grade bonds, those rated
A or higher, accounted for almost 90 per cent of total gross offerings in
1970, as compared to less than three-quarters in 1969. There was a

particularly sharp increase in the volume of A-rated issues, which reflects
the dominance of large industrial firms, whose bonds were readily accepted
by investors even during periods of rapidly fluctuating rates. The really
significant change was the year-to-year decline, in both absolute and
relative terms, of bonds rated Ba or lower, shown in Chart 2, which gives
the proportion of lower quality bonds, by quarter in 1969 and 1970.
Borrowers in the lowest rated categories virtually dropped out of the
market in the latter half of 1970, as the spread between Aaa and Baa bonds
continued to widen.
MATURITY STRUCTURE
The sensitivity of borrowers to high interest rate levels and
shifts in investor expectations is also evident in the apparent substitu-
tion of intermediate-term debt for long-term debt in recent years. The
volume of bond offerings in the five-to-ten-year maturity range first
became significant in 1969, with 12 percent of the annual public bond
volume in such shorter-term instruments. But in the late spring of 1970,
as yields on long-term new issues rose rapidly and investors became
increasingly concerned about the long-run trend of interest rates, the
proportion of intermediate-term debt soared, and during the second half
of 1970 almost one-quarter of the new public bond issues had maturities
of 10 years or less. As rates fell in the first quarter of 1971,
however, fewer firms filed intermediate-term debt issues and, based on
the offerings now scheduled for this quarter, the staff estimates that
the under-10-year maturity offerings will account for between 15 and 20
per cent of total public bond volume in the first three months of 1971.
SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK
In the stringent market conditions that characterized the
spring and summer months of 1970, medium-sized, small, and lower-grade
borrowers found it too costly--and often impossible--to raise funds in
the capital markets. The bulk of the funds raised in the public bond
market went to high-grade borrowers-large manufacturers, communications
firms, and public utilities. Favorable net interest cost differentials
and a desire for flexibility in financing decisions also led a number
of firms to do intermediate-term financing in the bond market. However,
as yields dropped in the final months of 1970, the industrial composition
of the bond market began to shift back toward a more normal pattern,
In view of the increased availability of funds, the generally
easier market conditions now evident, and the potential increase in
equity financing, the staff expects the total volume of public bond

offerings to be slightly lower in the first quarter of 1971. There will
probably also be some decrease in the proportion of shorter-term issues.
There may be a modest increase in the proportion of issues by medium-grade
corporations, but this trend could be moderated by the improved ability
of corporations to obtain financing through bank term loans, private
placements, and new stock issues.

Projected surpluses in the trust funds, amounting to $7.0 and $11.5
billion in fiscal years 1971 and 1972, respectively, partially offset
expected deficits of $25.5 and $23.1 billion in the Federal funds
component of the unified Budget. A full-employment surplus (unified
budget basis) of $1.4 and $.1 billion is expected in fiscal years
1971 and 1972 respectively. The Board staff estimates are a $21.6
billion unified Budget deficit in fiscal 1972 and about a $4 billion
high employment deficit (unified budget basis).

Budget Estimate of Outlays. Federal outlays are estimated to
increase $16.4 billion in fiscal 1972, about $.2 billion more than the
increase in the current fiscal year. Net lending, included in total
outlays, would continue to decline in fiscal 1972. As shown in the table
below, the largest planned increases in fiscal 1972 are for general
revenue sharing, social insurance, public assistance and natural resource
development. General and special revenue sharing is estimated to add
$4.0 billion although it is not to be effective until October 1971. But
this lump sum addition substitutes to some extent for normal growth in
the existing grants program.
In the social insurance category, the major increase is for
the Administration's proposed 6 per cent increase in social security
benefits, effective retroactively to January 1, 1971, costing $3.0
billion annually. A predicted decline in unemployment insurance benefits
is expected to offset most of the normal growth in social insurance
benefits. The Administration again porposed adoption of welfare reform
(the family assistance program) and although the benefit payments would
not begin before fiscal 1973, start up costs of $.5 billion are included
in the public assistance category of the Budget for fiscal 1972. In the
natural resources category a $.6 billion increase is proposed for the
new Environmental Protection Agency (mainly water pollution control).
Most of the $1.1 billion indicated increase in outlays for health is for
medicare and medicaid, even though legislation proposed by the Administration
would save more than $.8 billion in these programs.
After declining for two years, outlays for national defense
are expected to increase by $1.1 billion in fiscal 1972. However,
the increase in defense includes general pay increases costing $1.5
billion more than this year in addition to $1.2 billion as a step
toward an all-volunteer army. The decline in outlays for commerce
and transportation reflects an assumed postal rate increase (a negative
expenditure) effective May 15, 1971 that would reduce net outlays by $1.6
billion in fiscal 1972.
Staff Estimate of Outlays. The Board staff's estimate of
outlays in fiscal 1972 is $5.8 billion higher than the Budget document
estimate. This higher estimate is mainly accounted for by out
assumption that passage of a social security bill calling for a 10
per cent increase in social security benefits (including an increase in
the minimum monthly check to $100) is likely. This compares to the
Budget assumption of a flat 6 per cent increase. Also, we project
higher outlays for unemployment compensation (consistent with the staff's
projection of the unemployment rate) and assume a second pay raise for
postal workers in the second half of the fiscal year that is not offset
by a further postal rate increase.

Budget Estimate of Receipts. The Budget projects total receipts
of $217.6 billion in fiscal 1972, a $23.4 billion increase in actual tax
receipts. Since the full employment budget receipts increase by $15
billion the economy is assumed to grow rapidly enough to begin
reducing the gap between actual and potential output. These estimates
include $2.8 billion in receipts arising from proposed legislation to
increase the social security tax base from $7,800 to $9,000, effective
retroactively to January 1, 1971, and a revenue loss of $2.7 billion
because of the recent revision in depreciation guidelines.
The economic assumptions for calendar 1971 underlying the
Budget receipts estimates are: (1) an $88 billion increase in GNP to
a level of $1,065 billion; (2) a $67 billion increase in personal

-4-
income to a level of $368 billion; and (3) an increase in corporate
profits before tax to $98 billion. 1/
Staff Estimate of Receipts. The Board staff is currently
projecting lower economic magnitudes for calendar 1971--$1,045 billion
for GNP, $856.5 billion for personal income, and $81.9 billion for
corporate profits before taxes. Because of these lower income assumptions,
the staff's estimate of unified budget receipts in fiscal 1972 is consi-
derably lower than receipts in the Budget document,--by $4.2 billion--
even though the staff assumes somewhat greater marginal tax rates. For
the current fiscal year the staff and the Budget estimates of receipts
are in agreement.
Federal Borrowing Estimates. The Budget document indicates
that net borrowing from the public will be $17.6 billion in the current
fiscal year and $ 0.6 billion in fiscal 1972. Staff estimates for
borrowing in fiscal year 1972 amount to $20.6 billion.
Total debt subject to statutory limitation is projected by
the Budget to increase $24.9 and $23.6 billion in fiscal years 1971
and 1972, respectively, necessitating an early increase in the legal
debt ceiling.
II. Federal Sector in the National Income Accounts
On a national income accounts basis, the Budget forecasts
deficits of $15.0 billion and $4.2 billion in the current fiscal year
and in fiscal year 1972, respectively. Federal receipts, NIA basis,
are projected to increase from $200.0 billion in fiscal 1971 to $225.9
billion in fiscal 1972. Due to our lower income assumptions, the
staff estimate of receipts is $1.3 billion lower in the current fiscal
year. 2/ The staff has not projected receipts on a NIA basis for fiscal 1972.
Staff projections of Federal expenditures through fiscal
1972 (NIA basis) are shown in the table below. In these projections, total
Federal purchases of goods and services are not expected to increase in
calendar 1971 above the level in the second half of 1970. Defense
expenditures through calendar 1971 are expected to continue the present
downward trend while non-defense moves rapidly upward. In the first
half of calendar 1972, the large increase in defense and non-defense
purchases reflects a Federal pay increase for civilian and military personal
and the initial cost of the proposed move toward the all-volunteer army.
1/ Note: Apparently the corporate profits figure shown in the Budget
document should have been $93 billion because a $4.5 billion
downward adjustment for increased depreciation expense due to the
revision of the depreciation guidelines was overlooked, although the
adjustment was made in receipts.
2/ The lower staff estimate of NIA receipts, as compared to the same estimates
for unified budget receipts, results from the way corporate profit taxes
enter the two budget concepts.

-5-
Staff projections of Federal transfer payments call for a sharp
increase in the projected period, especially in the first half of
calendar 1971. The sharp rise in transfers to persons in the first half
of calendar 1971 is due largely to an increase expected in social security
benefits. Grants also are expected to grow sharply during the projected
period, consistent with the Administration's intentions to accelerate
programs that are currently lagging behind schedule and the effects of
the proposed revenue sharing program beginning in the fourth quarter
of 1971.
According to Staff estimates, the federal deficit (NIA basis)
will be about $ 9 billion in calendar 1971, about $6 billion more than
in the second half of 1970. To a large extent, the projected deficit
in the current calendar year reflects a shortfall in receipts arising
from the slowdown in economic activity. As shown in the table below,
Staff estimates of the high employment budget (NIA basis) suggest
little change in discretionary budget policy in calendar 1971 compared to
the second half of 1970. The projected $4.8 billion shift toward deficit
in the high employment budget balance in the first half of calendar 1972
suggests that programs proposed in the Budget may result in a more expansive
fiscal policy at that time.

1/ The staff estimate of expenditures for the projected period exceeds
the budget estimate because (1) the staff assumes a 10 per cent
increase in social security benefits in the first half of 1971 rather
than the 6 per cent increase included in the budget; (2) the staff esti-
mate includes a postal pay increase in the first half of 1972 that is

higher level of unemployment compensation expenditures because of
projected higher rate of unemployment than assumed in the budget.
