SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK
Nonfinancial
We are now projecting an increase of close to $30 billion in
current dollar GNP in the first quarter. This is larger than our pre-
vious projection, mainly because we have raised the levels of both in-
ventory investment and nonresidential construction. Real GNP is now
projected to rise at an annual rate of about 7 per cent, compared with
a fourth quarter decline now reported at 3.9 per cent.
The major expansive thrust this quarter is coming from the
recovery in auto production, but residential construction is also rising
sharply, and stockpiling of steel is making an appreciable contribution.
In other major demand sectors, the recent performance has generally been
lackluster.
The index of industrial production is tentatively estimated to
have changed little in February, with further increases in output of autos
and steel about offsetting declines in business and defense equipment.
Assuming only a small increase in March, the index would be up about
7 per cent (annual rate) from the fourth quarter of 1970 to the first
quarter of 1971, but the level would still be below the third quarter
of last year. Domestic auto sales continue to be disappointing, and
production schedules have been cut back somewhat for both February and
March.
New orders for manufacturers' durable goods rose moderately
further in January but, as in December, the increase was concentrated in

I -2
autos and steel. Orders for capital equipment remained at the fourth
quarter level, which was up moderately from the third quarter. On the
basis of the weekly data, retail sales in February apparently were up
somewhat. Apart from the automotive group the January-February level
of sales was little changed from the fourth quarter average.
The sharp rise in the wholesale price index in February was
attributable to severe weather which curtailed livestock shipments, and
was not typical of the underlying situation. Industrial prices showed
a quite small increase after seasonal adjustment, but revisions in the
preliminary estimates have been frequent in recent years and have
generally been up. The January advance in the consumer price index
was relatively moderate, following a sharp December increase.
In the second quarter, following the first quarter bulge,
we are projecting expansion in current dollar GNP to fall back to $19
billion and in real GNP to an annual rate of about 3.5 per cent. An
exceptionally large increase, however, is in prospect for disposable
income as a result of a sizable increase in social security benefits
assumed to be retroactive to the beginning of the year and to be paid
out late in the quarter. This development should help to sustain con-
sumer spending, which is projected to increase at an annual rate of
8 per cent in current dollars even though auto purchases provide little
further impetus. But the bulge in social security benefits will con-
tribute to an expected sharp, temporary increase in the saving rate.
In other key sectors, residential construction activity is likely to

I -3
rise further in the spring, but business fixed investment probably
will change little following the first quarter catchup in car, truck
and bus deliveries. The higher rate of inventory accumulation in
part reflects a stepped-up pace of steel buildup; on the other hand,
auto stocks are expected to level off.
In the second half of the year, we continue to assume a
steel strike which will make for an uneven pattern of inventory in-
vestment and GNP growth. Final sales are expected to strengthen,
mainly because of the resumption of increases in business fixed in-
vestment and Federal purchases. Real GNP for the two quarters com-
bined is projected to increase at an annual rate of 3.7 per cent.
The economy, on balance, is thus expected to expand at
less than our rising growth potential, suggesting some further in-
crease in the unemployment rate and a continued low rate of capacity
utilization in manufacturing. Recent wage patterns suggest a contin-
uation of strong cost pressures, but with larger productivity gains
than we have experienced over the past two yearsthe rise in unit labor
costs is expected to slow. Thus, with supplies remaining generally
ample, we also project a slowing of the rise in the GNP deflator, to
an annual rate of about 3.5 per cent in the fourth quarter.
Financial
In February, short-term rates continued to decline; bank
credit maintained its more rapid rate of expansion--with business
loan growth accelerating; and the money stock grew much faster than

I -4
expected. However, long-term yields--with the exception of those in
the mortgage market--reversed their downward trend. The rise in yields
was most pronounced in the corporate bond market.
The sharp increase in corporate bond yields apparently re-
flected a shift in interest rate expectations of both borrowers and
lenders, as the announcement of the Administration's GNP target con-
tributed to a growing belief that interest rates may be near their
cyclical lows. Consequently, investors became more hesitant and a
number of corporations accelerated planned security issues.
Outlook. The forthcoming heavy supply of new corporate and
tax-exempt securities issues will tend to limit long-term rate declines
in coming weeks, although, with market expectations unusually sensitive,
unfolding economic news could cause abrupt yield movements in either
direction. On balance over the second quarter, however, corporate
bond rates could decline from present levels, if, as expected, the
flow of internal funds to businesses increasesand corporate bond
offerings drop off, and if economic growth proves relatively modest.
Over the more immediate future, the exceptionally large
volume of business financing in capital markets is likely to be re-
flected in an acceleration of bank loan repayments. The staff thus
expects business loan growth to moderate in March from the rapid
February pace. If this moderation occurs, and if strong deposit
growth continues, further cuts in bank time deposit and possibly lend-
ing rates can be expected.

I-5
Bank purchases of tax-exempt securities may remain sizable
over the near term, but such acquisitions are not likely to return to
the record pace of late 1970 and early 1971. As a result, it may be
more difficult for the expected near-record volume of new tax-exempt
issues to be absorbed at yields much below the levels of recent weeks.
Inflows of consumer time and savings deposits at banks and
thrift institutions are expected to remain large, although below re-
cent rates, into the spring, given the relatively low short-term mar-
ket yields that have developed. With thrift institutions unable to
place all of their funds in mortgages, the staff expects mortgage
rates to decline further and deposit rates to be cut--perhaps during
the next reinvestment period at the end of March. The rate of decline
in mortgage rates may be slowed, however, by the coming seasonal pickup
in home buying, the large expected S&L repayments to the FHLB, and a
sharp increase in planned mortgage sales by FNMA.
Balance of Payments
U. S. imports rose sharply further in January. Despite a good
pick-up in exports of auto components following the ending of the GM
strike, the trade surplus virtually disappeared.
For December and January combined, the trade surplus was at
an annual rate of only $0.5 billion. Imports in these two months, at an
average rate of over $42 billion, were up 11 per cent in value from a
year earlier--while GNP was up about 5 per cent. This strength of

I -6
demand for imports exerts an appreciable drag on the U. S. economy,
offsetting some of the force of expansionary factors. Our projection
of first-quarter net exports of goods and services has been lowered
once more.
In the over-all balance of payments, the deficit on the
liquidity basis appears to have been extremely large in January and
February, and the official settlements deficit was even larger. A
substantial part of the deterioration is unexplained by the data on
trade and capital flows available so far. The implication is that
there may have been large corporate capital outflows (which are re-
ported with a lag) and perhaps also large unidentifiable outflows.
The continuing gap between interest rates here and abroad, which in
some cases (U.K. and Germany) has widened since December, has no
doubt stimulated these outflows. For the same reason, there have
been further sizable declines in the total liabilities to U.S. bank
branches of U. S. banks plus those of the Export-Import Bank.
German and British reserve gains have been very large.
These gains have been due in great part to short-term capital flows
(including those arising from changing leads and lags in commercial
payments) responding to the gap between interest rates in those
countries and rates in the Eurodollar market or in the United States.

THE ECONOMIC PICTURE IN DETAIL
Domestic Nonfinancial Scene
Gross national product. While there is still a good deal of
uncertainty with respect to the strength of consumer expenditures and
inventory accumulation, the first quarter rise in GNP now seems likely
to total about $29 billion, as compared to the $26-1/2 billion we pro-
jected last month. In real terms, the current projection implies an
annual rate increase in GNP in excess of 7 per cent; real GNP declined
by almost 4 per cent, annual rate, in the fourth quarter of 1970.

As expected, this rebound represents largely a post-strike
recovery in production and sales of motor vehicles. Although sales
of domestic cars, and consumer outlays generally, are falling somewhat
short of our expectations, we now anticipate a larger rise in business
fixed investment and a higher rate of inventory investment than pro-
jected last month.
Unit sales of domestic autos have been somewhat disappointing
so far this quarter, averaging under 8 million, annual rate, for January
and the first 20 days of February, and we have trimmed our projected rate
of unit sales for the quarter from 8.3 to 8.1 million. But this annual
rate of sales is still about 2-3/4 million above that of the s trike-
depressed fourth quarter. Moreover, sales of foreign autos have surged
upward and in January were well above the fourth quarter rate. With
prices of both foreign and domestic models rising, consumer outlays for
autos appear likely to be about $10 billion larger in the first
quarter than in the fourth.
Other categories of retail sales have been sluggish so far
this quarter; furniture and appliance sales apparently are running
below their fourth quarter level, and sales of nondurables as a whole
are only fractionally higher. Consequently, we have cut back our
estimate of consumer outlays by about $1 billion from the preceding
Greenbook, and we are now projecting an increase of $17.8 billion for
the quarter. Our estimate of net exports has also been revised down
somewhat, reflecting larger imports than expected in January--possibly
of autos--and the failure of exports to rise as much as projected.

II -3
In other major demand sectors, however, our present projections
either equal or exceed those of last month. Revised estimates for
December and new figures for January suggest that private nonresidential
construction outlays--instead of declining--may rise slightly in the
firstquarter. In addition, outlays for producers durable equipment now
appear to be somewhat larger than expected, and altogether we have
revised our projections of business fixed investment up by about $2
billion. Residential construction activity still appears likely to
show a gain of about $4-1/2 billion for the quarter, and we continue to
expect an accelerated rate of growth in State and local government outlays--
although we have no hard evidence of this as yet. Defense purchases
are apparently holding at the fourth quarter level, rather than dropping
slightly as we had anticipated earlier. On balance, therefore, it now
appears that final sales should increase about $30 billion this quarter,
about the same as projected last month.
We continue to expect a drop in inventory investment this
quarter, but by less than anticipated in the previous Greenbook.
Further inventory reductions are expected in industries producing capital
goods and defense products, and efforts to reduce high inventory sales
ratios in some other lines appear likely. But even given the reduced
auto production schedules for March, the disappointing rate of sales
of domestic autos should result in greater additions to stocks, and
recent orders figures suggest that steel stockpiling this quarter may
be somewhat larger than we had anticipated. In total, we are estimating
inventory accumulation of about $23 billion, rather than the $.8 billion
projected last month.

II -4
Our projectionsfor the remainder of the year remain essentially
unchanged from the last Greenbook, assuming financial conditions con-
sistent with an increase in the money supply at about a 6 per cent
annual rate. GNP growth in the second quarter is projected to drop
back to $19 billion, as the current quarter's post-strike rebound in
motor vehicles production is unlikely to be repeated. If so, the increase
in GNP in real terms would recede to about a 3-1/2 per cent rate.
If our assumption of a steel strike of about 60 days beginning
August 1 materializes, expansion in GNP should be quite limited in the
third quarter, dropping back to about $14 billion. But then there
should be a rebound--much as inthe current period--with fourth quarter
GNP rising by perhaps $25 billion. These figures are essentially
unchanged from our last projection, and imply real GNP growth at
around a 3-1/2 per cent annual rate in the last half of the year.

Industrial production. On the basis of very limited informa-
tion, industrial production is tentatively estimated to have changed
little in February as increases in output of autos and steel appears to
have been about offset by further declines in other industries, mainly
business and defense equipment. The total index at about 165 per cent
in January and February would be 3 per cent below a year earlier and
1.5 per cent above the fourth quarter of 1970.
Auto assemblies in February were at an annual rate of about
9.0 million units (preliminary) compared with 8.3 million units in
January. Production schedules for March have been cut back from a 9.6
million unit rate estimated earlier and are now indicated to be at
about the February output level. (The February rise in autos and
trucks is equivalent to .3 of a point in the total industrial production
index.) Output of home radios and television sets in the first 3 weeks
of February was reduced appreciably further. Production of furniture
and of consumer staples, which has increased in the past several months,
probably rose again in February.
Production of industrial and commercial equipment, which has
declined steadily since March 1970, probably was down further in
February. The small rise in truck production will be more than offset
by heavy cutbacks in the aircraft industry, especially by Lockheed.
Output of farm equipment recovered from the strike-reduced low in
January.
Available weekly output data for a few materials indicate a
further rise in steel production as stockpiling continued in anticipation

II -9
of a possible strike. (A 4 per cent rise in the iron and steel index
is equivalent to a rise of about .4 of one point in the total index.)
Output of crude petroleum, however, was cut back and paperboard production
remained below year ago levels. A strike in the metal can industry,
which began February 15, may have chipped off about .1 of one point in
the total index.

Retail sales. Reports for the first three weeks of February
tentatively suggest that sales for the month may have been about half
a per cent higher than in January. As in January, sales of the auto-
motive group were largely responsible for the rise. Excluding the auto-
motive and the building materials, farm equipment, and hardware categories,
average January and February sales are no higher than in the fourth
quarter.

Consumer credit. Personal bankruptcies, which had declined
in 1968 and 1969 after increasing in most other postwar years, rose
sharply during 1970. For the full year, approximately 190,000 personal
bankruptcy cases were filed, up 12 per cent from 1969 and just barely
below the record high in 1967. While 1970 reversed the downturn of the
two previous years, the rise in filings was substantially below the
percentage increases of earlier recession years. During 1961, for
example, the number of personal bankruptcies rose 34 per cent, and the
increases in 1958 and 1954 were 26 and 33 per cent, respectively.
Seasonally adjusted quarterly figures indicate that personal
bankruptcies did not advance noticeably until the second quarter of
last year. By the fourth quarter, however, filings rose above the 1967
high quarter. In the second half of 1970, estimated filings were 14
per cent higher than in the second half of 1969.

Personal income. Personal income advanced by $8 billion to
an annual rate of $825 billion in January. Wages and salaries rose by
$6.6 billion, reflecting payroll increases of about $2 billion each in
trade, government, and services. The rise in trade mainly reflected a
large seasonally adjusted increase in employment in January, following
declines in November and December, while the rise in government payrolls
was primarily a result of the Federal pay raise. The advance in personal
income included large increases in dividends ($1.8 billion after a
decline of about the same amount in December) and transfer payments
($1 billion largely reflecting increased unemployment insurance payments).
On the other side of the ledger, there was an increase of $2.1 billion in
personal social insurance taxes.
Despite the large January increase, which partly reflected
normal growth and partly reflected the auto-strike recovery, personal
income advanced only 5.5 per cent (annual rate) over the past six
months and in real terms there was very little improvement. Aggregate
wages and salaries rose at about the same rate, with the entire rise
attributable to higher average hourly wages; payroll employment and
hours worked declined. Manufacturing payrolls in January were unchanged
from July 1970 and still somewhat smaller in January than a year earlier.
Private nonmanufacturing payrolls continued to expand, but at a slower
rate than last year.

Construction and real estate. Seasonally adjusted value of
new construction put in place continued to edge higher in February,
following an upward revision of 2 per cent for January. At $97.7 billion,
the February rate was 6 per cent above a year earlier.
Bolstered by a sharply higher rate of housing starts in recent
months, outlays for private residential construction have continued to
provide most of the basis for month-to-month increases in total private
outlays. However, private nonresidential outlays,which had been exhibiting
little strength, have been revised sharply upward and now show a sizable
increase for January. In current dollars, both nonresidential and total
public construction were about the same as in February 1970, but were
down substantially after adjustment for rising costs. A major factor
contributing to higher costs has been sharply rising construction wage
rates. In an effort to dampen further cost advances, President Nixon
suspended the provisions of the Davis-Bacon Act, which required contractors
on Federally-funded projects to pay "prevailing" wage rates, as determined
by the Department of Labor.

The sharp drop in the seasonally adjusted annual rate of
private housing starts in January essentially reflected a reversal
from the unusually high number of FHA-insured subsidized housing
starts in December. The staff does not believe that the January drop
signals a turnabout in residential construction. On the contrary,
with the inflow of savings to the intermediaries continuing strong,
with the volume of commitments rising, and with mortgagesinterest
rates falling sharply, seasonally adjusted starts are on average
expected to advance for some months to come.

Sales of homes are also expected to pick up more than
seasonally, sparked by the abundance of mortgage funds and the recent
lowering of the Government-underwritten home mortgage ceiling rate to
7 per cent. Prior to the ceiling rate change, a number of trade sources
had reported that some prospective home-buyers were reluctant to close
sales because they anticipated a further drop in the FHA and VA ceiling
rate.
Although starts and sales are expected to rise at least
through the end of summer, housing activity throughout 1971 is likely
to be concentrated in lower priced units. The latest data available
from merchant builders indicate that the trend toward the purchase of
lower cost units continued in December. The average price of all new
single-family homes sold in December (with all types of financing) was
4 per cent below a year earlier.
Plant and equipment spending plans. Private surveys recently
taken by the Rinfret-Boston and Lionel D. Edie companies report
dramatically different spending plans by business for new plant and
equipment in 1971: the Rinfret-Boston survey indicates a 9 per cent
gain while Edie shows only a 3 per cent increase. In both surveys all
of the planned increase is in nonmanufacturing (specifically in the
utilities, communications and commercial sectors) with manufacturers
planning a slight reduction from last year.

Cyclical indicators. The preliminary Census composite
leading indicator increased 1 per cent in January, after rising 1.8
per cent in December and 0.6 per cent in November. This index has
surpassed its pre-auto-strike high of July 1970 and is within half
a per cent of the September 1969 peak, in large part because of the
trend adjustment. Of the individual leading series, only three--
common stock prices, housing permits, and contracts and orders for
plant and equipment--were above their July 1970 levels, and none of
the indicators directly affected by the auto industry had recovered
to the July 1970 levels.
The coincident composite rose 1.4 per cent and the lagging
composite was unchanged in January.

declined in January, and the drop in housing permits was from a
record December level. In February, according to preliminary data,
common stock prices rose further and the industrial materials price
index rose for the first time in a year.
Manufacturers' orders and shipments. New orders for durable
goods rose 4 per cent in January, according to preliminary data.
Orders increased not only in the motor vehicle industry and at iron
and steel plants, but also in a number of other industries.

II -19
The increase in new orders for iron and steel between
September 1970 and January 1971 was substantially larger than in
the comparable pre-negotiations period of 1967-68, but not as large
as the $1.3 billion increase from September 1958 to February 1959.
These orders may increase further in February.

New orders in December were revised upward by over $0.5 billion
and are now reported to have increased 5.5 per cent from November. Capital
equipment orders accounted for the bulk of the upward revision. After a
strong November increase these orders fell back relatively little in
December and edged up in January. The January rate of capital equipment
orders was 8 per cent above the second quarter 1970 low. The announce-
ment in January of liberalized depreciation allowances had little
immediate effect on equipment ordering.
Durable goods shipments increased in January and unfilled orders
rose 1 per cent. Nondurable goods shipments and orders also increased.1971

Inventories. The book value of manufacturing inventories
declined at a $5.4 billion annual rate in January, following a $3.9
billion drop in December. The declines since November were mainly,
though not entirely, in durable goods, and occurred in the face of
some accumulation at steel mills in anticipation of stockpiling
by steel users.
In December, despite the decline in manufacturing stocks,
the total book value of business inventories rose at a $3.8 billion
annual rate, partly as a result of restocking by auto dealers
following the GM strike, and partly because of increases elsewhere
in retail and wholesale trade which may have been involuntary, at
least in part.

Manufacturing inventory shipments ratios were reduced
further in January, as inventories declined and shipments increased.
The durable goods inventory backlog ratio also declined further.
In December the cuts in manufacturing inventories and the
beginning of the strike-end recovery of auto sales effected some
reduction in the over-all business inventory-sales ratio. But in
wholesale trade and the nonautomotive durable retail sector--where
accumulation continued high--inventory-sales ratios rose and the
over-all trade ratio reached the highest point since November 1960.
In January, auto dealers continued to build their stocks of new cars,
but with the recovery of sales, their aggregate new car stock-sales
ratio fell to a level near the average for the late sixties.

Labor market. The labor market apparently continued slack, with
both insured unemployment and initial claims for benefits little
changed between mid-January and mid-February, after dropping in both
December and January. In part, recent declines in the rate of
insured unemployment have been due to exhaustion of benefits; over
120,000 persons exhausted their benefits in January and this probably
was a significant factor again in February.

* Staff estimate.
Over the last several months, extended unemployment benefits
programs have been introduced in a number of States, as provided in
the Employment Security Amendments of 1970. These amendments provide
up to 13 weeks of additional benefits when unemployment has risen
sharply in an individual State or is above a certain rate for the
nation as a whole. All States must provide extended benefits programs
in 1972; until then individual States have the option of joining the
program if they will share costs with the Federal government.
Currently, about 250,000 workers in 11 States and Puerto Rico
are drawing extended benefits. This compares with about 80,000
workers in five States and Puerto Rico drawing extended benefits in

II-23
mid-December and only about 30,000 in mid-October. Additional workers
are likely to be added in the months ahead as State legislatures
provide the necessary funding to enter the program, and as additional
workers exhaust benefits under regular coverage.

Hourly earnings. Wage increases have continued large in
recent months. Hourly earnings of production workers in the private
nonfarm economy increased 6.4 per cent over the year ending in
January 1971, slightly more than over the previous year. Hourly
earnings increases in manufacturing and transportation have accelerated
somewhat in the past year; both were affected by important collective
bargaining agreements in late 1970. The rates of increase of hourly
earnings remain high in services and construction but have moderated
somewhat in trade.
Upward pressure on wages is expected to continue strong
this year. More than 5.3 million workers covered by major union
contracts will be receiving deferred wage increases averaging 7.8
per cent. The largest number is in construction, where more than

II-24
1 million workers will receive deferred increases averaging 13.3 per
cent by mid-year. In addition, 2.5 million union workers will receive
automatic cost-of-living adjustments under existing collective bar-
gaining agreements. These assured wage increases, coupled with expected
large first-year wage raises for some 4.7 million workers negotiating
new contracts, suggest little moderation in the rate of increase of
wages in the unionized sectors of the economy during 1971.
Industrial relations. The United Steel Workers reached
agreement with the National Can Corporation on February 15, while
32,000 members went on strike at the other three major companies upon
expiration of their contracts. The agreement with National Can,
covering 4,000 workers, may set the pattern for settlements in the
rest of the can industry and possibly for upcoming negotiations in
aluminum, copper and steel.
The National Can Corporation agreement provided wage
increases totaling at least $1.10 over the life of the contract,
an estimated average of about 9 per cent per year--about in line with
the average rise in major collective bargaining settlements concluded
in 1970. The wage package included a first-year wage increase of
50 cents, or about 14 per cent; increases of 12-1/2 cents in both
the second and third years; and quarterly cost-of-living adjustments
beginning in the second year with a minimum 12-1/2 cent adjustment
guaranteed in both years. In addition, it is estimated that wage
rates will rise an average of 10 cents over the life of the contract

II-25
as a result of increases in wage differentials between job classi-
fications. The cost-of-living escalator formula in the can contract
is the same as in the auto worker contracts--a one-cent increase for
each 0.4 point rise in the Consumer Price Index, (1957-1959=100). If
the increase in consumer prices exceeds the guaranteed minimum adjust-
ment in the can contract--about a 3-1/2 per cent rise in consumer
prices in both 1972 and 1973, the increase in average wage costs for
National Can will exceed the 9 per cent per annum figure cited above.
Recent settlements in nonmanufacturing industries also
have been large. Three railroad unions recently agreed to 42-month
contracts providing average annual wage increases of 11 per cent
for about 230,000 workers. The United Transportation Union (195,000
members) continues to negotiate although the union was free to strike
March 1. In separate negotiations, the Railroad Signalmen (13,000
members) have set a March 5 strike deadline. At American Motors the
auto workers have not yet reached an agreement and have set a March 8
strike deadline.
Wholesale prices. Wholesale prices rose at an estimated
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 7.9 per cent in February (January 12th
to February 9th) primarily as a result of a sharp increase for farm and
food products. Prices of industrial commodities, on a preliminary
basis, rose at only a 1.6 per cent annual rate, one of the smallest
monthly increases since mid-1969.

The sharp increase in prices of farm products and foods in
February was attributable to livestock and meat and reflected severe
weather which curtailed shipments of livestock. Under more normal
weather conditions, the rise in farm product prices would have
been much less, although it is still uncertain whether livestock and
meat prices will recede this month or next to the January levels. In
January, hog prices were depressed on the pricing date by the largest
marketings in 5 years. In February, both beef cattle and hog prices,
but particularly the latter, were sharply higher. Hog prices have since
receded somewhat, as shown below, while prices of beef cattle thus far
have shown little change. Declines may lie ahead, however, as the
Department of Agriculture is forecasting "continued large supplies
(of livestock products) at least through mid-1971." The bulge in retail
prices of meat in February will be much less than in wholesale pricesp

II-27
because of temporary cost absorption of such fluctuations by processors
and retailers. According to the Department of Agriculture, preliminary
data for the first two weeks of February compared with January show a
2-1/2 per cent increase in the retail price of beef and a small
increase in pork prices. The farm-retail spread reportedly dropped
significantly to levels 12 to 15 per cent below those in January.

Prices for lumber and wood products increased much more than
seasonally in the January-February period as demand for softwood, plywood
and lumber rose. Although demand has softened since early February,
higher prices could lie ahead as residential construction increases

II -28
further. Mill capacity has been reduced 5-10 per cent in the last
year and one-half and higher prices are required to bring in
increased supplies. However, the tight conditions which resulted
in the 1968-69 surge in lumber prices are not now present.
Machinery and equipment prices continued to rise, but by
the smallest amount since last summer. Motor vehicles, furniture,
paperboard, and apparel also increased while fuels declined contra-
seasonally. Prices of nonferrous metals dropped further and lowered
the index for the metals and metal products group despite the increases
posted for steel mill products, iron and steel scrap, and some
fabricated products.
Consumer prices. The rise in the consumer price index slowed
in January to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.5 per cent, with
declines in mortgage interest rates and in prices of used cars, meat,
fruits and vegetables and apparel. However, new car prices rose
substantially and service costs continued to climb. Food prices were
unchanged overall as a drop of 4 per cent, annual rate, in the cost
of food at home was offset by a further rise in the cost of restaurant
meals. But food prices are expected to rise in February, reflecting
an appreciable advance in meat prices.

Clothing prices dropped more than seasonally in January with
unusually favorable clearance sales. This decline along with smaller
increases for gasoline and other nondurables reduced the rise for
nondurables less food to an annual rate of 1 per cent.
The major factor in slowing the rise in durable goods in
January was a sharp reversal in used car prices. New car prices,
however, rose contra-seasonally and both new and used car prices were
about 8 per cent above their January 1970 levels. Household durable
prices were unchanged from December and the rate of increase for
houses continued to slow.

Despite the drop in mortgage interest rates, serviee prices
continued to rise at about the 7 per cent rate maintained through the
last nine months of 1970. Excluding home finance, the rise in service
costs accelerated--reflecting substantial increases for auto insurance
premiums, education, and recreation,and continued advances for medical
services and utilities.
As a result of the reduction in rates on both VA-guaranteed
(from 8-1/2 to 8 per cent) and conventional mortgages,and also of the
slowing of the rise in home purchase prices, the home-ownership cost
component of the CPI showed no increase for the first time since6.6

II -31
March 1967. Such costs had risen at an average annual rate of about
10 per cent between June 1968 and December 1970. The further
declines in rates on VA and FHA-guaranteed mortgages (to 7 per cent)
will continue to affect the index through May as more commitments
are made at lower rates.
Agricultural outlook. A rise of about 7 per cent in disposable
income for the year 1971 and an increase of about 1 per cent in per
capita food consumption were predicted at the February Agricultural
Outlook Conference. Consumer prices were expected to increase further
but the rise in food prices was predicted to be limited by increased
supplies.
net income from farming
Farmers/was projected to be somewhat less than last year,
but income from nonfarm sources was expected to increase. Major
increases in costs of feed, labor, insurance, and real estate taxes
were predicted, while prices received were expected to average
substantially below 1970. Improvement in cost and availability of
credit combined with higher production costs, were expected to result
in continued expansion in farm debt. Some further increase in land
values was considered likely although the long-term rise had slowed
to 3 per cent in 1970.
Per capita consumption of red meats was projected at 191
pounds, 5 pounds more than last year. Pork was expected to account
for three-fourths of the increase and beef for the rest. Somewhat
larger supplies of milk,turkeys, and eggs and about the same supply of

II -32
broilers as last year were forecast. These favorable livestock supply
prospects hinge on the favorable resolution of two unusual uncertainties
in the outlook for 1971: (1) the net effects of the new farm programs
on crop production; and (2) potential damage caused by corn blight.
The Outlook evaluation of these uncertainties apparently is fairly
favorable. The January planting intentions report showed that
larger acreages are planned for feed grains. Even with as mugh blight
damage as last year, USDA estimates that with favorable weather, feed
grain output could be 10 per cent larger than in 1970. Output of
this size will support an ample scale of livestock production.

THE ECONOMIC PICTURE IN DETAIL
Domestic Financial Situation
Monetary aggregates. The money supply, narrowly defined
(M1), and other monetary aggregates rose sharply in February. Preliminary
estimates indicate that the daily average level of M1 rose from January
to February at an annual rate of about 15 per cent, with currency hold-
ings and private demand deposits both increasing sharply. This advance
counterbalanced the weak gains of other recent months--except in
December when growth was fairly sharp--and raised the rate of growth of
M1 since last September to 5.3 per cent, compared with 6.1 per cent in
the third quarter of last year. The rate of growth in M2 (M1 plus time
and savings deposits at commercial banks other than large CD's) also
increased in February, to an annual rate of 22 per cent, as an increase
in the rate of inflow of time deposits combined with the step up in M1
growth. The rate of growth in M2 since September has been 12.4 per cent
compared with 11.0 per cent in the third quarter of last year. The
February estimates are subject to revision when data for the last
several days of February become available; revised estimates will be
presented in the Supplement.
Exceptionally rapid growth in consumer-type time and savings
deposits at weekly reporting banks was a major factor in the high rate
of advance of the time deposit component of M2. In addition, at country
member banks time and savings deposit inflows appear to have continued
at the historically high rate of advance recorded in January. At both

III -2
groups of banks, savings deposit inflows were particularly strong,
reflecting the improved competitive position of savings deposits vis a
vis other types of available liquid investments. However, growth in
other time deposits included in M2 was quite modest as outflows of
foreign official funds nearly offset increases in State and local
deposits and other deposits.
Even though growth in large certificates of deposits diminished
substantially further, as banks became much less aggressive in issuing
these certificates, the over-all gain in total time and savings deposits
was at an annual rate of about 27 per cent in February, slightly more
than recorded in January and significantly above the rate for the fourth
quarter.
Reflecting the sharp advances in private deposits, a modest
decline in Treasury deposits and further reduction in nondeposit sources
of funds, the adjusted credit proxy is estimated to have increased at an
annual rate of 13 per cent in February, a stronger gain than that recorded
in January and in the fourth quarter. Commercial paper indebtedness of
subsidiaries and affiliates and liabilities to foreign branches were
both reduced over the month.

Bank credit. Commercial bank credit (adjusted for loan
transfers between banks and their affiliates) is estimated to have
increased at an annual rate of 12.3 per cent from the last Wednesday
of January to the last Wednesday of February. This is slightly below
the pace of advance for January but considerably stronger than that
for the fourth quarter of last year. Security acquisitions, although
below the exceptionally strong gains recorded in December and January,
remained quite large, about $2.6 billion, and accounted for somewhat
more than half of the total credit advance. Growth in total loans21.8

(adjusted for transfers) was also fairly substantial, nearly matching
the strong advance recorded in January. A further pick-up in the rate
of business loan expansion, to an annual rate of about 13 per cent,
paced the increase in total loans.
An increase in holdings of Treasury securities was respon-
sible for about 40 per cent of the increase in total investments.
Coinciding with this expansion, the maturity composition of Treasury
portfolios was markedly restructured as banks acquired a large volume
of longer-term issues, primarily those with 7-year maturities and a
6-1/4 per cent coupon, in exchange for rights during the Treasury's
midmonth refinancing operation. Bank holdings of other securities also
expanded substantially further in February, but the gain was well short
of the exceptionally sharp increases recorded in the November-January
period. Growth in holdings of longer-term municipals continued, although
at a somewhat reduced pace. Holdings of short-term municipals and
Federal agency issues were also increased.
The advance in total loans (adjusted for transfers) was at
an annual rate of 7.8 per cent. In addition to the expansion in busi-
ness loans, gains were recorded in most other loan categories except
loans to nonbank financial institutions, which remained unchanged, and
loans to brokers and dealers, which dropped sharply. The advance in
real estate loans, while still moderate, appears to be somewhat above
the average monthly increase recorded in the fourth quarter.
The strong advance in business loans in February appears to be
partly attributable, as was the turnaround in January, to a temporary

III -5
cutback in the volume of loans being repaid with proceeds from capital
market financings. But after allowing for this factor, growth still
appears quite substantial, with stronger than seasonal gains recorded
in several industry lines. While the general expansion in business
loans may reflect stepped-up loan demands arising in conjunction with
the first quarter bulge in business activity, it also appears that
banks are seeking loans more aggressively--as suggested by the January 31
loan commitment survey (see Appendix A).

Nonbank depositary intermediaries. Deposit inflows to both
mutual savings banks and savings and loan associations during January
were even stronger than early indications had suggested, and these

III -6
inflows have apparently continued large at least through the first half
of February. The recent backup in corporate bond yields, discussed in
a subsequent section, should not have much impact on thrift institution
flows, because in the securities markets most competitive with deposits--
short-term Government and Agency issues--the rate advantage for deposits
has widened. Indeed, deposit inflows have been so exceptionally large
that thrift institutions are expected to continue to de-emphasize their
promotion of accounts and to require stricter nonrate terms--such as
larger minimum balances--on deposits. While there is now no substantive
evidence of cuts in offering rates at nonbank thrift institutions, the
staff also expects rate adjustments to develop soon at these institutions.

p/ Preliminary.S&L data have
difficulties
1/ News articles have suggested that the most immediate form of "rate
cutting" was the cessation of offering, or restriction of terms on,
higher-rate accounts. This is borne out to a limited extent by a
survey of Massachusetts mutual savings banks' deposit offering rates
as of January 31, 1971--the only systematic data available since the
sharp drop in short-term market yields. The principal change that had
occurred since the October 31 survey of these institutions was that many
had stopped offering daily interest crediting. There were no cutbacks
in the rates being offered on regular or special notice accounts--a few
savings banks actually increased their regular account rate--but the
survey unfortunately did not include information on longer term accounts.

III -7
There continues to be evidence that savings and loan associa-
tions are experiencing some difficulty in channeling their vastly
increased fund flows into immediately available new mortgages. During
January, as in December, purchases of mortgages in the secondary market
were made in large volume, and the acquisition of liquid assets reached
a mammoth volume of $1.7 billion--more than half the increase for all
of 1970. Mutual savings banks, on the other hand, have allocated their
increased funds to corporate securities; during January, there was
neither an increase in net mortgage acquisitions nor an increase in
liquid assets held by savings banks.
The exceptionally rapid savings and loan liquid asset rebuild-
ing has brought liquidity ratios to the highs reached during 1967 and
early 1968. Some of this liquidity no doubt represents accumulation to
take up outstanding mortgage commitments and to repay subsidized FHLBB
fixed-term advances--$3.3 billion of which mature in April. There
already has been some modest net repayment by S&L's of borrowed funds,
and while it may represent some prepayment of the fixed-term advances,
the largest part probably represents repayments of other advances.

The Federal Home Loan Bank Board announced an increase in
required liquidity ratios, effective April 1, from 5.5 per cent to
6.5 per cent of the sum of deposits and borrowed funds maturing within
one year. This action is expected to have little immediate impact
because the industry's aggregate liquidity ratio in January already was
approaching 11 per cent.
Mortgage market. Continuation of strong deposit inflows to
thrift institutions has been accompanied by a further buildup of mortgage
commitments in advance of the spring building season, according to field
reports and trade opinion. In January, the S&L's--which have accounted
for most of the recovery--reported a record seasonally adjusted volume
of both new and outstanding mortgage commitments.

III -9
Substantial decreases in mortgage yields have taken place
as the availability of funds has improved. From last fall's record
highs, loan rates paid by homebuyers have dropped more sharply in
absolute terms than during the entire course of any other postwar down-
turn, although current levels are still advanced by pre-1969 standards.
In January, contract rates on conventional first mortgages on new
homes fell by as much as 35 basis points, according to the FHA series,
and a further decline seems probable in February. Moreover, loan-to-
price ratios and maturites for such loans remained close to the December
averages, which were the most liberal in a year and a half, as measured
by the FHLBB series.

III -10
Effective February 18, contract rates on both FHA and VA
mortgages were cut 1/2 of 1 per cent by administrative action, the
third such reduction in as many months. This step brought the ceiling
rate on these Government-underwritten loans down to 7 per cent, compared
with 8-1/2 per cent as recently as last November. Even with the latest
reduction in the ceiling rate, discounts on FHA and VA mortgages bearing
the new 7 per cent rate averaged only 4 points in the March 1 FNMA
auction of its forward purchase commitments. The average auction yield
for 6-month commitments was down to 7.48 per cent, the lowest level
since December 1968.
Corporate and municipal securities markets. Yields on prime
corporate bonds rose over 80 basis points in February, reversing all of
their January decline. An emerging belief that long-term interest
rates, which had declined over 200 basis points since mid-1970, were at
or near their cyclical lows led to buyer resistance in the new issue
market, some liquidation of bonds in the secondary market, and acceler-
ated filing of new issues by prospective borrowers concerned about the
future cost of capital market financing.
Under the pressure of rapidly increasing forward supply and
weaker demand, the corporate bond market underwent a period of sharp
correction in February, with several syndicate terminations and cautious
pricing of new issues by underwriters. Some weakness was also apparent
in the tax-exempt market, where end-of-February yields were about 20
basis points above their January low, as measured by the Bond Buyer

III -11
index. The actual rise in yields was probably greater, since this
index has recently shown some indication of a downward bias.

Even though about $300 million of scheduled bond offerings
were postponed indefinitely or were moved into March during the
unsettled market period in late February, total public bond offerings
for the month were about $2.3 billion, 10 per cent above the average
monthly pace for 1970. Because of the surge of filings and announcements
in late February, the staff estimate for public bond offerings in March
has been raised to a record $3.2 billion. While scheduled offerings are
actually somewhat higher, the staff feels that, given such a large
volume, further postponements and shifting are likely. Therefore, the
April total has been projected at $2.6 billion, which allows for some

III -12
displacement of scheduled March issues into that month; the staff con-
siders the April estimate to be on the low side; the volume may well
be larger.
Bond offerings by financial firms, or financial subsidiaries
of industrial firms, have become increasingly important in the first
quarter of 1971. In particular, a number of banks and bank holding
companies have announced debt issues recently, and there are reports
that there will be more in the near future as banks seek to improve
their capital positions. There has also been a marked increase in
issues and filings, especially in recent weeks, by firms with bond
ratings of Baa or lower and by commercial and consumer-oriented corpor-
ations. Public utility issues still continue at a high level, and the
proportion of offerings by the communications industry in the first
quarter may be even higher than it was last year.

Because of an unusually small volume of new stock issues in
January, estimated monthly average equity issues for the first quarter
of 1971 seem likely to fall below the fourth quarter 1970 average; but
scheduled equity financing appears to be building rapidly now, and both
March and April are estimated at about $1 billion. There is also evi-
dence of an increase in new commitment activity at life insurance
companies, which may be reflected in an upward trend in takedowns in
the second quarter of 1971. Except for the normal seasonal bulge in
December of 1970, takedowns as reported by the SEC have changed little
since mid-1970. Total corporate security offerings for the first
quarter of 1971 are expected to be about 10 per cent below the record-
setting fourth quarter of 1970, but the monthly average estimated for
March and April marks a return to the late 1970 level.

State and local government offerings of long-term securities
in February were well below the January record total, which included
an unusually large volume of revenue bonds. With new issue yields
rising again in late February, some units apparently delayed proposed
offerings. However, the forward calendar remains high, and the staff
expects March and April volume to be around $2 billion each. Even at
higher yields, new issues have been moving rather slowly and there are
reports that bank acquisitions of long-term municipals have slackened
in recent weeks.
Stock market. Although the rapid stock price advances of
the past three months recently have been interrupted, trading volume
continues at record levels. Daily volume, for the NYSE and AMEX
combined, averaged 21.9 million shares in January and 25.6 million
shares in February, compared with a combined average of 15 million
shares for all of 1970.
Fails to deliver--the generally accepted indicator of
brokerage back-office problems--have risen in each of the last seven
months, reflecting this higher share turnover. But, at $1.7 billion,
the February 19 estimated level of fails is still considerably below
the peak of $4.1 billion reached in December 1968.
Financial writers have attributed much of the recent market
activity to heavy institutional trading which, in turn, is thought to
create fewer back-office problems because of the larger size of institu-
tional trades. Analysis of the composition of NYSE transactions

III -15
suggests, however, that institutions have only slightly increased their
relative share of total market activity in recent months and thus,
cannot have been solely responsible for the rise in volume. For example,
trading in blocks of over 10,000 shares--predominantly institutional--
averaged 14 per cent of reported volume on the NYSE during the last six
months of 1970 and about 16 per cent in January 1971. Moreover, trades
of 100 and 200 shares, in which most round lot activity of individual
investors is concentrated, have remained virtually constant as a per-
centage of total trades on the NYSE over the past six months. This
suggests that the alleged reluctance of individuals to participate in
the current market is exaggerated and the recent rise in fails has not
been dampened by institutional trading. The comparatively low rate of
rise in the level of fails in recent weeks is more likely the result
both of efforts to improve back-office efficiency and continued slow
trading in securities most likely to result in fails, particularly OTC
stocks.
Government securities market. Yields on long-term Treasury
issues moved somewhat higher during February in reflection of the
weakening corporate market and changing interest rate expectations.
Bill rates, however, declined by around 80 basis points as the System
worked for progressively easier money market conditions, foreign official
buying became quite heavy, and investors apparently sought short-term
liquidity on the expectation that the broad decline in yields in recent
months had bottomed out. With these rate movements, the spread of the

III -16
10-year Treasury yield over the 3-month bill rate widened from about
190 to around 270 basis points, a wider divergency between these rates
than even in mid-1967 and nearly a 150 basis points greater spread than
in late summer when yields began generally to move lower.

Downward pressures on short-term rates were intensified by
relatively low dealer bill positions in the month. Some small relief
for this situation was provided by the Treasury offering on February 18
of a $1.2 billion "strip" of bills in the 3- to 6-month maturity range;
however, many of the underwriting banks chose to retain their awards of
the "strip", and dealer bill positions were increased relatively little.

The market for Treasury notes and bonds responded favorably
to the $619 million of System purchases of coupon issues, of which
$38 million were in the over-5-year maturity area. These purchases,
which were undertaken over the course of five separate operations,
brought total System purchases of coupon issues since late November to
$1.3 billion, with $582 million of that amount in over-5-year maturities.
While the weakening corporate bond market offset the effect of System
buying in long maturities and yields on 10- and 20-year Treasury issues
have pushed higher, intermediate Treasury yields are 25 to 30 basis
points lower than in early February. In the longer-term market, the

III -18
yield increases on Government issues have been smaller than in the
private market, and thus the spread between new Aaa-rate corporate
yields and the 10-year Treasury yield has widened to around 1-1/2 per-
centage points, compared with a one percentage point in January and an
historically "normal" spread of less than one percentage point.
The market for Federal agency securities has been quiet for
the most part. The FHLB continued to repay debt in February by not
refinancing a $600 million maturing issue. Other agency issues raised
only about $600 million in net new money in the month, more than half
of which was accounted for by FNMA which issued $700 million of new
securities, $200 million of which were 12-1/4 year maturities, to
replace a $350 million maturity. The cash proceeds of this FNMA issue
are expected to be used to begin retiring $1.0 billion of FNMA discount
notes.
Other short-term credit markets. During January seasonally
adjusted commercial and finance company paper outstanding fell $552
million to $33.0 billion. Declines totaling $1.1 billion in bank-
related paper and finance company paper were only partially offset by a
$517 million rise in dealer paper.
The continuing increase in dealer paper outstanding is
apparently attributable to the differential between the cost of bank
borrowing and the issue price of commercial paper, which has made paper
a more attractive source of short-term funds for corporations with
access to the market. The rate spread between bank loans and commercial

III -19
paper is again large despite the decline in the prime rate to 5-3/4 per
cent in early February. Commercial paper rates moved down further in
the week of February 24, to a 4 to 4-3/4 per cent range.
Finance company paper, which showed a seasonally adjusted
decline of only $285 million during the GM strike, fell $750 million
during January. This large decline in a period of recovery in automo-
bile sales may reflect in part the aggressive competition of commercial
banks, which have been bidding actively to make consumer loans in the
automotive area.
Declines in short-term interest rates ranged from 15 to 100
basis points during February, continuing their downward movement.
Finance company paper rates have fallen particularly sharply; one-month
paper rates fell to 3-1/4 per cent in the week of February 17-February 24,
a level that was lower than the prevailing bill rate, but subsequently
finance company rates rose somewhat. Declines in CD rates tended to lag
behind the continued downward movement in bill rates during most of
February, but since February 24 CD issuing rates have declined further.

Federal finance. While there have been no major new fiscal
policy actions since the last Greenbook, recent experience has indicated
a shortfall in receipts and also somewhat higher expenditures relative
to earlier staff estimates for fiscal 1971. Reflecting this, receipts
on a unified budget basis are now estimated to be $193.4 billion (com-
pared to the earlier estimate of $194.2 billion), while the estimate of
outlays has been increased by $300 million to $213.3 billion. This
results in an estimated budget deficit for fiscal 1971 of $19.9 billion.
The fiscal 1972 projections have not been changed.
The staff downward revision in fiscal 1971 receipts is
accounted for by corporate taxes, where current declarations have been
running low and refunds unusually high. There is also some uncertainty
in regard to the administrative acceleration of withheld tax payments
that was effective February 1, which involves an expected boost of $1
billion in fiscal year 1971 receipts. This acceleration has not yet
shown up in actual tax receipts, and thus is now expected to increase
tax receipts in March rather than in February, as earlier estimated.
The upward revision in fiscal 1971 budget outlays results
from higher than expected outlays during the past six weeks; preliminary
data on outlays have not provided any firm indication of previsely which
expenditure categories are running high. The timing of the increase in
social security payments is in some doubt. Board staff is still project-
ing a 10 per cent increase in benefits, but passage is unlikely before
the end of March. The staff is projecting retroactive payments by the
end of May, but this now looks like the earliest possible date for these

III -23
payments, and the resulting boost in consumer spending power could be
delayed until the third quarter if the preparation of checks takes a
longer time than the staff has allowed for.
Staff projections of the high employment budget remain sub-
stantially unchanged: a small surplus is still projected for the
current quarter, followed by a temporary deficit in the second quarter
that reflects the estimated timing of the retroactive social security
checks. This results in a high-employment deficit of about $1 billion
for fiscal 1971, with a similar deficit projected for fiscal 1972.
The deficits being incurred this year and next will require
an increase very shortly in the Federal debt ceiling. The House Ways
and Means Committee has approved an increase in the debt ceiling level
from $395 billion to $430 billion, along with removal of the interest
ceiling on government bonds for $10 billion of new issues. The redemption
of tax anticipation bills on March 22 is expected to provide some tempo-
rary leeway under the now existing debt ceiling, and is expected to leave
room for a $2 billion financing operation in late March, probably in the
form of an offering of Treasury bills. Additional sizable Treasury
borrowing will be needed in early April, which presumably will not be
possible under the existing debt ceiling. However, Congressional action
on the new debt ceiling may be completed by the end of March, allowing
the April financing to take place as scheduled.

THE ECONOMIC PICTURE IN DETAIL
International Developments
U.S. balance of payments. The payments deficit on the
liquidity basis appears to have worsened considerably in January-
February. Preliminary data indicate an unadjusted deficit for the
two months of over $1-l/2 billion, apart from SDR allocations and
special transactions. The seasonal adjustment is probably small.
At this rate the deficit in the first quarter would be far above
the $3 billion annual rate of the last half of 1970.
The factors responsible for this deterioration can presently
be identified only in small part. The trade surplus, which had been
at an annual rate of $3 billion in the third quarter of 1970 and
$3/4 billion in the fourth quarter, was virtually zero in January,
as discussed below. The limited information now available on
identifiable capital flows seems generally favorable. Bank-reported
claims on foreigners were reduced by $1/2 billion in January, con-
siderably more than the inflow which customarily occurs in that month,
reversing the larger-than-usual outflows of December. U.S. purchases
of foreign securities remained relatively small, apart from a $200
million issue by the World Bank. Net foreign purchases of U.S. stocks
were about $150 million (based on incomplete data), about the same as
the high rate of the fourth quarter of 1970. Although sales of Euro-
bonds in January by U.S. firms were quite small, there was a sizable

IV -2
pick-up in February to $150 million, including a $50 million con-
vertible issue by the Ford Company, the first such offering in some
time. With the strong upturn in the U.S. stock market, U.S. corporations
may be able to find renewed acceptance for convertible debentures
abroad to finance their foreign direct investment outlays.
On the official settlements basis, the January-February
deficit (not seasonally adjusted) apparently considerably exceeded
$2 billion, approaching the record rate of the last quarter of 1970,
even though repayments of Euro-dollar borrowings have been smaller.
In January the decline in liabilities to foreign branches (apart from
the reduction of $1 billion connected with the purchase of Export-
Import Bank notes) was very small, but in February it may have been
about $3/4 billion.
U.S. foreign trade. According to preliminary data, the
trade balance in January fell to nearly zero, as imports advanced
by a very sharp 7 per cent from December while exports increased
more moderately -- by about 4-1/2 per cent. This extended the
steady deterioration in the trade balance since mid-1970,when for
two months peak surpluses of $5 billion, at a seasonally adjusted annual
rate (balance-of-payments basis), were recorded. Most of this shrink-
age stems from a sharp acceleration in the growth of imports by value,
partly reflecting higher prices. Imports rose from an annual rate
of $39 billion in the first half of 1970, to $40 billion in the third
quarter, and over $41 billion in the fourth quarter. In December and

IV -3
January, imports averaged $42.3 billion at an annual rate, about
11 per cent higher than in the same period a year earlier.
Imports of all major commodities, except crude oil and fuel
oil, increased in January. Coffee imports rose in order to rebuild
inventories, drawn down in the fourth quarter with the expectation that
lower prices would result from expanded international coffee quotas.
Increased imports of building materials, such as lumber, plywood, and
glass, appear to be in response to the resurgence in housing starts.
Steel imports continued their upward climb partly because of hedge
buying in anticipation of a summer steel strike. Imports of
machinery, particularly office machines and textile equipment, rose
sharply, while auto imports from Canada recovered somewhat from the
fourth quarter low caused by the GM strike. Imports of other nonfood
consumer goods -- televisions and radios, furniture, clothing, footwear,
and tape recorders -- showed large gains, despite the continued slack in
overall domestic consumer demand.
The trend of total exports in recent months has not produced
as many surprises as the rise in imports. The January increase in
exports made up for a dip in November and December, resulting partly
from the GM strike. The December-January average annual rate of
$42.8 billion was about 8 per cent above the same period a year earlier.
In January, sizable increases occurred in machinery exports,
which had fallen off somewhat at the end of last year. Shipments of

IV -4
automotive equipment showed a steep rise, especially in exports of
parts to Canada and to other areas, reflecting the recovery from the
GM strike. Exports of agricultural commodities expanded further in
January from the already high levels prevailing throughout 1970.
Deliveries of commercial aircraft, which are expected to rise in the
next few months, declined slightly in January.
Euro-dollar market. Following a temporary firming in
late January and early February, Euro-dollar rates declined more
rapidly than U.S. money market rates through most of February --
resulting in a narrowing of the excess of Euro-dollar rates over the
cost of domestic funds to U.S. banks in comparable maturities, and a
widening of spreads between European national money market rates and
Euro-dollar rates.

Gross liabilities of U.S. banks to their foreign branches
declined about $3/4 billion from February 3 to 24, to a total of
$6.8 billion. Partial data available through March 1 show a further
decline in borrowings of about $125 million.
In the four week Euro-dollar reserve requirement computation
period ended February 17, the banks' daily average borrowings plus
foreign branch holdings of special Ex-Im Bank securities were about
$280 million lower than in the previous period. In February 18 -
March 1, average borrowings were down further, by about $1 billion.
An additional Ex-Im note offering of $1/2 billion was made on February 26,
with payment to be made on March 3.
Foreign Exchange Markets. The dollar was at the floor against
nearly all major foreign currencies in the exchange markets in February.
Central banks of the EEC countries, the U.K., Switzerland, and Canada
made net spot and forward purchases of dollars totaling about $2.9
billion for the month, a record amount for a period apparently free of
speculative flows. These reserve gains reflected both the underlying
U.S. balance of payments and -- we believe -- sizable interest-induced
flows of capital. The major reserve gainers in February were the U.K.
and Germany which had total net purchases of dollars in the amounts of
$1.4 billion and $960 million, respectively.
One notable element of central bank exchange market intervention
during the period was the extensive forward market operations
conducted by the Bank of England and, to a lesser extent, by the German

IV -6
Federal Bank. Both the U.K. and Germany are trying to hold to relatively
restrictive monetary policies, desired for domestic reasons but
threatened by continuing interest-induced inflows of funds. By selling
their own currencies in the forward market the two central banks are
switching market demand for their domestic currencies (and their own
net purchases of dollars) from the spot market to the forward market.
To the extent that this is accomplished, the central bank's purchases
of dollars and the consequent additions to the domestic monetary base
are postponed, making it easier for the central bank to continue for
a time a monetary policy out of phase with U.S. monetary policy. The
Bank of England in February had net forward sales of sterling (purchases
of dollars) of roughly $600 million, mainly in the form of swaps.
The Bundesbank, operating through the Federal Reserve Bank of New York
in the New York market, had net (outright) forward sales of marks
(purchases of dollars) amounting to about $225 million between
February 25, when the operations began, and March 2. A specific
aim of the German operations is to reduce the covered-interest differential
in favor of movements into DM; it was hoped that this could be done
without a large volume of transactions, but whether that will be
possible is still to be seen.
In other official operations in February, the System drew
$155 million on the swap facility with the National Bank of Belgium
and $150 million on the line with the Swiss National Bank, providing

IV -7
exchange cover for those banks' dollar intake. Outstanding indebtedness
now amounts to $385 million on the Belgian line and $450 million on
the Swiss line. On March 5, the System will repay the remaining
$75 million equivalent on the Dutch line, using existing System
DM balances.

IV -8
Interest rates in major industrial countries abroad. Despite
some reduction in demand pressures, monetary authorities in most European
countries and Japan have continued to be concerned over rising prices
and costs. Consequently, they have either maintained a restrictive
policy stance (as in Germany, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom)
or have relaxed monetary conditions only gradually (as in France, Italy,
and Japan). Hence, while interest rates in these countries have been
influenced in recent months by rate declines in this country and in
the Euro-dollar market, and have generally declined, they have remained
at much higher levels than rates in the U.S. and Euro-dollar markets,
and the resulting differentials have given rise to heavy capital flows.
In some cases, the differentials have widened in recent weeks; short-
term rates have not declined much in Germany since January, and have
actually risen in the United Kingdom.
Canadian monetary policy remains moderately expansive. While
short-term interest rates there firmed for a time early this year, they
have fallen to new lows since last week's discount rate reduction.
Canadian official reserve gains of about $200 million since last
September have not been the result of unusually large capital inflows.
Official reserves of the EEC countries and the United Kingdom
have risen by more than $7 billion since last September, most of which
probably has resulted from net capital inflows. A large portion of
Japan's reserve gains of roughly $1 billion during this period is also
attributable to capital inflows.
Capital flows into Germany and the United Kingdom have been
particularly massive. Central banks of these countries and of one or

IV -9
two other countries that have also been anxious to continue monetary
restraint have taken measures to neutralize -- at least in part --
the secondary expansionary effects of capital inflows. The Bank of
England and the Netherlands Bank have made sizable dollar swaps with
commercial banks. The Bundesbank raised reserve requirements on all
deposits in December. The Bank of England has severely restricted
short- and medium-term borrowing of foreign currencies by U.K. firms,
and both central banks have sought to sop up excess liquidity through
open market sales of government securities: short- and medium-term
in Germany and long-term in the United Kingdom. Swps with commercial
banks tend to postpone rather than permanently neutralize the secondary

1/ Rates are monthly averages except for Belgium, where the begin-
ning-of-month yield is shown, and Euro-bonds, where the end-of-month
yield is cited. Yields are for long-term government and public sector
bonds except as follows: the Euro-bond yield is a composite of 10
dollar-denominated issues of U.S. companies; for Italy, the composite
yield is for all bonds except Treasury bonds; for Japan, a composite
yield of private industrial bonds is shown. The French yield is net
of withholding tax, the gross yield being approximately one percentage
point higher. Latest yields are for the dates in parentheses.

In Germany, most short-term. interest rates receded from
around 9 per cent in September to about 7-1/2 per cent in January,
where they have since stabilized. Money market conditions in Germany
remain tight, partly because banks' reserve requirements were raised
on December 1, partly because the Bundesbank has made sizable open
market sales to nonbanks since November, and partly because the
banks -- expecting interest rate declines in the near future -- have
been buying medium-term paper from the Bundesbank. In addition,
growth of currency in circulation has tended to offset the commercial
banks' reserve gains from foreign exchange transactions. Long-term
rates have also declined in recent months.
Last week interest rates in Germany firmed again: bond
yields moved up, and the call money rate rose to 7-5/8 per cent on
March 2.
Most short-term rates in the United Kingdom are now as high
as or higher than they were at the beginning of the year. Signalling
its determination to continue the fight against inflation -- retail
price in January were 8-1/2 per cent higher than a year earlier --
the Bank of England has kept its Bank Rate at 7 per cent, to which it
was reduced in April 1970. The rise in some rates reflects tightness
in sterling money markets since the turn of the year, and also expecta-
tions of declining long-term rates.
In a bullish bond market, the Bank of England has been vigorously
selling government bonds, thereby restricting growth in money supply,

IV -12
holding down bank liquidity, and keeping interest rates high. Bank loans
levelled off in the fourth quarter of 1970 and actually fell in January
of this year, largely because of the Bank of England's insistence that
restraint be observed. A ban was placed on British businesses' foreign
currency borrowing of under five year maturity on January 22, 1971.
The widening spread between high uncovered British yields and
falling yields elsewhere resulted last month in large inflows of short-
term funds as well as in speculative foreign demand for British bonds.
The Bank of England swapped $650 million of its $1 billion February
reserve gain to banks, thereby postponing the impact on bank liquidity.
In France, short-term interest rates declined sharply after the
turn of the year while long-term rates fell only marginally. The Bank of
France has resisted pressures to lower its discount rate from 6.5 per cent,
to which it was reduced on January 8, but it has allowed the money market
intervention rate to fall below the discount rate in order to keep market
rates more or less level with Euro-dollar rates. In recent weeks the Bank
has been setting its money market intervention rate somewhere between the
call Euro-dollar rate and the (higher) British and German money market
rates.
Interest rates in Italy have declined considerably since last
summer. A new interbank agreement, in effect since September, places
ceilings on deposit interest rates much lower than the rates being paid
last August. The downward pressure that this agreement exerted on other
short-term interest rates has been somewhat accentuated by expectations

IV -13
of less buoyant aggregate demand in Italy. Increased confidence in the
lira is another factor. On January 9, the Bank of Italy reduced its
rate on advances from 5-1/2 to 5 per cent, in part because demand
pressures seemed to be lessening.
In Belgium, short-term interest rates have declined much less
than Euro-dollar rates. The National Bank, concerned about upward price
pressures from the value-added tax introduced in January, has permitted
only a moderate relaxation of monetary tightness. Belgian long-term bond
yields remain high. Large capital inflows have contributed to a $350
million rise so far this year in the National Bank's reserves.
The Netherlands Bank is maintaining its restrictive ceiling on
private short-term credit expansion as demand and cost pressures persist.
Accelerated fund inflows since the turn of the year have eased the seasonal
pressure on the money market, but the Bank has been swapping guilders for
dollars to commercial banks, usually on a 3-month basis.
In Canada, short-term interest rates were declining at a rate
faster than comparable U.S. rates from March to August last year, but
remained steady between late December through late February while U.S.
rates continued to drop. This development put the Canadian dollar under
further upward pressure and the floating rate rose steadily to a high of
$99.80 on February 22 in spite of a quarter-point reduction in the discount
rate on February 15. The Bank of Canada again lowered its discount rate
on February 24, this time by half a percentage point. This second reduction
has resulted in a comparable drop in the chartered banks' prime rate, and
Canadian Treasury bills dropped sharply to below 4 per cent in the last
week of February.

IV -14
Long-term yields in Canada declined rapidly between November
and January, reducing the differential against U.S. yields to an extraor-
dinarily low level. In the last quarter of 1970, new Canadian bond issues
abroad made up a markedly lower share of total issues.
The Bank of Japan has been following a moderately expansionary
policy since late last summer and has lowered its discount rate twice --
on October 28 and January 20. Since U.S. rates have been declining more
than Japanese rates, there has been some shift from yen to dollar financing
of Japanese exports and imports, tending to add to the Bank of Japan's
rapidly growing reserves. To discourage this shift, the Bank lowered its
accommodation rates for domestic financing of imports on January 20 and on
March 1 abolished the quarter-point charge on dollar swaps in connection
with its loans for imports.

APPENDIX A: LOAN COMMITMENT SURVEY*
The results of the January 31 Survey of Bank Loan Commitments
give additional evidence that credit conditions at commercial banks have
eased further. More than 75 per cent of the Survey participants reported
an easing in commitment policies while none reported a tightening. About
60 per cent of the banks that indicated they had eased their policies
cited both weak loan demands and increased availability of funds as
responsible for this change. Another 30 per cent attributed the change
solely to an improvement in fund availability while the remainder pointed
only to weak loan demands.
The improvement in available supplies of loanable funds
appears to have been much more substantial than the weakening in loan
demands, as the volume of new commitment during the 3-month period ending
January 31 was more than $4 billion above the volume for the preceding
3-month period. C and I firms received the lion's share of the increase
with confirmed lines of credit and term loans and revolving credits show-
ing the largest gains. Commitments extended to nonbank financial
institutions--notably finance companies--also exhibited a healthy rise.
Commitments for real estate mortgages and construction loans also
increased and reached a level higher than recorded in any previous survey.
Takedowns, expirations and cancellations
Takedowns, expirations and cancellations of commitments
during the past three months were somewhat larger than what was reported
in the October, 1970, survey, but well below the volume reported in the
three prior surveys in 1970. Most banks do not anticipate much change
in the volume of takedowns in the next three months. However, about
20 per cent are expecting some decline.
Unused Commitments
Total unused commitments rose to highest level recorded since
the initiation of this survey in January of 1969. The total commitments
available to C&I firms on January 31 were about $2.8 billion higher than
in October and more than $3 billion above the previous high occurring in
October, 1969.
