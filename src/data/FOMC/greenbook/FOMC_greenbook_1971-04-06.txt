SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK
Nonfinancial
We are now estimating an increase of $27.5 billion in current
dollar GNP in the first quarter. This is $1-1/2 billion below our pro-
jection of four weeks ago, reflecting a number of small downward revi-
sions in categories of final sales. Available information on inven-
tory investment is still very limited. Our current estimate is that
real GNP increased at an annual rate of 6.5 per cent compared to about
7 per cent in our previous projection.
Apart from housing, recent economic information has not been
on the ebullient side. Most of the unusually large expansion in GNP in
the first quarter arose from the special and temporary circumstances in
autos and steel, Auto assemblies in March remained at the advanced
February annual rate of 9 million units; but the period of rebuilding
of dealer stocks appears to be at or near an end with second quarter
assemblies now scheduled to be cut to an 8.2 million rate, close to the
first quarter rate of sales of domestic units.
Retail sales apart from autos are estimated to have risen
moderately in March, but for the first quarter as a whole were little
changed from the fourth quarter. New orders for durable goods changed
in February but orders for capital equipment, which have been rising
irregularly for some time, were off. Sharply revised manufacturers'

I-2
inventory book value data for January and preliminary data for February
indicate little net change over these two months, following moderate
increases in the second half of 1970, and the stock-sales ratios has
declined to about the pre-strike level. Unemployment compensation data
for March suggest continued weakness in the demand for labor. The rise
in the consumer price index slowed considerably in January and February,
with sharp declines in mortgage interest rates on important influence.
Outlook. We are now projecting an increase of $17 billion in
current dollar GNP in the second quarter, with an increase of 2.7 per
cent in real GNP, annual rate. The fall-off from the first quarter
reflects the ending of the temporary auto recovery boost and the anti-
cipated tapering of the upsurge in housing activity. The second quarter
figures are below our previous projections, however, mainly because of a
cut-back in the projected increase of consumer spending. The retroactive
increase in social security benefits as enacted will provide some $5
billion (annual rate) less than we had assumed in personal income and
is being paid out in late June rather than in May. On the other hand,
a moderate increase in business spending on fixed capital is now projected,
in line with the latest Commerce-SEC survey.
The third quarter projections of both current dollar and real
GNP have been raised appreciably. The retroactive increase in social
security benefits, because of the lateness of the payment, should have a
more expansive effect on third quarter consumer spending than assumed

I-3
earlier. Moreover, the projection now incorporates an assumed substantial
increase in military pay scales, effective July 1, in a move towards
establishment of a volunteer army. For the second half of the year--
still assuming a two-month steel strike ending around the end of Sept-
ember--we now project real GNP to increase at an annual rate of 4.3
per cent, compared to 3.7 per cent in the preceding Greenbook.
The unemployment rate is now expected to approach 6-1/2 per
cent by mid-year, but to change little thereafter as expansion in employ-
ment about matches growth in the labor force. Continued sharp increases
in labor compensation are expected to be offset to a greater extent than
in recent years by productivity gains; the rise in the GNP deflator is
still expected to slow to an annual rate of about 3.5 per cent in the
fourth quarter.
Financial
Financial market sentiment changed notably during March, as
evidence accumulated that economic recovery was less rapid and credit
availability greater than many market participants had expected. A
record March volume of over $6 billion of public issues of corporate
and tax-exempt bonds were sold at rapidly declining yields; and by the
end of the month most of the previous increase in long-term rates had
been erased, with yields on 10-year Treasury issues falling to the lowest
level in 3 years. On the other hand, short-term rates--with the exception
of the prime and CD offering rates--increased somewhat on balance in
March partly in reflection of a new round of Treasury bill financing and
somewhat firmer money market conditions.

I-4
Further cuts in rates on both loans and time and savings
deposits at commercial banks occurred in March as deposit inflows contin-
ued large and loan growth slowed. Consumers, in particular, continued to
acquire time and savings deposits at a near record pace and--with the
exception of U.S. Government deposits--other deposit categories also
rose sharply. With most sectors of the economy still sluggish and with
increased repayments of bank loans from the proceeds of the enlarged
volume of capital market financing, business loans probably declined
in March (after seasonal adjustment). In these circumstances, banks
placed most of their new funds in the securities markets.
Nonbank depository institutions also maintained an unusually
rapid pace of deposit growth, despite reports of widening cuts in offer-
ing rates. While their mortgage closings and commitments apparently
continued to expand, the S and L's again increased their already large
holdings of liquid assets. Savings banks, on the other hand, with
their greater asset diversification, have been able to use their large
inflows to acquire a significant volume of corporate securities.
Outlook. Growth of business loans at commercial banks over
the early spring will probably continue to be limited by loan repayments
from the proceeds of capital market financing. And the continuing rate
advantage of commercial paper over even the newly lowered prime rate
should also tend to divert credit demands from banks. If these substi-

I -5
tutions for business financing at banks do remain significant, the prime
rate may once again come under downward pressure. In any event, cuts
in the rates on consumer-type time and savings deposits are likely to
spread as flows to banks from this source remain large and banks' desire
for funds is dampened by sluggish net loan demand. In such an environ-
ment, banks can be expected to continue to repay Euro-dollar borrowings,
to remain unaggressive in competing for short-term CD funds, to continue
a high rate of security acquisitions, and to increase their pace of
construction and real estate lending.
The upward pressure on short-term interest rates arising from
the recent bunching of sizable new Treasury bill offerings seems unlikely
to persist. The Treasury is still expecting to repay some debt on balance
over the second quarter, although in considerably less than seasonal
amounts, and may elect to pre-refund some shorter maturities under its
new leeway to borrow outside the 4-1/4 per cent interest rate ceiling.
The housing agencies are expected to retire substantial amounts of matur-
ing debt this spring. Finally, finance companies, like banks, will
probably continue to tap money markets at a reduced rate, while corpora-
tions and State and local governments can be expected to continue placing
much of the proceeds of their capital markets offerings temporarily in
short-term financial assets.

I-6
In long-term markets, although most recently the bond market
rally has stalled, further net yield declines seem likely between now
and mid-year. Corporate bond volume, while still very large by histori-
cal standards, is expected to moderate in the second quarter since many
large corporations apparently have completed their funding operations.
The large volume of available funds at thrift institutions and banks
is likely to keep downward pressure on mortgage rates, although the
current seasonal pickup in demand for mortgage funds may tend to moderate
the extent of decline. Finally, with banks likely to have a continued
excess of funds available for investment, and with a somewhat reduced
forward calendar of issues, tax-exempt yields may well decline further.
International developments and the balance of payments
We have again revised downward substantially our projection
of the balance on goods and services for the year 1971, to about $2-1/2
billion compared with $3.7 billion in 1970. The recovery in the trade
balance in February was disappointingly small, and recent data suggest
that import demand in leading foreign countries may be weakening more
than we earlier expected. The U.S. trade surplus was at an annual rate
of only $1/2 billion in January-February, and is now projected to decline
somewhat further during the year.
The over-all payments deficit, however measured, reached record
levels in the first quarter: about $2-1/2 billion on the liquidity basis
and nearly $5 billion on the official settlements basis (not annual rates).

I-7
In addition to the deterioration on current transactions, there must
have been a very large increase in net capital outflows.
Probably net outflows of corporate funds have rebounded to the
very high levels of early 1970. Foreign plant and equipment outlays of
affiliates of U.S. corporations are expected to increase 16 per cent
this year, after a rise of 22 per cent in 1970; with U.S. credit conditions
easing, corporations are likely to use as much U.S.-source financing as
the restraint programs will allow. Repayments of Euro-dollar borrowings
by U.S. banks continued large through March. Meanwhile, net inflows of
foreign funds into U.S. equities dwindled to almost zero in February.
Finally, the size of the deficit implies that net outflows of short-term
funds not covered by restraint programs have risen, presumably in response
to the large international interest rate differentials recently prevail-
ing. These differentials are expected to diminish as a result of rate
reductions in Europe; central bank discount rates were reduced by 1/2
per cent in Belgium effective March 25 and by 1 per cent in Germany
effective April 1. But differentials in market rates could remain
sizable for several more months at least.

THE ECONOMIC PICTURE IN DETAIL
Domestic Nonfinancial Scene
Gross national product. We now estimate that the first
quarter rise in GNP will be slightly smaller than projected a month
ago--about $27-1/2 billion instead of $29 billion. The shortfall
from last month's GNP projections reflects small revisions in a
number of items. Practically all sectors appear to be performing
about as we had expected, however. The post-strike rebound in auto
and truck production continues to dominate the rise in overall
activity, contributing about $20 billion of the estimated rise in GNP.
Unit sales of domestic autos through the first 20 days of
March have not been impressive--continuing close to the 8.1 million
annual rate we had projected for the quarter last month; nevertheless,
this total is some 2-3/4 million units above the strike-reduced fourth
quarter rate. Among other retail sales, furniture and appliances
sales have recovered well, but nondurables sales were weaker than
expected, and apparently only slightly higher in the first quarter
than in the fourth. We have therefore reduced our estimate of consumer
outlays slightly.
Although exports apparently improved somewhat in the first
quarter, imports rose even faster and our estimate of net exports
has also been revised down somewhat. The greater strength of imports
reflected both continued strong demand for foreign automobiles and
other consumer items as well as increased imports of steel, presumably
as part of the stockpiling in anticipation of a possible strike in
early August.

II -2
With the number of residential housing starts for February
about the same as in January, the average for the quarter is expected
to fall short of our earlier projections by about 50,000 units; in
addition, the average price per unit has fallen somewhat, and we have
cut the increase in estimated outlays by $.8 billion. Our projections
of residential construction outlays have also been reduced slightly
for the year as a whole, reflecting both the smaller increase now
expected in the construction of Federally supported units, and a
lower unit cost now expected as a result of the increased importance
of low and moderate income housing under the subsidy programs now in
effect.
Other major components of our preceding GNP projection for
the first quarter remain essentially unchanged. We still anticipate
a quite modest volume of nonfarm inventory investment--$2 billion,
annual rate--with continued strike-hedge accumulation of steel and a
post-strike build-up of auto stocks largely offset by liquidation in
some other lines.
Our estimate of business fixed investment for the first
quarter has been raised slightly as a result of some additional strength
in nonresidential construction outlays and in shipments of capital
equipment. The new Commerce-SEC survey of business spending plans
also suggests a somewhat larger increase than formerly, both for this
quarter and for the remainder of the year.

It now appears likely that GNP growth in the second quarter
will slow down more rapidly than earlier expected following the post-
strike first quarter rebound. This revision reflects largely the
difference between the recently enacted increase in social security
benefits (10 per cent retroactive to the first of the year), and what
we had earlier assumed.3.9

II -4
Thus, the actual legislation omits reforms which we had
assumed would be incorporated (including an increase in the minimum
benefit to $100 monthly) and results in a smaller than expected
increase in personal income by almost $5 billion (annual rate). The
postponement of the wage base increase is reflected in taxes and
income beginning in the first quarter, according to OBE accounting
procedures, and we have made this adjustment.
In addition, the retroactive social security benefits are
now scheduled to be paid out near the end of June; we had assumed
a somewhat earlier distribution. Under the current estimated timing,
payments probably will not have much effect on consumption until the
third quarter. As a result of these two factors, we are now projecting
a $2 billion smaller second quarter rise in consumption. We have
added a small increase in business fixed investment in line with the
results of the latest Commerce-SEC survey. GNP in the second quarter
is now projected to rise by $17 billion.
Our GNP projections point to a somewhat stronger second
half than was previously anticipated, despite the fact that we continue
to expect a steel strike lasting about 60 days, which will reduce the
rise of inventory investment by $4 billion. Nevertheless, GNP is now
expected to rise by $19 billion during the third quarter, about $5
billion more than previously projected. The new element entering our
calculations is the support provided by the assumed adoption of
military pay increases of about $2-1/2 billion annually, starting

II -5
with the third quarter, as a step towards introduction of a volunteer
army. In addition to this stimulus, personal consumption expenditures
during this quarter should benefit from the impact of the late second
quarter payment of the retroactive increase in social security payments.

We are still projecting a large gain, $25 billion, in GNP
for the fourth quarter, reflecting in part the assumption of a steel
strike settlement by about the end of September. We expect a sizable
rise in inventory investment of $5 billion, following the liquidation
of steel stocks the previous quarter, moderate acceleration in business

fixed investment and a reasonably strong pattern of consumption
relative to strengthening private wages and salary payments.
For the year as a whole, GNP is now projected to average
$1046 billion, virtually unchanged from our last projection. But
a somewhat slower growth is now expected in the first half, with
a correspondingly faster growth in prospect for the second half
year, when the GNP is projected to be rising $22 billion per
quarter. Real growth in the last half, now projected at around
4-1/4 per cent, annual rate, would be about in line with the long-run
growth in output potential. But substantial slack in the economy
would remain, as reflected in a second half unemployment rate expected
to average 6-1/2 per cent.

Industrial production. The available output data for March
are too sketchy for an estimate of the probable change in the production
index. While the fragmentary March data do not show any additional
weakness, nothing is available as to production developments in business
and defense equipment--where recent declines have centered--and in a
large segment of consumer durable goods and industrial materials.
Auto assemblies in the first four weeks of March were at a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 9 million units, the same as in
February. Production schedules for the second quarter indicate an
output rate of 8.2 million units, closely in line with the 8.1 million
unit sales rate prevailing so far this year. Output of television
sets in the first three weeks of March have increased from the reduced
January-February level. Production of household appliances has been
fluctuating in recent months around a level about 10 per cent below
the mid-1970 peak.
Output of business equipment in February was 13 per cent
below the September-October 1969 high. New orders for capital goods
have been rising irregularly since mid-1970 and this suggests that
the decline in business equipment, which has been the largest since
1957-58, may be approaching an end. In March, truck production
changed little but output of commercial aircraft is estimated to have
declined further. Production of defense equipment, which dropped
from an index level of 180 per cent in mid-1968 to 115 per cent by
February 1971, is now only about 7 per cent above the pre-Vietnam
build-up level.

II -11
Retail sales. Retail sales in March appear to be around
1 per cent higher than February, according to estimates based on
weekly data through March 20. Automobile sales maintained the
February sales level, and durable sales as a whole were up by about
1-1/2 per cent. Nondurable goods sales were about 1 per cent higher
than in February, as most major types of outlets reported higher
sales.
Present data indicate that consumer spending on goods in
the first quarter--aside from the recovery of GM model auto sales--
was far from robust. Domestic unit auto sales, adjusted to exclude
the strike rebound effect, appear to be little changed from the weak
rate of sales in the spring of 1970. Retail sales--exclusive of autos,
building materials, and farm equipment--were apparently no higher in
the first quarter than the fourth. First quarter furniture and
appliance sales are estimated about 3 per cent above the fourth
quarter, but sales of these items were sluggish in late 1970, and
the March level is still lower than at the beginning of 1970.

orders andshipments. New orders for durable
goods were unchanged in February, according to preliminary data, rather
than declining as had been indicated by the advance report. The
January-February level of orders was equal to last July's pre-auto-strike
high.
Orders for motor vehicles and parts (measured by shipments
in the case of auto assembly plants) continued their sharp rebound
from strike-depressed levels and were considerably higher in February
than before the strike. Defense orders also rose. But there were
offsetting declines elsewhere, the largest being at iron and steel
mills. This is not inconsistent with continued steel stockpiling in
coming months; in both 1965 and 1968, the two most recent steel contractManufacturers'

II -13
renegotiation periods, steel orders also peaked in January, but users
built inventories throughout the first half of the year. The decline
of 14 per cent in February 1971 was somewhat sharper than in these
two earlier years, probably because the January level was inflated
by the large post-strike auto catchup.
Orders for capital equipment also declined in February.
By late last year, this series had recovered to around the highs of
late 1969, but since then it has declined slightly. Orders for house-
hold and other durables were little changed.

declined at a $3 billion annual rate in February, according to pre-
liminary data. In January, revised data indicate a $2.2 billion
annual rate increase, rather than the $5.4 billion rate decline
reported earlier. The average rate for the two months is quite
close to the zero rate of accumulation which manufacturers anticipated
for the first quarter as a whole.
Steel-using manufacturers built inventories of steel mill
shapes in January and February, but at a rate lower than in earlier
pre-contract periods, suggesting that the impact of stockpiling may
continue to be felt somewhat later this year than in 1965 and 1968.

Retail auto dealers continued to rebuild stocks of new

their stock-sales ratio increased.
Cyclical indicators. The preliminary Census composite index
of leading indicators rose 0.6 per cent further in February, to a
level equal to its previous high of September 1969. The coincident
and lagging composites also rose. Both the leading and the coincident
composite indexes rose less in February than in January.

(H) Current high value. The highs for the coincident composite
were December 1969 and April 1970, and the high for the lagging
composite was September 1970.
Leading series contributing to the February increase were
contracts and orders for plant and equipment, industrial materials
prices, common stock prices, the ratio of price to unit labor costs,
and initial claims for unemployment insurance, which declined slightly
as measured by the special Census series. Series declining were the
manufacturing workweek, new orders for durable goods (revised upwards
since the index was compiled), and housing permits.
Although the leading composite has regained its previous
high, only two if its twelve components have actually come back
strongly from their lows--housing permits, which peaked in December
and have fallen back slightly since then, and common stock prices,
which are still below their earlier peak. Most of the others have
recovered somewhat from lows reached during the GM strike or earlier
in 1970 but are well below their previous highs.

II -17
The reason that the leading composite index shows more
strength than most of its parts is that it is adjusted upward to
incorporate the long-term trend of the coincident composite. The
addition of this trend adjustment to the leading series for the
postwar period improved the consistency of the leads at cycle peaks
and lengthened somewhat the leads at troughs. However, the leads
on upturns are still variable, ranging from two to nine months for
the four postwar cycles.
Residential construction and real estate. Seasonally adjusted
private housing starts in February continued above a 1.7 million annual
rate--except for last December the highest in seven years. With out-
standing mortgage commitments and building permits at or near record
highs in recent months, indications are that the rate of starts increased
in March, although most likely not by enough to bring the first quarter
average above last year's fourth quarter pace.

1/ Apart from starts, mobile home shipments for domestic use in January--
the latest month for which data are available--were at a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 395 thousand, about the same as in December.
2/ Based on unadjusted totals for all periods. FHA-insured starts
include both subsidized and nonsubsidized units.
FHA-insured starts accounted for 27 per cent of total private
starts in February, reflecting mainly the extremely heavy absorption
of funds for subsidized starts. Even though the percentage was far
below the extraordinary figure of last December, the total FHA share
was still relatively high in comparison with 1969, as shown in the table.

II -19
Moreover, the release by mid-March of $45 million in additional funds
for three of HUD's major subsidy programs should provide further
stimulus this spring, in time to have some impact in April. In that
month, unadjusted starts, over-all, normally show a seasonal increase
to a level almost double that in February.
While mortgage markets have eased considerably further since
then, data for January--the latest available--indicate that transactions
in both new and used homes had already expanded appreciably. In fact,
unit sales of new homes by merchant builders in January were seven-
tenths above their early 1970 low and close to the highest rate in the
history of the series which began in 1963. Although the median price
of new homes sold turned upward in January, at $23,700, it remained
well under the $26,000 median for new homes available for sale. The
median price of used homes sold in January was $23,670, according to
the National Association of Real Estate Boards. This was 7 per cent
above a year earlier, about the same as the year-to-year increase in
such prices during all of 1970.
Anticipated plant and equipment expenditures. The February
Commerce-SEC survey indicated that businessmen plan to expand spending
for new plant and equipment in 1971 by 4.3 per cent from 1970. This
increase is larger than indicated in the December survey (1.4 per cent),
partly because of the sharper than anticipated reduction in fourth
quarter 1970 spending. Actual spending in the fourth quarter fell

II -20
$3 billion, due mainly to the greater than anticipated impact of the
GM strike which reduced purchases of motor vehicles and trucks.
Spending for 1970 as a whole totaled $79.7 billion, up 5.5 per cent
from 1969 but only one-half the 10.6 per cent increase planned at
this time last year for 1970.

The February survey indicated a 3.2 per cent rise, at an
annual rate, in first half 1971 outlays--largely attributable to
strong increases planned by electric utilities and communications
firms. In the second half, manufacturing plans indicate an increase
at a 12.3 per cent annual rate compared with a decline of 4.5 per cent
in the first half. On the other hand, communications firms report
plans to cut second half spending and electric utilities plan a much
slower rate of increase than in the first half.

II -21
The latest Conference Board survey of capital appropriations
by manufacturing firms raises some questions in regard to the projected
large increase in outlays in the second half. The Board has reported
that new capital appropriations by the 1,000 largest manufacturers
declined 7.6 per cent in the fourth quarter of 1970, and that the
third quarter increase has been revised downward to 1.6 per cent.
Historical evidence suggests that there is about a three quarter lag
between appropriations and expenditures, which would imply little
strength in manufacturing outlays before the fourth quarter of 1971.
Labor market. Demands for labor continue slack. Initial
claims for unemployment insurance benefits in March are estimated to
have remained about at the rate of the two preceding months. Although
insured unemployment also has shown little net change since December,
exhaustions of regular unemployment benefits have risen considerably.
The new Federal-State extended benefits program, implemented last
October, is now providing benefits to an additional 330,000 workers
in 14 States and Puerto Rico. The rapid rise in the number of workers
drawing extended benefits primarily reflects the addition of more States
to the program. Each State entering the program has a large pool of
workers who had exhausted their benefits before the program began.

Labor force growth. Slack demands for labor apparently
have caused a sharp slowdown in labor force growth. Since mid-1970
the total labor force has averaged only about 1.3 million higher
than a year earlier. This year to year increase is about 200,000
smaller than expected on the basis of population growth and long-
term trends in labor force participation rates and is well below
the large increases of 1969 and early 1970. However,reductions in
the armed forces have tended to maintain increases in the civilian
work force.

The return of veterans has resulted in large increases in
the number of young men aged 20 to 24 years in the civilian labor
force. However, labor force growth for other groups has slowed
significantly, reflecting declines in labor force participation
rates for most groups, and especially older workers. The teenage
participation rate declined slightly after a sharp rise in 1970.
Among women participation rates are still rising, but much more
slowly than in early 1970.

Industrial relations. Wage settlements continue large in new
collective bargaining agreements. After a four week strike, 32,000
can company employees ratified new contracts similar to the National
Can agreement. Wage rates will rise 50 cents in the first year and
12-1/2 cents in both the second and third years. These agreements
also include a cost-of-living escalator clause providing unlimited
quarterly adjustments beginning the second contract year (February
1972) with a guaranteed minimum adjustment of 12-1/2 cents in each
year. In addition, a provision for widening the differential between
job classifications is estimated to increase wage rates an average of
10 cents over the life of the contract. In total, these increases
(including the 25-cent minimum guaranteed cost-of-living adjustment)
amount to $1.10 over the life of the contract and average about 9 per
cent annually. Including an estimate of 40 cents for fringe benefit
improvements, average hourly employment costs also will increase at
least 9 per cent per year. The settlements in the can industry are
likely to provide a pattern for upcoming negotiations in the aluminum,
copper and basic steel industries.
Widespread bargaining in the telephone and telegraph industry
will occur this year as contracts covering 540,000 communication workers
expire between April 30 and early September. Recent union settlements
have called for a 25 per cent wage increase in a one-year contract. Gas
and electric utilities companies will also be negotiating contracts with
about 140,000 workers this year. Consolidated Edison of New York reached
agreement March 14 with 19,000 utility workers on a two-year contract
providing wage increases of 10 per cent the first year and 8 per cent
the second.

II -25
Constructibn wages. Under the authority of the Economic
Stabilization Act of 1970, President Nixon has issued an Executive
Order designed to restrain wage and price increases in construction.
The Order provides for the establishment of a 12-member tripartite
Construction Industry Stabilization Committee to supervise and review
determinations of separate "craft dispute boards". The craft dispute
boards, composed of labor and management representatives, appointed by
employer associations and the national unions, are charged with the
responsibility "to determine....whether wage and salary increases in
the agreement are acceptable" under the criteria established in the
Order and "to provide advice and assistance" in the resolution of
disputes involving wages and salaries. The boards are also authorized
to review wage increases provided in earlier contracts but effective
after March 28 "to determine whether any increase is unreasonably incon-
sistent with the criteria".
After March 28, no negotiated wage increase may be implemented
without approval of a craft board or the Committee or both, without
being in violation of the Order.
Wage and salary increases deemed acceptable by the boards
shall be referred to the Committee, which then has 15 days to either
assume jurisdiction or to validate the board's determination by not
taking any action. Wage and salary increases deemed unacceptable by the
boards are to be reported to the Committee and the Secretary of Labor.

II -26
If the Committee finds any labor settlements unacceptable, the Secretary
of Labor shall assure that unacceptable wage rates not be used in any
Federal or Federally-assisted construction or influence wage determina-
tions under the Davis-Bacon Act, publicize nonconforming settlements,
and take any other action authorized by law to carry out the purposes
and policies of this Order.
The criteria of an acceptable wage increase are: "...those
normally considered supportable by productivity improvement and cost
of living trends, but not in excess of the average of the median
increases in wages and benefits over the life of the contract negotiated
in major construction settlements in the period 1961 to 1968" (about
6 per cent). In addition, equity adjustments may be permitted to
restore traditional relationships among crafts in a single locality
and within the same craft in surrounding localities.
The Order also establishes an Interagency Committee on
construction to develop criteria for the determination of acceptable
prices in construction contracts as well as criteria for acceptable
compensation, including bonuses, stock options and the like.

II -27
Wholesale prices. The final wholesale price index for
February (January 12th to February 9th) differs only slightly from the
preliminary estimate. The 9.1 per cent increase at a seasonally
adjusted annual rate was mainly the result of sharp increases for farm
and food products, as the increase for industrial commodities was one
of the smallest since mid-1969.

Consumer prices. The rise in consumer prices slowed further
in February to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2 per cent, with a sharp
drop in mortgage interest rates as well as declines in gasoline, used cars

and houses. These, together with a levelling in prices on new cars,
moderated continued strong increases for most services and the resumption
of advances for food and apparel.

Sharply declining mortgage costs considerably dampened the
rise in consumer prices in both January and February. Mortgage costs,
which have a weight of over 4 per cent in the CPI, reflect in the BLS
method of computation both changes in mortgage rates and in house
prices. According to confidential BLS estimates, if mortgage costs
had been excluded, consumer prices, not seasonally adjusted, would have
risen at a rate of 4 per cent--instead of 2 per cent--in February. The
recent experience is in contrast to that of the immediately preceding

II -29
years during which climbing mortgage finance costs contributed appreciably
to the rise in the over-all consumer price index. In the three years
ending December 1970, the CPI rose at an annual rate of 5.7 per cent,
but it would have risen at a rate of about 5.3 per cent had mortgage
costs been excluded.
The further decline in used car prices, and a slight drop in
house prices, more than offset an advance in the cost of household dur-
ables last month. Excluding used cars and houses, durable goods prices
continued to rise. The rise in prices of houses has been slowing since
last fall; this may reflect in part a failure to allow adequately for
the change in house quality as the mix of new homes shifted to less
expensive types.

The drop in home mortgage costs offset most of the substantial
advance in other service costs last month. Excluding home finance,
service prices rose at an annual rate of 8 per cent. Automobile insur-
ance premiums increased strongly for the second month, rents and gas
and electricity costs accelerated, and the rapid advance in medical
costs continued. Auto insurance rates, the fastest-rising price among
service groups in 1969-70, reached a level in February 34 per cent above
December 1968.

II -31
Farmers' production plans. March surveys indicate that
farmers are adjusting to the short feed supplies and excessive hog
production prevailing since late 1970 by planning to expand 1971
crops and to reduce hog output. The expansion in plantings is in
line with Department of Agriculture goals.
Farmers intend to plant 4 per cent more acreage this year
than last and 7 per cent more than 1969, which produced a record
output. If weather is normal and corn blight is no worse than last
year, a record crop is a possibility for 1971. Two-thirds of the
11 million net increase in plantings this year will be in corn and
grain sorghums with corn up 6 per cent and sorghums up 17 per cent.
Soybean acreage will be up 7 per cent reflecting in part prospects
for continued strong demand and high prices. Sharp increases in
spring wheat are primarily adjustments to program changes.
Departures from planting plans may be larger than usual
this year because of limited quantities of blight resistant seed
corn available. Corn producers in blight affected areas may decide
to plant less than their intended corn acreage rather than risk
planting susceptible seed. Actual plantings will be surveyed in
July and production estimates will be made monthly beginning in
August.
Livestock producers face prospects for continued unfavorable
livestock-feed price ratios until feed supplies become cheaper and
prices of livestock improve. Dairy price supports have been raised,
effective April 1, because of high feed costs. For hog producers,

II -32
the strain on profits is severe since low hog prices have prevailed
since last September. In fact, plentiful supplies of pork have
dampened all meat prices since last fall. Corn Belt hog producers
surveyed in March propose to cut back 1971 output for the seasonally
large fall market 7 per cent below a year earlier and to reduce
output for early 1972 markets by 15 per cent. In the meantime the
current large marketings are likely to continue until midyear. If
hog producers carry out these adjustments, hog prices are likely to
decline less than seasonally this fall and rise very substantially
in early 1972. Possibly these prospects for higher hog prices may
encourage cattle feeders and broiler producers to step up their
production plans and hog producers themselves to moderate their
intended cutbacks. USDA analysts expect cow and feed cattle
slaughter to expand this fall. Reportedly, large feedlot capacity,
dry weather, and easier credit availability are encouraging cattle
feeding in the Southwest, but this may be partially offset by
declines in the Corn Belt. Livestock producers decisions will be
strongly influenced by their evaluations of 1971-72 feed supply
prospects.

THE ECONOMIC PICTURE IN DETAIL
Domestic Financial Situation
Flow of funds, first quarter. The total flow of credit in
the first quarter was large by historical standards but not altogether
beyond precedent. Very preliminary estimates, based on partial data,
indicate a $113 billion annual rate for the quarter. At this rate,
total credit flows were about 11 per cent of GNP, which is close to the
upper end of this ratio on a quarterly basis in the postwar period. The
ratio has exceeded this level only in occasional quarters such as in the
1958-59 recovery and in the fourth quarter of 1967. The rate averaged
under 10 per cent for each of the years 1969 and 1970.

Credit market activity during the quarter was dominated by
long-term credit flows of all types, and these financings have contrib-
uted at least temporarily to the liquidity positions of borrowing
sectors. Municipal securities have been the outstanding case, with
State and local government borrowing, at a $23 billion annual rate, well
above the $19 billion rate of the fourth quarter and roughly twice as
high as any earlier high. Local governments are estimated to be in a
comfortable surplus position currently, suggesting that much of this
borrowing was in anticipation of outlays later this year. Whether or
not the spending appears, the rate of borrowing is likely to fall off.
For the present, the proceeds of these issues are adding substantially
to liquidity holdings of governments.
Corporate bond issues were also large in the first quarter,
although not above the fourth quarter and less emphatically above
earlier peaks than municipals.1/ As in 1970 these bond issues were
partly a substitute for bank credit and other short-term sources of
funds and to some extent are a funding of shorter-term liabili-
ties. The flotations are larger than current financing requirements,
however, and are associated with roughly a 10 per cent annual rate of
growth in corporate liquid asset holdings.
Mortgage flows recovered from their troughs of the first half
of 1970 and in the first quarter were running stronger than construction
activity would suggest. Land transactions and trading of existing

houses have probably been absorbing part of the funds, and for both
buyers and sellers these long-term financing flows are tending to
increase liquidity positions.
Taken together the net flow of credit in these private long-
term forms was about 8 per cent of GNP and over 70 per cent of total
funds raised. This pattern was similar to the fourth quarter of 1970,
but the two quarters taken together are without precedent as to the
volume of long-term capital market flows. In the total credit flow,
these large capital market activities are partly offset by lack of
growth in bank loans and commercial paper. Total credit flows have also
been held down by the restriction on Treasury borrowing imposed by the
debt ceiling through much of the quarter. Until the ceiling was raised,
the Treasury was forced to run off cash balances by sizable amounts for
current financing, but now seasonally adjusted net issues will need to
increase enough to restore a more normal cash position as well as to
cover current needs. Seasonally adjusted second-quarter borrowing--by
the Treasury and in total--is therefore likely to be well above the
first quarter even with some reduction in corporate and municipal flota-
tions.
On the supply side of credit markets, the shortage of new
Treasury and agency issues had an important influence in building up the
flow of household funds into institutional deposits in the first quarter.
As shown in the second table, Federal Reserve and foreign buying of
Treasury securities (lines 5 and 6) were substantially larger than the
net issue of such securities. Additional demands were generated by

III -4
commercial-bank purchases reflecting slack loan demand, the liquidity
buildup by savings and loan associations for second-quarter repayments
of their Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings, and liquidity investment of
proceeds of capital market financing by corporations and local govern-
ment. These sizable demands for Governments forced short-term interest
rates down to levels that broughttransfers of household funds out of
Government security holdings and accelerated time deposits inflows.
The institutions, with no immediately attractive uses for these extra
funds, added even further to their buying of Government securities. The
net result was a first-quarter liquidation by private nonfinancial
investors (line 9 of the second table), apparently at a $45 billion rate,
that eliminated most of the amounts bought in 1968 and 1969. After a
liquidation of this scale, this cycling of funds through institutions
to the government securities market is likely to be reduced in the
second quarter with a resulting decrease in the rate of deposit inflows.

was thus financed predominantly by time deposit inflows to banks. The
corporate bond market was given a similar assist from sharply increased
purchases by mutual savings banks (line 14). Purchases of private
bonds by individuals, while down from the unusual fourth quarter level,
were large compared to all other quarters.
The total structure of credit supply is summarized in the
third table, where the credit flow through institutions (line 6) in
the first quarter can be seen to be larger than total borrowing (line 1).
Heavy intermediation of this kind has occurred occasionally in the
past, such as the first half of 1958 and the second half of 1960,
although not on the scale indicated for the first quarter. In
coming months the degree of intermediation is likely to be reduced,
moving closer to the relationships of the second half of 1970, as
municipal and corporate security issues tend to decrease and Treasury
financing picks up, allowing for seasonal pattern.

Monetary Aggregates
The narrowly defined money supply, currency plus private
demand deposits, (M1), is now estimated to have increased in February
at an annual rate of 14 per cent, up sharply from the slow pace of
advance recorded in January and during the fourth quarter of last
year. Rates of growth in M2 (M1 plus commercial bank time and savings
deposits other than large CD's) and M3, (M2 plus time and savings deposits
at mutual savings banks and savings and loan associations) also picked
up markedly in February, each rising at annual rates of 22 per cent.
The February rate of growth in the adjusted bank credit proxy
was also above that for January and the fourth quarter. The acceleration
was moderated, however, by a marked slowing in the pace of CD sales and
by a slight reduction in U. S. Treasury deposits. Repayments of commercial
paper indebtedness and Euro-dollar liabilities also continued. The de-
cline in Euro-dollar liabilities was particularly sharp, reflecting
reduction in head office liabilities in order to finance foreign branch
takedowns of $1 billion in Export-Import Bank certificates.
Weekly average of daily figures, seasonally adjusted, for the
early part of March show continued advance in M1 although at a somewhat
slower pace than in February. The pace of growth in the daily average
for M2 over this period continued quite strong, as time and savings
deposits rose sharply further.
The growth in time and savings deposits appears to have
occurred at both large and small commercial banks, with significant
gains being recorded in most time deposit categories, as suggested by
the data in the table below. Many banks across the country have
reacted to this continued heavy inflow of time deposit funds by cutting

III -9
rates offered on passbook savings deposits and consumer time certificates
with short maturities. Banks in California, for example, will lower
their passbook savings deposit rates to 4 per cent from 4-1/2 per cent
on April 1. A further cut in offering rates on large CD's with
maturity dates of less than a year has also taken place since late
February, and the differential between these rates and rates on
competing money market instuments (such as Treasury bills) has
narrowed. Although banks have generally become much less willing
to bid for short-term deposit funds, some banks are now aggressively
seeking funds for deposits with longer maturities (5 years or over).
This is reflected in the recent hike in rates on such deposits insti-
tuted by some large banks in California and New York.

The pace of growth in the adjusted credit proxy during
the early part of March was again moderated by further reductions in
commercial paper indebtedness and more importantly by a further sharp
decline in Euro-dollar liabilities, the latter reflecting in part the
impact of an additional $500 million sale of Export-Import bank
certificates to foreign branches.

Bank Credit
Final estimates for February indicate that commercial bank
credit, adjusted for transfers of loans between banks and their
affiliates, increased at an annual rate of 13 per cent. This is slightly
below January's rate of increase but well above the pace set in the
fourth quarter of last year. Slightly more than half of the February
growth in total bank credit was accounted for by a further sharp
increase in security holdings. A pickup on the rate of acquisition

III -11
of U. S. Treasury issues compensated for a slowing in the rate of
increase of other securities--growth in these latter securities,
however, was still quite substantial by the standards of earlier years.
Total loans, adjusted for transfers, increased at a 9.4 per
cent annual rate in February, slightly above January's rate of
advance and in marked contrast to the decline recorded for the fourth
quarter of last year. A sizable increase in business loans was
mainly responsible, but real estate lending was also somewhat stronger
than in preceding months.
Weekly reporting bank data for the first half of March indicate
that commercial bank credit continued to increase rapidly over this
period--growth during the three weeks ending March 17 was more than
twice as large as the average of gains recorded in comparable periods
of other recent years. The pace of expansion in security holdings
appears to have been sustained, as holdings of U. S. Treasury issues
rose moderately, primarily reflecting the Treasury's sale of strip
bills early in the month, and holdings of other securities rose
sharply; both gains appear quite strong when compared with other
recent years, as shown in the table.

Total loans also appear to have risen substantially in early
March, even though business loan growth appears to have weakened
considerably and may even have turned negative. The weaker business
loan performance probably reflects the recent exceptionally heavy
capital market financing calendar; a considerable part of the new offering
volume has been for the stated purpose of funding short-term indebtedness.
Commercial bank liquidity has increased dramatically over this
past year, as banks have channelled a major portion of their heavy
deposit inflows into investments and liquid assets. The accompanying
chart shows the ratio of liquid assets to total liabilities at weekly
reporting banks. The ratio for the aggregate of weekly reporting banks,

III -13
which reached a low in late 1969, has been rising very sharply since
March of last year, and at present is significantly above previous
peak levels established in late 1967 and late 1968, There is,
however, some difference in the experience of New York weekly reporters
and other weekly reporters. While both groups have sharply increased
their liquidity from a year ago, the liquidity of New York banks
has not surpassed the peaks of 1967 and 1968.

Nonbank depositary intermediaries. Nonbank thrift institu-
tions continued to receive extraordinarily large deposit inflows during
the first half of March, according to sample data.1/ For the first two
months of the current quarter the deposit growth rate for nonbank thrift
institutions taken together was about double the already-increased
fourth quarter pace. There continue to be press and trade reports of
spreading cuts in deposit interest rates by thrift institutions, despite
the failure of Congress to renew interest rate ceiling legislation
(which fortunately came at a time when market yields on competing assets
were well below deposit offering rates). In any event, an interim
extension of ceilings has been sent to the President for his signature.

p/ Preliminary.
1/ The decline shown in the table for February at savings and loan
associations from the January deposit growth rate is not considered
significant, in large part because of seasonal adjustment problems.

III -16
Mutual savings banks have been able to convert most of their
increased deposit flows into long-term investments. They have acquired
a large volume of corporate securities--both debt and equity--in the
open market, partly because these assets are readily available and
partly because relative yields still favor such acquisitions over home
mortgages. Savings banks have not shown much emphasis on increasing
liquid assets, perhaps because long-term investment yields are attrac-
tive. Additionally, they may view the marketability of their corporate
securities as providing an element of liquidity.
By contrast, savings and loan associations, restricted in
their long-term investments principally to mortgages, have continued to
acquire a massive amount of liquid assets, almost entirely in the form
of Treasury bills, other Government issues, and Federal Agency issues
maturing within five years. The $3 billion increase in such assets
between November and February is far in excess of any cyclical liquid
asset rebuilding and is also far beyond the build-up needed in connec-
tion with the $1 billion increase in outstanding mortgage commitments
over that same time span. At the end of February, savings and loan
associations held over $9 billion in liquid assets in excess of FHLBB
requirements; even adjusting in advance for the forthcoming increase in
FHLBB requirements effective April 1, "free" liquid assets would be
very large. That part of the build-up reflects a lack of ready alterna-
tive uses for their large inflows is suggested by the continued large
volume of mortgages purchased in the secondary market.

III -17
But, in addition, a sizable amount of their expanded
liquidity undoubtedly will be used to repay Federal Home Loan Bank
advances now outstanding. During the first three weeks of March, $200
million of advances were repaid, in addition to the $700 million repaid
in January and February. April 15 is the first anniversary of the
FHLBB's program of subsidized-rate, fixed-term advances, one of the
conditions of which was a penalty for prepayment before one year.
During April a year ago, $3.3 billion of advances came under the pro-
gram, and subsequently another $5 billion of advances were arranged
with the same one-year prepayment penalty. The District Federal Home
Loan Banks are now operating autonomously to devise new subsidy schemes
in an effort to keep those advances outstanding. They are offering new
subsidized-rate terms not only to maturing advances but to all others
as well and are offering free conversion in some cases, waiving the
prepayment penalty. There are no aggregate data now available to indi-
cate the extent of conversions to new subsidized-rate fixed-term
advances, but on the basis of estimates made by the District Banks,
FHLB Board staff expects repayments of all outstanding advances to total
about $1 billion each in April and May and about $.5 billion in June.

3/ For the 1969-70 period, the FHLBB required that liquid assets equal
at least 5.5 per cent of savings capital. For the 1970-71 months
shown, the requirement was 5.5 per cent of the sum of savings capital
and borrowed funds. Effective April 1, 1971, that percentage will
be increased to 6.5 per cent, which will represent about $1.5 billion
transferred from "excess" to "required" liquidity.
Mortgage market. With deposit flows to thrift institutions
remaining unusually large, mortgage activity has picked up further,
according to field reports and trade opinion. In February, new and
outstanding mortgage commitments reached new seasonally adjusted highs
at savings and loan associations, and strengthened further at New York
State savings banks. Loan closings by both types of lenders were quite
high, although gross lending volume at the more diversified savings
banks has slackened somewhat since last fall as corporate securities
have remained attractive outlets for funds.

Association of New York State. Data for savings banks and S&L's
include a minor amount of nonresidential commitments. S&L commit-
ments include loans in process.
In response to the strong demand for mortgages by all types
of private lenders, FNMA sold $76 million from its own portfolio during
the first two months of 1971. FNMA sales of mortgages in February
actually exceeded FNMA purchases for the first time in more than six
years. Also, there was an acceleration in sales of mortgage-backed
pass-through participations issued against pools of Government-
underwritten mortgages and guaranteed by GNMA. More than $268 million
in such securities were issued in February, mainly by mortgage companies
selling to savings and loan associations. 1/
1/ Many S&L's are not set up to service Government-underwritten mort-
gages, and do not have an established correspondent relationship with
mortgage companies. The GNMA guarantee, in effect, assures the secur-
ities holder that the mortgage company will perform its services as
set forth in the guaranty contract.

III -20
The increased volume of funds available for mortgage invest-
ment has continued to exert downward pressure on mortgage interest
rates. In the most recent FNMA auction, the implicit secondary market
yield on 6-month forward purchase commitments for FHA and VA mortgages
remained at 7.45 per cent, more than 190 basis points below last year's
peak. In the primary market, the average interest rate on conventional
first mortgages for home purchase continued to drop in February.
Regionally, yields on such loans have declined most sharply in the West
and Southwest where, unlike other areas, usury ceilings had posed no
barrier to earlier upward rate movements. In addition to downward rate
adjustments, lenders during February further liberalized such nonrate
terms as loan maturity and loan-to-price ratio, according to the FHLBB
conventional home-mortgage survey.

In contrast to otherwise improving mortgage market conditions,
there were additional reports of some further deterioration in the
quality of outstanding mortgage credit late last year, judging from such
after-the-fact measures as delinquency and foreclosure rates. According
to the sensitive Mortgage Bankers Association series, delinquency rates
in the fourth quarter of 1970 reached a new high and, while still rela-
tively low, the proportion of mortgages in foreclosure was at the
highest fourth-quarter rate since 1966. Regionally, those areas of the
nation hardest hit by layoffs in the aerospace industry and by the auto
strike reported the largest proportional increase in delinquencies. In
addition to localized unemployment problems, the recent increase in
various housing programs for lower-income families may have contributed
to the rising delinquency and foreclosure rates.

Corporate and municipal securities markets. Since the last
Committee meeting, yields on new high-grade corporate bonds have dropped
almost 70 basis points. With few concrete signs of a near-term upsurge

III -22
in the economy and with the latest cut in the prime rate giving
additional evidence of the increased availability of bank credit,
investor expectations about an upturn in long-term interest rates were
revised as the month progressed. Thus, the market was able to absorb
a record $4.1 billion of new public corporate bond offerings at declin-
ing yields. The tax-exempt market, which also saw a new offerings
record set in the first quarter of 1971, improved further in March,
with municipal yields at midmonth reaching the lowest level in over
2 years.

As corporate yields fell during March, previously postponed
issues came to market and one or two large issues originally scheduled
for April were accelerated, resulting in an unprecedented four-week

III -23
period in which public bond offerings exceeded $900 million each week.
Sale of this volume was facilitated by the fact that much of it was in
the form of large, high-quality, negotiated offerings. About half of
the enlarged offerings for the month were accounted for by manufacturing
corporations, which normally represent about one-third of the total.
Banks and bank holding companies--which have seldom financed in long-
term markets--accounted for almost one-tenth of the new issues. Bond
sales by utilities and communications companies, while high in absolute
terms, represented only a little more than one-fifth of offerings;
these firms usually account for one-half of the total. And with the
steady improvement in stock prices over the month, sales of convertible
bonds increased appreciably, amounting to over $500 million.

Public bond schedules of April and May are light relative to
the March peak, but will average close to the first quarter pace of
$2.8 billion per month. Recent announcements have consisted mainly of
issues of $100 million or less. The April and May calendars of new
stock offerings continue to build, as the large public utility volume
has recently been expanded by stock issues of smaller and medium sized
industrial corporations taking advantage of higher stock prices. There
are also some indications that takedowns of private placements may be
growing in line with increased fund availability at life insurance
companies. The latest SEC figures show a relatively high volume of
takedowns for January, following close on the usual December peak, and
some underwriters report increased private placement activity this
year. Altogether, the staff expects total corporate security offerings
for April and May to remain above the first-quarter average, in spite
of the prospective slowing of the pace of public bond offerings.
Yields on tax-exempt securities declined about 35 basis
points in March, even though sales of long-term debt by State and local
governments remained at historically high levels. Commercial banks have
continued to be a major factor in the tax-exempt market, lengthening the
maturity of their purchases in some cases, and fire and casualty com-
panies remained active in the long-term end of the market. The forward
calendar is building somewhat more slowly than the staff anticipated
earlier, even though the Board's fourth quarter survey of bond anticipa-
tions 1/ suggests that offerings by State and local units for the second

quarter will be high. It is possible that local government officials
are temporarily withholding announcements in the expectation of further
interest rate declines and perhaps temporarily relying on short-term
borrowing to take advantage of the wide spread between long and short
rates.

Net sales of short-term tax-exempt securities in the first
quarter remained close to the record pace of late 1970. Issues of
short-term debt are geographically concentrated, with much of the
recent activity in this area attributable to New York, which has special
financial problems. However, some banks report that there has recently
been an increase in the volume of direct short-term bank loans to local
government units. Since these loans would not be reflected in the
securities data, the series on net short-term financing probably under-
states the volume of such financing by State and local governments.

Government securities market. Yields on Treasury notes and
bonds have generally declined an additional 10-50 basis points since
the last meeting of the Committee. Rates on Treasury bills, however,
have risen on balance. The yield declines on coupon issues brought the
yield on 10-year Governments to around 5.50 per cent, the lowest level for
this rate since late 1967; and the spread of corporate bond yields over
the Treasury rate has continued to be very wide by historical standards.
Shorter maturities showed smaller declines in Treasury coupon issue
yields; and the 1-year coupon rate has increased slightly on balance
in line with the net rise in bill rates.

The downward movement in intermediate and longer Treasury
yields has reflected in part the rally in the corporate market and the
drift in expectations underlying that rally. There has also been a
continuing favorable reaction to System purchases of coupon issues,
which have totaled about $400 million since the last meeting compared
with nearly $620 million in the preceding four weeks. These develop-
ments have been accompanied by a very heavy volume of trading activity
in Treasury coupon issues in March, a month in which there is no Treasury
coupon financing. The daily average trading volume for March has been
about $1.1 billion, compared to $575 million in March of last year.
Despite the Desk's purchases of coupon issues, dealers' positions in
issues due in over a year have risen slightly since the Committee's
last meeting.

Bill rates continued under downward pressure immediately
following the Committee meeting as demands remained heavy, particularly
from foreign official accounts who had to invest dollar accumulations
directly in market instruments as debt ceiling restrictions precluded
Treasury issuance of special securities to them. On passage of the
increase in the statutory debt ceiling, the Treasury announced a $5
billion financing operation, entirely in the bill sector. This con-
sisted of $2 billion of additional April tax bills, auctioned of
March 24 for payment on the 30th; a $2.2 billion bill "strip" of bills
in the 4-5 month area; and $200 million additions to four weekly 6-
month bill auctions. In response to this announced increase in bill
supplies, short-term bill rates jumped sharply, with the 3-month issue
rising 18 basis points to just over 3.50 per cent. Subsequently, bill
rates moved briefly back down toward their earlier levels; but with the
recent increase in supply and the tauter tone in the money market,
rates pushed higher again and are now 5-30 basis points over their
levels at the time of the March 9 meeting.
New issue activity in the Federal agency market has been
relatively light, but the trend toward somewhat longer maturities con-
tinues, with FNMA including a $200 million 13-year maturity in their
latest offering and with the Farmers Home Administration selling a $200
million in net new funds as a $450 million reduction in outstanding
debt by the FHLB offset a large portion of the new money borrowing by
other agencies. As the increase in new agency borrowing has moderated
and as interest rates in the Treasury market have moved lower as well,

III -29
yields on outstanding agency issues have declined by as much cr more than
on comparable Treasury maturities. In consequence, spreads of agency
issues over direct Treasury issues are generally narrower than earlier
in the year and about the same, or a little narrower, than in early 1967.
Other short-term credit markets. As of the end of February,
seasonally adjusted commercial and finance company paper outstanding
totaled $32.6 billion, off $409 million over the month and $1,061
million since year-end.
Finance company paper accounted for most of the decline,
reflecting the weakness in the recovery to date in consumer credit
and also probably increased competition from commercial banks in the
auto loan area. In addition, several of the large finance companies
have issued intermediate-term notes and debentures within the past
two months, thus allowing a cutback of short-term liabilities.
Dun and Bradstreet's removal of Chrysler Corporation's
prime rating has had little effect of the market. Purchasers have
been scrutinizing Chrysler paper carefully since last summer, and
Chrysler's financial difficulties had already been widely reviewed
in the press. Although Chrysler Finance was unable to roll over most
of its maturing paper last week, and expects substantial runoffs to
continue, it does have large unused bank credit lines. The parent
corporation has no commercial paper outstanding.
Dealer-placed paper changed little in February remaining at
$13.8 billion, following substantial gains in the August 1970-January 1971
period. Outstanding dealer paper grew $2.8 billion from August through
February and is still an attractive alternative to short-term bank

III -30
loans for many firms. A large rate differential still persists:
30-270 day commercial paper is quoted at 3-7/8--4-5/8 per cent as
compared with a 5-1/4 per cent prime rate. Dealers report an average
lengthening of maturities into the six-month range, in anticipation of
an upward movement in short-term rates.
Bank-related paper outstanding fell $129 million to $1.9
billion in February. The runoff since mid-August, when the announce-
ment was made that reserve requirements were to be applied to such
paper, now totals $5.8 billion.
Most short-term interest rates, after moving downward
early in the month, have returned to about the levels of five weeks
ago. The only significant further declines have been in certificates
of deposit maturing in one and three months, which fell 63 and 50
basis points respectively. New issue CD's maturing in 30-59 days
are currently being quoted somewhat below Treasury bills for comparable
maturity.

Federal finance. The recent Congressional action on social
security has made the budget posture somewhat more expansive than
indicated in the January budget document. Compared to previous Board
Staff projections, however, the high employment budget in calendar 1971
remains about unchanged, although total receipts and expenditure are
both somewhat lower and adjustments have been made in the quarterly
pattern.
The 10 per cent social security benefit hike (beginning in
June retroactive to January) will add little more to Federal outlays than
the Administration's earlier estimate since the 6 per cent increase
proposed by the Administration included additional social securityJanuary

reforms not incorporated into the 10 per cent hike. The Congressional
decision to postpone the increase in the social security tax wage
base until 1972, however, reduces projected receipts by about $2.5
billion in calendar 1971. The effect of the social security
legislation on Staff estimates was to reduce projected expenditures,
since the Staff had already estimated a 10 per cent hike as well as substantial
additional benefit reforms 'that were previously approved by the Senate
but not enacted. This cut in expected outlays is about offset on the
receipts side, however, because the Staff had not assumed the post-
ponement of the wage base increase.
Judging from data recently becoming available, Federal
spending in the first quarter, on a NIA basis, was below the last
Greenbook estimate by $2.5 billion (annual rates) due chiefly to
a shortfall.in transfers and grants. For the second half of
calendar 1971, however, our estimates of expenditures now allow for
the large increase in military pay recently approved by the House
Armed Services Committee. Since this action is designed to encourage
voluntary enlistments, it appears to have a good chance for enactment.
Staff estimates, on the other hand, do not include the major reforms
in welfare and in health currently under discussion. Should either
of these measures pass, expenditures in the second half of the year
could be larger than we have estimated. But the probable failure
of Congress to pass the general revenue sharing program proposed by
the Administration, and included in Staff estimates, would provide
some offset to Congressional action in these areas. The proposed special

III -34
revenue sharing programs, which may have a better opportunity for
Congressional approval than general revenue sharing, will not affect
outlays in calendar 1971.
In terms of NIA concepts, the changes in Staff estimates
result in a $.6 billion increase in the projected deficit to a level
of $18.7 billion in this calendar year--partly reflecting weakness in
corporate tax receipts as noted further below. This compares with a
$11.1 billion deficit in calendar 1970. On a high employment basis,
however, the Staff estimates continue to show a small surplus, of
$.7 billion for 1971, thereby indicating little change in discre-
tionary fiscal policy from the prior year when there was a small
high employment deficit of $.8 billion.
On a cash basis, Staff estimates of receipts and expenditures
for fiscal 1971 have been revised downward. Actual receipts in
February were nearly $1.0 billion less than previously estimated
by the Staff and although considerable uncertainty remains in these
estimates, preliminary data for March suggest that receipts continue
to be weaker than estimated earlier. As a result the Treasury's
cash balance is expected to remain at low levels until the seasonal
increase in receipts in the second half of April--despite the recent
new bill financing. The cash balance situation is further clouded by
recent activity in special Treasury issues on the part of foreign and
agency investors. It is not clear to what extent net investments will
continue. If further temporary financing should be required prior to
mid-April, the Treasury may resort to special borrowing from the Federal
Reserve. During May, the Treasury needs to refund $5.8 billion of
publicly held maturing issues, and is also expected to raise a sizeable
amount of new cash.

THE ECONOMIC PICTURE IN DETAIL
International Developments
U.S. balance of payments. The worsening of the balance of
payments that was evident in January and February was not reversed in
March, and the deficit may even have deepened. On the liquidity
basis the January-February deficit was $1-1/2 billion, and for March,
through the 24th, a deficit of at least $1 billion was registered.
Even if the last week in March turns out to be relatively favorable,
the first quarter deficit, seasonally adjusted, may be of the magnitude
of $2-1/2 billion -- exceeding by far the heavy deficits of the first
half of 1970.
Since liabilities to private foreigners were reduced sharply
in February and again in March (largely repayments of Euro-dollar
borrowings via foreign branches), the deficit as measured by the balance
on official settlements has been substantially larger. For January-
February this deficit totaled $2.7 billion, and for March it probably
exceeded $2 billion. For the quarter, therefore, this balance on a
seasonally adjusted basis may exceed $5 billion -- again far larger than
in any previous quarter.
Deficits of this size reflect serious weaknesses in both the
current and capital accounts. In the current account, the data for
merchandise trade show a further dwindling of the surplus in January-

IV -2
February to about a $1/2 billion annual rate. Demand conditions
projected for the U.S. and other countries suggest that the trade
balance could decline further as the year progresses. It may be that
other elements in the current account are also yielding lower receipts;
in particular, net income on investments may be suffering if foreign
profits are under pressure.
As to the capital accounts, it is clear that net outflows
have risen sharply -- even apart from the repayments of Euro-dollar
borrowings. Such enlarged outflows are not evidentin the January-
February data for bank-reported claims or transactions in foreign
securities. The reports by banks show a very sizable return flow of
funds in January -- largely from Japan and Canada -- and only a modest
outflow in February. Purchases of foreign bonds -- apart from an issue
of the International Bank, the proceeds of which were invested in
non-liquid U.S. assets -- were small in January and, according to
partial reports, were negligible in February. However, there was a
turn, though still relatively small, toward purchases of foreign
(especially Japanese) equity securities in February.
According to early reports, the inflow of foreign funds
into U.S. corporate stocks, which had provided strong support to the
accounts since last June, nearly disappeared in February. It is
difficult to judge the significance or permanence of this shift. The
market here was generally strong, except for a brief dip during the

IV -3
month, but equity markets in Germany, Japan and Switzerland were also
making strong showings, after being relatively weak in the last half
of 1970. If these inflows were to shrink significantly the effect
on the over-all balance would be very substantial.
Information on corporate capital flows for the early months
of the year is not yet avilable, but seems likely that they have
rebounded to the veryhigh levels of early 1970. For the year 1970,
the net outflow of corporate funds was $1.9 billion, about $500 million
more than in 1969. Over half of the net outflow occurred in the first
quarter of the year. The recently issued projections of foreign plant
and equipment expenditures show a 16 per cent rise for this year, after
a 22 per cent increase in 1970. In both years the greatest increase
is directed toward investments in Europe. Moveover, these figures do
not include acquisitions of existing foreign enterprises. Under conditions
of relatively easing costs of funds in the U.S., it can be expected that
companies will maximize their use of U.S.-source financing within the
limits allowed by the restrictions.
The size of the liquidity deficit suggests that outflows of
short-term interest-sensitive funds not covered by the restrictions
may also be increasing. Such outflows may show up as a renewed rise
in negative errors and omissions.
U.S. foreign trade. In February, the U.S. trade balance
(on a balance of payments basis) was a small surplus compared with a
small deficit in January, as imports fell by 4 per cent and exports

IV -4
remained close to the high January level. For January -February
combined, however, the export surplus was $1/2 billion at an annual
rate, dropping further from the already low rate of about $3/4 billion
in the fourth quarter of 1970. Surpluses of $3.0 billion had been
recorded in both the second and third quarters of 1970. The main
factor reducing the surplus was rising imports, as shown below:
PER CENT CHANGES IN VALUES FROM PRECEDING PERIODS
19 7 0 1 9 7 1
1Q 2Q 3Q 4Q Jan.-Feb.
U.S. Exports +3.5 +3.2 +1.2 -1.9 +4.3
U.S. Imports +3.4 +1.3 +1.5 +3.2 +5.0
Higher prices, judging by January unit-values, may have accounted for
about one-fifth of the import rise in January-February from the fourth
quarter. By commodities, the import rise in January-February was
much more broadly distributed than the increase in the fourth quarter
of 1970.
Some of the import increase so far this year can be considered
temporary. Higher coffee arrivals result from an inventory adjustment
and the greater inflow of Canadian cars reflects a recovery from the
GM strike. Imports have also been boosted by hedge-buying of foreign
steel, which is likely to continue strong in the coming months. In
addition, purchases of lumber and aluminum from abroad are also high
and will be strong as a result of the upturn in domestic construction
activity.

IV -5
A very heavy inflow of virtually all types of consumer
goods in January-February persists in spite of sluggishness in domestic
consumer expenditures and rising prices of imports. Also contributing
to the current higher level of imports is the slowdown in foreign
economic activity making available greater quantities of foreign
commodities for shipment to the United States than previously. While
steel is a prime example of this, it may also be applicable to some
types of consumer goods.
The drop in fuels following a sharp rise in the fourth quarter
was unexpected but the future price of petroleum imports will rise as
a result of the new tax agreements with the governments of foreign oil-
producing countries.
Exports in January-February were at an annual rate of
$43.8 billion, (balance of payments basis), 4 per cent higher
than in the fourth quarter and virtually equal to the peak rates of
mid-1970. Export prices (January unit-values) appear to be up even
more sharply than for imports and may have accounted for as much as
one-third of the rise in the value of exports over the fourth quarter
rate. The rise in exports in January-February consisted almost
entirely of increased shipments of automobile parts following the
resumption of GM production, greater deliveries of commercial aircraft
and continued strength in shipments of agricultural products. Company
schedules call for further expansion in sales of aircraft in the next

IV -6
few months, but the boost to cotal exports given by the upturn
in shipments of automobile parts to Canada as a result of the GM
strike will not continue much longer.
Euro-dollar market. Euro-dollar interest rates firmed
in the shorter maturities in the last week of March, in large
part probably reflecting normal quarter-end positioning -- reportedly
including repatriations by American companies for end-March reporting
under OFDI guidelines. For the month as a whole call Euro-dollar
deposits averaged about 1/8 per cent below their February level and
the average excess of the call Euro-dollar rate over the Federal
funds rate narrowed by about the same amount. Although one- and
three-month Euro-dollar rates averaged roughly 3/8 per cent below
the previous month, the average excess of these rates over domestic
CD's of comparable maturity widened to nearly 1.4 per

Gross liabilities of U.S. banks to their foreign branches
(including domestic loan participations) declined about $650 million
in the week from February 24 to March 3 -- when foreign branches
made payment for the second Ex-Im security issue which totaled $500
million. These borrowings declined further, by about $700 million,
in the next three weeks. On March 24 these liabilities were $4.5
billion, and foreign branch holdings of Ex-Im securities were $1.5
billion; this $6 billion total compares with liabilities to branches
of about $8 billion in mid-January.
In the Euro-dollar reserve requirement computation period
ended March 17, U.S. banks' average Euro-dollar borrowings plus
average foreign branch holdings of Ex-Im notes declined by a little
over $900 million -- the largest decline in any computation period
so far in 1971 and in all of 1970. (In the computation period ended
February 17 the average declined by less than $300 million.) Through
March 29 in the computation period that will end April 14 the banks'
daily average liabilities to branches are estimated to have declined
further, by about $0.7 billion.
Foreign exchange markets. Exchange market activity in
March was again characterized by large flows of interest-sensitive
funds into major European currencies. Central banks of the EEC
countries and the U.K. absorbed some $2.6 billion from the market
in net spot market intervention bringing their reserve gains for the

IV -8
first quarter to around $5-1/2 billion. (About $400 million pur-
chased in March was for value in April.) In addition, these banks
purchased dollars for future delivery in the amount of $600 million.
Germany and the U.K. were the largest reserve gainers
during the month with net spot dollar purchases of $1.5 billion
and $600 million, respectively, as interest rates in both countries
remained well above Euro-dollar rates. Nearly $1 billion of the
inflow into Germany occurred in the first half of the month as
domestic financial markets tightened ahead of the mid-month tax
date. Contributing to the strength of the spot DM during this
period was the discontinuance, on March 9, of the Bundesbank's
sales of forward marks which had served to some extent to reduce
the demand for spot marks. Following some abatement after mid-month,
demand for marks again surged at month-end when the Bundesbank
purchased $300 million despite a one per cent reduction in its
discount and Lombard rates to 5 and 6-1/2 per cent, respectively.
Interest rate considerations as well as good commercial
demand also led to a strengthening of the French franc, and the Bank
of France purchased about $300 million. On the other hand, an easing
of domestic money markets in the Netherlands and Belgium led to an
easing of the guilder and the Belgian franc on the exchange markets
and to a reduced rate of reserve gain by those two countries. The
Italian lira firmed during the month, possibly reflecting an improve-
ment in Italy's trade balance. The Bank of Italy purchased around
$150 million.

IV -9
The Swiss franc advanced steadily throughout the month. The
Swiss National Bank purchased a small amount of dollars spot and $500
million on a swap basis. In contrast to the usual pattern, the spot
rate did not ease after this infusion of domestic liquidity, and at
month-end was holding firmly at the ceiling. The three-month forward
rate moved well above the spot ceiling rate, indicating some uncertainty
in the market over the stability of the franc's upper limit.
In addition to the massive reserve gains by European countries,
press reports indicate that the Bank of Japan may have purchased on
the order of $700 million for the month.
In official transactions in March, the System repaid its
remaining swap debt ($75 million) to the Netherlands Bank, using
System DM balances. It also repaid $450 million to the Swiss National
Bank, through a combination of the sale by the Treasury of $75 million
in gold, the issuance of a $250 million equivalent Swiss-franc
denominated certificate of indebtedness, and a $125 million increase
in the Swiss National Bank's uncovered dollar position. System drawings
on the National Bank of Belgium were increased by $35 million to a
total of $420 million. In connection with the advance repayment by
the British of $685 million equivalent in various currencies to the
IMF on March 31, the System initiated a swap drawing of $130 million
on the Netherlands Bank, and the Treasury sold $25 million equivalent
of SDRs to the National Bank of Belgium. Those two banks had sold
their domestic currencies to the Bank of England for dollars to enable
it to make its Fund repayment.

IV -10
Trade developments in major industrial countries. During the
second half of 1970, imports of the major industrial countries continued
to increase -- although at a slower rate than earlier last year. The
trend of imports was, however, obscured by the British dock strike at
mid-year, the General Motors strike in the United States and in Canada
later in the year, and -- most recently -- by the British postal strike.
Data for the first two months of 1971 suggest that the deceleration
continues.

Through at least November both intra-European imports and
European imports from Canada, Japan and the United States were rising,
because investment demand and consumer demand for finished goods
remained quite buoyant, despite a general reduction in excess demand
and flattening production in some industrial countries, notably Germany.
Imports have, however, levelled since the end of 1970 in France, Italy,
Germany, and Japan, although year-end and January data indicate a
renewed rise in industrial production in France, Germany, and Japan
and an increase in domestic industrial orders in Germany.
Reduced domestic demand pressures in Canada, and to a slight
extent in Japan, were responsible for a slower growth in import demand
in both countries in 1970. The slight recession in Canada resulted in
virtually no import growth, and an actual decline in the second half of
1970, even excluding automotive imports from the United States, which
are largely geared to Canadian automotive exports. By contrast, Japan's
imports rose rather steadily throughout most of 1970, before declining
slightly in the fourth quarter, and levelling out in January.
Imports of OECD countries from the rest of the world rose
slightly faster in the second half than in the first half of 1970.
However, for 1970 as a whole, their imports rose at a much slower rate
than in 1969. Several major industrial countries reduced their imports
from the rest of the world after mid-1970. These reductions may in
part be attributed to downward inventory adjustments of raw materials
and semi-finished products in those countries. In addition, reduced

IV -12
primary commodity prices, especially for copper, contributed to the
deceleration in imports in value terms from the rest of the world.
Imports
Germany's import growth in the second half of 1970 -- after
slowing in the third quarter and picking up in the fourth quarter --
was particularly strong in finished goods. The share of raw materials
and semi-finished products in total imports has declined since early
1970, in part owing to lower primary product prices, especially for
copper and natural rubber, and -- perhaps more importantly -- because
of inventory adjustments, especially in the steel and chemical industries,
where production stagnated. Domestic industrial orders have been rising
since November, and industrial production increased in January. German
imports rose again in February after a decline in January.
Excess demand and capacity constraints in a booming economy
drove up Dutch imports in 1970. The sharp rise of crude oil, petroleum,
and machinery imports -- particularly in the fourth quarter -- reflects
in part the high import content of the major Dutch export industries.
Both Germany and Belgium increased their share of Dutch imports. Pur-
chases of jumbo jets from the United States are expected to push up Dutch
imports substantially this year.
The brisk rise in British imports in the second half of 1970 --
despite domestic economic slack -- was concentraced on finished
manufactures mostly from Europe, while imports of most industrial
materials, excepting fuels, grew very slowly. Imports levelled out

IV -13
in the last quarter, declined in January, but rose again in February,
although the postal strike distorted the reported figures for the
first two months of 1971.
During the second and third quarters of last year, French
imports of capital goods, especially from the United States, increased
sharply, reflecting capacity limitations in that sector of the French
economy. Imports from OECD Europe, and particularly from third countries,
fell sharply during the same period. Imports were flat in the fourth
quarter, dipped in January, but in February returned to their year-end
level.
The increase in Italian imports after mid-year 1970 was
concentrated on investment and finished consumer goods, coming mostly
from Europe. After a sharp rise in the third quarter, the rate of
increase flattened in the fourth quarter, and imports declined in
January and February, as demand in Italy weakened slightly.
Exports
Canada's surge in exports continued in the second half of
1970, even with the rise in the exchange rate, partly because most
prices of Canada's major exports are contracted for in U.S. dollars.
But Canadian exports were also greatly helped -- especially during the
first half of 1970 -- by booming economic conditions in Europe and Japan,
as well as by large grain shipments to the Soviet Union around mid-year.
Valued in U.S. dollars, Canada's exports to the United States -- excluding
U.S.-Canadian automotive trade -- rose about 10 per cent in 1970.

IV -14
German exports expanded less rapidly in the second half of
1970. The inflow of foreign industrial orders remained level during
this period, as economic activity and demand for capital goods slackened
in several industrial countries. Order levels may also have been affected
by large price increases, especially for investment goods, reflecting the
revaluation, as well as inflation in Germany. The sharp rise in exports
at year's end and the favorable rate of export growth in January and
February probably reflect more a running down of large export backlogs
than a rise in foreign orders.
In the second half of 1970, both the United Kingdom and Japan
enlarged their export markets in Europe, and shipped predominantly
machinery and finished goods. But most of the increase in total British
exports was in value rather than in volume, and real exports rose only
slightly in the second half of 1970, and declined in January and February.
Japan's exports rose briskly once again after a relatively flat third
quarter. Shipments of motor vehicles, steel products, and other finished
manufactures to the EEC, EFTA, and the United States recorded the sharpest
gains.
Trade balances
Although from 1969 to 1970 imports of a number of industrial
countries expanded faster than their exports, particularly in the second
half of 1970, improvements in the trade balances of Canada, the United
States, Japan, France, Germany, and Belgium more than outweighed the
aggregate decreases for the other industrial countries in 1970.

IV -15
The balance of trade for the EEC moved from a small surplus
in 1969 to a small deficit in 1970. The large trade deficits of the
Netherlands and Italy with non-OECD countries and with Canada and the
United States exceeded the improved overall surplus positions of Germany
and Belgium. The trade deficit of the EFTA countries, excluding the
United Kingdom, increased substantially in 1970 over 1969. The United
Kingdom, however, improved its trade position for the second consecutive
year, and ran a small surplus in 1970, despite a year-end surge in imports.
The German trade surplus widened in the second half of 1970.
It was even higher than in the comparable period of 1969 and almost as

high as in the second half of 1968, despite substantially higher German
export prices in U.S. dollar terms, reflecting the 1969 revaluation as
well as domestic price increases. The Italian and Dutch trade deficits
increased significantly in the second half of 1970. Similarly, the
deficits of the major EFTA countries deteriorated more sharply during
the latter part of 1970. In Austria and Switzerland, where excess
demand generated steeply rising imports, especially from Germany,
trade deficits increased, particularly in the fourth quarter. The
trade positions of the Scandinavian countries were also affected
adversely by domestic demand and price pressures, and their deficits
worsened substantially in the fourth quarter, with the exception of
Sweden where stabilization policies and a softening of demand improved
the trade balance during the second half of 1970.
Prospects for continued growth in trade of the industrial
countries in 1971 will be largely conditioned by the extent of the
expected deceleration in economic growth and the relative price
performance, notably in continental Europe and Japan, as well as by
a resumption of economic growth in the United States and more buoyant
economic activity in Canada and the United Kingdom. The OECD Secretariat
expects an annual rate of advance in OECD exports and imports in value
terms of about 10 per cent from 1970 to 1971, compared with about
15 per cent from 1969 to 1970. Should economic activity level off
more rapidly than current indicators suggest -- especially in Germany --
reduced domestic demand pressures may release resources for renewed

may reduce their import demand during the remainder of 1971.
