SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK
Nonfinancial
GNP in the first quarter increased $28.5 billion in current
dollars, according to preliminary Commerce estimates. Real growth was
at an annual rate of 6.5 per cent, with the GNP deflator estimated to
have risen at an annual rate of 5.2 per cent.
We continue to expect less rapid expansion in the current
quarter in both current dollar and real GNP, now that the post-strike
recovery in auto sales has ended. Industrial production is tentatively
estimated to have increased slightly further in April, with some rise
likely in consumer staples, consumer durable goods other than autos,
and in steel and some other materials. Auto assemblies in April are
estimated to have declined to an annual rate of 8.2 million units from
9 million in March. Assemblies for May and June are scheduled at
about the April rate.
Retail sales, which increased appreciably in March, are
estimated on the basis of weekly data to have maintained their upward
momentum in April. Sales of nondurable goods have been strong in the
past two months following a lackluster performance early in the year.
Sales of domestic autos in the first 20 days of April were at an 8.1
million annual rate, about the same as in the first quarter. Housing
activity continued to rise at a rapid pace and starts increased sharply
in March.
New orders for durable goods declined in March, mainly in
the volatile defense orders group. Orders for capital equipment were
off slightly, but have been essentially level since last November.

I-2
Book value of business inventories rose quite moderately in February,
as in January, with increases in autos and steel more than offsetting
declines in other sectors.
In the labor market, insured unemployment in early April
remained at the February-March level, while initial claims edged down.
Output per mannour in the private economy rose sharply in the first
quarter, following no growth over the fourth quarter. Over the past
year the gain in productivity, at 3.3 per cent, was substantially
better than in the preceding two years. Compensation continued to
increase sharply, however, and the increase in unit labor costs--both
in the first quarter and over the year--remained relatively large.
The rise in consumer prices, seasonally adjusted, in March
and over the first quarter as a whole was much smaller than for some
time. Much of the recent improvement has resulted from the sharp
decline in mortgage interest rates, which is not reflected in the
deflator.
Outlook. The staff projects an increase of $19 billion in
current dollar GNP for the second quarter and a rise in real GNP at an
annual rate of about 3 per cent. Both figures are somewhat larger
than in the preceding Greenbook; we have raised consumer spending
because of the strength indicated in March-April retail sales, and
residential construction activity mainly because of the March upsurge
in starts.
Our projections for the second half of the year are virtually
unchanged from those of four weeks ago. The assumption of a steel

I -3
strike of about two months duration makes for an uneven quarterly
pattern, but for both quarters combined, growth in real GNP is projected
at an annual rate of about 4-1/4 per cent. The latest McGraw-Hill
survey indicates a rise of 4 per cent in business capital outlays for
1971, the same as the recent Commerce-SEC survey, and we have therefore
not modified our earlier projection.
Resumption of growth in the labor force and continued gains
in productivity are expected to result in an increase in the unemploy-
ment rate during the second quarter. These factors also seem likely
to make for relatively little change in the unemployment rate in the
second half of the year, even with the projected real output increase.
The rise in the implicit GNP deflator is now projected to slow somewhat
less than formerly--to an annual rate of 3.8 per cent in the fourth
quarter.
The recent pattern of wage and price developments suggests
somewhat less moderation in underlying price pressures than we had been
expecting. The rise in the GNP deflator is now projected to moderate
to 3.8 per cent, annual rate, in the fourth quarter.
Financial
Interest rates in both short- and long-term markets generally
rose upwards of 50 basis points in April, despite a continued rapid
increase in the monetary aggregates and some moderation of credit
demands. The increase in market interest rates reflected--in the main--
a shift of investor expectations that was based, in part, on tauter money
market conditions. An advance in the Federal funds rate was widely

I-4
interpreted as a shift in monetary policy initiated both for balance-
of-payments reasons and in order to reduce the rate of growth of the
monetary aggregates. In addition, rates in long-term markets came
under temporary upward pressure when it was thought that the Treasury,
as a part of its May refinancing, might take advantage of the new
statutory leeway to offer a long-term bond outside the 4-1/4 per cent
interest rate ceiling.
Credit demands both in the open market and at banks have
moderated somewhat in recent weeks, Net corporate demands in the
commercial paper market appear to have remained small in the first half
of April after sizeable net repayments in March. And corporate bond
offerings, following the record March volume, were less in April than
the staff had expected, reflecting in large part postponements of
scheduled issues. Although real estate loans at banks probably con-
tinued to advance at the recent higher pace, bank business loans are
expected to show only modest growth at best in April. Loan repayments
from March security financings apparently continued to be large early
in the month, and business loan demands at banks over the tax date
were quite weak. Even with these weak loan demands, the increase in
short-term rates encouraged an increase of one-fourth of a percentage
point in the prime loan rate on April 22; most of the large banks have
adopted this higher rate, but several key institutions have remained
at 5-1/4 per cent.

I -5
Outlook. Assuming no further change in money market conditions,
market interest rates may well stabilize, on balance, around current
levels in the weeks ahead. The Federal sector, including agencies,
will be a net repayer of debt in May and June. Although direct Treas-
ury obligations are expected to decline by a less than seasonal $500 mil-
lion, the housing agencies are expected to retire $1.5 to $2.0 billion
of their maturing obligations. In addition, the corporate public bond
calendar, while still large by historical standards, has not mounted
as it often has in previous periods of market apprehension about the
possibility of future interest rate increases. Bond offerings of
State and local governments, however, are expected to continue at al-
most the record first quarter pace. While banks are likely to be in
a position to continue to acquire a sizeable volume of tax-exempt ob-
ligations, they will be constrained by some expected reduction in net
inflows of time deposits and by a possible moderate expansion in busi-
ness loan demands. Thus, the municipal bond market may continue to be
vulnerable to upward rate pressures during the current quarter.
The recent higher level of market yields--and the likeli-
hood that earlier heavy swapping by the public from market instruments
to deposit accounts has now largely run its course--should tend to de-
celerate deposit inflows to thrift institutions. Such a development
has already occurred for bank consumer-type time deposits, on which
offering rates have been generally lowered. In view of the recently
changed financial environment, non-bank thrift institutions may remain
cautious about following along

I -6
with these deposit rate declines. And with aggregate credit demands to
finance new construction being heavily supplemented by demands for used-
home transfers and loan refinancing in the spring period of strong sea-
sonal credit requirements, declines in interest rates on home mortgages
are expected to slow.
International developments and the balance of payments
The heavy speculative movements from the dollar into the
German mark and other European currencies that had built up to a peak in
the first few days of April subsided for three weeks, but a recrudescence
of uncertainty in recent days is indicated by the increased volume of
demand for forward DM which the Bundesbank was having to meet until it
suspended its forward sales today.
Interest rate differentials between U. S. and European national
markets, which were narrowed by the rise in U. S. short-term rates after
mid-March and by the effects of reductions in discount and other leading
rates made by the Bundesbank and the Bank of England on April 1 and by
some other central banks shortly thereafter, have been further affected
by the marked easing of the German money market caused by the massive in-
flows of funds in March and early April. The key call money rate has
fallen since then to 2 percent compared with 7-1/2 per cent at the end
of March. German 3-month interbank loans are now down to 6-1/8 per cent.
Incoming data have shown some strengthening of the current
economic situation in Germany in January and February. German domestic
demand for machinery was given a boost by changes in depreciation allow-
ances at the beginning of the year, and the period of retrenchment

I -7
in business inventory policies that started in the spring of 1970
seems to have ended. As prices and wages are continuing to rise
fairly strongly, the German government is unlikely to move soon to-
ward an easier fiscal policy. On the other hand, the Bundesbank will
hesitate to take measures to mop up the banks' excess reserves while
exchange rate speculation is still in the air.
Since early April, the U. S. balance of payments has con-
tinued in sizable deficit on both the usual bases of measurement--
though not quite so heavily as before. The reduction of U. S. banks'
liabilities to their overseas branches in this period has been about
matched by the U. S. Treasury's special borrowing from the branches.
U. S. foreign trade figures for March show a jump in exports
that month and no change in imports. Commercial aircraft exports were
at unsustainably high levels. As imports are likely to rise, we expect
somewhat lower net exports of goods and services in the second quarter
than on average in the first quarter.
The outlook for U. S. corporate and other private capital
movements and for foreign purchases of U. S. securities during the
second quarter is not as bright as would have been hoped for at the
beginning of the year, mainly because of the widespread uneasiness
about future exchange rates.

THE ECONOMIC PICTURE IN DETAIL
Domestic Nonfinancial Scene
Gross national product. GNP increased by $28-1/2 billion in
the first quarter according to preliminary Commerce Department estimates,
$1 billion more than our last Greenbook projection. A larger increase
than we had anticipated in State and local government purchases--mainly
construction--was partially offset by a slightly smaller increase in
business fixed investment. Other differences in outlays were minor.
The increase in real GNP for the quarter was 6-1/2 per cent, annual rate.
The GNP deflator also rose somewhat more than we had assumed--
5.2 per cent rather than 4.7 per cent. Excluding the effects of
compositional shifts, the deflator for the private sector rose slightly
less in the first quarter than in the fourth--4.8 per cent, compared to
5.1 per cent.
There were also differences between the Commerce estimates
and our projections for the first quarter due to the handling of the
proposed liberalized depreciation schedules. In last month's Greenbook
we had assumed that the new schedules would be implemented during the
first quarter, effective the first of the year; this implementation has
not as yet occurred. As a result, both corporate profits and personal
income (proprietors income) for the first quarter are somewhat larger
than we had estimated, as are Federal government revenues. With
personal and disposable income higher, the saving rate is estimated by
OBE at 7.2 per cent in the first quarter rather than the 6.9 per cent

II -2
we had projected. We have adjusted our projections of these components
for the remainder of 1971 to exclude the estimated impact of the
liberalized schedules, pending a final Administration decision.

We are now projecting a GNP increase of $19 billion for the
second quarter. This is $2 billion more than estimated last month, reflecting
largely the firmer tone in consumer markets evident in recent weeks and the
assumption that this will persist. Retail sales picked up toward the end
of the first quarter and weekly figures suggest that this strength has
carried forward into April. Sales of nondurable goods in particular have

II -3
rebounded briskly following a lackluster performance in the first
two months which was associated with a rise of only $1 billion in
nondurable outlays in the first quarter. We are now projecting an
increase of over $5 billion for nondurable outlays in the current
quarter, $1-1/2 billion more than a month ago. Our projections of
changes in other sectors of consumer purchases are little different
from last month; we still anticipate a small increase in domestic
type unit auto sales to an 8.3 million annual rate, although sales in
the first 20 days of April continued at about the 8.1 million rate of
the first quarter.
We now also expect a slightly larger increase in residential
construction outlays this quarter, reflecting the surprisingly strong
rise in new residential housing starts in March. However, we see no
firm evidence as yet that underlying trends in housing are significantly
stronger than we had projected for the year as a whole, and thus we
have not revised our projections of starts for the second and
subsequent quarters.
Other sectors remain about as projected last month. We
have not revised the second quarter projection of State and local
government expenditures despite the extraordinarily sharp increase
in the first quarter. Our estimates for the remainder of the year
had already incorporated a substantially larger increase in State
and local government construction activity than the average quarterly
gain during 1970; we believe that some of the surge in spending last
quarter represented a catch-up in spending that is likely to be
non-recurring.

II -4
We have revised up slightly our price projections for the
second and subsequent quarters of 1971, as a result both of the
somewhat disappointing performance of the price deflator in the first
quarter and the less-than-expected improvement in unit labor costs in
the past half year. But with current dollar GNP projected to rise
somewhat more strongly this quarter than formerly estimated, real
GNP is expected to increase around 3 per cent, annual rate, a bit
more than we had projected last month.

We still anticipate stronger growth of overall demand in
the second half than in the current quarter and have made only very
minor changes in our projections. Final sales are expected to increase
by an average of about $22 billion per quarter, up from an expected
rise of over $16 billion in the second quarter. The projected pattern
of GNP changes in the last two quarters is affected strongly by the
assumption of a steel strike of about 60 days duration, commencing
about August 1. A sharp reduction in inventory investment is likely
in the third quarter (strike or no) as steel stocks are liquidated.
Nevertheless, third quarter growth in current dollar GNP is projected
to be as large as in the second quarter ($19 billion), supported in
part by an expected military pay increase at mid-year and a retroactive
rise in Social Security benefits paid out late in June. GNP should
increase substantially more--we are projecting a $26 billion rise--in
the last quarter as a result of a rebound in inventory investment
following the working down of steel stocks, a moderate acceleration
in business fixed investment, and a relatively strong gain in consumer
outlays.
In real terms, GNP in the second half of 1971 is projected
to rise at an annual rate of 4-1/4 per cent--about in line with long
term potential growth. With continued gains in productivity and a
resumption of more rapid increases in the labor force likely to accompany
increased growth, we expect unemployment to be somewhat higher than in
the first half, averaging almost 6-1/2 per cent in the last two quarters.

Industrial production. The lack of a definite trend in
industrial production since the recovery from the GM strike and the
limited output data available for April make it difficult at this
point to estimate the likely change in the index from March to April.
However, industrial production probably edged up somewhat further in
April. Declines in auto production and in business and defense
equipment are estimated to be somewhat more than offset by a rise in
steel and increases in consumer staples, household goods, and materials
other than steel.
Auto assemblies in April have been at an annual rate of 8.2
million units, down 8 per cent from March and a decline of 0.2 point
in the total index. The April decline and the 8.2 million unit rate
of output now scheduled for the second quarter as a whole, reflect the
continuing moderate pace of new domestic car sales and the near-completion
of rebuilding of GM dealers' inventories. On the expansive side,
production of television sets was up about 10 per cent in the first two
weeks of April.
Output of business equipment in March was down 15 per cent
from the September-October 1969 high. The mixed nature of the February-
March developments in this sector--industrial equipment and commercial
aircraft down, a recovery of farm equipment from the February strike-
induced low, and a one month rise in commercial equipment--provide little
indication as to whether the extended production cutbacks in business
equipment are nearing an end.

II -9
Among materials, output of raw steel and presumably steel
mill products rose further in April, probably enough to offset the
decline in autos and auto parts. The large rise in output of iron
and steel in anticipation of a strike this summer--up 20 per cent since
last November--is about over. Among other materials, production data
for the first two weeks of April indicate some increase in paperboard,
coal, and crude petroleum.

Retail sales. Seasonally adjusted retail sales in April are
estimated to be 1 per cent higher than March, based on data for the
three weeks ending April 17. While it is still too soon to conclude
that consumers are shifting toward a more optimistic buying mood,
recent sales indicate a definite pickup from the sluggish performance
of most sectors earlier in the year.
For durable goods, April sales may be about 1/2 per cent
higher than March, with automotive sales increasing 1 per cent and
furniture and appliance sales little changed. Nondurable goods sales,
which showed little or no increase in the first two months, appear to
be following a 1-1/2 per cent March increase with a 1-1/4 per cent
rise in April. Strength this month largely reflects higher sales of
general merchandise and apparel.

Unit auto sales. Sales of new domestic type autos rose
sharply in the first 10 days of April--when an incentive contest
for a major make was completed--and declined sharply in the second
10 days. For the first 20 days of the month, sales were at an 8.1
million unit rate, about the level prevailing since January.

February, up slightly from January but far below the $5.0 billion
rate of February 1970. Preliminary reports from a small number of
commercial banks indicate that the increase in March for this holder
group will be about the same as in February. The February increase
was the result about equally of advances in automobile credit and
personal loans.
Commercial banks in many areas of the country have been actively
promoting the availability of funds for consumer instalment lending.
In part this may account for the improvement in bank lending relative
to finance companies. Instalment credit outstanding at commercial banks
expanded at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $1.3 billion in February,
while finance company credit outstanding contracted somewhat more than that.

Manufacturers' orders and shipments. New orders for durable
goods declined 2.2 per cent in March, according to the advance report,
from a February level which has been revised upward since that month's
advance report and now shows an increase of 1.5 per cent instead of a
1.7 per cent decrease. The March decline was accounted for mainly by
a fallback of defense orders from a very high February level and to a
lesser extent by declines in autos and steel. Orders excluding these
three categories rose 1.3 per cent, rising slightly above the range
within which they had fluctuated for more than a year, and reaching
the highest point since late 1969.
The decline in iron and steel orders was anticipated, since
such orders ordinarily peak early in a year in which wage negotiations
are coming up. The backlog of iron and steel orders remains high--
slightly above the previous high of early 1965. Motor vehicle orders
were off slightly. The highly erratic defense orders series droppped
considerably from a February level that apparently included large
shipbuilding orders.
Capital equipment orders declined slightly from an upward-
revised February figure; the level of orders for this group has changed
little since November 1970. New orders increased for "all other"
durables, about half of which are construction materials. There also
appears to have been some recovery recently in orders for household
durables, and the March level was 7 per cent above a year earlier.

Shipments increased and the order backlog declined 0.6 per
cent. The decline in the backlog was mainly at the aircraft industry,
and was reflected in both the defense and the capital equipment groups.
Inventories. Book value of business inventories rose at a
$4 billion annual rate in February, according to preliminary data; this
was little different from the upward-revised January rate or from the
fourth quarter. A large increase in trade inventories more than offset
a decline in manufacturing. Since November, book value increases have
been confined to the sectors directly affected by the GM strike and by
steel inventory-building--auto, steel, and rubber manufacturing, automotive
and metals wholesaling, and auto dealers. Elsewhere, stocks have
declined.

The business inventory-sales ratio declined slightly further
in February. More than half of the improvement in this ratio since its
November high has been in the auto-steel sector, where sales have risen
faster than stocks, due mainly to the catch-up in auto buying. Although
stocks have declined and sales improved, in the rest of manufacturing
and trade, the ratios for these sectors are still slightly above those
of last June. This is particularly true in trade, where the ratio
excluding autos and steel had declined only slightly as of February. The
apparent improvement of non-auto retail sales in March and April may
help to reduce further the inventory-sales ratio in this area.

In March, dealers' stocks of new autos increased further,
according to seasonally adjusted unit data, and by the end of that
month amounted to a 58 days' supply. This was a higher ratio than
at the end of February, in spite of increased March sales, but this
level is not abnormal compared with other periods in which the sales
rate was similar. According to unadjusted data, the supply of GM
cars was still somewhat below year-earlier ratios, while non-GM
dealers had some excess inventory compared with March 1970.
Cyclical indicators. The Census composite leading indicator
rose 0.6 per cent in March, based on preliminary data. Since its low
point in October, when series affected by the GM strike brought the
composite back down to its May 1970 level, this index has risen each
month for a total increase of over 5 per cent. This rise is a little
below the average five-month rate of recovery in this series from lows
reached during earlier postwar contractions, but it compares favorably
with the rebound from the 1959 steel strike low. The coincident and
lagging composites also rose by around half a per cent in March.

II -16
Leading series rising in March were the manufacturing work-
week, housing permits, industrial materials prices, and common stock
prices. The ratio of price to unit labor cost was unchanged. Negative
influences came from initial unemployment claims, new orders for durable
goods, and contracts and orders for plant and equipment.
Residential construction and real estate. Seasonally adjusted
private housing starts turned sharply upward in March to an annual rate
of 1.92 million units. This was not far from the 2.05 million high
reached last December when there was a contra-seasonal surge in FHA-
insured subsidized units. Moreover, in the first quarter as a whole,
starts actually edged above the fourth quarter. Including mobile home
shipments--currently running at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
400,000--the combined shelter total for the quarter was the highest on
record, exceeding the 2.1 million peak indicated for the second quarter
of 1950 when, of course, mobile home shipments were an insignificant factor.
Contributing strongly to the first quarter pace of housing
starts was a further advance in multifamily units. Unlike single-family
starts, which dipped somewhat, these continued upward to a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 805,000 and eclipsed the previous peak registered
two years earlier. Regionally, the advance was marked in the West,
where total starts rose considerably further to the highest rate since
the fourth quarter of 1963.

but a tenth below the peak in October 1969.
2/ Based on unadjusted totals for all periods. FHA-insured starts
include both subsidized and nonsubsidized units.
With mortgage commitments made by savings and loan associations
continuing to climb to new peaks and builders' plans pointing higher,
some further increase in starts is indicated for the second quarter.
Because of technical measurement problems and other factors, however,
a sag perhaps to a 1.8 million unit rate is a possibility for April._
f

II -18
Meanwhile, effective demands for both new and used residential
units have apparently improved further in response to the marked liberali-
zation of mortgage interest rates and other terms over the past year and
the increased concentration of builders on lower-priced units. Release
last mid-March of additional funds for FHA's major subsidy program, as
described in the previous Greenbook, should also lend further support to
this trend. In addition, the recent restoration of unused home loan
underwriting benefits to veterans of World War II and the Korean conflict
under the Veterans Housing Act passed last year has continued to prove
helpful, particularly in the market for existing homes.
Residential vacancy rates thus far have remained exceptionally
low. For rental units, the average of 4.9 per cent of units available
and fit for use in the first quarter of the year was little changed from
the previous quarter and the lowest for any first quarter since 1957.
Vacancy rates for home-owner properties also held at a reduced rate
nationally and in most regions.

Plant and equipment spending. The McGraw-Hill April survey
(confidential until 4-30-71) indicates that business plans to spend
about 4 per cent more for new plant and equipment in 1971 than in 1970.
This anticipated increase is about the same as reported in the February
Commerce-SEC survey, but is above the 2 per cent increase shown in the
fall McGraw-Hill survey. All of the expected increase is in the non-
manufacturing sector--especially electric utilities. Manufacturers as a
whole expecte no increase, with a 3 per cent gain in nondurable goods
spending offset by a 2 per cent drop in spending by durable goods producers.

Labor market. Productivity rose sharply in the first quarter,
advancing at an annual rate of 5.3 per cent in the private sector. The
sharp rise in total output following the GM strike, coupled with the more
modest recovery of employment and hours, was responsible for the large gain.
For the fourth and first quarters averaged together the rate of increase
was 2.7 per cent.

II -20
Over the past year as a whole, productivity increased 3.3 per
cent, a substantial improvement over the average for the previous several
years. Increases in compensation per manhour have continued at a rapid
pace, but with productivity advancing again, unit labor cost increases
have slowed from the sharp increases of 1969 and early 1970, particularly
in the nonmanufacturing sector. However, increases in unit labor costs
continue at a rapid pace in manufacturing, where output is still well
below earlier peak levels.

Increases in compensation per manhour (which includes fringe
benefits) and average hourly earnings continued to be rapid in late
1970 and early 1971. In the first quarter, compensation per manhour
in the private economy was 7.3 per cent higher than a year earlier and
average hourly earnings of production workers were up 6.3 per cent.
Increases in average hourly earnings accelerated in manufacturing and
transportation, reflecting to a large extent recent collective
bargaining settlements in the automobile industry and large pay raises
in both the railroad and trucking sectors. Some moderation of wage
growth has occurred in trade.

Industrial relations. The Construction Industry Stabilization
Committee has approved the first wage and benefit increase subject to
its review. Ironworkers in the Dallas-Fort Worth area negotiated a
two-year settlement providing for a 30-cent increase effective April 1,
1971 to be followed at six-month intervals by wage and benefit increases
of 40, 30, and 40 cents respectively. The 30-cent immediate increase
(about 5 per cent) was ruled by the Ironworkers "craft dispute board"
to fall within the limits imposed by the Executive Order issued by the
President in March. However, the board indicated the union would have
to supply additional information justifying the remaining $1.10 increases
before they could be approved.
Settlements by other unions in the North Texas area included
in the two-year multicraft contract covering 18,000 construction
workers in 20 unions will be reviewed by the appropriate craft boards
when they have been established. The master contract provides that
wage and benefit increases total $1.10 for workers making less than
$5.00 an hour and $1.40 for those making $5.00 or more. These increases
would seem to average at least 10 per cent a year--rather than the 6
per cent general limit imposed by the Executive Order.
In the cement industry contracts covering 9,000 workers
expire May 1. A two-year agreement with one company in April that
is expected to set the pattern for the rest of the industry provides
for a 9 per cent first-year wage increase.

II -23
Construction materials prices, Prices of construction
materials increased sharply during the first quarter of 1971. The
rise was largely a result of higher prices for lumber and wood
products which now appear to be leveling off or even declining.
Other construction materials price advances have accelerated this
year.
Prices of lumber and wood products in the construction
materials index declined more than 4-1/2 per cent in 1970 but rose
more than 12 per cent in the first quarter of 1971. In part higher
prices have reflected new softwood size standards which reduced
lumber dimensions while nominal prices were maintained.
Other construction materials, which had increased only about
3 per cent during all 1970, rose about 1-3/4 per cent in the first
quarter of 1971. Some of the largest increases were posted for flat
glass, concrete ingredients and products, hard surface floor
coverings, soil pipe, gypsum products, structural shapes, and asphalt
roofing. In contrast, there were large declines in prices of building
wire and nonmetallic sheathed cable during the first quarter, especially
in March.

Consumer prices. Consumer prices rose in March at a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2.7 per cent as the effects of a
substantial drop in mortgage interest rates partially offset a sharp
increase in food prices. Other commodities, on average, continued
to rise more slowly than last year.
Declining mortgage costs were also the main factor in the
sharply reduced rise of consumer prices over the first quarter--when the
consumer price index increased at a rate of 2.4 per cent (unadjusted).
If mortgage costs had been excluded, the rise would have been at a
rate of almost 4 per cent (also unadjusted), according to confidential
estimates supplied by the BLS. Well over half of the increase in
other service costs was offset by a drop in expenses for home financing.
Excluding these, the rate of rise for services accelerated to about
8.5 per cent, higher than the previous peak in the first quarter of
1970.

Food prices rose substantially in the first quarter after
leveling off in the second half of last year. Much of the climb came
in March, when both meat and fresh fruits and vegetables rose sharply.
Retail prices of beef at chain stores rose further in April but pork
declined,
Part of the easing in non-food commodities in the first quarter
can be attributed to declining gasoline prices and to a leveling off in
apparel prices. However, gasoline prices remain above early last year
and mens' clothing prices rose in March at a record rate. A notable
feature of first quarter developments was a leveling in home prices,
which had previously been the fastest rising component among commodities.
New car prices, however, rose strongly last quarter--in part because of
delays in getting 1971 models onto the market--but fell in March.

March 1, 1971 prices of farm land. Land values rose 3 per
cent in the year ending March 1, 1971, the fourth successive year of a
decelerating rate of rise. In the past year, values continued to boom
along the east coast and to advance at very slow rates in the great
agricultural areas of the nation. These disparate trends have been
in evidence for the past three or four years.
Tight credit conditions have been a major factor in the
slowdown in values in areas where demand for land is principally for
agricultural uses. General uncertainty attending the protracted
legislative review of the wheat, feed grain, and cotton programs prior
to enactment of new legislation in late 1970 has been another. More
recently the corn blight has entered the picture.

II -27
Along the populous east coast, an important factor supporting
land values is the actual and the expected future demand for nonfarm
uses. Undoubtedly, the booming demand for recreation homes is an
important element of strength. In the Southeast, values continue to
be influenced by new farming practices and technology as well as growing
demands for nonfarm uses.
Apparently tight credit conditions have dampened demands for
land in the agricultural areas more than in areas with large nonfarm
demands. Respondents to the March 1, 1971 survey cited easing interest
rates in recent months as a reason for expecting a pickup in values in
major farming areas in the months ahead. In fact, the March 1 data
show some evidence of strengthening since November in some areas.

THE ECONOMIC PICTURE IN DETAIL
Domestic Financial Situation
Monetary aggregates. All monetary aggregates continued to
increase rapidly in March, as rates of growth slowed only moderately from
the exceptionally strong February pace. As the table indicates, with
these further strong advances, first quarter rates of growth in the three
money supply concepts were substantially above those of the fourth
quarter and also well above those of earlier quarters of 1970.
A further rise in the adjusted credit proxy also was recorded
in March. The rate of increase was somewhat slower than in February,
however, as growth of private demand deposits and time and savings
deposits slackened and U.S. Treasury deposits dropped sharply. In
addition, nondeposit liabilities declined markedly, particularly
borrowings from foreign branches. This in part reflected the financing
of foreign branch acquisitions of export-import bank certificates; but
even after allowing for these transactions, the runoff was still quite
large.
Data for the first two weeks in April indicate that M1 in-
creased substantially further. M2 also rose significantly further over
this period, although at a slower pace than in March, as the rate of
growth in time and savings deposits diminished. Inflows of consumer-type
deposits at weekly reporting banks in particular appear to have moderated,
quite possibly in reaction to the impact of the recent reductions in rates
offered on these deposits by many banks as well as to the corresponding

rise in rates on competing market instruments. Growth in total time and
savings deposits at country member banks also appears to have been at
a slower pace.
During the latter part of March, outstanding amounts of large
CD's declined when rates on competing money market instruments began to
rise. The weakening was particularly apparent at weekly reporting banks
outside New York and Chicago. At banks in the latter cities, on the
other hand, the late March declines were reversed in early April in
part reflecting efforts on the part of these banks to position themselves
to repay maturing CD's around the mid-month tax date.
Growth in the adjusted credit proxy also slowed further in
early April, reflecting not only the reduced rate of total time deposit
growth but also a continued marked decline in nondeposit liabilities.
Head office liabilities to foreign branches dropped sharply further,
largely in connection with foreign branch acquisitions of $1.5 billion
of special Treasury certificates.
Bank credit. Total loans and investments of commercial banks,
adjusted for loan transfers between banks and their affiliates, increased
at an annual rate of almost 13 per cent from the last Wednesday of
February to the last Wednesday of March, about the same as the rate over
February. The increase over the first quarter as a whole was almost 14
per cent. The bulk of the March credit expansion was in security
acquisitions, both Treasury and other. Over the first quarter, bank
holdings of Treasury securities and other securities increased at annual
rates of about 22 per cent and 30 per cent, respectively.

Total loans also increased somewhat in March but at a signi-
ficantly slower pace than in January and February. The annual rate of
increase for the first quarter was slightly more than 7 per cent. The
March weakening in the expansion in loan portfolios was the result of a
sharp downturn in business loans that partly offset generally moderate
gains in other loan categories. The drop in business loans, which followed
a two month period of fairly strong advance, in part reflected relatively
small loan demand over the mid-month tax date. In addition, the volume
of repayments of bank loans with funds obtained from capital market
financings picked up in March after having moderated earlier in the quarter.
With the March decline, business loan growth for the first quarter was
held to a modest 2.5 per cent annual rate.

III -5
Seasonally adjusted weekly reporting bank data suggest that
commercial bank credit continued rising during the first two weeks in
April, again mainly in the form of substantial acquisition of securities.
Bank acquisition of Treasury issues--mainly in connection with the April
6 Treasury financing operation--accounted for part of the further advance
in investment holdings. Growth in holdings of other securities also
remained substantial, as municipal securities, in particular, rose sharply
early in the month.
Total loans also increased further in early April, spurred by a
sharp increase in loans to brokers and dealers, which reflected a build-up
in dealer investories, primarily in connection with the Treasury financing
operation and a large system matched-sale purchase arrangement. Other
major loan categories, on the other hand, changed only moderately with
gains in some categories offsetting declines in others. Business loans
rose slightly over the two weeks ending April 14, but data from New York
reporting banks suggest that loan demands weakened over the tax payment
date--business loans at these banks declined by $5 million in the week
ending April 21 in contrast to increases averaging about $275 million
in the comparable weeks of the three preceding years.
Many large banks raised their prime lending rate at the end of
last week from 5-1/4 per cent to 5-1/2 per cent. This advance in the face
of continued sluggish demands for loans was attributed to the rise in
short-term market rates that had taken place since the prime rate was
last reduced in early March. It also reflected the decision of a number
of major banks to adjust their lending rates more frequently in response
to changes in other short-term rates.

III -6
Nonbank thrift institutions. The most recent data suggest
that nonbank depositary intermediaries are continuing to receive his-
torically large deposit inflows, with as yet little sign of abatement.
Indeed, during the recently-concluded reinvestment period, savings and
loan associations received net new deposits of about a billion dollars,
nearly all of which occurred during the first ten days of April. Simi-
larly, New York City mutual savings banks received contraseasonal net in-
flows during the reinvestment period, although in relatively smaller
volume.

The bulk of recent deposit inflows has continued to be in
term accounts, which would not be withdrawn quickly in reaction to an
adverse change in the now-favorable yield relationship between deposits
and market securities. Not only do the minimum term requirements enhance

III -7
the stability of such accounts, but in addition, where early withdrawal
is possible only with a penalty such as at savings and loan associations,
a shift to other assets prior to maturity would generally occur only if
alternative yields rose by enough to cover the interest foregone by early
withdrawal.

The FHLBB has reacted to the large deposit inflows at S and
L's by raising the required ratio of liquid assets another notch--from
the 6.5 per cent (of deposits plus borrowed funds) just introduced on
April 1 to 7.5 per cent effective May 1. This action was explained by
the FHLBB as a counter-cyclical use of liquidity requirements as well as

III -8
an attempt to try to stem repayments of outstanding advances; there is
reason to believe that it might have some of this intended impact because
those associations with the largest "excess" liquid assets generally are
not those with advances outstanding. For example, on an aggregate basis,
the industry at the end of March had liquid assets in excess of the new
7.5 per cent requirement amounting to about $7 billion. But according to
FHLB staff tabulations of the individual associations, those institutions
with outstanding advances had excess liquid assets sufficient to repay
only about $3.3 billion in advances.1/
During the first quarter, savings and loan associations
acquired, net, an unprecedented volume of liquid assets--partly to restore
liquidity levels, partly to store funds for takedowns of mortgage commit-
ments and for repayment of advances, and partly, it seems, for lack of
alternative outlets. Despite the FHLBB's prepayment penalties on maturing
fixed term advances, the net amount of borrowed funds at savings and loans
declined by over one billion dollars. The record volume of mortgage
loans purchased, on the heels of large purchases in the previous two
quarters, suggests the extent to which associations were endeavoring to
translate their increased funds into earning assets. The resultant easing
in mortgage market conditions is suggested by the continued large

of future deposit inflows; but it is indicative of the skewed
distribution within the S&L industry of liquid assets and advances.

Mutual savings banks' portfolio behavior during the first
quarter contrasted sharply with that of savings and loan associations.
While gross flow data are not available for the savings banks, on net
their mortgage portfolio did not share in the increased funds available.
Although liquid assets were rebuilt modestly, by far the greatest share
of the fund flow increase was allocated to corporate and federal agency
securities. The greater relative emphasis on securities may reflect the
relatively greater speed with which those assets can be acquired--the
lead time between commitment of funds and takedowns on mortgages being
much longer, especially at a time of such rapid easing in market conditions.
However, at least some of the profile of asset choices of mutual savings
banks is a reflection of the higher relative yields that still are avail-
able on corporate securities, particularly in contrast with single-family
mortgages.

Mortgage market. With deposit flows to thrift institutions
remaining exceptionally strong, both new and outstanding commitments
at savings and loan associations surged in March to new highs that were
sharply above year-earlier lows. Contributing to the S&L commitment
uptrend over the past year have been large increases in loan refinancing
volume as well as in mortgage purchases, as noted in the preceding section.
Both have underscored the general improvement that has taken place in
mortgage market conditions. While savings banks in New York State
continued to increase their mortgage commitments through February, their

commitment backlog was still three-tenths below the highs of early 1969.
As mentioned above, the savings bank industry has stepped up its purchases
of corporate and federal agency issues.
In the first quarter, net total credit flows on all types of
mortgages through the major institutional lenders for which current
data are available were about the same as the advance total of the fourth
quarter of 1970, despite a record seasonally adjusted rate of S&L net
lending during the first three months of this year. Additional support
from mutual savings banks and commercial banks provided an aggregate net
flow of funds from these three major type lenders in the first quarter
that was significantly larger than the high rate of the preceding quarter.

III -13
As mortgage flows from these sources expanded, however, net support from
FNMA and GNMA was reduced further. In fact, the two housing credit
agencies ran down their total mortgage holdings slightly for the first
time in six years, owing partly to FNMA's portfolio sales.

With no further increase in the rate of net mortgage lending
during the first quarter, with home mortgages continuing relatively
unattractive to nonbank diversified lenders as compared with new corporate
bond issues, and with investor uncertainty about the future course of
interest rates generally, yields in the sensitive secondary market for
Government-underwritten home mortgages stabilized during March and early
April, and then turned upward later in April, as confirmed by trade
opinion as well as by FNMA's purchase auctions.1/ These developments,
along with the prospect of further sharp seasonal increases in mortgage
credit demands through the spring, appear to have eliminated earlier

Rates on conventional first mortgages for new-home purchase declined
less during March than in either of the preceding two months. Nevertheless,
at 7.60 per cent, they averaged 100 basis points below last year's peak.
In the normally capital-deficit regions of the Southwest and the West,
even larger declines were reported. By March, regional rate differentials
had narrowed to the lowest margins since the early 1960's, when mortgage
credit was also in unusually abundant supply.

On a 25-year conventional home loan, the 100 basis point rate
decline has reduced the burden of debt service per dollar borrowed by
about 8 per cent. However, indications are that year-over-year increases
in average loan amounts as well as in such operating expenses as utilities
and property taxes and insurance have offset at least part of the
beneficial impact of lower interest rates on total monthly cash expenditures
for new conventionally-financed dwellings. These units still account for
the bulk of all new 1-family home purchases.

Life insurance companies. Easing of general credit conditions
in the first quarter apparently increased the volume of life insurance
company lendable funds. With interest rates lower and bank credit
availability increased, drains of investment funds into policy loans
tapered off to a pace less than one-third that of a year earlier.

(p) preliminary.
While complete data on fund sources are not yet available, an increase
in discretionary fund flows is reflected in the recent sharp increase
of new investment commitments at life companies. Moreover, new commit-
ment activity appears to be receiving added impetus as the industry has
become more willing to commit an increased portion of its projected
cash flow. Even as recently as the end of last year, an unusually small
percentage of investment funds expected over the next six months was
allocated to commitments with takedowns scheduled over that same period.
Such a strategy implied that the industry was endeavoring to maintain
flexibility should its fund flow projections prove too optimistic.

III -17
For all of these reasons, total new commitment activity by a
sample of life insurance companies during February reached the largest
volume in eighteen months, with most of that increase represented by a
restoration of the earlier volume of securities commitments. New commit-
ments for corporate direct placements--as reported by a slightly smaller
industry sample--increased significantly during the first quarter to the
highest quarterly rate in over two years (STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL). Most
of the increase in direct placement commitment activity was represented
by higher-quality issuers and by issues other than those with equity
features.

Corporate and municipal securities. In late March growing
investor resistance developed to the reduced yield levels then pre-
vailing in the long-term market, and rates on corporate and tax-exempt
bonds rose steadily in April. Investor expectations of an upward
trend in long-term interest rates were based on rising short-term rates
and a growing market view that monetary policy had tightened and the
economic outlook had improved.
The sharp upward movement of corporate bond yields in early
April, coupled with technical delays incurred by some SEC registrants,
resulted in a postponement of several large issues and a less rapid
build-up in the calendar than had been anticipated. Although these
postponements had already reduced the staff's original $3.0 billion
estimate for April corporate public bond offerings, a last minute
rescheduling of a large issue from last April to May further lowered
the April projection. The staff now estimates that the April public
bond volume will be $2.3 billion, and that May will amount to $2.7 billion.

A major factor in the tapering of the recent and prospective
pace of public bond offerings appears to be the reduced number of very
large individual issues by industrial corporations. In March, 50 per
cent of the dollar volume had been accounted for by issues of $100
million or more, whereas such issues amount to only about one-third
of the lower April and estimated May volume. The industrial composi-
tion of the public bond offerings in April and May also is more typical
of the 1970 pattern, with issues by manufacturing firms accounting for
about one-quarter of the volume, instead of one-half, as in March.

As noted earlier, life insurance company commitment activity
has increased markedly in recent months, but because of lags this did
not have much influence on takedowns until March 1971. There appears
to have been a sharp upturn in that month and the staff now estimates
that April and May private placements will be above the depressed
average level of 1970.
Stimulated by a buoyant stock market, the volume of new
equity issues appears to have remained slightly over $1 billion in both
March and April. Scheduled stock offerings for May have not increased
rapidly in recent weeks, however, and the staff has revised its May
estimate down to $700 million.
Tax-exempt long-term bond offerings continue at historically
high levels. The March volume reached $2.2 billion, and the staff
expects that both April and May will be about $2 billion, Rates on
municipal bonds have increased about 45 basis points since the last
Committee meeting, reflecting mainly sympathetic reaction to pressures
in other sectors of the long-term markets. Continued heavy purchases
by commercial banks in the short- and intermediate-term area and by
fire and casualty companies in the long end have sustained the market
in the face of record issue volume.

gross offerings in both months exceeded sales of long-term bonds,
Tax anticipation notes accounted for a growing proportion of short-
term tax-exempt securities in recent months, perhaps reflecting the
difficulties of some State and local authorities in meeting current
operating expenses.
Stock market. In April, investors continued to project a
sharp improvement in 1972 corporate profits and stock prices main-
tained the recent rate of advance that has made the recovery from 1970
lows one of the most rapid in recent years. As of late April, both
the NYSE index and Dow Jones Industrial Average of stock prices had

III -22
advanced about 50 per cent from their May 1970 lows and were about 5
per cent below their 1968 all-time highs. On the other hand,
perhaps reflecting a relatively diminished investor preference for
lower quality stocks during the rally of the last eight months, the
AMEX index--which had previously declined more than the NYSE index--
was up only a little over one-third in the same period and remains
20 per cent below its 1968 high.
Trading volume during April continued at historically high
levels. The combined daily average of NYSE and AMEX volume thus far
in 1971 has been 23.4 million shares vs. 15 million shares for all of
1970. Despite the large volume on the organized exchanges, indications
are that brokerage back-office problems have remained manageable.
Fails to deliver--the generally accepted indicator of brokerage back-
office problems--are up from 1970, but for the first three and a half
months of 1971 have remained relatively constant, fluctuating between
$1.6 and $1.8 billion. This average is considerably below the peak
of $4.1 billion reached in December 1968.
At a meeting on April 19 at the SEC--attended by Board staff--
representatives of the NYSE, AMEX and regional exchanges expressed
confidence that, while the present level of trading had increased the
potential for back-office problems, the brokerage industry was able to
handle adequately the current volume. Reasons given for this
confidence include the exchanges and NASD's increased awareness of the
problems involved and their installation over the last year of greatly

III -23
improved surveillance systems designed to detect early signs of back-
office trouble with any brokerage firm. In addition it was pointed
out that back-office problems have been reduced by the smaller volume of
trading in OTC markets and increased average size of stock trades--from
approximately 260 shares per trade in 1968 to 420 shares in 1971.
This is apparently due to increased institutional activity,
An analysis of the composition of NYSE transactions shows
that, between late 1968 and early 1970, institutions increased their
share of NYSE volume from 10 per cent to 15 per cent. In addition,
over the same period odd lot trades and trades of 100 shares, in which
most individual investor activity is concentrated, showed a significant
decline as a proportion of the total volume. These trends seem to be
continuing in 1971.
It is too soon to ascertain whether the initiation of nego-
tiated commissions for trades over $500,000 has significantly altered
trading patterns. Preliminary evidence received thus far indicates
that the number of trades over $500,000 has increased slightly, but
is impossible to know yet if this reflects negotiated rates or merely
enthusiastic trading associated with the market rally.

III -24
Government securities market. Interest rates in the U. S.
Government securities market have risen on balance since early April,
but more recently longer term yields have tended to stabilize. Over
the period April 6-April 27 as a whole, yields on notes and bonds rose
by 25 to 85 basis points, while bill rates are now 25 to 70 basis points
higher than at the time of the April Committee meeting. The 3-month
bill, which reached a high of 4.04 per cent on April 13, was most
recently bid at 3.96 per cent.

The tightening of the Federal funds market that immediately
followed the April 6 meeting of the Committee was a major reason for
the rise in bill rates that took place and also contributed to the
weakening in the Treasury coupon sector. With their positions in
bills still swollen by the series of offerings at the end of March,
the rise in their financing costs, as well as the accompanying shift
in expectations regarding the System's policy stance, made dealers
increasingly restive with their holdings. At the same time the level
of investor demand for bills fell short of expectations, perhaps as
buyers looked toward even more attractive rates. Both of these
factors worked to push rates higher. After mid-April actual and
prospective bill demands improved; and with positions reduced by low
auction awards and tax bill maturities, rates retreated from their
highs. Most recently, however, bill yields have again tended to increase.
The weakening of the coupon-bearing sector of the market
has been due in some degree to the tightening of day-to-day money
market conditions, coupled perhaps with some disappointment at the
Desk's relative lack of activity in the coupon market after a fairly
regular series of purchases beginning in early February. Equally
if not more important, however, was the market's expectation of a
Treasury debt lengthening operation in May. On the basis of these
various factors, price levels were reassessed and speculative investors,
including banks, reduced their holdings, with the result that prices

III -26
adjusted sharply lower. Most recently, trading has generally stabilized
as the market participants have begun to doubt that the Treasury will
lengthen the debt aggressively in light of the recent market weakness.

The Treasury is expected to announce on April 28 the terms
for refunding of $5.8 billion
May; details will be given in
may at the same time indicateof publicly held issues maturing in mid-
the Greenbook Supplement. The Treasury
in general its plans for raising new

III -27-
cash. It would appear that new cash might not be needed until late
May or early June, and that some $2-$3 billion over and above any
amount required to cover attrition in the refinancing would finance
the Treasury's cash needs until early July.
In the market for Federal agencies, new offerings in April
were smaller than the $650 million reduction in FHLB issues, thus
yielding a net decline in new cash of $461 million. For the first
four months of 1971 this results in a net repayment of debt of $0.3
billion as compared to net borrowing of $4.2 billion in the corres-
ponding period last year. The move toward longer maturities continues,
with FNMA offering $150 million of 6-year 1-month and $250 million of
3-year 7-month issues. Despite the relatively small volume of new
issues, yields in the agency market have risen steadily since mid-
March when the lows were reached. As can be seen in the market yields
table, rates on agency issues have risen 80 to 135 basis points from
those lows. About 50 to 75 basis points of this advance has occurred
since April 6.
Other short-term credit markets. Despite continuing weak
demands for short-term market credit, short-term rates--with the exception
of those on Treasury bills which dropped somewhat this past week--have
moved up steadily over the past five weeks. Increases since the end of
March have ranged from 25 to 75 basis points. The largest increases
occurred in short-term commercial and finance company paper rates and
in rates on certificates of deposit.

III -28
At the end of March, seasonally adjusted commercial and
finance company paper outstanding totaled $31.0 billion, a decline of
$1.6 billion for the month and $2.6 billion for the quarter. Nonbank
related paper has fallen $1.9 billion since the end of 1970 and $1.4
billion in the past month.
The major share of the quarterly decline in nonbank paper was
in directly-placed finance company paper which dropped $1.6 billion.
This decline in outstandings is attributable to sluggish consumer
credit growth, bank competition in the auto loan field, and long-term
borrowings as well as to shifts by some finance companies to bank loans.
Since the loss of its Dun and Bradstreet prime rating,
Chrysler Financial Corporation, in particular, has had to refinance
sizeable reductions of its outstanding paper at commercial banks. On
April 16 Standard and Poor's began rating Chrysler Financial paper for
the first time and announced that its rating was favorable. In the
following week (the latest for which data are available), the further
run-off of Chrysler paper slowed but was not halted. The proceeds of
Chrysler Financial's recently announced $90 million long-term debenture,
by helping to restructure the firms liabilities, should help further
to bolster the company's credit rating.
The outstanding amount of non-bank dealer-placed commercial
paper, after increasing $2.8 billion between August 1970 and January
1971, leveled off in February 1971 and fell about $900 million in
March. As rates on commercial paper have moved up in recent weeks--from

III -29
an early March low ranging from 3-3/4--4-1/2 per cent for paper maturing
in 30-270 days, to the current 4-1/2--5 per cent range--this paper has
become a somewhat less attractive source of short-term funds vis-a-vis
commercial banks even after taking into account the recent increase in
the prime rate to 5-1/2 per cent at a number of leading banks.
(Commercial paper rates reflect investor yields; the cost to borrowers
is somewhat higher, perhaps as much as 1.0 per cent).

Federal finance. Estimates of unified Federal budget
receipts for FY 1971 have been revised downward by $0.9 billion
because of lower-than-anticipated corporate tax receipts this past
quarter, and a consequent downward revision in expected June payments.
The downward adjustments reflect largely a shortfall in payments on
1970 rather than on 1971 liabilities.

III -31
Estimates of Federal outlays have not been revised since the
last Greenbook, although April outlays do seem to be running at a
slightly lower level than was then projected. The shortfall in receipts
has thus increased the unified budget deficit expected by the staff
for FY 1971, from $20.0 billion to $20.9 billion.
No significant change has been made in the high employment
budget estimates for FY 1971 or for calendar year 1971 since the last
Greenbook, so that the near-balance in the high employment budget
continues.
Along with additional social security reform there is now a
possibility of increases in social security taxes starting in January,
1972. The House Ways and Means Committee has tentatively approved an
increase in the taxable wage base to $10,600 rather than to the $9,000
level recently enacted for January 1, 1972, plus rate increases starting
with an increase from 5.2 per cent to 5.4 per cent effective the same
date. If enacted, these measures would raise staff estimates of receipts
for both actual and high employment budgets for FY 1972. Most of the
effect of the wage base increase would not occur until the second half
of calendar 1972, however, and staff estimates already include a $9,000
taxable wage base level and make some allowance for the additional
expenditures that are involved in social security reform.

THE ECONOMIC PICTURE IN DETAIL
International Developments
Foreign Exchange Markets. Following the burst of
speculation against the dollar and in favor of a few European curren-
cies at the end of March and in the first two days of April, foreign
exchange markets have regained a calmer, though still nervous,
atmosphere. Net intervention purchases of spot dollars by the major
European central banks, which totaled $1.3 billion in the three days
March 31 -April 2, amounted to only $320 million in the subsequent
three weeks. The principal factor contributing to the more settled
market conditions appears to be the narrowing of the gap between
dollar interest rates and European national interest rates as the
former have risen (see Euro-dollar market) and the latter declined.
Despite the quieter tone of the market in recent weeks, however,
signs of uneasiness persist. Three-month forward rates for the Swiss
franc, the Dutch guilder, and the Belgian franc remain above the spot
ceiling rates for those currencies. The three-month mark rate moved
above the spot upper limit on April 28, following the Bundesbank's
withdrawal from the forward market.
Large-scale intervention in the forward market by the German
Bundesbank was a major factor in reducing the demand for spot German
marks and, consequently, in reducing the amount of spot dollar purchases
by the Federal Bank. The Bundesbank's outright purchases of dollars

IV -2
(sales of marks) three-months forward amounted to nearly $1-1/2 billion
from April 2 to April 28. From April 6 to April 27, the Bundesbank
did not intervene in the spot market at all as the spot DM stayed well
below its upper limit. In contrast, from March 31 to April 6, net spot
dollar purchases had amounted to $800 million. The combination of this
massive addition to the central bank's reserves in early April, and the
reduction of the Bundesbank's lending rates on March 31, led to a sharp
easing of money market conditions in Germany. The key call money rate,
which had been around 7-1/2 per cent in late March, fell steadily
to 4 per cent by mid April and to around 2 per cent by the 20th.
Three-month money over the same period declined from about 7-5/8 to
6-1/8. German banks, flush with excess reserves, may well have been
exporting funds to the Euro-dollar market during this period, selling
spot marks against dollars and selling forward dollars against marks.
The Bundesbank's sales of forward marks acted to depress forward mark
premiums, encouraging such covered outflows. On April 28, the
Bundesbank announced the cessation of its foward market operations with
the hope that its withdrawal from the forward market would not result
in the re-emergence of a heavy demand for spot marks. The spot rate
reacted by firming sharply, to very near the ceiling. (The Federal
Reserve Bank of New York, in co-operation with the Bundesbank, sold
$66 million equivalent of forward marks for System account in the
New York market in April. The System is covering its forward commitments

IV -3
to the market by drawing, for value in July, $60 million equivalent
on the swap line with the Bundesbank.)
Among other central banks of the EEC countries, exchange
market intervention was quite light after the first few days of
the month. The central banks of Italy and Belgium had modest reserve
gains, while neither the Bank of France nor the Netherlands Bank
purchased dollars. The Swiss National Bank purchased $220 million from
Swiss banks ahead of the long Easter weekend, but sold this amount
back to the banks when the markets re-opened.
The Bank of England purchased nearly $200 million during
the month as sterling firmed from its early April lows. The London
money market remained relatively tight, and on several days oil company
buying was reportedly significant.
Euro-dollar market. The declining trend in Euro-dollar rates
in the first quarter of this year was substantially reversed in April.
Call Euro-dollar deposits have been quoted over a wide range in
April but, on average, have firmed substantially from their March
average. In recent days call deposits have ranged from 4-7/8 to
5-7/8 per cent, compared to a Federal funds rate of about 4 per
cent. Three-month Euro-dollar deposit rates (now about 6 per cent)
have increased fairly steadily in April -- about in line with increases
in domestic CD rates, so that the excess of the three-month Euro-dollar
rates over domestic CD rates of comparable maturity has not changed
substantially in the course of the last several weeks.

The advances in Euro-dollar rates in April were no doubt
partly in response to the firming in U.S. money market rates over the
same period. These advances have occurred at a time when interest rates
in many of the major foreign national money markets have tended downward
(most notably in Germany) following discount rate reductions in
early April by several major European central banks. Aside from rising
interest rates in the United States, the Euro-dollar market was
perhaps substantially influenced by the emergence of speculative flows
of funds into the continental currencies in early April, as well as
reports (first widely circulated near the beginning of the month)

IV -5
to the effect that European central banks planned a concerted "squeeze"
on the Euro-dollar market -- allegedly through a withdrawal of official
deposits from that market.
Probably one of the most important influences on Euro-dollar
rates in recent weeks has been that the amount of funds employed in the
United State by the foreign branches of U.S. banks has stabilized
since mid-April at about $5-1/2 billion (including $3 billion of
foreign branch holdings of special Ex-Im securities and U.S. Treasury
certificates), following very substantial and virtually uninterrupted
declines from early January through the end of March.
On April 9 the foreign branches of U.S. banks made payment for
the $1.5 billion U.S. Treasury certificate offering, which carried an
interest rate of 5-3/8 per cent; on April 26 the first Ex-Im security
offering of $1 billion was refunded at 6 per cent. The banks' shares
in the refunding were based entirely on their share in the original
(January) offering and not related in any way to changes in the banks'
Euro-dollar positions since January.
In the computation period ended April 14 Euro-dollar borrowings
of U.S. banks plus Ex-Im and Treasury secutity holdings of their foreign
branches averaged about $0.75 billion less than in the preceding four
week period, compared to a decline of $0.9 billion the time before.
U.S. balance of payments. More complete reports
(strictly confidential) for March confirm that the deficits on both
conventional measures of the balance of payments were extremely large

IV -6
in the first quarter. The deficit on the liquidity basis was about
$3 billion, seasonally adjusted and before counting the second
annual SDR allocation. As U.S. banks made large repayments of their
Eurodollar borrowings, the deficit on the official settlement basis
was nearly double the liquidity deficit -- over $5-1/2 billion.
The deficits on both bases were very large in the first
week of April and continued to be sizable in the following two weeks.
Major European central banks had only small reserve gains after the
first week, though the German central bank purchased large amounts
of forward dollars. Liabilities to commercial banks abroad have changed
little on balance so far this month; the $1.5 billion issue of Treasury
notes to foreign branches of U.S. banks on April 9 was substituted for
claims on their U.S. head offices.
It is increasingly clear that the worsening of the liquidity
deficit in the first quarter resulted in large part from outflows of
U.S. funds attracted by higher interest rates abroad and influenced by
rumors regarding possible changes in foreign parities. The March
trade balance improved on the very low January-February results, so
that the merchandise export surplus increased a little from the
fourth to the first quarter, as described below. There were large
receipts from the reduction of U.S. bank-reported claims on foreigners
inthe first quarter, reversing the heavy outflow of the fourth quarter.
On the unfavorable side, net capital inflows from transactions in

IV -7
securities in the first quarter were about $250 million less than
in the closing quarter of 1970.

Foreign purchases of U.S. stocks were negative in February
and small in March. In the first quarter total net foreign purchases
of stocks were only $120 million, all in January; in the fourth quarter
of 1970 they had been nearly $500 million. Partially offsetting this
decline in foreign purchases of corporate stocks were larger foreign
purchases of Eurobonds issued by U.S. corporations. Since mid-March,
however, U.S. companies have had increasing difficulty in floating such
issues, and foreign investors are requiring a higher rate of return

IV -8
on dollar-denominated offerings than on non-dollar issues. This
cautiousness of foreign investors toward U.S. securities may reflect
uncertainties about exchange rates.
Data are not yet available on other transactions, but it
seems likely that outflows of U.S. corporate funds in the first
quarter were very high. Investment outlays of foreign affiliates
of U.S. firms are projected to increase 16 per cent in 1971 --
less than the extraordinarily large increase of 22 per cent in
1970, but still substantial. Interest rate and exchange rate
considerations may have tended to accelerate the outflows.
U.S. foreign trade. The export surplus in March increased
sharply over February, as exports rose 3-1/2 per cent while imports
were unchanged. In the first quarter, the balance was at an annual
rate of $1.2 billion, (balance of payments basis), moderately higher
than the $0.8 billion of the fourth quarter but still far below the
$3 billion rates recorded in each of the second and third quarters
of last year.
Exports in the first quarter were $44.2 billion, at an
annual rate (balance of payments basis) 5 per cent higher than in the
previous quarter and 3 per cent above the peak recorded in the third
quarter of 1970. All of the first quarter increase can be attributed
to further rises in exports of agricultural commodities, heavy shipments
of automotive equipment to Canada, and expanded deliveries of commercial

IV -9
aircraft. These gains were partially offset by declines in industrial
materials; machinery exports were unchanged.
The gain in agricultural exports resulted from higher
shipments of soybeans, cotton, and tobacco. Exports of grains
declined slightly from the very high levels of the fourth quarter,
perhaps a consequence of improved world supplies of feedgrains.
The increase in exports of automotive equipment to Canada
is associated with the recovery from the GM strike. Automotive
exports to other areas also rose considerably. The high rate of
deliveries of jumbo jets in the first quarter is not likely to be
sustained beyond May. Delivery schedules of the aircraft companies
suggest a much slower rate of delivery after that month.
Imports in the first quarter were at an annual rate of
$43.0 billion (balance of payments basis), 4 per cent higher than
in the fourth quarter of 1970. The increase in imports was concentrated
in automobiles, both from Canada and other areas, and in other non-food
consumer goods. Imports of capital goods and foods were unchanged,
while imports of industrial supplies declined slightly.
The increase in imports of automobiles and parts from Canada
matched the rise in exports of automotive equipment in the first quarter,
and was somewhat greater than would have been expected from the shortfall
in imports in the fourth quarter as a result of the GM strike. This
strong increase in autos from Canada (where 50 per cent of production
is in compacts) along with the increase in autos from other areas reflects

IV -10
the continuing popularity of compact cars. Imports of cars from Europe
and Japan in the first quarter were at an annual rate of 1-1/2 million
units, accounting for about 15 per cent of the total auto market.
Despite an increase in hedgebuying of foreign steel in the
first quarter, total imports of industrial supplies declined slightly.
There is as yet no evidence of hedgebuying of foreign copper, though
the labor contract in that industry expires in June. Despite some
increase in March, imports of petroleum were lower in the first quarter
than in the fourth quarter. The effects of liberalized quotas and
higher prices resulting from the new agreements with foreign oil
producers have not yet shown up in the import statistics.

The ratio of imports to GNP rose further to 4.22 per cent in
the first quarter. The increased share of imports in domestic consumption
was particularly evident in consumer goods. While total domestic
expenditures on consumer goods other than autos were essentially
unchanged from the fourth quarter, total imports of consumer goods --
including televisions sets, radios, furniture, clothing, footwear, and
tape recorders -- rose by over 5 per cent.

IV -12
Economic activity in major industrial countries. In recent
months renewed expansion of economic activity has occurred in Canada,
and the pace of growth of demand and output has picked up again in
Germany and France. In Italy, Japan, and the United Kingdom there are
no signs of an acceleration of economic advance. There has been
some relaxation of restrictive fiscal and monetary policies in most
countries in order to stimulate domestic demand. However, reflationary
policies are cautious, because prices and wages are continuing to
increase at rates considered to be excessive by the governments and
central banks. In Germany, no overt move toward less restrictive
monetary policies has been made. The April 1 discount rate reduction
was taken for external reasons, but short-term interest rates have
been permitted to decline significantly. The massive inflow of short-
term capital during March and the first days of April caused a marked
easing in German financial markets.
The near-term outlook is for slow expansion, proceeding
from a high base. The main stimulus in most countries is expected
to come from the expansion of private consumption, while residential
construction and government spending also will provide some strength
to aggregate demand. Owing to low profit margins and conditions of
excess capacity, private investment demand is expected to advance
more slowly in 1971 than last year.
Recent data in Germany indicate renewed expansion of
industrial activity. Industrial production advanced sharply in January

IV -13
and remained in February at the high January level. The steep January
increase was chiefly due to an advance in output of machinery and
equipment. In February, materials output rose considerably faster
than earlier, offsetting declines in capital and consumer goods production,
suggesting a termination of the period during which inventory
accumulation was being held down.
New orders data (revised) show a sharp January increase
above the high November-December level, and maintenance in February
of the January level. Foreign orders, particularly for capital goods,
recorded a large increase in January, hut fell back to their December
level in February. Order backlogs, no longer shrinking as rapidly
as they had during most of 1970, were equal in January to almost
4 months of production for industry as a whole.

The restoration of accelerated depreciation alloances and
the lowering of the investment tax in January had an important influence
on new orders for machinery and equipment even before the end of 1970.
The January-February rate of output in this sector is unlikely to be
sustainable.
The substantial increases in disposable incomes over the past
three years still are contributing to advances in private consumption.
The scheduled ending of the 10 per cent personal income tax surcharge
this June 30 should provide a spur for continuing strong consumer
demand. Domestic bank credit continues to be tight and expensive,
and cost pressures have lowered profit margins and reduced retained
earnings. This will affect the pace of private investment expenditures.
No stimulus to aggregate demand from government expenditures will be
forthcoming in the months ahead. In March, mandatory ceilings were
put on federal government outlays, and the Lander and municipalities
were asked to limit their expenditures on a voluntary basis.
Industrial production in the United Kingdom increased by
1 per cent from the third to the fourth quarter last year, sparked by
substantial inventory accumulation. That rate of advance has probably
not been sustained this year. Owing to the postal strike, virtually
no data on real output or expenditures since the end of 1970 are
available, but unemployment and job vacancy statistics suggest a new
slowing of activity. The number of jobless has been rising steadily
since the beginning of 1970, with a brief pause last autumn. In the

IV -15
six months to April the increase amounted to 22 per cent. The April
unemployment rate of 3.1 per cent of the labor force is extremely
high by British standards, and reflects spreading efforts by employers
to hold down costs.
With aggregate output not advancing, unemployment high and
rising, and manufacturing investment lagging, the Chancellor's 1971-
72 budget called for some reflationary action. However, since price
and wage increases continue very large, the government's goal is
limited to stimulate growth of total output at a rate of 3 per cent
per annum. This is calculated to be sufficient to check the rise
in unemployment by mid-year, though inadequate to lower it.
The offical government forecast indicates that expansion
is expected to be consumption-led, with real consumer spending rising
by 5.3 per cent from the first half of 1971 to the first half of 1972.
Other major components of aggregate demand are expected to advance
much less, and total output is projected to rise by 3.1 per cent.
Industrial production in France in the three months December-
February was about 2 per cent above the previous three months' level.
Consumer expenditures, stimulated by a substantial relaxation
of installment purchase terms last autumn, led the advance. Consumer
goods inventories are being worked down, and the buildup of new
orders should provide a stimulus to output in the months ahead.
Demands for exports and domestic demand for intermediate
goods and, to some extent, capital goods have been relatively soft,

IV -16
particularly compared to last year. The decline in new orders for
intermediate goods that started in the latter part of 1970 appears
to have ceased in March, but activity in this sector remains subdued.
Unemployment rose throughout 1970, and more rapidly towards
the end of the year. The recent large rise in industrial output was
achieved with no increase in employment. Should unemployment continue
to climb, pressure will mount on the government to raise its.public
works outlays. But as prices are continuing to rise, the authorities
may proceed cautiously with expansionary budgetary measures. The
monetary policy stance is likely to remain moderately expansive.
The Italian economy is still being seriously hurt by labor
unrest. Industrial production in January-February reportedly was
no higher than last September, and thus continued to be well below
potential.
Late in 1970 the rate of rise in aggregate demand slowed,
and so far in 1971 there evidently has been no pick-up. The pace
of spending for plant and equipment has tapered off over the past
year, because the troubled labor scene has been eroding business
confidence and because the margin of unused industrial capacity has
been growing. A levelling of exports since the third quarter of
last year also has contributed to the weakened expansion of total
output.
In early April, the Bank of Italy reduced its discount rate
by one-half percentage point to 5 per cent. The Budget Minister has

IV -17
indicated that he is considering fiscal measures to increase total
investment.
The pace of economic expansion in Japan has eased significantly.
Industrial production this February was at about the same level as in
mid-1970.
A marked deceleration in private plant and equipment outlays
and a reduction in the rate of inventory accumulation have contributed
to the slowing of Japanese expansion. Export expansion has remained
strong and public works spending is rising.
Since last July, there has been a moderate decline in the
rate of plant capacity utilization and there has been a slight decrease
in employment in certain manufacturing industries. New orders for machinery
and equipment, which have been weak since last autumn, declined in February.
The government and the Bank of Japan are counting on stronger
private consumption demand, a resumption of more normal rates of inven-
tory accumulation, and a rise in construction to spark a revival in ex-
pansion. Monetary conditions have eased, and a further small reduction
in the Bank of Japan's discount rate is expected soon. The government
also plans to spend 70 per cent of the budgeted public works outlays
in the first half (April-September) of the current fiscal year.
The decline in economic activity in Canada bottomed out in
the third quarter of 1970. The revival in activity, interrupted some-
what by the auto strike in the final quarter of 1970 and a severe
winter, has been moderate, spurred principally by the expansion of

IV -18
consumer and government expenditures and by a buoyant housing sector.
Industrial production in the three months ending February was 1.5 per
cent above the rate of the previous three months.
Unemployment, which peaked at 6.8 per cent of the labor
force in September, declined to 6 per cent in March. Some of this
apparent improvement resulted from a withdrawal of job seekers from
the labor market.
In manufacturing, deliveries advanced by 4 per cent in
February. New orders rose by 4.5 per cent in February, extending the
improving trend evident since December, and widening the order backlog.
The strengthening of new orders, however, is confined largely to the
durable goods sector, which was affected by a resumption of production
following the automobile strike.
Consumer demand has revived, and public sector investment also
is providing strength to aggregate demand. Although total investment,
including housing, according to the latest government survey is expected
to advance by 8 per cent this year, no increase in manufacturing invest-
ment is planned.
The government has relaxed its tight monetary policies and
has gradually increased its spending and lending programs. The recent
rise in prices, however -- following only moderate price increases last
year -- is reviving fears of a new round of inflation, and may inhibit
the government from pursuing more expansionary policies despite the
relatively high rates of unemployment.
