SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK
Nonfinancial
The staff continues to expect real GNP in the second quarter
to increase at an annual rate of around 3 per cent, less than half the
rise in the first quarter and below the trend rise in potential GN.
Residential construction activity is still moving up strongly; housing
starts increased somewhat further in May from an already advanced level
and building permits rose sharply. Inventory investment is apparently
up from the very low first quarter rate. But no new expansive thrust
has emerged in other sectors. The labor market remains sluggish. Initial
unemployment claims have turned up in recent weeks and insured unemploy-
ment has continued to rise.
A sizable and widespread increase in industrial production in
May may be followed by a smaller rise in June. Auto assemblies in June
are scheduled at the May rate and raw steel output is declining somewhat
more than seasonally, with stocks large and steel consumers apparently
downgrading chances of a prolonged strike. For the second quarter as
a whole, industrial production is estimated to be up at an annual rate
of about 4 per cent.
A strengthening of retail sales in March and April was followed
by declines in May and apparently in the first half of June. For the
quarter as a whole, however, the increase from the first quarter average
is likely to be appreciable. Unit sales of domestic autos were down
sharply in the first 10 days of June, reflecting mainly the ending of
sales incentive contests.

I- 2
Total new orders for durable goods and for the capital equipment
category rose in May, but both remained below the levels of the first
quarter. Book values of manufacturers' and trade inventories increased
appreciably in April, as in March; the bulk of the April rise was in lines
other than autos and steel, in contrast to the pattern of earlier months
this year.
Consumer prices rose sharply in May following a marked slowing
in the first four months of the year. The rise in food prices slowed,
but there were widespread increases in prices of other goods and services.
A much smaller decline in mortgage interest rates also provided less of
an offset than in earlier months this year.
Outlook. The staff projection of an increase of $20 billion
in current dollar GNP this quarter is virtually unchanged from the
projection of three weeks ago. Except for a slight upward revision in
business fixed investment, the major demand sectors also have not been
changed.
A number of modifications, however, have been introduced into
the staff projections for the second half of the year. We no longer
assume a steel strike, which reduces somewhat the earlier disparity
between GNP expansion in the third and fourth quarters. The working
off of steel stocks will be more prolonged--probably extending at least
through year-end--than if a strike occurs. A second modification, serving

I-3
to raise GNP expansion in the third quarter, reflects the larger military
pay package passed by the Senate. A secondary effect of the larger in-
crease in military pay is an expected larger increase in consumer spending.
The increase in current dollar GNP is now expected to average
close to $22 billion in the last two quarters, virtually unchanged on
balance from our previous projection. But recent and prospective wage
and price developments suggest that our earlier expectations as to the
GNP price deflator have been too optimistic. Consequently, we have
raised our projections--the fourth quarter increase, at an annual rate
of about 4-1/2 per cent, represents only a little slowing in the pace
of inflation, and compares with about 4 per cent in our last projection.
Real GNP is now projected to rise at an annual rate of only
3-1/4 per cent over the last two quarters. The unemployment rate is
expected to edge up to about 6.5 per cent in the fourth quarter and
capacity use in manufacturing to change little from the low rate pre-
vailing currently.
Financial
While interest rates have risen on balance since the last
Committee meeting, most recently yields on Treasury coupon issues and
corporate bonds have receded from their highs for the month. A stronger
demand for corporate bonds developed at mid-month as the forward calendar
suggested some tapering of new issue volume. This does not seem to re-
flect a shift of financing to other markets since the business sector's
demand remained small in both the commercial paper market and at banks.

I- 4
Following the May increase, business loan expansion at banks in June
has apparently been modest at best, and major banks have not, at this
writing, followed First Pennsylvania Bank in raising the prime rate.
Yields on longer-term tax-exempt bonds remained under upward
pressure as banks continued to emphasize acquisitions of shorter-term
issues. Other investors in State and local securities also tended to
reduce their purchases in anticipation of higher yields. Yields on
home mortgages in the secondary market leveled off in early June, follow-
ing a sharp May run-up, as many market participants continued to be con-
cerned about the future availability of funds; and rates on conventional
mortgages rose in May for the first time in nearly a year.
Outlook. Assuming continuation of the recent higher Federal
funds rate, the expected relatively large volume of new securities issues--
including a much more than seasonal $11 billion demand for funds by the
Treasury between the end of June and mid-August--may well constrain the
size of the latest recovery in corporate and Treasury bond prices, and
could possibly generate some further weakening in the tax-exempt market
in coming weeks.
The outlook for a change in the prime rate is uncertain.
Current loan demands do not appear large, and the staff expects such
demands to remain weak to moderate into the summer. Banks neverthe-
less might move the prime rate in closer alignment with other short-
term rates, as was the case in April. A rise in the prime rate has largely
been discounted by the market, although a general move to 6 per cent,

I-5
rather than 5-3/4 per cent, might lead to some further upward adjust-
ment in market rates.
The mid-year reinvestment period for banks and other thrift
institutions is being viewed with caution by some lenders. The current
AT&T preferred stock offering, in particular, represents an attractive
investment alternative for savers. More generally, however, rate re-
lationships do not suggest a high rate of withdrawal during the rein-
vestment period. But the rate of savings inflows to thrift institu-
tions over the summer, while expected to remain fairly large by histor-
ical standards, will probably decline somewhat further.
Mortgage markets should receive support, however, from the
continued high level of institutional liquidity and the Home Loan Banks'
announced intention to provide assistance to S&L's in maintaining mort-
gage credit flows. Nevertheless, the expected slowing of savings in-
flows this summer could contribute to a further increase in the contract
rate on conventional mortgages. And the continued large discount on
government insured mortgages has increased the probability of HUD action
to lift the FHA/VA ceiling rate.
Balance of payments
Revised data for net exports of goods and services in the first
quarter indicate a somewhat larger surplus than the Commerce Department
had previously estimated. The difference is due, however, mainly to
temporary factors affecting deliveries on military sales contracts and
to a decline in interest payments. The merchandise trade position

I -6
continues to be very unsatisfactory; preliminary indications are that
in May imports may have continued to exceed exports of nonmilitary goods,
as they did in April.
Data for the over-all balance of payments in the first quarter
of 1971 (confidential until published next week) show, as had been ex-
pected, a relatively large outflow of U. S. corporate capital and very
large unaccounted transactions ("errors and omissions"). Differences
between interest rates here and abroad were wide and increasing until
mid-March, and before the end of the quarter expectations were beginning
to develop of an appreciation of the German mark and perhaps other
currencies.
After the flood of funds into marks and other currencies at
the end of April and in early May, the Bundesbank stayed out of the
exchange market from May 5 to June 1. Since then it has been buying
marks (selling dollars) at exchange rates that moved up gradually to
a level about 4-1/2 per cent above par (and rose somewhat higher this
week). The Bundesbank's spot sales of dollars have exceeded its intake
through maturing forward contracts. Although Japan has continued to gain
reserves rapidly, the central banks of the major industrial countries in
the aggregate have apparently had a small decline in their total reserves
since mid-May. This corresponds to the fact that the U. S. official
settlements deficit has been small in that period.
The U. S. deficit on the liquidity basis has continued large,
according to incomplete preliminary indicators which show considerable
variation from week to week. In addition to the underlying deficit on

I -7
current and long-term capital transactions, a movement by means of
commercial leads and lags into the Japanese yen may be taking place.
Also, net outflows to Europe of short-term funds of nonbank businesses
and individuals may be continuing in response to the existing differ-
ences in interest rates, particularly in relation to the Euro-dollar
market. Interest rates in most of the major national markets abroad
are lower now than they were in March, and there has been a considerable
rise in U. S. rates. This rise in U. S. rates was accompanied, however,
by an even larger rise in Euro-dollar rates during and after the run into
marks. After receding from their peaks, Euro-dollar deposits of 1 month
to a year now carry interest rates in the 6-3/4 to 7-1/2 per cent range.
While the Euro-dollar market may thus still be attracting funds
of businesses and individuals, the reflux from the German mark has
produced relatively easy conditions at the very short end of that
market. In the past two weeks the interest rate on overnight Euro-
dollars has averaged well below 5 per cent. This has been a factor
in an increase in recent days in U. S. banks' outstanding borrowings
from their foreign branches. The long-continued run-off in the banks'
liabilities to branches stopped earlier this month and there had already
been some increases, possibly reflecting an attitude of caution with
regard to maintaining sizable liquid asset positions (including claims
on head offices) at the branches. With the reversal of the run-off in
liabilities to branches, the official settlements balance has shown more
favorable results than the liquidity balance in recent weeks.

I-8
We may see some tightening in the Euro-dollar market as the OFDI
quarter-end reporting date approaches, bringing repatriations of U. S.
corporation funds. Further ahead, there will be a period of uncertain
length during which the reflux from the German mark will continue, with
benefit to the U. S. official settlements balance if flows to other
countries through the Euro-dollar market or directly from Germany or
the United States are not too large. (How the net flow will be affected
in July by the maturing of a large volume of DM forward contracts that
month is uncertain.)
Within Germany, a net outflow from the mark will enable the
authorities to squeeze the liquid asset position of the banking system,
in their effort to cool off the economy and check the continuing infla-
tion of prices and costs. Eventually, there may be favorable repercus-
sions for the U. S. balance of payments both from the appreciation of
the German mark and from a possible decline in German interest rates.
In the more immediate future, however, the efforts to restrain the
growth of demand in Germany will have to be counted as an adverse
factor, tending to hold down U. S. net exports.

THE ECONOMIC PICTURE IN DETAIL
Domestic Nonfinancial Scene
Gross national product. The economic situation appears to
be developing this quarter about as we had expected, a modest rate of
economic growth is occurring, fueled mainly by strength in residential
construction activity and some expansion in non-auto retail sales.
Steel stock-piling also has been a factor contributing to overall
inventory accumulation, although less so than expected earlier.
Moreover, the incoming economic news does not suggest any
major change in the underlying outlook for the remainder of the year.
We continue to anticipate relatively moderate gains in output in the
second half, and our GNP projection for the year as a whole remains
only a little above the $1050 billion level.
A more satisfactory rate of economic growth now appears
likely in the first half of next year, however, sparked by a rise
in the minimum wage, increases in Federal pay, and a rise in social
security benefits. The beginnings of a rebound in business fixed
capital outlays and a more rapid rate of inventory investment also
appear probable after the turn of the year. As will be detailed in
the staff presentation on Tuesday, we now anticipate first half 1972
increases in current dollar GNP averaging over $25 billion per quarter
and real growth to recover to about a 5 per cent annual rate.

II -2
Our projection of GNP increase for the second quarter of
this year remains about $20 billion--only two-thirds the rise of the
preceding quarter, when the rise was temporarily inflated by the
post-strike rebound in auto sales. In real terms, growth of GNP in
the second quarter is projected at slightly over 3 per cent, annual
rate.

Housing starts through May are consistent with an annual
rate for the quarter in excess of 1.9 million units, indicating a
further strong rise in residential construction activity, although
by about $1 billion less than in the first quarter. Recent ship-
ments data suggest a slightly larger increase in capital expenditures

II -3
than we had projected last time. Our projections continue to indicate
smaller increases in the second quarter than the first for State and
local spending and declines in net exports and in Federal purchases.
The projection of the rise in personal consumption expenditures
for the quarter remains approximately as it was in the preceding
Greenbook. Revised figures indicate a somewhat larger increase in
retail sales than had been indicated earlier for March and April,
but sales dropped back in May and were sluggish in early June. Although
total unit auto sales have been averaging a respectable annual rate
of close to 10 million so far this year, sales of domestic-type models
have shown no tendency to climb above the 8.4 million rate of the
first quarter.
On the other hand, the expected signs of a moderate pickup
of inventory investment have been evident, following the first quarter
adjustment. Inventory accumulation in the first quarter reflected
stockpiling of steel and rebuilding of auto stocks; in other sectors,
inventories were run down slightly on balance. This situation began
to change toward the end of last quarter, and in April the book values
outside of autos and steel rose appreciably.

The outlook for GNP growth in the second half of the year
also remains about unchanged overall from the preceding Greenbook--
with expected gains averaging over $20 billion a quarter. However,
the quarterly pattern has been changed, and we have raised the third
quarter increase by $2-1/2 billion. We are now assuming enactment
shortly of a military pay increase amounting to $2.7 billion, about
$1 billion larger than we had formerly estimated, and this should
also increase consumption. Moreover, we believe that the odds have
shifted against the likelihood of a steel strike, and have not allowed
for one in the current projection. Industry acceptance of something

II -5
close to the settlements negotiated in the can and aluminum industries
would likely result in a somewhat smaller decline in inventory invest-
ment in the third quarter than we had projected earlier. In the
absence of an August-September strike, however, the fourth quarter
GNP increase is expected to be some $2 billion smaller than we had
projected a month ago--primarily because excess steel stocks would
continue to be drawn down throughout the quarter.
Although GNP growth for the two quarters combined is about
the same as in the preceding projection, we have again raised our
estimate of the probable rise in the price deflator, and gains in
GNP for the period reflect more price and less real increase. Because
of recent price increases, and the outlook for continued large wage
settlements, we now expect only a little easing of inflationary
pressures. The rate of increase in the deflator in the fourth
quarter is projected at a 4-1/2 per cent annual rate, rather than the
4 per cent indicated in the preceding Greenbook. Projected real GNP
growth, therefore, has been reduced somewhat, averaging 3-1/4 per cent
over the second half, and some further increase in unemployment seems
in prospect. We expect that the pace of real GNP growth will accelerate
in early 1972, however, and the unemployment rate should begin to decline
from the 6-1/2 per cent rate we now anticipate for late this year.

Industrial production. The May increase in industrial
production was widespread, with the largest advances in autos and
steel. However, if the slight rise in output of business equipment
is not just a one month "up tick," it could be the most significant
production change in May.

Industrial production is anticipated to have increased further
in June but not by as much as in May. June auto production schedules
are set at the May rate. Output of raw steel is being cut back more
than usual in June and steel mill finishing operations will probably be
at or below the May level. Coal production has been reduced by strikes
and Texas "allowable" crude oil extraction was curtailed further in June.

II -9
Also, there is lack of expansion in output of appliances, television
sets, apparel, and nonferrous metals. But increases are expected in
production of consumer staples, furniture, textiles and some other
materials.
Retail sales. Retail sales declined 0.8 per cent from April
to May, according to the advance report, following two months of sub-
stantial increase. Durable goods sales were down 2.9 per cent, with
the automotive group off 4.0 per cent and the furniture and appliance
group declining 2.9 per cent. Nondurable goods sales as a whole were
virtually unchanged from April, as increases in food and apparel off-
set small declines in general merchandise and various smaller categories.
Compared with a year earlier, May sales were up 6.0 per cent.
Sales in March and April were revised upward by more complete
sample counts and now appear as the strongest months, compared with a
year earlier, since early 1969. The largest increases from a year
earlier were shown by the automotive and general merchandise groups.

Unit auto sales. Sales of new domestic-type autos in the
first 10 days of June were at an annual rate of 7.4 million units,
12 per cent below the 8.4 million rate prevailing in the first five
months of the year. The decline was concentrated at GM dealers and
reflected the ending of a sales incentive contest in May.
Inventories. Book value of manufacturing and trade inventories
rose at an $8.6 billion annual rate in April, according to preliminary
data--only a little less than the upward-revised March rate of $10.3
billion. Sales also rose in April, and inventory-sales ratios were
little changed from the reduced March levels.

The industrial composition of inventory accumulation has
changed markedly in recent months. In the first quarter, the only
upward impetus to inventories was in the auto-and steel-related
sectors; in April, however, more than half of the increase occurred
outside of autos and steel.

In May, dealers' stocks of new domestic-make cars rose.
Unit sales of these cars also increased and the dealers' stock-sales
ratio for new domestic autos declined slightly. However, this ratio
was above year-earlier levels in both April and May, and at 58 days'
supply, seasonally adjusted, was approaching the level of autumn 1969.
When surveyed in May, manufacturers anticipated adding to
their inventories at a $2.4 billion annual rate during the current
quarter, somewhat higher than the $1.5 billion rate actually reported
by manufacturers in preliminary April data. Manufacturers expected to
add to stocks at a $3.6 billion rate in the third quarter, but such
"first anticipations" are subject to considerable error. There was a
decline in the reported amount of inventory excess to $2.13 billion,
the lowest figure since June 1969. Sales were projected to increase
2 per cent in the second quarter and 3 per cent in the third.
Manufacturers' orders and shipments. New orders for durable
goods rose 1.9 per cent in May, according to the advance report, after
declining 3.6 per cent in April. The May level remains below the first
quarter average. Shipments also rose in May and the unfilled order
backlog was down 1.3 per cent, the third straight month of decline
for this series.

Orders rose for defense products and capital equipment, but
both remain below the first quarter rate; also, backlogs fell for
both groups. Iron and steel orders fell further in May, but this drop
was offset by increases for other primary metals manufacturers. "All
other" durable goods,which include construction materials and miscellaneous
producer and consumer goods and materials, rose in May and were above
the first quarter average.
Cyclical indicators. The preliminary Census composite
index of leading indicators rose 0.6 per cent in May, the seventh
straight month of increase. The coincident composite rose for the
sixth month in a row, and the lagging composite for the third month
in a row.

NOTE: April leading composite still preliminary -net business

The lagging composites for December through April were

of business loan rates and of actual instead of anticipated plant
and equipment spending for the first quarter.
The National Bureau of Economic Research, in a paper by
Solomon Fabricant published last month, has expressed the judgment
that in 1969 and 1970 the U.S. economy experienced a " 'classical'
contraction, that is, a contraction of the same general type as those
listed in the National Bureau's business-cycle chronology." November
1969 is chosen as the "tentative" peak date. Fabricant judges that
the contraction continued to November 1970 but that is too early to
tell whether it troughed then or not.

II -15
Based on relationships from previous postwar cycles, the
leading indicator composite had "predicted" that the recession would
be at least as severe as the 1960-61 downturn, but as measured by the
coincident composite, it was less severe. Since November, the leading
composite has increased slightly more than in the six months following
February 1961 but less than in the other comparable recovery periods.
The recovery through May in the coincident composite, however, was
weaker than six-month rates of recovery from any of the four previous
troughs, although it included the recovery from the GM strike.
A coincidence of strike and cycle troughs would not be
unprecedented: the Bureau's October 1949 trough coincided with a
steel strike. In that case it has been argued by some that the real
trough came earlier. In the recent case, it has been similarly argued
by some that the recovery began in mid-1970 but was interrupted by the
strike, but a case could also be made that the trough in the rest of
the economy came later, say in February 1971. The recovery in the
coincident composite is equally unimpressive measured from that date,
though the number of months since then for which we have data is
insufficient for making a good comparison.
Residential construction and real estate. Seasonally adjusted
private housing starts turned upward again in May to an annual rate of
1,931,000. Except for March, when the multifamily component of starts
reached a record rate, the over-all pace in May was the highest so far
this year. Single-family starts also edged higher to maintain the
improved relative share--57 per cent--of total starts regained in April.

II -16
With commitments and builder permits both at new peaks this
spring--permits were up 14 per cent further in May--some further
expansion in starts is indicated for June, possibly to or above the
2 million unit rate. Such a rate would carry the average for the
second quarter as a whole to an annual rate of 1.95 million units, or
more than 50 per cent above the cyclical low in the first quarter of
last year. Assuming mobile home shipments hold near the record
478,000 annual rate reported for April, the combined rate of new shelter-
units for the second quarter could exceed the previous historic high
reached in the first quarter of this year by as much as 200,000 units.

Demands for both used and new homes were exceptionally strong
in April, the latest month for which data are available. In the case
of single-family homes offered by speculative builders--who in recent
years have accounted for up to six-tenths of total single-family starts--
the annual rate of sales was second only to the record 662,000 reached
in March and nearly half again as high as a year earlier. While the
number of homes available for sale by such builders rose somewhat, it
was only slightly higher than in 1970. Reflecting in part some upgrading
in demands, moreover, the composition of such stocks was more closely
in line with market requirements, as indicated by the narrowing spread
between the median prices of homes sold and homes for sale shown in
the table. Altogether, the median price of homes sold in April was
back up nearly to the median price in 1969.

Labor market. The labor market has continued slack in
recent weeks. Initial claims for unemployment benefits have been
rising in recent weeks and total insured unemployment has continued
to edge up from its post-auto strike low in January.

The outlook is for some added pressure on unemployment from
the supply side. About 4 million persons from 16 to 24 years of age
are expected to be added to the civilian labor force between April
and July this year--about 150,000 more than last year. The increase
over the summer in the 20-24 year group is expected to be double that
of years as recent as 1966. With demands for labor still slack, a
further rise in unemployment among young job seekers seems likely this
summer and fall.

Personal income. Total personal income rose by $6 billion
in May. The annual rate of increase of about 8.5 per cent was close
to the average so far this year. Total wages and salaries rose by
over $4 billion compared to a $2.7 billion increase in April. A
pick-up in nonfarm employment--primarily in retail trade and manufacturing--
and an increase in the manufacturing workweek mainly accounted for the
larger May increase, although average employee earnings also continued
to rise rapidly. Transfer payments were up $1 billion and small gains
occurred in interest, dividends and rental income.

Wages and collective bargaining. Wage increases continue
large. Hourly earnings of production workers in the private nonfarm
sector were up 6.3 per cent over the year ending in May 1971. This
is about the same year-over-year increase as reported in earlier months
of 1971, and for 1970 as a whole. Collective bargaining agreements
concluded in late 1970 have resulted in accelerated earnings increases
in the manufacturing and transportation and public utilities industries.
In manufacturing, the largest increases have occurred in the automobile
industry. In transportation, increases have been large in both the
railroads and trucking.

An affirmative strike vote has been taken among the telephone
industry workers (the strike deadline is mid-July). Negotiations in
the steel industry are under way, but have not yet started on national
issues. Following the lead of recent aluminum and can settlements, the
telephone and steel contracts are currently eXpected to provide first

year wage increases of at least 10 per cent, with second and third year
boosts of 3 to 4 per cent to be supplemented by an open-ended cost-of-
living adjustment clause. Contracts for coal miners and East coast
longshoremen will expire September 30, 1971.
Consumer prices. Consumer prices rose at a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 6.9 per cent in May, the sharpest increase
in over a year. Acceleration of the rise reflected a rebound in
service costs and a sharp increase in non-food commodity prices. The
increase in food prices, seasonally adjusted, was modest, especially
when compared to experience earlier this year. The decline in mortgage
costs was much smaller than over the preceding few months, and the
effect on the all-items index was much less than in April or in the
first quarter, as may be observed from the table (which shows figures
that are not seasonally adjusted).

The rise in apparel prices accelerated in April, with a
particularly large increase for women and girls clothing, which is
reported to be selling well this season. Gasoline prices also rose
after declining for three months, and were below those of a year
earlier.
A major influence on the durable goods group in May was
the third consecutive large increase in used car prices, a series
that introduces a great deal of distortion in monthly price movements.
Also, prices of new and used homes rose substantially after changing
little in the period January through April. New cars and household
durables rose at relatively moderate rates.

Food prices rose much less in May than in April or in the
first quarter; meat prices edged off as declines for beef and pork
were mostly offset by increases for poultry and fish. Fresh fruit
and vegetable prices declined more than seasonally. Only moderate
increases in food prices are expected in the next few months.
Charges for services increased at an annual rate of almost
7 per cent in May, far above the rates earlier this year. The sharp
rise in postal rates accounted for about one-fourth of the increase
in the service category. Home finance costs rose substantially as
increases in property taxes far outweighted the more moderate drop
in mortgage rates. But the rise in other service costs was smaller
on average than in preceding months.

THE ECONOMIC PICTURE IN DETAIL
Domestic Financial Situation
Flow of Funds, Second Quarter. Based on preliminary estimates
and partial projections, total credit flows appear to have surged
upward in the second quarter to a $140 billion seasonally adjusted
annual rate. The $36 billion increase from the first quarter was
virtually all a resumption of Treasury borrowing, however, and reflected
mainly the Government's efforts to restore its cash balances after the
severe runoffs of cash in the first quarter. Other borrowing continued
at the high rates of the first quarter relative to investment outlays
and other financing requirements. Total credit flows over the half-year
were 11.8 per cent of GNP, higher than the peak rate for any full year
that was reached in 1968. Given these estimated flows, total debt
outstanding was growing during the first half of 1971 at a 7.9 per cent
annual rate, well below the 10 per cent rate of increase for GNP over
the same period.

III -3
Second-quarter private borrowing has been mainly long term,
in the pattern that was set late last year. Municipal borrowing--both
short term and long term--appears to be tapering off, after allowance
for seasonals, from the very high rates that began in December. While
public construction is higher this year than last, the first-quarter
rate of state and local government net issues was well beyond current
financing requirements, and some reduction in offerings was to be expected.
On an NIA basis, State and local government budgets are esti-
mated to be in balance this year even with the higher construction out-
lays. Including allowances for employee retirement funding and other
financial needs, however, these governments appear to have a credit
requirement for the year of about $12 billion. With borrowing during
the first six months at a $21 billion rate, some governments have clearly
made sizable additions to liquidity holdings.
Corporate business net borrowing in the second quarter has
been almost entirely in bonds, mortgages, and equity offerings. This
is a continuation of the first-quarter structure of flows, and, with
short-term debt almost static in amount outstanding, the security offer-
ings have been sufficient to cover all investment requirements and to
provide for a more than ample rate of growth in liquid assets. Liquidity
ratios to short-term debt have been restored to roughly 1966 year-end
levels of about 30 per cent, well up from the 26 per cent trough at the
end of 1969. With the improvement in these ratios, long-term financing
is losing the urgency it has had for business recently, and the volume
of offerings will probably become more sensitive to movements in market
rates.

II -4
For residential mortgages, the principal sources of increased
flows in the second quarter were savings and loan associations and a
resumption of net buying by FNMA. First-quarter flows were low relative
to estimated construction outlays, and the sharp rise in the second
quarter is in part a compensation for that. For the half-year, mortgage
flows were somewhat high relative to construction, suggesting that
existing house financing had increased from last year.

On the supply side of credit markets, private investors were
evidently still liquidating Governments on a net basis in the second
quarter, although by much smaller amounts than in the first quarter.
Even with the increase in Treasury issues, Federal Reserve and foreign
supply of funds appear to have provided most of the net Treasury re-
quirement. Sponsored-agency borrowing was dominated in both the first
and second quarter by retirements of home loan bank debt that had been
financing credit to thrift institutions.

The municipal and corporate bond markets apparently had about
the same structure of supply as in the first quarter. The second-quarter
decrease in municipal borrowing was matched roughly by a drop in
commercial bank buying, but banks continued to be the dominant source of
funds to this market. In corporate bond markets, mutual savings banks
have continued to buy at their high first-quarter rates, providing a
major support to this market. Corporate bonds have been a rising component
of savings bank portfolios since 1967, growing from 5 per cent of total
assets in 1966 to about 14 per cent currently. About half of the rise
has been offset by a drop in Government securities as a per cent of
assets and the other half by a decrease in the mortgage component. This
shift to bonds is related to the favorable yield on bonds relative to
mortgages and can be expected to continue unless mortgage yield spreads
rise again. The household sector continued to absorb bonds at the very
high rates that began in 1970.
In the total structure of credit supply (table 3), the rise
in Treasury borrowing from first to second quarter is matched mainly by
the halt of security liquidation by private domestic nonfinancial in-
vestors (line 10). For these investors, the first-quarter liquidation
had been offset by an enormous inflow of deposit money to institutions
(line 15), and in the second quarter the rate of these deposit flows
receded $40 billion, which was again the principal offset to security
market developments. The second quarter drop in private domestic deposit
flow--to a rate that was still as high as in the summer of 1970--was
at both banks and savings institutions, but it was not reflected in
the lending activities of these institutions. At banks, the first-

III -7
quarter inflow had been countered to some extent by reduction of Euro-
dollar borrowings (in line 16) and by the drop in Treasury balances (line
17), and in the second quarter the changes in these other sources of funds
fully offset the change in private deposit flow. At savings institutions,
the decreased deposit inflow in the second quarter was more than matched
by reductions in liquidity and did not impede a 30 per cent increase in
net mortgage lending at savings and loan associations.

Bank credit. Large banks continued to acquire securities in
significant volume in the early weeks of June but their loan expansion
moderated; in May, loans had accounted for a major share of the growth
in total credit at large banks (as well as at all commercial banks). As
in April and May, almost all of the securities acquired were tax-exempt
obligations and, with interest rates apparently expected to rise further,
banks continued to emphasize short-term maturities.
Business loan growth had accounted for a major share of the
increase in total loans in May but the partial data for weekly reporting
banks suggest that business loan expansion at all banks in June will be
significantly below the strong May pace. Such loans declined contra-
seasonally in the first two weeks of the month, as shown in the first
line of the table. However, business borrowing did pick up over the mid-
month tax date at large New York and Chicago banks (the only institutions
for which that week's data are available at this writing) and about
equalled the average rate of the corresponding week in other recent years.
Even with that, however, an unusually rapid growth in such loans would
be required over the balance of June to produce a more than modest
seasonally adjusted increase in business loans for the month.

Tax borrowing at mid-month appears to have been relatively
larger than over the March and April tax dates, even though corporate
tax liabilities were at their lowest level for June since 1965.1/ The
satisfaction of a larger proportion of tax borrowing at banks in June
no doubt reflected the narrowing of the costs between bank credit and
other short-term sources of finance, most of which has occurred since
early May. Upward pressure on short-term market rates encouraged two
banks outside New York to raise their prime rate in early June. But,
with business loan demands remaining weak to moderate at best--and
perhaps in view of the political difficulties envisioned--the higher prime
rate has not yet spread at this writing.
Note: Final data for bank credit developments in May have
become available since the last Greenbook. Also, data for earlier

basis, growth of M1 in June will be substantial, but below the record
May rate. The rate of advance of M2 also appears to have moderated in
early June, primarily reflecting the slowing of growth in M1.

Inflows of time and savings deposits other than large CD's
(mainly consumer-type deposits) remained relatively rapid in early June.
But with the higher level of competitive market rates of interest, at
least two banks on the west coast raised their offering rates on longer-
term consumer-type deposits. Offering rates on large CD's were also in-
creased in early June in an effort to keep pace with the advance in rates
on competing money market instruments. However, with loan demands modest,
the dollar volume of CD's outstanding remained about unchanged on average
in the first half of June as a build-up over the earlier part of the month
was offset by more than seasonal tax date maturities.

III -13
Nondeposit sources of funds, for the first time in several
months, increased somewhat in the early weeks of June. Nearly all of
the increase was in borrowings from U.S. foreign branches. It is not
clear why such borrowings should rise, given the spread of Eurodollar
rates over domestic interest rates; the drop in the Eurodollar call
loan rate below the Federal funds rate occurred after most of the stepped-
up borrowing by U.S. banks.
Nonbank depositary intermediaries. Data thus far available
for June do not make it completely clear how much of a moderation in
deposit inflows may be accompanying short-term market yields that are
rising but are still generally below deposit rate ceilings. Deposit
growth in May at nonbank thrift institutions had dropped from the
advanced rate of the first four months of this year. But, according to
sample data, during the first half of June nonbank thrift institutions
continued to receive quite large deposit inflows. In addition, deposit
patterns at New York City savings banks have not yet shown any
noticeable response to the recent New York City 14-month note, priced
to yield about 6 per cent before the triple tax exemption--Federal, State,
and local--available to residents.

While the forthcoming reinvestment period could provide some
test of the ability of thrift institutions to hold and attract deposits,
the traditional quarterly dividend-crediting periods are becoming in-
creasingly less useful in providing insight into the pattern of savings
flows. As the following table illustrates, savings and loan associations
have locked up an increasing percentage of their deposit liabilities in
accounts with a minimum term over one year. Since the January 1970
rate ceiling changes that enabled the S & L's to offer a significant
differential for term accounts, those liabilities have grown steadily
and strongly--at times at the expense of passbook accounts but creating
in the process a more stable deposit structure. Alternative yields at
any given reinvestment period would have to be sufficiently higher
than the 5.75 per cent one-year and 6 per cent two-year deposit account

III -15
ceilings to induce payment of the early withdrawal penalty for term
accounts before that segment of S&L claims would respond. (The minimum
penalty is one quarter's interest.)

on one-year minimum term accounts, and 5.25 per cent on 90-day
notice accounts. The minimum penalty for early withdrawal is
forfeiture of 90 days' interest.
Even if savings and loan deposit inflows were to drop off
suddenly and sharply this summer, it appears that the S & L's have
retained considerable leeway to honor their outstanding mortgage commit-
ments during the summer--increased though they certainly are. For one
thing, a significant portion of total outstanding commitments probably
represents refinancings of mortgages presently held by the S & L's,
which would require little new mortgage money from S & L's; this can
be inferred from the strong increase in loans actually refinanced during

III -16
the past three months as mortgage interest rates and lending terms eased
considerably. More importantly, as the following table indicates, the
ratio of outstanding commitments to current and recent cash flow is much
lower than it has been in past years -- and the cash flow total used in
calculating the current ratio already excludes the $2.3 billion of
borrowed funds repaid to the FHLB. In addition, associations now have
an unusually high liquid asset ratio, well above the record-high 7.5
per cent required by the FHLBB since May 1. 1/

US Agency issues maturing within five years, as a percentage of
the sum of deposit liabilities and borrowed funds due within one

Mortgage market. Seasonally adjusted growth in new and out-
standing mortgage commitments at insured savings and loan associations
continued unusually strong during May. The record amount of S&L
mortgage commitments outstanding at the end of last month, which was
more than twice the level a year earlier, was bolstered partly by
increased borrower demands to refinance old loans.
S&L mortgage commitment and lending activity has assumed
greater significance this year as other lender groups, including
Federal agencies, has provided less support to the mortgage market.
During the first quarter, the share of S&L net takings of mortgages
on all types of properties sharply increased to 58 per cent of net
acquisitions by all lender groups, as shown in the table. With
respect to residential mortgages, the S&L share of net acquisitions
increased to 76 per cent of the total. In April, indications are that
the S&L share of total net mortgage lending probably increased further.

In the primary market for conventional mortgages on new
houses, contract interest rates edged higher during May--the first rise
in nearly a year. Even so, returns on this type of investment continued
to lose ground relative to yields on new issues of high-grade corporate
bonds. In May, the average gross yield spread on such home mortgages
over corporate bonds declined to minus 13 basis points--the most
unfavorable margin in 7 months, and the fourth largest negative
spread in the history of the mortgage series, which goes back to 1954.

In the more sensitive secondary market for Government under-
written mortgages, FNMA conducted a special auction of its purchase
commitments on June 9. This auction was aimed at reducing the speculative
overhang of home mortgages, including warehoused loans, held by mort-
gage companies and others without firm purchase commitments from private

III -20
investors. In the special auction, FNMA accepted $274 million of the
$1,097 million total offers submitted for immediate delivery of FHA
and VA loans bearing the current ceiling rate of 7 per cent. FNMA's
unprecedented action apparently helped to stabilize this sector of the
market, as suggested by the slightly lower level of yields indicated
on 6-month purchase commitments in FNMA's regular June 14 auction
compared with the results of the June 1 auction. However, average
discounts associated with these purchase commitments remained quite
restrictive, even after allowance for the unusual conditions prevailing
in the secondary market during recent weeks.

Corporate and municipal securities markets. Corporate and
municipal bond yields have fluctuated widely since mid-May, as a
highly sensitive market reacted to swings in short-term interest
rates and to diverse announcements about the domestic and international
outlook. Following yield declines late in May and early June, long-
term rates began to move up sharply, in anticipation of a rise in the
prime rate, as well as in expectation of a shift to a more restrictive
monetary policy stance. By mid-June, long-term yields in the corporate
markets were within 20 basis points of their 1971 high reached in
mid-May, while tax-exempt yields edged above their previous peak in
mid-May. More recently, a new Aaa-rated Bell System debenture was
offered to yield 7.80 per cent, appreciably below comparable yields
in the weak ending June 18. This offering was not well received by
investors.
Over the last few days, stock prices have declined sharply
on relatively large volume. According to the financial press, the
immediate cause for the decline was the announcement of a relatively
low May level of mutual fund liquidity and an unprecedented net
redemption of mutual fund shares during May; other bearish factors
included concern about the strength of economic recovery and the recent
increase in interest rates. Prior to the recent decline, stock prices
on both the New York and American Exchanges had been relatively stable

III -22
for the previous four weeks. Combined NYSE and AMEX volume, though
still high by historical standards, had been somewhat lower than the
average level prevailing from January through April of 1971.

that July volume will be about $1.7 billion. This would be the first
time in almost a year that public bond volume dropped below $2 billion,
but it is still significantly above the average monthly volume in this
market in any year before 1970.
New stock issues continued at high levels, even aside from
the $1.4 billion AT&T rights issue, which will boost the July total
to a record level. The relatively high level of public bond offerings
and the surge in equity financing, combined with an apparent pickup
in private placements in recent months, have resulted in a near-record
monthly average volume of total corporate security offerings from
April through July.

Although total second-quarter volume of State and local long-
term debt issues is below the record first-quarter level, tax exempt
bonds are still being offered at levels close to $2 billion a month.
In the last few weeks, the pace of acquisitions by both banks and fire
and casualty companies has slackened somewhat, and this has exerted
upward pressure on municipal yields. Municipal demands for long-term
funds have not abated, but there may be some seasonal tapering in new
issues in July.

$3 billion in June--the increasing volume of maturing issues largely
offset the recent rise in gross offerings, with a number of governments
apparently deciding to fund their maturing short-term obligations rather
than renew them.

Government securities market. Interest rates in all sectors of the
government securities market rose sharply in the interval between the early
June Open Market Committee meeting and mid-June. Initially, expectations of
a tightening of monetary policy and later the observed higher rate levels in
the Federal funds market--above the discount rate--contributed to marked down-
ward adjustments in security prices. Also the moves by the two banks to raise
their prime interest rates and anticipations of large Treasury borrowing needs
added to cautious attitudes. Since mid-month, however--and since Treasury's
announcement of financings on June 16 (for details see section on Federal
Finance)--the Government securities market recovered and prices have tended
to move higher.

On balance, yields in the bill market have risen 30 to 50 basis
points, while intermediate-term yields are up by about 25 basis points.
Rates in the coupon sector adjusted sharply upward during the two trading
days when the Federal funds rate reached a level of 5 per cent and when
some prime rate increases were announced. At the time of the peak in' yields--
on June 15--intermediate-term interest rates had increased by as much as 40
basis points from June 7, but since then a fair-sized rally has developed.
During the period since June 7, dealers' positions have been moderate,
suggesting a cautious attitude by dealers.

In the market for Federal agencies, new issue activity has been
relatively light in June. Responding to the general upward movements in
interest rates, yields on agency issues have increased by around 35 to 55
basis points since June 7.
Other short-term credit markets. Over the past three weeks, short-
term rates, with the exception of finance company paper, continued their
upward movement, with gains ranging up to 76 basis points. Several rates--
notably those on three-month commercial paper and on bankers' acceptances--
are now above the 5-1/2 per cent prime rate. However, commercial paper rates
have lagged the very sharp rise in bill rates, the spread narrowing between
commercial paper and Treasury bills in the three-month maturity range from
137 basis points on June 2 to 78 basis points on June 16.
On a seasonally-adjusted basis, finance company paper outstanding
showed a decline of $361 million for May. Large long-term borrowings on the
capital market early in the month by several finance companies and the May
increase in bank loans to nonbank financial institutions suggests that these
have been alternative sources of funds. Weekly data for June, however, do
show a substantial increase in finance paper outstanding.
Total commercial and finance company paper fell by more than $400
in
million May to $30.7 billion, the lowest outstanding amount since September 1969.
Dealer paper outstanding continued to decline somewhat during May at a time
when business loans expanded substantially.

Federal finance. The staff continues to estimate a Federal deficit
in the current fiscal year of about $22 billion. (The actual figures will not
be known until late July.) In regard to fiscal year 1972, preliminary Staff
estimates suggest a Federal deficit of about $23 billion but the outlook is
still highly uncertain because Congress has not completed action on a number

III -30
of important bills. The two most significant developments since the last
Greenbook relate to military pay and public service employment.
The Senate recently passed an amendment to the Selective Service Act
that is similar to legislation already passed in the House increasing the
total military pay bill by $2.8 billion annually, in a move toward an all
volunteer army. This Senate action was unexpected because the Senate had
previously rejected the larger House appropriation in the favor of a smaller
($1.2 billion) Administration request. Earlier Staff estimates had allowed
for a middle ground $1.8 billion outlay for this program in fiscal 1972, but
now incorporate the larger $2.8 billion increase.
Another recent development involves reports that the Administration
may not veto the public service employment bill now being deliberated by the
House-Senate conference committee. Passage of this bill had been previously
assumed in the Staff expenditure estimates.
During the first half of June the Treasury's cash balance was
substantially below projected levels and the Treasury resorted to special
borrowing from the Federal Reserve. The shortfall in the cash balance was
due in part to higher-than-expected expenditures early in the month and to
the redemption of special issues held by foreigners. While the special
borrowing from the Federal Reserve was repaid following the seasonal mid-
month inflow of tax receipts, the Treasury's cash balance was still relatively
low and, thus, the Treasury announced on June 16 plans to auction $2.25 billion
of 16-1/2 month notes, payable on June 29, and $1.75 billion of tax bills
payable on July 6. As a result of this financing announcement, the Staff
estimate of the end-of-June cash balance has been revised upward to about
$7.8 billion.

III -31
Current staff estimates suggest that net Treasury borrowing from the
public will be about $23 billion in the second half of calendar 1971, a record
for recent half-years and nearly $7 billion higher than last year. Relative
to GNP, net Treasury borrowing has been higher in only two periods since
1950--the second half of calendar years 1953 and 1967. Net Treasury borrowing
for the period between late June and late August is now estimated to be about
$11.0 billion. However, the specific timing and amounts of future Treasury
market borrowing operations will be significantly affected by what happens to
the special issues held by foreign central banks. A recent Treasury announce-
ment indicates that the June 21 weekly bill auction will be increased by $100
million, and the Staff estimates assume that the Treasury will continue this
addition to its regular weekly bill auctions for some time. Given these
assumptions, the Treasury will need to go to the market for approximately
$2.5 billion in new money late in July and a smaller amount sometime in
August. The July borrowing might be tax bills maturing next spring, and
perhaps the Treasury will obtain its new money in August in conjunction with
the quarterly refunding.

THE ECONOMIC PICTURE IN DETAIL
International Developments
Foreign exchange markets. In the three weeks since the
last Greenbook the German Federal Bank has undertaken to sell off a
large amount of its dollar reserves in order to reduce the domestic
monetary base swollen by the speculative inflows of early May.
Such sales during June 2-4 amounted to about $150 million, but have
since averaged roughly one-quarter of a billion dollars per day.
Netting out some $500 million received on maturing forward contracts,
the Bundesbank's reserves have declined by nearly $1.9 billion thus
far in June. As a result of the Bundesbank's large sales of dollars
(purchases of marks), the spot DM appreciated rather steadily, reach-
ing a high of 28.62 U.S. cents, i.e., 4.8 per cent above par,on June 23.
The Bundesbank's reserve drain, and the consequent contraction
of the domestic monetary base, has led to a considerably tightening of
the German money market. Call money has risen from around 4 per cent
on June 1 (and much less in May) to over 8-1/2 per cent currently.
Three-month funds in Frankfurt, around 6-1/8 per cent at the first
of the month,are now quoted at about 7 per cent. The reversal of
the differential between German and Euro-dollar interest rates,
combined with the firming of the spot DM, has led to a sharp narrowing
of the premium on forward DM. Three-month forward marks were quoted

IV -2
at a premium of about 4 per cent per annum the first two days of
this month; this premium has fallen to less than 1/4 per cent per
annum at present.
It is not yet completely clear what has happened to the funds
coming out of marks. Of course, we can never trace the movement of
particular funds, but it appears that of the reserves released by the
Bundesbank's dollar sales plus those currently generated by the U.S.
liquidity deficit, something over $1-1/4 billion was "absorbed" by
net reserve gains of Japan and the U.K. A much smaller amount seems
to have returned to the United States through the Euro-dollar market
as U.S. banks increased their liabilities to their foreign branches
(see Euro-dollar market), thereby holding down the U.S. official
settlements deficit.
The Bank of Japan made intervention purchases of dollars
totaling nearly $900 million this month, through the 23rd. The U.K.
has had spot market intervention purchases totaling just over $200
million, but there are indications that the Bank of England has had
additional dollar receipts on maturing forward contracts. Sterling
has held fairly close to the upper limit for the past three weeks,
partly reflecting reported oil company purchases, but perhaps also
reflecting some interest-induced movement of funds into London. Very
short-term sterling interest rates (over-night and seven-day) have
generally been 1/2 per cent or so above comparable Euro-dollar rates.

IV -3
Other major European currencies have generally eased over
the past couple of weeks, and there has been only scattered inter-
vention by central banks in those markets. The Belgian franc rate
weakened sharply on June 10, when the central bank imposed a 100 per
cent marginal reserve requirement on Belgian banks' net foreign lia-
bilities. The rate remained depressed until June 23, when it suddenly
jumped almost to the ceiling. The Dutch guilder, after advancing sharply
in the first few days following the Bundesbank's initiation of dollar
sales, has eased substantially, and is currently only 1.6 per cent
above its parity rate.
The Canadian dollar has declined by roughly one full cent
this month to 97.7 U.S. cents at present, with the Bank of Canada
providing modest support. Recent rises in U.S. short-term interest
rates relative to Canadian rates are generally regarded as being the
most important factor in the weakening of the Canadian dollar.
In official transactions in June, the U.S. Treasury drew
$150 million equivalent in Belgian francs and $100 million equivalent
in Dutch guilders on the IMF. The proceeds were used to repay $150
million of System swap drawings on the Belgian National Bank, reducing
the outstanding amount to $340 million, and to reduce by $100 million
the Netherlands Bank's holdings of uncovered dollar reserves. The
Treasury also sold $50 million equivalent of gold to the Swiss National
Bank.

IV -4
Euro-dollar market. Some relaxation in the speculative
atmosphere in foreign exchange markets and a sizable flow of funds
out of the German mark (and to a lesser extent the Swiss franc)
have contributed to a fairly steady decline in interest rates in the
Euro-dollar market since around the end of May -- in the face of
recent advances in U.S. interest rates. One- and three-month Euro-
dollar deposit rates are now about 6-3/4 to 7 per cent, compared to
about 8 per cent in late May and the first few days of June -- still
well above their January-April average level of roughly 5-1/2 per
cent and about 1-1/2 per cent above domestic CD ratee of
comparable maturity. The overnight Euro-dollar deposit rate has

declined quite markedly in the last few weeks and of late has been
about 1/4 to 1/2 per cent below the Federal funds rate. (See table.)
The low level of overnight Euro-dollar rates relative to
longer maturities may reflect funds that have moved out of German
marks which have been temporarily placed in Euro-dollars prior to
repatriation to the U.S. or other countries shortly before the
quarter-end; if so, we may expect a sharp firming in Euro-dollar rates
(particularly in the shorter maturities) in the last few days of
June -- coupled with a decline in liabilities of U.S. banks to their
foreign branches reflecting these repatriations (including U.S.
company repatriations under OFDI guidelines).
Gross liabilities of U.S. banks to their foreign branches
increased by about $0.6 billion in the three weeks through June 16;
from then to June 21 (the last day for which data are available as
of this writing) these liabilities have shown little net change.
These liabilities plus foreign branch holdings of special Ex-Im
and Treasury notes totaled about $5.3 billion as of June 21.
On the basis of partial data it is estimated that U.S.
banks' Euro-dollar borrowings and foreign branch holdings of the
above mentioned notes averaged about $0.3 billion 1ess in the four
weeks ended June 9 than in the previous four week Euro-dollar
borrowing reserve requirement computation period, compared to a
decline of about $0.4 billion the period before.

IV -6
U.S. balance of payments. Over the past four weeks the
overall balance on the liquidity basis has shown deficits averaging
over $100 million a week according to preliminary information.
In addition to the underlying deficit, it is probable that nonbank
funds have continued to move to the Euro-dollar market and also,
through commercial leads and lags, into the Japanese yen. On the
official settlements basis, the average balance in the past four
weeks has been very small, as borrowing by U.S. banks from their
foreign branches has picked up.
With respect to the underlying deficit, there is a strong
possibility that developments in trade (as noted below) have been
unfavorable. See page IV-8.
Detailed information now available on first-quarter
transactions shows that about two-thirds of the worsening in the
seasonally adjusted liquidity deficit between the fourth quarter
of 1970 and the first quarter of this year resulted from an increase
in outflows of U.S. capital attracted by higher interest rates abroad
and the possibility of changes in foreign exchange rates. Errors and
omissions, the changes in which are presumed to represent largely
unidentified capital outflows, increased by more that $1 billion from
the fourth quarter. Net outflows of U.S. corporate capital increased
by $3/4 billion in the first quarter; this reflected not only a
substantial increase in direct investments in affiliates abroad but

IV -7
also a swing in the recorded movement of U.S. corporate short-term
funds held abroad, from inflows in the fourth quarter to outflows
in the first quarter. The same factors that were responsible for
the large increase in errors and omissions, i.e., widening differentials
between interest rates here and abroad and exchange market uncertainties,
promoted these shifts in the flows of corporate capital.
These adverse changes were only partially offset by an
improvement in the first-quarter balances on both goods and services
and a temporary reversal of the flow of bank lending to foreigners.
The increase in the trade balance stemmed from a peaking in exports
of agricultural commodities, from exceptionally large deliveries of
jumbo jets, and from an upturn in shipments of automobile parts
following the termination of the GM strike. This trade improvement
appears to have been transitory and was followed by a deficit in
April. Imports may again have exceeded exports in May, as discussed
below.
The favorable balance on services in the first quarter rose
further -- by $1 billion at an annual rate -- following a nearly
equally large rise from the third to the fourth quarter of last year.
These increases resulted mainly from a reduction in net payments
on military transactions as transfers under sales contracts rose,
and an increase in net income receipts as income payments fell with
the decline in domestic interest rates.

IV -8
U.S. foreign trade. Based on partial information (custom
receipts, number of shippers' export declarations, and certain
commodity data), it appears that the U.S. trade balance in May
improved only very moderately from the $300 million import balance
(balance of payments basis -- not at annual rate) recorded in
April. Exports are estimated to have increased from the relatively
low April level but imports in May are estimated to be about as
high as the record April value. The official statistics may be
available for inclusion in a supplement to the Greenbook.
While much of the poor trade showing this year can be
attributed to the exceptional strength in imports, it also appears
that the U.S. share of world trade in manufactured goods slipped
further in the first quarter of 1971. The U.S. share in that
period was more than one percentage point lower than in the
corresponding period a year earlier -- roughly equivalent to an
annual loss of over $1-1/2 billion. The U.K.'s position in the
first quarter of this year also weakened while the shares of Germany
and Japan rose very sharply.
Commodity-by-commodity information on market shares is not
yet available for the first quarter of this year, but a recent
Department of Commerce report indicated that in calendar 1970
declines occurred in all major product groups except chemicals in
which our share was unchanged. (The drop in the U.S. share in
1970 was particularly pronounced in transport equipment, partly

IV -9
because of the GM strike.) Although U.S. exports of electric
and nonelectric machinery increased by 13 and 17 per cent,
respectively, from 1969 to 1970, sales of other countries increased
even faster, resulting in a substantial reduction in our share
in world exports of machinery.

IV -10
Interest rate movements in major industrial countries.
Domestic short-term interest rates in most major European countries
registered net declines in the second quarter. After decreasing every-
where in Europe in April, short-term yields subsequently either held
steady or moved upward, but only in France -- where monetary policy
was tightened in May -- are interest rates now higher than they were
at the end of the first quarter.
The drop in domestic yields in April occurred despite a rise
in Euro-dollar rates that began in mid-March (and continued through May)
but followed a prolonged downward movement in Euro-dollar yields dating
from mid-1970. In June Euro-dollar rates again decreased, reflecting
in part net large-scale purchases of marks (sales of dollars) by the
Bundesbank. Simultaneously, German money market yields have risen under
the consequent tightening of liquidity pressures.
The fall in European money market rates early in the second
quarter was in line with the policy in several countries of seeking to
halt or reduce dollar inflows. However, in Germany and in the Netherlands,
the decline in short-term yields was largely in response to the increased
liquidity resulting from the continuation of capital inflows.
Narrowing the differentials between domestic and Euro-dollar
yields was the prime reason for the discount rate reductions in late
March and early April in Belgium, Germany, the United Kingdom and the
Netherlands.

IV -11
In Germany, it was hoped that a reduction of dollar inflows
would support domestic demand-restraint policies by making it easier
to restrict the liquidity of the banking system. The cut in the German
discount rate was accompanied by a reduction in rediscount quotas and
intensification of the Bundesbank's open market operations with nonbanks.
In the Netherlands, where inflationary pressures were particularly
intense, there was no easing of previously imposed strict quantitative
controls on credit expansion.
In Britain, on the other hand, lower interest rates were in
harmony with the policy of stimulating the economy adopted by the government

at the end of March. In Belgium, too, reduced rates were not unwanted
in the light of an anticipated slowdown in domestic growth this year.
And declining short-term yields were also welcomed as a tool for
promoting economic expansion in Italy, where a downward trend in
interest rates that began in the summer of 1970 was given additional
impetus by cuts in central bank lending rates in January and April.
Reducing the spread between domestic and Euro-dollar rates
helped decrease net capital inflows into Britain. In Germany, however,
the demand for marks did not diminish appreciably in April.
When capital inflows based on expectations that the mark would
be revalued became overwhelmingly large at the beginning of May, differ-
entials between yields on domestic assets in the Netherlands and comparable
Euro-dollar deposits also became irrelevant. The Dutch guilder, along
with the Austrian schilling, was subjected to intense speculative demand
on the correct assumption that their parities could not survive a
revaluation or unpegging of the mark, which was in fact floated on May 9.
Speculative demand outweighed interest rate considerations in
Switzerland and Belgium, too, where revaluations were also expected
(contrary to the event in the case of the Belgian franc) as part of the
general upheaval in the exchange markets.
Outside of Europe, short-term Canadian interest rates fell in
the first two months of the year and have since been flat. The stability
of Canadian rates in the face of rising yields in the United States
reflects, in part, an attempt by the Canadian authorities to ease upward
pressure on the exchange rate of the Canadian dollar in order to aid

IV -13
Canadian export industries, whose profits have suffered from the
appreciation of the Canadian dollar. Furthermore, low interest rates
are part of the overall stimulative policy now being pursued by the
government.
Japanese short-term rates have declined this year, reflecting
a loosening of monetary policy.
In general, long-term interest rates fell substantially in
late 1970 and in early 1971. In Germany, the United Kingdom and Canada
there have been subsequent sharp upturns. In Germany, the rise in long-
term yields was initially the result of profit taking but, more recently,
has reflected efforts by businesses to replace heavy short-term debt
obligations with longer-term liabilities. In the United Kingdom, yields
have risen during the second quarter largely in response to expectations
of continuing inflation and to doubts about the long-term balance of
payments outlook. In Canada, increased demand for funds has combined
with a revival of inflationary expectations to push up long-term rates.
In France, the recent tightening of monetary policy has driven bond
yields up. Elsewhere, there have been no pronounced movements in bond
prices in recent months.
After declining substantially in April, German money market
rates have risen in June as the liquidity of the banking system has been
reduced. Earlier, German interest rates had shown little change during
the first quarter. The combination of a ready supply of Euro-dollars,
strong demand for funds by both bank and nonbank borrowers in Germany,

IV -14
and a large and widening differential between German and Euro-dollar
rates -- the uncovered monthly average excess of the three-month inter-
bank loan rate over the 90-day Euro-dollar deposit rate widened from
1.63 percentage points in January to 2.49 percentage points in March --
helped produce major capital inflows.
Though a large portion of these inflows was absorbed or offset
by restrictive reserve requirements and open market sales by the Bundesbank,
bank liquidity expanded to the point where the government felt that its
stabilization program was in jeopardy. Consequently, the Bundesbank
lowered its discount rate from 6 to 5 per cent on April 1 and its rate
on advances, which is more closely related to market rates, from 7-1/2 to
6-1/2 per cent. Domestic rates subsequently fell in April. Coupled with
rising Euro-dollar rates, this drastically reduced the gap between the
latter and German money market rates. The three-month interbank loan
rate did not exceed the return on 90-day Euro-dollar deposits by more
than half a point at any time in April, and in early May -- before the
mark was floated -- the 90-day Euro-dollar rate rose above the interbank
loan rate.
Capital inflows -- which were the main cause of the drop in
interest rates -- remained heavy through much of April, reflecting strong
expectations of a rise in the mark exchange rate. This was indicated by
the relatively small decrease in the covered differential in favor of
the interbank loan rate, despite the marked change in the uncovered
differential.

IV -15
For almost a month after the mark was floated, short-term
rates remained stable; but in early June rates rose, as the capital
inflows in the period before the mark was floated were reversed by
large-scale dollar sales by the Bundesbank. Interest rates in June
have also been pushed up by a rise in minimum reserve requirements on
June 1 and by mid-year balance sheet positioning,
Long-term yields in Germany fell sharply from mid-December
through January as liquid holdings and savings were shifted into long-
term securities on a large scale in anticipation of lower rates and a
general relaxation of monetary restraint. The average yield on public
authority bonds fell from 8.17 per cent in December to 7.68 per cent in
January. Since January, however, yields have edged upward and are now
near the levels which prevailed at the end of 1970. In recent months,
the market has become congested with new issues. Restrictions on floating
new issues were imposed for the month of June, but reportedly the
moratorium is being circumvented by direct placing of medium-term notes.
Short-term interest rates in the Netherlands remained high in
the first quarter, reflecting the tight credit policy being pursued by
the monetary authorities in order to reduce excess demand and inflationary
pressures in the Dutch economy.
On April 5, the Netherlands Bank cut its discount rate from 6
to 5-1/2 per cent, following the reduction in the Bundesbank rate a few
days earlier. Capital inflows into the Netherlands had been heavy in the
first quarter. The Dutch monetary authorities welcomed the opportunity

IV -15
the action of the Bundesbank gave them to reduce the gap between Dutch
and Euro-dollar rates without creating the impression of easing domestic
restraint (as they might have done had the Dutch discount rate been
lowered in the absence of a similar move by the German authorities).
Quantitative limitations on extension of credit were maintained.
After the discount rate reduction, short-term interest rates
(in particular, the rate on call money) fell and since then have for the
most part remained at a low level. The lowering of interest rates failed
to check capital inflows. Inflows abated somewhat in April, but resumed
on a large scale when speculative demand for the guilder mounted in early
May.
Since the guilder was floated there has been no further
tightening of monetary restrictions, but there has been no easing; and
with capital inflows no longer augmenting liquidity, interest rates may
well rise in the future.
Long-term yields in the Netherlands have declined about 50
basis points during 1971, reflecting the large capital inflows before
the guilder was floated.
Short-term interest rates in the United Kingdom held stable or
edged upward during the first quarter, despite the downward movement in
Euro-dollar rates during most of that period, reflecting the government's
effort to maintain tight money.
The widening spread between sterling and Euro-dollar rates in
the first quarter caused heavy short-term capital inflows. In addition,

IV -17
the prospects of capital gains -- it was generally assumed that British
interest rates would fall relatively soon -- made longer-term British
assets attractive to foreign investors. Total net capital inflow
(including errors and omissions) in January-March exceeded $2 billion
and was a major factor in the 13 per cent (seasonally adjusted annual
rate) expansion of the money supply in the first quarter.
Largely to stem the capital inflow, the Bank of England
lowered its discount rate on April 1 by a full percentage point --
traditionally, Bank rate decreases have been by half a point only -- from
7 to 6 per cent. Though the influx of capital was helping Britain reduce
its short-term external debt -- repayments in the first quarter totalled
about $1.6 billion, including almost $700 million to the IMF -- the
authorities feared that a continuing accumulation of external liabilities
based on volatile, interest-sensitive capital could ultimately have
destabilizing consequences for the pound, should the massive inflow
abruptly become a massive outflow. Furthermore, reducing interest rates
was consistent with the stimulative measures the government announced in
presenting its annual budget to Parliament on March 30.
Short-term interest rates in Britain have fallen since the
beginning of April.
Despite the lower yields on sterling assets and the higher
Euro-dollar rates, demand for sterling has generally remained strong in
the second quarter and there have reportedly been sizable capital inflows
though not as large as in the first three months of the year. The

IV -18
announcement at the end of April by the Bundesbank of its withdrawal
from the forward market apparently triggered some purchases of sterling
as well as of marks.
Long-term yields in Britain declined during the first quarter,
despite large-scale selling of government bonds by the Bank of England
which was striving to moderate increases in the money supply and in bond
prices. Since Bank rate was cut, however, yields on long-term government
bonds have risen somewhat, mainly because of expectation of persisting
inflation and doubt about the long-term outlook for the balance of payments.
Short-term interest rates declined sharply in Belgium in the
first quarter, as was evidenced by the fall in the tap rate on three-
month Treasury bills from 6.95 per cent at the end of December to 4.80
per cent on April 6. The decrease in yields was partly associated with
the decline in Euro-dollar rates but also reflected the effects of a
large current account surplus. The National Bank of Belgium encouraged
the downtrend in interest rates by lowering the discount rate from 6.5
to 6 per cent on March 25.
Short-term rates have been stable in the second quarter, as
Euro-dollar rate rises since mid-March have been offset by speculative
demand for the Belgian franc, which has led to further increases in bank
liquidity and official foreign exchange reserves. Speculation became
particularly intense in May.
Long-term yields also dropped this year -- by about 40 basis
points in the case of bond yields -- but practically all of the decrease
occurred in January and February.

IV -19
During the first quarter France kept domestic short-term
interest rates in line with Euro-dollar rates by frequent reductions
in the central bank's money market intervention rate. This tactic,
together with exchange controls, partially insulated France from the
capital inflows and consequent excess liquidity which plagued other
European countries.
Money market rates continued to decline in April but rose
substantially in May, as monetary policy, expansionary in the first
quarter, was tightened. Commercial bank reserve requirements were
raised twice during the month and the Bank of France discount rate
was raised from 6-1/2 to 6-3/4 per cent on May 13. The reversal in
monetary policy was motivated by the persistence of the rapid rate of
increase in both wages and prices.
Long-term yields in France fell by about 15 basis points from
January to February. Since then, they have risen moderately and
currently stand slightly above the January level.
The general downward movement of Italian interest rates,
which began in August 1970, continued through the first four months of
1970. Declines in interest rates outside Italy reinforced the effects
on the Italian interest rate structure produced by continuing large
increases in the monetary base (currency and other liabilities of the
Bank of Italy). The buildup in the monetary base, which began last
autumn, reflects the easier monetary policy that the Bank of Italy
initiated in the fourth quarter and has maintained this year. The Bank

IV -20
of Italy cut the rate on advances from 5-1/2 to 5 per cent in January
and reduced its discount rate from 5-1/2 to 5 per cent in early April.
With respect to short-term yields, the rate on time deposits
of 100 million lire or more, which had dropped by two percentage points
in the final four months of 1970, declined from 6 per cent at the end
of December to 4-3/4 per cent at the end of April. Between December
and April banks lowered their lending rates -- something they had not
done in the closing months of 1970, despite the fall in deposit rates --
the prime rate reportedly falling by 100 basis points.
Bond yields plummeted in January and February and then edged
down a little further in March and April. The decline in yields during
these four months amounted to about 75 basis points. The drop in yields
from their peak level in July 1970 has been about 150 basis points.
Reflecting the easy monetary policy in force since early 1970,
Canadian short-term yields trended downward through most of last year.
There was a moderate upturn in rates at the end of the year and through
January 1971, followed by an exceptionally sharp decline in February.
Since then rates have remained level despite the rise in short-term rates
in the United States.
The recent unusual negative spread between Canadian and U.S.
3-month rates may have contributed to the recent decline in the exchange
rate of the Canadian dollar, which is expected to bring some relief to
export interests. Exporters claim to have suffered serious injury as a
result of the appreciation of the Canadian dollar -- from about 93.25

IV -21
to as high as 100 -- since it was floated on June 1, 1970. The rate is
now $97.64.
Easy money, with attendant low interest rates, is also part
of a general reflationary policy designed to lift Canada out of a
recession which has been steeper than the one in the United States.
Developments in Canadian bond markets have roughly paralleled
those in the United States in recent months. Yields declined sharply
in late 1970 and early 1971 but have risen noticeably in recent weeks
in response to increased demands for long-term funds and revived infla-
tionary expectations.
In Japan, interest rates have generally declined since the
Bank of Japan relaxed its tight money policy last summer. The Bank
lowered its basic discount rate one-quarter of a percentage point three
times -- on October 28, January 20 and May 8 -- and the rate is currently
5-1/2 per cent. The Bank also eased its ceilings on city bank lending
in the fourth quarter of last year and suspended them altogether in
January 1971. Loan demand increased during the first quarter of this
year, but it has reportedly slackened since early April.
Call loan rates have declined this year, dropping from 8.0 per
cent at the end of December to 5.5 per cent on June 5. The yield on long-
term industrial bonds has declined moderately, from 8.69 per cent at the
end of December to 8.14 per cent in March. The average interest rate on
bank loans has also been declining, but at a slower rate than after
comparable reductions in the official discount rate in the past.

IV -22
In May, Japan took a series of modest steps to reduce the
excessive rate of accumulation of international reserves. These measures
included the establishment of ceilings on the borrowings of overseas
Japanese banks and a prohibition against the purchase by foreigners of
unlisted Japanese securities.
