SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK
Nonfinancial
Real GNP increased at an annual rate of 3.6 per cent in the
second quarter, according to the preliminary Commerce estimate. This
was somewhat more than the staff projection of four weeks ago, and
reflected a smaller increase in the GNP implicit deflator than we had
expected rather than a larger increase in nominal GNP. Consumer spend-
ing showed considerable strength, while residential construction
activity moved up strongly further. In June, housing starts remained
at close to a 2 million unit annual rate. A part of the rise in
domestic sales reflected an upsurge in imports. Industrial production
rose further in June and for the second quarter advanced at a 4 per
cent annual rate.
Retail sales were appreciably stronger in the second quarter
than had been indicated earlier. April sales were revised up consider-
ably and a sizable increase was reported for June. For the quarter as
a whole, sales at nondurable goods outlets rose substantially. Total
unit auto sales remained at about the first quarter rate, with sales
of domestic-type cars off slightly and imports up further.
Book value of inventories rose at about the same moderate
rate in May as in April, and a little faster than in the first quarter,
Much of the growth continued to be in steel and autos, with some further
liquidation in durable goods manufacturing apart from the steel buildup.

I -2
The overall business stock-sales ratio was again unchanged, at a level
considerably improved from early this year.
The sharp decline in the unemployment rate in June, to 5.6
per cent from 6.2 per cent in May, is apparently attributable largely
to problems of seasonal measurement. The labor force also showed a
large decline as did nonfarm employment. The insured unemployment rate
rose slightly further in June, while initial claims most recently have
been edging down.
The wholesale price index rose appreciably further from
May to June, with prices up for both farm and food products and for
industrial commodities. Among the latter, the rise in intermediate
materials continued especially strong, with lumber and wood products
and textiles up considerably.
Outlook. Prospects for the second half of 1971 appear to
have strengthened somewhat recently, and we are now projecting an
increase in current dollar GNP averaging $23 billion a quarter, $1-1/2
billion more than four weeks ago. Real GNP is projected to rise at
an annual rate of 3.8 per cent, revised up from 3.2 per cent. We
continue to assume no steel strike, but current dollar GNP is now ex-
pected to increase more in the fourth than in the third quarter, pri-
marily because the military pay raise bill is now assumed to be effec-
tive around October 1 rather than July 1. For the year 1971 as a
whole, GNP is projected at $1,052 billion.
We have raised the earlier projection of the rise in consumer

I-3
spending for the last half of this year on the basis bf recent vigor
in retail sales. We continue to assume that the saving rate will
decline from its exceptionally high level, which was further boosted
in the second quarter by the retroactive payment in late June of
increased social security benefits. We have also raised inventory
accumulation slightly, as a likely response to stronger consumer
demand. But net exports now are assumed to be negative in view of
the recent strength of imports. Changes in other demand sectors
are about the same as projected in the preceding Greenbook.
Expansion is projected to accelerate in the first half of
1972, with real GNP rising at an annual rate of 5.3 per cent over the
two quarters. Consumer spending is expected to continue to expand
at a fairly rapid pace. Inventory investment is projected to rise
substantially in response to higher levels of final sales and to the
end of the workdown of excessive steel stocks. And business fixed
investment is expected to begin to pick up.
We continue to project some moderation in the rate of
increase of the private fixed-weight GNP price deflator over the
next year, to about 4-1/2 per cent in the fourth quarter and to
4-1/4 per cent in the second quarter of next year. The increase
in the second quarter of this year is officially estimated at
4.9 per cent, down from the first quarter but equal to the 1970
rise on average. Recent wage developments, along with the pattern
of sustained increases in price quotations, do not promise much

I -4
progress on this score, even if productivity should rise somewhat more
rapidly with faster economic recovery.
Financial
The recent tightening of the money market and the one-
fourth point rise in the discount rate were followed by increases
of 10 to 25 basis points in bill rates and up to 15 basis points
in bond yields. Prior to the discount rate announcement, short-
term rates had edged up since the last Committee meeting while
long-term rates had declined somewhat.
Credit demands of the business sector appear to have
moderated in recent weeks, Outstanding business loans at banks
declined sharply in June and have shown essentially no growth over
the last year. The amount of commercial paper placed by businesses
through dealers declined for the fifth consecutive month. With re-
gard to longer-term borrowing, corporate bond offerings were still
large in June, but market participants were emphasizing the ex-
pected declining volume this summer. In this environment, Treasury
financing operations in late June and early July were absorbed easily.
Inflows of consumer-type interest-bearing deposits to all
depository institutions in June remained at about the same relatively
high rate as in May. During the recently-concluded reinvestment
period nonbank thrift institutions experienced no major attrition
of deposits; in fact, S&L s experienced net inflows. Commercial

I-5
banks, on the other hand, appear to have had weaker consumer-type
time and savings deposit inflows in the early weeks of the month,
and there were reports that some banks have increased offering
rates on such deposits.
Outlook. Assuming short-term rates rise only a little further as
they adjust to the recent increases in the Federal funds and dis-
count rates, a downdrift in long-term market rates is a reasonable
expectation for the third quarter since corporate and municipal
demands on capital markets appear to be moderating. Nonfinancial
corporations seem to have completed a significant proportion of
their financial restructuring. While this development should re-
duce loan repayments at banks, the higher level of corporate cash
flows and liquidity and the very modest growth in inventories ex-
pected this quarter do not suggest that either banks or the money
market will be required to extend a large volume of credit to busi-
nesses. Thus, if deposit inflows do not deteriorate, banks will have
ample resources to finance U. S. Government and State and local Govern-
ment demands.
In part, the expected lower State and local financing de-
mands in the third quarter reflect a reduced financing backlog, but
the current interest rate level is also constraining the new issue
pace of smaller units and those with lower credit ratings. The Treas-
ury is expected to borrow, net, only about $7 billion this quarter,

I-6
one-fourth of which was already completed early this month, and
another one-fourth involves a special issue to the Bundesbank. A
major factor in the moderate Treasury financing demands over the
summer months is the Treasury's decision to run a relatively low
cash balance; this pattern of debt management implies a significant
increase in financing volume in the fourth quarter.
Funds for residential mortgage investment should remain
ample this summer. Inflows to thrift institutions are expected to
remain relatively large, although below the second quarter pace.
Moreover, even if shor-term yields rise further, withdrawals will
tend to remain limited by the increased proportion of deposit
accounts in higher rate term form with early withdrawal penalties.
In addition, mortgage repayments are likely to remain large and
the FHLB's are expected to increase their lending to S&L's. As a
result, conventional mortgage rates may change little further. At
the same time, with discounts acting as a constraint on new credit
extensions, the seven per cent contract interest rate still prevail-
ing on new FHA-and VA-underwritten mortgages may need to be adjusted
upward by administrative action to bring it more closely in line with
other rates.
Balance of Payments
U. S. merchandise imports, which had risen extremely sharply
between March and May, held at about the May level in June according
to preliminary indications. The second-quarter rate of imports was

I-7
almost one-fifth above the level a year earlier. With second-quarter
exports only slightly higher than a year ago, the trade balance in
the second quarter now appears to have been a deficit of between $3
and $4 billion annual rate, unprecedented since World II. (At the
time of the Committee's last meeting the projection for the second-
quarter trade balance was minus $2 billion, annual rate.) This means
that the preliminary estimate in the GNP accounts for net exports of
goods and services in the second quarter is likely to be revised
down to a negative rate of more than $1 billion.
The present outlook is that net exports of goods and services
should continue in coming quarters near minus $1 billion, with mod-
erate advances in both exports and imports. The export projection
assumed much stronger growth of demand abroad, particularly in Canada
and Japan, than has been evident so far this year. The main reason
for not expecting a further deterioration in the goods and services
balance in the second half of the year is that some of the recent
sharp rise in imports can be ascribed to inventory buildups (e.g.,
in steel, lumber, and coffee) which may not continue, and some of it
reflects an abrupt upward shift in imports (e.g., of petroleum) not
likely to be repeated immediately.
The mammoth size of the official settlements deficits in
the first and second quarters ($5.7 billion and about $6 billion
respectively--seasonally adjusted quarterly amounts) was due primarily

I-8
to flows of capital responding to interest rate differentials and
expectations of exchange rate changes. Between the two quarters
there were important changes in the character of these flows, and
the worsening in the goods and services balance, in quarterly terms,
by more than $1 billion was an important factor keeping the deficit
so large.
In the first quarter there was a $3 billion net outflow
to U. S. bank branches abroad and other foreign banks, reducing
total U. S. bank and Government liabilities to commercial banks
abroad by that amount on balance. In the second quarter interest rate
differences became less significant, while the influence of exchange
rate uncertainties mounted. There was relatively little further net
runoff in the liabilities to commercial banks, but U. S. nonfinancial
corporations and other U. S. and foreign investors apparently had
much larger recorded and unrecorded outflows of capital (and smaller
inflows) than in the first quarter, despite sizable temporary repatri-
ations of corporate funds at midyear.
In the first week or two of July much of the midyear re-
patriations of corporate funds seem to have been reversed. Apart from
that reversal, net flows of funds responding to exchange rate pros-
pects and interest rates may continue for a while to be much smaller
than before. There may be further movements into the Japanese yen,
and flurries such as the buying of French francs in the past two
weeks, but the German authorities aim at inducing further movements

I -9
out of the German mark--which should be helped by the fact that the -
exchange rate for the mark is now more than 5 per cent above its
par. The interest rate differentials between Eurodollar deposits
and comparable U. S. instruments--whether viewed as sources of funds
for banks or as outlets for short-term investments by nonbanks--are
now small enough to constitute far less of a threat to the U. S. pay-
ments position than they did earlier this year.
Even if there should be little net outflow of "liquid"
capital, the over-all deficit in coming months is likely to be large,
given the present outlook for merchandise trade and the possibility
that foreigners' purchases of U. S. securities may continue at a
relatively low level.

THE ECONOMIC PICTURE IN DETAIL
Domestic Nonfinancial Scene
Gross national product. GNP increased by $19.7 billion
in the second quarter according to preliminary OBE estimates--about
equal to the projection in the last Greenbook. In real terms, however,
the rise was somewhat stronger than projected--3.6 per cent--as the
rate of increase in the implicit GNP deflator slowed from 5.3 in the
first quarter to 4.2 per cent. The rate of increase of the fixed
weight deflator for private GNP also moderated, but only to a
4.9 per cent annual rate, about as projected.
A feature of second quarter GNP developments was the
surprising strength in consumer outlays, which rose by $15-1/2 billion;
consumer purchases of durable and nondurable goods each rose by $1.7
billion more than projected. Nevertheless, with disposable income up
sharply, in part because of the retroactive boost in Social Security
benefits, the saving rate, at 8.3 per cent (revised), remained extremely
high.1/
The additional strength in consumer demand became evident
only recently with the strong gain in June retail sales along with
upward revisions in sales for previous months. The increase in durables
occurred despite a slightly reduced rate of unit sales of domestic
cars. Sales of foreign cars continued to rise and demand for used
cars was strong. Apparently, there were also good gains in durable

goods sales at department stores. The rise in nondurables reflected
particularly large sales increases at general merchandise and depart-
ment stores, although all major groups of stores reported relatively
good gains.

Offsetting the unexpected strength in consumer demand was
a sharp deterioration of the net export position and a smaller than
projected rise in inventory investment. The Commerce Department esti-
mates that net exports dropped to virtually zero in the second
quarter from an upward revised level of over $4 billion in the firstI

II -3
quarter. Some recent figures for June suggest that second quarter
net exports may have been even weaker than the preliminary estimate.
The increase in inventory investment fell short of our projections by
$1-1/2 billion, reflecting an upward revision of about this amount in
the first quarter level. Steel stockpiling apparently peaked earlier
in the year than expected and slackened in the second quarter. Durable
goods manufacturers were also continuing to liquidate excess stocks of
in-process and finished goods in order to bring inventories into better
balance with sales.
Residential construction activity continued its upward course
with new private residential housing starts for the quarter totaling
1.95 million, annual rate, as we had projected. Business fixed invest-
ment also rose slightly more than expected, but outlays by State and
local governments fell short of the projected rise by about $.4
billion, following a sharp downward revision of their construction
expenditures in the first quarter.
We now expect a somewhat smaller GNP increase for the third
quarter--$19.0 billion rather than $21 billion, since it appears that
the military pay increase which we had assumed to take effect in July
will be delayed to the fourth quarter. This change alone reduces our
former projection of third quarter Federal purchases by over $2-1/2
billion. Nevertheless, we anticipate a strong gain in consumer outlays.
The improved showing of retail sales from March through June and a rise
in consumer confidence as reported in several surveys suggest a somewhat

II -4
healthier atmosphere in consumer markets, and some reduction in the
high saving rate shown by the revised GNP figures seems likely.
We continue to assume settlement of steel wage negotiations
without a strike. Other sectors of demand are projected about as in
the preceding Greenbook: a moderate further gain in residential con-
struction expenditures and a slightly larger increase than in the
last quarter in State and local outlays. Little increase is anticipated
in business fixed investment and a sizable decline is likely in net
inventory investment as a result of a run-off of excess steel stocks
and some downward adjustment of high auto inventories.
With a military pay raise now anticipated in October and an
improved tone in consumer markets, a somewhat stronger fourth quarter
appears in prospect. We are projecting an increase of $27-1/2 billion,
$5 billion more than formerly. The pay raise is projected to add
about $2-1/2 billion to Federal outlays, with the extra income expected
to augment consumption expenditures. Improved sales should also stim-
ulate a somewhat higher rate of inventory accumulation than we had
earlier projected.
For the second half as a whole, the somewhat more optimistic
outlook for consumer spending and inventory investment is reflected
in larger GNP gains. Projected real GNP growth is projected to average
3.8 per cent, annual rate, as compared to about 3-1/4 per cent projected
in the previous Greenbook. The modest real growth expected this quarter
(about 2-1/2 per cent, annual rate) is likely to be insufficient to

offset anticipated productivity gains and labor force growth and a
renewed rise in unemployment is expected to persist into the autumn.
But the additional strength now foreseen for late 1971 suggests that
the unemployment rate may level off below 6-1/2 per cent toward year
end.
A continued improvement in the rate of growth of real GNP
is still anticipated for the first half of next year. A rise in the
minimum wage, a scheduled increase in personal income tax exemptions,
and a prospective Federal pay raise--should further stimulate consumer

outlays. Another increase in Social Security benefits also seems likely.
We expect the additional buoyancy of the economy and the strength in
consumer outlays to be reflected in somewhat higher inventory invest-
ment than we had formerly projected. Increases in GNP in the first
half of 1972 are now expected to average almost $28 billion a quarter,
a rate of growth in real GNP of about 5-1/3 per cent--enough to cut
unemployment to around 6 per cent by mid-year.

II -7
With price increases continuing at a fairly brisk pace, and
little or no indication of moderation evident in wage settlements,
we have only scant hope for a significant easing of overall price
pressures. The annual rate of increase in the deflator is therefore
still projected at 4-1/2 per cent in the fourth quarter, edging down
only to 4-1/4 per cent by the second quarter of next year.

Industrial production. Industrial production rose 0.4 per
cent further in June and at 167.9 per cent was up 4 per cent from the
November 1970 strike-induced low and was 3.8 per cent below the 1969 pre-
recession peak.
Among those sectors showing output gains in June were home
goods (furniture, TV, some appliances, etc.), consumer staples, defense
equipment, and most materials. Production of autos was unchanged and
output of business equipment and steel declined.
Changes in the total index in July and August will depend
largely on curtailments now underway in the steel industry. The season-
al factor allows for a 12 per cent decline in steel output from June to
July and an increase of 3 per cent in August. In both May and June,
the total index excluding steel rose .8 of a point.

Retail sales. Consumer buying in June turned out substan-
tially higher than had been indicated by the weekly statistics. Total
retail sales increased 1.6 per cent from May, with all major groups of
stores participating in the rise. Durable goods sales increased 1.8 per
cent, with gains in the automotive group and some recovery in sales of
furniture and appliances. Nondurable sales increased 1.5 per cent, with
sales of the general merchandise group particularly buoyant.
Gains in June followed large upward revisions in the sales data
for March, April and May. These adjustments and the strong sales gain
in June raise the estimate for the second quarter to a level 7.5 per
cent above a year earlier, or about 3.8 per cent in real terms.

Sales in the second quarter as a whole were up 3-1/2 per cent
from the first quarter. Sales of durable goods were 5 per cent higher,
as gains in the automotive group offset by a wide margin a 1 per cent
decline in sales of furniture and appliances. Nondurable goods sales
rose by 3 per cent, led by a strong gain at department stores, although
all major groups of stores reported relatively large increases.
Unit auto sales. Sales of new domestic-type autos in the
first 10 days of July were at an annual rate of 7.1 million units, down
5 per cent from a year ago and 16 per cent below the rate of the first
6 months of 1971. In large part the decline probably reflected the
termination of several sales-incentive contests in the last selling
period of June.
Total foreign and domestic sales were at a 9.9 million unit
rate for June, up 4 per cent from a year earlier. The import share of
the U.S. auto market was 16 per cent in June, compared with 11 per cent
a year earlier. Economy class imports accounted for most of this in-
crease. The market share of domestic type small cars has also risen
substantially over the last year, while domestic type large cars ex-
perienced a decline.

Consumer credit. Consumer instalment credit outstanding in
May increased $5.9 billion, seasonally adjusted annual rate. This was
well below the $8.0 billion rate of April but more than double the
$2.7 billion rate in the first quarter. At the end of May total instal-
ment credit outstanding was $100.7 billion, an increase of only $3.0
billion from a year earlier.
Seasonally adjusted extensions of automobile credit declined
further in May after a small decrease in April. In part, the decline
in extensions reflected a smaller proportion of cars sold on credit
and a small decrease in the average size of contract on both new and
used cars. However, the average contract for new cars is still nearly
$200 higher than in the second half of 1970 (seasonally adjusted),
while used car contracts are about $100 higher.
Conference Board Consumer Survey. The May-June survey by the
Conference Board indicated a sharp conflict between consumer attitudes

II -14
and expressed intentions to purchase autos and major appliances. Atti-
tudes about the future turned less pessimistic last winter and this
improvement in expectations generally continued in both the March-April
and the May-June surveys, although pessimistic responses still outnumber
optimistic replies by far.
Buying intentions for autos and major appliances, on the
other hand, declined rather sharply in the latest survey, although they
had turned upward along with expectations in the January-February survey.
The percentage of families planning to buy an auto in the next six months
declined from 8.8 to 7.8 per cent of all households. The per cent of
households planning to purchase major appliances fell to 35.9 from 40.2
per cent in the last survey. Buying plans for homes remain at the high
3.1 per cent rate of the previous survey.
Experience at the Michigan Survey Research Center indicates
that attitudes generally have more predictive value for future expendi-
tures on consumer durables than explicit buying intentions for speci-
fic goods. This finding is particularly applicable when all attitudi-
nal questions move in the same direction, as was true in the latest
Conference Board Survey.

Inventories. The book value of business inventories rose at
a $7.6 billion annual rate in May, according to preliminary data--about
the same as in April and only slightly higher than in the first quarter.
About half of the inventory growth in April and May came from
steel stockpiling. But while durable goods manufacturers were building
stocks of materials, they liquidated stocks of other in-process and
finished goods, at a rate somewhat greater than in the first quarter.
Auto dealers continued to add to their inventories. Outside of these

II -16
major durable goods areas, there was an increase from the first quarter
in the rest of manufacturing and trade.

Sales increased along with inventories in April and May and
the inventory-sales ratio remained at 1.53 in May for the third month
in a row; this was lower than at any time in 1970, and about the same
as in May 1969 and the previous steel stockpiling period in May 1968.
Since January, inventory-sales ratios have shown marked improvement,
notably in durable goods manufacturing other than materials and in the
nondurable and miscellaneous durable group. Nevertheless, there are
signs of excess stocks in some categories. Inventories of steel mill
shapes were higher in May relative to steel use than in any previous
reported stockpiling period, according to data on tonnage which go
back to 1962. Auto dealers were carrying 59 days' supply of new domestic-
make autos in May and June, compared with 54 days' supply a year earlier.
Finally, the reduction in durable goods manufacturers' stocks other

II -17
than materials has not been as great as the decline in comparable un-
filled orders, and this inventory-backlog ratio has been rising.

Construction and real estate. The seasonally adjusted value
of new construction put in place in June was about unchanged from the
record May rate, according to preliminary Census estimates. At an esti-
mated annual rate of $103.5 billion in June, total construction activity
was 15 per cent above a year earlier in current dollar terms and 6 per
cent on a constant dollar basis.
There was a slight decline in June residential construction
outlays. However, in projecting the residential component for June,
Census under-estimated the June starts rate by some 80 thousand units.
Had it not been for this, residential outlays would have risen for the
tenth consecutive month in June and total construction would have ex-
ceeded the May rate.

Seasonally adjusted private housing starts edged up slightly
in June to an annual rate of 1,982 thousand units. For the second quar-
ter, starts averaged 1.95 million units--8 per cent above the first
quarter rate and more than 50 per cent higher than the low first and
second quarters of a year earlier. Single-family units, which provided
the major share of the second quarter starts advance, continued upward
in June to an annual rate of almost 1.2 million units.
With residential mortgage commitments and building permits at
extraordinarily high levels, some further increase in starts appears

II -19
likely over the near-term. While the rate of increase is expected to
slow, third quarter starts may well average in excess of a 2 million
unit rate for the first time in over two decades.

Personal income. Total personal income showed an unusually
large increase in June to an annual rate of $870 billion, reflecting
mainly the 10 per cent rise in Social Security benefit payments retro-
active to January 1. The increase in Social Security benefits accounted
for $16-3/4 billion of a total rise of over $20 billion, with the
retroactive payment amounting to $13-1/4 billion. Excluding the in-
creased Social Security payments, personal income advanced $3.5 billion,
compared with an increase of $5.4 billion in May.
The increase in wage and salary disbursements slowed somewhat
in June. Hours of work and hourly earnings continued to rise, but
there was a substantial drop in employment and disbursements increased
only $2 billion in June compared with a rise of $4.3 billion in May.
Manufacturing payrolls advanced only $0.5 billion, $1 billion less than
in May.
Labor market. Although the unemployment rate dropped from
6.2 per cent in May to 5.6 per cent in June, other evidence suggests
no substantial improvement in the labor market. Both the civilian
labor force and total employment declined sharply, the monthly rate of
insured unemployment rose, and the number of workers on nonagricultural
payrolls fell 310,000. The civilian labor force, seasonally adjusted,
dropped by over one million, with the bulk of the decline among younger
workers. Much of the drop in both unemployment and the civilian labor
force appeared to be due to seasonal adjustment difficulties and the
early enumeration week, which may have found a disproportionately large

II-21
number of young people still in school. Insured unemployment and
initial claims for unemployment benefits edged down in the early weeks
of July.
Declines in unemployment were concentrated among workers who
were either new entrants or re-entrants to the labor force, largely
teenagers and young adults (20-24). In addition to seasonal adjustment
problems, the declines apparently reflected the depressed state of the
labor market which may have discouraged many workers from looking for
jobs. Unemployment rates also moved downward moderately in June for
adults and other categories, such as whites and Negroes, and blue- and
white-collar workers.
The seasonally adjusted civilian labor force dropped from
84.2 million in May to 83.1 million in June. Since June 1970 the
civilian labor force has increased by 918,000, with over half the
increase occurring among young adult men, many of whom are returning
veterans. The total labor force, however, was up by only 554,000 from
June, 1970, about one-third of the "normal" growth anticipated from
population increases and long-run trends in participation rates.
The number of wage and salary workers on nonfarm payrolls
in June showed a less than seasonal increase, and as a result, seasonally
adjusted employment in most industrial categories declined. The largest
drop occurred in manufacturing, which fell 115,000 with much of the
reduction in the metal and metal using industries. Payroll employment
in trade was off 88,000, following a rise in May.

For the second quarter as a whole, nonfarm employment in-
creased only moderately after a relatively large first quarter gain
centered in trade. In manufacturing, first quarter employment expanded
slightly following the end of the GM strike but declined in the second
quarter.
Firmness in the workweek has continued to provide one
optimistic element in the labor market. Average weekly hours of pro-
duction and nonsupervisory workers on private payrolls rose 0.1 hour
in June to 37.1. In manufacturing the workweek rose 0.1 hour for the
second consecutive month and at 40.0 hours was up 0.4 hour from the
November trough. Typically, however, in previous recessions by six
months after the trough the manufacturing workweek had moved up by
about 1.0 hour.

Earnings. Wage increases have continued to be rapid. In
the second quarter of 1971 average hourly earnings of production workers
on private nonfarm payrolls were up 6.5 per cent from a year earlier.
In manufacturing and construction, the rise in earnings was larger than
in the comparable periods of the preceding two years, reflecting sizable
settlements in the current round of collective bargaining agreements.
In the service industries, however, there appears to be a modest easing
in the rate of wage increases.

Industrial relations. Some key strikes began this month
which are likely to have considerable impact on income and production
but because of timing their effect on payroll employment in July will
be relatively small. Close to half a million members of the Communi-
cation Workers Union who went on strike July 14 are scheduled to
return to work this week following agreement reached on a new three-
year contract. Exclusive of cost of living adjustments, we estimate
that wage and fringe benefits will rise by 22-1/2 per cent over the
life of the contract, or at an average annual rate of about 7 per cent.
This appears to be in line with package increases in the can, aluminum
and auto industries. The telephone settlement for the first time in-
cludes a cost-of-living escalator clause. The clause is effective in
the second and third contract years and provides for a 50-cent increase
in weekly wages for each 0.5 point rise in the CPI over a 12-month

II-25
period. This agreement is expected to set the pattern for contract
settlements with 200,000 electrical workers now negotiating with the
telephone company.
After prolonged negotiations on a national basis between
the railroads and the United Transportation Union on a new agreement
incorporating work rule changes recommended by a Presidential panel
in November, the union called a selective strike (ruled permissible
under a Supreme Court decision) against two railroads on July 16--
the Southern Railway and the Union Pacific, involving about 50,000
workers. Strikes against the Southern Pacific and Norfolk and Western
are scheduled for July 24 and for July 30 on the Sante Fe and five
smaller carriers. As they announced before the strike, carriers not
affected by the strike have put into effect the work rule changes under
negotiation. Layoffs of some workers have reportedly followed imposition
of the work rules.
Contracts expired in the copper industry and in West Coast
shipping on July 1 and over 50,000 workers have been on strike since
then. The first copper settlement was reached July 18 when Magma
Copper and 3,000 workers agreed to a wage package totaling 92 cents
over three years, an unlimited cost-of-living clause effective May 1972,
and a 50 per cent increase in pensions. This agreement has already set
the pattern for a tentative agreement at Anaconda Copper and is expected
to soon lead to settlements throughout the industry. In contract
negotiations between 19,000 West Coast longshoremen and the Pacific

II-26
Maritime Association there appears no likelihood of an early agreement;
a large wage increase and work guarantees are the main issues.
Collective bargaining in construction reaches a peak this
month. Judging from the data released by the President's Construction
Industry Stabilization Committee, collective bargaining agreements
approved by the Committee provide more moderate first-year wage and
benefit increases than were provided in major contracts negotiated in
1970, when the average first-year wage and benefit adjustment was over
19 per cent. Compared to 1970, there appear to be fewer increases of
25 per cent or more and many in the range from 7 to 13 per cent.
The postal unions reached a two-year agreement with the
U.S. Postal Service on July 20. The settlement provides for a limited
cost-of-living adjustment and a total wage increase of $1550 including
a one-time $300 bonus. The cost of the package is estimated at
$1 billion.
Important contract expirations in the near future include
steel (July 31), bituminous coal, East Coast shipping and aerospace
(all three on September 30); these key negotiations will involve over
half a million workers.
Wholesale prices. Wholesale prices rose at an annual rate
of 4.6 per cent in June, with substantial increases in industrial and
other prices. Rising prices for intermediate materials, particularly
for lumber and textiles, were mainly responsible for the 4.4 per cent
rise in industrials; finished goods prices contributed relatively
little, and crude materials declined. Since December, intermediate

II -27
materials, which account for more than one half of the weight of
industrial commodities, have risen at an annual rate of 5.5 per cent,
compared to only 2.3 per cent for finished goods. This reverses the
was
relation which/obtained in the second half of 1970. Over longer
periods of time, these two tend to move together, so that a more rapid
rise in finished goods prices may lie ahead.

The drop in crude materials, after previous rather brisk
increases, reflected declines in nonferrous and iron and steel scrap,
hides and skins and crude natural rubber. Prices of natural gas con-
tinued to rise.

II -28
Intermediate materials included increases in lumber and wood
products and in textiles, which have been showing considerable strength
after a long period of weakness. In addition to lumber, gypsum products
and other non-metallic building materials continued a strong advance.
Since last December, building materials have advanced at an annual
rate of over 12 per cent (unadjusted).
In the July WPI, industrial commodities will reflect the
mid-June and July 1 advances in steel sheet prices, but these will
be partly offset in the index by declines in steel scrap prices as mills
cut back production. Since the June pricing date, prices of tires for
passenger cars and trucks have been increased; prices of copper on out-
side markets have jumped as a result of the copper strike in the U.S.;
prices of nylon for apparel have been raised by an important producer,
and recent widespread increases in prices of nylon have been reported
in both the U.S. and Europe; and prices of 1972-model trucks, about
4 per cent higher than for comparably equipped 1971 models, were set
tentatively by a major producer.
In connection with the latter announcement, a comparison of
recent yearly changes indicates that truck prices have increased more
each year than have prices for passenger cars.

Increases in prices of fresh fruits and vegetables, grains,
and vegetable oils were in large part responsible for the rise in
the index of farm and food products. The outlook is now for bumper
crops if corn yields are normal. Indication of continued serious
blight are counterbalanced by the fact that about 60 per cent of
acreage is planted to resistant types and blends, and planted acreage
is 11 per cent larger this year than last.
GNP price indexes. The rise in the implicit GNP deflator
slowed from an annual rate of 5.4 per cent in the first quarter to
4.2 per cent in the second (preliminary), reflecting a less rapid
increase in prices in the private economy and a much smaller rise in
the deflator for Government purchases following the first quarter
Federal pay increase. This brought the rise in the GNP deflator to a
rate about 2 percentage points below that in the fourth quarter, when,

II -30
in addition to sharp prices advances, there was an adverse shift in
the composition of product. In that period, sales and output of
automobiles, which have a relatively low deflator, were greatly cur-
tailed because of the strike.

A more meaningful contour of price developments is revealed
by the fixed-weight index for private GNP which is not affected by
changes in composition of product; this index indicates that the rate
of price increase reached a high in the first quarter at an annual rate
of 5.6 per cent, but declined appreciably in the second quarter to
about the average rate of 1969 and 1970.
According to confidential data, prices for consumer goods
and services rose considerably less rapidly in the second quarter than
in the two previous periods. Durable goods rose relatively little,
since the record auto price increase of 1970-71 was fully reflected by

II -31
the end of the first period, and the rise in service costs was the
slowest since last year's third quarter.

Farm prospects. According to the July 1 report, acreage
planted to crops is 4 per cent larger than last year--in line with
planting plans reported in January and March but with a different mix of
crops. Far more corn, sorghum, and spring wheat and less oats, soybeans, and
flaxseed have been planted than pre-season intentions surveys had indicated.

Acreage of feed grains is up 8 per cent from last year. Corn
acreage is 11 per cent larger nationally. If blight damage to corn
yields is no greater than last year, it seems likely that feed grain
supplies will be adequate to meet domestic and foreign demands in the
year ahead and possibly permit a little rebuilding of stocks. Ample

food grain supplies are in prospect but soybean and cotton supplies
are likely to continue in close balance with demand.
According to the June pig crop report, more hogs are avail-
able for summer markets than had been expected and output for the
seasonally flush fall and winter markets will probably be down no more
than 2 to 3 per cent from last year. However, by early 1972, output
may dip below a year earlier by 7 to 8 per cent. A little more beef
is expected to be available than a year earlier through the rest of the
year reflecting larger marketings of fed cattle and cows. Average
slaughter cattle weights are expected to be a little lighter than last
year. The effect of these supply prospects on meat prices during the
rest of the year may be to moderate the usual midsummer rise in prices
and to limit the seasonal decline this fall. Higher pork prices are
likely in early 1972.

THE ECONOMIC PICTURE IN DETAIL
Domestic Financial Situation
Bank credit. Final estimates for June indicate that
commercial bank credit adjusted for loan transfers, increased at
a seasonally adjusted annual rate of about 10 per cent last month
(last Wednesday of month basis). A very sharp expansion in holdings
of U. S. Treasury securities accounted for the bulk of this increase,
reflecting bank participation in the Treasury's late-month financing
operation, on which banks received full tax and loan credit. An
unusually large volume of the 16-1/2 month notes sold in this
financing was acquired by smaller commercial banks, which apparently
found the 6 per cent coupon on the issue attractive. During the
first week in July, bank holdings of Treasury issues rose further,
reflecting acquisitions of the new September tax bill. Only a
minimal amount of the short-term notes acquired in late June were
sold in early July, suggesting that, as in the case of smaller banks,
large institutions' purchases of these securities were primarily for
their own account.

p -- preliminary.
r -- revised.
June acquisition of other securities (mainly State and local
notes and bonds and Federal agency issues) were well below those of
May and earlier months of the year. The rate of bank acquisitions
of municipal securities has been decelerating for several months,
presumably in reaction to uncertainty over the future course of interest
rates, particularly long-term rates; banks have been concentrating
their purchase on shorter-term issues in recent months.

III -3
Total loans increased only slightly in June after a very
strong advance in May. Business loans declined sharply over the
month, reversing a large part of the May increase. (There is some
thought that a major portion of the May advance was the result of
seasonal adjustment problems). Loans to nonbank financial institu-
tions also dropped substantially in June. Real estate loans, on
the other hand, rose very sharply and other major loan categories
increased moderately. The rise in real estate loans, one of the
largest monthly gains on record, was particularly strong in the
San Francisco District where housing starts have increased markedly
in recent months. Banks in California, facing large mortgage credit
demands, increased their mortgage rates by one half a percentage
point in early July.
The sharp drop in business loans in June reduced their rate
of growth in the second quarter to less than a 3 per cent annual
rate, and at mid-year business loans were only $200 million above
their year-ago level. Continued weakness in loan demands prevails
in various sections of the country, and, with the possible exception
of loans to public utilities and firms providing services, in all
industrial loan categories. Even loans to producers of machinery,
primary metals and other fabricated metals have not displayed any
strength in recent months despite the buildup in steel inventories.
Moreover, the net repayments of business loans in June, and a continued
apparent weakness in early July, occurred against the backdrop of develop-
ing moderation in capital market financing by businesses and a continued
net reduction of outstanding commercial paper issued by nonfinancial

III -4
corporations. These various developments taken together appear to
reflect--at least for large businesses--improved liquidity positions
and small present needs for working capital.
Available data suggest that essentially all of the weak-
ness in business loans in June occurred at the large banks, continuing
a trend in effect over the last year. A closer examination of bank
credit developments in the second half of 1970, made possible by
recently available benchmarks from call report data, indicates that
business loans at non-weekly reporting banks over this period were
quite strong in contrast to the very weak loan demand experienced
by large banks. This divergence often emerges in recession and
appears attributable to differences in the size of customer serviced
by the two groups of banks. The predominantly smaller customers
of smaller banks typically experience less pronounced movement in
sales and inventory positions. Furthermore, they must rely on
banks for their principal source of outside funds, while loan
customers of weekly reporting banks can tap the open markets for
funds; in the last year, large corporations have acquired funds in
the capital market in sufficient volume to pay down part of their
bank indebtedness.
Despite the recent weak business loan demands at large banks,
a one-half point increase in the prime rate to 6 per cent became general
in early July. This action was taken in response to the continued

III- 5
uptrend in open market rates, which had significantly raised the
cost of funds to banks. This prime rate increase has again made
banks a relatively more expensive source ofbborrowing than the
commercial paper market.
Monetary aggretates. M1 growth over the early part of July
continued quite strong, but interpretation of underlying trends is
difficult because of such factors as the quarterly OFDI reflow of
funds, the distribution of retroactive social security payments in
late June and the possible buildup in deposit balances in conjunction
with the July AT&T financing operation. In June, the pace of advance
in M1 had slowed to about a 9 per cent annual rate, below May's
very rapid rate of increase. Expansion of M1 over the second quarter--
at an 11.3 per cent annual rate--was higher than in the first quarter.
The second quarter expansion in M1 appears to have been fairly evenly
distributed both geographically and by class of bank, although the
distribution of the June growth was somewhat less even.

The pace of expansion in M2 and M3 also slowed to some
extent in June, primarily reflecting the more moderate advance in M1.
However, despite the stronger second quarter advance in M1, both M
and M3 increased at a pace considerably below that for the first
quarter, as inflows of interest-bearing deposits at thrift institu-
tions fell well short of the exceptional first quarter rate. By
historical standards, however, the recent growth rates still remained
quite high.
Growth in time and savings deposits at commercial banks in
June continued to be relatively strong despite the further rise in
yields on competing market instruments (see table below). While the
monthly rates of increase in time and savings deposits other than
large CD's over the second quarter are well below those for the first
quarter, the rate of inflow does not appear to have slowed signi-
ficantly as the quarter progressed. The explanation for the main-
tenance of these deposit inflows is not clear. However consumers'
savings rate have remained high and their demands for safe liquid
assets may have been sustained by uncertainty over the economic
outlook.

In early July, however, the inflows of time and savings deposits other
than large CD's did diminish. This perhaps reflects the temporary
impact of AT&T's sale of preferred stock rights, but there is no
indication of a parallel movement at nonbank institutions.
Bank sales of CD's over the month of June were about as
large as in May, with foreign official institutions again accounting
for a major share of the advance. Since the end of June, CD sales
have accelerated largely because a sizeable share of the proceeds
so far received from the AT&T financing have been invested in these
instruments. These latter CD sales have been concentrated in short-
term maturities, continuing the general trend underway in the second
quarter toward a shortening maturity of CD sales. At prime New York
City banks, the average maturity of CD sales declined to 1.7 months in
June from over 5 months in March, as corporate treasurers placed a
greater premium on short-term assets.

III -8
Nondeposit sources of funds increased on average in June
primarily as a result of increased bank borrowing from their foreign
branches. The increase early in the month appears to have been
attributable to bank bookkeeping practices and borrowing for the
purpose of maintaining reserve free borrowing bases. Such borrowing
was apparently sustained over the remainder of the month by relative
cost considerations, as the overnight Euro-dollar rate dropped
below the Federal funds rate and remained in this position over
most of the month. Since early July, however, the rate relation-
ship has been reversed and, in the early weeks of the month,
Euro-dollar borrowing declined.
Member banks also stepped up their borrowing from the
Federal Reserve Banks after mid-June and in the statement week
ended July 14, net borrowed reserves rose to $952 million, the
highest level in a year. Money market banks accounted for most of
the increase in borrowing, apparently in order to take advantage
of the relatively low discount rate at a time when such banks
generally have a "clean" record at the discount window.
Nonbank thrift institutions. Savings and loan associations
and mutual savings banks both experienced a relatively favorable
reinvestment period at the end of June and in early July. In both
cases, however, the deposit patterns relative to other reinvestment
periods earlier this year tended to confirm the modest slowdown in
the rate of growth that began in May, reflecting in part the rising

III -9
level of market yields relative to rates paid by the thrift institu-
tions. The AT&T rights issue that coincided with this reinvestment
period did not appear to induce withdrawals of unusually large
proportions.

During the month of June, deposit growth at the mutual
savings banks and the savings and loan associations was maintained
at the pace that was set in May. While that rate shows a reduction
from the exceptional pace of early 1971, it remains quite high
by any other standard,

increase in the prime rate announced earlier this month, there were

On long-term credit, average returns on home mortgates edged higher
again during June in both the primary and the secondary mortgage
market, although field reports suggest that funds remained in ample
supply in nearly all major areas. While gross yield spreads on home
mortgages improved somewhat in June relative to new issues of corporate
bonds, they continued quite unattractive to diversified lenders.Both

Discounts on Government-underwritten mortgages traded in
the secondary market reached as much as 7.2 points in June--the most
restrictive level in 1-1/2 years. Applications to FHA for mortgage
insurance and requests to VA for appraisals on existing houses in
June were running well below the unusually high seasonally adjusted
rates attained in the early spring, when discounts were at this year's1970

low. In contrast, similar activity on new homes has risen, as
builders have apparently been more willing or able to absorb,
or pass on, the increasing discounts than sellers of used homes.1/
As an alternative to relying on new low-downpayment
FHA and VA loans carrying these large discounts, recent field
reports indicate that assumptions of existing mortgages by used
home buyers have become more frequent in some areas and that more
used-home sellers have been taking back second mortgages in order
to minimize buyers' out-of-pocket investments. The further increase
in discounts on Government-underwritten mortgages during June
reinforced trade expectations that the contract interest rate on
such loans may soon be raised by administrative action above the
current 7 per cent ceiling.
In FNMA's latest regular auction (July 12), offers received
and bids accepted remained substantial. Discounts and implied yields
on forward commitments to purchase FHA and VA mortgages edged higher,
especially on 3-month commitments which have generally accounted for
the bulk of regular auction activity in the past few months. During
this period, many mortgage companies have held existing FHA and VA
mortgages in warehouse without firm investor purchase commitments,
awaiting more favorable prices. As mortgage prices have continued to

that occurred over most of this period and the prime rate increase
in early July. The immediate effect of the recent rise in the
discount rate was only a slight rise in corporate rates. Yields
on new high-grade corporate bonds in mid-July were about 25 basis
points lower than in mid-June; and, while one widely followed
index of tax-exempt yields is slightly above its mid-June level,
it has dropped 20 basis points from the June 24 peak.
Stock prices have partly recovered from the late June
decline. At the same time, combined NYSE and AMEX average daily
trading volume, although still high by historical standards, has
reached the lowest level recorded in 1971. Probably as a result
of this diminished volume, fails to deliver--the generally accepted

Public bond offerings in June reached a total of $2.3
billion, but the July volume now appears to be about $1.5 billion.
With this reduced supply, underwriters were relatively aggressive
in pricing new issues this month. However, in spite of reports
of ample availability of investable funds, institutional buyers
were reluctant to make purchases much below the 8 per cent yield
level.
Scheduled public utility offerings, which were unusually
light in July, will return to previously high levels over the next
few months; but there does appear to be a moderation in the volume
of industrial issues. The staff estimates that the August public
bond total will be no higher than $1.7 billion.
New stock issue volume in July was boosted by the $1.4
billion AT&T offering, but the staff expects that the usual summer
lull in market activity will be reflected in an August volume some-
what below the average for the first half of the year. Takedowns
of private placements in the summer months are expected to edge
up above the first-half average, since commitment activity has
been quite strong this year. Total sales of corporate securities in
both June and July are estimated to be about $4 billion, but the
July figure is distorted by the AT&T offering. In August, total
corporate security volume is expected to drop $1 billion.

As in the corporate market, the summer months are expected
to bring some tapering of the volume of tax-exempt debt offerings.
Current interest rate levels are undoubtedly restricting sales
of some revenue bonds and issues by lower-rated borrowers. But
even with a somewhat reduced volume of offerings, a significant
decline in yields is not likely to occur unless bank acquisitions
increase; commercial bank purchases have been slackening in recent
weeks and still appear to be mainly in the shorter maturities.

Government securities market. Yields in the Treasury note
and bond market have increased only moderately in the wake of the
rise in the discount rate, with long-term rates moving about 10
basis points higher and intermediate-term yields gaining about 15
basis points. In the Treasury bill market, rate increases have been
more pronounced, ranging from 10 to about 25 basis points--the 3-month
bill is now bid at about 5.50 per cent, compared with 5.38 per cent
just before the discount rate change and 5.22 per cent at the end
of June.

Prior to the discount rate increase, yields in the coupon
sector of the Treasury market had edged lower from their advanced level
reached in late June. Final investor demand was reportedly fairly
active, and with dealer inventories other than in rights relatively
low in anticipation of the August financing, prices were pushed
higher. The terms of the refunding, to be announced July 21, will
be outlined in the supplement.

Treasury bill rates were marked higher in late June as market
participants adopted a cautious attitude in the fact of uncertainty
about the eventual level of the prime rate and about a possible rise
in the discount rate. In addition, large foreign official sales
of bills weighed heavily on the market in an atmosphere of relatively
lackluster demand. As some of these factors abated, or--as in the
case of foreign official activity--were reversed, the market firmed
somewhat until the recent increase in the Federal funds and discount
rates.

In the market for Federal agency securities, issues since
the last meeting of the Committee have raised a net total of about
$1.0 billion in new money, compared with a net repayment of $0.2
billion in the preceding four weeks, and with a monthly average
repayment of $0.1 billion over the first five months of the year.
This amount included $400 million of an $850 million FNMA financing
at the end of June; and a Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation
offering of $150 million of 27-month notes and $150 million of
25-year bonds. The latter were priced to yield 7.75 per cent and
were reportedly very well received by the market.
Other short-term credit markets. Interest rates on short-
term instruments in the private credit markets were generally unchanged
to 1/8 of a percentage point higher between late June and mid-July.
Three-month commercial paper was yielding 6.00 per cent at mid-month--
the same as the new prime rate at commercial banks--while in late June
the commercial paper rate had been 38 basis points above the 5-1/2
per cent prime rate. The spread between Treasury bills and commercial
paper in the 3-month area was about unchanged during the first half
of July--at around 65 basis points--before bill rates started adjusting
to the discount rate hike.
Total commercial and finance company paper outstanding
declined about $700 million in June (seasonally adjusted) following a
$400 million drop in May. The change in nonbank related paper accounted

III -21
for almost all of the decline. During the first half of 1971, total
commercial and finance company paper fell by $3.5 billion to a level
of just over $30.0 billion.. Bank-related paper declined $0.6 billion
on balance to $1.7 billion over this period. Dealer-placed commercial
paper dropped by $1.7 billion, while finance company paper declined
by $1.2 billion.

Federal finance. With the exception of the draft (and
volunteer army) bill, which now calls for somewhat less spending
than the staff had assumed ($900 million less, at annual rate) and
the date of passage of which is still uncertain, there have been no
recent significant fiscal policy changes that have affected staff
estimates of receipts and expenditures. The recently passed public
service jobs bill had already been allowed for in staff estimates.
Our expenditure figures still include some provision for additional
social security benefits beginning with calendar 1972, although
Congressman Mills' proposed welfare and social security reform bill
(HR-1) only provides for additional benefits as of July 1972.
However, as a result of the recent OBE regular annual revision
of the income and product accounts for prior periods, staff projections
of receipts and expenditures on an NIA basis have been significantly
revised since the last Greenbook, to conform to the revised estimates of
the current periods which serve as the jumping off point for the
projections. A comparison of the staff's current and prior NIA projec-
tions is presented in the Table below.
The Commerce Department revisions lowered estimates of both
Federal receipts and expenditures for prior periods, and the revised
staff figures for FY 1971 and FY 1972 are correspondingly lower. Most
of the lowering of the staff's receipts figures reflect a downward
revision on the level of corporate profits tax accruals and in
personal receipts. Expenditures were revised downward less than

III -24
receipts so that the estimated deficit for fiscal 1971 and the projected
deficit for fiscal 1972 are now a little larger. While figures for
purchases of goods and services were lowered for fiscal years 1971
and 1972, figures for transfer payments to individuals in FY 1971
and to State and local governments in both fiscal years were revised
upward somewhat, resulting in a small net reduction in expenditure
figures.

The revision of NIA statistics also affected the staff
estimate of the high employment budget, as shown in the accompanying
table. Federal expenditures were revised downward. High employment
GNP and high employment Federal receipts were revised upward as a
result of an upward revision of the price deflator for past periods.

III -25
The result of these revisions, caused by the OBE revisions, is a
shift from estimated high employment deficits of negligible amounts
to significant surpluses. The revised staff estimate now also indicates
a small positive change in the high employment balance from fiscal
1971 to fiscal 1972 as a result of minor revisions in fiscal assump-
tions, Estimates of the high employment budget used by the OMB
and by the CEA differ from the staff's estimates because of
differences in accounting for price trends, the use of unified budget
rather than NIA basis, and other differences in assumptions and pro-
cedures.
The unified budget deficit for FY 1972 is now estimated
by the staff to be $23.4 billion. Newspaper reports indicate that
the Joint Committee on Internal Revenue Taxation is projecting a
deficit of $23.1 billion, and that the Office of Management and
Budget is speaking in terms of a deficit of $20 and $25 billion or
even as high as $35 billion. On the basis of present Administration
programs and Congressional action, the staff knows of no justification
for estimates as high as the latter figure.
The lawsuit against the Treasury's liberalized depreciation
regulations may be reducing the anticipated impact of that measure.
Many observers, despite the high actual projections of the budget
deficit, are urging various quick-acting, self-limiting stimulative
fiscal measures. At least two bills have been introduced that propose
the adoption, retroactive to January 1, 1971, of tax relief measures

III -26
that had been scheduled for 1972 and 1973--the increase in personal
exemptions, increases in the standard deduction, and imposition of
a 50 per cent ceiling rate on earned income. Other proposals, made
at hearings of the House Ways and Means Committee, include special
emergency grants to states and localities, extension of the unemploy-
ment benefit period, postponement of the scheduled increase in the
social security wage base, and the unfreezing of certain appropriated
funds.
The present cash balance projections assume no new financing,
except for the already-scheduled increases in weekly 3-month bill
offerings, until August 16, when net new money of $2.5 billion is
expected. However, borrowing of this size would give an unusually
low estimate--$4.4 billion--for the end-of-August balance.

THE ECONOMIC PICTURE IN DETAIL
International Developments
U.S. balance of payments. Preliminary data indicate that
the adjusted liquidity deficit in the second quarter 1/ was about
$5-3/4 billion, seasonally adjusted. Monthly figures, not seasonally
adjusted, show large deficits in April and especially May, followed
by a moderate surplus in June which reflected quarter-end repatriations
of funds by U.S. corporations in compliance with the controls on direct
investments abroad. There was a large deficit in the first week of
July as the window-dressing was reversed.
The liquidity deficit in the second quarter was about
$2-3/4 billion larger than the first-quarter deficit. Nearly half
of this worsening resulted from a deterioration in our trade balance --
from a surplus of $300 million in the first quarter to a deficit of
about $1 billion in the second quarter, as described below. The
remainder of the worsening was mainly in capital flows influenced by
expectations of exchange rate changes. A major element contributing
to the larger second quarter deficit was an increase in bank-
reported claims on foreigners, much of which occurred during early
May.
1/ Measured by financing items: changes in reserve assets, all
liabilities to foreign official reserve agencies, and liquid liabilities
to commercial banks and other foreigners.

IV -2
Foreign purchases of new issues sold abroad by U.S. corporations to
finance their foreign investments were markedly lower than the high
level of sales recorded in the first quarter, while purchases of
U.S. corporate stocks probably were down from the already-low first
quarter amount.
These identified transactions account for about 80 per cent
of the increase in the adjusted liquidity deficit. It seems likely
that there was also a further increase in the large negative errors
and omissions item.
On the official settlements basis, the seasonally adjusted
deficit in the second quarter is estimated to have been about $6
billion, only slightly higher than in the first quarter. Whereas
in the first quarter net repayments of liabilities to banks abroad
had amounted to $3 billion, in the second quarter there was a decrease
of only about $1/4 billion in such liabilities. This improvement
offset most of the worsening in trade and other capital transactions.
The deficit on the official settlement basis for the second
quarter -- estimated at $6.4 billion before seasonal adjustment --
was financed by an increase of about $5.6 billion in liabilities to
foreign official reserve holders and a decline of $.8 billion in
U.S. monetary reserves. The first quarter deficit on this basis had
amounted to $5.4 billion; liabilities to foreign official institutions
had increased $4.5 billion while U.S. monetary reserves declined
$.9 billion.

IV -3
Although the total decline in monetary reserves was about
the same in both quarters, gold and SDR sales were larger in the
second quarter when there was a large sale of gold to France for
payment to the IMF. U.S. reserve holdings of convertible currencies
declined in the first quarter, reflecting principally British repurchases
of guaranteed sterling, and rose slightly in the second. The U.S.
reserve portion in the Fund declined in both quarters.
Changes in liabilities to foreign official reserve holders
are shown in the table. Germany's reserve holdings in this country
increased by about $3 billion in April and May, but declined by more
than $2 billion in June.

U.S. foreign trade. Partial data indicate another large
trade deficit in June -- the third successive month in which imports
have exceeded exports. Imports in June are estimated to have been
about equal to the high May value, while exports appear to have declined
moderately. For the second quarter, it is estimated that the trade
balance was a deficit of almost $1 billion (balance of payments basis) --
i.e., $3-1/2 billion, annual rate. This compares with a surplus at
an annual rate of $1.1 billion in the first quarter, and is about twice
as large as the deficit projected for the second quarter at the time
of the last Committee meeting.
The emergence of a heavy trade deficit in the second quarter
resulted from a very sharp acceleration in the rate of expansion
of imports, while exports fell back after a bulge in the first quarter.

per cent in the first quarter. This strength in imports appears to
be attributable only in part to such temporary factors as hedgebuying
of steel and aluminum, advance shipments prior to the imposition of
"voluntary" restrictions by foreign countries on exports to the
United States, and perhaps accelerated purchases in anticipation of
an East Coast dock strike threatened for October. Whether the current
dock strike at West Coast ports was a factor in the extremely heavy
arrivals of cars and other products from Japan in the second quarter is
hard to judge, since slack demand within the Japanese economy would
tend to produce the same result. There is no indication from the data
on copper imports in April-May to suggest much buying of imported copper
in advance of the present work stoppage in that industry.
Commodity details for June are not available. In April-May,
the strong increase in imports included not only a further advance in
automobiles, and other nonfood durable consumer goods of all types --
the major categories accounting for the import rise in the first quarter--
but also a decided pickup in arrivals of foodstuffs and industrial
materials. There was a very sharp increase in arrivals of petroleum
attributable to the easing in tanker rates and to more liberal quotas.
Imports of lumber and plywood also advanced as housing starts remained
high and domestic production turned up. Steel imports in April-May were
high, but no higher than in the first quarter. Heavy coffee arrivals are
believed to reflect, to some degree, early purchases in anticipation of
a possible dock strike this fall.

IV -6
The decline in exports in April-May brought them back down
to only slightly above the average level (in value) of the second half
of 1970. The decline, particularly in machinery and industrial materials,
can be attributed in part to the slowing in growth of economic activity
abroad. In addition, as indicated in the last Green Book, the U.S. share
of world trade in manufactured goods declined further in the first quarter.
Shipments of agricultural commodities peaked in the first
quarter and the April-May decline in such exports reflects prospects for
better harvests abroad, and possibly a shortage in U.S. supplies of raw
cotton, for which world demand is relatively strong. A further decline
in exports of agricultural commodities is anticipated. Deliveries of
commercial aircraft in April-May were unexpectedly strong, holding
at the very high first quarter level, but June exports are estimated to
have fallen off sharply. Schedules call for a much lower rate of aircraft
deliveries in the second half of the year.
Since total exports are no longer being buoyed up by rising
shipments of agricultural commodities and commercial aircraft, the
projected improvement in U.S. exports during the remainder of the year
rests on the hope of a much more decided expansion in growth abroad,
especially in Canada and Japan, than has been displayed so far this year.
Euro-dollar market. The spread between interest rates in the
United States and the Euro-dollar market (except that for day-to-day
money) narrowed further between late June and the third week of July,

IV -7
as Euro-dollar rates continued to recede from their 1971 peak levels
reached in the midst of foreign exchange market speculation in early
May.
One- and three-month Euro-dollar rates have declined to about
6 and 6-1/4 per cent, respectively, in recent days, reducing the
excess of these rates over the cost of domestic CD funds to U.S. banks
to about 1/4 to 1/2 per cent (compared to excess costs of more than
2 per cent on average in late May and early June). Before the quarter-
end a large amount of the funds moving out of German marks was apparently
going temporarily into the over-night Euro-dollar market -- where rates
averaged about 1/2 per cent below the Federal funds rate in the three
weeks through June 30. Since the quarter-end the overnight Euro-dollar
market has firmed and rates have been about equal to or slightly above
the Federal funds rate on average.

Liabilities of U.S. banks to their foreign branches declined
$0.8 billion to a total of $1.5 billion from June 23 to 30, in reaction
to normal quarter-end positioning by various market participants,
including repatriations by American companies under OFDI guidelines.
These liabilities rose by about $0.6 billion in the following week;
as of July 20 (the last date for which data are available as of this
writing) these liabilities had declined to about $1.7 billion. Over
the thirteen weeks of the second quarter -- from March 31 to June 30 --
liabilities to foreign branches plus branch holdings of special
Ex-Im and Treasury securities showed little net change; U.S. banks'
liabilities to other foreign banks showed a small net decline.
On the basis of partial data it is estimated that in the
four week Euro-dollar reserve requirement computation period ended
July 7 U.S. banks' Euro-dollar borrowings plus their foreign branches'
holdings of special Ex-Im and Treasury securities averaged roughly
$400 million above the previous four-week period. This increase in
average positions probably reflected the favorable terms on which
U.S. banks could obtain funds in the over-night Euro-dollar market
during that four-week period. The increase need not have involved
any increase in required reserves, as most banks had reserve-free
bases in excess of liabilities to branches because of special
security holdings.

IV -9
Foreign exchange markets. Following several weeks of
relative calm, the foreign exchange markets in July experienced
renewed tensions, with the dollar weakening against most major foreign
currencies. The Bank of France purchased $783 million in the first 16
days of July, mainly as a result of a flurry of speculation on a
possible franc revaluation. The German mark advanced to a new high
5.6 per cent above parity, but the Bundesbank's dollar sales have
slowed substantially from the June pace. The Japanese yen remained in
excess demand at the ceiling rate, and the Bank of Japan purchased
$566 million in the first three weeks of July. Several other European
currencies also firmed sharply against the dollar.
The movement into francs appeared to be based upon speculation
by some market participants that Germany and France might have reached
some sort of agreement whereby new parities for the mark and the franc
(as well as other EEC currencies) would be established prior to the
adoption of a wider band for the EEC currencies as a group vis-a-vis
the dollar, or that even if the franc were not revalued it would appreciate
after the wider band was adopted. The Bank of France purchased just over
$400 million in the week of July 12-16, but the franc subsequently slipped
below its ceiling as speculative fervor abated, and the central bank has
not intervened since July 16.
The German mark firmed very sharply after July 14 when the
Bundesbank offered for the first time to sell dollars at a price lower

IV -10
than DM 3.50 (equivalent to a price for marks 4.6 per cent above
parity). German authorities had apparently not been satisfied with the
amounts of dollars they had been able to sell above the 3.50 level, in
the face of some $2.1 billion coming into German reserves in July as
forward contracts mature. As the Bundesbank raised its bid price for
dollars, the market tended to move away from that rate, and the DM advanced
as high as 5.6 per cent over par, At rates that high, the Bundesbank
was unwilling to intervene, and has, in fact, sold only $230 million
since it abandoned the 3.50 intervention rate. Forward contract
maturities this month up to the 20th have been $1-1/4 billion and spot
sales $1.0 billion.
Other European currencies, particularly the guilder and the
Swiss franc, firmed in sympathy with the mark. The Belgian franc moved
to its ceiling, possibly reflecting some spillover of the speculation
in French francs, and the National Bank purchased some $40 million.
Sterling held fairly steady in the mid-241.30's, and the Bank of
England has not intervened in the spot market so far this month.
In official transactions this month, the System drew
$40 million equivalent on the swap facility with the National Bank
of Belgium, raising outstanding indebtedness on that line to $380
million. The U.S. Treasury sold $100 million equivalent of SDRs
to the Netherlands and $50 million equivalent of gold to Switzerland.

IV -11
In August the U.K. and France will be repaying $638 million and
$600 million equivalent, respectively, to the IMF. France has already
notified the U.S. Treasury of its intention to purchase the $191 million
in gold required for its Fund repayment. Both Britain and France
will have to obtain large quantities of various foreign currencies
by direct purchase (for dollars) from foreign central banks, and it
is likely that some of those banks will demand U.S. reserve assets
in exchange for their increased dollar holdings.

IV -12
Reserves and payments balances of major industrial countries.
The main industrial countries outside the United States, taken as a
group, continued to increase their official reserves at a very rapid
rate in the first four months of this year, even before the large
speculative inflows of May. Nine European countries, together with
Canada and Japan, recorded increases in net official reserves totalling
$6.4 billion (excluding SDR allocations). This figure rises to $8.4
billion after adjustment for the effects on reserves of the unwinding
early in January of year-end repatriations by Swiss and German banks.
Germany accounted for nearly one-half of the adjusted total.
The magnitude of the reserve gains of countries other than
Germany may have contributed marginally to the foreign exchange crisis
of early May which centered mainly on the exchange rate of the German
mark against the dollar. Because of the persistent balance of payments
deficit of the United States, and continued nervousness about the dollar,
these countries' large combined reserve gains may have led to more specu-
lative purchases of German marks and certain other currencies than other-
wise would have been the case, thereby intensifying the immediate pressures
on the exchange rates of these currencies.
Conditions in Germany itself, however, far more than any general
weakness of the dollar, were the underlying cause of the German government's
decision to float the mark on May 9. Heavy reserve gains -- $3 billion
in January-April -- stemming mostly from foreign borrowing by German
business enterprises, blunted the effectiveness of Germany's anti-inflationary

IV -13
monetary policy. When reserve gains were further swollen by massive
speculative and hedging inflows in early May the German authorities
felt that control over monetary conditions would be intolerably diffi-
cult. The Netherlands, Belgium, and Switzerland also experienced heavy
speculative inflows in early May. These countries, along with Austria,
were greatly affected by the German exchange rate action because their
imports from Germany are large in relation to the total supply of goods
and services in their economies. It was the inflow of private capital
to Germany that, by inducing the floating of the mark, was the dominant

factor touching off a floating of the Dutch guilder and revaluations

The major implications of the events of May for payments
balances of the leading industrial nations cannot be seen at this
time, if only because of the uncertainty over the future exchange rate
levels of the mark and the guilder. In Germany, where the floating (but

not freely floating) mark has risen to a premium of more than 5 per
cent over the official parity, the Bundesbank has encouraged an outflow
of funds; and some of the early-May speculative inflow into Swiss francs
has been reversed. In other European countries, developments since the
May crisis have been mixed, The United Kingdom and France have had
further large reserve gains; in July there has been speculation on an
appreciation of the French franc. But Italy, Belgium, and the Netherlands
registered appreciable reserve declines in June, all for reasons not yet
fully evident. Outside Europe, Japan has incurred very large reserve
gains because of a rapidly growing trade surplus coupled with intense
speculation on a yen revaluation in the past two and one-half months.
The Canadian dollar, which has floated since June 1, 1970, has recently
lost some strength.
Germany's balance of payments surplus in January-April was
$4.4 billion as measured by the increase in official and commercial
bank net foreign assets, and of this amount $4.1 billion was accounted
for by recorded net short-term borrowing by German firms and positive
net errors and omissions. The likelihood that the conduct of monetary
policy would continue, in the immediate future, to be seriously hindered
by capital inflows was a main source of expectations of an exchange rate
adjustment. A second factor was the continued strength of the trade
account and the consequent expectation that any decided slowing of
economic expansion in Germany would mean the emergence of a big current
account surplus. The trade surplus has not contracted despite the 1969

IV -16
mark revaluation and boom conditions in Germany, and the current
account as a whole was about in equilibrium in the first five months
of this year. The trade surplus in January-April was $3.7 billion at
a seasonally adjusted annual rate, and was 13 per cent greater than a
year earlier.
Official reserve gains of $2.2 billion in the first five days
of May preceded a temporary suspension of official foreign exchange
transactions and the move to a floating rate. After the mark was
allowed to float, there was no official intervention in the exchange
market in May, but since the beginning of June the Bundesbank has
offered dollars in the exchange market, at an increasingly attractive
rate, in order to syphon liquid funds from the economy and deplete
bank reserves. By July 20 the exchange rate of the mark was 28.77
cents, 5.3 per cent above parity. Official reserves fell $2.2 billion
in June, certainly in reflection of an exodus of hedgers' and speculators'
funds but also reflecting some repayments of earlier borrowings by German
companies. In the first 20 days of July, reserves rose an estimated
$250 million because Bundesbank spot dollar sales of $1.01 billion were
exceeded by $1.26 billion of maturing forward purchases.
The Netherlands' overall surplus in the first four months was
at a higher annual rate than in 1970 because an increase in the net
capital inflow outweighed an increase in the current account deficit,
which latter is now projected to exceed $400 million for 1971 as a whole.
The dependence of the overall surplus on short- and long-term capital

IV -17
imports made Dutch officials believe the guilder was not undervalued.
The decision to float the exchange rate can be viewed as a move to end
disruptive speculative inflows and to offset some part of the price-
raising effects of an appreciation of the mark. In May, reserves rose
$340 million before the guilder was floated. Since then, the Netherlands
Bank has not intervened in the exchange market, but has made deliveries
of dollars on maturing forward contracts with Dutch banks. The exchange
rate is currently about 2 per cent above the official parity.
The balance of payments of Belgium-Luxembourg has continued
strong this year. Official net foreign assets rose $443 million in
January-May (excluding SDR allocations), exceeding the balance of pay-
ments surplus by a wide margin because commercial banks were net importers
of funds. In June official net foreign assets declined $106 million
even though there were only a reported $12 million of central bank inter-
vention sales; Belgium may have made a net payment to the Common Market
Agricultural Fund. The speculative inflows of early May and the German
and Dutch exchange rate actions induced the Belgians to revise the regu-
lations pertaining to flows of funds through the official and free
exchange markets. This move will prevent inward as well as outward
net capital flows of any large size other than shifts in leads and lags,
but will not reduce the overall surplus, which has been solely on current
account.
In Switzerland the balance of payments surplus, already very
large in 1970, increased further to $742 million in the first quarter.

IV -18
The current account is believed to have been about in equilibrium, and
the overall surplus has been the consequence of a large net capital
inflow. The Swiss decision to revalue by 7.07 per cent, while essen-
tially a defensive, anti-inflationary measure, was also justified on
balance of payments grounds. In the past decade the overall balance
of payments has been in surplus in most years. The May rise of $162
million in official net foreign assets was the net result of a speculative
inflow of nearly $700 million early in May, the subsequent outflow of
about $300 million of those funds, and the swapping out of $250 million
to Swiss commercial banks to reduce their liquidity. In June the BNS
had intervention losses of $100 million; official reserves rose solely
because of quarter-end inward swaps, which were reversed in July.
The United Kingdom, France, and Italy were relatively little
affected by the May crisis, but their balances of payments will benefit
from the appreciations of other currencies. In Britain the balance of
payments surplus increased sharply in the first quarter, to $1 billion
as measured by the change in official and commercial bank net foreign
assets and $1.5 billion as measured by the change in offical assets alone.
Interest rate differentials favorable to short-term sterling assets as
compared with Eurodollar deposits (on an uncovered basis) contributed
to large short-term capital inflows, and positive errors and omissions
were huge, totalling over $900 million. The current account remained in
surplus ($185 million). The months April and May together showed a
relatively minor deficit, but in June the Bank of England's intervention

IV -19
gains were about $600 million. Official net foreign assets rose only
$107 million in June; the Bank of England apparently swapped out large
amounts of dollars. The current account surplus in the second quarter
was probably $400 to $500 million. The trade balance has not shown any
clear trend this year.
The balance of payments of France showed a $280 million surplus
in January-April, and official net foreign assets increased a further
$544 million in May-June. In the first 20 days of July the Bank of
France had intervention gains of $783 million, the franc being strengthened
by rumors of an exchange rate appreciation which would appear to be highly
unlikely despite the present state of the French external accounts. Since
the third quarter of 1970 there has been a decided improvement in the
trade balance notwithstanding a faster expansion of domestic economic
activity, but the overall surplus has continued to be a product of capital
inflows rather than a surplus on current account.
The Italian balance of payments has remained strong this year
in the face of continuing strikes, social tensions, political uncertainties,
and easing monetary conditions. The trade balance has not undergone any
important change this year. A $585 million overall surplus in the first
five months reflected both a continuing large net inflow of capital and
a current account surplus that is still substantial (in 1970 it was over
$800 million on the transactions basis). A recorded net capital inflow
of $740 million in January-April presumably overstates the actual inflow,
since it omits trade credits; for all of last year there was a net outflow

IV -20
on trade credits of over $650 million. In January-May Italian companies
borrowed a further $540 million in the Euro-bond market and in Eurodollar
bank loans. A drop in Italian official reserves in June reflected inter
alia a $61 million payment to the Common Market Agricultural Fund.
The rapidity with which Japan's balance of payments surplus has
increased this year has been striking. As measured by the change in official
plus commercial bank net foreign assets, Japan recorded a surplus of $2.9
billion in the first half of this year, compared with an even balance a
year earlier. A trade surplus (imports f.o.b., payments basis) of $2.86
billion was twice as large as in the first half of 1970, the rise in export
receipts accelerating somewhat to 24 per cent and the increase in import
payments falling sharply to only 9 per cent. Because of the slowdown in
Japanese economic activity in the past year, seasonally-adjusted imports
(customs basis) underwent an actual decline from the third quarter of 1970
to May 1971.
Speculation that the yen might be revalued, kindled by the
anticipation and materialization of exchange rate changes in Europe, was
the main factor in swelling the payments surplus to about $1.2 billion
in May and $700 million in June. The long-term capital, short-term capital,
and errors and omissions accounts produced net inflows of $760 million in
May and $192 million in June, compared with a monthly average of about $40
million in the preceding four months. Net purchases of Japanese stocks by
foreigners, which averaged $125 million a month in January-April, are
reported to have risen to $208 million in May and were $130 million in June.

IV -21
The rise of $678 million in official net foreign assets in June fell
short of reported Bank of Japan intervention gains of over $1 billion,
perhaps because of additional deposits of dollars by the Finance Ministry
with Japanese commercial banks. When the Ministry resumed making such
deposits last March it was thought they might amount to $800 million in
the ensuing several months. Bank of Japan intervention gains were $566
million in the first 20 days of July.
Effective August 10, the Bank of Japan will abolish its
preferential lending rates for export finance. The export finance rates
will be raised in most instances, and unified at a level equal to the
basic discount rate (currently 5.5 per cent).
On July 1 Japan liberalized the regulations governing purchase
of foreign shares and real estate by Japanese nationals. At the same
time, to reduce Japan's bilateral trade surplus with the United States,
the government instructed five major industries (autos, color TV sets,
desk-type electronic calculators, iron and steel, and cosmetics) to
restrain their exports to the United States and to adjust upward the
prices charged to foreign buyers of most of these products.
The external position of Canada strengthened further in the
early months of this year. The Canadian dollar rose on the exchange
markets during the first quarter before levelling off at around 99 U.S.
cents in April and May. The Bank of Canada moderated upward pressures
on the rate by buying moderate amounts of U.S. dollars, mostly in February
and in May. On a seasonally adjusted basis the trade surplus has declined

IV -22
somewhat from late 1970 levels but has remained very large by historical
standards. Imports, which declined in the fourth quarter of 1970, picked
up quite sharply during the first quarter of this year. The Canadian
dollar exchange rate declined in June to around 97-3/4 U.S. cents but in
recent days has advanced slightly to about 98 U.S. cents. The rate
decline in June can probably be related in part to the presentation of
a quite expansionary federal budget for fiscal 1972.
