SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK
Nonfinancial
Prior to the President's announcement of a new and far-
ranging economic program on August 15, incoming economic news had been
on the disappointing side. The labor market had continued weak and
industrial production declined appreciably in July; a rapid rate of
increase had resumed for both consumer and wholesale industrial prices,
and the foreign trade balance had deteriorated greatly.
The decline in industrial production in July was close to
1 per cent, bringing the index to 5 per cent below the 1969 high. A
further sizable reduction still seems in prospect for August--mainly
because of sharp cutbacks in output of steel. New orders for durable
goods edged down in June, with orders for capital equipment remaining
at about the same level that has prevailed since late last year.
Although the overall inventory-sales ratio declined in June to the
lowest point in almost five years--as total business sales rose faster
than book value of stocks--the ratio of inventories to unfilled orders
at durable goods manufacturers rose further to a new high.
After a strong showing in June, retail sales declined about
1 per cent in July, according to the advance estimate, but remained at
the advanced second quarter average. Sales of new domestic-type autos
in early August were at just over 8 million units, annual rate--about
the same as for the year to date. An exception to the sluggishness
prevailing in most major demand sectors was the sharp rise in housing

I-2
starts in July to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2.2 million
units from the 2 million rate in June.
Nonfarm payroll employment showed a large decline in July
for the second consecutive month. The bulk of the drop was accounted
for by manufacturing, but weakness in labor demand was widespread.
The unemployment rate rose to 5.8 per cent in July from 5.6 per cent
in June. A rise had been expected since the sharp decline in June
was apparently attributable in part to technical problems of measure-
ment. Although the civilian labor force increased sharply, it did
not rise above the level of last January.
In July, seasonally adjusted wholesale prices of industrial
commodities posted the largest rise in almost five years, following
sizable increases over the previous three months. A number of announce-
ments of forthcoming price increases were made in important industries
after the July pricing date, but most of these cannot now go into
effect--at least until after the expiration of the wage-price freeze.
Prices of farm products and foods declined sharply in July, and very
large supplies are in prospect.
Revised Commerce estimates indicate that real GNP increased
at an annual rate of 4 per cent in the second quarter, compared with a
preliminary estimate of 3.6 per cent. Net exports for the second
quarter were revised down by $2.3 billion, but there were compensating
increases in a number of other components of GNP.
Outlook. The staff has not had time to evalute the probable
response of the economy to the policy actions announced by the President.

I-3
Because of time constraints and numerous uncertainties about which we
are still making judgments, GNP projections are not shown in this
Greenbook but are planned to be presented for the last two quarters
of this year in the Supplement.
Our present tentative assessment is that expansion in real
GNP will be stimulated significantly. The initial stimulus to greater
production should be evident in the fourth quarter, and seems likely
to center in largerdemands for U.S.-type cars. Price increases for
1972 models have been rescinded; the excise tax reduction will result
in an appreciable drop in new car prices, while imported cars will
become relatively more expensive because of the import surcharge.
Our GNP projection is being based on the assumption that
the 90-day price-wage freeze will be effective, although some upcreep
seems inevitable. Another assumption is that the freeze will be
followed by resumption of wage and price increases, but at significantly
lower rates than prevailed so far this year, although there may be an
interval of some catch-up in the closing weeks of 1971. We also assume
no new major strikes the rest of this year.

I-4
Financial
Financial market participants reacted favorably to announcement
of the President's new economic package. Demand for fixed income
securities and equities increased sharply during the first two trading
days following the President's speech; short-term yields declined 10
to 40 basis points, long-term yields dropped 40 to over 60 basis points,
and stock prices rose very sharply on record volume.
Just prior to the President's speech, market concerns about
inflation prospects, exchange market developments, and monetary policy
had kept interest rates steady to somewhat higher,despite a continued
ample supply of investible funds and declining credit demands. Business
credit demand at banks and in the commercial paper market remained
modest in July and corporate bond offerings declined to the lowest level
in over a year. While the volume of State and local bond offerings
continued large, casualty insurance companies maintained and banks
stepped-up their acquisitions of such issues. Treasury and Agency
financings in July and early August were well received.
Deposit inflows at nonbank thrift institutions were large
again in July, and apparently continued strong in early August; whereas
similar inflows at commercial banks weakened generally. This contrasting
performance apparently reflects both the higher rate ceilings at non-
bank institutions and a failure of banks to seek consumer-type deposits
aggressively in light of their ample portfolio liquidity and weak loan
demand.

I-5
Mortgage rates continued to rise in July, in sympathy with
other market rates. Early in August, however, the President decided
to maintain the 7 per cent rate ceilings on FHA and VA mortgagesdespite
the near-record discounts recently prevailing on such obligations.
The plan is to use GNMA funds to subsidize a number of the discount
points on certain types of FHA/VA mortgages.
Outlook. The President's program helped to dissipate the
earlier market uncertainties regarding inflationary pressures, in-
ternational financial developments, and the likely thrust of monetary
policy. As a result, expectations now seem more likely to reinforce
the pressures of underlying supply-demand forces toward lower interest
rates--particularly in long-term markets.
In the months immediately ahead, the President's program
seems unlikely to add significantly to business demands for credit.
From now until early fall, inventory accumulation is expected to be
modest, plant and equipment outlays sluggish, and internal funds
generation improved; these factors should keep business credit demands
at banks and in the commercial paper market relatively small. More-
over, with a long period of balance sheet restructuring already behind
us, the preceding factors can also be expected to lead to a continued
slower pace of public bond offerings by corporations.
The volume of tax exempt bond issues is also likely to
slacken. And banks--facing weak loan demands--are likely to continue

I -6
to absorb a significant share of such offerings. Demands for tax
exempts should remain large on the part of fire and casualty insurance
companies, as well, since their insurance underwriting experience has
been unusually profitable this year.
Treasury demands over the remainder of the calendar year
will be very large, but the timing of such offerings is less clear.
Most of the scheduled debt expansion for the current quarter has
been completed. The magnitude of the fourth quarter financing will be
somewhat affected by Congressional actions on the fiscal elements
of the President's program, as well as by any net redemptions of
special Treasury issues held by foreign central banks. Debt offerings
of the Federal housing finance agencies are projected to rise,
but the precise financing pattern for such issuers is also subject
to some doubt until the implications of the GNMA subsidy program
are clarified.
In deposit markets, a continuation of lower short-term market
rates could sustain the high pace of savings inflows to nonbank thrift
institutions and reverse the slowing of flows to commercial banks.
Thus, it appears likely that deposit flows will be sufficient to
assure a continued large supply of mortgage funds. If the high cost
of Euro-dollars encourages major banks to make further repayments of
such borrowing to their foreign branches, then banks could become more
aggressive issuers of CD's despite their weak loan demands.

I- 7
Balance of payments
The Presidential action restricting convertibility of the dollar
into gold or other reserve assets was taken in the light of accumulated
evidence of the existence of a substantial disequilibrium in exchange
rates between the dollar and other major foreign currencies, and of
massive short-term capital flows that were provoked by market realization
of the extent of the disequilibrium.
Large capital flows in the first half of August produced
further exceptionally large U.S. payments deficits; through the first
seven months of the year the official settlements deficit totaled $14
billion (not an annual rate).
Following announcement of the President's program, all major
European central banks halted purchases of dollars, and European exchange
rates generally appreciated beyond previous support levels in very light
trading. The Bank of Japan continued to purchase dollars, and in the
period August 16-18 had gained $1-1/2 billion.
The Administration's action on international monetary arrangements
suspended convertibility of the dollar into gold and other reserve assets,
and requested the Federal Reserve to cease providing exchange cover through
the swap network for foreign official dollar balances.
The White House release stated that "the official U.S. dollar
price of gold is not altered by the present action, and the President
has directed that that price be maintained."

I -8
The economic program also involved, as a temporary measure,
imposition of an import surcharge of 10 per cent on dutiable imports,
which comprise roughly one-half of total U.S. imports; exempt from the
surcharge are nondutiable items such as coffee and raw materials and
all products subject to mandatory quotas, including oil, meats, sugar,
and cotton textiles, as well as Canadian autos.
The program set the stage for a necessary realignment of interna-
tional exchange rates, and for review of other aspects of international
trade and payments.
The extent of the U.S. disequilibrium became clear when the
U.S. trade balance deteriorated to a deficit of $4 billion (seasonally
adjusted annual rate) in the second quarter. As financial markets became
aware of the size of the overall payments deficit in the second quarter,
speculation heightened, and following publication of a report by the
Reuss Subcommittee of the Joint Economic Committee calling for exchange
rate realighment, capital flows from the United States into European
countries accelerated further.
Even large appreciations of foreign currencies could not be
expected to benefit the U.S. trade balance before 1972, and any improvement
from the President's economic program during the remainder of 1971 should be
expected to be on the import side, reflecting the impact of the 10 per
cent surcharge. However, there could be immediate benefits for the
capital account of the U.S. payments balance from sizable appreciations
of foreign currencies--notably the impetus such actions might give to
unwinding speculative positions, and the elimination of the special in-
centives for long-term capital outflows from the United States that exist
so long as markets judge the dollar to be overvalued.

THE ECONOMIC PICTURE IN DETAIL
Domestic Nonfinancial Scene
Gross national product--second quarter revisions. Revisions
for the second quarter show somewhat greater strength in GNP than
originally reported--particularly in the domestic sector. Total GNP
rose by $20.5 billion, $0.8 billion more than reported earlier. But
net exports were revised down by $2.3 billion to a negative $2.2 billion--
$6-1/2 billion below the second quarter level--while outlays for other
sectors were raised by $3.1 billion. Excluding net exports, GNP rose by
almost $27 billion. (Confidential until release August 20.)

Revised second quarter figures showed greater strength in
consumer demand than reported earlier. Durable goods outlays were
raised almost $1 billion and personal consumption expenditures for
the second quarter now total $16.3 billion more than in the first.
With strong gains in disposable income, reflecting in part the retro-
active increase in Social Security benefits, the saving rate remained
high, at 8.2 per cent.
Stocks accumulated in anticipation of a possible steel
strike were somewhat larger than expected, and inventory investment was
revised up $1 billion to $5.7 billion, an increase of $2-1/2 billion
from the first quarter. Business fixed investment outlays were revised
up by almost $1 billion to an increase of over $2-1/2 billion and
residential construction expenditures continued to show strong growth,
rising by $3.3 billion, as housing starts rose further.
The rise in the implicit GNP deflator moderated slightly
more in the second quarter than earlier reported, to a 4.1 per cent rate
rate of increase. In real terms GNP growth was at a 4 per cent annual
rate, the largest quarterly increase, other than the post-GM strike
rebound, since early 1968.
A tentative set of projections reflecting the expected
short term impact of the new economic policies announced earlier this
week will be presented in the Supplement to be distributed August 20.

Industrial production. Industrial production declined 0.8
per cent in July and at 106.0 per cent of the 1967 average was 5.3
per cent below the 1969 high and 3.3 per cent above the low of last
November. Output declines were concentrated in the materials producing
sector although production of equipment was also off somewhat further.
Output of consumer goods changed little.
Steel production was cut back further in July and in early
August reflecting the lack of current demand as steel users began
efforts to reduce excessive inventories. Output of copper was sharply
reduced in July by strikes, and coal production declined because of lack
of freight cars resulting from the railroad strike. These reductions
accounted for almost .8 of the .9 point decline in the total index. A
moderate further drop in output of business and defense equipment
accounted for the rest of the decline.
Output of consumer goods in July was 3.2 per cent above its
1969 peak but has changed little since May. Auto production schedules
for August and September, after allowance for the model changeover
period, are set at the 8.5 million unit rate of July. With stocks of
other consumer durable goods--appliances, radios, and TV sets--at
record levels, consumer demand does not seem to be strong enough to
warrant significantly increased output of these goods in the next few
months, although the President's new economic program may stimulate
consumer buying in this area as well as of autos. While the rate of
decline in production of business equipment has slowed considerably in

II -5
the past 3 months, a marked recovery in output of these goods in the
next month or two appears unlikely in view of the recent course of new
orders.
From May to July, the decline in steel production resulted
in .5 of a point decline in the total production index. In August,
cutbacks in steel will exert a downdrag of 1 to 2 points but a partial
offset -- .3-.4 of a point -- will result from settlement of the copper
and railroad strikes. Altogether, the total production index is likely
to register a sizable decline.

Retail sales. Retail sales in July declined 0.8 per cent
from June, according to the advance report, but remained at the advanced
second quarter rate. Sales of nondurable goods were down 1.0 per cent,
largely because general merchandise stores were down from the very
strong pace of June. Sales of durable goods stores changed little, with
a small rise in the automotive group and a decline of nearly 2 per cent
at furniture and appliance stores.
Sales in the March through July period averaged 7.7 per cent
above a year earlier, the strongest year-to-year comparison since early
1969. The automotive and general merchandise groups were primarily
responsible for the stronger showing.

Consumer credit. The increase in consumer instalment credit
outstanding during June amounted to $6.3 billion, seasonally adjusted
annual rate. This was somewhat greater than the $5.9 billion increase
in May but well below the $8.0 billion advance in April. While the
$6.7 billion rise in outstandings for the second quarter as a whole
was the largest quarterly increase since the fourth quarter of 1969,
it was substantially less than the record $10 billion increases in
the final two quarters of 1968.
Although the proportion of both new and used cars sold on
credit has declined in recent months, total extensions have risen
because of an increase in the absolute number of vehicles financed and
a sizable advance in the average size of instalment contracts.
The average size of new car contracts was up nearly $200
since the last half of 1970, with accompanying higher montly payments;
this has prompted further movement toward a lengthening of terms from
the present standard 36 month financing. While a few commercial banks
in scattered areas have extended maturities on new car contracts to
42 or even 48 months, the most important break-through has been made
by Ford Motor Credit Company. New car buyers in the San Diego metro-
politan area have been offered 42 month financing by FMCC since April 1.
This has enabled the company to compete with local banks granting such

II -8
terms, and has helped dealers in meeting competition of import sales
in the area by holding down monthly payments on domestic units. Since
the program began approximately 10 per cent of Ford sales in the area
have been financed for 42 months.

Consumer buying and income expections. The July Census survey
suggests a deterioration of consumer sentiment, following the slight
turn-up that the Census, Michigan and Conference Board surveys began
to show at the beginning of the year. Thus, the Census index of
expected unit car purchases in the next 6 to 12 months declined to
94.8 in July from 104.7 (Jan.-April 1967 = 100) in April. This is
the lowest value for this seasonally adjusted index since April 1967.
Buying plans for homes and appliances also declined, and expected
expenditures for appliances, furniture and home improvements fell to a
low level.

II -9
Current income compared with a year earlier improved, with
more households reporting higher income and fewer households reporting
lower income. However, expectations of future income change deteriorated
to about the January level and expected income improvement tends to
be much more closely correlated with higher durable goods purchase
plans than is recent actual income experience.

Residential construction and real estate. Seasonally adjusted
outlays for new construction, which were revised upward 1 per cent to a
new high for June, changed little in July. The July level was 17 per cent
above the cyclical low reached in July 1970. Even after allowance for cost
increases, the year-to-year advance amounted to 10 per cent, concentrated
entirely in outlays for residential structures.
Current dollar outlays for residential structures in July
remained at the advanced second quarter rate. However, July outlays may have
been appreciably understated in view of the additional upsurge in housing
starts which has now been reported for July and which was not anticipated
in the Census Bureau's initial outlay estimates.
Expenditures for private nonresidential construction in July
apparently continued near the peak registered last April despite a further
sharp decline in outlays for the industrial structures component, the major

II -11
source of weakness in this area. Within the public sector, outlays
for State and local projects have remained quite steady in recent
months, and in July were only moderately below their record first
quarter rate.

1/ Data for the most recent month (July) are confidential Census Bureau
extrapolations. In no case should public reference be made to them.
Seasonally adjusted private housing starts in July soared
a tenth above the exceptional 2 million unit rate in June. This
reflected mainly a 27 per cent surge in multifamily starts to a
rate above the 1 million level for the first time on record and a
47 per cent share of the total. A factor in this rise, which coincided

II -12
with the beginning of the new fiscal year, may have been a substantial
pick-up in subsidized multifamily starts. These, unlike subsidized
singlefamily starts, had been running appreciably under year-earlier
levels since last December.
With mortgage commitments outstanding apparently continuing
strong and over-all building permits at a historic high, an annual
rate above the 2.05 million unit level initially projected for the
third quarter now seems indicated. Assuming mobile home shipments con-
tinue close to their recent high, the combined "shelter-count" for
the third quarter could move into the 2.6 million unit range. This
would compare with a previous record annual rate of 2.44 million
units in the second quarter and would exceed the recent low in the
first quarter of 1970 by 1 million units.
Seasonally adjusted sales of new homes by merchant builders
in June--latest available--and in the second quarter as a whole were
holding near the record rate reached in the first quarter of the
year despite some apparent slippage in the share represented by
subsidized--lower-cost--units. Associated with this development, the
median price of new units sold in June rose further, to $26,200,
10 per cent above the declining level a year earlier. While builder
stocks of new homes for sale increased in June, they were still com-
paratively low in relation to sales and were available at a median
price only slightly above that of units being sold. In the market for
existing homes, the median price of units sold was $25,100 in June or

1/ Apart from starts, mobile home shipments for domestic use in
June--the latest month for which data are available--were at a
record seasonally adjusted annual rate of 490,000. This helped
to bring the rate for the second quarter as a whole to 480,000
or 13 per cent above the previous quarterly high in IIIQ, 1970.
2/ Based on unadjusted totals for all periods. FHA-insured starts
include both subsidized and nonsubsidized units.
11 per cent above a year earlier, according to the National Association
of Real Estate Boards. This compared with a year-to-year margin of
about 6 per cent during the first three months of this year and all of
1970.

II -14
Manufacturers' orders and shipments. New orders for durable
goods declined 0.6 per cent in June, according to still-preliminary
data, rather than the 1.1 per cent indicated by the advance report.
Excluding steel, new orders were unchanged in June at a level slightly
below the first quarter average in current dollars, and off by about
1-1/2 per cent after allowing for, the continued increase in durable
goods prices. Some of the recent weakness has been in defense orders;
excluding both defense and steel, June orders were slightly higher than
in May and 2 per cent above the first quarter average in current
dollars--about half a per cent above the first quarter in constant
dollars.
Capital equipment orders now show a slight increase in June
but remain no higher in current dollars than last November; in constant
dollars, such orders were off 1-1/2 per cent from the first quarter
average.
The durable goods manufacturers' backlog is still indicated
to have dropped 3 per cent in June. Unfilled orders declined at all
major groups, but the biggest drops were $1.1 billion in defense
products and $0.8 billion in iron and steel. The decline in the
defense backlog included $0.4 billion ascribed to completion of bill-
ings on major aerospace contracts; also included is a $0.5 billion
rise in shipments and an equivalent drop in inventories at the aero-
space industry.

Since November 1970, the date tentatively chosen as the
cycle trough, the durable goods order backlog has declined more than
3 per cent, both including and excluding primary metals. This compares
unfavorably with the seven-month periods following previous cycle
troughs. Some of the decline in backlogs is accounted for by defense
products; but defense backlogs were also declining in the early stages
of the previous cyclical recoveries. After eliminating defense, the com-
parison is still unfavorable in current dollars, and is more so after
allowing for the greater price increase in the current period.QI Q II

Inventories. The book value of business inventories rose
at a $4.2 billion annual rate in June, according to preliminary data;
this was down from the April and May rates. Sales were rising faster
than stocks and the overall business inventory-sales ratio declined
to the lowest point since September 1966. However, the inventory-
unfilled orders ratio at durable goods manufacturers rose further to
a new record high--well above previous steel stockpiling periods.
For the second quarter as a whole, growth in inventories of
metal materials at manufacturing and trade establishments was somewhat
larger than in the first quarter, accounting for most of the small
increase in total second-quarter accumulation. Durable goods manu-
facturers continued to liquidate stocks other than materials, and growth
in retail auto stocks slowed; these negative influences on the second-
quarter rate of accumulation were about offset by a somewhat larger
growth at nondurable and miscellaneous durable goods establishments.
According to the Census Bureau, completion of billion on
contracts in the aerospace industry accounted for a $0.4 billion ($4.8
billion, annual rate) drop in inventories in June; there were corre-
sponding declines in order backlogs and increases in shipments. This
usually happens whenever an item with a long production time is paid
for, but since the amount appears particularly large and since the
transactions may have occurred somewhat earlier than normal, data ex-
cluding these changes are also shown in the tables. Excluding the bill-
ing completion, inventory growth is raised for the month and the quarter,
the inventory-shipments ratios show less improvement, and the inventory-
backlog ratios show almost the same increase.

A part of the recent improvement in the inventory-sales
ratio reflected high pre-labor-contract levels of steel sales; but metals
sales fell off somewhat in June and should drop further by August.
Relative to use, steel stocks appear higher than in previous pre-contract
periods.
The inventory-sales ratio has improved for the rest of
durable goods manufacturing, but while these manufacturers have been
drawing down their inventories and increasing their shipments of goods
other than materials, they have also been running down their order
backlog, so that even excluding steel stockpiling, the inventory-
backlog ratio was high and rising as of the end of June. The dwindling
backlog may eventually result in a decline in sales. Until order back-
logs stop falling faster than inventories, prospects for inventory
growth in this area are poor.June

Retail auto dealers' stocks rose relative to sales in May
and June, but in July, according to unit data, new car stocks and the
stock-sales ratio were reduced. Elsewhere, the ratio of stocks to
sales for nondurable goods and miscellaneous durable goods continued to
improve through June, but retail sales for this group declined in July,
according to the advance report.

Labor market. The unemployment rate moved up 0.2 percentage
points to 5.8 per cent, seasonally adjusted, in July, after dropping
sharply in June. Most of the rise occurred among women and teenagers.
Nonfarm payroll employment declined by 190,000 in July for the second
consecutive month, with manufacturing employment down 130,000.
The civilian labor force rose sharply in July (700,000,
seasonally adjusted), but not by enough to offset the drop of 1 million
in June. At 83.8 million, the civilian labor force was virtually un-
changed from the January level and only 1.2 million above July 1970;
the total labor force was only 850,000 above a year earlier--little more
than half the increase normally expected on the basis of population
growth and trends in labor force participation rates.
Unemployment rate increases in July were widespread among
major groups, except adult males; sharpest rate increases were posted
for teenage and adult females and young adult males. At 5.3 per cent,
the unemployment rate for white workers showed little change in July.
However, the rate for Negro workers--which has been more volatile than
usual in recent months--moved up 0.7 percentage points to 10.1 per cent.
The July decline in manufacturing employment was widespread
with over four-fifths of the job loss among production workers. The
largest decline was in primary metals, reflecting cutbacks in steel
production and a strike in the copper industry. Factory employment
in July was down 300,000 from the post-auto strike high in December
and 900,000 from a year earlier.

Average weekly hours of factory production workers edged

However, factory hours remained somewhat above the winter lows.
Payroll employment in most nonmanufacturing industries has
shown no appreciable growth for the last few months. Compared with
last July sizable employment gains have been posted only in trade,
services and State and local governments and even these increases are
smaller than those in other recent years.

*Based on data that have not been seasonally adjusted.
Productivity and labor costs. Output per manhour in the
private economy increased at an annual rate of 1.7 per cent in the
second quarter. This was substantially below the sharp first quarter
rise which was inflated by the recovery from the G.M. strike. Output
growth in the second quarter was much slower than in the first, while
manhours rose somewhat more rapidly; in fact, the 2.1 per cent increase
was the largest since early 1969.
The rise in compensation per manhour slowed to a 6.7 per cent
annual rate in the second quarter following an exceptionally rapid
first quarter gain; the increase from a year earlier was 8.0 per cent,
the largest since early 1969. On the other hand, year-over-year gains

II -22
in productivity have also been substantially larger than in 1969 and
1970. Thus, the over-the-year rise in unit labor costs has been
reduced appreciably, from 7.0 per cent in 1969 to 4.2 per cent in
the second quarter of this year.

Major contract settlements. Wage rate increases averaged
8.0 per cent a year in major private nonfarm settlements concluded
during the first half of this year compared with nearly 9 per cent in
1970 as a whole. Major agreements in this period covered close to
1,35 million workers including those in the petroleum, can, aluminum,

II -23
apparel, automobile, farm machinery and railroad industries. Few con-
struction workers, however, were included and first year increases in
these settlements tended to be smaller than in 1970.

In manufacturing, wage rate increases were higher than in
1970, averaging 6.4 per cent annually over the life of the contract and
8.7 per cent in the first year. In contrast, the averages for non-
manufacturing were smaller than in 1970, reflecting in part the lower
settlements in the construction industry. Large settlements covering
almost 700,000 construction workers contributed heavily to the higher
averages in 1970. In the first half of this year, only 9 construction10.0

settlements covering 35,000 workers were included; for the 3 major
settlements subject to approval by the Construction Industry Stabili-
zation Committee, the average wage increase is estimated at 12.3 per
cent over the life of the contract.
When wages and benefits are combined, the average increase
over the life of the contract was 8.3 per cent a year in major settle-
ments concluded in the first half of 1971 compared with 9.1 per cent
in 1970 as a whole.

II -25
Industrial relations. Agreement was reached by the steel-
workers union and nine major steel companies on August 1 on a new
three-year contract covering 350,000 workers. The steel settlement
followed closely the pattern of wage and fringe benefit increases
established earlier this year in the can contracts and followed later
in the aluminum and copper agreements. Wages were increased about
$1.18 an hour, totaling close to 30 per cent over the life of the
contract. The wage package included the pattern first-year catch-up
wage increase of 50 cents an hour followed by 12-1/2 cent increases
in both the second and third contract years, and an unlimited quarterly
cost-of-living escalator effective the beginning of the second year
with a guaranteed minimum 12-1/2 cent adjustment in each year. Further
wage increases result from an increase in the increment between job
classes and from a 50-cent increase in the base for calculating incen-
tive pay. Improved fringe benefits included vacation bonuses, an
increase in premium pay for Sunday work, higher pension and welfare
benefits and larger weekly supplementary unemployment payments.
The railroads and 190,000 members of the United Transporta-
tion Union reached agreement August 2 after prolonged negotiations on
work rule changes; the agreement ended strikes begun during July and
finally involving a total of 10 carriers. The settlement provided wage
increases totaling 42 per cent over 42 months, the pattern established
in agreements reached by other rail unions earlier this year. The
controversial work rule requiring a crew change every 100 miles is to

II -26
be submitted to union-management committees. If no agreement is
reached in 90 days, the issue will be subject to binding arbitration.
Workers whose jobs are abolished by work rule changes are guaranteed
one year of severance pay for each year of service. Still to be
completed are settlements with the six shopcraft rail unions where
negotiations are already underway. Most of the 39,000 copper workers
on strike since July 1 had returned to work by early August following
settlements at most major companies. But no progress has been report-
ed in negotiations involving 19,000 longshoremen and West Coast shippers,
and the strike begun July 1 continues to tie up West Coast ports.
Wholesale prices. Wholesale prices rose at a seasonally-
adjusted annual rate of 2.4 per cent from June to July. The largest
increase posted for industrial commodities since August 1956 was largely
offset by a sharp decline in prices of farm and food products. Con-
secutive large monthly increases brought the rise in industrials to an
annual rate of 6.1 per cent over the three months ending in July and
almost 5 per cent at an annual rate from six months ago; these are the
largest sutained increases since 1956.
Higher prices for intermediate materials were mainly respons-
ible for the increase in industrial commodities, reflecting increased
demand for lumber and wood products and other building materials and
increased prices of steel mill products. The West Coast dock strike
is an increasingly important factor in restricting supplies of lumber,
prices of which are reported to have risen substantially further in the
last three weeks.

1/ Farm products, and processed foods and feeds.
2/ Excludes food.
Prices of (nonfood) finished goods, following several months
of relatively small increases, spurted in July owing mainly to an
increase in prices of consumer goods. Prices of apparel and tires and
tubes rose strongly, and those for passenger cars moved higher as dis-
counts to dealers were reduced. Machinery and truck prices also increased
substantially.
The decline in farm and food products mainly reflected a
sharp drop in prices of fresh fruits and vegetables as overlapping of
harvests caused by weather conditions was responsible for larger than
seasonal increases in vegetables supplies; the dock strike brought

II -28
about a surplus of citrus fruits on the West Coast. Corn prices
recently have dropped further reflecting improved expectations of a
large crop.
After the pricing date for the July WPI, a number of important
price increases were announced for metals and passenger cars and trucks.
These are described below, even though the 90-day price freeze announced
by President Nixon will prevent most of them from going into effect as
scheduled.
Tentative increases of about 4 to 5 per cent for passenger
cars and more than 5 per cent for trucks were announced by major auto-
mobile producers. Following the announced price freeze, major producers
rescinded these price increases.
The price of prime western zinc in late July was increased
1 cent a pound to 17 cents a pound--the third increase this year. One
of the major aluminum producers, despite widespread discounting recently,
announced a two-step increase--1/2 cent a pound on September 1 and another
1 cent on January 1--in an effort to raise realized prices for aluminum
ingot.
During the first week in August, major steel producers
announced a three-step price increase averaging 8 per cent on most
steel mill products. If extra charges are considered, the wholesale
price index for steel mill products would show about a 7 per cent increase
following final-stage increases. First-step increases were made on
August 5 for semifinished steel, bars, rod, wire, structural steels,
railroad, and tubular products. If allowed to stand, these increases

II -29
would raise the August WPI by 0.1 per cent and industrial commodities
by 0.2 per cent. By December, increases by most producers covering
most products were to have been inaugurated. Governmental policy
following the present 90-day price freeze is still unknown. As
originally announced, however, the rise in prices of steel mill
products from July to December would result in an increase in the
overall WPI of about 0.2 per cent and a rise in the index of indus-
trial commodities of about 0.3 per cent.
1971 crop prospects. A bumper crop, 11 per cent above last
year and 7 per cent above the old 1969 record, is indicated by the
August 1 survey of crop conditions. Crop acreage is 3 per cent larger
than last year and indicated output per acre is 8 per cent larger.
Grains account for the bulk of the prospective gain with feed grain
output (mainly corn) forecast at 200 million tons, up 26 per cent from
last year's short output, and food grains estimated at 54 million tons,
up 15 per cent.
The 5,345 million bushel crop forecast for corn is 30 per cent
above last year and 12 per cent above the previous high reached in 1967.
Blight beclouds prospects but the large acreage and excellent develop-
ment of the crop to date indicate that output will be very large in
spite of the blight. Gains are in prospect for grain sorghums, barley,
wheat, and soybeans.
Feed grain and wheat supplies will probably exceed use in
1971-72 with resulting net additions to stocks, as shown in the table,
and prices are likely to stay close to loan rates. Soybean supplies,

II -30
however, will probably be barely large enough to meet demands and
prices may average about a fourth above the loan rate.

The impact of the big grain crops is likely to show up in the
Federal Budget before it is felt by consumers in the form of increased
supplies and lower priced livestock food products. Expanded demand for
price support loans beginning this fall may boost Commodity Credit
Corporation spending by $0.8 to $1.0 billion above the 1972 Budget
estimate. Substantially expanded meat supplies will probably reach con-
sumers sometime around mid-1972.
Producers will probably respond to cheaper livestock feed
by increasing output. Broiler numbers can be expanded fastest. Broiler
output, now below a year ago, is expected to move higher by late fall
and possibly average 6 to 8 per cent above a year earlier by next spring.
Supplies of feeder cattle are larger than last year and beef output can

II -31
be expanded by increasing numbers on feed and by feeding to heavier weights.
Pork production will probably be the slowest to expand because a cyclical
decline in hogs is in progress and a turn-around could not be effected in
less than a year. Low profits on hogs since last fall may dampen producers'
enthusiasm for an immediate expansion in production.

THE ECONOMIC PICTURE IN DETAIL
Domestic Financial Situation
Monetary aggregates. M1 increased at an annual rate of
10-1/2 per cent in July, about in line with the pace in the second
quarter. Preliminary and partial data suggest that during the early
part of August the rate of expansion in M1 moderated somewhat. Because
of a marked slackening of flows into bank thrift accounts, M2 rose
more slowly in July than in any other month since March 1970. The
July growth rate for M3 was better sustained, as claims on nonbank
thrift institutions continued to increase strongly.

The markedly slower growth of consumer-type time and savings
deposits at commercial banks during July apparently continued in the
early part of August, as depositors responded further to the rise in
market interest rates that had taken place since mid-March. In addition,
information obtained by Reserve Bank staffs from commercial banks in
their Districts suggests that, with business loan demands modest and
asset portfolios liquid, many banks have not been aggressively
seeking such deposits.
It is not clear why deposit flows at nonbank thrift institu-
tions have not been as severely affected by the uptrend in market rates
as flows at commercial banks. In part, this divergence may be
attributable to the higher deposit rates these institutions are allowed
to pay. In addition, depositors at banks may be more sensitive to
alternative investment opportunities than are depositors at thrift
institutions. Such a divergence in investment behavior appears to
exist between depositors at large and small commercial banks, as
deposits held at large banks, particularly large deposits, tend to
respond more quickly and in greater volume to fluctuations in market
rates.
Bank sales of large CD's increased sharply in July, but then
appeared to slow in the early part of August. The July expansion
occurred partly because some of the funds obtained by AT&T in its
recent financing were invested temporarily in CD's. In addition,
State and local governments and foreign official institutions continued

III -3
to acquire certificates in large volume. With CD funds readily avail-
able in July, banks made only moderate upward adjustments in their
offering rates, and sales continued to be concentrated in very short-
term maturities. Following the President's announcement, CD offering
rates declined in unison with the reduction in open market rates.
The rate of growth in the adjusted credit proxy was slightly
more rapid in July than in June, as the sharp increase in CD's and
the strong rise in private demand deposits more than offset the marked
reduction in growth of other time and savings deposits, a slight drop
in U.S. Treasury deposits and a further decline in nondeposit funds.
The drop in nondeposit funds mainly reflected a fairly sharp decline
in Euro-dollar borrowings. Euro-dollar liabilities also decreased
slightly further during the early part of August, and then dropped
sharply when Euro-dollar interest rates increased sharply in reaction
to the President's new economic program.
Bank credit. Commercial bank credit (end of month series)
increased during July at a pace somewhat slower than in June but about
in line with the rate of advance during the second quarter. The slow-
down was attributable to a sharp drop in holdings of U.S. Treasury
securities. In part, this appears to reflect the liquidation of secu-
rities acquired in the Treasury's late June financing operation. In
addition, the volume of new securities issued by the Treasury over the
month was well below the customary volume for July. Bank acquisitions

III -4
of other securities on the other hand rebounded from the weak June
increase to about the pace set earlier in the second quarter. The
July increase in other securities was concentrated in municipal issues

Total loans increased very sharply in July, expanding at a
rate well above that recorded in June and during the second quarter as
a whole. The increase reflected large increases in only two major loan
categories, real estate loans and business loans; and, as discussed below,1970

the business loan increase appears attributable to a temporary spurt
in this series. The strong expansion in real estate loans extends
a sharp uptrend that started late last year. As they did earlier in
the year, banks in the San Francisco District accounted for a major
share of the July increase in real estate loans, which is consistent
with the exceptionally strong construction activity in that area.
Our statistics indicate a rise in business loans at a seasonally
adjusted annual rate in excess of 10 per cent in July. This increase,
which essentially offsets the sharp drop in these loans in June, does
not appear to signal a resurgence in business loan demands but rather
to reflect a combination of irregular and seasonal factors. Recent
discussions that Reserve Bank staffs have had with commercial banks
across the country generally lend support to this interpretation of the
July developments. Moreover, there are no obvious factors suggesting
that loan demands are strengthening. Indeed, business demands for short-
term credit are being moderated by the improved flow of internally
generated funds and by continued modest accumulations of inventories.
The absence of significant business credit demands would appear to
explain the reluctance of money market banks to go along immediately
with the further hike in the prime rate instituted by a medium-sized
Detroit Bank, and with market rates down sharply in reaction to the
President's economic plan, a general prime rate advance now seems
unlikely.

Nonbank depositary intermediaries. Deposit inflows during
July apparently were much better maintained at the nonbank thrift
institutions than at commercial banks. On a seasonally unadjusted
basis, both major types of nonbank intermediaries received record
inflows. After seasonal adjustment, however, they showed a divergent
pattern from recent months, with only the savings and loan associa-
tions actually increasing their pace of inflows.

The further moderation in the rate of deposit inflows
during July to mutual savings banks may reflect a somewhat isolated
experience of the New York City institutions, which were subject to
special competition from a New York City bond issue that offered a
particularly attractive yield and carried exemption from income taxes
at all three levels of government for City residents. Savings banks
elsewhere, such as in Massachusetts, apparently had inflows that were
more consistent with the larger earlier growth patterns. At the New
York City savings banks, there appears to have been no further pressure
on deposit inflows during the first week of August; although the large
margin of inflows this year over previous years had begun to narrow
during July, it nevertheless continued at a rate suggesting that inflows
have not fallen further.

During May and June, savings and loan associations continued
to have cash flows agumented not only by their large net savings inflows
but also by a substantial volume of mortgage repayments arising largely
from the increases in refinancings, as shown in the following table. The
large net repayment of borrowed funds shown in the table reflects pri-
marily activity during May related to the FHLBB's then-ending one-year
subsidized rate advances program. Since then, there have been only
minimal changes in FHLB advances and in S&L liquid asset acquisitions.

Mortgage market. Although savings inflows to nonbank thrift
institutions remained large during July, average returns to lenders
on new home-mortgage loans rose somewhat further in the primary as
well as the secondary market. In both cases,yields approached the
8 per cent usury ceilings still prevailing in 11 States and the
District of Columbia, chiefly for conventional mortgages.1/ Relative
to new issues of high-grade corporate bonds, rates on mortgages improved
slightly in July but nevertheless continued quite unfavorable. No data
are yet available for August, either before or after the Presidential
message.

On Government-underwritten mortgages bearing the 7 per cent
ceiling rate, average discounts reached as high as 7.8 points in July,
reinforcing trade expectations that an upward ceiling adjustment would
be forthcoming. Instead, the President authorized GNMA to subsidize
a portion of the discount points charged on certain mortgages under-
written after August 6 by FHA and VA under their regular non-subsidized
programs.2/ Pending issuance of GNMA's regulation and testing of the ne
program, FNMA suspended its periodic auction of forward purchase
commitments until August 25.
In the conventional home mortgage sector, the FHLBBoard's
subsidized Housing Opportunity Allowance Program (HOAP) has remained
quite modest in scope.3/ In a period of strong savings inflows, S&Ls have
generally been reluctant to borrow from the FHLBanks in order to finance
these special higher-risk loans. Although activity has nearly doubled
since regulations were liberalized in June, by early August--5 months
after the program had been initiated--fewer than 2,000 loans had been
closed or committed out of some 50,000 potentially available.
2/ The announcement made on August 7 indicated that GNMA will follow
the same general procedure already in use under its Tandem Plans, which
hitherto have applied solely to FHA's special Sec. 235 and Sec. 236 pro-
grams for low-income borrowers. Under the new subsidy plan, GNMA will
;urchase existing-home loans at a price of 95 per cent of par, and new-
home loans and apartment-house loans at 96. It will resell the mortgages
to FNMA, FHLMC, or other private investors at the prevailing market price.
GNMA will absorb any resulting capital loss as part of its special assist-
ance function. To be eligible, loans cannot exceed $22,000 on dwellings
with 3 or fewer bedrooms, or $24,500 on units with 4 or more bedrooms.
There is no upper limit on borrower incomes.
3/ FHLBanks under the HOAP program provide subsidized advances to member
institutions that lend to eligible low- and middle-income homebuyers,
often on unusually low downpayment loans. Current regulations authorize
an interest rate writedown on each mortgage of $20 per month for the first
5 years the loan remains outstanding; the nominal interest rate on the
loan cannot be more than 150 basis points above the cost of the FHLBank ad-
vance. On an 8 per cent 25-year $20,000 mortgage, a reduction in interest
of $20 monthly for 5 years, totaling $1,200 is roughly equivalent to
reducing the borrower's interest cost to 6-3/4 per cent during this period.

III -11
Corporate and municipal securities markets. Yields on new
Aaa-rated corporate bond issues remained near 8.00 per cent from mid-
July to mid-August. Even though the volume of new corporate bonds,
both recent and prospective, remained appreciably less than earlier
in the year, on the whole institutional investors bought selectively.
The upturn in money market rates, rumors of further rises in the prime
and discount rates, evidence of continued inflation, and disturbances
in international currency markets apparently revived expectations of
further increases in yields. Municipal bond rates fluctuated in a
narrow range, and at mid-August were unchanged from the mid-July level.
After the Presidential message on August 15, a substantial
rally developed, bringing long-term corporate bond yields down
70 basis points by Tuesday, August 17. The quick sellout of Aaa
telephone issue on Tuesday at 7.40 per cent is indicative of the
surge of optimism in the long-term markets. Yields on tax-exempt
bonds fell about 35 to 40 basis points in the two days following the
President's announcement.

In reaction to the President's statement on August 15, the
stock price indices increased 3 to 5 per cent by August 17, with a
record two-day average daily NYSE trading volume of 29 million shares.
This rise erased virtually all of the downward drift in stock prices
that had occurred since mid-July. Trading volume over this same period
had been relatively low averaging, for example, about 12 million shares
daily on the NYSE.

Publicly-offered corporate bonds in July are estimated to
have totaled $1.2 billion, the lowest level in the last 16 months. A
number of firms deferred issues in the latter half of July when corporate
rates began to rise, which accounts for most of the shortfall from
earlier estimates. It is too early yet to assess the impact of recent
events on the corporate calendar. Prior to the announcement of the new
economic policies, the staff had estimated that August and September
volume would remain close to $1.5 billion per month, with the third
quarter volume thus expected to aggregate ultimately about one-third
less than the preceding quarter. In part, the lower level of bond

III -13
issues reflects the usual summer lull in new issue activity. Much
more important, however, is the considerable slowdown in offerings
by industrial firms in July and those expected over the near term.
Underwriters continue to report a sizable decline in the prospec-
tive number of such offerings.
Despite the drop off in public bond issues, total corporate
security offerings are expected to remain quite large. New equity
offerings remain at a high level, and it appears that the monthly
average of stock issues during the third quarter will be about $850
million, exclusive of the large AT&T issue. Revised data indicate
that takedowns of private placements in the second quarter were even
larger than originally estimated, and this higher rate of activity
is expected to continue in the third quarter. Total corporate
security offerings in August and September, therefore, are still
expected to be around $3 billion,

Long-term debt offerings by State and local governments
appear to be tapering slightly over the third quarter. July volume
was $1.9 billion, and it is now estimated that August will reach $1.8
billion, since two large issues which had been postponed several times
finally were marketed successfully. Banks continue to support the
market in the short- to intermedaite-term maturity range, and acquisi-
tions by casualty insurance companies in the long-term area have
picked up again. These insurance companies have had a favorable
loss experience this year and find tax-exempt income still quite
attractive. Before the events of recent days the staff had estimated
September volume at $1.8 billion. Anticipated bond sales for the
third quarter of 1971 will be analyzed in a Greenbook Supplement,
based on the FRB-Census Survey of State and Local Long-Term Bond
Anticipations and Realizations.
In June and July State and local governments apparently
paid down short-term debt on a net basis for the first time in over
a year. Gross short-term sales fell off sharply in July, but the
August figure will be boosted by a large offering in New York City
notes.

Corporate profits in manufacturing. Available information
on manufacturing profits in the second quarter suggests that the pre-
liminary estimate of aggregate corporate profits in that quarter,
which will become available at the end of this week, will show only
a modest rise from the first quarter level. Profits in the important
manufacturing sector appear to have increased very little from the
first quarter, after rough allowance for seasonal fluctuation, and
profits per dollar of sales apparently remained at the first quarter
level.
To a considerable extent, this sluggish first-to-second
quarter performance in manufacturing reflects developments in the
motor vehicle industry. Profits in this industry, which normally

III -16
rise substantially in the second quarter, remained this year at their
first quatter level--which in turn had been swollen by resumption of
operations at General Motors. On a year-over-year basis, total
manufacturing profits were about 5 per cent larger than in the
second quarter of 1970 (3-1/2 per cent excluding autos). This rise,
though modest, represents the first year-to-year increase since the
third quarter of 1969.
Government securities market. The Government securities
market responded strongly to the President's announcement of his
program of domestic and international measures. In the note and bond
market, price gains of 2-1/2 to 3 full points reduced yields by 20
to 60 basis points from their August 13 levels; and in the bill market
rates dropped by around 30 to 60 basis points for most issues. The
key 3-month issue, for example, declined to 4.77 per cent on Tuesday,
August 17, from 5.15 per cent on the Friday prior to the President's
weekend announcement, and 5.46 per cent at the time of the July
Committee meeting.

For most of the period since the last Committee meeting,
yields on Treauury coupon-bearing issues drifted higher as continued
sluggishness in the economy and evidence of some tightening of monetary
policy offset whatever optimism aas generated by the relatively
successful outcome of the Treasury's August financing operation. Even
before the President's statement, however, investor interest in coupon
issues seemed to pick up; and with buying by foreign official accounts
and System purchases of $109 million, the market improved somewhat
and yields tended to move slightly lower.Bills

In the Treasury refunding operation $2.7 billion of the
$4.1 billion of publicly-held maturing issues were exchanged--an
attrition of 35 per cent--with $251 million of that amount representing
exchanges into the 7 per cent, 10-year bond. In addition, $192
million of the 10-year bonds were subscribed to by individuals in small
amounts for cash. On August 4, the Treasury auctioned $2.5 billion
of 18-month notes at a 6.54 per cent average yield on the 6-1/2 per
cent coupon. These notes covered the attrition in the regular refund-
ing and raised about $1.1 billion of new cash.
In the bill market, rates drifted gradually lower following
the last Committee meeting, with rate declines becoming increasingly
marked even before the President's message as continued large foreign
official orders depleted dealers' holdings. Because of these demands
and the fact that dealers were often able to sell out their weekly
auction awards before having to pay for them, the generally higher
level of day-to-day financing costs accompanying the higher level of
the Federal funds rate had little dampening effect on the market.

New issue activity in the Federal agency market has been very
light with the only new issues being a $500 million, 2-year 4-month
issue by FNMA, offered to replace a $513 million maturing issue and
priced to yield 7.15 per cent, and two $250 million issuesby FHLB,
one a 2-1/2 year maturity yielding 7.10 per cent and the other a 4-1/2
year maturity priced to yield 7-3/8 per cent; these issues were to
replace a $650 million maturing issue. In the market for outstanding
agency securities, yield changes have paralleled those in the market
for direct Treasury obligations.

III -20
Other short-term credit markets. Preliminary estimates
indicate that seasonally adjusted commercial and finance company paper
outstanding declined in July by around $270 million to a level of $29.7
billion. The decrease was entirely accounted for by a seasonally
adjusted decline of about $300 million in finance company paper. On
an unadjusted basis, finance company paper outstanding rose almost
$800 million, largely reflecting an increase in automobile companies'
paper outstanding related to an incentive "sale" sponsored by General
Motors. However, the total increase was still less than the normal
seasonal, resulting in a decline on an adjusted basis.
Interest rates in private credit markets remained relatively
stable for the most part through July and into August prior to the
President's speech, with gains outside of longer maturities generally
amounting to about 12 basis points. There were only minor adjustments
in these rates immediately following the President's statement, with
scattered declines of 1/8 to 1/4 in bank CD offering rates and of
about 1/8 on 3-month commercial paper. It is generally expected,
however, that these declines will become more widespread in the near
future as market participants continue to assess the impact of the
President's program.

5/ Reductions previously scheduled for January 1973 advanced to

6/ Assumes postponement to January 1972 of military and postal pay
increases previously scheduled for the fourth quarter.
The package of requests for tax cuts--all of which require
Congressional approval--are estimated to reduce fiscal year revenue by
$6.5 billion. However, some $1 to $2 billion of this may be offset by
receipts anticipated from the imposition of the 10 per cent import

III -24
surcharge, on which no Congressional approval is required. The
actual size of the offset will depend upon the duration of the sur-
charge and the extent to which it curtails the quantity of imports.
Similarly, some of the estimated effects of the tax actions may be
considered tentative especially the investment tax credit, since the
likely timing of business response to this latter action are rather
conjectural.
On the expenditure side, the Presidential proposal to post-
pone general revenue sharing and welfare reform will not greatly affect staff
projections for fiscal 1972. Since Congress is still far from completing
action on the general revenue sharing and welfare reform recommendations
made by the Administration last February, staff projections had already
assumed that these measures would not be enacted in time to affect outlays
in fiscal 1972 (except for a $.5 billion start-up cost for welfare
reform).
The President's other proposals for expenditure reductions do
affect staff projections, although the announced wage-price freeze raises
some unresolved questions. It is not clear, for example, whether the
wage freeze applies to the $2 billion military pay raise which the staff
had previously assumed would be effective in October 1971; the present
staff projection assumes that this item is postponed until January 1972.
Similarly, if the wage freeze is extended beyond the 90-day period it

III -25
could further effect other budget items such as scheduled postal pay
increases and increases in social security benefits, now assumed by
the staff to be effective on January 1972. Finally, the expenditure
effect of the 5 per cent reduction in the Federal work force is difficult
to quantify without some clear basis for measuring the likely timing
of attrition.
Staff estimates suggest that the President's recommended actions
might add as much as $2.0 billion to our previous Greenbook estimate of
the deficit for fiscal 1972. In addition, other changes in the staff's
estimates prior to the President's announcement already suggested a
deepening of the deficit relative to earlier estimates. A thorough
staff review of effective income tax rates--made possible by the
Commerce Department's recent revision of the national income and product
accounts--had resulted in a $3.0 billion downward revision of expected
fiscal year tax receipts, while on the expenditure side, new crop
forecasts have resulted in an $800 million upward revision of estimated
outlays for agricultural price supports. Finally, the GNMA plan to pay
excess discounts on FHA and VA mortgages is estimated to swell outlays
by another $400 million.
As estimates of the impact of the President's program on
total activity and income are not yet available, no comprehensive new
forecast of fiscal year budget totals has been made. However, taking
account of the expected initial effects of the President's program, the

III -26
revised effective tax rates, and the added outlays for farm price
supports and housing finance raises the anticipated fiscal year deficit
to about $30 billion, a more than $6 billion increase over the previous
Greenbook.
Heavy recent cash inflows provided by foreign central bank
purchases of special Government securities have provided unexpected
support to the Treasury cash balance since the last Committee meeting.
Largely as a result of these inflows, the balance is now expected to
be around $7 billion at the end of August, nearly $3.0 billion above
the level projected in the last Greenbook. Assuming no large abrupt
reversal of foreign cash flows, the high end-of-August balance would
seem to obviate the previously anticipated need for new money in early
September. Even the need for financing in October might be reduced
somewhat relative to earlier estimates--although assumptions on the
net position of foreign special issues are more difficult to make the
further one looks into the future.

THE ECONOMIC PICTURE IN DETAIL
International Developments
Foreign exchange markets. All major European exchange
markets have been officially closed since the President announced
the suspension of gold convertibility of the dollar on August 15.
Commercial banks are allowed to deal in these markets, except for
London, but the central banks have not operated in the markets.
Because of the great uncertainty over what will happen when the
markets officially re-open, trading volume has been extremely light,
with very wide bid-offer spreads and individual transactions occurring
only in small amounts.
Major European currencies have all firmed against the dollar.
As of mid-morning in New York on August 18, spot exchange rates,
expressed as a per cent over par, were as follows:
Sterling 2.6
DM 8.3
Swiss franc 2.6
Guilder 5.4
French franc 1.8
Belgian franc 4.0
Lira 3.3
The Japanese exchange market has remained open, and the Bank
of Japan purchased $1.6 billion in the three days August 16-18. However,
the BOJ's intake fell sharply on August 18, reportedly reflecting the
fact that Japanese banks had by that date generally worked off their

IV -2
long-positions in dollars, and are constrained by exchange controls
from making further large-scale conversions of dollars.
European markets are expected to be closed the rest of this
week, pending decisions by the various central banks, either jointly
or severally, on whether to revalue, float, or return to existing
parities, with or without increased exchange controls. In particular,
the EEC countries (perhaps in conjunction with Britain) are faced with
a decision on internal exchange rate relationships as well as their joint-
relationship with the dollar.
Major European gold markets were closed all day Monday and
Tuesday morning, but re-opened Tuesday afternoon. After opening at
around $43.50-$44.00, prices eased to closing levels of about $43.00
down almost $1 from the highs of the previous week.
In the first two weeks of August, during the height of the
speculative attack on the dollar, major foreign central banks purchased
some $4.5 billion, $2 billion of which was accounted for on two days,
August 12 and 13, alone. Switzerland was the major reserve gainer
(see table), despite the fact that the Swiss franc had been revalued
by 7 per cent only three months previously. The reserve gains were very
widespread, however, indicating a general unwillingness of the market
to hold dollars rather than speculation on revaluation of any particular
currency.

The dollar had come under increased selling pressure in
late July, with news of the weakening U.S. trade balance, signs of
accelerated inflation in the U.S., press reports of the Administration's
attack on the independence of the Federal Reserve, publication of
Morgan Guaranty's estimates of the second quarter U.S. payments
deficit, and rumors of the closing of the gold window. Tightening
of French exchange controls in early August, resulting in a sort of
two-tier franc exchange rate, plus the later emergence of a dual rate
in Switzerland, further intensified the growing reluctance of market
participants to hold dollar balances. Late in the afternoon of
Friday, August 6, the U.S. announced its Fund drawing of $862 million

IV -4
equivalent in Belgian francs and Dutch guilders plus the sale of $191
million in gold to France. That same afternoon the Reuss subcommittee
report was issued, recommending the closing of the gold window and
the devaluation of the dollar. Massive dollar sales ensued when
European exchange markets opened the following Monday. Rumors of
the imminent withdrawal of the Swiss National Bank from the exchange
market and a closing of the gold window by the US. were widely
circulated late in the week, and, as mentioned above, major foreign
central banks had to absorb some $2 billion dollars on Thursday and
Friday of that week. The following Sunday the gold window was closed
and European exchange markets failed to open on Monday.
In announcing his historic decision to suspend the convert-
ibility of dollars into gold, the President also instructed the System
to make no further drawings on the reciprocal swap facilities with
foreign central banks. System swap commitments now amount to a record
$3,045 million, following drawings of $1-1/4 billion in Swiss francs,
$3/4 billion in sterling and $220 million in Belgian francs during the
period immediately prior to the President's decision.
Euro-dollar market. Conditions in the Euro-dollar market have
been dominated by foreign exchange market developments since near the
end of July. The continuous decline in Euro-dollar rates from their
early June levels was reversed early in the last week of July as a
result of increasing exchange market uncertainties, a large amount of

IV -5
dollar deliveries to the Bundesbank on maturing forward contracts,
and month-end positioning of European commercial banks.
The first two weeks in August were marked by increasing
nervousness in exchange markets and Euro-dollar rates rose as
market participants attempted to liquidate dollar claims and acquire
dollar liabilities for conversion into other currencies.
Following the President's announcement on August 15, the
Euro-dollar market remained open but rates, particularly on shorter
maturities, were extremely high and volatile. At one point on Monday
overnight deposits were bid at 40 per cent, before moderating to 22
per cent by the end of the day. Rates moderated on Tuesday and
Wednesday but remained quite high relative to rates in recent weeks.
The very high levels of Euro-dollar rates early this week were in
part the result borrowings from the market to deliver on foreign
exchange contracts made prior to the weekend. According to market
sources, another important source of demand for dollar borrowings
was from Japanese commercial banks. These banks reportedly had net
uncovered positions in dollars as of Monday and borrowed Euro-dollars
(converting the dollars obtained from these borrowings into yen with
the bank of Japan) in order to balance their positions.

p/ Preliminary.
In the computation period ended August 4 net liabilities of
U.S. banks to their foreign branches are estimated to have averaged
about $300 million less than in the previous four-week period. This
decline may have largely reflected advances in the overnight Euro-
dollar rate relative to the Federal funds rate in this period, which
eliminated the cost differential favorable to borrowing overnight
Euro-dollars prevailing in the previous computation period.

IV -7
From August 4 to Wednesday, August 11, gross liabilities to
branches declined by $0.8 billion to a level of only $1.1 billion,
reflecting the increasing disadvantage of Euro-dollars relative to
domestic sources of funds to U.S. banks. The Treasury has indicated
that it will not refund the $500 million Euro-dollar C/I issue that
matures on August 24. The primary reason for the decision was the
high cost of Euro-dollars, which was about 10 per cent for 3-month
deposits. Unless U.S. banks increase their liabilities to foreign
branches the loss of this Euro-dollar issue will reduce their reserve
free bases.
U.S. balance of payments. The rate of deterioration of the
balance of payments sharply accelerated in July and early August,
reaching an intolerable situation in the second week of August. After
registering deficits on the official settlements basis (seasonally
adjusted) of $5.7 billion in the first quarter and $5.9 billion in
the second quarter, the July deficit on this basis (not adjusted)
probably reached $2.5 billion and the August deficit -- through the
13th -- was about $4.2 billion.
The large deficits in July and August reflected mainly an
accelerated outflow of speculative funds from the United States in
anticipation of exchange rate changes, but quite likely there was
also a continued weakening in our underlying payments position, although
trade data are not available beyond June. As discussed below, the trade

IV -8
balance in the second quarter was a deficit of over $4 billion at an
annual rate; in the first quarter there was a surplus of over $1
billion. In early August an interagency committee on the balance of
payments had estimated that the trade balance would continue to show
large deficits for the remainder of this year and throughout 1972 --
averaging over $3 billion at an annual rate per quarter.
U.S. foreign trade. Any assessment at this time of the effect
on the U.S. trade balance of the recent actions taken by the President
can only be highly conjectural. A very rough guess of the effect of
the 10 per cent supplemental duty on imports would indicate that imports
in the fourth quarter of this year may be as much as $250 million (or
$1.0 billion at a seasonally adjusted annual rate) lower than they would
otherwise have been. Since the supplemental duty applies only to
dutiable imports (see Appendix A), most of this estimated decline will
be in imports of finished manufactures. It is unlikely that there will
be any improvement in exports during the remainder of the year as a
result of exchange rate changes; machinery exports, which would be a
major item affected, have a relatively long lead time.
The recent actions of the President can be placed against the
background of a rapidly deteriorating trade balance in the second
quarter -- the latest period for which data are available -- and
projections of worse to come.
The U.S. trade balance in the second quarter was a very large
deficit of $4.2 billion at a seasonally adjusted annual rate (balance-
of-payments basis), a sharp reversal of the moderate surplus of

IV -9
$1.1 billion recorded in the first quarter. This dramatic shift in our
trade position resulted from both a rapid acceleration in the rate of
increase in imports and an absolute decline in exports. Our trade
balance vis-à-vis all major areas deteriorated from the first to the
second quarters. Our export surplus with the Western European countries
virtually disappeared while our deficits with Canada and Japan widened.
While various special or temporary factors undoubtedly tended
to exaggerate the second quarter trade deficit, the underlying trend
was clearly adverse even after allowing for such factors.
Imports in the second quarter rose to $47.0 billion at a
seasonally adjusted annual rate (balance-of-payments basis), up over
9 per cent from the first-quarter level. This sharp increase in
imports far outpaced the rise in domestic economic activity. The
ratio of imports to GNP rose to 4.52 per cent in the second quarter
compared with 4.22 per cent in the first quarter. Import prices
rose less than the GNP deflator; thus in real terms, the increase in the
import/GNP ratio was even greater. The sharp increase in this ratio
in the second quarter was due mainly to the extraordinary rise in
imports of industrial materials. Such imports accounted for about
half of the increase in total imports.
Most of the rise in imports of industrial supplies was the
result of special factors: the hedgebuying of steel and aluminum in
anticipation of possible domestic strikes in these industries (which

IV -10
did not materialize), advance shipments of textiles and steel prior
to the imposition of "voluntary" restrictions by foreign countries on
their exports of these products, exceptionally large arrivals of
petroleum attributable to lower tanker rates and more liberal quotas,
accumulation of inventories in anticipation of the West Coast dock
strike and the possibility of an East and Gulf Coast strike later in
the year. However, about one-fourth of the rise in imports of
industrial materials is probably attributable to the need for building
materials and other industrial supplies as a result of the continuing
high level of housing starts and the moderate upturn in domestic
industrial production.
Further gains were made in the second quarter in imports of
consumer goods and automobiles, especially from Japan -- items which
had accounted for almost all of the increase in imports in the first
quarter of the year. Such imports also rose faster than domestic
consumption. Arrivals of foods -- mainly coffee and perhaps meat and
whiskey -- were heavy, possibly reflecting early purchases in anticipation
of the possible East and Gulf Coast dock strike this fall.
Exports in the second quarter were $44.0 billion at a sea-
sonally adjusted annual rate (balance-of-payments basis). This represents
a 3 per cent decline from the relatively high level of the first
quarter when shipments of agricultural products peaked, deliveries of
commercial aircraft were very high, and exports of automobiles and parts
to Canada recovered from the GM strike.

IV -11
In the second quarter, agricultural exports were 10 per cent
below the high first quarter level, and they are not expected to
improve during the rest of the year. Deliveries of aircraft in the
second quarter were higher than in the first quarter but schedules call
for a somewhat lower delivery rate in the remainder of the year.
Automotive exports to Canada were unchanged from the first quarter.
Exports, other than aircraft, agricultural products, and
automotive equipment to Canada, fell further in the second quarter,
continuing the steady decline in such exports which began in the third
quarter of 1970. This decline reflects the slowing in foreign economic
activity and the easing of pressure on supply capabilities abroad.

IV -12
Prices and wages in major industrial countries. Once a
basic realignment of exchange rates has been achieved and speculative
influences in the market (hopefully) eliminated, or at least greatly
diminished, relative price movements will again become a more overt
influence on balances of payments and conditions in the exchange
markets. In this connection, it is significant that wage and price
inflation remains a serious problem in almost all the major industrial
countries. Indeed, since the end of 1969, wholesale prices of
manufactured goods in six of the eight countries shown in the
accompanying table have risen faster than those in the United States;
weighted by exports of manufactured goods, the average rose at an
annual rate of 4.7 per cent from the last quarter 1969 to first
quarter 1971 compared to 3.0 per cent in the United States. The
relatively better price performance recently in the United States
presumably reflects greater slack in the use of productive capacity here
than in most foreign countries; even so, other.countries have improved
their foreign trade position in 1971 while ours has deteriorated.
So far in 1971, however, the rate of increase of wholesale
prices has been decelerating in several countries, although consumer
price rises have, generally, speeded up. (The difference between
the behavior of wholesale and retail prices is, of course, in part
the result of relatively more rapid increases in prices of services,
but also reflects the lag in movements between consumer and whole-
sale prices.) Inflation in both consumer and wholesale prices has

IV -13
intensified in the United Kingdom, France and Canada thus far in
1971, but price increases have decelerated in Japan. In Germany
price increases accelerated in the first quarter of 1971, but
slowed somewhat in the second. Italian prices have followed a
similar pattern, with sharp increases around year-end, followed
by a slightly improved situation in more recent months. Increases
in wage rates have accelerated thus far in 1971 only in Canada
and France. They have apparently slowed somewhat in the United
Kingdom, Germany and Japan, but damping their rise remains a
target of stabilization policy in virtually all countries.

Almost all of the major industrial countries seem to be
experiencing cost-push pressures. In some, conditions resemble
those in the United States, with wages and prices continuing to
increase rapidly in the absence of excessive aggregate demand and
capacity utilization. Inflation in the United Kingdom and Canada
is clearly almost entirely the result of cost pressures, and such
pressures are also an important element in the price advance in
Germany, France and Italy. Japan seems to have shown the most
progress in putting down inflation, but at the cost of producing
a near recession -- at least by Japanese standards. The rapid
rise in consumer prices in Belgium in 1971 is only partly the
result of changes in the tax system, as the Government has attempted
to delay some of these effects until later in the year.

The United Kingdom is the most clear-cut example of cost-
push inflation among the major industrial countries. Since 1969,
the United Kingdom has experienced very high unemployment, but
wages and prices have increased at rapid rates. Average earnings
rose at an annual rate in excess of 12 per cent throughout 1970
and have only recently slowed somewhat. The recent deceleration
stems in part from a decline in the length of the work week, which
provides less overtime at extra pay, and from a temporary reduction
in the number of new contracts coming up for renegotiation. The
government has had some success in restraining public employees'
unions and is developing a new incomes policy. However, consumer
price increases in excess of 10 per cent per year in recent months
will make government anti-inflation attempts more difficult as
unions attempt to maintain their members' real income levels.
The new incomes policy being developed is based on the
government's acceptance of a proposal by the Confederation of
British Industries that price increases be limited to 5 per cent
in the next year. The government has committed the nationalized
industries to this ceiling and it is hoped that this will result
in a reduction in inflationary expectations, which in turn will
encourage labor unions to reduce their demands. Wholesale prices
have been recently increasing at a rate of 8 per cent; thus, this
program, if successful, would result in a significant easing of
inflation. Although the Trade Unions Congress has not committed

IV -16
itself to a limit on wage increases, it has indicated that it will
take the CBI commitment into account in its contract negotiations.
In addition, the British government has recently announced a sales
tax reduction, designed to reduce consumer prices while contributing
to the reflation of the economy.
Canada is also experiencing severe cost-push inflation
accompanied by weak demand. Unemployment is 6.4 per cent, only
slightly below the 1970 peak of 6.7 per cent, but wage and price
increases are accelerating. After an encouraging price performance
in 1970, government attempts to reflate the economy coupled with
continued price increases in the United States have rekindled
inflationary expectations. During 1970, Canadian wholesale prices
rose by less than one-half of a percentage point, in part because
of the appreciation of the Canadian dollar, but during the first half
of 1971, they spurted at an annual rate of 3.7 per cent. The rate
of increase of consumer prices declined from quarter to quarter
throughout 1970, and the level of the index actually fell slightly
in the fourth quarter. In the first six months of this year,
however, consumer prices increased again, reaching an annual rate
of 5.7 per cent in the second quarter. Reports of major collective
bargaining settlements show a slight jump in the rate of wage
increases from 7.0 per cent in the first quarter of 1971 to 7.5 per
cent in the second quarter, with average increases fornew contracts
in June reaching 8.3 per cent. Attempts by the Canadian government

IV -17
in 1970 to apply a voluntary system of wage-price guidelines failed
owing to a lack of cooperation by labor unions, and these guidelines
were dropped last December. The Prices and Incomes Commission
remains in existence, however, and is reporting on inflationary
wage and price developments in specific sectors of the economy,
In Germany, both excess demand pressures and the exceedingly
high rates of inflation which accompanied high capacity utilization
seem to be abating slowly, but inflation is still well above a rate
considered acceptable by the authorities.
Capacity utilization remains quite high, but restrictive
economic policies have begun to show some effect. The capital
investment boom has been tailing off for some time, and the German
economy has moved into a period in which consumption is the: ain
driving force. Gross personal income is likely to grow somewhat
more slowly -- and may have begun to do so already -- as hours
worked have been reduced and wage settlements, though still large,
have been a bit more moderate than in preceding months. However,
some of the effect on spendable income is being offset by the
lifting of the surcharge on income taxes this summer.
Still, price movements have moderated somewhat as demand
pressures have receded. The rise in the wholesale price index has
slowed from an annual rate of 4.8 per cent in the fourth quarter of
1970 to 4.0 per cent in recent months. (The high first quarter
increase was at least partly seasonal.) This movement reflected

IV -18
mainly a slowing of price rises for capital goods. However, the
rise in the consumer price index continues virtually unabated,
especially for nonfood items.
Thus, the situation in Germany now also reflects a strong
element of cost-push inflation and the Government faces the con-
tinuing problem of restraining inflation despite the apparent easing
of demand pressures. Monetary policy has been tightened further
in recent months and can be more effective since the floating of
the DM, and tighter government expenditure policy has attempted
to offset the easing effect of the removal of the income tax sur-
charges. In addition, the Government hopes that its voluntary wage-
incomes policy will be more effective than it has been in past
months. Although the "Concerted Action," which brings together
representatives of labor, management and government, has not been
able hitherto to contain wage and price movements within the guidelines
set by the Government, there now is some evidence that it is making
a more significant contribution.
The French economy has not suffered from excess demand
pressures for at least a year, and is currently operating at
significantly less than full capacity. However, wages and prices
have continued to increase and have accelerated in recent months.
Wage rates rose at an annual rate of 13 per cent in the second quarter
of 1971 despite a relatively high unemployment rate of 2.5 per cent.
Consumer prices have been increasing at an annual rate of about

IV -19
6 per cent in recent months and the rate of increase of wholesale
prices has recently been 8.1 per cent. Some of the price increase,
however, is related to the 1969 exchange rate changes.
The French government has indicated that it will tighten
price controls or even impose a price freeze if the pace of inflation
is not reduced. The resistance of employers to union demands has
apparently been weakened by the memory of the disturbances of May 1968,
so the prospects for a slowing of inflation -- certainly without
further government action -- are not encouraging.
The Italian economy, in addition to its socio-political
problems which obscure all economic trends, is also suffering from
a fairly serious case of cost-push inflation. Price increases have
slowed somewhat in recent months, but the period since mid-1969 has
produced the most rapid inflation over a comparable period since 1947.
Prior to the summer of 1970, excess demand was an important factor in
the Italian inflation, but since then a weakening of aggregate demand
has occurred which has left the economy with some excess capacity.
Despite the easing of demand pressures, wage rates continued to
increase rapidly, at least through the end of 1970 (data for 1971
are not available). Although wholesale and consumer prices rose
sharply in the first quarter of 1971, at annual rates of 4 and more
than 7 per cent respectively, they have since decelerated.
Belgian prices rose quite rapidly in 1970, and the decline
in the wholesale price index thus far in 1971 may be more apparent

IV -20
than real. Belgium underwent a major tax reform, replacing a turnover
tax with a value-added tax system at the beginning of 1971, and this
change seems to have reduced wholesale prices and raised consumer prices.
Since the tax reform, however, wholesale prices have been stable as a
result of the leveling off of raw materials and import prices.
Consumer prices increased at an annual rate of 6 per cent
through May, and only part of this increase can be attributed to the
tax change. Its effect on consumer prices is expected to total about
2 per cent, most of which is expected in the second half of the year
when the government-enforced delays in many consumer price increases
expire. The Belgian economy is operating at full capacity; consequently,
current wage and price pressures can be attributed more to the pull of
aggregate demand than the push of cost increases.
In Japan, inflation is apparently subsiding because of the
slowdown in the economy. Consumer prices increased at an annual rate
of 4.8 per cent in the first half of 1971 compared with 8.3 per cent
during all of 1970. Wholesale prices declined after October 1970 and
during the first quarter of 1971, and were virtually unchanged in the
following three months. Wages increased rapidly during most of 1970,
but have been less buoyant recently. The relative softness of the
economy suggests that most of the remaining wage and price pressures
may be either a lagged response to excessive demand in the past or the
result of cost-push influences. The significant deceleration of infla-
tion as demand pressures have subsided suggests, however, that Japan has
less of a problem of cost-push inflation than exists in many other
industrial countries,

APPENDIX A: PRESIDENT'S PROCLAMATION ON SUPPLEMENTAL IMPORT DUTIES
President Nixon's proclamation of August 15 imposed a supple-
mental duty of 10 per cent ad valorem on all dutiable imports which
clear customs after 12:01 AM August 16, 1971. Approximately one-half
of total imports are subject to this additional duty. The supplemental
duty does not apply to duty-free items, such as automotive equipment
from Canada, coffee, and industrial raw materials, to items not subject
to trade concessions, and to commodities subject to absolute quotas
imposed by law or agreement. Exempt items in the last category include
meat, sugar, dairy products, crude oil, and petroleum products. Cotton
textiles are exempt, at least up to now, from the additional duty, but
imports of items that are limited by "voluntary" restraints by foreign
suppliers, such as steel, are covered.
If the imposition of the additional duty of 10 per cent would
cause the total duty to exceed the original duty rate prescribed by the
Tariff Act of 1930, then the duty rate of the Tariff Act would apply.
The major example of this is automobiles from Europe and Japan. The
present duty on cars, other than from Canada, is 3-1/2 per cent ad
valorem. Imposition of the additional 10 per cent stipulated in
President Nixon's proclamation would raise the total duty rate to
13-1/2 per cent. The duty rate under the Tariff Act of 1930 is 10 per
cent and this, therefore, is the maximum that would apply to cars
under the President's proclamation, or an increase of 6-1/2 per cent.
There are other items of this type but imports of such items are much
less important than automobile imports. More than offsetting the
effect on cars of the imposition of the supplemental duty would be
the removal of the 7 per cent excise tax on autos which is also applicable
to imported cars. As a result of both these actions, prices of
European and Japanese cars would actually be reduced, though they
would rise relative to domestically-produced cars.
In essence the President's proclamation modifies the tariff
concessions made under previous trade agreements, and is based on the
authority vested to the President by the Tariff Act of 1930 and the
Trade Expansion Act of 1962.
Despite the price freeze on domestically produced items,
prices of imported goods would be allowed to rise by the full amount
of the additional duty imposed. Prices of items assembled or produced
in the United States with foreign components would also be allowed to
rise by the amount of the additional duty levied on the foreign
components. According to the Treasury Department, however, it has been
initially decided not to exempt from the price freeze the higher cost
of imported goods -- either complete units or components -- resulting
from changes in the exchange rate for the dollar, but a final decision
on this has not been made.
