SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK
Nonfinancial
Economic data relating to the period following mid-August
announcement of the new economic program suggest that, on balance,
activity was gaining momentum at the end of the quarter and increases
in average prices and wages had moderated significantly. For the third
quarter as a whole, however, real GNP is still estimated to have
increased at about a 2 per cent annual rate, well below the second-
quarter increase.
In September the labor market firmed; nonfarm payroll employ-
ment increased sharply, fairly large gains were reported in most
manufacturing industries, and the unemployment rate edged down to 6.0
per cent following increases in the two previous months. However, the
average work week in manufacturing industries declined further. The
industrial production index is estimated to have risen somewhat in
September, reflecting in part recovery in steel production, and in-
creased business equipment and consumer goods output.
Sales of domestic-type automobiles continued strong in late
September and for the month as a whole were about 12 per cent above
the August rate, apparently reflecting the expected cut in the excise
tax and possible price increases after mid-November. Sales of imports,
which rose to record levels in August, fell back last month, apparently
due to a shortage of supplies resulting from the West Coast dock strike.

I- 2
Most chain and department stores reported strong sales in September, and
total retail sales are estimated to have increased by 0.6 per cent
during the month.
New orders for durable goods advanced in August in all
categories except defense and primary metals; excluding these groups
orders were an impressive 5 per cent above the second-quarter average.
New orders exceeded shipments in August for the first month in some
time.
The wholesale price index, seasonally adjusted, fell
appreciably between August and September. Although most of the decline
reflected a reduction in prices of farm and food products, prices of
industrial commodities also moved lower for the first time since mid-
1964. Average hourly earnings for the private nonfarm economy, seasonally
adjusted, levelled off in September. In manufacturing, trade and
services, the year-over-year increases in hourly earnings were well
below those of other recent months.
Outlook. Real GNP is now projected to rise at an annual rate
of about 7 per cent in the fourth quarter, a somewhat faster pace than
previously anticipated. The projection has been raised because of the
apparent recent strengthening of consumer spending, a shift in the
assumed date of the military pay increase from January 1 to mid-November,
and the enhanced probability that the tax benefits enacted by Congress
will be effective earlier and will be larger than the Administration

I-3
recommended. The GNP deflator should increase less than during the
third quarter, although some flurry of price increases seems probable
after mid-November.
In the first half of next year real GNP is projected to
rise at an average rate of about 7.5 per cent. Because of the large
expected increase in final sales, and in particular the anticipated
need of the auto industry to replenish depleted stocks, inventory
investment is expected to increase appreciably. Business fixed invest-
ment should also begin to move up as real growth accelerates and businesses
begin to take increasing advantage of the investment tax credit. Con-
sumer spending is likely to be strengthened further by rising disposable
income, reflecting increases in employment and hours of work, and--if
the House tax bill becomes law--substantially larger tax refunds in the
first half of next year than previously had been anticipated. The new
programs are also expected to result in a shift from deficit to surplus
in net exports of goods and services.
We have assumed that the President's program will keep price
increases in the private sectors in the range of 2.5 -3.0 per cent.
The gains in real GNP we have projected in the first half of next year
should result in both large gains in productivity and a substantial
increase in employment. However, we also expect a sizable increase in
the labor force. On balance, the unemployment rate is projected to
decline to 5.5 per cent in the second quarter of 1972.

I-4
Financial
Recent Developments. Since the last Committee meeting,
interest rates in both short- and long-term markets have declined
roughly 1/8 to 1/4 of 1 percentage point, and most market rates are
now at their lowest level since the President's mid-August speech.
Most of the decline occurred before the announcement of the Administration's
post-freeze plan in early October as market participants apparently
had discounted the market impact of the program. In addition, slackened
growth in key monetary aggregates along with declines in the Federal
funds rate had generated market expectations of an easier monetary policy.
Growth in total loans and investments at commercial banks
slowed during September from the rapid August rate. Business loan
growth was sharply reduced from the month earlier when demands had been
bolstered by developments in foreign exchange markets. But real estate
and consumer loans continued to expand briskly, and banks added appreci-
ably to their holdings of municipal securities.
Banks financed their September credit growth mainly by selling
negotiable CD's. Consumer-type time and savings deposits at commercial
banks rose at about the same moderate rate as in August. On the other
hand, net inflows of deposits at nonbank thrift institutions accelerated.
This faster deposit growth, together with Government mortgage support
programs appears to have stabilized yields on home mortgages in
September.

I-5
Outlook. If economic activity accelerates as projected during
the fourth quarter, credit demands in short-term markets are likely to
expand further in light of consumer and business financing needs. Also,
sizeable Treasury and Federal agency demands are in prospect, although
their cash needs are expected to be only $2-1/2 billion larger than
seasonal--and less than a year ago--assuming no appreciable drain on
Treasury cash from reductions in official foreign accounts. Part of
their demands will fall on commercial banks who may rely to a considerable
extent on CD sales for funds, given the outlook for only modest growth
in other sources.
Upward rate tendencies in short-term markets, which usually
occur anyway in the fourth quarter, could develop in this environment,
with possible feedback effect on long-term rates. On the other hand,
upward rate pressures could be offset by continuing favorable public
assessment of the post-freeze program. Moreover, long-term interest
rates will be under reduced pressure because credit demands in such
markets probably will be smaller than earlier this year. Corporate
bond offerings are expected to taper off in association with further
improvements in internal funds generation. State and local government
bond issues might also recede following the flotation of some previously
postponed issues in September.
Mortgage rates might ease with the seasonal decline in
mortgage credit demands, given continuing strong Government support

I -6
programs, especially through FNMA and GNMA, and ample cash flows of
funds at thrift institutions. The volume of financial saving is
expected to remain large despite some pick-up in consumer spending,
and developments in securities markets do not suggest any appreciable,
further shift in fund flows away from financial institutions.
Balance of payments
The U. S. foreign trade position in August was again heavily
in deficit, and it is expected that September results will prove to have
been similar. Three kinds of factors were responsible for the $4
billion annual rate of trade deficit in April-August. Some part of the
adverse balance resulted from underlying factors of deterioration in
the U. S, trade position, including not only U. S. competitive diffi-
culties with manufactured products but also structural elements such
as the growing requirement for petroleum imports. Some part was due
to cyclical weakness in aggregate demand in Japan and other foreign
countries. A third part was due to temporary factors, such as
anticipation of the East Coast port strike which began this month.
In the current (fourth) quarter, a more favorable position with respect
to the last of these categories should bring some narrowing of the
trade deficit, as will the effects of the temporary import surcharge.
Further improvement as a result of exchange rate changes and the U. S.
wage and price control programs may become visible next year, if not
sooner.

I-7
Cyclical factors here and abroad may work against the expected
improvement in the foreign trade balance next year, keeping the gains
less than they might otherwise be. While some acceleration in aggregate
demand may occur in Britain, Japan, and Canada, helping U. S. exports,
such developments might not outweigh the effects of rising U. S.
activity and income on U. S. imports. Meanwhile, in continental
Western Europe a period of generally slow real GNP growth may be
setting in, bringing some further easing of supply positions in Europe.
Whereas the slowdown in growth that started in the spring of 1970
eased demand-supply conditions at first mainly for steel and other
industrial materials, this year such effects are being felt in markets
for machinery and equipment.
Under present conditions of controlled floating of exchange
rates, statistics of the over-all U. S. balance of payments position
are of limited significance. The September official settlements
deficit was about $1-1/2 billion. Apparently there were still some
sizable short-term capital outflows in September, though not on the
August scale. No big reflows of speculative funds have been evident--
though a sharp drop has occurred in Euro-dollar interest rates.
The continuing tendency for the United States to have a
deficit in the underlying payments position can be met with four sorts
of reactions, with varying results for reserves and exchange rates.

I-8
There may be further appreciations of some foreign currencies, with
temporary shifts of private funds balancing the accounts until other
adjustments occur. Or some countries may choose to acquire additional
official dollar reserves, even though the dollars are inconvertible
and of uncertain future value in foreign currency terms. Or there
may be a further proliferation of measures to restrict capital inflows
taken by foreign countries trying to avoid either of the first two
courses. Lastly, there continues to be a danger that foreign dis-
satisfaction with the present situation, accentuated by unhappiness
about the U. S. surcharge and the discriminatory feature of the
investment tax credit, may bring retaliation in such forms as export
subsidies.

THE ECONOMIC PICTURE IN DETAIL
Domestic Nonfinancial Scene
Gross national product. Our current estimate of GNP for the
third quarter is little changed from the projection of four weeks ago.
A rise of $15 billion, annual rate, is now indicated, $1 billion less
than last time. In real terms, economic activity is now estimated to
have risen at an annual rate of about 1.7 per cent, with the GNP deflator
up about 4 per cent, annual rate. (The official OBE estimate for the
third quarter should be available by the end of the week.)
Our previous estimate of inventory investment in the third
quarter has been reduced $1 billion to $2.7 billion; manufacturers con-
tinued to liquidate inventories in August. Sales of domestic-type autos
rose sharply in September, while production was about unchanged. Our
earlier estimate of net exports of goods and services has been revised
down by $1 billion to a minus $2.0 billion because of further deteriora-
tion in foreign trade in July and August. State and local government
expenditures have been pared by $.5 billion because their construction
outlays have failed to expand as anticipated. But largely offsetting
these downward revisions are upward revisions in outlays for residential
construction and personal consumption.
The current projection of GNP and its components for the
final quarter of this year and the first two quarters of next year is
based on the assumptions underlying our previous projection with these

rate, of voluntary army pay increase,
--the effective date of the military pay increase associated
with the volunteer army is shifted to November 15th in line with the
recently enacted legislation and with the end of Phase I of the price-
wage freeze.
--the provisions of the House-passed Revenue Act of 1971,
which contains some modifications, have been substituted for the Admini-
stration-proposed version. These provisions are discussed in the
financial section of the Greenbook.

II -3
Advancing the starting date of the military pay increase
associated with the volunteer army to November 15 would raise the in-
crease previously projected for the fourth quarter for Federal government
defense spending, and personal income, by $1.2 billion, annual rate.
The increase in defense purchases and personal income in the first
quarter of next year would also be $1.2 billion when the balance of the
pay increase becomes effective. Thus, the first quarter increase is
$1.2 billion smaller than projected previously.
The additional liberalizations in Federal personal income tax
liabilities passed by the House, retroactive to the beginning of this
year, would also result in sizable increases in disposable personal in-
come in the current and next two quarters. These increases in income
are expected to induce somewhat larger gains in consumption expenditures
than we had previously projected in each of the three quarters involved.
We have held to our assumption that business fixed investment
through mid-1972 would be mainly influenced by actual and prospective
capacity utilization rates. Therefore, we have not changed our projected
figures for the period despite the reduction in our tax credit benefit
assumption.
Besides the revisions in Federal defense outlays and personal
consumption expenditures in the fourth quarter of this year and the
first two quarters of next year because of changes in the underlying
assumptions, we have modified slightly the pattern of residential con-
struction outlays and business inventory investment as indicated in the
text tables.

The effect of these modifications is to strengthen the sub-
stantial expansion previously indicated for these three quarters. The
annual rate of real change through mid-1972 now averages 7-1/4 per cent
per year with a price rise assumed to be in a range of about 2-1/2 to 3
per cent per year.
The stronger economic picture now projected seems likely to
result in slightly larger gains in employment, and also in the labor
force. We continue to anticipate an acceleration in output per manhour

in the first half of next year. On balance, we project that the un-
employment rate will decline to around 5-1/2 per cent by the second
quarter.
Industrial production. The industrial production index is
expected to rise about 0.5 per cent in September from the reduced level
of 105.2 for August. The third quarter average is estimated to be
1 per cent lower than the second quarter and 5-1/2 per cent below the
peak quarter in the autumn of 1969.
In addition to a partial recovery in steel production in Sep-
tember, it is likely that output of both consumer goods and business
equipment rose somewhat, while defense equipment fell off further. Auto
assemblies have remained at the 8.5 million rate prevailing in recent
months, after allowing for the new model seasonal changeovers. October
auto output schedules continue at that level as the industry regards
present fourth quarter schedules as already high. Production of appliances
and TV sets has been reduced since mid-year as factory and distributors'
stocks have increased considerably since last spring, while output of
consumer non-durable goods has risen further.
In early October steel production has leveled off following
a sharp rise in September from a level of operations that has been re-
duced by 10 per cent from the preliminary August estimates. The leveling
off in steel rolling mill operations and a 3 per cent decline in raw
steel output in the first week of October has reflected, first, the
earlier replenishment of steel mill shipping stock and, second, little

II -6
recovery so far in demands from major steel consuming industries--
although their rate of inventory liquidation must be quite high. Some
industry sources have pushed back their expectations of a renewed volume
of steel buying and mill operations from the fourth quarter to the early
part of 1972.
Capacity utilization. The Federal Reserve series for manu-
facturing capacity and capacity utilization have been revised in line
with the revised industrial production index. The revisions resulted in
raising moderately the levels of capacity utilization since 1966, with
the largest revision of around three percentage points upward in the
period from the second quarter of 1967 to the first quarter of 1969. In
the first half of 1971, the revised capacity utilization rate has been
raised about 1.5 percentage points above the old level.
The increases in the total manufacturing series were largely
the result of the fact that the revised production index grew more
rapidly during this period than the unrevised index. While the revision
increased the level of manufacturing capacity utilization in recent
years, it left quarterly patterns virtually unchanged. After peaking at
91 per cent in the second and third quarters of 1966, the rates have
declined from 87 per cent in the third quarter of 1969 to an estimated
73 per cent in the third quarter of 1971.

Retail sales. Advance data suggest that the stronger sales
pace which became evident in early spring was sustained in September,
with sales rising 0.6 per cent from August and 9.4 per cent from a year
earlier. As was generally true in earlier months, most of the additional
push was from sales of the automotive group which increased 4.4 per cent
from August. Sales of durable goods as a whole increased 2.4 per cent,
as higher auto sales were offset to some extent by lower sales of
furniture and appliances. Nondurable goods sales were vitually unchanged,
as a marginal gain in general merchandise sales failed to offset declines
in most other nondurable sales.
The retail sales series will be revised shortly to reflect new
seasonal factors. As a result, the second month sample count for August
which is usually available at this time has not yet been released.

Unit auto sales and stocks. Sales of new domestic-type autos
were maintained at the stepped-up pace noted since the announcement of
the President's economic programs. Sales reached a 9.5 million unit
rate for the month of September, up 12 per cent from August and 38
per cent from a year earlier, which was affected by general economic
conditions and the consumer belief that GM cars were not available because
of the strike. Stocks of new domestic-type cars at the end of September
were placed at a 52-day supply down 16 per cent from last month and 22
per cent from last year.
Due to the earlier and more rapid production change-over for
the model year and to the pre-introduction sales of the new models,
seasonal factors for sales of domestic type autos have been changed back
to mid August.

September sales of foreign cars fell to an annual rate of
1.3 million units, down 26 per cent from last month's record high but
still 14 per cent above last year, primarily the result of the prolonged
West Coast dock strike which depleted inventories. The import share of
the US auto market was less than 15 per cent in September, below the 22
per cent in August and the 16 per cent of last September. In addition
to the effects of the West Coast dock strike, the smaller share reflected
a seasonal movement wherein the share of domestic-type sales usually
increase in September when new models are introduced.

The Michigan and Conference Board Surveys of Consumer Demand.
No significant change in consumer attitudes and purchase plans occured
in the regularly repeated questions in the September Michigan Survey
Research Center (SRC) survey and the August Conference Board survey.
However, special questions added to the SRC survey indicated that re-
spondents were overwhelmingly in favor of the freeze and that the continued

II -10
pessimism recorded in the standard questions was closely correlated
with uncertainty about the likely success of the Government in controlling
both unemployment and inflation. Nonetheless, the SRC survey does
suggest more favorable evaluations of buying conditions for durable goods,
particularly autos, and both independent surveys indicate a high demand
for homes.
The SRC index of consumer sentiment was little changed in
September at 82.4 (Feb. 1966=100), compared with 81.6 in May and up only
modestly from an historical low of 75.4 in May 1970. The slight increase
in the index, which is composed of four questions on expected and present
business and financial conditions and a fifth question on market con-
ditions for durable goods, was attributable to more favorable evaluations
of the prices of household durables--particularly autos. This improve-
ment was largely offset by some deterioration in respondents' appraisal
of their present personal financial situations and continued concern
about future personal income and business conditions.
Additional special questions in the SRC survey disclosed
that respondents were still more concerned about unemployment than in-
flation and that slightly more respondents thought the Administration
would be unsuccessful than successful in attacking these dual problems.
In the short term, nonetheless, households expect price stability with
fully 54 per cent of the respondents' answering that the freeze would be
extended in its present form after the initial 90 day period and the
favorable evaluations of market conditions for cars largely associated

II -11
with prices are "low and good buys available" rather than the response
favored in the previous survey--"prices are likely to go higher."
The Conference Board survey taken in August, after the price-
wage freeze, reported buying plans for new autos unchanged from May and
a year earlier and lower purchase plans for major appliances, both
compared with the last survey and a year earlier. Income expectations
fell back to their January level and other attitudinal questions on
present and expected business and employment conditions were about what
they were in the previous two or three surveys.
Cyclical indicators. The preliminary Census composite leading
indicator declined 1 per cent in August, after a July increase of
1.7 per cent. The decline resulted from decreases in the manufacturing
workweek, new orders for durable goods, common stock prices, the ratio
of price to unit labor cost, and housing permits, and an increase in
initial claims for unemployment insurance (which is treated inversely
in the composite index). To some extent this decline reflected the post-
contract rundown of steel stockpiles, but in a similar month--August 1968--
the leading composite rose. The improvement in common stock prices
which followed the announcement of the new economic policy was not
sufficient to raise the August monthly average above July, but it will
be reflected in the September composite. Leading series increasing in
August were contracts and orders for plant and equipment and industrial
materials prices; the latter increased further in September. (Most of
the raw industrial materials such as metal scrap which make up this

II -12
materials price index are still below their May 1970 levels, and the
freeze allows them to rise to those levels.)

Manufacturers' orders and shipments. New orders for durable
goods declined 0.7 per cent in August, according to preliminary data,
after rising 3.4 per cent in July. The decline was all in defense
products and primary metals; excluding those groups, orders rose 4
per cent in August and were 5 per cent above the second-quarter average.

The decline in iron and steel orders was quite similar in
amount to the post-labor-contract decline in August 1968, but this year
steel shipments dropped more sharply than in 1968 and fell below the
volume of incoming orders, and steel order backlogs rose. In August
1968 order backlogs were still declining. The deep cut in shipments,
along with some other evidence such as steel production and inventory
data, suggests that as of the end of August there has been a deeper,
faster rundown of steel stocks than in 1968, but the fact that new
orders declined no further than in 1968 and unfilled orders rose instead
of declining may be indications of somewhat earlier reordering than
might otherwise have been expected.

II -14
Orders for motor vehicles and parts, household durables, and
capital equipment improved in August, though orders for capital equip-
ment are still below their June high. The August increase in "other
durables" was mainly in the "other fabricated metals" group which is a
heavy supplier to the auto industry.
Shipments of durable goods declined 2 per cent in August,
as the sharp drop in steel shipments outweighed a 3 per cent increase
elsewhere; there were increases for all other major categories. The
backlog of unfilled orders rose at most major groups, including (as
already noted) iron and steel.
Inventories. Book value of business inventories rose at an
$8.1 billion annual rate in August, double the July rate and somewhat
higher than in the first half of 1971. The runoff of steel inventories
in August, reflected in declines in related areas of both manufacturing
and wholesale trade, was more than offset by a high rate of stockbuilding
at retail auto dealers and an accelerated rate of increase in other
areas. (In September, new domestic auto sales exceeded production and
unit stocks declined.)
The business inventory-sales ratio rose slightly in August,
but this was mainly a result of the sharp drop in steel shipments.
Elsewhere, ratios changed little, and many were well below year-earlier
levels.

Both the book value data for total materials stocks at
durable goods manufacturers and tonnage data on inventories of steel
mill shapes indicate that while this year's steel stockpile relative to
steel requirements was larger than in 1968, the rundown of the stock-
pile has been more rapid than in the previous steel contract year.

II -16
Compared with shipments of durable goods other than materials ("end
products"), durable manufacturers' stocks of both materials and end
products appear in better shape than in the last steel rundown.
Compared with unfilled orders, stocks are still very high, but the
ratios have at least leveled off.

Construction and real estate. Seasonally adjusted outlays for
new construction, which were revised upward by 2 per cent to a new high
for August, expanded further in September to almost the $110 billion
mark. Benefiting from the unprecedented 2.2 million unit rate of housing
starts in July and August, expenditures for residential construction

II -17
continued to dominate the over-all advance, at a rate more than 60
per cent above the low in July of 1970.
Outlays for private nonresidential construction apparently
edged higher in September and about matched the previous record rate
established last April. While expenditures for public construction also
tended upward in September, the rise was limited to federally owned
projects, and the combined public construction rate remained moderately
below the recent peak reached in the first quarter of the year.
Construction costs apparently changed little in September,
based on tentative Census Bureau indications. However, on a year-to-
year basis, the increase amounted to 9 per cent. This was about the
same as the exceptional average annual increase in such costs during
1970 and accounted for nearly half the year-to-year rise in total
current dollar outlays in September.
Underscoring the strength of housing demands this past summer,
sales of existing homes in August--the latest month for which data are
available--continued about a fifth above the rising level a year earlier,
according to the National Association of Real Estate Boards. The median
price of such homes showed little change at a level of $25,300 or 8
per cent above a year earlier. This compared with an average year-
over-year increase of 6 per cent in 1970 as a whole, when mortgage terms
were less favorable and the mix of effective demands was relatively
more concentrated in smaller and less expensive types of units.

Labor market. There appears to have been some strengthening
recently in the labor market. Seasonally adjusted nonfarm payroll
employment rose 300,000 over the month after showing little change during
the summer. Reflecting these employment gains, the unemployment rate
edged down 0.1 percentage point in September to 6.0 per cent, seasonally
adjusted, even though the labor force expanded appreciably.

II -19
Payroll employment. After declining steadily since May,
employment rose sharply in manufacturing in September, with gains wide-
spread, particularly in both electrical and non-electrical machinery
and fabricated metals industries. All of the increase took place among
production workers. Increasesin employment were also reported in most
nonmanufacturing industries. The number of employees on nonfarm pay-
rolls has increased by 360,000 from a year ago, but is still little
changed from May 1971 levels. Most of the year-to-year increase in
employment has been in trade, services and State and local government;
partially offsetting this gain was a decline of over 600,000 in factory
employment,
While employment was expanding last month, average hours worked
in manufacturing fell for the second month to 39.6 hours, seasonally
adjusted, the lowest level this year. Declines in weekly hours were
widespread with the largest decline in the auto industry.

Unemployment and labor force. The unemployment rates for
adult men and teenagers were unchanged in September and about the
same as in May. The rate for adult women, however, declined during the
month reflecting a large increase in their employment. The unemploy-
ment rate for Negroes and other races, which has been fluctuating widely
during the year, rose 0.7 percentage points to 10.5 per cent while the
rate for whites declined, returning the nonwhite-to-white unemployment
ratio closer to its longer run ratio of two to one. Except for June
and July, where seasonal factors were difficult to interpret, total
unemployment has shown little change throughout most of the year.

The strengthening in the demand for labor is apparently
stimulating growth of the civilian labor force. During the second quarter
of 1971, the civilian labor force averaged only about 1.1 million higher
than a year ago, well below the large increases of 1969 and early 1970.

II -21
Since July, however, labor force growth has picked up, with a substantial
proportion occurring among adult men. The increase in labor force has
been associated with a rise in total employment while unemployment has
shown little change.

Wages. Average hourly earnings of production and
nonsupervisory workers on private nonfarm payrolls appear to have
levelled off in the month following the wage-price freeze. The
average unadjusted increase from August to September is usually
sizable because young people who tend to be concentrated in low
paying jobs are returning to school. The 3-cent increase in
September was smaller than usual and, after seasonal adjustment,
hourly earnings declined one-cent to $3.45 in the private sector.
Compared with a year earlier, the increase was 5.8 per cent, a
somewhat smaller gain than in either July or August. In most
industries, average hourly earnings in September advanced more
moderately from a year earlier than in the first half of the year.

Industrial relations. Bituminous coal miners and East Coast
longshoremen went on strike when their contracts expired before a new
agreement was negotiated. With no immediate prospect of an end to the

II -23
West Coast dock strike which has been in effect since July 1, the
President set in motion procedures under the Taft-Hartley Act to
enjoin the strike for an 80-day "cooling-off" period. Both the
West Coast and Chicago dock workers--the latter represented by the
Grain Elevator Operators union--returned to work on October 8 and 9
following issuance of temporary restraining orders.
In the West Coast negotiations, the longshoremen's union
was unable to obtain agreement to extend its jurisdiction to include
the loading and unloading of containers within 50-miles of the pier
--work usually done by the teamsters union. Other demands include a
40-hour workweek guarantee for regular members, improved pensions
and a wage increase. The Pacific Maritime Association has reportedly
offered a 34.7 per cent wage increase over a three year contract, or
about 10.5 per cent compounded annually. The East Coast longshoremen
have stated that they consider the offer by the Pacific Maritime
Association to be a floor under their wage demand. The immediate
cause of the East Coast strike was the New York Shipping Association's
refusal to continue to guarantee 2,080 hours of work annually after
expiration of the old contract unless the union made certain concessions
which would reduce the employment costs and remedy the alleged union
abuses. There appears to have been little negotiation, so far, on new
contracts covering 45,000 workers at Atlantic and Gulf ports.
In negotiations between the bituminous coal operators and
the 80,000 member union, the miners are reportedly seeking a 35 per
cent wage increase over a 3 year contract, an increase from 40 to 80

II -24
cents a ton in the employer's payment to the pension fund. The
railroads and 90,000 members of shopcraft unions have reached
agreement on a new 30-month contract retroactive to the first of
the year which is reported to provide a wage increase of about
10.5 per cent a year.
Consumer prices. Consumer prices rose in August at a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.2 per cent which reflects, in
the main, price changes before the August freeze. While nonfood
commodity prices showed an accelerated increase, largely attributable
to the sharp rise for gasoline, food and service prices rose at
rates similar to those in July. The indexes for September and sub-
sequent months, although expected to show substantially smaller
increases than in August, are likely to be only partial indicators
of the effects of the freeze.

The increase for nonfood commodities in August reflects a
one-month jump of 3.7 per cent to a level slightly above the January
high. Apparel and new car prices dropped somewhat more than seasonally,
the latter after three months of not following the usual downward
movement. Recent increases in service prices excluding home financing
costs have been smaller than in 1970 and the early months of this
year.

Impact of the price freeze on the CPI. To aid in analysis
of post-freeze price developments, BLS will attempt to evaluate the
effect on the September index of such factors as exempted items,
including imports and taxes, and price comparisons which reflect in
whole or in part price changes before August. This is not expected to
result in a definitive estimate of the effect of the freeze on consumer
prices.

II -26
Even if all frozen prices are unchanged there is a major
source of possible increases in the September and, to a lesser
extent the October, index deriving from the three-month rotation
schedule for pricing most non-food items outside the five largest
cities. The September index will include price changes since June,
and the October index since July, for the cities regularly priced
in these months. Other components, such as rent and property taxes,
are priced less frequently or, in the case of used cars and houses,
are represented by three-month moving averages.
Food is priced monthly in all cities but usually during the
first week of the month, so that the September index will reflect
price changes since early in August, before the freeze. Items exempted
from the freeze--including fresh fruits and vegetables, eggs, mortgage
rates and property taxes--represent nearly 10 per cent of the CPI
market basket. (The mortgage cost component of the CPI, however,
also reflects changes in house prices, which are not exempt). Accord-
ing to BLS estimates, tax changes (including sales taxes) accounted for
about one-tenth of the .3 per cent (unadjusted) increase in the August
CPI. Increases in prices of imported finished goods affect the CPI
to the extent they are priced, but they may well be under-represented.
Seasonal adjustment factors in September and October may
offset much of the upward trend in other prices (outside the scope of
the above BLS evaluation). The factor for new cars is 4.5 index
points higher in October than in September, while that for apparel

II -27
commodities increases 1.2 index points in September and .5 index
points in October. Unless permitted seasonal price increases are
of this order of magnitude, these seasonally adjusted components
could show an important decline and the effect on the index could
be substantial. In addition, the annual adjustment in the medical
services index (presumably downwards) usually occurs in October.
Removal of the auto excise tax is expected to have a signif-
icant impact on the CPI, as indicated by the BLS estimate for the
refund of taxes on one American make of automobiles, in advance of
Congressional approval, to purchasers of new cars after August 15.
This accounted for about one-third of the .8 per cent (unadjusted)
price decline in the August index for new cars.
The net effect of all these factors is difficult to evaluate;
however, assuming that food prices decline about seasonally, as
anticipated, there could be a net decline in the seasonally-adjusted
index in September or October. This seems more likely if the removal
of the excise tax coincides with the period of normal seasonal rise
for autos.

II -28
Wholesale prices. The wholesale price index declined between
August and September at a seasonally-adjusted annual rate of 4.7 per
cent--the first decline since November 1970 and the largest monthly
decline since October 1966. The BLS reported that two-thirds of the
decline in the overall WPI (unadjusted) was accounted for by price
decreases for raw agricultural products and some imported commodities
which are not covered by the President's stabilization program. A
large drop in prices of farm and food products was mainly responsible
for the decline in the WPI. Prices of industrial commodities were also
lower, however, declining at an annual rate of 0.9 per cent, in large
part as a result of reduced prices for passenger cars and trucks. This
was the first seasonally-adjusted decline in the industrial commodities
index since mid-1964.

Price changes for industrial materials and finished goods,
by stage of processing, show that prices of crude materials rose, owing
largely to higher prices for iron and steel scrap and wastepaper, which
were permitted to rise under the President's stabilization program
because their prices increased from levels below their legal ceilings
established as of May 25, 1970. Prices of intermediate materials
were unchanged, however. The decline in prices of producer finished

Consumer nonfood finished goods rose from August to September as con-
sumer nondurables increased at an annual rate of 1.1 per cent with

increases for men's suits and coats, miscellaneous rubber products,

goods, tires and tubes, and cotton textile housefurnishings. Consumer
durables declined at an annual rate of 7.3 per cent, however, largely
because of a decrease in prices of automobiles.

THE ECONOMIC PICTURE IN DETAIL
Domestic Financial Situation
Monetary Aggregates, Preliminary data indicate that the
narrow money stock (M1) actually declined during September at about a
3.5 per cent annual rate, lagging behind earlier projections for the
second consecutive month. Combined with the unexpectedly slow growth
rate for August, this brings the rate of increase for the third quarter
as a whole to only 3 per cent, far below the second quarter rate of
over 11 per cent.

With the exception of the first week in September, the weakness
in the money stock persisted throughout the month. The reasons for the
continued sluggishness are not clear, particularly since the huge flow
of private dollar balances abroad, which probably contributed to the
slowing in August, dropped off very sharply during September. Among the
possible explanations are the effects of interest rate increases earlier
in the year on desired cash balances. The evidence on past responses
to interest rate increases suggests, however, that the present slackening
is considerably greater than would have seemed likely. Perhaps what is
occuring is in the nature of a correction from the higher-than-expected
monthly growth rates in the spring and early summer.
The broadly defined money stock (M2) also behaved sluggishly
in September, with preliminary data indicating an annual growth rate of
1 per cent for the month. The decline from the August rate of about 5
per cent was due entirely to the M1 component as time and savings deposits
other than large negotiable CD's expanded at about the same moderate
pace as in August and over the third quarter as a whole.
The adjusted credit proxy grew at a slightly slower rate
during September than in August, but the slowdown was much less pro-
nounced than in the other aggregates and the growth rate for the third
quarter somewhat exceeded that for the second. Large negotiable CD's
outstanding increased sharply in September, more than offsetting the
decline in demand deposits.
The growth in CD's amounted to $2.0 billion on a seasonally
adjusted basis, the largest rise since December 1970, and probably
reflected the widened yield differential between these instruments and

III -3
Treasury bills brought about by increased CD offering rates early in
the month. At the end of the month, the plentiful supply of CD money
prompted some banks, particularly in New York City where inflows were
strongest at that time, to lower their offering rates on such instru-
ments, especially the shorter maturities. Over the month as a whole,
CD growth was relatively strongest at banks outside New York. In addi-
tion to the CD growth, there was a small increase in Euro-dollar
borrowing by U. S. banks, probably arising from a slight increase in
the cost differential in favor of overnight Euro-dollars as compared with
Federal funds.
Bank Credit. End-of-month commercial bank credit expanded at
a seasonally adjusted annual rate of almost 10 per cent during September,
somewhat below the rate for August and about the same as the average for
the third quarter. As in earlier months of the quarter, a rise in total
loans accounted for the largest share of this increase. Banks did ac-
quire sizeable amounts of municipal securities (primarily short-term)
and some Federal agency debt as well during the month, following a
small drop in holdings of such issues during August, but these latter
increases were offset to a considerable degree by a continued decline,
for the third consecutive month, in holdings of U. S. Government ob-
ligations.
Business loan growth dropped off during September from the
extremely rapid pace of August. This drop lends further credence to
the view that a large part of the August bulge in business loans stemmed
from foreign exchange developments during the period. Moreover, there
is some evidence--by no means firm--that suggests that the moderate

increase in business loans during September includes some borrowing
attributable to foreign exchange considerations. Even after taking
account of these factors, however, it would still appear that domestic
business loan demand during the third quarter as a whole probably
picked up at least slightly over the second quarter.
With business loans showing modest growth in September, the
remainder of the rise in total loans was spread over a number of loan
categories. Real estate loans continued to expand rapidly for the

III -5
fourth month in succession, reflecting the high level of activity in
both new and existing properties. Loans against securities showed an
increase of over $1 billion after seasonal adjustment for the second
month in a row, as dealers in municipal and corporate securities ex-
panded their inventories. Finally, consumer loans, which were revised
sharply upward for August, apparently showed another very large increase
in September, probably reflecting in part the upsurge in new car sales.
It also has been suggested, however, that customer financing of auto-
mobile purchases may be shifting from finance companies to banks due
both to lower rates and to the willingness of at least some banks to
extend the maturity of auto loans to 42 months. This observation also
is consistent with the seasonally adjusted decline during September in
bank loans to nonbank financial institutions; however, this decline
probably resulted primarily from a shift by nonbank finance companies
from bank loans to less expensive short-term borrowing in the open
market.
Nonbank depositary institutions. Deposit outflows from
nonbank thrift institutions during the grace day portion of the September-
October dividend reinvestment period were unusually small, a reflection
no doubt of the generally lower yields available from alternative uses
of funds such as short-term market securities.
During the whole month of September, deposit inflows to non-
bank thrift institutions were sustained at about the pace of July and
August combined. During the third quarter as a whole, deposit growth
moderated further from the very high rate of the first quarter this

III -6
year; by any other standard, however, nonbank institutions' deposit
growth has remained strong, especially at savings and loan associations.

Mutual savings banks in July and August, for the first time
this year, acquired a substantially larger volume of mortgages than of
corporate securities. This shift in favor of mortgages probably reflects
the lag in takedowns from the expanded mortgage commitment activity
that accompanied large savings inflows earlier in the year. While await-
ing delivery of completed mortgages, corporate bonds were, of course,
readily available as an outlet for funds in addition to those allocations
that would have been made anyway on the basis of yield considerations.

Savings and loan associations in August made a moderate further
downward adjustment in their still-ample liquid asset position. While
cash flows from mortgage repayments, including refinancing, remained
very large during August, S&Ls augmented them somewhat by borrowing about
$150 million from the FHLB in September, about the same as they had in
August.
Mortgage market. As of early October, yields on Government
underwritten home mortgages were continuing to edge down in the secondary
market, judging from FNMA's auction results. Average yields on 3-month
forward purchase commitments in the October 4 auction were 1 basis point
below their level two weeks earlier, and 22 basis points below the

III -8
year's high posted several weeks before the President's mid-August
speech. (September data for rates on conventional home mortgages in
the more sluggish primary market may be available in time for the
Greenbook Supplement; during August, such rates showed little change.)

Beginning July 26 auction are only for 3-month commitments;
during the third quartet, not seasonally adjusted flows of
credit to the mortgage market continued to expand for the sixth conse-
cutive quarter, but less sharply than in the spring. Net increases for
each major type-of-property component--except farm--reached record
highs, judging from tentative estimates. On residential mortgages, net
growth in outstanding credit attained a seasonally adjusted annual rate
of as much as $42 billion, far above the $20 billion low posted early

III -9
last year. Federal credit agencies, which accelerated their net acqui-
sitions considerably, and savings and loan associations together appar-
ently accounted for about three-fourths of the total residential debt
expansion. The more diversified commercial banks and mutual savings
banks also appear to have stepped up their net takings. Life insurance
companies, in contrast disinvested in this sector for the third con-
secutive quarter, as they placed fewer funds in new residential mort-
gages than were repaid on their $42 billion portfolio.
Given the exceptionally strong momentum in mortgage lending
activity and the development of concern about savings flow prospects,
nonbank thrift institutions apparently became more cautious about their
commitment policies in July and August. For New York State savings
banks and all savings and loan associations, the combined seasonally
adjusted volume of mortgage commitments outstanding changed little in
August, at a level more than twice the low reached in early 1970.

Consumer credit. Consumer instalment credit outstanding in-
creased at a $9.9 billion seasonally adjusted annual rate in August,
continuing the step-ups in the rate of credit growth that have occurred
since last year's fourth quarter when outstandings actually declined.
Instalment credit expanded at an annual rate of $2.7 billion in the
first quarter of 1971, $6.7 billion in the second quarter, and a near-
record $9.5 billion in the first 2 months of the third quarter. The
marked gains in new car deliveries and the improved rate of chain store
sales during September suggest another month of substantial credit use.

increases boosted total extensions and repayments above their earlier
peaks reached in late spring. Automobile credit was extended at a $36
billion annual rate in August, up more than 9 per cent from the $33
billion rate in the first half of 1971, and more than 35 per cent above
the strike-affected fourth quarter of 1970; the August increase occurred
mainly at commercial banks. While the number of new and used cars financed
has risen about in line with unit sales, there has been a substantial in-
crease in the size of the average contract. During the July-August period
seasonally adjusted new car contracts averaged more than $3,350 compared
with less than $3,100 in the fourth quarter of 1970; used car contracts
have risen to $1,850 from about $1,700.
The trend of extensions for nonautomotive consumer goods and
services continues to be dominated by the major growth sectors--mobile
homes and bank credit cards. As of mid-1971, mobile home financing
constituted almost one-half of the nonautomotive consumer goods credit
outstanding at commercial banks. (Beginning next month the Consumer

III -12
Credit Section will begin regular publication of monthly estimates of
bank lending in the mobile home sector.)
Corporate and municipal securities markets. After a period
of rising long-term interest rates in the latter half of September,
when the market absorbed a heavy volume of bonds, yields on both cor-
porate and municipal bonds began to fall again. By October 8 the new
issue Aaa corporate index was only 10 basis points above the level pre-
vailing at the time of the last Committee meeting, and the improvement
in secondary market yields was even more marked. Tax-exempt bond
yields were close to their 1971 low.
In the last four weeks, NYSE, AMEX and NASDAQ price indices
have shown little fluctuation with relatively low trading volume in
each of their respective markets. Up to October 11, stock prices have
exhibited no definite pattern in their reaction to announcements con-
cerning the post-freeze program.
Public offerings of corporate bonds amounted to $2 billion in
September, somewhat below previous estimates because of postponements
as rates rose late in the month. On the basis of present schedulings,
the staff expects the October and November calendars to average about
$1.75 billion, appreciably below the average volume for the first
three-quarters of the year. Underwriters report that, on the whole,
prospective bond issuers are not in immediate need of funds, since the
borrowers who were pressed had already issued bonds or stock earlier
this year. In addition, general uncertainty about the effects on bond
markets of the Administration's program to cope with inflation and

II -13
about the strength of the economic recovery seems to be a factor in the
tapering of the forward calendar.

New equity offerings remain at a high level, despite recent
sluggishness in the stock market. The sharp fluctuation in projected
volume from October to November reflects the timing pattern of utility
offerings. Stock issues by power companies accounted for about 38 per
cent of total stock volume during the first half of 1971, and irregu-
larities in issue patterns by the investor-owned utilities have an

III -14
important impact on the total volume in any given month. Takedowns of
private placements are apparently also continuing at a high level.
However, the expected drop in public bond offerings from the first-half
levels suggests a significant decline in total corporate securities
offerings during the fourth quarter.

quisitions of State and local bonds have picked up again in the last
few weeks, and some casualty companies have also increased their pur-

Government securities market. Yields on Treasury notes and
bonds, as well as Treasury bill rates, have declined on balance since
the last meeting of the Committee. Over the three weeks ending October
8, yield reductions in the coupon sector ranged from 10 to about 30
basis points, while bill rates moved 25 to 50 basis points lower. The
key 3-month bill was recently bid at about 4.50 per cent, compared with
4.78 per cent on September 21. The market reacted mildly to the
announcement of Phase II as many participants continued to adopt a
wait-and-see attitude with regard to the specific details of the plan.

Aside from the general improvement in all markets resulting
from growing hopes as to the strength of the President's post-freeze
program of wage-price restraint, the firmness in the Treasury market
over the last few weeks also reflected factors more directly connected
with monetary policy: namely, the expectations effects arising out of
the continued slowing in growth of the money aggregates and the emer-
gence of somewhat easier money market conditions. The last of these,
through the resultant reduction in day-to-day dealer financing costs,
was especially important for the bill market where recurrent rumors
of an increase in supplies through a tax bill financing and a drop-
off in foreign official demand for bills might have otherwise tended
to hold rates up. In the coupon sector, the decline in yields was
also derived in part from the encouraging reception accorded the large
weekly offerings of corporate and tax-exempt issues. The Treasury's
announcement of an auction on October 15 of $2.0 billion 5-7/8 per cent,
3-1/4-year note was well received by the market and caused little
change in prices.
Dealer positions in Treasury issues have also reflected the
general improvement in the market. Positions in Treasury bills have
changed relatively little, fluctuating around $2.25 billion, indicating
fairly easy sales of dealers' weekly bill awards at the declining yields
and no particular pressure from the dealers at current financing costs
to pare down the general level of their bill holdings. Coupon positions

III -18
have tended to rise slightly recently on continued expectations of
falling interest rates and as the market has begun focusing on the
forthcoming November refunding and the possibility that an advance
refunding may be included in the financing.

Shortly after the last Committee meeting, it was announced
that the System would be undertaking outright operations in Federal
agency securities as part of regular open market operations. Prices
of agency issues immediately adjusted higher but then retreated
quickly to the levels prevailing prior to the announcement. Actual
Desk purchases of agency issues took place on two days: on September 23,
$61 million were purchased in maturities of less than two years and
on September 30, $35 million were purchased of which $26 million were
in over-5-year maturities. These operations have had hardly any effect
on prices in the agency market; and in fact spreads over comparable
maturities of direct Treasury have widened slightly over the entire
period from late September.
There were three new issues in the agency market in late
September and early October. All were accorded good receptions and
subsequently traded at premiums. The details of the issues are
summarized in the following table.

Other short-term credit markets. Preliminary estimates for
September show seasonally adjusted commercial and finance paper out-
standing at $30.6 billion, an increase of $1.2 billion for the month.
Directly-placed finance company paper rose $1.0 billion seasonally
adjusted, accounting for the greater part of this expansion. (So
large a rise is probably due to the inappropriateness of the usual sea-
sonal factor in the face of the earlier model changeover in automobiles.)
Over the third quarter, directly-placed paper rose only about
$200 million a month, on average. The moderate quarterly increase in
finance paper outstanding at a time when car sales were rising apparently
reflects the continuing shift of retail auto loans into commercial banks.
In the week ending October 6, most private short-term interest
rates moved down from the plateau on which they have been since early
September, after having declined following the announcement of wage-
price controls on August 15. Most of the recent declines were small,
but they ranged in the longer maturities up to 37 basis points.

Federal finance. The tax bill recently passed in the House
would reduce total Federal revenues by about $8 billion in calendar
1972, approximately $1/2 billion less than the amount proposed in the
President's new economic program. However, the House bill provides
a smaller tax reduction for corporations and a larger reduction for
individuals, as can be seen by comparing columns (2) and (3) of
Table I. While the Senate has not yet acted on the tax bill, it is
also expected to be more receptive to reductions in individual
taxes. In view of this Congressional sentiment, the staff projec-
tions now incorporate the House-passed amendments to the Administration
tax proposals.

The House initiated an increase retroactive to January 1971
in the personal exemption, from $650 to $675, together with a retro-
active increase in low income allowances. While these measures reduce
1971 liabilities by $1.4 billion, only a fraction of this will be
reflected in lower withholding during 1971. This lower withholding
is slated to start in mid-November, but will probably be further
delayed by the Senate. Hence, to provide for the retroactive reduction
in liabilities prior to mid-November, Table 1 allows for a one-time
increase in refunds (of about $1.0 billion) that will affect the
budget largely in the Spring of 1972.
In addition to passing the Administration's proposals to
advance to January 1972 the increase in the personal exemption and
general standard deduction previously legislated to start in 1973, the
House adopted a low income allowance--raising the minimum standard
deduction to $1,300.
Turning to corporate tax liabilities, the House approved a
straight 7 per cent investment tax credit, which reduces calendar
1972 corporate liabilities by $2.9 billion. The Administration had
recommended a 10 per cent investment tax credit (later declining to
5 per cent) that would reduce 1972 liabilities by about $3.8 billion.
In addition, the House bill would increase corporate tax liabilities
by about $1.4 billion in calendar 1972 by modifying the accelerated
depreciation rules recently adopted by the Administration. Thus, on

III- 25
net, the House-bill would reduce calendar 1972 corporate tax liabilities
by about $1.5 billion, compared to the $3.8 billion reduction pro-
posed in the new economic program. The House bill also provides a
larger reduction in indirect business taxes because the elimination
of the auto excise tax is extended to small trucks.
As previously assumed in the staff projection, Congress has
now upheld the six-month postponement of the Federal pay raise
recommended by the President. While Congress has not acted on most
of the other expenditure cuts included in the new program, mere
failure to act can have the recommended effect because, to a large
extent, the proposed cuts are to be achieved by postponing new programs,
especially revenue sharing and welfare reform. There has been little
change in the staff estimate of Federal expenditures since the mid-
September Greenbook. The estimate of fiscal year outlays for national
defense has been raised by about $.3 billion because the staff now
assumes that the military pay raise will become effective in mid-
November, at the end of the freeze period, rather than in January.
These recent developments have not greatly changed the
near-term budget outlook. Although the House tax bill affects the
composition of receipts, the staff estimate of total receipts, on a
unified budget basis, for fiscal 1972 has not been changed since the
last Greenbook and the projected deficit remains $27.5 billion. On
a NIA basis, the projected deficit in the first half of calendar 1972

III -26
has declined slightly, with the decrease in personal tax receipts
attributable to the House tax bill offset by increased corporate
taxes and the effect of increased income assumptions. The high
employment budget projections also show a large shift toward fiscal
stimulus in the first half of 1972 than shown in the last Greenbook.
However, this does not include any allowance for the House action in
changing the composition of projected receipts, which may have some
additional stimulative effects in the short-run because of the greater
emphasis on personal income tax cuts.
With the Treasury cash balance higher than projected at the
end of September, net cash borrowing in the fourth quarter is now
projected to be smaller, amounting to slightly more than $7 billion.
While this is less than the exceptionally large $9 billion borrowed in
the same period of the previous year, as much as a third of that year's
borrowing was financed by foreign purchases of Treasury securities.
The Treasury has announced that it will borrow $2.0 billion in mid-
October by auctioning a note that matures in February 1975. In
addition, staff projections assume that the Treasury will resume $.2
billion additions to the regular weekly bill auction and that out-
standing Euro-dollar certificates will be retired as they mature.
There are market expectations of a possible advance refunding as well
as additional cash borrowing at the time of the November quarterly
refinancing.

THE ECONOMIC PICTURE IN DETAIL
International Developments
Foreign exchange markets. Major foreign currencies firmed
sharply ahead of the annual IMF meetings in late September, the rise
being fueled by press reports of specific revaluation percentages
(well above market rates at the time) purportedly being suggested by
the IMF. Since that run-up, most currencies have shown little further
change, with the exception of the Japanese yen which has continued to
appreciate. Appreciations and depreciations -- as of September 15 and 30
and October 12 -- of major currencies from their pars, both against the
dollar and against a weighted average of all currencies, are shown
in the table below.

Note: Calculations are based on offer rates in the New York market on
September 15 and 30 and October 12, 1971 and par values in effect on
May 1, 1970. For weighted average appreciations (column 4), weights
are shares of each country in 1970 world trade. Shares are calculated
as the sum of each country's exports and imports (f.o.b.) divided by
two times world exports. Currencies other than the ten are assumed, as
a group, to have neither appreciated nor depreciated against the U.S. dollar.

IV -2
Forward premiums for most of the major foreign currencies
have declined in the past two weeks or so, apparently reflecting a
shift in market expectations about the likely appreciation of spot
rates for these currencies in the near future. Three-month forward
premiums (per cent per annum) for these currencies are shown in Table 2.

Volume in most markets has returned to more or less normal
levels for commercial transactions, but noncommercial business (interest
arbitrage, speculative, and other) remains at a low level.
Demand for sterling, both commercial and speculative, and
possibly interest arbitrage, has been strong since late September, and
the Bank of England has been intervening heavily in the market. It
may have purchased as much as $500 million so far in October, (Britain's
published reserves for September showed an increase of just over $200
million). On October 6, the Bank of England extended the list of
British money market instruments ineligible for purchase by non-residents.
There are some indications that the Bank of Japan may have
been intervening less heavily in October than in September, but we are

IV -3
unable to confirm this at present. Japan's published reserves in-
creased by around $800 million in September.
The German Federal Bank has purchased $0.7 billion forward
and about $180 million spot since September 21. Prior to that it had
not been intervening to limit the appreciation of the DM.
The Bank of France has sold some $0.5 billion since September
15, as the French franc eased well away from its upper limit. Com-
pliance by French exporters and importers with exchange control regula-
tions (instituted in August) has apparently led to some reversal of
leads and lags, and the Bank of France indicated that it is now seeing
some unwinding of speculative forward positions in francs taken up in
July.
In system operations, the FRBNY purchased $37 million equiva-
lent of Belgian francs in the New York market, and utilized these
balances to repay a $35 million equivalent swap drawing on the Belgian
National Bank, incurring a $1.9 million loss on that drawing. Outstand-
ing Belgian franc drawings now total $600 million equivalent (at the
exchange rate in effect when the drawing was made). The System's
purchases of francs -- which were undertaken at the request of the
National Bank of Belgium -- apparently were the chief cause of an
appreciation of the franc by about 3/4 per cent in the week ended
October 8.

ness to acquire dollar claims, and a weakening in demand for dollar
loans for conversion into foreign currencies, as the market assigned
a lower probability to large exchange rate changes following the IMF
meetings at the end of September. Forward exchange rates for most

IV -5
major foreign currencies eased in October; coupled with easier money
market conditions in some European centers, this may have led to
some arbitrage into Euro-dollars, contributing to the fall in rates.
Wire service reports have alleged that the primary source
of funds to the market has been the Bank for International Settlements,
and have surmised that central banks are supplying the market through
the BIS. However, the Bank of Japan and the Bank of France have denied
that they have supplied the market, and we are not aware that any G-10
country has determined to break the earlier agreement against making
Euro-dollar placements. Other central banks could be supplying the
market, but we cannot verify this.
Overnight Euro-dollars have remained competitive with over-
night funds available in the Federal funds market, and U.S. banks
increased their liabilities to branches by $575 million from September 15
through October 6, more than offsetting a run-off of $500 million of
special Euro-dollar issues on September 28. The Treasury allowed an
additional $500 million of such issues to run-off on October 12,
bringing the amount outstanding to $1/2 billion. The final $1/2
billion issue will mature on October 26.
On September 22 the National Bank of Belgium announced a
cut in their discount rate by 1/2 per cent to 5-1/2 per cent and on
September 14 the Netherlands Bank cut its discount rate by 1/2 per
cent to 5 per cent. The Bundesbank announced a cut in its discount
rate from 5 to 4-1/2 per cent on October 13.

U.S. balance of payments. There are very few clues in the
data that have become available since August 15 to the underlying
condition of the U.S. balance of payments. As noted in the following
section, the merchandise trade deficit in the April-August period was
exaggerated by temporary influences -- though even with allowance for
such elements the trade deficit was substantial -- and since then the
opening of West Coast ports and the closing of East Coast and some
Gulf ports have compounded the confusion. Added to this are the
uncertain effects of exchange rate changes and the import surcharge --
which should, of course, be tending to reduce the trade deficit during
the fourth quarter.
In August the official settlements over-all deficit (not
seasonally adjusted) was some $8.8 billion, compared to $2.5 billion
in July. Of the factors known at this time, the trade deficit was
about the same in each of the months, and transactions in foreign and
U.S. securities were not significantly different. Lending reported
by banks in the United States was far larger in August than the month
before, reaching a net outflow of $1,650 million (not seasonally
adjusted) compared to a small net inflow in July. Of the August
outflow, about $450 million was accounted for by U.S. branches and
agencies of foreign banks, $1.2 billion was by U.S. banks and
chargeable to VFCR ceilings, and $50 million was outflows for customer
accounts or of types not covered by the VFCR.

IV -7
In September, there was still a large official settlements
deficit -- perhaps $1-1/2 billion. Most of this accrued to a few
countries whose central banks were buying dollars to prevent their
exchange rates from rising faster. In a few cases -- notably Germany --
the central bank also operated in the forward market, buying dollars
forward to lessen the spot inflow. In most countries measures were
in operation to either force capital inflows into a separate market or
to make such inflows difficult by restricting the assets that could be
purchased or eliminating interest payments on foreign deposits. Some
countries in easing monetary policy have intended to minimize capital
inflows as well as to stimulate domestic activity.
There is scarcely any evidence yet that the market is convinced
that any of the major currencies involved has reached its maximum likely
appreciation against the dollar, though lower Euro-dollar rates suggest
some easing of speculative demand. Positions are not likely to be unwound
on a large scale until new parities are established, or until the pattern
of "floating" rates looks more settled. However, once the market believes
that only minor further upward movements can be expected, there could
be a rush to shift back into dollars, or to repay high-cost Euro-dollar
debt incurred in establishing speculative positions.
Apart from the prospect of a reflow of speculative funds, the
near-term outlook for the U.S. balance of payments is not promising.
Any tendency for economic conditions in other industrial countries to
slacken further would have a greater adverse effect on the trade balance

IV -8
than any immediate results of the exchange rate changes that might
occur. Certainly, the rate changes that have occurred since May
are not likely to be very significant, since they amount to a dollar
devaluation of only 3-4 per cent against all other currencies,
though the import surcharge could have a substantial effect if it
is operating into next year. Very important over the longer run will
be the degree of success of the program to restrain wage and price
increased in the United States.
Uncertainties about the exchange rates that might finally
be established abroad may cause some delay in corporate capital flows
as investors reassess their plans for the location of additional
capacity abroad. However, the latest Commerce survey shows that
expansion of investment abroad is still high on the agenda of U.S.
industry. Over-all projections for foreign plant and equipment
expenditures are for a rise of 12 per cent in 1971, followed by a
further increase of 10 per cent in 1972. For Western Europe, these
percentages are 9 and 14, respectively. It would probably take very
large revaluations abroad to slow this trend; in the case of Japan,
any relaxation of restrictions on inflows would probably result in
a major inflow from the United States even if the rate for the yen
were to rise sharply.
U.S. foreign trade. The U.S. trade balance in August showed
another large deficit, for the fifth consecutive month. For the two
months July-August the deficit was at an annual rate of $4.1 billion

IV -9
(balance of payments basis), about equal to the very high deficit
rate of the second quarter, as both exports and imports fell by about
the same amount. For the first 8 months of this year the trade balance
was a deficit of $2-1/2 billion at an annual rate. In the corresponding
period of 1970, the balance was a $2-3/4 billion surplus.
Trade movements this year have been beset by special or
temporary factors making it difficult to determine our basic trade
position. A rough adjustment for such factors indicates that our
trade balance in July-August would still have been in deficit but
at a rate of between $2-1/2 and $3 billion -- about two-thirds or
three-fourths of the actual rate.
Ordinarily the West Coast dock strike (which began in early
July) might have been expected to affect imports more than exports, but
a considerable amount of inbound cargo, particularly cars from Japan,
was apparently diverted to other ports so that it is estimated that
the effect of the strike on the trade balance was not very great.
(In early October the West Coast strike was ended for at least 80
days by a Taft-Hartley injunction).
In the third quarter there was a greater acceleration in
imports than in exports through East and Gulf Coast ports, to beat
a dock strike at these ports on October 1, which did begin on that
date. Thus, on balance, port strike developments tended to worsen
the trade account through September. In the fourth quarter, with

IV -10
East Coast ports closed, both imports and exports may be sharply
reduced -- imports probably more than exports. The import surcharge
and the still relatively small exchange rate changes may also begin
to damp down imports in the current quarter.
However, other factors which have been adversely affecting
our trade balance are still present. These include: (1) a less
favorable cyclical position than was present last year, resulting in
an easing of supply conditions in Europe and Japan; and (2) the market
penetration by foreign products in the past six years when domestic
costs and prices were rising steeply. Exports in the first eight
months of this year were only 3 per cent greater in value than exports
in the corresponding period of 1970, even after rough adjustment for the
effects of U.S. strikes. The entire gain in exports this year has been
in agricultural commodities and commercial aircraft (in the early part of
the year) and through higher deliveries of automotive equipment to Canada.
Exports of machinery have slowed and there has been a sharp decline
in non-agricultural industrial materials -- particularly copper and
aluminum -- reflecting the slowdown in foreign economic activity
(see p. IV-13). There has been a further slippage in the U.S. share of
world exports of manufactured goods to about 17-1/2 per cent, about
1 percentage point below our share in the second quarter of last year.
In contrast, imports in the first 8 months of this year (also
adjusted for strike effects) were about 12 per cent greater than in
the like period of 1970. Nearly 40 per cent of the increase was in

IV -11
cars. The increasing popularity of compact and sub-compact cars --
which dominate the types produced in Canada -- account for the up-
surge in car imports from that source. In 1970, sales of European and
Japanese cars totaled about 1.3 million units, about 15 per cent of
total car sales in the United States. In August of this year sales
were up to an annual rate of more than 1.85 million units, equivalent
to over 18 per cent of an enlarged domestic car market. Sales of
Japanese cars have nearly doubled in the first 9 months of this year
compared to the corresponding period of 1970. Imports of foreign
cars were also boosted by the additional inventories needed to support
the expansion in sales.
Imports of several categories of industrial materials,
not affected by domestic strikes,also increased this year. The heavy
inflow of crude petroleum which began in May reflects the decline in
tanker rates, increased quotas and higher prices resulting from the
new tax arrangements made by U.S. oil companies with foreign countries
last spring. Imports of lumber this year have continued the uptrend
that begin in mid-1970 as domestic housing starts boomed. Imports of
chemicals, which were relatively flat throughout 1970, have also
been increasingly large in each quarter of this year.
As a result of the slow rate of expansion in exports and the
continuing growth in imports, our trade balance with most major areas,
particularly Western Europe and Japan, has deteriorated this year.

IV -12
In the first half of this year our trade deficit with Japan was at an
annual rate of $3 billion compared with a $1-1/4 billion deficit in all
of 1970. (This rate of deficit was reduced in July-August as imports
from Japan fell more than exports as a result of the West Coast strike.)
Our traditional trade surplus with Western Europe ($2.9 billion in 1970)
virtually disappeared in the second quarter of this year and then
turned into a deficit in July-August as exports to these countries
leveled off while imports picked up sharply.

IV -13
Cyclical developments in major industrial countries. In many
European countries economic expansion has slowed down significantly in
recent months. In contrast to the temporary flattening of economic
activity around mid-1970, which resulted from inventory adjustments
and supply constraints, the current slowing of activity reflects
weaker demand conditions for plant and equipment. In Japan, growth
has remained very slow throughout the period since mid-1970. In
Canada, there appears to have been some recovery from the 1970 recession
during the first half of 1971.
Almost everywhere the mainsprings of such growth as did
occur this spring and summer were consumer spending and exports.
Japanese and Canadian exports rose very rapidly,while in Britain they
were the one strong sector; in France, exports were also an important
factor in economic expansion.
The de facto exchange rate changes that have occurred so
far and the temporary U.S. measures, if these should persist for
some time, will affect activity most in Japan, Germany and Canada,
but there will also be a significant, albeit smaller, impact on Belgium,
the Netherlands and Sweden. The United Kingdom will probably be
affected relatively little. In France and Italy, where the impact of
the U.S. measures is slight, the exchange rate changes of other countries
even benefit the trade balance and stimulate the domestic economy.
The same is true on balance for British and Canadian exports. Final
exchange rate realignment and the removal of the U.S. import surcharge

IV -14
obviously will alter the pattern of effects among countries, but are
not likely to change the above assessment by much.
The outlook for the remainder of this year and for early
1972 is for accelerating activity in the United Kingdom -- where the
Government took expansionary actions in July -- and continued very
slow growth in Germany and Japan. Activity in Canada will tend to
run parallel with that of the U.S. economy. In the other industrial
countries of Europe there is, on the average, likely to be moderate
expansion with considerable variations from country to country.
The above assessments can be substantially altered by changes
in or reversals of the present policy stances. Stimulative policies
are now being pursued in Britain, Japan and Canada. Germany is still
putting emphasis on controlling inflationary tendencies, but has a
large countercyclical contingency budget and the discount rate was
reduced on October 13. Maintenance of a high level of activity in
Germany would help to sustain growth elsewhere in Europe.
In general, neither present cyclical indicators nor expected
policy stances point to a serious and pervasive recession in Europe.
On the other hand, a period of very slow growth in Germany and some
other countries is now indicated and this tendency may be reinforced
by the prospective adjustments in trade balances.
In Germany, the moderation in pace of activity which had
been apparent during most of 1970 and which reflected inventory
adjustments and supply difficulties, was interrupted around the turn
of the year. Since the spring, the slower growth has become more

IV -15
clearly defined and results from a weakening of demand for investment
goods. Real GNP, after a relatively large rise in the first quarter
of the year, probably was flat in the second quarter. Taking the
two quarters together, the underlying growth trend moderated from
about a 4 per cent annual rate during 1970 to about a 2-1/2 per cent
annual rate. Industrial production eased off a little from April
through August mainly because of some decline in the output of
machinery, reflecting slackening demand. Both domestic and export
new orders have stabilized this year and may have begun to turn down
during the summer. In real terms, both new orders and deliveries in
German manufacturing have declined. But demand for housing construction
and consumer goods, and also government demand for goods and services,
are continuing to rise.
With the slower economic pace, overtime is being curtailed
and hourly earnings in industry are rising much less rapidly than they
did in 1970. In addition, newly concluded labor contracts show more
moderate increases than in the past. Consequently, the rise in unit
labor costs has moderated. However, the rise in industrial wholesale
prices has moderated only slightly if at all; between March-April and
July-August they rose at an annual rate of 4 per cent. Thus, profit
margins are no longer under pressure from labor costs. Consumer
prices have continued to rise at a 5 per cent annual rate.
The foreign trade balance through August has not shown a
clear reaction to the diminution of demand pressures and the apprecia-

IV -16
tion of the German mark since May. Since March, the trade balance has
increased not only in dollars, but also in German marks. Exports
regained their high winter level and imports stabilized. As import
unit values have fallen, the volume of imports has continued to
rise, especially imports of industrial materials and semi-finished
goods, which reflects the fact that the German economy still operates
at a high level of activity.
The German government continues to place its main policy
emphasis on controlling the remaining inflationary tendencies. Market
factors -- including the absence of reserve accruals by the Bundesbank -
had been tightening monetary conditions, and on October 13 the Bundes-
bank moved to at least offset these tendencies. The discount rate
was cut by 1/2 of a percentage point to 4-1/2 per cent, the Lombard
rate by a full percentage point to 5-1/2 per cent and reserve require-
ments were also reduced. The government has proposed a "stability-
minded" budget for 1972 with expenditures rising by about the same
amount as nominal GNP -- around 8.4 per cent. But there may be more
give in the budget than the published figures imply. In addition,
the "contingency" budget to be used in the event of an undesirable
weakening in economic activity is very large.
In the United Kingdom, real GNP in the first half of 1971
was 1 per cent below the level in the second half of 1970. But the
reflationary impact of the April budget, bolstered by a further
package of expansionary measures in July, should insure that GNP

IV -17
increases at an annual rate of about 4 to 4-1/2 per cent (in real
terms) at least through mid-1972. However, even at this relatively
high rate of growth, unemployment -- which in September reached a
total of almost 900,000, exceedingly high by British standards --
is unlikely to decline significantly during the next year.
During the first quarter this year, GNP declined sharply,
largely due to strikes. Total output then rose in the second quarter
but not enough to reach the level in the fourth quarter last year.
The weakest component of GNP in the first half was fixed capital
investment, which declined by about 2 per cent in real terms from the
second half of 1970. There was a particularly steep decrease of
about 7 per cent in investment in manufacturing. Real personal con-
sumption expenditures were virtually unchanged between the two periods.
The only major GNP category to show strength during the first half
was exports of goods and services, which increased by about 2.7 per
cent in real terms.
The government sought to stimulate the economy early last
spring when, in the budget which began April 1, it announced cuts in
both business and personal taxation and increases in social insurance
payments. However, the disappointingly small increase in output in
the second quarter prompted the government to take additional expan-
sionary action in July. The principal measures included substantial
reductions in indirect taxes and the removal of restrictions on
installment buying. In addition, regulations governing depreciation

IV -18
allowances were liberalized and expenditures on public works projects
in areas of high unemployment were raised.
The July measures were aimed primarily at stimulating
personal consumption expenditures,which are expected to rise by
about 6 per cent, in real terms, from first half 1971 to first half
1972. A substantial rise in the volume of retail sales -- which account
for about half of total personal consumption expenditures -- in both
July and August suggest that the July measures have had an immediate
stimulative impact.
The recovery should also be aided by exports of goods and
services, projected to grow by about 4 per cent, in real terms, in
the same period, despite the post-August 15 developments. Private
nonresidential investment will remain the weakest element in the
economy; surveys of businessmen's intentions indicate a decline
continuing through 1972. However, if Parliament on October 28 votes
its approval -- as expected -- of Britain's entry into the EEC, invest-
ment plans may be revised upward. Rapid recovery in consumer spending
should have the same effect.
The government's stepped up efforts to stimulate economic
growth have apparently been accompanied by a change in its attitude
toward prices and incomes policy, which before July had been limited
almost solely to encouraging resistance by employers to wage demands
considered excessive, even at the expense of long and costly strikes.
In July, however, the government endorsed the Confederation of British

IV -19
Industry's campaign to win the agreement of British business to
halt price increases, or restrict them to 5 per cent where "unavoidable,"
in the year ending July 31. The CBI's program has apparently gained
a wide measure of support from business and, if accompanied by coopera-
tion from labor unions in the form of more moderate wage demands, could
make a significant contribution to easing Britain's still severe price
and wage inflation.
The French government projects 1971 real GNP to be 6 per cent
above 1970, about the same increase as from 1969 to 1970. But unemploy-
ment rose sharply in the latter half of 1970 and has not fallen
significantly this year. Consumer prices have been rising steadily
at a rate of about 6 per cent. In contrast to 1970, when investment
led the expansion, consumption has been the mainspring of growth in
1971. Exports have continued to grow rapidly.
The policy stance in France has been slightly on the expan-
sionary side this year. Fiscal policy was more or less neutral, but
monetary policy was expansionary despite the announced tightening last
May when the Bank of France's discount rate was raised by a quarter
point to underscore official concern about inflation. In the first
7 months of this year, money supply (M2), seasonally adjusted, grew
at a 16 per cent annual rate, a sharp rise from the 10 per cent rate
of the same period a year earlier.
The 1972 budget is expected to be in balance and is considered
by the government as neutral in its economic effects. Shifts within

IV -20
the budget, however, emphasize increased public investment spending
and the impact of the budget next year should be slightly stimulative.
Finance Minister Giscard d'Estaing announced during a recent budget
speech that he would not hesitate to reflate the economy next year
should it show signs of flagging. But the reflationary instruments
to be used differ from past practice. The government will resort to
changes in value-added tax rates instead of releasing funds from
special public works accounts, whose spending impact on the economy
is considered to be too slow.
The announcement of the intended 1972 policy stance suggests
that the authorities are opting for a continuation of a high growth
rate -- 5.5 per cent in real terms in 1972 -- and that they are thus
prepared to tolerate a fairly high rate of price increases. This
choice indicates that social peace remains the major concern of the
French government. Unemployment in France is still high and industrial
production in the second quarter was seriously disrupted by strikes.
There are few signs of resistance by employers (including the public
and nationalized sectors) to sizable wage demands, and hourly wage
rates this year have been growing at an annual rate of more than
10 per cent, as was the case in 1970.
In an attempt to slow down inflation and perhaps moderate
wage demands, the Government recently signed an agreement with the
Patronat (Employers' Association). The agreement, similar to the
British one, limits price increases of most goods to 1.5 per cent in

IV -21
the period September 15, 1971, to March 15, 1972; at the retail
level existing profit margins are expected to be maintained.
In Italy, real GNP probably did not increase in the first
half of 1971, when declines in industrial production apparently
offset increases in output in agriculture and services. Industrial
production (excluding construction) fell a further 3-1/2 per cent
in each of the months July and August, but the August drop may be
overstated by a faulty seasonal adjustment.
Production has continued to be plagued by strikes and
absenteeism, but by last spring an insufficiency of aggregate demand
had become the main impediment to expansion. Plant and equipment
spending, which levelled off after mid-1970, has declined this year.
Enterprises' ability to invest was reduced in 1970 when profits were
squeezed, primarily because of very large wage increases but also in
reflection of low output levels. This year, the incentive to invest
has been eroded by the persistently high level of unused plant capacity.
Residential construction has continued to contract, largely in further
reaction to the artificially contrived housing boom in 1968-69. The
growth of private consumption has been very moderate, partly because
job uncertainties have lowered the propensity to consume.
Monetary policy has been expansionary for about a year. In
June, the government increased interest subsidies to stimulate
residential construction, and took steps to speed up investment by
local authorities. In July, a package of fiscal measures was adopted.

IV -22
Social security contributions were reduced for small- and medium-
sized firms and for all firms in the South, and interest subsidies
and investment funds were increased for many sectors. These measures
were expected to have most of their impact in the second half of
1971, when they might add about 1-1/2 per cent to the GNP. However,
incentives for investment when so much idle plant capacity exists
may not prove very stimulating. The government's annual Forecasting
and Programming Report on September 30 avoided any projection of
the national accounts.
In the Netherlands, real GNP is expected to increase by
5 per cent from 1970 to 1971, not much less than from 1969 to 1970.
The economy has continued to be influenced both by excess demand and
cost-push inflation but by the end of summer an easing of the labor
market suggest that demand pressures have begun to abate.
Through mid-1971 private investment remained at very high
levels, but a decline (in real terms) is forecast for next year. High
wage increases have kept consumption demand rising steadily. Govern-
ment expenditures have been more expansionary than intended largely
because of pay increases. Big capital inflows from abroad before
August 15 served to frustrate the nominally tight monetary policy.
With the capital inflows no longer occurring, policy restraint can
now be more effective. And, given the underlying trends, real GNP
is expected to grow in 1972 at less than a full capacity rate of
around 3 per cent. Cost inflation is expected to continue.

IV -23
The Belgian economy, like others, has undergone a slackening
of business activity. Plant and equipment expenditures in industry,
which rose sharply in 1970, have apparently been rising much more
slowly since last winter. Consumer buying has also been markedly
weaker. In the first half of this year, depressed consumer buying
was mainly a reaction to the speeding up of purchases of consumer
goods late last year in anticipation of higher prices resulting from
the introduction of the value-added tax on January 1, 1971. More
recently, consumption has also been affected by the reduced buoyancy
in other sectors. Exports declined early in 1971, and in May-June
were only one per cent above the fourth quarter of 1970, compared
with an 11 per cent gain during last year. Some observers believe
that the decline reflected an acceleration of export shipments late
in 1970 caused by erroneous expectations that tax changes effective
last January 1 would make Belgian exports less competitive.
The Belgian discount rate was reduced by 1/2 of a percentage
point in March and again in September, when ceilings on bank credit
were abolished as well. Fiscal policy has been expansionary this year
in reflection of higher public investment outlays.
In Sweden, a sharp tightening of fiscal and monetary policies
in the autumn of 1970 has resulted in a levelling off in industrial
activity. A price and wage freeze introduced in October 1970 is
still partially in force. Retail prices had been rising at an annual
rate of 7 per cent in the first three quarters of 1970 but were stable
in the first 7 months of 1971.

IV -24
The reduced level of aggregate demand and pessimistic
business expectations affected investment spending this year. Real
GNP in 1971 is likely to average less than 3 per cent above 1970,
compared with the 4.5 per cent growth from 1969 to 1970. Unemployment,
rarely a problem in Sweden, grew significantly in 1971 and the
authorities responded by relaxing monetary restraints and applying
several minor fiscal stimulants. However, the most important
reflationary tool has been the release of funds from the Counter-
cyclical Investment Funds where enterprises deposit part of their
profits in boom years in order to gain tax advantages.
In Japan, industrial activity has moved irregularly in
recent months to a level only slightly higher than a year earlier.
In July-August the index was 3.3 per cent higher than in the same period
in 1970, but moved little from preceding months.
Growth of real GNP has been very slow since mid-1970. From
the third quarter of 1970 to the second quarter of this year, real GNP
rose at an annual rate of only about 2-1/2 per cent. For the fiscal
year which began this April, the government estimated in September that
real GNP will be about 4 to 5 per cent greater than a year earlier.
This implies about a 5 per cent rate of growth on into early 1972
and is a substantially slower rate than the 10 per cent increase
from mid-1969 to mid-1970.
The sluggishness in the economy has resulted mainly from
weak demand for machinery and equipment. New orders for machinery

IV -25
(excluding ships) were down 20 per cent in the second quarter from
the first quarter level. The total level of orders was sustained
by increased demand from the utilities sector.
The U.S. measures of August 15 produced a psychological
shock in Japan. Stock prices declined sharply as did new export
contracts. Consequently, many firms are now sharply reducing their
investment plans. Since Japan's economic growth has been heavily
dependent on investment and a rapid rate of increase in exports, the
growth of real GNP over the next few quarters is likely to continue
to be low.
Late in September the government announced five emergency
measures to assist small- and medium-sized exporters adversely influenced
by the U.S. import surcharge. These measures include special loans
from public financial corporations, special Bank of Japan credit
facilities of up to $300 million to finance export bills, liberalization
of insurance facilities, and special tax concessions.
But the major offsets to the adverse impact of the U.S. import
surcharge and the appreciation of the yen, focus heavily on increased
fiscal stimulus from accelerated expenditures and a reduction in personal
income taxes. The budget has already been boosted twice by supplementary
budgets, and a third supplementary budget is currently being proposed.
The Bank of Japan is pursuing an easy money policy and news-
papers reported in mid-September that a possible fifth reduction in
the Bank's basic discount rate, now 5-1/4 per cent, is being studied.

IV -26
If this cut were made the interest rate paid on time and savings
deposits might also have to be reduced, since the present spread is
very narrow. Such an action would present some legislative problems.
