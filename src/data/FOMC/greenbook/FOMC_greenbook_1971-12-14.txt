SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK
Nonfinancial
Recent evidence tends to support the staff expectation of a
stepped-up pace of expansion in the fourth quarter. Consumer spending
is making a substantial contribution to this expansion, and business
fixed investment expenditures now appear to be somewhat stronger than
previously anticipated. However, the merchandise trade balance has been
in sizable deficit, with port work stoppages having aggravated an already
weak situation. The staff continues to project a rise in real GNP at an
annual rate of close to 6 per cent in the fourth quarter, compared to
about 4 per cent in the third.
Industrial production is estimated to have increased appre-
ciably further in November. A significant development was the apparent
further rise in output of business equipment--the sixth consecutive
monthly increase--to a level around 5 per cent above the May low. New
orders for capital equipment essentially have been on a plateau since
January, but they increased a little in October and total new orders
to producers of durable goods also rose slightly in October.
Retail sales have advanced at a rapid pace since July, and a
further increase is now estimated for November. The most publicized
development has been the strength of demand for new domestic-type autos.
During November, however, unit sales slowed somewhat to a 9.5 million
annual rate, compared with 10.2 million in October, while sales of
imported cars strengthened. Less publicized has been the strength in
retail sales at nondurable goods stores. These sales apparently rose
further in November and were nearly 3 per cent above the third quarter

I- 2
average. Housing starts again exceeded a 2 million annual rate in
October, following a September dip below that level.
The labor market, meanwhile, has remained sluggish. In
November, the unemployment rate moved back up to 6.0 per cent, as the
labor force increased more sharply than employment. The increase in
nonfarm payroll employment was quite moderate during the month, but the
average work week in manufacturing lengthened. The effectiveness of
the wage freeze is evident in the fact that average hourly earnings of
production workers rose at an annual rate of only 1.2 per cent from
August to November; earlier this year the rate of increase had been
nearly 7 per cent.
Recent price developments, too, have been dominated by the
freeze. Average wholesale prices of industrial commodities, seasonally
adjusted, edged up in November, but remained slightly below their August
level. Prices of farm products and foods, partly uncontrolled, were
unchanged on balance from August through November. The rise in consumer
prices, seasonally adjusted, slowed further in October; from August to
October, the CPI rose at an annual rate of only about 2 per cent. In
light of initial Pay Board and Price Commission decisions, a faster pace
of wage and price increases seems in prospect for the immediate post-
freeze period.
Outlook. Current staff projections of GNP for 1972 are
marginally stronger than those presented four weeks ago. The somewhat
larger increases projected for the first quarter in both current dollar
($29.5 billion) and real GNP (an annual rate of 6.8 per cent) reflect
a faster rise in business fixed investment, as suggested by the recent

I-3
Commerce-SEC survey, and a rebound in net exports of goods and services
following the dock-strike affected fourth quarter.
Over the last three quarters of 1972, current dollar GNP is
projected to increase $27-28 billion a quarter, and real GNP is
expected to expand at an annual rate ranging from 6 to 6-1/2 per cent.
Expansive strength is expected to be fairly widespread; one major
exception is residential construction activity which is projected to
edge down in the second half of the year. And apart from pay increases,
Federal purchases of goods and services are projected to change little
over the course of the year.
Consumer spending is expected to rise strongly, reflecting
some tax relief and increased social security benefits effective early
in 1972, and a continued rise in wages and salaries throughout the year.
Business fixed investment is projected to rise about 9-1/2 per cent
from the 1971 level, an increase somewhat larger than in the preceding
projection, reflecting the greater current strength indicated by the
Commerce-SEC survey. With final demands for goods increasing at a
significant pace throughout the year, incentives to build stocks are
likely to strengthen, and inventory investment is projected to rise
fairly steadily.
Although the expansion in real output is projected to be
fairly rapid, output per manhour and the civilian labor force are also
expected to rise appreciably next year. The unemployment rate is thus
projected to decline only gradually, to about 5-1/4 per cent in the
fourth quarter. After the initial round of price increases in Phase II,
price advances are expected to moderate, with the private NP fixed weight

I-4
price index projected to slow to an annual rate of 2.8 per cent late
in the year.
Financial
Corporate and U.S. Government security yields, after rising
10 to 20 basis points in late November, have returned to levels similar
to those at the time of the last FOMC meeting. Recent declines in
yields have been smaller, however, the tax exempt market, where yields,
after rising by 25 basis points, remain considerably above earlier
levels. Downward yield adjustments in early December occurred against
a backdrop of lightened dealer inventories, a reduction in the Federal
funds rate, an increase in foreign demand for bills, and large purchases
of Treasury coupon issues by Federal Reserve and foreign official ac-
counts. Declines also reflected the abatement of investor uncertainty
regarding domestic and international developments.
In the market for Government securities, the late November
yield increases in part reflected the size and composition of Treasury
financing operations. Thus, even though most other short-term yields
were unchanged or lower, bill yields rose in some cases over 20 basis
points in late November--despite continued sizeable foreign purchases--
as an expansion in the regular weekly and monthly bill offerings was
joined by a $2.5 billion issue of special tax bills just before the
Thanksgiving holiday. In the longer-term Treasury market, the supply
of coupon issues had been increased significantly by the November
refunding which expanded the public holdings of longer-term Treasury
issues by almost $6 billion. A large portion of the increased supply

I-5
was taken by dealers, whose over-all coupon positions rose to an ex-
tremely high level. Subsequently, dealer inventories were reduced by
about a third, reflecting for the most part Federal Reserve purchases
totalling about $850 million since mid-November.
At banks, business loans declined in November, while con-
sumer and real estate loans continued to rise rapidly. Reflecting
mainly weak business loan demands, banks have remained unaggressive
bidders for CD's. However, with rate relationships favorable, inflows
of consumer-type time and savings deposits remained large by historical
standards at both commercial banks and nonbank thrift institutions.
Outlook. Assuming continuation of the recently easier money
market conditions, upward pressures on interest rates generally are
unlikely to develop over coming weeks, and in some markets further
interest rate declines seem in prospect. The outlook especially in
short-term markets, is made uncertain, however, by the state of
current international exchange rate negotiations. If these negotia-
tions are prolonged, and market participants continue to expect further
appreciation of foreign inventories, private capital outflows are
likely to continue, sustaining foreign official demand for dollar
assets, particularly Treasury bills. On the other hand,resolution of
current international negotiations carries the potential for a sizeable
reflow of dollars, accompanied by large sales of bills by foreign
official accounts and redemption of Treasury special issues. Such
developments might subject the bill market to considerable transitory
upward rate pressures.

I -6
Even without an international settlement, corporate yields
are likely to continue to decline in the weeks ahead in reflection of
an expected decline in December offerings of more than seasonal dimen-
sions, the recent reduction of dealer inventories, and seasonal reinvest-
ment demand after year-end. Declines in Treasury coupon and tax-exempt
yields may be more modest. Dealer inventories--while reduced--are still
large in both markets and the forward calendar of State and local
government offerings remains large.
Mortgage rates are also likely to edge off in the weeks ahead.
Inflows to the thrift institutions--though diminishing somewhat recently--
are expected to remain large, and demands for mortgage credit may sub-
side somewhat as the rate of refinancing slows. The FHLB plans to
raise no new funds in the first quarter, although FNMA plans net new
long-term financings over the same period of about $1.5 billion, mostly
to repay short-term obligations and to acquire mortgages under subsidized
programs.
Business loan demands at banks are unlikely to pick up in the
near term, given staff projections of conservative inventory policies
and growing internal funds generation by the nonfinancial corporate
sector. However, demand for consumer and real estate loans should remain
sizeable, though subsiding somewhat.
International developments
The available statistics on U.S. foreign trade give no clue
as to the influences being exerted by exchange rate changes and the
import surcharge or by changes in aggregate demand here and abroad.

I -7
The trade surplus of September, generated by the rush of exporters to
ship goods before the East Coast dock strike started, was followed by
a trade deficit of record magnitude in October.
Foreign official reserves increased further in October,
November, and early December, by amounts large enough to indicate con-
tinuing buildup of speculative positions in a number of currencies.
Market exchange rates for most of the industrial countries' currencies
rose further. Since about two weeks ago--i.e., since shortly before
the latest G-10 meeting--market expectations about the character of
the eventual settlement of exchange rate questions have produced
especially large reserve increases and sharp advances in market ex-
change rates.
Abroad, the business outlook in Germany remains weak, and
last summer's pickup in British retail sales has not yet spurred indus-
trial production in Britain. In these two countries the rise in whole-
sale prices and also the rise in wages have moderated somewhat in recent
months. In Japan wholesale prices were virtually level from last spring
to August, and since then have declined; Japanese industrial production
fell back in October to the level that had been maintained during the
summer. Wholesale and retail prices in most European industrial countries
have recently been in a range of 3-1/2 to 5-1/2 per cent higher than a
year earlier; in Britain, however, the rise had been considerably
greater.

THE ECONOMIC PICTURE IN DETAIL
Domestic Nonfinancial Scene
Gross national product. The past month has furnished
supporting evidence of a strengthening economic upswing, spearheaded
by personal consumption expenditures and a stronger outlook for business
fixed investment. These developments are reflected in our fourth quarter
projection of final sales (exclusive of net exports) which now increase
by $23.8 billion or about $3.0 billion more than in the preceding
Greenbook. This compares with a revised GNP increase of $17.7 billion
in the third quarter. However, because of adverse effects of the port
strikes on net exports, and a smaller increase now expected in inventory
accumulation, the currently anticipated fourth quarter GNP gain of
$22.2 billion is only fractionally higher than that indicated a month
ago. In real terms, the fourth quarter GNP increase still amounts to
nearly 6 per cent, annual rate.
Retail sales continued to rise at a good pace in October and
November, and were well above the third quarter average. Nondurables,
in particular, were stronger than expected, while sales of new domestic
model cars and other durables remained at the high levels previously
expected. These developments have prompted us to add about $1-1/2
billion to the expected increase in consumption during the current
quarter. In addition, new figures from the OBE-SEC survey suggest a
stronger rise than we had projected earlier for business fixed investment,

II -2
although this up-scaling partly reflects some catch-up following a
shortfall from anticipated expenditures in the third quarter.
We have cut back the anticipated increase in fourth quarter
nonfarm inventories by $1 billion. Increases in production have not
significantly exceeded expansion in sales in the past few months.
Automobile production schedules--at little more than an 8-1/2 million
annual rate for the quarter--continue far short of the pace set by
sales. Moreover, steel inventories were run down considerably in
October, and stocks of coal were depleted as a consequence of the re-
cently settled strike. The port strikes also have resulted in a greater
deterioration of the net export position than we had expected. Net
exports of goods and services are now expected to register a $2 billion
deficit during the quarter--$1 billion more adverse than projected last
month.
The tax bill currently on its way to enactment in Congress
appears to be in line with our earlier assumptions, and our estimates
of Federal Government purchases remain unchanged. However, decisions
regarding payment of retroactive wage increases during the freeze and
pending legislation could affect both Federal , State and local out-
lays as well as private wage and salary payments.

Expected developments in the first quarter appear likely to
provide further thrust to the economy. We now anticipate an increase
in GNP at an annual rate of $29-1/2 billion as compared with $28 billion
projected last month -- with the extra strength reflecting a stronger
gain in capital outlays as suggested in the recent business anticipation
surveys as well as some rebound in net exports following the return
of striking dockworkers. Growth in real GNP would be at about a 6-3/4
per cent rate. Some tax relief and higher social security benefits
should help sustain a high rate of increase in consumer outlays.

II -4
The large increase in disposable personal income is also reflected
in a somewhat higher saving rate for the quarter. Auto sales are
expected to recede somewhat from their levels in the fourth quarter,
but remain relatively strong, and we project a further rise in residential
construction expenditures. Early next year, the housing upswing will
enter its sixth quarter and in view of the mounting volume of housing
completions, may be expected to provide an increased stimulus for sales
of furniture, household furnishings and appliances.

For the rest of 1972, we expect a continuation of the
economic expansion, at a pace slightly greater than projected last
month, with GNP increases of $27 to 28 billion and gains in real GNP
in the 6 to 6-1/2 per cent range. Consumer outlays are expected to be
sustained by increases in employment and personal income and improved
consumer confidence, with the saving rate dropping to under 7 per cent
by year-end. We are projecting automobile sales and housing starts to
remain on a historically high plateau for the remainder of 1972. Sizable
increases in fixed and inventory investment during the course of the
year seem increasingly likely as the economic upturn becomes more firmly
established and as profits and the rate of capacity utilization improve.
A resolution of some of the issues in international monetary and trade
policy and a substantial realignment of exchange rates should react
favorably on our trade balance, and we expect a modest surplus in net
exports of goods and services in the last half of the year.
Overall, we continue to assume that the rate of price increase
will ease to an annual rate of less than 3 per cent after a first
quarter spurt reflecting some post-freeze adjustments. Employment gains
are expected to exceed labor force growth, resulting in a decline in
the unemployment rate to 5.3 per cent by the fourth quarter.

Industrial production. Industrial production in November is
estimated to have increased appreciably more than in October, with
gains in output widespread and with strength particularly evident in
business equipment and materials.
The coal strike was settled in mid-November and, although
not all miners have returned to work, the rise in production should
amount to .2 or .3 of a point in the total index. Output of textiles
and chemicals is estimated to have increased further. Raw steel pro-
duction has been about unchanged but trade reports indicate further
weakening in nonferrous metals, especially aluminum.
Production worker manhour data suggest a further rise in out-
put of industrial and commercial equipment, a leveling off in aircraft
production (since August) following a long and deep contraction, but
some further reduction in defense equipment. Production of trucks was
maintained at record levels.
Output of consumer goods is estimated to have increased
somewhat further as production of furniture, some appliances, and
consumer staples rose. Auto assemblies were about unchanged from the
October annual rate of 8.5 million units and little change is expected
in December.
Since the beginning of the year there has been a modest
recovery in industrial production. Output of consumer goods rose
sharply in the second quarter to a new high and then edged up further
through October. Production of business equipment reached its low in

II -10
the fourth quarter of 1970, showed little change through May 1971, and
then rose 4 per cent in the following five months. Output of materials
was dominated by the rise and fall in steel production and in October
by the coal strike. However, materials production, excluding steel and
coal, has also shown some recovery so far in 1971.

Retail sales. The stronger rate of growth in retail sales
which began in August appears to have continued through November with
sales for the month up more than 1 per cent from October, according to
estimates based on weekly data. Strength over the past four months--
while uneven from month to month--has been widespread among store types.
Sales apparently increased at about the same rate in November at both
durable and nondurable goods stores.

Unit auto sales. Sales of new domestic-type autos were at a
9.5 million unit annual rate in November, down 7 per cent from the
advanced October pace. The sales rate was progressively lower in each
10-day period of November. Since August 21, domestic-type sales have
averaged a 9.6 million unit rate, sharply above the 8.3 million rate of
the seven and one-half months before the announcement of the new
economic program.

1.5 million units, up 15 per cent from October and the import share of
total sales rose slightly to 12 per cent. In the first seven and one-
half months of 1971, sales of imported cars were also at a 1.5 million
unit rate; since mid-August, when they were slowed by dock strikes, sales
have been at a 1.4 million unit average rate.

Consumer credit. The rate of increase in consumer instalment
credit outstanding in October remained close to the record September
pace. On a seasonally adjusted basis the increase amounted to $11.1
billion (annual rate) compared with $12.0 billion in September; during
the preceding 6-month period--March through August--the annual rate of
expansion was $7.5 billion.

II -13
Extensions of instalment credit during October were down
slightly from September, as were repayments. The contraction in these
totals resulted largely from reductions in automobile financing activity.
Both extensions and repayments for nonautomotive consumer goods and
personal loans were higher in October than in September.

Consumer surveys. New consumer surveys by the Conference
Board and Michigan Survey Research Center present an ambiguous outlook
for consumer demand. But it should be noted that the first round of
consumer surveys after the August 15 announcement of the New Economic
Program failed to anticipate the surge in auto sales and the improved
volume of other types of retail sales during the past few months.

II -14
The Conference Board October survey found more households
reporting jobs hard to get and fewer respondents expecting short-term
business conditions to improve. However, there was some pickup in
evaluations of present business conditions and a very slight increase
in families expecting higher income. Moreover, there was a strong
increase in purchase plans for major appliances, and home buying plans
remain at a high level--although off fractionally from August. Purchase
plans for new cars are about the same as in August and a year earlier.
The Michigan index of consumer sentiment in November was
82.2 (February 1966=100), not significantly changed from 82.4 in September
and 81.6 in May. There were conflicting trends in responses to the
index questions. On the favorable side, a high number reported that it
is a good time to buy household durables and more respondents noted an
improvement in their personal financial situation. On the other hand,
expectations for improved business conditions during the next 12 months
declined rather sharply.
The disparity between previous surveys and the actual strength
in auto sales may be attributable to families bunching purchases in
advance of expected price increases. (Buying plan questions have a
specific time horizon such as "within next 6 months.") The last three
Michigan surveys indicated an increase in purchases because of expected
inflation, and the latest release suggests that this buying borrows from
future demand. However, equally plausible possibilities are that
spending by some consumers will increase the confidence of other households

II -15
and that actual events will show that families are unduly pessimistic
about the economic outlook. Consumption of durables and confidence,
as measured by the Michigan index, has changed quite rapidly in the past.
Manufacturers' orders and shipments. New orders for durable
goods have continued to show relatively little strength; they increased
0.6 per cent in October (preliminary), following a September decline of
2.3 per cent. A major factor in the October increase was a sharp rise
in the volatile defense series. Iron and steel orders, which had
increased sharply in September, dropped back somewhat in October. Exclud-
ing both defense and steel, orders were down 0.9 per cent in October from
September and from the third quarter.

Orders for capital equipment increased 1.7 per cent and were
above the third-quarter average but the October level was no higher
than January of this year. The capital equipment -orders series, like
other related series such as contracts and orders for plant and equip-
ment, fluctuates more than actual spending and has not had a clear,
consistent relationship to business spending on plant and equipment.
Therefore, the absence of a noticeable increase in orders is not
necessarily inconsistent with anticipated increases in fixed capital
spending shown by recent surveys. But recent sluggishness in new orders
for capital equipment--especially after adjustment for price change--and
the continued decline in unfilled orders suggest little likelihood of
immediate stimulus to inventory accumulation from this sector.
Motor vehicle shipments and orders declined somewhat, after a
high third quarter that may have reflected in part the earlier model
changeover this year. Orders for "other durables" (which includes
construction materials) declined.
Shipments of durable goods declined 0.6 per cent in October;
mainly in the motor vehicles group. Unfilled orders for durables were
down very slightly.
Inventories. Book value of manufacturers' inventories rose
at a $3.8 billion annual rate in October, according to preliminary
data--up from the September rate of $2.4 billion and in contrast to a
reduction of $1.1 billion, annual rate, in the third quarter. The
turn-around in the last two months reflected accumulation of non-
durable goods and of durable goods other than materials; durable

II -17
materials stocks were run down rapidly in both months, perhaps reflecting
use of coal stockpiles as well as of steel stockpiles in October.
The overall rate of inventory growth in manufacturing remains
modest--compared for example with the period following the steel
settlement in 1968--reflecting such factors as the greater overhang of
materials stocks, the absence of stimulus from new orders for defense
or capital equipment, and an abundance of productive capacity.
The book value of stocks in wholesale trade increased
appreciably in October. Liquidation at metals and nondurables dealers
was much smaller than in September.

Factory shipments declined in October and the inventory-
shipments ratio rose to 1.75 from 1.73 in September. The increase in
stocks relative to shipments in October was particularly noticeable at
nondurable goods producers where the ratio rose to the highest point
since January. There may have been some backup of stocks of goods for
export as a result of the East and Gulf Coast dock strikes which began
in October, but the increase did not occur in the machinery industry
which is a major exporter.
The wholesale inventory-sales ratio rose in October and was
at the year-earlier level. The increase in the ratio occurred both for
nondurables and for durables other than motor vehicles and metals.

Cyclical indicators. The preliminary Census composite leading
indicator rose 1.2 per cent in October to a new high. However, the
increase resulted mainly from a large rise in one component, building
permits. There were also increases in the manufacturing workweek
(preliminary) and new orders for durable goods, and a decline in initial
claims for unemployment insurance (treated inversely in the index). The
ratio of price to unit labor cost was unchanged, and there were declines
in contracts and orders for plant and equipment, materials prices, and
common stock prices. Since the preliminary composite was compiled,
both the workweek and new orders were revised upward, and the workweek
rose further in November.

Construction and real estate. Seasonally adjusted expenditures
for new construction put in place, at an annual rate of $112 billion in
November, about matched the advanced October pace and continued just
below the record level reached last August. Changes in major types of
construction were generally small and offsetting.
In November, rising construction costs continued to contribute
to the year-to-year increases shown by the current dollar figures. As
measured by the Census Bureau, the implied year-to-year advance in over-
all costs during the month amounted to 8 per cent, although this was
down from nearly 10 per cent in August.

Seasonally adjusted private housing starts turned upward
again in October and exceeded a 2 million annual rate for the third
month this year. Moreover, with permits at a record pace in October
and mortgage commitments for both subsidized and non-subsidized units
still exceptionally high, starts in the remaining months of the year may
rise sufficiently further to carry the average for the fourth quarter
above the 2.14 million unit rate in the third quarter. If attained, this
would raise the average for all of 1971 above the 2 million unit mark for
the first time in the history of the series, and in a year when mobile
home shipments--also experiencing a record pace--may add as much as
500,000 to the total count of "shelter units." In 1970, the "shelter
count" was just over 1.8 million, including 400,000 mobiles.
Although vacancy rates in general have remained relatively
low, a factor which may operate to limit a further rise in private
housing starts beyond this year's indicated second-half pace is the
much higher level of completions which is now beginning to develop.

began in the second quarter of 1970, the seasonally adjusted rate of

By the third quarter of this year, however, total completions--which, as
defined by the Census Bureau, exclude mobile homes--were at a seasonally

unprecedented for this series, was some 400,000 units under the annual

Planned expenditures for new plant and equipment. The
Commerce-SEC November survey of business plans for expenditures on new
plant and equipment indicates larger gains for the next few quarters
than had been anticipated earlier. Following a slight decline in the
third quarter, spending is expected to increase by about 4 per cent in
both the fourth and first quarters. In the second quarter of 1972,
however, the rate of gain is expected to slow to about 2 per cent.
If spending in the last half of 1972 were to remain at the
anticipated second quarter level, the increases shown for the first
half of the year alone would imply a somewhat stronger (8.3 per cent)
gain for the year than the 7 per cent indicated for 1972 by the recent
McGraw-Hill survey.
Spending in the third quarter of 1971 fell short of earlier
expectations, but all of the shortfall is expected to be made up in
the fourth quarter so that the expected gain for 1971 as a whole remains
at about 2 per cent.

The strength in the new fixed capital plans is concentrated
in the nonmanufacturing sector of the economy--especially communications
and commercial firms. In manufacturing a decline in spending was reported
for the third quarter, but outlays are expected to rise sharply in the
fourth quarter as the shortfall is more than made up. The figures show
little change thereafter.
This pattern for manufacturing is roughly consistent with the
Conference Board new capital appropriations survey which had indicated
a depressed level of appropriations until the third quarter of 1971 when
a sharp rise was reported. Since changes in expenditures tend to follow
appropriations by about two to three quarters little strength seems
likely in manufacturing expenditures before mid-1972. After that, the
appropriations figures (and the strong rise in manufacturing outlays
for 1972 as a whole reported by the McGraw-Hill Survey) suggest a sub-
stantial recovery in capital expenditures in this sector.

Labor market. Unemployment edged back up in November by 0.2
percentage points to 6.0 per cent, seasonally adjusted, the same as the
rate in September. The rise reflected a larger growth in the civilian
labor force than in total employment. Over half the rise in unemploy-
ment in November occurred among adult women, but unemployment rates
rose for most groups. An exception was the rate for Negro workers
which fell to 9.3 per cent--the lowest this year.
In general, the unemployment situation has remained essen-
tially unchanged during the past year, with the unemployment rate
fluctuating around the 6 per cent mark, and the number of jobless
workers about 200,000 higher than a year ago. But there is some indica-
tion that layoffs, as reflected in claims for unemployment compensation,
have been trending downward in recent weeks.

Total employment (household survey) increased by 200,000 in
November, but the civilian labor force grew by almost 400,000. Most
of the growth this November occurred among women and teenagers. The
civilian labor force has increased about 1.7 million over the last year,
about in line with trends in population growth and participation rates.
Nonfarm payroll employment showed only a moderate gain in
November, rising 84,000 after a decline of 20,000 in October. The
80,000 coal miners who were on strike during October and the first half
of November returned to work after the reporting week and are not in-
cluded in either the October or November job count. Manufacturing em-
ployment was up by 40,000. The gains were entirely among production
workers, as non-production worker employment continued to show little
strength. Outside of manufacturing, employment continued to grow moder-
ately in services and State and local government. Employment in the
trade sector was reported down by 50,000.
The number of employees on nonfarm payrolls has increased by
460,000 since the beginning of the year, but the level attained in
November was still 230,000 below the peak reached in March 1970. Most
of the gain has been in services and State and local government; factory
employment is still 1.7 million below the record high reached in July
1969.
On the stronger side, average weekly hours of factory workers
rose 0.3 hours to 40.1 in November (seasonally adjusted) due to large
increases in the machinery and transportation equipment industries. The
increase in the work week, however, may be due in part to seasonal adjust-
ment problems, since this is the first year in which Veterans Day did

II -28
not fall in November. Generally, the factory workweek has been relatively
stable since early this year, at about 40 hours per week.

Earnings. The rate of increase in wages slowed dramatically
during the wage freeze. Average hourly earnings of production workers
on private nonfarm payrolls rose at an annual rate of only 1.2 per cent
from August to November, far below the January-August rate. Significant
slowdowns in earnings growth were evident in all industries--particularly
manufacturing, trade and finance. The peculiar August-November movement
in mining is due to the coal strike.
Relatively few actions have been announced so far by the Pay
Board. The only recent major wage settlement, involving 80,000 coal
miners was treated by the Board as an "existing" contract--signed before
the end of the freeze--and therefore not subject to the 5 1/2 per centChange

guideline for wage and benefit increases. The major action of the Board
so far, has been its restriction on the retroactive payment of most wage
increases that had been effective during the freeze period. The Board
now has under consideration several major wage settlements, including
aerospace and railroadssignalmen, with proposed increases substantially
above the guideline.

Industrial relations. The number of workers on strike in key
industries was sharply reduced during November. The bituminous coal
miners ratified a new three-year contract just before the 90-day freeze
expired at midnight November 13. Most of the 80,000 coal miners returned
to work the following week. The first year of the agreement, according
to estimates of the coal operators, provides for a 15.8 per cent increase
in wage and benefit costs.
East and Gulf Coast longshoremen were ordered back to work
November 26 and 27 after the President requested an 80-day injunction

II -30
under the Taft-Hartley Act. West Coast longshoremen who have been
operating under a Taft-Hartley injunction since October 6 will be free
to strike again after December 24.
In the aerospace industry, where major contracts covering
200,000 workers expire this year, the first breakthrough in contract
negotiations came when a new agreement was reached recently by North
American Rockwell Corporation and 20,000 members of the UAW. The
settlement was patterned after the 1970 auto contracts with a large
first-year "catch-up" wage increase reported at about 12 per cent to
be followed by 3 per cent increases in the second and third contract
years. The ceiling on cost-of-living adjustments was also removed as
in the auto contracts. Since this is a new contract, the increase has
to be approved by the Pay Board.
Productivity and labor costs. Productivity and unit labor
cost data for the private economy and the private nonfarm economy
have been revised by BLS to reflect the new upward revision in third
quarter estimates of real GNP. In the private nonfarm economy, output
per manhour rose at an annual rate of 3.4 per cent during the third
quarter compared to the earlier estimate of 2.1 per cent. Consequently,
the estimated increase in unit labor costs was reduced to 2 per cent
(annual rate) from the 3.2 per cent reported earlier. Although BLS will
not publish revised data for manufacturing output per manhour and unit
labor costs to reflect third quarter revisions in the Board's production
index, the FRB estimate of output per manhour shows a decline of 0.7 per
cent (annual rate) during the third quarter compared with the earlier
BLS estimate of a 2.1 per cent decline. As a result, the rise in

II -31
manufacturing unit labor costs is estimated at a 5.2 per cent annual
rate, compared with the 6.7 per cent unrevised BLS estimate.

Wholesale prices. Between October and November, the whole-

industrial commodities was up only marginally.

at an annual rate, with almost all of the increase due to increases
for domestically produced raw agricultural commodities. If raw
agricultural commodities and imports are excluded, the unadjusted
WPI shows no change.

For industrial commodities, seasonally adjusted increases
for lumber and wood products, hides and skins, and metals and metal
products about offset declines in prices of chemicals, fuels, and
machinery and equipment.
The distribution of the direction of price change for industrial
product classes computed monthly by the BLS was similar in November
to the pattern of the previous two months but was substantially different
from a year earlier and from earlier months of 1972.

Changes reported for groups classified by state of processing
also were small. Prices of consumer nonfood finished goods increased
slightly, with consumer nondurables unchanged and consumer durables up,
largely because of a seasonally adjusted increase for passenger cars.
Producer finished goods declined chiefly as a result of lower prices
reported for machinery and equipment. Indexes of both crude and inter-
mediate materials declined.

Thus far, the Price Commission has received requests for price
increases from about one-third of the 1300 large firms who are required
to obtain prior approval. Some have been granted in full, some in
part, and in a few cases firms have been refused price increases and
have been asked to submit further data. Automobile producers generally
have been allowed increases of between 2-1/2 and 3 per cent (Chrysler
was permitted over 4 per cent) in comparison with tentative announcements
made prior to the freeze that prices would be raised 4 to 5 per cent.
A major steel company has been allowed an average increase of 3.6 per cent
on all products with the option of distributing the increase among
products as they see fit. The increase granted in this case would permit
substantial increases on products, such as sheets, which had not been
raised prior to the freeze.
The Price Commission has announced that in the case of coal,
and presumably in other cases where wage settlements are substantially
in excess of the 5-1/2 per cent guideline it will not allow the full
price increase needed to absorb increases in labor costs.
Consumer prices. Consumer prices rose in October at a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 1.6 per cent, less than the 2.4 per cent rise in
September and well below the 4.4 per cent average between May and August.
Prices of food were unchanged from September, while for nonfood commodities
prices actually declined (both seasonally adjusted). The rate of rise in
service costs, meanwhile, was reduced sharply. Lags in recording
price changes that apparently occurred prior to the freeze account for
much of the increae. The net effect on the index of exempted items
and imports was minor.

II -35
For foods, less than seasonal declines for meats, poultry
and fresh fruits were offset by larger than or even contraseasonal--
declines for dairy and cereal and bakery products. In September a sharp
drop in the index for fresh fruits and vegetables had resulted in a
fall in the index for all food and was a significant factor in holding
down the increase in the "All items" index. The cost of.restaurant
meals rose at an annual rate of only 1 per cent, in contrast to a 5 per
cent increase over the previous 12 months.

Among other commodities, apparel prices rose about 5 per cent
at a seasonally adjusted annual rate. Apparel prices in October include
those for fall and winter items in a sample of cities which had not been
priced since July. The increase was much larger than seasonal, and larger
than the seasonally adjusted rise in September.

II -36
Seasonally adjusted, new car prices fell in October. This
decline may be exaggerated, in view of the difficulties of making
appropriate seasonal adjustments at a time when suggested dealer
prices of the new (1972) models were frozen and when both 1971 and
1972 models were being sold in volume and at various discounts.
When finally enacted, the elimination of the excise tax on autos is
expected to be phased retroactively into the index for August and
September. The price increases recently granted on new autos by the
Price Commission will first enter the index in December.

The rise in service costs--at an annual rate of about 2 per
cent including home financing costs, and zero excluding them--was held
down in October by the annual adjustment for retained earnings in the
health insurance component.1/ This adjustment for retained earnings,
together with the increase in college tuition charges included in the
September index, accounts for most of the difference between the rise in
service costs in September and October. However, the increase in home
maintenance and repair service costs slowed in October to an annual
rate of about 2-1/2 per cent from an average of 11 per cent over the
previous quarter.
The rise in rents--about 3 per cent at an annual rate--was
similar to that in the previous quarter and well below the rate of
over 5 per cent between September 1970 and June 1971. However, recent
increases reflect changes over a six-month interval. Just as increases
actually made prior to Phase I have entered the index in the last two
months, the increases under Phase II will enter the index during the
next half-year instead of registering their full effect immediately.
The Chairman of the Price Commission has urged landlords
to postpone increases, cautioning about possible rollbacks, until

guidelines are spelled out by the recently named Rent Advisory Board.
Rent increases averaging about 5 per cent and affecting 10 to 20 per
cent of apartments have been reported as planned in the Washington
area, for example, with some rent increase notices already mailed
out. Units controlled by State and local agencies have been exempted
from Phase II guidelines and increases of up to 7.5 per cent, post-
poned during Phase I, will affect controlled units in New York be-
ginning in January. The increase last December in controlled rents
in New York contributed significantly to the acceleration in service
costs (excluding home finance) in the last quarter of 1970 and first
quarter of 1971.
Announced increases for utility rates suggest a similar
reversal of trend for a component which has contributed significantly
to the slowing of the rise in service costs over the past four months.
Gas and electricity, priced monthly, showed no change in September
or October.

II -39
Farm situation. Abundant 1971 harvests are helping to ease
the price control problems of Phase II but are posing difficult problems
for farmers and the Commodity Credit Corporation. Crop output is 13
per cent above last year and 9 per cent above the previous record crop
of 1969. The 5.55 billion bushel corn crop overshot the USDA target
by 16 per cent and a record wheat crop exceeds prospective demand by a
fifth. The soybean crop, also a record, appears to be in close balance
with expected needs. These huge crops would have strained transport and
storage facilities in any case but prolonged work stoppages at ports
and interior elevators have aggravated these problems and intensified
downward pressure on prices, corn in particular.

loan but storage capacity is still a limiting factor for many farmers
eligible for loans. Open market purchases of corn just announced by
the USDA is an emergency program designed to bolster corn prices. CCC
net expenditures for price support are soaring and expenditures for
the year are now expected to exceed the $3.7 billion projected in last
January's budget estimate by $1.2 billion.
Nationally, falling grain prices since midyear have been
countered by rising prices of livestock and some crops so:that it
appears that net income realized by farmers in 1971 may be close to the
$15.6 billion of last year.
On a quarterly basis, net realized income has zoomed upward
from $14.2 billion (seasonally adjusted annual rate) in the fall of
1970 to $16.3 billion in the third quarter of 1971 and it is likely to
stay close to this level through mid-1972 at least. Higher hog and
cattle prices are boosting cash receipts from sales of livestock and
expanded volume of crop marketings is holding up cash receipts from the
sales of crops. At the same time, the long-term upward creep of pro-
duction expenses has leveled out, primarily as a result of declining
feed costs but also as a result of the price freeze.
Prospects are less clear for the second half of 1972. Live-
stock prices are expected to continue strong since hog marketings are
likely to remain well below year earlier levels and a cutback in egg
production is in prospect. Much will depend on how producers respond
to the 1972 programs designed to bring feed grain and wheat supplies
into better balance with demands.

THE ECONOMIC PICTURE IN DETAIL
Domestic Financial Situation
Monetary Aggregates. Preliminary data indicate that the
narrow money stock (M1) grew at an annual rate of about 1 percent
during November, bringing the average level for the month back to
acout the same point as in July. The November figure, however, as
well as that for October and to some extent September, will be revised
shortly to correct for the influence of institutional changes in bank-
ing structure and of mechanics of clearing procedures that have just
come to light.1/ Detailed data are not yet available, but the present
small rate of increase for November probably will be adjusted to a small
rate of decline, while the small rate of decline for October probably will
be converted to a small rate of increase. For the two months together, how-
ever, the average rate of change should be little affected. Thus, these
adjustments will not alter the fundamental picture of recent weakness in M1.
1/ These revisions will be presented in the forthcoming Bluebook and
will be reflected in the data published Thursday, December 9. One
of the structural changes underlying the forthcoming adjustments
is the opening of two new branches of foreign banks in New York.
The effect of their operations is to create a cash items bias for
which a correction will be made. In addition, several large
internationally-oriented institutions have been incorporated
since early November into the Clearing House Interbank Payments
System for clearing foreign transactions in New York (CHIPS) and
other similar institutions will be brought into this or the
related Paper Exchange Payments System (PEPS) in the near future.
Although some adjustments are required since early November,
henceforth this should cause no revisions in the published money
stock.

The broad money stock (M2) increased at about a 7.5 per cent
rate during November, as time and savings deposits other than large
negotiable CD's continued to expand rapidly. The recent high rates
of growth in such deposits are well above those recorded during the
third quarter, presumably reflecting the continued favorable yield
differential on these instruments in relation to open market securities.
Growth in the adjusted credit proxy increased sharply during
November to the highest rate since February. The major factor was the
increase in time and savings deposits. In addition the rapid growth
in the proxy reflected an increase in Government deposits and a heavier
use of nondeposit sources of funds, particularly Euro-dollars, beginning
around mid-month. The increased Euro-dollar borrowing occurred despite
a progressive widening of the cost differential against such funds as
compared with Federal funds or CD's of similar maturity, as banks
evidently were attempting to maintain their reserve-free bases for
such borrowing. By the last week of November, however, the premium
on one-day Euro-dollars over Federal funds reached a full percentage
point, and a sizeable portion of the earlier rise in Euro-dollar
borrowing was reversed.
Offsetting some of the expansion in net interbank balances
and nondeposit sources of funds, the amount of large negotiable CD's
outstanding declined on average during November. Much of the reduction
had already occurred by the beginning of the month, however, in
response to the progressive decline in CD offering rates during October.

III -4
Banks continued to be unaggressive bidders for CD's throughout the
month in view of the strength of other time deposit flows and the
weakness in business loan demand.
Bank credit. Total loans and investments at commercial banks
adjusted for loans sold to affiliates (last Wednesday-of-month basis)
grew at an annual rate of 7 per cent in November,the slowest expansion
since July. Business loans adjusted for sales to affiliates, declining
at a 6 per cent annual rate,were the weakest since June, despite late-
October and early-November reductions in the prime rate. 7/ The drop
in business loans is consistent with the findings of the recent
surveys of Bank Lending Practices and Loan Commitments (to be presented
in appendices to the Supplement) and was spread over a number of
industrial categories. Loans to firms in the metal industry--primary
metals producers and manufacturers of machinery, transportation
equipment and other fabricated metal products--were the weakest,
perhaps reflecting a further rundown of steel inventories accumulated
earlier in the year. In addition, loans to chemical and, to some
extent, petroleum firms also showed less strength than is usual for
November. On the other hand, loans to public utilities were somewhat
stronger, and banks increased their holdings of bankers' acceptances,
which are not reported on an industry basis, slightly more than is
usual for November.
7/ First National City Bank and the Irving Trust Company, both of whom
recently adopted "floating" prime rates, further reduced their basic
lending rates to 5-1/4 per cent in late November. First National
City increased its rate to 5-3/8 per cent early in December, while
most other commercial banks continue to quote a prime rate of
5-1/2 per cent.

In contrast to the weakness in business loans during November,
real estate loans and consumer loans continued to grow rapidly. These
were the only identifiable spots of strength in loan demand, however,
and the liquidity of large commercial banks--as measured by the ratio
of short-term liquid assets to total liabilities less capital and
reserves--remained high relative to recent years. Bank holdings of
securities other than U.S. Governments increased again on a seasonally
adjusted basis, although at a slower rate than in recent months.
Holdings of U.S. Government securities were up slightly in November
following four months of decline, but this was primarily due to the
return of the Treasury to a more "normal" financing pattern after
a period of unusually light new offerings in domestic markets.

III -6
Nonbank thrift institutions. Deposit inflows to the nonbank
thrift institutions as a group declined slightly during November,
according to estimates based on limited data. There was some diver-
gence in individual patterns, however, with savings banks showing an
increase in the pace of their inflows and savings and loan associations
recording a decline.

Mortgage market. FNMA auction results suggest that the gradual
decline in secondary market yields on FHA and VA home mortgages that
had been under way since last summer gathered some additional momentum
during November. By the end of the month, average yields on FNMA
short-term forward purchase commitments were down to 7.66 per cent--41
basis points below the high of late July and the lowest level since
late spring. 1/
1/ In view of the accompanying decline in discount points on Government
underwritten mortgages, discount subsidies for existing-home loans
have been suspended since mid-November under GNMA's new Tandem Plan,
instituted in August. Although GNMA continues to subsidize discounts
on eligible loans on new homes and apartments, the effective amount
of the subsidy has dropped to less than 1 point. To date, subsidies
paid out by GNMA under the new Tandem Plan have totaled $20 million.

Further declines in secondary market yields are widely expected
according to FNMA field reports. To profit from the associated rise in
mortgage prices that is anticipated, mortgage companies are apparently
continuing to hold a substantial volume of loans without obtaining resale
commitments. This speculative practice has been facilitated by the
ready availability of credit at costs that are low relative to the yields
generated by the mortgages pledged as collateral.
In the sluggish primary market, November data for the FHA
series on conventional home mortgages may be available in time for the
Greenbook Supplement. During October, this series edged down to 7.80

III -9
per cent on new-home loans--the first decline since last spring. On
existing-home loans, rates remained unchanged at 7.90 per cent for the
third consecutive month. For both types of loans, the FHLBB series
for October shows that credit was extended at loan-to-value ratios
and maturities that continued to be quite liberal by historical
standards.
The seasonally adjusted rate of mortgage credit extensions
has apparently slackened from the exceptionally rapid pace reached
in late summer and early fall. This slowing is attributable to a
great extent to a reduction in the backlog of credit demand, which
had mushroomed earlier this year in response to increased availability
of funds at costs well below 1970 highs. It may also have reflected
the moderation of net savings inflows to nonbank thrift institutions
from the all-time high reached in the first quarter.
Corporate and municipal securities markets. Yields on corporate
bonds have risen only slightly since the last Committee meeting, even
though dealers have worked off heavy inventories in the face of cautious
buying by institutional investors. The lightening of the forward
calendar and the scarcity of industrial bonds made it possible for
corporate underwriters to continue an aggressive pricing policy on
new utility issues and at the same time to terminate syndicates on
older issues without appreciable upward pressure on yields. As a
result, over the last 5 weeks new issue yields on high-grade corporate
bonds have risen only about 1/8 of a percentage point, although,
sales of new issues have remained relatively slow.

III -10
On the other hand, municipal yields increased substantially,
with the most widely quoted index rising 45 basis points during the
month of November. While municipal dealers are presently in a some-
what better technical position-because the yield advances facilitated
a sharp reduction in their inventories of new issues--stocks of
seasoned tax-exempt securities remain unusually high. Furthermore,
the slower pace of commercial bank acquisitions, which apparently
contributed to the recent back-up of yields, appears to be continuing.
The forward calendar remains formidable, taking into account the normal
holiday slowing of market activity.

Stock prices have rallied sharply since the Thanksgiving
holiday--after drifting steadily downward during October and most of
November--and are now slightly higher than on August 13, immediately
preceding the announcement of Phase I. The volume of transactions
during this rally has been considerably larger than for the immediately
preceding weeks, with NYSE daily trading volume averaging 17.4 million
shares since November 26, as compared with 12-13 million for October
and November. The market seems to have been encouraged by report of
progress towards an international monetary settlement; and, in addition,
there is some indication that the small investor's much publicized
lack of confidence in the stock market may now be abating somewhat.
For example, NYSE data for most of November show that the odd-lot
investors, who had been strong net sellers throughout 1971, have
greatly narrowed the gap between their sales and purchases in recent
weeks. Mutual fund sales have also picked up.

Public bond offerings by corporations in November matched
the October total of approximately $2 billion, just below the monthly
average for 1971 thus far. At this time, the December calendar includes
only about $1.3 billion of public bonds--a larger drop than seasonal
considerations alone would suggest--and all of these issues are by
utilities or financial firms. There are also almost $500 million of
offerings, mainly by corporations in the banking and finance sectors,
that have been filed but have no scheduled date of issue. No
industrial bonds are scheduled for the month of December. Most under-
writers expect an increase in new issue volume in January, however,
presumably to take advantage of the seasonal increase in supply of
funds to the market.
On the basis of recent revisions in SEC data, it appears that
private placement activity has remained relatively stable. New equity
financing in November was at about the level previously estimated for
that month, but announcements of new issues in December have not built
up so rapidly and the staff now expects December volume to be only $650
million. Mainly because of a decline in public long-term issues by
industrial firms, therefore, total corporate security offerings for
December are estimated at only $2.7 billion, the lowest monthly total
since August of 1971. However, present financing plans suggest a
return to the $3 billion level early in 1972.

Tax-exempt bond issues reached a total of almost $2.2 billion
in November, and gross sales of short-term municipal securities were
more than $2.7 billion. The staff expects the December volume to
decline seasonally, but State and local government borrowing plans
suggest a continued large volume of long-term financing early next
year.
Revised data show a smaller-than-expected paydown of short-
term municipal debt in October, and in November the surge in gross issues
resulted in an unusually large addition to short-term debt. The staff
now estimates that the total rise in short-term debt outstanding in
1971 will be over $4.0 billion. Although this increase in short-term

III -14
debt is appreciably below the $4.7 billion total for 1970, it indicates
the continued reliance of municipalities on short-term financing. For
the period from 1960 through 1968, the average annual volume of net
short-term sales was about $900 million; but from 1969 through 1971, the
average yearly addition to short-term debt outstanding was $4.0 billion.

Government securities market. Interest rates in the Govern-
ment securities market have risen only slightly on balance since the
last Committee meeting. Rates rose until around Thanksgiving when they
stabilized and then moved back toward mid-November levels. Over the
whole period, yields on coupon issues are generally unchanged to 12
basis points higher, with most of the increases in the over 7-year maturity

III -15
area. Bill rates also are generally unchanged to 12 basis higher, with
the increase mostly in longer bills perhaps reflecting the increased
supply due to the new offerings of tax bills.

The upward movement in rates on coupon issues immediately
following the last Committee meeting can be traced primarily to the
general congestion that developed in securities markets at that time,

III -16
due in large measure to the heavy dealer positions arising out of
the November Treasury refunding. Market professionals became a bit
restive about the inventory buildup because of deepening uncertainties
about the likely results of the President's new domestic and inter-
national economic programs. However, as money market conditions evened
and progress seemed to be being made on an international settlement
market sentiment improved. At the same time, market professionals
managed to lighten inventories, primarily through price adjustments,
and the Open Market Account became a significant buyer of Treasury
coupon issues. Given the need for reserve injections and the avail-
able supply of longer-maturities, the Desk had purchased about $850
million of coupon issues since the last meeting.
The bill market had also been subject to supply pressures,
especially in the shortened Thanksgiving week when there were three
bill auctions--the regular weekly and monthly auctions plus a $2.5
billion auction of April tax bills. The three-month bill, for
instance, rose 30 basis points from the data of the last meeting through
November 26. However, with the lower recent level of the Federal
funds rate and renewed substantial foreign participation in the
market, bill rates etabilized and moved lower after November 26, with
the 3-month bill now around 4.10 per cent, the same level as at the
time of the last meeting. Continued foreign central bank acquisition
of dollars in exchange markets has led to their purchasing about
$2-1/2 billion of U. S. Government securities (most in bills) since

III -17
November 1. This substantial demand for bills, especially in the last
week, has enabled dealers to reduce their bill positions to about $3 billion.
About $500 million of new money was raised in the Federal
Agency Market in the last half of November. FNMA continued its substan-
tial credit demands by raising $500 million; the October figure was
$550 million. Given the large overhang in the Treasury market, the
FNMA issues--especially the two long options with eight and thirteen
years maturities--received rather cool receptions and moved to dis-
counts after reaching the market. The only operation by the System
in this market was a $161 million purchase, including $33 million
with maturities over 5 years.

Other short-term credit markets. Short-term rates, other
than those on Treasury securities, have remained unchanged or declined
slightly since the last meeting of the Committee, in contrast with
the fairly pronounced rise and fall in Treasury bill rates noted in
the preceding section. However, there was some small downward and
upward adjustments in rates by commercial paper dealers, which led to
corresponding changes in the prime rates of the New York City banks
that adjust this rate to changes in the 90-day commercial paper rate.
Nonbank commercial and finance company paper data available
through the week ending November 24 show a seasonally adjusted decline
of $444 million in outstandings to $28.5 billion. Further declines
are expected through the end of the month.
The decline has been exclusively in directly-placed finance
company paper. Several finance companies borrowed in the long-term
market during November, which may have reduced their demands for funds
on the commercial paper market. In addition, there are indications
that finance companies borrowed fairly heavily in this market in
October in anticipation of their November and December need for funds.

Federal finance. The Staff continues to project a unified
budget deficit of about $29 billion for fiscal year 1972. There have
been no significant revisions in the Staff budget estimates or in the
fiscal assumptions listed in the preceding Greenbook. As expected,
the House-Senate conference committee adopted most of the provisions of
the House version of the tax bill rather than the more costly bill
approved by the Senate. The most important tax measure initiated by
the Senate that is likely to survive is the child care deduction,
estimated to cost about $300 million annually. A highly uncertain
staff assumption on the receipts side is the timing of the withdrawal

III -22
of the import surcharge, now assumed to continue through calendar 1972,
with an estimated $2.0 billion annual rate effect on receipts.
Considerable uncertainty remains in the estimate of outlays
for the current fiscal year. In the first five months of the fiscal
year, cash outlays have been somewhat smaller than expected. In parti-
cular, the rate of defense spending (aside from pay raises) in relation
to the anticipated fiscal year total figure appears to be 3 per cent
($2.0 billion) or more behind last year's spending rate. The outlook
for defense spending is further complicated by the fact that Congress
has not completed action on current year defense appropriations. Other
developments adding to uncertainty include the recent Senate approval
of a Federal pay increase, effective January 1, 1972, (which is not
included in Staff estimates and which would increase current fiscal
year outlays by about $1.1 billion), and the failure, as yet, of Congress
to act on the liberalization of social security benefit provisions, which
our projections assume to be effective in January 1972 and which would
cost $1.5 billion in the current fiscal year.
The Staff continues to project a $5.0 billion shift toward
deficit in the high employment budget from calendar 1971 to calendar
1972. However, in the present circumstance this change in the high
employment budget is difficult to interpret. The way price changes
enter the calculations may tend to overstate high employment receipts
when the rate of price increases is affected by control measures.
Also, the high employment budget does not adequately reflect the magni-
tude and timing of the impact of the import surcharge and the investment
tax credit. In particular, the import surcharge increases receipts and

III -23
thereby makes fiscal policy appear more restrictive even though it may
have some positive effect on domestic production.
The end-of-November Treasury balance, $4.3 billion, was less
than estimated in the last Greenbook largely because the market borrowing
expected in late November was not undertaken until December 1. In that
transaction, the Treasury issued $2.5 billion in tax anticipation bills,
maturing in April. The Treasury has announced another auction of $2.0
billion of June tax anticipation bills, payable on December 13. With
no further borrowing in December, aside from additions to weekly bill
auctions through December 16, the end-of-December cash balance is now
expected to be about $8.5 billion--a relatively high level for this time
of year. This high balance is partly attributable to the recent acqui-
sition of additional special issues by foreign central banks. If this
balance is attained, the Treasury probably would not need additional
cash financing until February, assuming no significant inflow of dollars
from abroad.

THE ECONOMIC PICTURE IN DETAIL
International Developments
Foreign exchange markets. Major foreign currencies firmed
sharply against the dollar following the introduction of the Reuss-
Javits bill on November 18, and again following Secretary Connally's
reported expression at the G-10 meetings of a U.S. willingness to
consider a gold price increase as part of a multilateral settlement
of international economic issues. Many exchange market participants,
believing that a supposed U.S. intransigence on the gold price question
was the major obstacle to an agreement on new parities, interpreted
these two developments as greatly enhancing the prospects for a quick
parity realignment in which most currencies would appreciate further
against the dollar.
As a result of this change in expectations, demand for all
major foreign currencies increased, with resulting increases in
exchange rates and/or foreign central bank intervention. For one
group of countries -- Germany, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Belgium
and Italy -- the excess demand for their currencies was reflected in
sizable increases in their exchange rates vis-a-vis the dollar, as
the respective central banks refrained from market intervention. For
other group of currencies, notably those of France, the U.K., Canada
and Japan, the excess demands were absorbed by central bank intervention,
and exchange rates for the first three of those currencies showed

IV -2
relatively small changes. Reserve gains by major foreign central
banks (as measured by the U.S. official settlements balance) amounted
to roughly $2 billion in the two weeks ended December 8, virtually all
of which was accounted for by the latter group of countries.
(This marked the first period since the Canadian dollar was
floated in June 1970 that the Bank of Canada had intervened to hold
the rate rather than simply to moderate its fluctuations. On December 6,
the day of the meeting of Prime Minister Trudeau and President Nixon,

In addition to purchasing substantial amounts of dollars,
the Bank of France greatly broadened its exchange controls on
December 3 in its efforts to prevent an appreciation of the franc.
The new regulations were intended to discourage inflows this week
by blocking the conversion of non-resident franc balances after
December 10, allowing their use thereafter only for payments to
French residents. The Bank of Italy announced a little later that
it was prohibiting "speculative" purchases or sales of lire by non-
residents, and Italian banks were given the authority to determine
which transactions were or were not "speculative in character.
Exchange market conditions in the period since December 1
have been characterized as "hectic" by some market sources, with
large movements in rates, and widening bid-offer spreads. The new
French and Italian regulations, particularly the former, are reportedly
causing great confusion and dismay among exchange traders, with the
result that some New York banks are refusing to deal in French francs.
In official transactios, the System continued, from time to
time, and at the request of the Belgian National Bank, to purchase
Belgian francs for the purpose of effecting swap repayments. Such
repayments amounted to $25 million equivalent between November 10
and December 9, reducing outstanding System Belgian franc commitments
to $535 million equivalent.

Euro-dollar rates. As shown in the table below, Euro-dollar
rates, which had dropped off sharply during October from the levels
reached in August and September, turned upward during November and
early December as uncertainty over the exchange value of the dollar
again led market participants to borrow Euro-dollars for conversion
into foreign currencies and to substitute foreign currency assets for
Euro-dollar deposits. The spread between U.S. money market rates and
Euro-dollar rates also widened as it did in previous periods of
exchange market uncertainty. In addition, year-end demands for
funds by U.S. firms,required to offset capital outflows earlier in
the year, may be somewhat larger than usual and may have contributed
to the firmness in rates in early December.

Overnight Euro-dollars were more expensive than Federal
funds during November, but partial data indicate that U.S. banks'
daily average liabilities to branches showed no great change from
October.
U.S. balance of payments. The U.S. balance of payments in
November registered large deficits reflecting both the persistent
weaknesses in trade and other normal transactions and a new swelling
of outflows influenced by expectations that further substantial
revaluations of some currencies would occur fairly soon. On the
official settlements basis the deficit in November probably approached
$2 billion, up from $1.2 billion in October.
The month-to-month worsening appears to have been reflected
mainly in a turnaround in liabilities to foreign commercial banks
from a small increase in such liabilities in October to a sizable
reduction in November. Much of this swing was in liabilities to
banks other than American foreign branches. Also, bank-reported
claims on foreigners were reduced substantially in October but
weekly data suggest they increased somewhat in November. Data for
transactions in U.S. and foreign securities in November are not yet
available; in October the net balance for such transactions was probably
a small plus, but this could have shifted to a negative amount in
November.

IV -6
A preliminary set of third-quarter balance-of-payments
accounts is summarized below. More details are given on page
I-T-3. Apparently the improvement in the trade balance in the third
quarter (though it remained in heavy deficit) was matched by a reduc-
tion in the surplus in the services account. This reflected a decline
in income receipts from U.S. direct foreign investments -- which had
been temporarily inflated in the second quarter -- and larger income
payments to foreigners on their assets in the United States.
There was little change in net flows of long-term private
capital in the third quarter from the high levels of the first two
quarters of the year; for the first nine months the net outflow was
$3 billion higher than in the like period of 1970. However, only
about $650 million of this change was associated with U.S. direct
investments, and since the OFDI controls are somewhat easier than
in 1970 there seems to be no need for an extraordinary effort at
year-end to windowdress to meet the regulatory limits. Another large
year-to-year change was a sharp shift for foreign direct investments
in the United States, from a large inflow in 1970 (though this partly
involved the use of funds obtained from U.S. sources) to a net with-
drawal of funds this year, especially in the third quarter. Long-
term claims on foreigners reported by U.S. banks increased by $650
million in the first nine months of this year, a net swing of nearly
$800 million from last year.

As expected, much of the deterioration in the accounts in
the third quarter remains unexplained and is reflected in an errors
and omissions item of $5.2 billion. For the first nine months of the
year these unexplained net payments were nearly $8 billion larger than
"normal." Not only these abnormal errors and omissions but also some
of the recorded outflow, as well as some of the worsening of the current
account, was probably related to reactions to expectations of changes
in exchange rates.
U.S. foreign trade. Dock strikes were the dominant factor
in the wide fluctuation of U.S. exports, imports and the trade balance
in September and October. In September a moderate trade surplus was
recorded as exporters accelerated shipments in advance of the long-
shoremen's strike at East and Gulf Coast ports that began on October 1.
The continued shutdown at West Coast ports -- which handle more
imports than exports -- also raised exports relative to imports.
In October a huge trade deficit was recorded as exports fell
sharply from the strike-inflated September level. The level of exports
in October was also adversely affected by the domestic coal strike
which began in October and ended in mid-November. The drop in imports
in October was much less pronounced, reflecting the end, at least
temporarily, of the strike at West Coast ports through a Taft-Hartley
injunction.

IV -9
For the two months of September-October the trade balance
was a deficit of $4-1/2 billion at an annual rate (balance-of-payments
basis), about the same as the average rate of deficit in the five
months of April through August. For January-October the trade balance
was a deficit of $2-1/2 billion at an annual rate, compared with a
surplus of $2-1/2 billion in the corresponding period of 1970 -- an
adverse swing of $5 billion in our trade position within a year.
The distortion of trade movements by the dock strikes in
recent months has obscured any quantification of the effect of the
import surcharge and changes in parities on our trade position. These
distortions are likely to persist through the remaining months of this
year and probably into the early part of next year despite the invoking of
the Taft-Hartley Act to reopen the East and Gulf Coast ports on November 26.
From data on Bureau of Customs collections, it is evident
that the surcharge was still not in full effect in October. Exempt
from the surcharge were goods in transit on August 15 (the date on
which the surcharge was imposed) which were still entering the
United States in the first part of October and goods unloaded from
ships caught by the West Coast dock strike which had begun in July.
There have been reports that U.S. importers and retailers who did
have to pay the surcharge in September and October were not passing
it on to consumers. This absorption of the surcharge was attributed
to: (1) the possibility or hope that the import surcharge was very

IV -10
temporary and would soon be lifted, and (2) high profit margins on
imported goods; whether the profit margins have in fact been
exceptionally high is a point on which information is scanty.
The level of foreign orders for U.S. machinery in September
and October was moderately higher than the average level in the April-
August period and was about back to the higher average value of the
first quarter. Such an increase might possibly be a first indication
of some reaction to exchange rate changes since August 15.

IV -11
Prices and wages in major industrial countries. Despite
the weakening of aggregate demand in a number of major foreign economies,
only limited progress has been achieved thus far in reducing the rates
of price and wage advances. The increases in wholesale prices and wages
have moderated somewhat in recent months in Germany and the United
Kingdom. Japanese wholesale prices were virtually level from April
to August and declined in September and October. In Canada -- where
economic activity is recovering but unemployment remains high -- price
advances since the beginning of the year have been accelerating, partly
reflecting the termination of voluntary price guidelines at the end of
1970.

For most countries, the pace of inflation has remained high
in recent months, and prices continue to rise faster than on the average
in the late 1960's. Checking inflation, therefore, remains a major
objective for most countries. In Germany, this objective has led to
a hesitancy to adopt more than mildly stimulative economic policies to
counter the emergence of a slowdown in economic activity. In recent
months, however, the United Kingdom and Italy -- both facing weaknesses
in various sectors of economic activity -- and Canada, experiencing a
continuing high rate of unemployment, have adopted active expansionary
demand management policies, despite their not having curbed satis-
factorily the inflationary pressures.

Several temporary conditions are helping to reduce somewhat
the rate of price advances in some countries. Direct price restraint
programs are currently in effect in the United Kingdom and France.
The decline of world commodity prices is acting as a price stabilizer.
Finally, the currency appreciations in Germany, Japan, the Netherlands,
and Belgium also should help to keep down the rate of advance in prices
of imported and exportable goods in these countries.
To types of developments may be moderating the rapid increases
of wages, which until recently have been accelerating and which have
been one of the underlying causes of the high rates of inflation.
First, although none of the major countries has a formal wage policy
in effect, the increase in unemployment in a number of countries now
appears to be restraining pay demands. Second, the price restraint
policies in operation in some countries and a profit squeeze also may
be stiffening employers' resistance to inflationary wage demands. To
the extent that these influences do lower the rate of wage increases,
the prospects of braking the wage-price spiral, and subsequently price
inflation itself, will be improved.
Following a sharp rise in prices in Germany during the first
half of 1971, inflationary pressures appear to be receding, partly
reflecting the reduced economic buoyancy. In October, industrial
producer prices were virtually at the same level as in July. Recent
rates of increase of consumer prices, particularly if food is excluded,
show much less moderation. Nevertheless, industrial producer prices

IV -14
in August-October were still 4.5 per cent above the same period last
year, while on the same year-over-year comparison retail prices had
advanced by somewhat less than 6 per cent. The Government is continuing
to accord priority to curbing inflation, even if this means extending
the duration of the period of slow real growth.
Some deceleration of German earnings increases is noticeable
in recent months. This is partly attributable to a reduction in over-
time. But wage settlements also are lower than earlier. In June, a
leading settlement in the chemical industry involved a 7 per cent wage
rate increase, a substantial reduction from the 13 per cent average
rise in wage rates in manufacturing recorded in 1970. (The 1970 wage
settlements, however, were considered catchups from the relatively
more moderate 1968/1969 settlements.) The current metal workers strike,
which began November 23 and which is affecting an increasing proportion
of German production partly because of lockouts, is becoming a major
test of whether the recent slowing of wage increases will be maintained.
The workers had demanded an 11 per cent wage increase, which was
countered by a 4-1/2 per cent offer by the employers. A state mediation
commission recommended 7-1/2 per cent, which the unions accepted but
the employers rejected. The unions then reverted to their original
11 per cent demand, and an arbitration council has been established.
In the United Kingdom. the pace of inflation also appears
to have been abating. From July to October, wholesale prices for
manufactured goods increased by 0.5 per cent (not annual rate), while

IV -15
consumer prices advanced by 0.8 per cent (also not annual rate). Even
allowing for favorable seasonal influences on prices during these months,
the rate of recent price increases has been substantially reduced from
the exceedingly rapid rise in prices experienced earlier in the year.
The break in the rate of price increases since mid-year was
aided by a reduction in sales taxes in mid-July and by the announcement
of the Confederation of British Industry's (CBI) price restraint agree-
ment. This voluntary arrangement limits price increases by large firms
to 5 per cent for 12 months. It appears to be working satisfactorily.
An additional factor helping to slow the pace of British
price advance is some relaxation in cost pressures. The rate of increase
of weekly wage earnings has declined since early this year. This reflects,
in part, the impact of the British economic stagnation -- i.e., fewer
hours worked and less wage drift.
Continued moderate deceleration of price and wage inflation
over the next several months seems a reasonable prospect. The CBI
initiative, the likely further reduction in indirect taxes in the near
future, and the sobering effect on union militancy of a 4 per cent
unemployment rate -- 1 million workers -- are likely to act as brakes
on inflation. Several major wage negotiations are now in progress,
and the results soon will reveal whether the recent moderation of wage
increases will continue. The likely improvement in productivity as
economic recovery gains momentum also will help to relieve cost pressures.
The comprehensive system of price controls in France has not
prevented a rapid rise in prices this year. In the three months

IV -16
August-October wholesale prices of intermediate goods were more than
5 per cent above a year earlier, while retail prices in the same
three months showed a year-over-year increase of nearly 6 per cent.
Although economic activity in France has continued to
advance this year, aggregate demand is not excessive. Cost-push
pressures -- mainly increased wages and, to a lesser extent, rises
in import prices of petroleum and manufactured goods and increases in
prices of domestic agricultural products -- have been the principal
sources fueling inflation.
In September, a new anti-inflationary program was launched.
The Government signed a series of agreements with large businesses
designed to hold price increases on manufactured goods to 1-1/2 per cent
through March 1972. The 0.6 per cent rise in the October retail price
index, however, has given this program an inauspicious start.
Most wage contracts now contain some form of escalator clause,
and the minimum wage is rigidly tied to changes in the consumer price
index. The October price rise will trigger a 2.3 per cent increase in
the minimum wage, and this, in turn, will have an effect on the entire
pattern of wage rates.
In Italy, the rate of wage increases continues to be high,
and the rise in prices, although somewhat slower than in 1970, is fairly
rapid. Wholesale prices of nonagricultural products in the three months
June-August were nearly 4 per cent above the year-earlier level, and
consumer prices in the three months August-October recorded close to
a 5 per cent year-over-year increase.

IV -17
As the Italian economy has been operating far below capacity,
the price rises this year (as well as most of last year's) are entirely
of a cost-push nature. Labor costs continue to rise rapidly: in both
the second and third quarters, hourly wage rates in manufacturing were
13.5 per cent above a year earlier. With productivity gains much lower
than the rate of wage increases, it is questionable how much longer part
of such wage increases can be absorbed by producers' profit margins.
The pace of inflation has not inhibited the authorities from
adopting reflationary measures. In fact, since part of the inflation
is caused by increasing unit costs associated with declining or constant
output, increasing the rate of economic activity may reduce cost pressures.
On November 12, the Government announced its decision to accelerate
public spending on housing, hospitals and highways by pumping about
1.2 trillion lire ($2 billion) -- 2 per cent of Italian GNP -- into
the economy in the next few months.
In Belgium, consumer price rises have accelerated in recent
months, as the pressure of rising wage rates has remained strong. In
the August-October period, retail prices were about 5 per cent above
the same months a year earlier.
To delay and minimize the immediate impact on consumer prices
of the shift from the turnover tax to the TVA last January 1, the
Government used its powers to prevent, for up to five months, part or
all of any retail price increase. The speeding-up of the rate of
increase in consumer prices after mid-year reflects to a major extent

IV -18
the expiration of the five-month maximum delay period. But since the
shift to the TVA is estimated to have had the "mechanical" effect of
raising consumer prices by about 2 per cent, the Belgian authorities
regard the year-to-year rise as satisfactory under the circumstances.
Prices and wages in the Netherlands are continuing to advance
at rapid rates. Consumer prices in August-October were nearly 8 per cent
above the corresponding months a year earlier. Living costs will have
risen by some 20 per cent in the past three years; this compares with a
13 per cent rise recorded in the previous three years.
The recent high rates of price advances, with retail prices
jumping nearly 1 per cent in October alone, partly reflected the lifting
of the wage moderation policy and the termination of price restrictions
in July. Since the Netherlands still has high rates of capacity utiliza-
tion, the inflation cannot be attributed solely to cost-push factors.
However, the high rate of wage increases remains a major cause of the
inflation. In 1970, wages advanced at a 12-1/2 per cent clip, and
this year, despite statutory limitations for part of the year, the
rise is estimated to approach 14 per cent. The outlook for the rate
of wage increases for 1972 is hardly any better.
Inflation does not appear to be a serious problem for Japan
at present. Wholesale prices, in fact, have declined in recent months,
partly reflecting a "bearish" commodity market associated with the
continuing slowdown of Japanese economic activity but partly resulting
from declining import prices. The rise of consumer prices, on the

IV -19
other hand, has not yet slowed. In the three months August-October,
retail prices were 7 per cent above the year earlier level, and the
rise was accelerating until October. However, given the lagged
effect of movements of wholesale prices on retail prices, the recent
decline in wholesale prices suggests an easing of the rise of prices at
the retail level in the months ahead.
Average monthly earnings in manufacturing in Japan continued
to advance rapidly, but at a slightly lower rate than last year. In
view of the intractability of the economic slowdown in Japan, the rate
of increase in earnings is likely to be reduced in the near future.
Historically, there appear to exist unusually close links between the
rate of increase in earnings (especially year-end bonuses) and business
conditions in Japanese industry.
Canada faces the problem of containing prices and wages without
sacrificing the expansion of output and employment. Wholesale prices of
manufactured goods and consumer prices began to accelerate again at the
turn of the year, following the termination of the 1970 voluntary
price restraint program. In the third quarter, wholesale prices were
nearly 5 per cent above the previous year's level, while consumer prices
in the three months August-October had advanced more than 3 per cent
over a year earlier. In contrast to the case of Japan, the lag in
effects of movements of wholesale prices on retail prices suggests
that consumer prices may increase more rapidly in the months ahead.
Such high rates of price rises, at a time when unemployment
at 7 per cent is at a ten-year high and when aggregate demand in Canada

IV -20
is far from excessive, indicate that Canada is experiencing cost-push
inflation. The average base wage rate negotiated under collective
agreements shows an 8.6 per cent year-over-year increase for the third
quarter. However, the present phase of above-average productivity
growth associated with an early stage of economic recovery (a phase
that is expected to continue well into 1972) may help to keep down
somewhat the rise of unit labor costs.

APPENDIX A WILL APPEAR IN THE SUPPLEMENT

APPENDIX B: THE FLOATING PRIME RATE*
In response to an informal survey, the Reserve Banks have
indicated that to their knowledge only four commercial banks have thus
far publicly adopted a floating prime rate. Two other commercial banks
have apparently abandoned the prime rate convention altogether, intending
to negotiate rates separately with each customer. Other banks have
stated that they are interested in the floating rate concept but do not
believe that a suitable rate setting mechanism has been devised as yet.
The rate-setting procedures adopted by banks that have shifted
to a floating rate differ to some degree. First National City Bank has
tied its prime rate to a level 50 basis points above the rate charged
borrowers on 90 day commercial paper and has indicated that, when necessary,
it will change the prime rate weekly in one eighth point intervals, using
either a weekly average or rates established on the last days of the
preceding week as the base rate. Irving Trust Co. has tied its rate 50
basis points above the dealer rate offered buyers of commercial paper,
with changes to be made in quarter point intervals on the basis of
fluctuations in the weekly average of the base rate. Michigan Bank
NA,in Detroit, has adopted an index of the 90 day commercial paper rate
and the rate on 360 day negotiable CD's. The prime rate determined in
this way will be limited to borrowers in the banks own market area. The
final details of the policy of the First National Bank of Boston,have
not been worked out yet, but the bank has indicated that it intends to
use a broader range of money market variables than those adopted by the
other banks, and will also give considerationto its own portfolio position
in setting its rate. This bank plans to change its rates on a monthly
basis in one eighth point intervals but does not intend to annouce its
actions.
The prime rate has progressively become a more flexible rate
in recent years, changing more frequently and in smaller intervals to
alterations in money market conditions as banks have responded to the
competitive challenge offered by the commercial paper market and have
placed greater reliance on large CD's and non deposit funds, the cost of
which tend to move sensitively with money market conditions. In some
respects, therefore, the significance of the new floating rate policy
would appear to be more political than economic. That is to say, the
newly developed mechanism may bring about a slight speed up in the

reaction of banks to changing market rates and may result in changes
in the prime rate of smaller size, but the range of variation in this
rate over the cycle will probably not be widened significantly by the
mechanism. A device which imparts a more mechanical, non-administered
appearance to a prime rate change, however, may reduce public objection
to a possible hike in this rate at some future time.

APPENDIX C: A SURVEY OF THE IMPACT OF FLOATING EXCHANGE RATES ON
INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND FINANCE*
Summary
As a result of the mid-August suspension of gold convertibility
by the United States, since August 23 exchange rates have been allowed to
float -- subject to varying degrees of official control -- in all of the
European Group of Ten countries, except the French franc rate for trade
transactions. The Japanese yen began to float on August 28. The German
and Dutch currencies had, of course, been floating since May 10, and the
Canadian dollar since June 1, 1970. Moreover, in several countries the
authorities have acted with both direct and indirect measures to limit
the movement of the exchange rate away from the official parity. Never-
theless, the current situation constitutes a radical departure from the
past because floating rates are at present widespread and because great
uncertainty prevails, here and abroad, as to the levels of exchange rates
in the near future.
A survey of recent exchange market and trade developments was
requested by the Department of State from the American Embassies in nine
countries 1/ and was carried out in late October. It indicates that, in
the limited period of time since mid-August, the new exchange rate situa-
tion has so far had no readily apparent effect on the volume of foreign
trade, with the important exception of export sales involving credits of
relatively long maturity. (The survey did not cover effects on trade of
changes in exchange rate levels, i.e., of the resulting changes in
relative prices.) The survey results suggest that, on the basis of ex-
change market activity, capital movements have not been hindered by the
floating rates per se, except possibly in Japan. On the other hand,
despite the great uncertainty about spot exchange rates there has been
no general increase in the use of the forward exchange market. The survey
also covered reactions of the public to the U.S. measures of August 15;
the findings show a general unhappiness but no organized pressure for
retaliatory measures in any of the countries surveyed.

Effects on trade
The results of the survey suggest that increased uncertainties
over exchange rates since August 15 have had no obvious repercussions on
most types of trade transactions. But in most of the countries covered
by the survey, difficulties have been experienced for exports involving
relatively long-term credits, in general those over one year, because the
long payment period increases the exchange risk, and forward cover for
longer periods is unobtainable or very expensive. One way in which the
exporter can avoid an exchange risk is to invoice his shipments in his
own currercy, thus placing the risk on the buyer. According to the survey,
this practice is now widespread, or has recently increased, in Belgium,
France, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland and Japan. In Switzerland,
exports requiring long-term finance came to a halt after mid-August but
now are reviving because buyers have given in and agreed to being billed
in Swiss francs.
Importers' resistance to invoicing in the seller's currency
obliges some exporters to bill in the importer's currency or some third
currency, usually the dollar (although some shifting from the dollar to
sterling was noted in Sweden and Switzerland). In these instances, the
exporter may still avoid an exchange risk by borrowing the invoice currency
from a bank, rather than domestic currency, to finance his sales, and this
practice was specifically reported in Belgium. The exporter may also avoid
an exchange risk by selling his export proceeds forward. But in most coun-
tries, dollars can be sold forward only at substantial discounts from spot
rates, and usually markets do not exist for forwards longer than one year.
The survey reported that forward cover was a problem, of greater or lesser
severity, for exporters in Japan, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, and
Sweden, especially for relatively small firms.
In Japan, long-term export contract negotiations were suspended
after the floating of the yen, but are now being resumed. The exchange
risk problem is being resolved in part by increased invoicing of exports
in yen, which Japanese shipbuilders were already doing before last August.
But activity in the Tokyo forward exchange market has declined drastically,
and the cost of forward cover has risen very sharply. This is creating
difficulties especially for small- and medium-sized exporters. The
Japanese Ministry of Finance is now making dollar deposits with banks to
facilitate their purchases of export bills sold by small- and medium-sized
firms. In Germany, exporters' problems with exchange risks have apparently
been aggravated by the fact that, since the floating of the mark in May,
there has been a decline in the proportion of exports invoiced in marks
(presumably because of importers' resistance).

Effects on exchange markets
The volume of exchange market trading was reduced drastically
in Switzerland, and to a lesser extent in other European countries, in the
first few days after the reopening of the European exchanges on August 23.
The floating of the yen on August 28 caused trading to fall sharply in
Tokyo, where turnover (spot and forward) is still 20-30 per cent below
normal. In Europe, trading volume is still generally smaller than in July
and early August, when speculative activity was intense. But in all the
European countries covered by the survey, trading volume has now returned
to the normal levels (reached in Switzerland in late October), or has risen
above normal (Sweden). The survey did not specifically seek to inquire
about the effects of floating rates on international capital flows. But
the resumption of normal levels of exchange market trading in Europe suggests
that, if capital flows in European countries were initially hindered by the
new exchange rate system, they are no longer hindered. From London it is
reported that the international bond market is operating without any diffi-
culties as a result of floating rates, and that activity in that market has
been more dominated by dollar issues since the float than it was before.
In Switzerland, demand for dollar-denominated Euro-bonds has increased at
the expense of issues denominated in marks. The evidence that capital flows
are now little if any restricted by floating rates should, of course, be
considered in conjunction with the fact that the United Kingdom, France,
Switzerland and Japan have imposed controls since mid-August to discourage
or prevent inflows of short-term capital of one kind or another, to reduce
upward pressure on the exchange rate, and the Netherlands has established
a special exchange market for transactions in guilder-denominated bonds
between residents and nonresidents.
In Japan, the volume of trading in forward exchange has been
reduced by two-thirds or more, which is proportionately a much greater
reduction than that in spot exchange trading. In Europe, exchange markets
do not show any important shifts in the composition of trading between spot
and forward transactions as compared with normal periods in the past. Sweden
was the only country for which the survey reported a definite rise in the
volume of forward transactions; there, forward sales of dollars and forward
purchases of sterling and marks have increased. In Italy there is "some
tendency" for more exporters to cover forward, but for Britain the survey
found no significant increase in the demand for forward cover. The general
situation in European markets remains one in which trading in forwards is
a small part of the total (a figure of 10-15 per cent was reported for
Belgium) and in which importers and exporters typically do not cover for-
ward. Following the floating of the mark and the guilder in May, and
following the reopening of the European exchanges in August, spreads between

C-4
banks' bid and offer rates for foreign currencies generally widened
sharply. Since then, spreads have narrowed again, but they still remain
two or three times greater than normal in Switzerland and four times
larger in France and the Netherlands.
Reactions to U.S. measures
Apart from the controls on capital inflows imposed by Japan,
Switzerland, France, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, the only
significant actions taken specifically in reaction to the U.S. measures
of August 15 were several measures by Japan. As reported above, steps
have been taken to help exports of small- and medium-sized firms. The
Japanese government will pay at least 60 per cent of their normal average
wage to workers temporarily laid off because of the U.S. measures and the
floating of the yen. In addition,three government-affiliated financing
institutions will extend long-term, low-interest loans to export-related
firms, and special loans will be made to enable firms to change their line
of business. Exporters in Britain, Germany, and France are more concerned
about the U.S. investment tax credit than about the import surcharge, while
the opposite was reported for Italy and Japan. Exporters' dissatisfaction
over appreciation of the exchange rate was noted in Germany and Belgium.
Although floating rates have had relatively little injurious effect on
trade, there is a general concern that prolonged uncertainty about exchange
rates could eventually be harmful. In Switzerland, industrialists and
bankers have stated that if progress in eliminating the U.S. surcharge and
the uncertainty over exchange rates were not made by early 1972, pressures
could begin to influence the Swiss government's economic policies.
