THE ECONOMIC PICTURE IN DETAIL
Domestic Nonfinancial Scene
Moderate expansion in output and sluggishness in the labor
market have continued to characterize the economy. The staff is now
estimating that GNP increased $19.5 billion in the fourth quarter.
This is a somewhat smaller gain than expected a month ago, mainly because
of a weaker rise in consumer spending, particularly for nondurable goods.
In December, sales of general merchandise stores apparently declined, on
the basis of weekly data. Unit sales of both domestic-type and imported
autos during the month were down more sharply than expected. The freeze
slowed the pace of price advance appreciably in the fourth quarter, so
that most of the current dollar increase in GNP represented real gains.
Real GNP is now estimated to have increased at an annual rate of 5.7
per cent, well above the third quarter rate.
Industrial production in December is tentatively estimated
to have increased by around 0.8 per cent, the same amount as in November,
with half of the rise resulting from the return to work of striking coal
miners. Output of business equipment apparently continued its recent
recovery. Auto assemblies, however, edged down with a further small
reduction planned for January. Industrial production apparently in-
creased at an annual rate of about 4 per cent from the third quarter to
the fourth. New orders of durable goods rose appreciably in November,
with a sizable increase for capital equipment.

I -2
In December, the unemployment rate edged up to 6.1 per cent
from 6.0 per cent in November, remaining on the plateau prevailing
throughout the year. Nonfarm payroll employment showed little net
increase after allowing for a reduction of the number on strike. Manu-
facturing employment declined, but the workweek increased further.
As anticipated, average hourly earnings for the private non-
farm economy increased significantly in December following the freeze.
Earnings rose very sharply in manufacturing industries as retroactive and
deferred increases became effective. In mining, the new wage contract
in the coal industry was also reflected in a sharp jump in hourly earnings.
Gross national product--outlook. The staff continues to
project a strong expansion in both nominal and real GNP in 1972. For
the year as a whole, nominal GNP is projected to rise by $100 billion,
or 9.5 per cent, from 1971. Real GNP is projected to increase 6 per
cent, double the 1971 advance. Phase II policies are assumed to be
fairly successful, and the rate of price increase is expected to moderate
further after an initial transition period. Both the GNP implicit
deflator and the private fixed weight index in the second half of the
year are projected to be rising at an annual rate under 3 per cent.
The projected pattern of activity is little different from
that of four weeks ago. Except for residential construction activity,
the major demand sectors are generally expected to be more expansive
during 1972 than in 1971. Consumer spending is expected to increase
substantially, although less than in our previous projection.

Business spending for fixed capital is expected to show
increasing strength as the year progresses. The projected 9-1/2 per cent
rise for the year as a whole is roughly in line with findings of recent
surveys of intentions. Such spending is expected to respond favorably to
developing strength in other sectors, an improved climate of expectations,
and, to some extent, the stimulus of the investment tax credit. With
stock-sales ratios now appreciably improved, and final demands projected
to rise appreciably, inventory investment is expected to make a sub-
stantial contribution to expansion in 1972.
Federal purchases are now expected to rise sizably in the first
quarter, reflecting the recently enacted pay increase. Social security
benefits are assumed to be liberalized in the third quarter, a post-
ponement from the first quarter increase anticipated earlier. Residential
construction activity is projected to edge down in the second half, as
starts recede from current high levels.971-IV

A substantial employment increase is projected over the course
of the year, but the unemployment rate is expected to decline only
gradually to just under 5-1/2 per cent in the fourth quarter. Continued
large increases in the civilian labor force, in part reflecting more
numerous job opportunities, and a sizable rise in productivity--as is
typical of periods of rapid output growth--should work to limit the
decline in unemployment.

I- 7
Industrial production. Industrial production is tentatively
estimated to have increased about .8 per cent further in December, the
same rise as in November. The index was up 3.0 per cent from a year
earlier, but for the year as a whole averaged about .4 per cent below
1970.
Half of the estimated rise in December was attributable to the
post-strike recovery in coal production, and there was a further increase
in output of steel. Manhour data also suggest a further moderate rise
in production of business equipment and some materials, including
lumber, textiles and chemicals. Auto assemblies were at an annual rate
of 8.6 million units, compared with 8.7 in November. January schedules
suggest a drop to an 8.4 million unit rate. Production of most other
consumer goods is now estimated to have changed little in December.
Unit auto sales. Sales of new domestic type autos fell 18
per cent from November to December, to an annual rate of 7.8 million
units after three consecutive record months when sales averaged 9.7
million units. Sales were strongest in the final 10 days of December,
however, at a rate of 8.8 million units. This reversal of the downward
trend of 10-day sales which began after October is attributable to a
sales incentive program at Chevrolet.
December sales of foreign cars were at an annual rate of
1.1 million units, down 25 per cent from November and 20 per cent from
a year ago. The large decline apparently reflected in part shortages
stemming from the dock strikes.
For the year 1971, new auto sales totaled a record 10.2 million
units--8.7 million domestic type and 1.5 million imports.

I- 8
Labor market. Both employment and unemployment changed little
in December. The unemployment rate edged up 0.1 percentage points to
6.1 per cent, seasonally adjusted, with the rates for most groups also
showing little changes. The rate for white workers fell slightly, while
the volatile Negro unemployment rate moved up to 10.3 per cent, about
the rate in early autumn. The civilian labor force increased 175,000,
and was 1.7 million above a year earlier.
Nonfarm payroll employment increased over 120,000 in December,
but after adjustment for workers returning from strikes the level was
up only slightly. The largest increase was in coal mining, where 80,000
strikers returned to work. Manufacturing employment fell by over 50,000,
after increasing 40,000 in November, and was 250,000 below a year
earlier. Among nonmanufacturing activities, employment in December
increased in trade, services and State and local government.
On the stronger side, average weekly hours of factory workers
rose 0.2 hours to 40.3 in December due mainly to increases in the
metals industries.

Earnings. As was expected, the ending of the freeze led to
a sizable jump in hourly earnings as retroactive and deferred increases
became effective. Hourly earnings of production workers on private
nonfarm payrolls increased 3 cents to$3.51 in December after showing
little change during the freeze period. Since a year ago, average
hourly earnings in the nonfarm sector have increased 6.1 per cent; this
compares to a peak year-over-year increase of 6.9 per cent in May. In
manufacturing, average hourly earnings increased 8 cents in December to
$3.68, primarily due to the granting of deferred wage increases. Other
large earnings increases occurred in mining, largely reflecting the
recently signed coal miners contract.and in transportation, where a new
railroad contract took effect.

Retail sales. Sales in December are estimated to have
declined about 1 per cent from November, on the basis of weekly data
through January 1. However, exclusive of automotive and nonconsumer
items, sales are estimated to have changed little. Sales were apparently
down in the general merchandise as well as in the automotive group.
These estimates are more tentative than usual because of the volatility
of sales around Christmas. For the fourth quarter total sales are
estimated to have increased 1.8 per cent, less than in the second and
third quarters. But prices also increased less rapidly in the fourth
than in the preceding quarters.

Consumer credit. The increase in consumer instalment credit
outstanding during November--$15.2 billion seasonally adjusted annual
rate--was the largest on record, exceeding the peak of $12.0 billion
reached in September. Autos accounted for $6 billion of the November
increase; other consumer goods and personal loans accounted for most
of the rest. In the 4-month period since auto sales began to rise and
economic controls were introduced, instalment credit has risen at an
average rate of more than $12.0 billion compared with a rate of $7.3
billion in the four months preceding August.
During 1970 the rise in instalment credit amounted to only
$3.0 billion, in part because the G.M. strike in the fourth quarter led
to a contraction in auto credit. The record rise was $9.0 billion in
1968; in the first 11 months of 1971, the rate of expansion was $7.8
billion.

Manufacturers' orders and shipments. New orders for durable
goods rose 4.3 per cent in November. Even excluding steel and the
volatile defense component, November orders were a substantial 3.6
per cent above October. Capital equipment orders increased, after two
quarters of little improvement, and orders for household durables were
also higher. The October-November average was 0.7 per cent above the
third quarter, despite rather large declines in motor vehicle and
defense orders.

Inventories. Book value of manufacturers' inventories
was unchanged in November, after rising at a $5.7 billion annual rate
in October--somewhat more than had been indicated earlier. The October-
November average increase of $2.7 billion was larger than in the third
quarter, when stocks were being liquidated. Producers in November
continued to reduce materials stocks and to build up stocks of end
products.

Construction and real estate. Seasonally adjusted outlays
for new construction, revised up slightly to a new high for October and

billion. Private construction was unchanged but public construction
declined slightly. The total was 10 per cent above a year earlier, with
most of the rise reflecting higher costs. However, as measured by the
Census index, average costs have remained essentially stable since August.

Phase I consumer price developments. Consumer prices rose
in November at a 2 per cent annual rate, seasonally adjusted, due
mainly to a sharp increase in food prices.
From August to November the rate of price rise slowed to
an annual rate of under 2 per cent, in spite of lags in the index.
Nonfood commodity prices leveled off in this period and service costs
rose at substantially reduced rates. The indexes excluding mortgage
and home financing costs, respectively, show rates of rise under 2
per cent from August to November in contrast to much higher rates
earlier in the year.
According to a BLS rough confidential estimate, items in the
index not exempt from the freeze between August and November rose about
0.5 per cent--0.1 per cent more than the total, or at an annual rate
of about 2 per cent. The exempt items include raw foods, mortgage
rates and taxes, including the auto excise tax. The increase in the
CPI was revised down by 0.1 point in both August and September by the
retroactive repeal of this tax (and the October level of the index was
lowered by 0.2 point from the figure originally published.)

Phase II price developments. The Price Commission has
received about 3000 applications for price increases from the 1500 large
firms required to pre-notify and has approved over 150. According
to confidential information, the approvals average below 3 per cent
when weighted by appropriate sales categories. Many commodity price
increases will not be fully implemented until demand strengthens. A
general rent increase of 2.5 per cent has been authorized with larger
increases for long-term leases.

Major producers cut prices of large volume steel products
by $5 to $8 a ton this past week, effective immediately. The largest
volume item cold-rolled sheet, was cut $5; for this item, the cut
amounts to a substantial portion of 8 per cent rise scheduled for
February 1. Reasons given for the cuts include pressure from auto
makers and foreign competition.
As a result of exchange rate re-alignment, prices of
domestically produced small cars are now very close to those of
major imports--and in some cases lower.

II -1
THE ECONOMIC PICTURE IN DETAIL
Domestic Financial Situation
Interest rates have declined by as much as another half per-
centage point since the last meeting of the Committee, particularly in
short-term markets where the size and character of System operations have
added to reserve availability and led market participants to expect more
aggressive policy stimulation. A special factor contributing to the
sharp drop in short-term rates was the failure of foreign central bank
liquidation of Treasury bills to materialize in the large volume antici-
pated. In corporate and municipal securities markets the holiday lull
in new offerings augmented rate declines, but in the market for longer
maturity Treasury issues, above normal market inventories continued to
inhibit declines.
With other short-term rates declining and business loan demands
still slack, major banks cut the prime rate to 5 per cent. Funds avail-
able to banks and other depositary institutions remained ample, as re-
duced market rates continued to encourage substantial growth of time and
savings deposits. These flows provided strong continuing support for
the mortgage market. Banks also added significantly further to their
holdings of State and local government securities and participated
actively in the heavy December volume of Treasury cash financing
through additions to tax and loan accounts. While both the bank credit
proxy and M2 grew rather rapidly in December, the narrowly defined
money stock showed only a small growth and was close to the average
level in August.

II -2
Outlook: U. S. Government demands for funds, although expected
to remain unseasonally large in the first quarter, are projected to be
less than half their fourth quarter volume. The high year-end Treasury
balance should permit deferral of further Federal borrowing until the
February refinancing. But in that operation the Treasury will need to
raise some new money and may decide to include another advance refunding.
Debt ceiling constraints are likely to limit the amount of new February
cash borrowing and thus to force a sharp run-down in the overall Treasury
balance.
Business financing in the public bond market appears to be
expanding again in January, as large utility and financial corporations
take advantage of reduced interest costs and seasonal reinvestment flows.
However, with private placements rising, stock offerings remaining large,
and scheduled bond financings of industrial corporations relatively
light, the volume of corporate public offerings seems likely to taper
off somewhat as the quarter progresses. Similarly, although security
offerings of State and local governments can be expected to continue on
the high side, fragmentary evidence on the forward calendar suggests
that they too may slacken for a time relative to the fourth quarter.
Weakness in business borrowing at banks appears to be per-
sisting, and recent cuts in the prime rate suggest that bankers see
little immediate prospect for strengthening of such borrowing. While
the economic projection is for more rapid growth in nominal GNP during
the current quarter, inventory expansion is expected to continue moder-
ate and corporate generation of internal funds large. Hence the need
for expanded business borrowing at banks may be quite modest.

II -3
At both bank and nonbank thrift institutions growth of time
and savings deposits other than large CD's seems likely to be sustained
at a fairly high level during the quarter. Although recently there
have been some scattered cuts in rates on deposits at banks, the average
spread of such rates over those on market securities has widened further.
Expansion of private demand deposits at banks also seems likely to pick
up during the quarter, reflecting the expected run-down of Treasury cash
balances, lagged affects of the sustained decline in interest rates
since mid-August, and the anticipated strengthening of economic activity.
Some further decline in long-term rates seems probable because
of the continuing ample availability of funds at financial institutions
and the projected dip in capital market financing. If the Treasury
should include a sizeable advance refunding in the February refinancing,
however, this could tend to brake the extent of such declines. While
any massive foreign central bank liquidation of Treasury bills would
also tend to generate some offsetting upward rate pressures--particu-
larly in the bill market--the odds now seem to favor a more gradual
and smaller foreign liquidation than market participants had anticipated.
A modest increase in short-term rates probably could be largely absorbed
by a narrowing of rate spreads given the positive influences present in
the long-term rate outlook. Any sizeable advance in short-term rates,
however, might well lead to a shift in market expectations and force
increases in long-term rates as well.
Monetary aggregates. Preliminary estimates indicate that M1,
after remaining essentially unchanged in the previous two months, rose
somewhat in December, to about the August level. In contrast, however,

II -4
M2 and M3 increased at a fairly rapid pace, exceeding the expansion in
October and November. The gains in M2 and M3 reflected large inflows
into thrift accounts at commercial banks and savings institutions as
the decline in market interest rates continued to enhance the attractive-
ness of interest-bearing deposits.1/
The adjusted credit proxy continued to rise at a fast pace in
December, with growth exceeding the accelerated November rate. A signi-
ficant component of this increase, in addition to the expansion in con-
sumer time and savings deposits, was a further advance in U. S. Govern-
ment deposits as the Treasury accumulated balances in anticipation of
large redemptions of special issues by foreign central banks following
realignment of exchange rates. As U. S. interest rates declined, banks
increased their issuance of CD's, repaying a large volume of relatively
high cost Eurodollars.
1/ Continued strength in this sector is suggested by partial data for
the current dividend-reinvestment period which indicates that deposit
attrition at nonbank thrift institutions is only a little above the
reduced rate of last year, when the demand for interest bearing
deposits was especially strong.

Bank credit. Total bank credit rose at an annual rate of
about 12 per cent from the end of November to the end of December with
security acquisitions accounting for most of the increase. Bank holdings
of U. S. Treasury securities rose sharply--reflecting participation in
the Treasury's three financing operations during the month. Moreover,
with ample funds available at reduced cost, banks greatly increased
their acquisitions of municipal and other securities. As in November,
growth in total loans (adjusted for loan transfers with affiliates) was
modest.

The December pattern of loan changes in most major categories

II -7
loans continued to expand sharply, and loans to businesses and nonbank
financial institutions remained weak. On the other hand, loans to
foreign banks, which had declined since August, rose throughout the
month and security loans declined somewhat.
The continued weakness in business loans in December was
broadly based by industrial category. However, some strength was
shown at large banks in bankers acceptances and foreign business loans.
It is not entirely clear why foreign loan demand--including the increase
in loans to foreign banks--picked up again in December. However, the
increase probably reflected the relative attractiveness of U. S. interest
rates, together with the easing of the VFCR guidelines in mid-November,
particularly the exemption of direct and indirect export credits from
any limitation.
Short-term markets. Short-term interest rates have declined
substantially since the last Committee meeting, partly in response to
more aggressive System reserve injections. In addition to some outright
purchases of Treasury securities, the System made large amounts of re-
purchase agreements at rates below the usual level, reinforcing antici-
pations of even greater ease in money market conditions. Another factor
influencing Treasury bill yields was the absence of previously antici-
pated heavy foreign liquidation of bills. Not only was the reflow of
dollars smaller than the market had anticipated, but it was accomplished
through foreign central banks' redemption of special issues at the
Treasury rather than through sales of bills.

In this atmosphere, the auction of an additional $2.5 billion
of Treasury tax bills on December 22 did not result in an increase in
bill rates. Indeed, bill rates continued to decline through the week
ending January 5.
Other short-term rates also have declined recently, ranging
from one-quarter to five-eights of a percentage point. In contrast
with the increased volume of financing in the bill sector, short-term
financing by Federal agencies was light in December. While preliminary
figures indicate some increase, after seasonal adjustment, in outstanding
non-bank commercial paper in December, final November data show a $933
million seasonally-adjusted decline, a much sharper decrease than the
preliminary estimates shown in the last Green Book.
In reflection of the marked decline in short-term yields,
together with the continued weakness in loan demand, most large commer-
cial banks reduced their prime rate to 5-1/4 per cent in mid-December
and to 5 per cent in early January, the lowest level in over 6 years.

II -9
Accompanying this reduction, a large West Coast bank and several smaller
banks cut their rates on savings deposits to 4 per cent.
Long-term markets. The interest rate decline since the last
Committee meeting, in general, was less pronounced in long-term markets
than in short-term markets. Yields on long-term Treasury issues re-
mained about unchanged, while yields on intermediate-term Governments
declined somewhat during the past four weeks. The long-term market
was influenced during December by the unusually large overhang of inven-
tories from the November refunding. Dealer stocks were reduced early
in January by System purchases of about $200 million of coupon issues,
but the market was somewhat unsettled by rumors of a Treasury advance
refunding in February which could increase the supply of longer-term
Government securities.
Yields on high-grade, newly-issued corporate bonds declined
about 15 basis points during the first three weeks of December. Al-
though there were no new issues in the public bond market during the
holidays, secondary market activity remained relatively brisk. Dealers
were able to reduce inventories at declining yields given the light
corporate calendar, the sharp decline in short-term rates, and expecta-
tions of further cuts in the discount and prime rates. Yields continued
to drift downward during the first week of the new year in spite of
heavy new issue volume. The staff estimates that public bond offerings,
which dropped to $1.3 billion in December, will return to the $2 billion
level in January. Private placements, which rose throughout 1971, will
be boosted in January by partial takedowns of the debenture portion of
the recently announced AT&T financing.

New stock issues in December at $1.4 billion, were almost
double the total estimated in the last Green Book, as a substantial rise
in stock prices over the month stimulated increased offerings, including
some issues which had been on the calendar since late summer. January
stock volume is expected to be close to the $1 billion level. This
total includes about $300 million of AT&T preferred stock which will
be placed directly with insurance companies and other institutional
investors.
The greatest decline in long-term yields was on State and
local government bonds. The Bond Buyer index dropped over 40 basis
points during December in spite of an unseasonally high level of new
issues. A major factor contributing to this decline apparently was an
accelerated rate of acquisitions by commercial banks. The January and
February calendars appear to be significantly below 1971 levels at this
time. However, if interest rates on municipals decline much further,
the pace of new issues could accelerate.
Mortgage yields also continued to decline in late 1971.
During November the average interest rate on conventional new-home
mortgages in the primary market declined for the second consecutive
month and reached 7.75 per cent, according to the FHA series. Secondary
market yields on Government-underwritten home mortgages drifted down
further during the first half of December and then remained unchanged
over the rest of the month, according to FNMA auction results. In
anticipation of a further rise in mortgage prices, however, mortgage
bankers have reportedly continued to add to their holdings of loans
for which no resale commitments have as yet been obtained.

Federal finance. The Treasury cash balance at the end of
December was at an unusually high $11.3 billion, reflecting in part a
$2.5 billion sale of tax anticipation bills for payment on December 29
(not anticipated in the last Greenbook), undertaken as a precaution in
case of large redemptions of nonmarketable foreign issues. In addition,
corporate tax payments in December were above projected levels and also
about $.5 billion larger than those in September, which are usually
approximately equal.
Redemptions of nonmarketable foreign issues just before and after the
turn of the year totaled about $900 million. If there were no further
such redemptions and no additional Treasury borrowing, the Treasury cash
balance would be expected to drop to about $8. billion by the end of
January because of seasonal cash drains and large refunds of automobile
excise taxes.
Late in January, the Treasury will announce the terms of the
February refunding involving $3.7 billion of publicly-held maturing
securities. In view of the large cash drain that normally occurs in early
February, together with the prospect for additional redemption of special
issues, a cash offering in combination with this refunding appears likely.
Beginning in February, Treasury debt is expected to approach the statutory
ceiling and this will add still another consideration to cash balance
management.
While information on the new budget, to be released late this
month, is not yet available, several changes in estimates have been made

II -14
since the last Greenbook due to intervening developments. Receipts are
estimated lower for the current fiscal year, but the revisions in
expenditure estimates are largely offsetting. The projected deficit for
the current fiscal year has been raised from $28.7 billion to $30.5 billion.
On the receipts side, the import surcharge was removed
effective December 20, 1971, reducing the receipts estimates by about
$1.4 billion for the fiscal year. Also, income assumptions are somewhat
lower than in the last Greenbook. Personal income tax relief provided in
the Revenue Act of 1971 will start to be reflected in cash flows on
January 16, when new withholding schedules become effective. However,
the effect of tax relief will be partly offset by structural reform
designed to increase the portion of taxes captured by withholdings, with
correspondingly lower final payments or higher refunds in subsequent years.
On the outlays side of the budget, the expected timing of
liberalization of social security benefits has been shifted from January
to July 1972, since legislative action has been delayed. On the other
hand, the Federal pay raise, previously projected for July, becomes
effective in January.

Summary and Outlook. In the final weeks of 1971 the
settlement reached for a major revaluation of foreign currencies
against the dollar ended a period of massive outflows of funds from
the United States and set the stage for a turnaround in those flows
and, over time, in the fundamental disequilibrium in U.S. trade and
other international transactions. However, the immediate impact of
the settlement on flows of funds was mild, and signs of underlying
improvement will not be evident for a considerable time. Thus, a
great deal of uncertainty will probably overhang international exchange
and money markets for quite a while.
The lack of substantial reflows of capital to the United States
since December 18 reflects the fact that there remains a yield advantage
on foreign assets as well as a potential for further capital gains since
major currencies have not moved much above their lower limits. The
yield advantage diminished somewhat in early January, however, as
a number of central banks (Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, Belgium
and Finland) reduced their discount rates -- partly in response to the
direction of interest rates here, but such moves were also generally
consistent with domestic objectives.
At the very end of the year there was not the usual year-end
window-dressing inflow to the United States as direct investors appear
to be taking advantage of the 60-day grace period for compliance.

In the months ahead the trade balance will probably continue
to look precarious, apart from any turbulence created by the possible
resumption of dock strikes. The effects of the realignments of
exchange rates would at best be only partially felt within the first
year. In 1972 the adverse cyclical situation will tend to raise
imports and retard the potential rise in exports. The economies of
other industrial countries are likely to be reviving in the course of
the year but a strong growth of demand -- especially in Germany -- is
by no means assured. Under those conditions traders will be more
likely to adjust their prices so as to offset some of the change in
market exchange rates, which has been considerably less so far than
the change from old par values to the new central rates. Thus, the
large basic deficit in the U.S. trade and long-term capital accounts
is likely to continue and to absorb at least part of any reflow of
speculative funds that might be set in motion.
Foreign exchange markets. Exchange markets have been fairly
quiet since the establishment of new central rates and wider margins
of variation subsequent to the Smithsonian meetings of December 17-18.
Major foreign currencies generally moved to near their lower limits,
2-1/4 per cent below the central rates, except for the German mark
and the Dutch guilder, which have held about mid-way between their
central rates and their lower limits.

III -3
The anticipated reflow of funds to the United States has
been small and slow to materialize. The central banks of Britain,
Japan, France, and Canada (which still maintains a floating exchange
rate) sold some $1-1/2 billion dollars in the period December 21-31,
but very little after that as foreign currencies tended to strengthen
after year-end. The Bank of Japan, in fact, purchased some $450 million
on January 6 and 7, after Japanese authorities announced the removal of
their remaining exchange control measures imposed after August 13.
Other countries have also removed most or all of their exchange controls
imposed after August 13, but the interest payment ban on new non-
resident deposits remains in effect in several European countries.
The chief consideration tending to limit the reflow of funds
into dollars appears to be the continuation of covered interest rate
differentials in favor of non-dollar assets. Market interest rates
and central bank discount rates in several major foreign countries have
declined in recent days, but U.S. interest rates have also fallen further.
Also limiting the reflow to the United States is the reported expecta-
tion of some market participants that foreign currencies, now near their
lower limits, may appreciate further in the near future.
The absence of sales of dollars by foreign central banks does
not mean that some reflow of speculative funds is not occurring. The
major European countries and Japan continue to be in basic balance
of payments surplus. In the absence of outflows of speculative funds,
their central banks would probably be accumulating dollars.

The free market gold price has soared since December 20,
reaching a new high of $45.75 at the first London fixing on January 7.
Factors contributing to this rise are the expectation that the
devaluation of the South African rand will reduce that country's need
to sell gold, and some European press speculation that the United States
may seek a larger devaluation of the dollar in the event that trade
negotiations with the EEC, Japan, and Canada do not produce sufficient
concessions on the part of those countries.
Euro-dollar market. Euro-dollar rates moved higher in
December as compared with November in response to year-end pressures
and to renewed speculative activity leading up to the agreement on
realignment of exchange rates. Year-end pressures on the market were
less than normal partly owing to the 60-day extension of OFDI guidelines.
In the first week of January Euro-dollar rates in most maturities
moved down sharply to about their mid-November levels; the gap
between U.S. and Euro-market rates narrowed, but remained quited large.
However, overnight Euro-dollars became increasingly costly
relative to Federal funds, and U.S. banks reduced their gross liabilities
to foreign branches by about $1-1/2 billion from December 1 through
December 29 to a level of less than $1 billion. Net liabilities to
branches plus assets sold subject to Regulation M declined from about
$4 billion in the computation period ended November 24 to about $3.1
billion the period ended December 22. We estimate that the outstanding
level of such positions midway through the current computation period
has declined further to about $2.4 billion.

Short-term interest rates in major industrial countries.
Declining short-term interest rates in most of the major foreign centers
in part reflect efforts to stimulate economic activity. They also
reflect a desire to prevent the recent decline in U.S. rates from further
widening the differentials in favor of foreign rates. However, except
for Canada and Switzerland, short-term rates abroad remain distinctly
above comparable yields in the United States, tending to delay returns
of short-term funds to the United States.
In Germany, the discount rate reduction from 4-1/2 to 4 per-
cent on December 23 was accompanied by a 10 percent reduction in reserve
requirements, against domestic liabilities only, effective January 1.

III -6
The 3-month interbank loan rate is currently 6 percent, down 2 percentage
points from its early-October level. While the avowed purpose of the
latest monetary easing was to encourage capital outflows and forestall
any upward pressure on the market exchange rate of the mark, seasonal
pressures on bank liquidity and the sluggish pace of the economy were
likely contributory factors.
Elsewhere in Europe, discount rate reductions effective
January 6 in Belgium (from 5-1/2 to 5 percent) and the Netherlands
(from 5 to 4-1/2 percent) were probably speeded by the German action.
But the economic slowdown was certainly the major consideration behind
the easing in Belgium, where the National Bank acted even though short-
term market rates had risen somewhat since the last discount rate slash
in September. In Switzerland, the banking system remains extremely
liquid, the 3-month deposit rate has fallen to 1-1/2 percent, and banks
have cut their rates on discounts of first-class commercial paper.
The French call money rate continues at around 5-1/4 percent even
though several easing measures were taken in early December, notably
including substantial cuts in bank reserve requirements averaging about
20 percent.
By mid-December the 90-day local authority rate in Britain
had dropped to 4.7 percent from its March high of 8 percent and a mid-
September level of 5.4 percent. Rates declined under the influence of
speculative inflows from abroad, expectations of a discount rate cut,

III -7
and increased competition in rates on bank loans following reforms
introduced in September.
The Bank of Japan cut its discount rate again on December 29
from 5-1/4 to 4-3/4 percent, the fourth reduction of the year, in
reflection of the sluggish state of the economy. The reduction was
preceded by declines in the call money rate totaling 1-1/4 percentage
points since last August, and was followed by a 1/2-point drop in
commercial bank prime lending rates. Canadian short-term yields, which
had begun moving downward in October, declined further through most
of December. The Canadian Treasury bill rate on January 5 was about
1/2 percentage point under the U.S. bill rate, a spread smaller than
in the past six weeks but about the same as at the end of September.
Chartered banks' secondary reserve ratios were lowered on December 31.
Balance of payments. Although there was some movement of
funds out of foreign currencies into dollars immediately after the
settlement reached on December 18-19, the U.S. official settlements
deficit for the month of December as a whole probably approached $3-1/2
billion. This brought the deficit for the fourth quarter to nearly
$6-1/2 billion, and the deficit for the year was roughly $31 billion.
During the fourth quarter major elements in the balance of
payments remained heavily adverse. As noted below, the trade balance
continued to register large import balances -- though data for December
are not yet available. Export orders weakened in November. Capital

outflows, apart from the more speculative variety, were also con-
tributing substantially to the deficit. Foreign assets reported by
banks increased over $600 million in November, and partial weekly
data indicate a continuation of banking outflows on a substantial
scale through December. Since direct investors were relieved of the
need for year-end window-dressing their outflows of funds in the fourth
quarter were probably much larger than normal. Finally, foreigners
were moderate net sellers of U.S. equity securities in October, and
then apparently stepped up their net liquidation to about $400 million
in November.
In the early part of this year some of the banks and direct
investors who were placing large amounts of funds abroad in 1971 may
be under some pressure from the restraint programs, though these are
now substantially more liberal. If the U.S. economy moves ahead more
strongly than others, however, this, together with the change in
exchange rates, should begin to moderate outflows of U.S. private capital
and attract investment funds from abroad.
U.S. foreign trade. The November trade balance was a deficit
but it was considerably smaller than the record deficit registered in
October, largely reflecting the timing of dock strikes. Assuming that
there was probably also a deficit in December, the 1971 trade balance is
estimated to have seen a deficit of about $2-1/2 billion, balance of
payments basis, a change of $4-1/2 billion from the $2 billion surplus
in 1970.

III -9
The 1971 deficit stemmed from a virtual stagnation in
exports (about 1 percent higher than the 1970 level) while imports
increased by about 15 percent. Increases in exports from 1970 to 1971
in agricultural commodities, commercial aircraft, and automobiles and
parts to Canada were just about offset by declines in shipments of
industrial materials and machinery as foreign economic activity slowed.
The gain in imports in 1971 was spread over all major
categories of goods; the greatest increase was in imports of cars --
especially from Japan.
Trade movements in 1971 were so beset by "special factors" --
domestic strikes, anticipation of controls on U.S. imports, and
possible changes in exchange rates -- that a true reading of our
underlying rade position is difficult to determine. Advanced buying
of foreign goods may have raised imports in the early part of 1971,
but this increase was probably more than offset by smaller arrivals
in the closing months of the year as a result of dock strikes.
Cyclical conditions here and abroad were favorable, on balance,
for U.S. trade in 1971. While exports were limited by the economic
slowdown in foreign industrial countries, continued sluggishness in
the United States dampened imports to an even greater degree. A rough
adjustment of the balance for the effects of domestic strikes and
cyclical conditions would suggest that the trade deficit in 1971 might
have been about $1 billion larger than actually recorded, i.e.,
$3-1/2 billion.

III -10
The outlook for the immediate future continues to be clouded
by the threatened resumption in February of dock strikes at both East
and West Coast ports. In the long run, the recently announced
realignment of exchange rates will arrest the downtrend in our trade
position. Without such a realignment, the trade deficit in 1972 had
been projected to be about $5 billion. With the new rates the deficit
is now estimated to be about $2-1/2 billion -- about the same as last
year.
