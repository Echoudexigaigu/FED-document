Prefatory Note  
 
 
The attached document represents the most  complete and accurate version available 
based on original copies culled from the f iles of the FOMC Secretariat at the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve Syst em.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization proce ss which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain. 
 Please note that some material may have b een redacted from this document if that 
material was received on a confidential ba sis.  Redacted material is indicated by 
occasional gaps in the text or by gray boxe s around non-text content.  All redacted

1  In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic 
format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to rem ove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing). 
 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optical character recognition computer program (OCR) 
first created electronic text from the document im age.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, 
staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.  Pl ease note that the numbers and text in charts and 
tables were not reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff.

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Summary. Recent production and employment data suggest that
the pace of expansion has moderated from the exceptionally rapid advance
indicated for the second quarter--an annual rate of 8.9 per cent for
real GNP. Industrial production is tentatively estimated to have in-
creased only moderately again in July, following larger gains earlier
in the year. Floods in the East contributed to the slower growth in
June and July, but to an unknown extent.
Various signs point to continued underlying strength, however.
Retail sales are estimated on the basis of weekly data to have risen
appreciably in July to a new high, more than recouping the June decline.
Unit sales of domestic-type autos rose sharply to the highest rate this
year. In June manufacturers' new orders for durable goods continued
expansive, with the nondefense capital goods industries continuing to
show an upward trend, and book value of manufacturers' inventories rose
at a substantial rate.
Unemployment in July remained at the reduced 5.5 per cent
rate of June, suggesting that the long-awaited improvements in this
measure may be under way. Nonfarm payroll employment, however, showed
little change after adjustment for strikes from the upward revised
June level. Employment declined in manufacturing, but this may have been
largely attributable to the temporary closing of plants due to the floods.
The factory workweek was unchanged at a relatively high level.
The increase in average hourly earnings in the private nonfarm
sector was moderate in July; the annual rate of increase since
January has been about 4-1/2 per cent. Productivity rose sharply in

I -2
the nonfarm sector in the second quarter, and unit labor costs showed
no increase for the first time in many years.
The better cost performance in the second quarter was accom-
panied by some moderation in prices. The private fixed-weight deflator
rose at a rate of 3.1 per cent, compared with 4.5 per cent in the first
quarter. The increase in the GNP deflator was at an annual rate of
only 2.1 per cent. This relatively low rate reflects both a reduced
pace of price advance for most major goods and services sectors and
also shifts in the composition of demands.
Wholesale prices of industrial commodities rose at an annual
rate of only 2.8 per cent in July, the slowest this year. But prices
of farm products and foods advanced at a rapid pace, with livestock
prices up further following earlier gains, and the over-all wholesale
price index also rose sharply. In June, the consumer price index
increased at an annual rate of 0.7 per cent, and was 2.9 per cent above
a year earlier.
Outlook. The staff continues to project a vigorous expansion
in real GNP for the second half of this year, although not as strong as
the exceptional rise in the second quarter. The current projection
again assumes growth in the monetary aggregates consistent with expan-
sion in M at around a 6 per cent rate.
The projection is little changed from that of four weeks ago,
with all demand sectors--except residential construction--expected to
contribute to the over-all expansion. We still look for an accelerated
rise in real GNP in the fourth quarter, reflecting the stimulus to con-
sumer spending of the 20 per cent increase in social security benefits
which will begin to be paid in early October. We are also assuming

I-3
a more liberal minimum wage measure--a compromise between the House bill
and the much larger Senate measure. And the projection now allows for
general revenue sharing retroactive to January 1, 1972--with payments
beginning in the fourth quarter. We are assuming that the retroactive
feature will act to improve the financial position of State and local
governments rather than to raise State and local purchases appreciably.
The recent improved performance of wage rates, unit costs,
and prices has led the staff to lower somewhat its projection of the
rate of price increase, though the prospect of higher food prices at
retail in the near term will probably keep the rise in the private GNP
fixed-weight price index above the 3.1 per cent annual rate of the
second quarter. The unemployment rate is still projected to average
5.3 per cent in the fourth quarter.

The staff projection for 1973 also is little changed from that of
four weeks ago. Real growth is expected to taper off as the year goes
on, while the rate of price increases accelerates--on our continued
assumption that the control program terminates at the end of next April.
GNP growth is a little less than projected earlier, and takes account
of the less favorable prospects for improvement in net exports reported
in the balance of payments section of this Greenbook. The unemployment
rate is again shown at 5.0 per cent for the final quarter of the year.

Industrial production. Industrial production is tentatively
estimated to have increased moderately further in July, although at
present we have little evidence of any strong advances in output of
final products and materials. Also it is not yet possible to assess
the effects of the flooding caused by hurricane Agnes on industrial
production in late June and early July.
Output of consumer goods in June was 10 per cent above the
1969 peak, a level first reached in April. Available data indicate
little change in July. Auto assemblies, after allowance for the model
changeover period, were at about the June annual rate of 8.5 million
units. In the first two weeks of July, production of household ap-
pliances was down somewhat from the record June rate.
Output of business equipment in June was up about 10 per cent
from its low but still 10 per cent below the 1969 peak; a further gain
in production in July is anticipated. Output of defense equipment has
increased somewhat in recent months and it is estimated that some further
rise occurred in July.
Production of both construction products and materials for
further processing was above the 1969 level in June. Moderate gains
are indicated in July in output of construction products, raw steel,
aluminum, and paperboard. Crude oil production, however, declined
slightly in early July.
Retail sales. Sales in July, according to estimates based
on data for the first four weeks, more than recovered the 1.2 per
cent decline in June, to reach a new high--about 11 per cent above
a year earlier and over 1-1/2 per cent above the second quarter average.

I-8
Outlays in July for general merchandise, apparel, and furniture and
appliances were particularly strong, as were sales of the automotive
group. More complete sample counts have raised earlier estimates of
sales in May and June. May now shows an increase of 2.3 per cent
from April instead of 1.8 per cent,and June shows a decline of 1.2
per cent rather than 1.4 per cent.
Consumer durables. July unit sales of domestic-type autos
were at a 10.0 million annual rate, the strongest this year--up 11 per
cent from June and 20 per cent from a year earlier. July sales were
bolstered by a final 10-day rate of 10.9 million units, 45 per cent above
a year earlier, as several makes, including Chevrolet, ended sales
incentive contests. Dealer inventories at the end of July were
equivalent to only a 46 day supply, 25 per cent below last July.
Preliminary estimates indicate July sales of imported cars
were at a 1.5 million unit rate, up only slightly from a year earlier.
The import share of total sales come to 15 per cent, down from 18 per
cent in July a year ago.
Partially complete data indicate that unit purchases of
major home appliances by retailers were about the same in July as in
June, but 7 per cent below July 1971. The decline from a year earlier
was traceable largely to air conditioner purchases, off 45 per cent, and
in a lesser degree to lagging washer sales. Dishwashers, driers, and
electric ranges were one-fourth above last year's levels, with the
other items steady or up slightly. Retailer purchases of TVs were
7 per cent below June levels but 7 per cent above a year ago; the
situation mainly reflects color TV purchases as monochrome sales were

I-9
about the same as in both periods. Radio purchases were up from both
a month and a year ago.

Consumer credit. Consumer instalment credit outstanding
rose at a $15.9 billion seasonally adjusted annual rate during June.
Although the rate of expansion was somewhat less than the record $17,3
billion increase in May, the average monthly second quarter expansion
of $15.5 billion was by far the largest on record.
Increases in all major types of credit reached new highs
during the quarter. Automobile credit accounted for 38 per cent of
the growth, a slightly larger proportion than in other recent quarters.
The proportion of credit for automotive and nonautomotive consumer
goods combined has increased since late 1971; the proportion of
personal loans--part of which indirectly reflects purchases of goods--
has declined.

Surveys of consumer expectations and intentions. Both the
May-June Conference Board survey and the July Census Bureau survey
present a mixed outlook for consumer spending. Appraisals of the
present economic situation are notably improved in the Conference
Board survey with a sharp decline in unfavorable evaluations of
present business conditions and more favorable appraisals of the job
market. In the Census survey, expectations of a substantial improve-
ment in income are up sharply. Buying plans for homes remain at a
high level in both surveys.
On the unfavorable side, the Conference Board reported
that expectations about future business conditions are off rather
substantially and purchase plans for major appliances are at a low
level. Buying plans for new autos declined 4 percentage points in
the Census survey from the April survey, but were above a year earlier. 1/
The Conference Board suggests that the mixed consumer responses to their
questions are similar to the situation before the 1968 elections and
may reflect political uncertainties.
Cyclical indicators. The Census trend-adjusted composite
index of leading indicators rose 0.5 per cent further in June (p).
The May increase, originally reported at 0.2 per cent, is now shown
as 1.4 per cent, reflecting increases in consumer instalment debt change,
inventory change, and net business formation. In the 20 months since
1/ The Bureau states that unless a quarter-to-quarter change in the
index exceeds 5.6 points it is not statistically significant.

I -12
October 1970, the composite index has shown an uninterrupted rise of
25 per cent, equal to the average of the four previous cyclical re-
coveries.
Leading series increasing in June were the manufacturing
workweek, new orders for durable goods, contracts and orders for
plant and equipment (very slightly), housing permits and common
stock prices. Series declining were unemployment initial claims
(inverted), industrial materials prices, and the ratio of price to
unit labor cost.
The coincident composite rose 0.7 per cent and the lagging
composite rose 0.2 per cent in June (p).

In July, common stock prices and industrial materials prices
declined, and the manufacturing workweek was unchanged.
Inventories. Book value of manufacturers' inventories
rose at an $8.4 billion annual rate in June (p), considerably faster
than the May rate of $4.7 billion. Because there had been a decline
in April, the rate for the second quarter as a whole, was only $4.3
billion, not much above the first quarter. Wholesale trade stocks

I -13
declined in June but also show an increase in accumulation for the
quarter as a whole.
Manufacturers have stopped running down their materials
inventories but have not yet started to rebuild them; inventory
increases continue to be confined to finished goods and work in
process. Among major market groupings, there have been increases
in accumulation for nondefense capital goods and home goods and
apparel, partly offset by decreases for defense goods.

The increase in inventories and a decline in durable goods
shipments in June brought about a slight increase in the inventory-
shipments ratios for total and durable goods manufacturing, but both
were well below 1970 and 1971 levels. The ratio of inventories to
unfilled orders at durable goods manufacturers dropped fairly sharply
in June. This ratio, while still quite high, has nevertheless also
shown a significant cyclical decline. The inventory-sales ratio for
wholesale trade declined slightly.

Manufacturers' orders and shipments. New orders for durable
goods rose 3.8 per cent in June (p). The rise primarily reflected a
larger than usual end-of-fiscal-year increase in defense orders; on
balance, new orders excluding defense were unchanged.
For the second quarter as a whole, orders for the total
and most major groups were substantially above the first quarter;
particular strength was evident in household durables and nondefense
capital goods. Defense orders were a little above the first quarter
rate, and orders for motor vehicles and parts were off slightly.

Construction and real estate. Seasonally adjusted value of
new construction, which was revised upward by 1 per cent for June,
edged to a new high annual rate of $123.9 billion in July. Virtually
all of the gain was the private residential construction. Outlays
for public construction dipped slightly owing to a drop in activity
on Federally-owned projects.
On a year-to-year basis, total outlays in July were up 12
per cent in current dollars, and 8 per cent in real terms, Increases
in construction costs have continued to be limited this year with
July costs only 4 per cent above a year earlier.

Seasonally adjusted private housing starts, which had turned
upward again in May, changed little in June for a second quarter
average annual rate of 2.25 million units. While the second quarter
rate was more than a tenth below the peak reached in the first quarter
of the year, it was the second highest rate for any quarter in the
history of the series. Moreover, it was accompanied by a further
increase in mobile home shipments to an annual rate of 600,000 units.
With building permits and mortgage-commitments continuing
exceptionally high and with mortgage market conditions relatively
easy, only a moderate further drift in housing starts is

I -17
likely in the third quarter. Should such a decline eventuate, it will
probably be more evenly distributed by type of structure than in the
second quarter when multifamily starts accounted for most of the
adjustment.

Labor market. The labor market was generally stable in July
following earlier strengthening. After allowance for increased strike
activity, nonfarm payroll employment was essentially unchanged between
June and July--as were total civilian employment, the labor force, un-
employment and the workweek.
The unemployment rate remained at 5.5 per cent in July
(seasonally adjusted) following a sharp decline in the previous month.
The rate for adult males (25 and over) dropped by 0.3 percentage points
to 3.0 per cent, its lowest level since September 1970. Reflecting
the decline, unemployment among married men and household heads also
fell. However, jobless rates for wage and salary workers, younger
workers and Negroes, increased in July.

The failure of the unemployment rate to rise in July,
following the sharp June decline, suggests that unemployment may now

be trending down from the relatively high plateau it was on for over a
year and a half. There is a possibility, however, that the unemploy-
ment rate might increase if only temporarily in any given month in the
near future. The most likely reason would be resumption of more rapid
labor force growth. Although the total labor force expanded quite rapidly
in the last half of 1971 and early 1972 and is currently up 1.9 million
over the year, it is almost unchanged from the March level.
Growth in nonfarm payroll employment, which had been quite
rapid since the fall of 1971, slowed in the past few months, with the
preliminary estimate for July showing a decline of 80,000. However, in
part the poor showing reflected the effects of recent flooding. (The
June level was revised upward and now shows an increase of 90,000
rather than the no change originally reported.) Employment advances
in services and State and local government in July were more than
offset by declines of nearly 100,000 each in manufacturing and contract
construction (reflecting in part an increase in construction strike
activity of 60,000). Average weekly hours of factory workers remained
at 40.7 hours in July after rising in the previous month. The factory
workweek has increased significantly since the beginning of the year.
Earnings. Average hourly earnings of production workers on
private nonfarm payrolls (adjusted for inter-industry shifts and for
overtime in manufacturing) have been increasing at a relatively slow
pace since January--4.5 per cent annual rate as compared with 6.7 per
cent in the pre-control period of January to August 1971. Preliminary
estimates indicate a moderate rise in July following only a small
advance over the two preceding months.I -20

Slowing in wage raises has been most apparent in the non-
industrial sector, especially services, and in construction. The
reduced pace of increases in construction is apparently related to
activities of the Construction Industry Stabilization Committee.
From November through June, the CISC approved collective bargaining
agreements with a 5.7 per cent average first year increase in wages
and fringe benefits, as compared with an average increase of 13.1 per
cent in the first half of 1971. There is, however, a large backlog of
cases awaiting review by the CISC (over half of the filings since
November have not been disposed of) and these could significantly
raise the construction earnings growth rate. In manufacturing, wages
of rank and file workers have been increasing at slightly less than
the Pay Board guideline of 5.5 per cent, down considerably from the
rate that obtained before the freeze.

Productivity and costs. Productivity rose at a rapid rate in
the second quarter of 1972--6 per cent annual rate in the private
economy and 5 per cent in the nonfarm sector; gains in manufacturing
were somewhat lower. The advances occurred in the context of sharp
increases in both output and manhours. Productivity estimates for
the fourth quarter of 1971 and the first quarter of 1972 were revised
upward significantly, due to upward revisions in real GNP. According
to these new estimates, growth of private output per manhour over the
last three quarters averaged 4.5 per cent (annual rate), considerably
above the long run trend growth rate of about 3 per cent.
Compensation per manhour in the private sector slowed to a
5.6 per cent annual rate of increase in the second quarter, substan-
tially smaller than the first quarter 8.1 per cent rise. The rate of
increase in the nonfarm sector was somewhat smaller. Because of the
large increases in productivity and the relatively small compensation

I -23
increases, unit labor costs were about unchanged in both the total
private and nonfarm sectors--for the first time in a number of years.

Collective bargaining. Wage increases in major collective
bargaining settlements during the first half of 1972 averaged 7.1 per
cent over the life of the contract--down from the 8.1 per cent gain in
1971. The decline reflected in part substantially lower first year
increases, particularly in the construction industry, indicating a
movement away from the recent practice of front-end loading of con-
tracts. In addition, the contracts were of shorter average duration--
about nine months less than previously negotiated in these situations--
indicating efforts to keep contracts somewhat shorter during the
stabilization period while wage rates are under control. Wage and
benefit increases together averaged 7.7 per cent over the life of the
contract compared to 3.7 per cent in 1971.
The new settlements covered 870,000 workers, primarily in
the aerospace, railroad, and construction industries--significantly

I -24
fewer than the 1.3 million covered in the first half of 1971. In
part the smaller number so far this year reflects the fact that the
Pay Board or Construction Industry Stabilization Committee has yet to
act on new settlements affecting a substantial number of workers.

Wholesale prices. Wholesale prices rose at a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 8.6 per cent between June and July, the
largest monthly increase since last August, largely as a result of a
sharp increase in the prices of farm and food products.
Prices of industrial commodities increased at the lowest
rate this year, 2.8 per cent, reflecting in large part reduced rates
of increase for metals, machinery, lumber and wood products, and paper
products.
Consumer nonfood finished goods rose at a rate faster than
recently as higher prices were reported for gasoline, apparel,

I -25
footwear, and furniture. Producer finished goods, however, increased
at a much reduced rate as price increases for machinery and equipment
slowed. Further increases for lumber, electric power, textiles, hides
and skins, and concrete products accounted for most of the increase in
materials--the smallest since last January.

The rate of increase in the index of farm and food products was
the largest in almost one and one-half years as prices rose for fresh
fruits and vegetables, livestock, grains, dairy products, and manufactured
animal feeds. Prices of livestock and meats, which have had a substantial
influence on the rise in the WPI in recent months, may show some decline
for August. From mid-July to early August, prices of livestock and

I -26
meats declined substantially, although some higher prices were noted during
the latter part of the first week of August.
Since mid-July, the Administration has moved to curb price
increases for hides and lumber and wood products by announcing export
controls for cattlehides and reimposing controls on certain firms in
the lumber industry. Export controls on hides probably will have
little influence on prices of shoes during the remainder of this year
as most shoes sold between now and the year-end are either already
produced or in process. On the other hand, the reimposition of controls
on some firms dealing in lumber and wood products resulted in prices
leveling out during the last half of July and could result in some
price cuts this month.
Consumer prices. The consumer price index rose in June
at less than a one per cent annual rate, seasonally adjusted, bringing
the rate of advance for Phase II down to about 3 per cent. The non-food
commodity component was unchanged as significant declines for gasoline
and apparel offset advances for other goods, mainly durables. Food
costs advanced at a 2 per cent rate, seasonally adjusted, and services,
3.7 per cent.
Prices of beef, pork and fresh vegetables rose considerably,
but their effect on food costs was offset in part by declines, parti-
cularly for eggs. The increase in meat prices followed two months of
decline and, according to the Department of Agriculture's chainstore
sample, continued in July.
Other nondurable commodity prices were down as apparel
declined more than seasonally. In addition, a drop in gasoline prices

I -27
reversed part of the May increase. Most durable goods, however, regis-
tered significant advances--houses, used cars, new cars (seasonally
adjusted) and household durables.
Although service costs continued to rise at under a 4 per
cent rate, both the rent and medical care (seasonally adjusted) com-
ponents advanced at rates over 5 per cent, the most rapid since last
June and last August, respectively.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL SITUATION
Market interest rates generally have declined by 10 to 25
basis points since the last Committee meeting. Nonetheless, short-term
rates remain around 100 basis points above the lows reached in the first
quarter, while long-term rates are near the mid-point of the relatively
narrow range in which they have fluctuated since late in the first
quarter.
The general upward adjustment in short-term rates since the
first quarter has reflected the impact of a less expansive monetary
policy and a step-up in business short-term credit demands. Upward
rate pressures in short-markets have been decidedly less acute than
previously anticipated, however, as Treasury borrowing demands were
well below expectations. The modest volume of Federal borrowing in
public markets has reflected higher than expected receipts, lower than
projected expenditures, and sales of special issues to foreign central
banks. Furthermore, in the refunding just completed, the absence of a
short-term issue and the demand for short-term assets from holders of
rights was juxtaposed against a limited supply of bills. As bill rates
declined, investors shifted to other short-term assets, driving their
yields down as well.
In longer-term markets, the relative rate stability in
recent months has been associated with the historically wide rate
spread between short- and long-term rates, and a moderation of corporate
demand on public bond markets--as firms shifted a sizeable part of
their financing to short-term debt markets, private placements, and the

II -2
stock market. The small market demands of the Treasury also contributed
to the rate stability, but anticipation of the large volume of Govern-
ment securities yet to be issued, as well as forecasts of continued
rapid economic expansion and attendant inflationary pressures, have
dampened any tendency for long-rates to decline.
Outlook. In the weeks ahead, the recent decline in short-
term rates is likely to be reversed, but long-term rates may well con-
tinue to fluctuate within a quite narrow range.
Special demands for bills associated with the recent refunding
will soon subside. Also anticipation of fourth quarter Treasury borrow-
ing and continued business borrowing in short-term markets will contribute
to the re-emergence of upward interest rate pressures in the money
market. The upward movement of short-term interest rates may accelerate
in the fourth quarter, when the Treasury is expected to borrow $9
billion, net, and short-term business credit and money demands will
likely be rising further.
Despite the probability of higher short-term market rates,
yields on longer-term securities are likely to continue to fluctuate
in a narrow band until late this year. Corporate bond offerings are
expected to remain relatively modest over the third quarter reflecting
a generation of larger internal funds in the business sector and a
continued emphasis on short-term financing. Later in the year, as
short-term rates rise, some upward pressure on corporate bond rates
probably will develop, and may also extend to the tax-exempt market.
Banks have already begun to moderate their rate of acquisitions, and
ay purchase even smaller amounts of State and local bonds in the

II -3
months ahead. In the mortgage market, the high sustained level of
inflows to mortgage lenders has led to a continued high pace of new
commitments. Even with some increase in short-term rates, therefore,
mortgage rates could remain relatively stable over the remainder of
this year.
Monetary aggregates. After showing only modest expansion
throughout the second quarter, preliminary data indicate that M1
growth accelerated to a 14.7 per cent annual rate in July, the most
rapid pace since May, 1971. The July expansion was concentrated at
the beginning of the month, however, with increases during the first
two weeks of the period totaling almost $5 billion on a seasonally
adjusted basis. While some of this increase may have reflected special
timing and seasonal adjustment problems, the early-month bulge is
largely unexplained. Following the peak in the week ended July 12,
M1 declined by over $1 billion and subsequently leveled off at a
higher level than expected, given the size of the early month bulge.
On balance, therefore, it appears that the demand for money did strengthen
during July as a whole, probably reflecting the continuing rapid growth
in nominal GNP.
In contrast to M1, the expansion in time and savings deposits
other than large negotiable CDs slowed significantly in July to an 8.5
per cent rate, as compared with almost 15 per cent in June. As a
result, M2 grew at an 11.5 per cent rate in July, only marginally
ahead of the June pace. Expansion in the credit proxy, however,
accelerated sharply in July to a 12.5 per cent rate, as U.S. Government

deposits leveled off after declining by about $2 billion in June. In
addition, the expansion in the credit proxy reflected a slight pickup
in CDs which increased by about $1 billion, $200 million more than the
June rise.
Bank credit. Growth in total commercial bank credit (end-
of-month series) rebounded in July to about a 10 per cent annual rate
after showing no change in June. The July increase was concentrated
in the loan component, which expanded at an 18 per cent annual rate,
as consumer and real estate loans continued the very strong increases
evident for the past year, business loans recovered from their surprising
June decline,and loans to nonbank financial institutions advanced sig-
nificantly. Holdings of U.S. Government securities declined during
the month while holdings of other securities showed only a small increase.

The renewed growth in business loans was led, as in earlier
months this year, by strong expansion at weekly reporting banks outside
New York City. In contrast to the earlier periods, however, New York
City banks also figured significantly in the gain, the first time this
has been so since aggregate business loans began to expand more rapidly
early this year. Several New York City banks have indicated that
ordinarily they expect increases in their business loan demand to lag
increases at banks outside New York by roughly six months. If this
general relationship continues to hold, it could be that the lingering
weakness in business loans at these institutions finally has been reversed.
The decline in commercial bank holdings of Government securities
in July clearly reflects in part the unusually light volume of market
financing during the month by the Treasury due to large acquisitions of
dollars from foreign central banks. In recent years, the Treasury
has raised much larger sums in the market during July and this is
reflected in the seasonal adjustment factors for the month. In addition,
however, banks may be generally slowing down their acquisitions of
liquid securities in the face of continuing strength in overall loan
demand.
This latter possibility also is suggested by the small July
increase in holdings of securities other than U.S. Government issues,
which continues a pattern that began to emerge during the second quarter.
In fact, holdings of other securities -- mainly short-term municipals --
declined considerably more than seasonally at weekly reporting banks
outside New York, where loan demand has been consistently strongest.

II -7
In the absence of the sharp upturn that occurred in holdings of such
issues at New York City banks -- reflecting the delivery of a large
volume of short-term New York City notes -- the aggregate figure would
have declined.
Despite reduced acquisitions of securities, overall bank
liquidity remains very high by recent historical standards. At weekly
reporting banks in New York City, the ratio of liquid assets to liabili-
ties, though leveling off in July after spurting sharply upward during
the first half of the year, continues to exceed the earlier historical
peaks reached late in 1967. 1/ The corresponding ratio for weekly
reporting banks outside New York City, where loan demand has been
strongest, has drifted down slightly from the historical peak reached
at the end of the first quarter of this year, but it continues to hover
about the previous highs recorded early in 1971.
Nonbank financial institutions and mortgage markets. Deposit
flows into nonbank thrift institutions during June were stronger than
estimated at the time of the last FOMC meeting. During the recent
mid-year reinvestment period both S&L's and MSB's had a favorable
deposit experience; S&L's received a record $1.2 billion in deposits
during the first 10 days of July, and New York City mutual savings
banks received contraseasonal net inflows during the same period.
Moreover, according to estimates based on sample data, large deposit
inflows continued throughout the rest of July.

Outstanding mortgage commitments at S&L's remained high at
the end of June, and the seasonally adjusted volume of new commitments
was over $4 billion for the fourth consecutive month. In view of this,
S&L's have been using some of their increased funds to build up
liquidity apparently in anticipation of expected takedowns of out-
standing mortgage commitments.
Reflecting increased lending, particularly by S&L's and
commercial banks, growth in residential mortgage debt outstanding
expanded further during the second quarter to a new record seasonally
adjusted annual rate of about $45 billion, according to tentative
estimates. Growth in such debt was also bolstered by greater over-all
support from federal credit agencies, as enlarged net mortgage purchases
by FHLMC plus net extensions of FHLBB advances to S&L's (in contrast
to large first-quarter repayments) more than offset reduced net mortgage

II -9
takings by FNMA and GNMA. With mortgage credit demands also continuing
strong, funds were supplied during the second quarter at little change
in contract rates in the primary home loan market, according to the
FHA series.
In the secondary market for home mortgages, yields have
remained stable during recent weeks. The average yield on forward
commitments to purchase FHA and VA mortgages was 7.63 per cent in the
latest (August 7) FNMA auction--virtually unchanged since the last
FOMC meeting. Offerings to FNMA were again moderate, in view of the
ample supply of funds available from other sources, and the trade
expects yields on home loans to change little over the near term.

Long-term securities. Over the past month interest rates
in private long-term securities markets edged downward. Underwriters
in the corporate market, encouraged by a relatively light calendar
of long-term utility bonds and reports of ample investment flows,
tried consistently to nudge bond prices upward, but with little success.
By the end of the first week in August, the Aaa new-issue index was
7 basis points below its level at the time of the last FOMC meeting;
at these yield levels, new issues were moving slowly.
Tax-exempt yields, reflecting the summer moderation of
municipal credit demands, drifted steadily lower over the period to
a level 12 basis points below that of mid-July. Although bank purchases
of tax-exempt bonds have moderated in recent weeks, fire and casualty
insurance company acquisitions apparently have continued at a sizable
rate. Interest rates on long-term Government securities were virtually
stable over the past month in spite of the new longer-term issues offered
in the Treasury refunding operation announced on July 26, with sub-
scription books closing on August 2. (Treasury financing reviewed in
short-term markets section).
Stock prices and volume on balance remained relatively
unchanged from June to July. The NYSE common stock index of prices
declined one per cent over the month of July, and volume averaged a
moderate 14.6 million shares daily. Early in August, however, stock
prices advanced rather strongly, aparently in response to generally
good corporate profit reports, prospective future increases in profits,
and peace rumors.

Public bond offerings by corporations in July amounted to
almost $1.7 billion; and, based on seasonal patterns, August volume
is expected to be only about $1.4 billion. Scheduled utility offerings
for September are only half of the volume which would normally be filed
for that month at this time, and most underwriters report that few
industrial firms have definite financing plans as yet. However, the
apparently light forward calendar and general expectations of some rise
in interest rates later in the year may induce some firms to accelerate
their long-term financing. Moreover, AT&T is expected to return to the

II -12
market early this fall with a sizable issue, although no decision has
yet been made as to whether the offering will be public or private.
Taking into account these various factors, the staff estimates that
September volume will be about $1.3 billion, but this forecast is subject
to considerable uncertainty.

fl Forecast.
Because of seasonal factors, the monthly volume of private
placements and new stock issues in July and August is below the average
for the first half of the year. However, the switch from debt to equity
financing by utilities--a trend which has been evident for over a
year--appears to be unusually dramatic in September. Public utilities
have already filed $700 million of new stock offerings for that month.
Thus, it appears that the volume of total corporate security issues,
after a distinct dip in the summer months, could return to a $3.5
billion level in September.

II -13
Long-term State and local offerings during the month of July
were $1.7 billion, the smallest volume in eight months and 20 per cent
below the average for the first half of 1972. Revenue bonds have con-
sistently represented over one-third of the volume of tax-exempt securities
this year, and the proportion may increase as industrial pollution control
issues become even more important in the months ahead, in light of
recent clarification by the IRS of their tax-exempt status.
Short-term interest rates. Short-term interest rates have
generally declined since the July 18 FOMC meeting. With money market
conditions remaining generally unchanged and edging up during the most
recent week, the downward pressure on short rates stemmed in part from
a relatively short supply of Treasury issues available in the market,
resulting to some extent from foreign central bank market purchases
during late June and the first half of July. The market's adjustment
to the outlook for a substantially reduced volume of net market borrowing
by the Treasury over the third quarter--reflecting foreign central bank
acquisitions of special Treasury issues and lower Treasury expenditures
so far in the current fiscal year than generally expected--also established
an atmosphere receptive to some downward movement in rates. Against this
background, the absence of a short-term "anchor" issue in the Treasury's
mid-August financing operation placed significant downward pressure on
Treasury bill rates and generated sympathetic movements in private
short-term rates, as investors began switching from their holdings of
"rights" to bills and dealers bid aggressively in bill auctions
particularly for long-term bills. In recent days, however, Treasury

II -14
bill rates have backed up to some extent, but they still remain about
10 basis points below their levels at the time of the July meeting.
Private short-term rates have not as yet responded to these recent
advances in bill rates.

The Treasury's financing operation was highly successful.
Market participants owning more than $19 billion of eligible "rights"
exchanged more than $8 billion of these holdings for new issues--
including $4 billion for a 3-1/2 year note yielding 5.96 per cent,
$3 billion for a 7-year note yielding 6.25 per cent, and $1.1 billion
for a 12-year bond yielding 6.45 per cent. These represent relatively
large exchanges particularly in the two longer term issues even after
allowance is made for the provision that eligible securities maturing

II -15
beyond 1972 could only be exchanged into the longer term issues and that
there was a comparatively large volume of foreign central bank sub-
scriptions for the longer-term issues. In view of the favorable
market reception of the offering, attrition on the August 15 and
September 15 maturity dates will amount to only $600 million and $500
million, respectively. Dealer's net exposure in the financing--that
is, securities acquired in the exchange less volume sold on a when-issued
basis--amounted to about $1.1 billion, but this exposure had been
reduced to about $0.8 billion by August 8.
Preliminary data indicate that nonbank commercial paper
placed through dealers increased (on a seasonally adjusted basis)
about $93 million from the end of June to the end of July, following a
June increase of about $850 million. For the first seven months of the
current year nonbank dealer paper has increased by about $1 billion.
July data for directly-placed paper are not yet available. During June,
directly-placed paper expanded $518 million, raising to about $650
million the increase for the first half of the current year.
Federal finance. The staff estimate of Federal outlays for
fiscal year 1973 has been raised by $4.0 billion to a level of $257.0
billion since the preceding Greenbook. Our estimate of total receipts
remains unchanged at $226 billion so that the projected deficit is now
estimated at $31.0 billion.
Among other things the increased outlay estimate reflects:
(1) the $1.8 billion flood relief program proposed by the President on
July 17th; (2) the assumption that general revenue sharing will be
enacted with benefits retroactive to January 1, 1972 (rather than July 1,

II -16
as previously assumed); and (3) recent House and Senate action that
would increase veteran's benefits. The assumed period of retroactivity
of revenue sharing has been extended because the bill passed by the House
and the one now under consideration by the Senate Finance Committee
follows the Administration recommendation for making benefits retro-
active to January.
A reconciliation of the Administration's official June 5
estimate of fiscal 1973 outlays and the larger current staff estimate
is provided in the following table. Of the $7.0 billion difference
between Staff and Administration estimates, $2.4 billion is due to
legislation enacted after June 5--including the 20 per cent social
security benefit increase--and $4.6 billion is due to our estimate of
pending legislation or revised estimates of uncontrollable items such
as unemployment insurance benefits and interest on the debt.
Our increased spending assumptions, together with recent
revisions in the NIA accounts, have resulted in a sharper shift toward
deficit in the full employment budget estimates for the current half
year. We now expect about a $16.0 billion shift toward deficit from the
first to the second half of calendar 1972 and a further shift of more
than $7.0 billion in the first half of calendar 1973.
The Treasury's end-of-July cash balance was $8.8 billion,
more than three billion higher than estimated by the Staff in the July
Greenbook. Sales of special issues to foreign central banks were $3.0
billion, much greater than expected and, apparently, Federal outlays

were considerably below the Staff projection. The combination of a
high end-of-fiscal-year cash balance and third quarter net cash borrowing
of $4.9 billion--already raised for the most part in the form of special
issues and bills--is expected to cover Treasury cash needs until late
September or early October depending on the timing of the retroactive
payment for general revenue sharing. But net borrowing from the public
in the fourth quarter of the current calendar year is still expected
to be large, probably totaling $9 billion. Market pressures from
refunding operations will be minimal, however, since all but $3.0
billion of the 1972 maturities remaining after August were exchanged
in the recent prerefunding. Maturities not prerefunded may be largely
refinanced with new cash issues rather than by refunding.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
Summary and outlook. After a speculative outburst that
lasted about a month -- from the attack on sterling in mid-June to
the EC finance ministers meeting on July 17-18 and the announcement
on July 19 of the reactivation of System swap operations -- an uneasy
stability returned to foreign exchange markets. The over-all balance
of payments on the official settlements basis was virtually zero in
the two weeks after July 19, as a continuing large deficit on
current account and long-term capital was offset by a rise in lia-
bilities of U.S. banks to their foreign branches. The Bank of Japan
has been the principal official purchaser of dollars in the market;
exchange rates for most other currencies against the dollar
retreated a bit from their ceilings.
Recent inflows of short-term funds to the United States
do not appear to reflect any great resurgence of confidence in the
exchange rate structure. Rather the exchange market appears to be
adjusting from an over-sold position on the dollar, while at the
same time potential speculators and hedgers are being confronted
with a network of barriers constructed by many countries to fence
out unwanted capital inflows. The same barriers probably encourage
Americans holding short-term positions abroad to keep those positions
while awaiting further developments.

III -2
Announcement of a June trade deficit still at a $7 billion
annual rate confirmed the stubbornness of the underlying deficit
in the U.S. balance of payments. Projections reflecting the latest
interagency discussions suggest that for the rest of the year there
may be little if any reduction from the first half $13 billion annual
rate of deficit for current account and long-term capital movements
combined. One of the difficulties that lies ahead is the possibility
of stronger than expected imports of petroleum and food. In addition,
while the potential beneficial effects of devaluation on import
volumes are still well in the future, further price increases for
imports are likely to be experienced in the second half of the year
in consequence both of the devaluation and of rising economic activity
abroad.
In line with earlier projections, merchandise exports are
expected to move up steadily for the rest of the year and through
next year, gradually narrowing the trade deficit, as demand abroad
strengthens. However, projected gains in the service accounts have
been scaled down, mainly reflecting the impact of higher interest
rates on a mounting level of reserve liabilities.
Foreign exchange markets. Following a month of turmoil
surrounding the sterling crisis and its aftermath, exchange markets
have been relatively calm in recent weeks, with the dollar strengthen-
ing against most European currencies. The EC Finance Ministers

III -3
meeting of July 17-13 was concluded with a re-affirmation of
intention to maintain the Smithsonian exchange rates and margins,
and brought to an end the speculation on a joint EC float against
the dollar which had resulted in an inflow of $2.7 billion into EC
and Swiss central bank reserves on the previous Thursday and Friday.
The dollar's recovery was aided by the announcement on
July 19 of the System's intervention in German marks and its re-
activation of the inter-central bank swap network. Actual System
sales of marks were quite small, but seem to have had a very favorable
pyschological effect on market participants.
Major European central banks purchased, net, less than
$20 million in the three weeks from July 19 to August 9, compared
to net purchases totaling about $5 billion from June 23 to July 18.
At present, spot rates for the mark and the guilder are about 3/4
percent below their upper limits, while the Swiss franc is about
1/2 percent below its ceiling. The currencies of France and Belgium
have remained at or close to their ceilings. Three-month forward
rates for all of these currencies are still somewhat above the upper
limits of the spot rates.
The Japanese yen has remained at its upper limit since
the Japanese market was re-opened on June 29. The Bank of Japan
has had to intervene nearly every day since then, and from June 29
to August 9 purchased a total of $1.5 billion. Japan still has a
large basic surplus, quite apart from short-term capital movements.

III -4
Sterling has traded around $2.45 for the past three weeks,
about 6 percent below its former central rate. The Bank of England
intervened in modest amounts on a few days, keeping the rate from
rising above that level. The System continued to purchase sterling,
mainly from the Bank of England, but partly in the market, and from
July 12 to August 9 repaid $565 million equivalent of sterling swap
drawings, bringing the outstanding total down to $98 million equivalent.
The System repaid the remaining $50 million equivalent
of mark swap drawings on July 24, using balances purchased from the
Bundesbank.
While exchange markets were quieter, the gold market
experienced a new burst of speculation early in August, widely
attributed to reports of discussions between French and Italian
authorities regarding the possibility of valuing gold closer to
the market price for purposes of intra-EC reserve settlements.
The London market price hit a peak of $70 on August 3, before
easing back to about $66.
Euro-dollar market. Euro-dollar interest rates advanced
sharply around mid-July when very heavy selling pressure on the
dollar re-emerged for two days just before the EC Finance Ministers
meeting of July 17-18. (See Foreign Exchange Markets). On July 18,
one- and three-month funds, at nearly 6 percent, were close to the
peak levels reached in late June just after sterling's floating.

III -5
Since then, rates in these maturities have eased to about 4-3/4
percent and 5-3/8 percent, respectively. The overnight Euro-dollar
rate remained quite high from mid-July through the end of the month --
exceeding the Federal funds rate on average by over 2-1/2 percent
in the week ended August 2. In recent days the overnight rate has
been around 4-1/4 percent, or about 3/8 percent below the Federal
funds rate. (See table below for details.)

Gross liabilities of U.S. banks to their foreign branches
have continued to exhibit markedchanges from Wednesday to Wednesday
in recent weeks, but partial data indicate that the banks' Euro-
dollar positions subject to Regulation M reserve requirements averaged
about the same in the four-week period ended August 2, as in the
previous four-week computation period.
Balance of payments. As a result of heavy speculative
outflows, added to a large underlying deficit, the official settlements
deficit for the month of July approached $5 billion. This deficit,
concentrated in the first two weeks of the month, was larger than
the $4.4 billion deficit (seasonally adjusted) registered for
the entire first half of 1972. In the latter part of July, foreign
official reserve gains were relatively small and accrued mainly to
Japan. However, part of the dollars purchased were-transferred to
Japanese commercial banks.
A sizable part of the bulge in the official settlements
deficit in the earlier part of July resulted from a reduction of
over $1 billion in liabilities of U.S. branches and agencies of
foreign banks (mainly liabilities to their head offices and
affiliates abroad) and a smaller reduction in liabilities of U.S.
banks to their foreign branches. The sharp turn to a nearly zero
balance on official settlements in the two weeks ended August 2
reflected not only a cessation of speculative outflows, but also
a rise of about $850 million in liabilities to foreign branches of
U.S. banks.

III -7
The ebb and flow of short-term capital accounted for most
of the variation in the official settlements balance between the
first and second quarters. Preliminary and partly estimated data
for the second-quarter balance of payments accounts, summarized in
the following table, illustrate that most of the reduction from the
first-quarter deficit resulted from a turnaround in flows of U.S.
loans and short-term investments abroad by U.S. banks, together with
a larger inflow of private short-term funds, chiefly through
increases in liabilities to commercial banks abroad (including
U.S. bank branches). These flows shifted from a net outflow in the
first quarter of about $1/2 billion to an inflow of over $1-3/4
billion in the second. Most of the quarter to quarter change in
U.S. banks' reported claims on foreigners resulted from a turnaround in
lending to Canada and a more rapid liquidation of credits to Japan.

III -8
An important feature of the first-half balance of payments
was the inflow of foreign private short-term to the United States in
the form of an increase in liabilities to foreign commercial banks
reported by the agencies and branches in this country of foreign
banks. Before seasonal adjustment such liabilities rose by about
$2-1/2 billion. As noted above, over $1 billion of these funds
returned abroad in July. There was only a minor increase of about
$200 million in the first half in liabilities of U.S. banks to their
foreign branches, and the level of these liabilities has not changed
much since March. Of course, any buildup in liabilities to branches
is inhibited by the 20 percent reserve requirement.
In contrast to the shift in short-term capital flows, the
main basic elements of the balance of payments were little changed
from quarter to quarter. The merchandise trade balance worsened
somewhat, as discussed in the following section, while the balance
on services and income improved slightly. Outflows of U.S. private
long-term capital are believed to have increased somewhat, partly
because of larger increase in long-term lending by U.S. banks.
Inflows of foreign private capital classified as "long-term" are
thought to have improved mainly because earlier large net with-
draals of funds from the United States by U.S. affiliates of
Japanese trading companies were no longer occurring. Also, foreign
purchases of the offshore issues of U.S. corporations increased sharply
in June. These favorable shifts more than offset a sharp drop in

III -9
foreign purchases of U.S. corporate stocks, from an inflow of
$680 million in the first quarter to only $175 million in the second.
Indications are that foreigners sold U.S. corporate stocks, on
balance, in July.
U.S. foreign trade. The U.S. trade deficit in June was
only slightly less than in May as exports inched up while imports
were unchanged. For the second quarter the trade deficit was at
an annual rate of $7-3/4 billion (balance of payments basis)
compared with $6-3/4 billion in the first quarter. Although the
trade balance in the second half of the year is expected to show
some improvement, the deficit for the year as a whole is likely
to be well over $6 billion, more than twice as large as the
$2-3/4 billion deficit of 1971.
The greater rise in import prices than in export prices
was a major factor in the larger trade deficit this year. In
January-June of this year import unit-values were about 6 percent
higher than in the first six months of last year; export unit-values
rose by less than 2 percent. Approximately one-half of the increase
in the trade deficit this January-June, compared with the year-
earlier period, was attributable to this differential price movement.
In volume terms, imports rose 10 percent in January-June (after
adjustment for dock-strike effects) compared with the same period last
year, while the volume of exports rose by less than 3 percent over this

III -10
period. The possible effect on import prices of the devaluation
and recent price trends in other countries is discussed on
page III -13.
Both exports and imports over the first six months were
considerably higher in value than last year, but have tended to
stabilize at the high levels reached in February. (January trade
levels were inflated by dock-strike makeups). Imports of finished
goods (apart from automobiles) were very strong in the early months
of the year (partly because of dock-strike makeups) and, after a
dip in April and May, turned up again in June.
With the acceleration in domestic economic activity,
imports of industrial materials -- particularly steel and other
metals -- have begun to increase in recent months. Imports of
foodstuffs (especially meat, fish, and sugar) have also turned up,
reflecting increases in both quantity and price. Imports of fuels
have advanced at an accelerating rate this year.
The upturn in imports of foods and industrial materials in
April and May offset the decline in imports of finished goods (other
than automobile) in those months. In June only a very sharp drop in
imports of cars from Japan and Europe (following heavy imports in
the first five months) kept imports relatively unchanged, as all
other major import groups rose. Sales of European and Japanese cars
rose in June, suggesting that the downturn in June imports may have

III- 11
been an adjustment of inventories following a large buildup earlier
in the year.
The ratios of imports to total domestic expenditures for
corresponding commodity categories of finished goods -- capital
goods, automobiles and other consumer goods -- continued their
upward trend in the first half of the year.
The major source of strength in exports this year has been
the very heavy shipments of agricultural commodities. These result
from larger grain shipments to the USSR, higher prices for soybeans
and cotton, and possibly some foreign buying in anticipation of
shorter supplies in competing agricultural exporting countries --
Australia and Argentina. U.S. exports of agricultrual products in
the first half of this year were running at an annual rate of $8-3/4
billion -- about $1 billion more than in calendar 1971. Exports of
machinery and other nonagricultural commodities, in contrast, have
been flat since January. Since shipments of agricultural commodities
are unlikely to expand much further, and since deliveries of commercial
aircraft (also high in the first half of the year) have also peaked,
increases in total exports in the second half of the year depend on
an acceleration of exports of machinery and industrial materials as
foreign industrial production strengthens.

deficit in the first half of 1971. Exports to Japan were only
moderately higher this year than in the same period of last year,
while imports rose by over 20 percent. Although exports to
Canada have advanced strongly -- being 15 percent higher this
year than in the year-earlier period -- imports increased even
more. Consequently, our trade deficit with that country jumped
to an annual rate of nearly $2-1/2 billion from a $1-3/4 billion
rate in the first six months of 1971. With imports from the
estern European countries up sharply while exports to them were
only slightly higher, our customary trade surplus with these countries
has turned into a deficit this year.

Import prices after the devaluation. Unit value data for
U.S. imports this year do not seem to reflect fully the changes in
exchange rates which have taken place since May 1971. With a
weighted dollar devaluation of approximately 9 per cent vis-à-vis
the industrial countries, and with foreign wholesale prices for
manufactured goods rising at a rate of at least 4 per cent a year,
U.S. import unit values for manufactured goods might have risen
about 14 per cent if the exchange rate changes were reflected fully. 1/
In fact, however, U.S. import unit values for finished
manufactures rose only by 7.0 per cent from the first half of 1971
to the first half of 1972 -- less than corresponding increases of
8.6 and 8.2 per cent in 1970-71 and 1969-70, respectively. A
flattening in the rise of U.S. import prices in the first half of
1972 could have been expected because domestic prices levels here
and abroad have flattened out over the past year. A trend rise in
import prices of 4-5 per cent might be consistent with these domestic
price movements. Consequently, it would seem that no more than
roughly one-third of the 9 per cent devaluation has so far been
reflected in U.S. import unit values.
There are several possible explanations for this. (1)
Foreign exporters may have lowered their local currency prices for

than prices for manufactured goods.

exports, at least temporarily. (2) More important, perhaps, changes
in transaction prices for U.S. imports may be reflected in import
unit values only with a lag. (3) It is possible, also, that there
may have been shifts in the commodity composition of U.S. imports
that would tend to hold down the increase in our unit values. (4)
Finally, foreign exporters may have tried to protect their U.S.
market by raising their prices in the United States less than
elsewhere.
There is some evidence to support the suggestion that
foreign exporters may have absorbed part of the exchange rate change.
Given the slack in many economies, such behavior might be expected.
A comparison of the behavior of export unit values of industrial
countries, in local currencies, with that of wholesale prices of
manufactured goods in those countries, is presented in Table 1. In
2/
each country, except Italy and the United Kingdom 2/, export unit
values fell relative to wholesale prices from February-April 1971
2/ The United Kingdom is the only country in which export unit values
rose faster than wholesale prices. Apparently, exporters increased
their profit margins significantly in spite of the relatively rapid
rate of increase of unit labor costs (reflected in the high rate of
increase of wholesale prices). It is not clear why U.K. exporters
acted so aggressively, given that the volume of their exports has
been declining since end-1971. The sterling exchange rate, vis-à-vis
an average of currencies of other industrial countries, was es-
sentially the same just prior to the latest crisis in mid-June as
it was in May, 1971.111-14

to February-April 1972. 3/ In spite of a general historical tendency
for export unit values to rise more slowly than wholesale prices
in some countries, this comparison does suggest that foreign ex-
porters have tended to absorb part of the revaluation effect in
their profit margins.
However, evidence from the two countries for which actual
export price data are available -- Germany and Japan -- suggests
that the degree of absorption might not have been very great. In
Germany, export prices fluctuated in a very narrow range.from April
1971 to the end of last year, falling slightly relative to wholesale
prices, which levelled-out significantly in this period. Beginning
in January of this year, however, export prices have risen by the
same amount as wholesale prices. Thus, although German exporters
may have absorbed some of the price effects of the mark revaluation
in 1971, they have apparent-ly not done so this year 4/ Export price
3/ April is the latest month for which export unit value data are
generally available.
4/ It is interesting to note that this experience is in marked
contrast to the period following the revaluation of 1961, when
German exporters lowered the DM price of their exports significantly.
The crucial difference between 1961 and 1971 may be that in 1961
Germany revalued alone, whereas last year Germany's competitors --
notably Japan -- also revalued (by even more than Germany, in the
case of Japan). However, in 1969, when Germany again revalued
alone, the DM price of German exports did not fall.

rather than unit values.
data for Japan indicate that exporters in that country have behaved
in a similar fashion. On the whole there does not seem to be
strong evidence that foreign exporters are absorbing much of the
exchange rate effect on U.S. import prices.
Probably more important is the "contract" lag between the
time when order terms, including prices, are set, and the time the
goods are shipped, when they show up in unit value data. Again, if
we look at Germany, where both export price and export unit data areIII-16

available, we find that the two series have diverged since January:
export unit values have tended to fall, but export prices have risen.
The downward trend of export unit values this year may reflect the
fall in export prices in September-November. On this basis, German
export unit values should begin to turn up soon, given the upward
movement of export prices since December. Correspondingly, the
higher dollar prices actually charged on new contracts for U.S.
imports early this year may show up only gradually, over a period
of months, in our statistics. This possibility seems to be sup-
ported by recent U.S. unit value data, which were level from March
through May and then turned up in June.
Shifts in the commodity composition of U.S. imports could
also exert a downward bias on our import unit values. If U.S.
importers shift to cheaper commodities -- as might be expected
following a revaluation -- import unit values would tend to fall.
However, such shifts are not yet apparent. Similarly, although it
is possible that foreign exporters have, in fact, lowered the local-
currency price of their exports to the United States, because of
the size and importance of the U.S. market, while raising their
prices to other markets enough to preserve their profit margins,
this cannot be confirmed on the basis of the import price experience
of other countries.

CONFIDENTIAL (FR) III-18
On the whole, the most plausible explanation of the
failure of U.S. import unit values to rise as much as might be
expected seems to be the lag between contract and delivery times.
As old contracts expire, U.S. import prices may rise further. This
means, in other words, that not all of the oft-cited perverse effect
of the devaluation in raising the value of U.S. imports is behind
us.

APPENDIX A: DEMAND DEPOSIT OWNERSHIP*
The demand deposit ownership survey for the second quarter of
1972 suggests that the slowdown in the seasonally adjusted rate of
growth of the demand deposit component of M1 over that period (line 7
of the table) was concentrated in the holdings of nonfinancial businesses
(line 1b) and consumers (line 1c). It should be noted, however, that
experience with the demand ownership survey is limited, and that
insufficient data exist to evaluate the normal seasonal movement of
specific ownership categories. In addition, ownership data are gross
-- i.e. before deduction of cash items and float (line 5) -- and thus
changes in gross holdings by sector over a quarter can be distorted by
changes in cash items and float.
With these caveats, it appears as if consumers, who had
accounted for a large proportion of the increase in M1 in the second
half of 1970 and the first half of 1971, continued to slow their rate
of increase in money holdings. Nonfinancial businesses, as expected
in a period of rapid growth in economic activity, began to add more
rapidly to their transaction balances in the final months of 1971, but
moderated somewhat their rate of increase in demand balances in the
most recent quarter.
Private foreign (line 1d) and foreign commercial bank and
official balances (line 3) showed only a modest increase in holdings in
the second quarter. In the first quarter of 1972, such balances had
declined sharply.
Financial businesses (line la) continued to reduce their
holdings of money in the second quarter, but not as rapidly as in the
first quarter. All other changes were modest.
