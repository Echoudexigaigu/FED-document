Prefatory Note  
 
 
The attached document represents the most  complete and accurate version available 
based on original copies culled from the f iles of the FOMC Secretariat at the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve Syst em.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization proce ss which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain. 
 Please note that some material may have b een redacted from this document if that 
material was received on a confidential ba sis.  Redacted material is indicated by 
occasional gaps in the text or by gray boxe s around non-text content.  All redacted 
passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable provisions of the Freedom of

1  In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic 
format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to rem ove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing). 
 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optical character recognition computer program (OCR) 
first created electronic text from the document im age.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, 
staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.  Pl ease note that the numbers and text in charts and 
tables were not reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff.

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Expansion in real GNP in the current quarter is projected by
the staff at an annual rate of about 6 per cent, a fairly strong per-
formance, but considerably short of the unusual 9.4 per cent rate of the
second quarter. The slowing of the pace of expansion is evident in
recent monthly data for both production and employment. Industrial
production is tentatively estimated to have increased at an annual
rate of about 6 per cent in August, a rather moderate rise in view of
the quite small advance for June and July that was partly related to
floods in the East. Since April, the index is estimated to have risen
at a rate of less than 4 per cent.
The unemployment rate in August, 5.6 per cent, was essentially
unchanged from the 5.5 per cent rate of June and July, reflecting large
increases in both the labor force and employment. Payroll employment
was up substantially in August after two months of little change, but
the increase since May has been less than half as rapid as in the pre-
ceding eight months.
There are, however, a number of signs of underlying strength
in the economy. Retail sales rose appreciably further in August,
according to the advance report, and were well above the second quarter
monthly average. Sales of new domestic-type autos were close to the
very high July rate and sales of imported cars rose. Manufacturers'
new orders for durable goods, apart from the volatile defense category,
increased somewhat further in July. Both the recent Commerce plant
and equipment survey and the Conference Board survey of manufacturers'

I-2
capital appropriations indicate rising expenditures in the second half
of this year. And business inventories remain generally low relative
to sales.
Recently, wages and prices have risen somewhat more rapidly.
Average hourly earnings in the private nonfarm economy rose at close
to a 5-3/4 per cent annual rate in July and August, after little change
from April to June. The wholesale price index was up sharply in
August, paced by another large rise in prices of farm products and foods.
And industrial price increases were sizable and widespread. In July,
the rise in the consumer price index had accelerated to an annual rate
of 5 per cent, with food prices--especially meats--up sharply.
Outlook. The GNP projection now assumes growth in the mone-
tary aggregates consistent with an annual rate of expansion of 9 per
cent in M1 in the third quarter and 7 per cent in the fourth. For the
year 1973, the earlier assumption of about 6 per cent growth in M1
has not been changed. The staff expects about the same rise in
interest rates by the end of 1973 as under the earlier assumption.
The GNP projections have been shaded up for the fourth
quarter of 1972 and for the year 1973. Consumer spending is expected
to be very strong: retail sales have been rising rapidly and spending
will be bolstered for a time by payment of the 20 per cent increase in
social security benefits beginning early this fall. We still expect
general revenue sharing, retroactive to January 1, 1972, to boost
State and local expenditures starting late this year. Our earlier
expectation of a sustained rise in business spending for fixed capital
has gained support from the recent Commerce and Conference Board surveys.

I-3
With final demands for goods up appreciably, we continue to
project a sizable rise in inventory investment, but this source of
stimulus should level off after the first quarter of next year. Although
projections of residential construction have been raised, such activity
is still expected to slacken as 1973 progresses.
On balance, real GNP is projected to rebound to an 8 per cent
annual rate of increase in the fourth quarter of 1972. Thereafter,
expansion is expected to moderate over the course of 1973 to an average
annual rate of growth of about 4-1/2 per cent in the second half of the
year. Over the same period, unemployment is projected to decline
gradually, falling to a little below 5 per cent.

The staff continues to project an increase in the private
GNP fixed-weight index in the fourth quarter at an annual rate of 3.0
per cent. Recent developments in prices of industrial commodities and
in foods, along with the pickup in the rise in hourly earnings, suggest it
is unlikely that the low second quarter rate can be maintained even though
automobile prices at retail may show a seasonally adjusted decline. For
1973, the staff has raised somewhat the projected increase in the fixed-
weight index, reflecting the stronger expansion in real GNP now projected.
We also assume--as in the recent chart show--termination of the control
program at the end of next April.

Industrial production. Industrial production is tentatively
estimated to have increased around one-half per cent further in August,
to about 114 per cent (1967=100), and was 8 per cent above a year earlier.
Output of consumer goods reached a record level in April and
has changed little since then. In August, auto assemblies, after allow-
ance for the model changeover period, were unchanged from the June rate
of 8.5 million units. In early August, production of most household
appliances was at about the July rate. Production worker manhour data,
however, indicate a further rise in output of furniture. Manhour data
also suggest a gain in production of both business and defense equipment
but a further decline in output of aircraft.
Among materials, output of raw steel rose further and trade
reports suggest some gains in production of nonferrous metals. However,
output of crude oil declined and production of paperboard changed
little.
The slowing down in the rate of increase in total industrial
production from April to July was widespread, with little change in
output of consumer goods, both durable and nondurable, business equipment,
and durable goods materials. However, production of defense equipment,
construction products, and nondurable goods materials, continued to
advance. The rise in the total index from the first to the second
quarter, however, was both large and general, as shown in the table.

Business equipment. The second quarter increase in business
equipment production (gross weighted series) was somewhat larger than
the first quarter annual rate of 9 per cent. These changes differ
from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) plant and equipment expendi-
ture survey, which show a rate of increase in current dollars of 18 per
cent (annual rate) in the first quarter and little change in the
second quarter. However, the increases in the two series are similar
from the fourth quarter of 1971 to the second quarter of 1972 after
allowing for changes in prices.
The difference in the quarterly pattern does not appear
implausible, considering that the two series have different coverage
and timing in the appropriation, production, and expenditure sequence.
One would expect the two series to move roughly together over aQII 1971

longer period, however, as equipment and plant are somewhat complementary,
and the two-quarter performance is consistent with that.
Expansion in output of business equipment showed some tendency
to slacken in June and July from the May level. However, tentative August
figures suggest a renewal of advance, which appears roughly consistent
with BEA's anticipated increase of 4 per cent in plant and equipment
expenditures in the third quarter.
Productivity and labor costs. Industrial productivity increases
have accelerated over the past two months to an annual rate of 4.8 per
cent, with the August figure estimated on the basis of incomplete infor-
mation according to data developed from the Board's production index.
In the second quarter the increase was at a 3.7 per cent rate. In a
related development, average unit labor costs have continued to rise
a little further since the first quarter but are only 2 per cent above
a year earlier.

I -10
Production indicators of inventory change. The new supply of
consumer goods (constant dollar value of production plus constant dollar
net imports) is showing little change so far in the third quarter, after
expanding at an 11 per cent annual rate in the second quarter. With
supply constant and estimated real personal consumption expenditures
rising further, a considerably smaller increase in inventories of
finished consumer goods is thus indicated for the third quarter than
for the second.
Inventories of industrial materials, however, are indicated
to be rising further in the third quarter, continuing the marked expan-
sion under way since last autumn judging by changes in the production
index and foreign trade data in constant dollars.
Retail sales. Retail sales in August rose 1-1/2 per cent,
nearly as much as in July, according to the Census advance estimate.
Most of the August increase was in durable goods, with particularly
strong gains in the automotive and the lumber-hardware-farm equipment
groupings; total sales apart from these two categories were up 0.5 per
cent. Sales of all retail stores in July and August averaged 2.8 per
cent above the second quarter monthly average and the total less the
two groupings was 2.0 per cent higher.
More complete sample counts for the past two months show
the level of sales in July slightly higher and the June dip somewhat
smaller than previously reported.

and a year earlier. Increases were widespread, with all items except
freezers advancing. Air conditioner purchases recovered after falling
off considerably earlier in the summer, partly because of cool weather.
Retailer purchases of TVs--including domestic label imports--were down
slightly from July, but substantially above a year earlier. Radio
purchases, composed almost entirely of imported sets, also were lower
than in July and above a year earlier.

Consumer credit. Net growth in instalment credit outstanding
slowed to a $12.3 billion annual rate (seasonally adjusted) in July, the
second successive month in which the net change fell below the record rate
of increase registered in May. The July increase, although still high
compared to earlier years, was slightly below the average for the pre-
vious 12 months.
Consumers increased their instalment debt by $13 billion
during the year ending July 31, 1972. Commercial banks acquired about
half of this increase, raising their share to 43.1 per cent of total
outstandings. Credit unions also increased their share. Finance com-
panies on the other hand, held a smaller proportion of consumer receivables
at the end of July 1972, than a year earlier.

Fixed capital spending plans. The Commerce Department August
survey of business plans for new plant and equipment expenditures shows
a slight scaling down of the 1972 increase indicated in May, from 10.3
per cent to 9.7 per cent. However, the revision is due to a shortfall
of actual from planned spending in the second quarter, and a substantial
increase is now projected for the second half, whereas earlier only a
slight gain was planned. Manufacturers continue to expect a 5.6 per
cent increase in 1972 as the large shortfall in actual spending from May
second quarter plans is expected to be made up in the second half of the
year. In nonmanufacturing, however, a shortfall in first half spending
by communications firms is not anticipated to be recouped in the second
half.

I -15
expenditures of large manufacturers were about unchanged and unspent
backlogs rose. The bulk of new appropriations is generally spent within
two to three quarters; this survey thus tends to support the spending
plans reported in the Commerce survey.
Construction and real estate. Seasonally adjusted value of
new construction put in place, which was revised downward by 2 per cent
for July, changed little in August at an annual rate of about $121 billion.
Expenditures for residential construction dipped in August from the peak
reached in July. While outlays for both private nonresidential and public
construction apparently held at about'their month earlier rates, they
remained below the highs recorded earlier this year.
Over-all, construction costs have continued to edge up only
moderately this year. As a result, the year-to-year increase in August
in the Census Bureau's composite cost index approximated 3 per cent.
This contrasts with a year-to-year expansion of nearly 8 per cent in
the first quarter of 1972 and 9 per cent in 1971 as a whole.

Seasonally adjusted private housing starts slipped further in
July, although the rate continued above the 2 million unit mark for the
fifteenth oonsecutive month. With residential building permits and
mortgage commitments still exceptionally high, indications are that the
July rate of housing starts was at least maintained in August and the
third quarter average may not be appreciably below the second quarter
pace.

The major part of the starts reduction since the first quarter
has occurred in the multifamily sector. Meanwhile, the potential for
some further downward adjustment in single-family starts over the near
term has increased. Even though sales of new homes by merchant builders
turned up in July to a near-record high, stocks of units available for
sale continued to rise and were at a level equaling 6 months' supply at
the current rate of sales. Except for June, this was the highest stocks-
sales ratio since early 1970.

Cyclical indicators. The Census trend-adjusted composite
index of leading indicators rose .7 per cent in July (p). As in June,
the rate of increase was below that of earlier months.
Leading series increasing in July were initial unemployment
claims (inverted), contracts and orders for plant and equipment, and
the ratio of price-to-unit labor cost. Series declining in July were
new orders for durable goods, stock prices, industrial materials prices,
and housing permits. The average workweek in manufacturing was unchanged.
The coincident composite rose .5 per cent while the lagging
composite declined by .2 per cent, reflecting declines in commercial
and industrial loans outstanding and unit labor cost in manufacturing
and a then-anticipated decline in plant and equipment spending (since
revised) in the third quarter.

Manufacturers' orders and shipments. New orders for
durable goods declined 2.8 per cent in July (p) after a 3.8 per cent
increase in June. Both the June increase and the July decline were
due to swings in defense orders.
Excluding defense, July orders were up 1.4 per cent from
June, because of a substantial increase in motor vehicle orders. July
data for motor vehicle shipments and orders are subject to revision
not only when August preliminary data are received but also when
September data come in, at which time the three months are averaged to
yield the seasonally adjusted series.
Nondefense capital goods orders were unchanged in July at
a level 2.3 per cent higher than the second-quarter average.

Labor market. Nonfarm payroll employment increased by
280,000 in August after little net change in June and July. The August
increase, which partially reflected a reduction in strike activity and
recovery from the storm damage, was about equally divided between the
service and goods-producing industries. Manufacturing employment
increased 85,000 in August, returning to the May-June level of 19.0
million, which was about a half million above the low in August 1971,
but 1.25 million below the summer 1969 peak. The factory workweek edged
up 0.1 hour in August to 40.7 hours, an increase of nearly 1 hour since
last fall. Sizable employment increases were reported in trade,
services, and State and local government.

I -22
Since August 1971 the number of payroll jobs has increased
by about 2.3 million but the bulk of the increase occurred before
May 1972. Since May nonfarm payroll employment has increased at an
annual rate of only 1.3 million with most of the gain in the service-
producing industries. These developments reflect the slower growth
of industrial output in this period.

Unemployment and labor force. The unemployment rate was
essentially unchanged at 5.6 per cent in August, following two months
at 5.5 per cent, as both total employment and the civilian labor force
showed a resurgence after little growth in July. Jobless rates for
most of the major age-sex-color groups showed little change except for
the volatile teenage rate which moved up sharply, reflecting large
increases in joblessness among 16 and 17 year-olds. The unemployment

I -23
rate was about half of one percentage point lower than in the summer
of 1971, with the bulk of the improvement among adult males.
After showing little change since May, the civilian labor
force rose nearly 400,000 in August, to 86.9 million--2.4 million
above a year earlier. Virtually all of the August gain was attributable
to women and teenagers seeking part-time work; over the year, however,
labor force growth has been more evenly distributed among the three
age-sex groups with over 80 per cent of the increment among those work-
ing full-time or seeking full-time employment.

Earnings. Adjusted average hourly earnings of production
and nonsupervisory workers on private nonfarm payrolls rose by 4.4
per cent in August and at a 5.7 per cent annual rate over the past
two months after showing virtually no change from April to June. The
largest advances occurred in construction and transportation.

Since the beginning of the controls program in August 1971
the private nonfarm hourly earnings index has risen by 5.6 per cent,
compared to a 6.9 per cent increase the previous year. Slowing has
been most apparent in the nonindustrial sector, where gains have
averaged less than the Pay Board guidelines, and in the construction
industry. The settlement of the backlog of cases awaiting review by
the Construction Industry Stabilization Committee may result in a
faster growth of construction earnings in the months ahead.

Wholesales prices. Wholesale prices rose at a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 7.9 per cent in August. Compared with August
last year, when price controls were inaugurated, the increase was 4.4
per cent.
The index of industrial commodities rose at an annual rate of
4.6 per cent from July to August with increases widespread. Especially
sharp advances were posted for fuels, hides and leather, and lumber
and plywood. A seasonally adjusted increase for motor vehicles and
equipment also had a major influence on the overall index.
The index of prices of consumer nonfood finished goods
rose faster than in other recent months as higher prices were reported
for gasoline, tires and tubes, furniture, and appliances. Prices of
producer finished goods also rose from July to August largely as a
result of seasonally adjusted increases for motor vehicles and
machinery. Prices of processed and crude materials also moved higher.
Another large monthly increase, 18 per cent at a seasonally
adjusted annual rate, was reported for the August index of farm and
food products. While the index declined 0.2 per cent on a seasonally
unadjusted basis, the seasonal pattern called for a decline of 1.6
per cent. Of major importance to the change were seasonally adjusted
increases for fresh fruits and vegetables, grains, eggs, and dairy
products. Prices of both livestock and meats declined for the first
time since April on a seasonally unadjusted basis, but the declines
were less than expected seasonally.

Near the end of August, the Price Commission denied the
requests of General Motors Corporation and the Ford Motor Company to
raise prices on their 1973-model cars and trucks--except for relatively
small increases which were approved for all Big-Four companies to
cover costs of some optional equipment made standard--because such
increases might increase profit margins above allowable limits.
These companies probably will resubmit their requests for price increases
some time in October. The Price Commission did not deny the requests
of the Chrysler Corporation and American Motors, but their applications

I -27
remain suspended by the Commission's action of late August. Public
hearings on possible increases in prices of motor vehicles began on
September 12.
Given the recent decisions of the Price Commission on prices
of 1973-model cars, the value of quality improvements in 1973 models
reported by the BLS, and the change in prices expected seasonally,
wholesale prices of automobiles can be expected to decline on a
seasonally adjusted basis when prices of the new models are first
reflected in the WPI--probably in the index for October.
Other governmental actions which have been taken concerning
prices since mid-August include the introduction of new controls
on the pricing of coffee at the manufacturers' level, the removal of
export controls on hides, the delay on decisions on requests for
price increases by some food processors pending a review of the
requests by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and the investigation
by the IRS of pricing practices in the lumber industry.

I -28
Consumer prices. Consumer prices rose at a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 5 per cent in July, the largest increase
since last February. Food prices rose sharply, especially meats;
non-food commodities resumed rising after a pause in June, and service
costs continued a moderate upward trend.

capacity insufficient. Prices of used cars and of residences rose
significantly in July. On the other hand, clothing prices fell for
the second month.
Meat prices rose to levels 10 per cent above a year ago
in July as livestock marketings remained below levels of last year.
According to preliminary information, retail meat prices continued
to rise in August as the spread between farm and retail prices of
beef widened further. During Phase II the retail value of beef has
climbed about 10 per cent, but the spread, representing the cost of
packing, transportation and distribution, has increased 25 per cent.
On the other hand, the spread on pork has been reduced as farm
prices have risen very sharply.
Livestock marketings have continued to run below expecta-
tions in August, as they have all year. Unless they rise substan-
tially in September, we may not get the expected seasonal drop in
food prices this fall.
In addition to the relatively short supply of meat, food
prices have been raised by poor growing weather for vegetables and
a reduced fruit crop.
Services connected with home-ownership, insurance--mortgage
interest, taxes, and home repairs--accounted for about two-thirds of
the rise in service costs in July.

Agricultural developments. During the month ending August 15,
prices received by farmers increased 1 per cent reflecting higher prices
for wheat, milk, hogs, lettuce, and grapefruit partly offset by declines
in cattle prices. The index was 13 per cent above a year earlier.
Prices paid by farmers remained unchanged at 6 per cent above last year.
Meat production expanded during August to near the level of
a year earlier after falling off about 5 per cent in July. The increase
in volume was mainly in cattle slaughter, and cattle prices declined 6
per cent but then increased somewhat in early September. August beef

I -31
production was 3 per cent above a year earlier but below that expected
based on large numbers of feed during previous months.
Through September 12 hog prices remained at the high level
established in early July, around $29.00 per 100 pounds liveweight.
Pork production during August was 10 per cent below last year.
Wheat prices have risen about 40 cents per bushel, or 25
per cent, since the Soviet Union agreement was announced on July 8.
The subsidy to wheat exporters, calculated as the difference between
the domestic and world wheat prices, rose from $.07 per bushel on
July 6 to $.47 in late August, Gulf port basis. Grain sales are expect-
ed to total 400 million bushels of wheat and 100 to 180 million
bushels of corn. The Commodity Credit Corporation will finance a
maximum of $500 million of purchases at 6-1/8 per cent interest.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL SITUATION
Short-term yields have increased 25 to 80 basis points since
the last Committee meeting, with the largest increases in the Treasury
bill area. Bill rates had been unusually low relative to other rates
in July and early August because of special demands related to the
advance refunding and acquisitions by foreign central banks. In
recent weeks Treasury debt management, foreign sales, and Federal
Reserve operations (partly to offset a large drop in the Treasury cash
balance at the Fed) increased the market supply of bills by about
$3.4 billion. A considerable portion of these bills flowed to dealer
positions at a time when the Federal funds rate and dealer financing
costs were rising. And, in an environment of increased market un-
certainty regarding the outlook for monetary policy, commercial banks--
with continued strong loan demands--stepped up their CD sales, adding
to upward rate pressure in short-term markets.
Long-term rates have risen 10-35 basis points since the
last Committee meeting. The largest increase was for Treasury bonds
as dealers worked down large positions in the aftermath of the August
advance refunding. Only modest upward rate pressures developed in
the public corporate bond market, where the new issue volume and forward
calendar were relatively light. In the mortgage market, continued
large inflows to the thrift institutions and the high level of commit-
ments and mortgage purchases by commercial banks and nonbank thrift
institutions contributed to the stability of mortgage rates.

II -2
Outlook. Apart from monetary policy actions, the two factors
which are likely to have a major influence on financial market develop-
ments over the balance of the year are Treasury cash borrowing and
business loan demand at commercial banks.
With inventory investment by businesses projected to rise
significantly in the final months of the year, business loan demands
can be expected, at a minimum, to be maintained at a high level.
While banks have substantial liquidity, they can be expected to reduce
their holdings of liquid assets, to step up their CD offering rates,
and to temper their participation in the tax exempt market. At the
same time, Treasury net cash borrowing demands in the fourth quarter--
estimated at $10-$12 billion--are considerably larger than seasonal.
And while about two-fifths of this reflects revenue sharing, much of
which will be re-invested initially, this borrowing is likely to be
concentrated in the last two months of the year.
In long-term markets, corporations probably will continue to
do a substantial proportion of their long-term financing through
equity offerings and private placements, which should lead to a con-
tinuation of the moderate pace of public bond offerings. Mortgage
demands are expected to moderate seasonally, but the volume of tax-
exempt issues is projected to be maintained at a sizable level by
refundings, revenue issues, and industrial aid bonds.
On balance, Treasury and business loan demands suggest upward
pressure on short-term market interest rates as the fourth quarter
progresses. However, in long-term markets upward rate adjustments are

II -3
likely to be limited by the continued more moderate pace of public
bond offerings by corporations and the large, but decelerating, inflow
of funds to mortgage lenders. At the moment, in the context of
expectations of increasing credit demands, particularly in the short-
term area, markets are especially sensitive to indications of any
change in the stance of monetary policy that might significantly
reduce the supply of funds.
Monetary aggregates. M1 growth slowed in August following
the extremely rapid expansion in July, with preliminary data indicating
a moderate 5 per cent rate of increase. This is similar to the rate
recorded in June and for the second quarter as a whole, but analysis
of the weekly pattern of M1 changes over the July-August period
suggests that the underlying trend in August was somewhat stronger than
indicated by the monthly average.
In July, a significant part of the growth in M1, which
Demand Deposit Ownership Survey data suggest was concentrated at non-
financial businesses, developed early in the month and was carried
through a large part of the period. Thus, the high July daily average
base that ensued exaggerated the slowdown in August, when growth was
distributed more evenly over the period. From the last week of July
to the last week of August, M1 expanded at about an 8.5 per cent annual
rate. On balance, therefore, the trend for both months appears
basically stronger than in June and the second quarter.
In retrospect, monetary expansion during the second quarter
appears to have been slower than might have been expected in view of
the rapid increase in nominal GNP. Thus, the acceleration in the two
most recent months may reflect a return to more normal relationships.

Growth in M2 also slowed in August to a 7.5 per cent annual
rate as compared with roughly 11 per cent in the two preceding months.
The slowdown was accounted for entirely by the M1 component, with time
and savings deposits other than large CD's increasing somewhat faster
in August than in July. Even with this acceleration, growth in such
deposits remained below the rapid rates realized earlier in the year,
when interest rates on market securities were lower.
The adjusted credit proxy, as well as M and M2, decelerated
in August, expanding at about a 9 per cent annual rate. In addition
to reduced growth in demand deposits, U.S. Government deposits declined
by about $700 million. Partly offsetting the slower growth in private
demand deposits and decline in U.S. Government deposits, however,
large negotiable CD's outstanding spurted ahead by about $1.2 billion,
and nondeposit sources of funds increased by about $300 million,
primarily through the issuance of commercial paper by bank affiliates.
The rise in outstanding CD's during August occurred despite
a large volume of maturing issues and represented the fifth consecutive
month of significant expansion in such deposits. Since the end of the
first quarter, the cumulative increase in these deposits amounts to
almost $6 billion.
During the second quarter, the increases in CD's were con-
centrated primarily at weekly reporting banks outside New York City,
probably reflecting the consistently strong loan demand at such
institutions. In the two most recent months, growth has persisted at
these banks, as loan demand has continued strong. In addition, however,

II -6
New York City banks have sold increasing amounts of such obligations
during the past two months, as their loan demand--while still far less
buoyant than at banks outside New York City--has shown some signs of
revival.
CD offering rates have risen steadily in most maturity
categories since before mid-August after drifting downward with other
short-term market rates after mid-July. Market rates generally have
risen a bit more rapidly, however, with rates on Treasury bills climbing
at a much faster pace, and the premium on CD's as compared to the latter
issues in particular has narrowed sharply across the maturity spectrum.
While most of the August increase in CD's took place just before this
narrowing, CD funds appear to have been readily available to banks
without aggressive bidding. Given the rises in short rates, banks
might have been expected to make a special effort to nail down longer
term CD money. However, rates on such obligations have moved up less
than those on shorter maturities, the spread between them and rates on
comparable Treasury securities has in fact turned negative, and pre-
liminary data indicate that the average maturity of CD's sold shortened
further in August.
Bank credit. Total bank credit at all commercial banks (last-
Wednesday-of-month series) advanced strongly at an 18 per cent annual
rate during August, with growth in total loans--at an extremely rapid
26 per cent annual rate--the dominant influence. It seems likely that
seasonal adjustment problems inflated the size of the increase in
total loans, but even after taking this into account, loans still were

II -7
by far the most important factor. Holdings of U.S. Government
securities declined on a seasonally adjusted basis, probably reflecting
in large part a smaller volume of new Treasury cash financing than in
the corresponding month of other recent years, but holdings of other
securities--mainly municipals--increased significantly. The size of
the increase in holdings of other securities and the fact that it
included longer- as well as short-term issues is surprising in light
of the apparent strength of loan demands. The rise may reflect in
part, however, some catch-up after little net change over the previous
two months.

II -8
The increase in total loans in August was influenced sig-
nificantly by the increase in business loans. Even allowing for some
overstatement due to seasonal adjustment problems, business loan
demand clearly continues as strong or stronger than in other recent
months, and consistent with this pattern, and the associated rise in
short-term market rates, the prime rate charged by most banks moved
up to 5-1/2 per cent late in the month. As in July, demands at New
York City banks were somewhat stronger than earlier in the year, but
banks outside New York City continued to account for the bulk of the
business loan expansion.
Real estate loans continued to grow rapidly as in other
recent months, and consumer loan growth, while below the peak pace
realized in June, was nonetheless brisk. Furthermore, loans to non-
bank financial institutions expanded sharply for the second month in a
row, due in part to the temporary financing by mortgage bankers of
mortgage inventories pending delivery to final investors under prior
commitments.
Despite the strong surge in loan demand during August, bank
liquidity continues high relative to the level in recent years. At
weekly reporting banks in New York City, the ratio of liquid assets to
liabilities, 1/ after leveling off in July, edged up further in August
to a new peak. At weekly reporting banks outside New York--where loan
demand has been strongest--the ratio edged down, maintaining the trend
evident since the end of the first quarter, but it continues to hover
about the previous highs reached early in 1971.
1/ Liquid assets include Treasury and other securities maturing in one
year or less, loans to brokers and dealers and domestic commercial
banks, holdings of bankers' acceptances and gross sales of Federal
funds. Liabilities equals total liabilities less capital accounts,
valuation reserves, and demand deposits due to banks.

II -9
Nonbank financial institutions and mortgage markets. Deposit
f,lows to nonbank thrift institutions slowed during August from the
rapid pace recorded in June and July, although the dollar volume re-
mained substantial. In fact, savings and loan associations had a
better deposit experience in August 1972 than in any previous August.

Commitment activity at life insurance companies also has
reached record levels. Life companies are committing a large quantity
of both securities and mortgages, and yet are maintaining a generous
leeway between expected cash flow and takedowns of commitments. The
volume of these expected takedowns--small relative to expected cash
flow--leaves the industry with considerable margin even if the large
expected cash flows fail to materialize.
Although deposit flows to nonbank thrift institutions
have declined moderately and bond yields have moved up somewhat, no
significant change in yields has appeared in the sensitive secondary
market for home mortgages. In the latest (September 5) FNMA auction,
yields on forward purchase commitments, at 7.63 per cent, remained
close to the level that has prevailed over the past four months. While
offerings of mortgages to FNMA for future delivery increased sharply,
they were well below the high reached earlier this year.
In August, the average return on home mortgages again changed
little, according to the FHA. In the primary market, the average
contract rate on conventional loans remained at 7.65 per cent on
new-home mortgages, and at 7.70 per cent on existing-home mortgages.
In the secondary market, the average yield on FHA-insured new home loans
edged up by 1 basis point to 7.55 per cent. In both cases, the average
gross yield spread of home mortgages over new issues of high-grade
corporate bonds remained relatively unattractive to diversified lenders.

NOTE: FHA series: interest rates on conventional first mortgages (excluding
additional initial fees and charges) are rounded by FHA to the
nearest 5 basis points. On FHA loans carrying the 7 per cent ceiling
rate in effect since mid-February 1971, a change of 1.0 points in
discount is associated with a change of 12 to 14 basis points in
yield. Gross yield spread is average mortgage return, before de-
ducting servicing costs, minus average yield on new issues of high-
grade corporate bonds with 5-year call protection.
e/ Estimated.
During the second quarter, the average delinquency rate on home
mortgages (MBA) series) increased, contrary to its usual seasonal pattern.
As a result, this measure of credit quality regained its year-earlier level
of 3.27 per cent--still somewhat below the postwar high attained in the
second half of 1971. Delinquency rates on problem-ridden Section 235 FHA-
insured loans--on which interest rates are subsidized down to 1 per cent--
continued to average more than 2 to 3 times higher than those on other
types of Government underwritten home mortgages.

II -13
Short-term interest rates. Interest rates on U. S.
Treasury bills have increased about 60 to 80 basis points since the
August FOMC meeting, while rates on private short-term securities and
bank prime rates generally have advanced 1/4 to 3/8 of a percentage
point. As a result of these movements, the spread
between bill yields and other short-term rates has narrowed recently.
The rapid run-up in bill yields reflected both demand and
supply influences. On the demand side, the unusually heavy purchases
of bills by foreign central banks and switches to bills by holders of
rights in the August 15 financing--which previously had served to
depress bill rates--were terminated. In addition, there has been a
sharp expansion in the supply of bills that the private market has
had to absorb. On August 18, the Treasury announced that the size of
its monthly offering of one-year bills would be increased by $600
million for three auctions,August through October. The Treasury also
raised cash over the past few weeks by running down the Exchange
Stabilization Fund's holdings of Treasury bills by about $1 billion.
In addition, foreign account holdings of bills were reduced by about
$600 million over the period, with part of the proceeds used to
finance a buildup in holdings of longer-term securities. Finally,
System bill holdings have been reduced (by redemptions as well as
market sales) by about $1.2 billion, mainly in order to offset a
temporary rundown in the Treasury's balances at the Federal Reserve.

II -14
The tendency for interest rates to rise because of the shift
in supply-demand conditions was reinforced by a firming in money
market conditions during the week ending September 2 which kept the
Federal funds rate above 5 per cent for three straight days and
resulted in a concurrent increase in dealer borrowing costs. Money
market conditions have subsequently eased, and while securities
markets remain in an uncertain state, they have displayed a somewhat
more comfortable tone in recent days.
At least part of the explanation for the reaction to the
temporary firming in money market conditions was that the Treasury
securities market was in a weak technical condition. As a result of
the expanded bill supply, dealer positions in these issues were at
levels well above normal. In addition, the general rise in short-term
rates encouraged dealers to reduce their still rather sizable positions
in longer term issues acquired in the Treasury's mid-August financing.
A preliminary estimate of the seasonally adjusted volume
of commercial paper issued through dealers indicates that borrowing in
this sector of the market declined about $900 million in August,
after having remained about unchanged in July. Thus, part of the
marginal improvement in loan demands at New York banks over this
period may be the result of a shift from open market to bank financing.
If such a shift has occurred, however, it was not due to an alteration
in relative borrowing costs which remained essentially unchanged over
the period.

Long-term securities. The impact on long-term rates of rising
short-term rates was greatest in the Government securities markets,
where long-term yields have advanced over 30 basis points during the
last 5 weeks in the aftermath of the large mid-August advance
refunding,

II -16
Yields on new corporate bonds, after drifting downward
throughout most of August, rose about 8 basis points in the final
week of the month and currently are slightly higher than at the
time of the last FOMC meeting. It is reported that corporate dealers'
secondary inventories of bonds are higher than normal, and this
situation may result in more upward pressure on bond yields in the
immediate future, particularly if short-term rates continue to rise.
The early August decline and the end-of-month turnaround
in tax-exempt yields were somewhat more pronounced than in the
corporate market. The Bond Buyer Index on September 8 stood about
15 basis points higher than in mid-August. While the monthly volume
of municipal offerings remains high, both commercial banks and
casualty insurance companies are reported to be acquiring long-term
tax-exempts at a slower pace in recent weeks. As in the corporate
market, dealers appear to have been positioning rather heavily.

Corporate public bond offerings were relatively light in
August, amounting to about $1.5 billion. The September calendar now
appears to be only about $1.1 billion, the lowest since December 1971.
Although sone seasonal increase in issue volume is to be expected in
October, underwriters report little apparent interest in long-term

II -18
public bond financing on the part of industrial corporations. The
public utility industry, which normally accounts for a large propor-
tion of public bond volume and continues to be in need of construction
funds, is currently doing about half of its long-term financing through
the sale of equity issues; this trend is likely to continue for the
next few months at least.
Activity in the private placement market has been unusually
heavy this year. The second quarter volume of takedowns was over
$2.6 billion, just short of the record in the fourth quarter 1965.
Insurance companies are said to be still actively seeking private
placements, but the fact that yields on these securities dropped in
July suggests that the institutions have not been able to satisfy
their potential demand. The staff estimates that the volume of take-
downs in July and August was below earlier levels, but expects some
increase in September and October.

Federal finance. The Staff is presently projecting a $32.0
billion deficit in the Federal budget for fiscal 1973,nearly $1 billion
more than in the August Greenbook. This change is attributable en-
tirely to a reduction in the estimate of receipts based on recent
shortfalls below earlier projections.
While our estimate of total fiscal year budget outlays has
not changed--at $257.0 billion--the pattern of spending has been
adjusted to reflect a delay in the expected enactment of the general
revenue-sharing bill that would place the retroactive payment in
October rather than September. In addition, the NIA figures for de-
fense purchases have been lowered somewhat in the third and fourth
quarters of calendar 1972 to reflect a technical revision in these
accounts. However, considerable uncertainty has arisen with respect
to defense spending in fiscal 1973 because of the cuts in defense
appropriations recently made by the House Appropriations Committee.
Thus far, the staff estimates have not been revised to reflect the
Committee action because Congress may not go along with it and because
the amount and timing of the cuts have not been determined.
As for the high employment budget, the projected shift
toward deficit has been pushed forward to the fourth quarter in line
with the Staff assumption that the retroactive payment of $16.0
billion (annual rate) in revenue-sharing will be made in October.
The Treasury cash balance totaled $5.0 billion at the end of
August, about $1.2 billion less than estimated in the August Greenbook
due to errors in projections of both receipts and expenditures. The

II -21
Treasury has managed to get by with a very low balance in tax and
loan accounts in early September. A low point of $1.4 billion in
the combined tax and loan and Federal Reserve balance was reached on
September 11, but because of technical limitations on Treasury calls
of tax and loan balances, the Treasury had a small overdraft--
$38.0 million--at the Federal Reserve on September 12. Over the rest
of September the combined balance is expected to rise, particularly
after the mid-month tax date, reaching a level of about $9.5 billion
by month's end. No further market borrowing is expected in September.
Looking further ahead, Treasury net cash borrowing is expected
to total about $11 billion in the fourth quarter. The first major
instalment of this financing--totaling about $4.0 billion--is likely
to be needed in the latter part of October assuming the retroactive
payment of revenue-sharing follows the pattern indicated above.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
Summary and outlook. After reaching a peak deficit of
$5.1 billion for the month of July, the official settlements balance
of payments registered diminishing weekly deficits during August --
probably totaling under $1 billion for the month. (Both figures would
be somewhat smaller on a seasonally adjusted basis.) In the early days
of September a small surplus was registered. Measured on the liquidity
basis, the July deficit was about $3.7 billion -- smaller than the
official settlements deficit because liabilities to foreign branches
and other foreign commercial banks were reduced; in August the liquidity
deficit was probably a bit larger than the official settlements deficit.
The dollar strenghtened in the exchange markets after mid-
July as the Federal Reserve intervened in the market, with considerable
psychological effect, in support of the Smithsonian rate structure. Over-
sold positions on the dollar were probably whittled down, and major
currencies that had been at their ceilings moved toward their central
rates. Over this period, Japan has been the only major industrial country
with a large intake of dollars. More recently, a rise in short-term
interest rates in the United States relative to rates abroad has also
contributed to the market strength of the dollar.
Preliminary data for the second quarter show a marked
improvement in the balance on current account and long-term capital,
but this consisted primarily of a sharp change in the behavior of
private capital flows, which is unlikely to persist, and a bunching up

III -2
of payments by some countries for future deliveries of military goods.
The shift in recorded private capital flows included an extraordinary
drop in U.S. direct investments abroad, a turn to large net inflows
of foreign direct investment capital, and a reversal of the first quarter
increase in banking claims on foreigners. The latter inflows largely
reflect encouragement of reflows by the Japanese authorities.
The balance on goods and services worsened from the first to
the second quarter, and is projected to register large, but diminishing,
deficits for quite some time. Somewhat stronger gains now expected in
the U.S. economy will raise imports and tend to offset the benefits
to exports from the sustained economic upturn that is in progress in
other industrial countries. Currently there is rising apprehension in
Europe -- especially in Germany -- about inflationary pressures. To
the extent this leads to the adoption of measures of fiscal and monetary
restraint in some countries, the outlook for gains in the U.S. trade
balance next year would be clouded, and financial flows would also
be less favorable.
Foreign exchange and Euro-dollar markets. The dollar generally
strengthened against major foreign currencies over the past month.
Intervention by major foreign central banks has been minimal except in
the case of the Bank of Japan. That bank purchased $721 million in
market intervention in August, and thus far in September has purchased
another $188 million. Despite these large intervention purchases

III -3
Japanese official reserves have grown by smaller amounts ($488 million
in August) as a result of that government's "recycling" of its dollar
intake. One method used has been government dollar deposits with
Japanese banks, leading to short-term capital exports by those banks.

Among the factors tending to support the dollar in the exchanges
in the face of a continued large U.S. basic balance deficit were the
System's intervention in the exchange markets to support the dollar
(discussed in detail in the Special Manager's Report on System and
Treasury Operations in Foreign Exchange) and, more recently, the rise
in short-term interest rates in the United States. The intervention
had a strong favorable impact on market confidence and, together with
the effect of some rise in U.S. interest rates, has probably induced
some reversal of speculative positions.

III -4
The rise in U.S. short-term interest rates in recent weeks,
together with smaller rises in national money market rates abroad,

The overnight rate moved back below the Federal funds rate
after having exceeded it in late July and early August, and differentials
between one- and three-month Euro-dollars and comparable maturity
U.S. bank CD's declined. Liabilities of U.S. banks to their foreign
branches continued to average close to the banks' reserve-free bases,
amounting to about $2 billion.
Balance of payments. The official settlements balance in
the weeks of August showed diminishing deficits, and a small surplus
was registered in the early days of September. For the month of
August the deficit is estimated at less than $1 billion. This sharp
recovery from the $5.1 billion deficit in July reflected the easing
of speculative tensions after the exchange market interventions by
the System that began on July 19, with strong psychological effect,
and some relative tightening of short-term interest rates in the
United States in the course of the month. No data are yet available
for current account or private capital flows during the month, but
the improvement in the over-all balance most likely reflected a return
flow of short-term capital and an unwinding of leads and lags that
built up in the aftermath of the sterling crisis in late June and
into July.
More complete data for the second quarter balance of payments
show some surprisingly erratic behavior in the long-term capital
accounts, adding to the difficulties of interpreting the current

III -6
situation. Outflows of U.S. private long-term capital dropped by
$1.0 billion between the first and second quarters, mainly because
direct-investment outflows fell to only $200 million, far under usual
second-quarter rates. There is as yet no explanation of this decline.
Meanwhile the net inflow of foreign private long-term capital rose

by $.7 billion, almost entirely reflecting a return flow of funds
remitted from the U.S. in the first quarter by U.S. affiliates of
Japanese trading companies. Another favorable factor in the second
quarter was a one-time rise in advance payments by a few foreign
governments for military deliveries -- reducing the aggregate net
outflow for U.S. Government grants and credits.
These swings in flows of capital rather arbitrarily defined
as "long-term" served to reduce the basic deficit (the sum of current
account and long-term capital transactions) to an annual rate of
about $8 billion, from a $14 billion rate in the first quarter.
In the present quarter the current account balance is probably
improving, but not by as much as the likely rise in net outflows
of long-term capital, so that the "basic" deficit may be closer to
the first half rate of $11 billion.
The big favorable shift in recorded flows of short-term
capital between the first and second quarters had already been
indicated by earlier reports. In July, however, there was again a
large net increase in bank-reported claims on foreigners. Moreover,
the large negative errors and omissions now appearing in the second
quarter accounts very likely reflects unrecorded outflows in the
last part of June which continued into early July, swelling the
deficit in that month. The improvement in the over-all balance
since early August indicates that some reversal of short-term flows
is occurring.

III -8
U.S. foreign trade. The U.S. trade deficit in July was
virtually unchanged from those of the two preceding months as both
exports and imports increased by the same amounts from June to July.
The deficit in May-July was at an annual rate of $7.1 billion (balance
of payments basis), down only moderately from the very high $7.9
billion deficit rate recorded in the months of February-April. The
value of exports in May-July was about 3-1/2 percent greater than in
the earlier three-month period; almost all of the increase was in
volume as prices (unit-values) rose only very slightly. The value
of imports rose by 1.5 percent but imports fell in volume terms as
prices rose by 2 percent.
The July trade figures reaffirm our earlier impression that
the commodity structure of imports has shifted, with the major element
of strength now in imports of industrial materials and foods, whereas
imports of finished goods -- automobiles and other consumer goods,
capital equipment -- which were rising in the early months of the
year, have fallen off. Virtually all of the increase in the value
of imported industrial materials -- steel and other metals plus
further advances in petroleum and lumber -- was in real terms.
However, higher prices accounted for most of the rise in the value
of imported foodstuffs -- particularly coffee and meat -- as worldwide
demands exceeded supplies.
Imports of automobiles from Europe and Japan declined
significantly in June and July, reflecting a downward adjustment in

III -9
inventories which had been built up in the earlier months of the year
as new models were introduced. Sales of these cars in the U.S. have
held steady this year at an annual rate of about 1-1/2 million units,
although sales in August rose somewhat. The share of these cars in
total U.S. car sales, however, has dipped below the 15 percent posted
in 1971. Although imports of automobiles from Canada have also declined
in May-July, entries of these "North-American" type of cars have
remained at a high level as total domestic car sales have surged.
The value of imports of other nonfood consumer goods -- both
durable and nondurable -- as well as capital equipment have all declined
in the last three-month period despite further rises in prices of these
goods. It is possible that the effect of the revaluation of currencies
may be beginning to take hold, although the seamen's 90-day strike in
Japan, which ended in mid-July, as well as the "voluntary" agreement
on textiles, may be in part responsible for the slowdown in these
imports.
The export rise in May-July stemmed primarily from a con-
tinued expansion in shipments of agricultural products, particularly
grains and soybeans. A further rise in exports of these commodities
can be expected as shipments of the $1 billion of grains sold to the
Soviet Union (about one-half of which is on CCC credit) begin to
move out in heavy volume in the next few months. Shipments of auto-
mobile parts to Canada also rose sharply in May-July as car output there

III -10
(mostly for sale in the United States) expanded. A feature of July
exports was an increase in shipments of machinery and nonagricultural mate-
rials (chemicals and metals) which had been flat since February. Exports
to Western Europe, which had been extremely weak in the first half
of the year, also rose sharply in July.
The reported U.S. share of world trade in manufactured goods
in the first and second quarters of this year, compared with year-
earlier periods, appears to have declined very sharply. However,
this decline is probably largely artificial, resulting from the
immediate conversion of the export figures of foreign countries from
national currencies to dollars at the new appreciated exchange rates,
even though it is unlikely that their actual proceeds responded so
quickly. When the share computation is made on the basis of the pre-
Smithsonian exchange rates, the U.S. share in world trade of manufactured
goods decreased only slightly.

III -11
Economic conditions abroad. The business climate has con-
tinued to strengthen in virtually all industrial countries since the
beginning of this year. However, recoveries are at various stages and
the amount of unused capacity differs considerably among countries.
The upswing in the United States, Canada and, earlier this year, in
Britain, has been sufficiently strong to absorb some unused capacity.
In other countries the acceleration in the pace of economic activity
has been sufficient only to bring them back to near trend growth, so
that there has been little or no absorption of unused capacities; Bel-
gium, France and the Scandinavian countries would fall into this group.
However, in most of these countries, and particularly in France, econom-
ic activity in the preceding months had not fallen much below trend, so
that the amount of underutilized resources was rather small. This is also
the case for Germany where growth rates, although on the uptrend, still
remain below trend rates, and where, in fact, growth in industrial output
at least, has leveled off since last spring. In Japan, where under-
utilization of resources is substantial, the upturn also has not as yet
broadened out sufficiently to absorb these resources.
There is little doubt that by end of the year most economies
will be expanding at -- or above--trend rates. In the case of Italy,
the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, however, this is less certain.
In Italy, underlying economic conditions remain weak and continue to
be influenced by political/social disturbances. In the Netherlands,
there has been a pickup in economic activity after the slowdown last

III -12
year, but the government's concern about the unabatedly high rates
of inflation may well lead to restrictive measures designed to keep
the upturn from accelerating too fast. In the United Kingdom, there
are signs that the recovery may be less broad-based than appeared
this spring as fixed investment expenditures have continued to fall.
In virtually all cases, the faster pace of activity has not
been accompanied by significant reductions in the relatively high
rates of unemployment that existed towards the end of last year. In
some instances, such as in France, this is related to structural changes,
but in most cases it is related to the high productivity increases that
accompany the early stages of an economic upturn.
Although there has been a slowing in the rate of price in-
creases, as measured by the GNP deflators, there is concern in many
countries that with the resumption of growth, this deceleration may
come to an early end. This concern appears particularly strong in
Germany, though the evidence of an acceleration in price increases is
not conclusive. In Canada and the United Kingdom, price rises have
begun to accelerate again, while in a number of Scandinavian countries
and the Netherlands, the evidence points towards continued high in-
flationary pressures. All of these latter countries have used price
and wage policies actively in the past, and some continue to have re-
straints in force.

III -13
As the current outlook points to continued economic accelera-
tion in most countries, policy concern is shifting from preoccupation
with slack demand to concern about the resumption of inflationary
pressures. Therefore, in some continental European countries the period
of generally expansionary or permissive policy posture, which character-
ized the past several quarters, may well be past, and at least in some
cases, restraints may reappear at rather early stages of the recovery.
The Canadian economy has been experiencing a period of rising
expansion since the 1970 recession. From 1970 to 1971 real GNP in-
creased at a rate of 5.5 per cent. Between the first half of 1971 and
the first half of 1972 the rate of output growth accelerated to about
6-1/2 per cent.
Price trends have been mixed. The rate of increase in con-
sumer prices decelerated from 4.9 per cent in January 1972 over January
1971 to 4.5 per cent in July 1972 over July 1971, but there was a slight
acceleration in the rate of increase in general wholesale prices during
the first half of this year.
The demand for business loans has been strong and banks'
excess cash reserves are relatively low. Short-term interest rates
have increased only slightly since the first of the year, but long-term
yields have turned up sharply as chartered banks have sold a significant
part of their holdings to finance growing loan demand.
Fiscal and monetary policies in Canada have been expansionary
in order to support the recovery and to reduce unemployment. Although
the rate of unemployment has declined from almost 7 per cent to about

III -14
6 per cent, the level is still embarrassingly high for the Government,
which faces an election on October 30. The federal budget, which was
presented in June, is very expansionary, and includes provisions for an
acceleration of depreciation allowances for industry and a reduction
in the profits tax.
The recovery of the British economy, which became apparent
last spring, is primarily driven by increased consumer spending and
secondarily by rising exports. Private investment spending, however,
fell short of earlier expectations and was down 7 per cent in the first
half of this year as compared with the second half of 1971. Thus, the
recovery seems somewhat less broad-based than had been hoped. Neverthe-
less, the upturn in output in the second quarter of this year reflected
more than a make-up for the decline in the first quarter due to the coal
strike, bringing real CDP in the first half of 1972 to a level 0.8 per
cent above the second half of 1971.
Monetary policy has been easy, as evidenced by the relatively
fast expansion in the money stock. The Bank of England seems reluctant
to slow down the rate of monetary expansion,apparently fearing interest
rates might rise further above the presently high levels.
In July the Confederation of British Industry announced a three-
month extension, through the end of October, of its voluntary price re-
straint policy. Hundreds of firms, including a large proportion of major
firms, have agreed to limit price increases in the year ending October 31,
1972, to an average of 5 per cent. In July wholesale and retail prices

III -15
were both about 6 per cent higher than a year earlier. With average
earnings rising at an annual rate of 9-10 per cent, real earnings have
generally increased. Wage rates are rising faster than average earn-
ings, the gap reflecting continued, albeit diminishing, hours of short-
time work.
One of the Government's main policy goals since March has
been to improve the wage-price environment by encouraging cooperation
among the employers, unions and the Government through voluntary price
restraints, tri-partite talks and studies of relevant issues. The
Government thereby hopes to avoid the more formal, statutory, wage and
price program urged upon it by some outside observers.
In Germany, the economy is recovering from the slowdown
which began in 1970 and extended through 1971. Industrial production,
though flat in recent months after a sharp first-quarter upturn, was
2.3 per cent higher in May-July than in the same period last year and
4.2 per cent above the fourth quarter 1971 low. According to government
forecasts, real CNP is expected to increase at a seasonally adjusted annu-
al rate of 5.5 per cent in the second half of this year.
All major GNP components appear to have contributed to the
economy recovery, the largest proportionate increase from the second half
of 1971 to the first half of 1972 being in construction activity.
With the pick-up in the economy, the Government is now giving
top priority to measures to prevent a further acceleration of the rate
of inflation. The rate of increase in consumer prices has accelerated,

III -16
rising at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.1 per cent from the
fourth to the first quarter, and by 5.6 per cent from the first to
the second quarter. Prices also rose sharply in July. On the other
hand, there has been some deceleration in the rate of increase in the
prices of producers' industrial products. One measure which the
Government has taken is the cancellation of its plan to spend DM 4 bil-
lion this year in "anti-cyclical reserve" funds. Furthermore, in order
to slow capital inflows and to offset the liquidity-increasing effect
of these inflows, the authorities in May-July, increased bank reserve
requirements, reduced rediscount quotas for banks, increased cash de-
posit requirements on non-bank borrowing from abroad, and imposed
direct controls over bond sales to non-residents.
Short-term interest rates have generally declined this year,
although there was some upward movement in August. Long-term rates
have fluctuated considerably, but were not significantly different at
the end of August from their levels at the beginning of the year.
In France, the paceof economic activity slowed somewhat in
the latter part of 1971 and early 1972, but appears to have picked up
again since last spring. Industrial production increased at a season-
ally adjusted annual rate of around 6 per cent during the first half
of 1972, somewhat below the 7.8 per cent increase in 1971. Real Gross
Internal Product (a French equivalent of Gross Domestic Product less
services of government employees and domestic servants) rose 5.2 per

III -17
cent in 1971 from 1970 and only a fractionally higher increase is
expected this year. These growth rates are below the 6 per cent
target set in the Sixth Economic Plan, but next year's increase is
expected to be much nearer the target rate, with faster growing ex-
ports and fixed investment expenditures providing the extra strength.
A stimulative fiscal policy during the first half of this
year helped to prevent a progressive slowdown in economic activity.
Public investment outlays were accelerated (from an increase of 2.9 per
cent in real terms in 1971 to an estimated 6.3 per cent in 1972), and
enterprises' value-added tax payments were reduced.
Partly in response to an easing of monetary policy earlier
this year, interest rates have declined. Both short-term rates in the
money market and bond yields have decreased since January or February.
Price controls were eased in the spring of this year, even though retail
prices are expected to rise at the relatively rapid rates of 5-1/2 per
cent this year and 5 per cent next year, as compared to a 5.4 per cent
increase in 1971 over 1970.
In Italy, industrial production increased in the second
quarter of this year, rising 2 per cent between March and June. Last
fall production had increased sharply, but then declined from December
through March. Despite the pickup in the second quarter, output in June was
still 0.7 per cent below the December-January level, and in the first
half of 1972 was only 2 per cent higher than a year earlier. Building
activity has been running below the 1971 level.

III -18
Private investment remains depressed, and businessmen are
apprehensive that this fall's new round of wage negotiations will force
new increases in unit labor costs. Private consumption is sluggish.
The only sectors providing stimulus to the economy are the public sector
and exports, the latter of which were up 18 per cent (valued in lire)
in the first half over the comparable 1971 period.
Monetary conditions have been eased still further in recent
months and bond yields have continued to fall quite rapidly. The central
government's cash deficit is still expected to widen sharply this year.
Although the increase in public investment has been revised downward,
social security pensions were increased effective July 1. Despite weak
aggregate demand, the rise in consumer prices has accelerated in recent
months. In June, consumer prices were 5.5 per cent above June 1971.
In mid-August the Government revised downward its forecast for
the gain in real GNP this year over 1971 from 4.8 per cent to 4.3 per
cent, mainly because of the lower forecast for public investment. Even
the 4.3 per cent figure seems optimistic, however, and a 3 per cent
rise now seems a realistic expectation.
The Belgian economy has been experiencing a cyclical upturn
since about the beginning of the year. Industrial production rose at a
seasonally-adjusted annual rate of 8-1/2 per cent during 1971 (fourth
quarter to fourth quarter).

III -19
Private consumption has been rising more rapidly in 1972.
By the beginning of the year the depressing effect on purchases of
consumer durables caused by the introduction of the TVA in January
1971 had worn off. Consumption was also buoyed by increased confi-
dence following the end of 1971.
Exports and the budget are the other two sources of strength.
The value of exports (in Belgian francs) has been rising much faster
since the beginning of 1972 than it did during 1971. The 1972 budget,
drawn up in January, was designed to speed recovery by providing for
much large increases in both ordinary and extraordinary expenditures
than in the immediately preceding years, with a consequent large in-
crease in the deficit.
Plant and equipment expenditures (in real terms) for 1972
as a whole are expected to be about 3 per cent below the 1971 level.
The 1972 rise in real GNP is projected at 3.8 per cent, only fractionally
above the 1971 rise. But officials expect economic activity to be rising
fast enough in 1973 to warrant a restrictive budget, which is now in
preparation.
After considerable sluggishness in 1971, the Netherlands
economy is now in a period of recovery and economic growth has been
above earlier expectations. Industrial production increased at a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of only 3.6 per cent between the first
and fourth quarters of last year, but then rose at an amazing 17 per
cent annual rate from the fourth quarter of last year to the first
quarter of this year and at an 8 per cent rate for the first to the
second quarter of this year.

III -20
The primary policy goal of the Government has been to slow
the rate of inflation, but so far it has not been successful. Con-
sumer prices rose at an annual rate of 9 per cent between the fourth
quarter of 1971 and the second quarter of this year, or at about the
same rate as in the same period a year earlier.
Monetary conditions have been easy due mainly to a large in-
flow of funds in the first quarter and again in July. As a result,
short-term interest rates have declined to below 1 per cent for call
money. On September 8 the Netherlands Bank reduced its discount rate
from 4 to 3 per cent in a technical move aimed at bringing its dis-
count rate into line with market rates. No basic easing of monetary
conditions was intended since the Netherlands Bank at the same time
announced measures designed to tighten monetary conditions. New re-
serve requirements were imposed upon the commercial banks, and the Bank
also plans to carry out restrictive open market operations.
In the Scandinavian countries economic recovery is generally
underway following recessionary conditions in 1971. In Denmark, the
economic recovery has been spurred by increases in domestic consumption
and residential construction, as well as by an increase in exports.
Economic recovery in Sweden from the November-December 1971 low, has
been aided by new orders, especially for export goods. In Finland,
where the rate of economic growth in 1971 was the slowest in a decade,
economic activity is currently recovering under the stimulus of an
expansionary budget policy. Norway, on the other hand, experienced

III -21
only a slight slowdown last year, and with currently weak consumer
demand, this trend is continuing into 1972. Consequently real GNP
is expected to grow by 4.5 per cent this year over 1971, as compared
to 4.8 per cent last year.
Economic recovery in Japan appears to be well underway.
Industrial production has been increasing since last November and
through June rose at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 14 per cent.
Between the third quarter of 1970 and August-October of 1971, in-
dustrial production had increased only by 3.4 per cent. Real GNP
rose at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 11.6 per cent in the
first quarter of this year, in contrast with a 6.3 per cent increase
in calendar 1971 over the previous year. During the late 1960's real
GNP increased each year at a rate of about 12 per cent.
Monetary policy has continued to remain relatively easy in
Japan, with businesses and banks experiencing an excess of liquidity.
Interest rates have declined substantially, with both the call loan
rate and the Bank of Japan's basic discount rate being at a record low
of 4.25 per cent. Price trends have been mixed, with wholesale prices
in July being 1.0 per cent higher than the previous low in January,
but consumer prices rising at a 12-month rate of about 5 per cent in
July, down from the 7 per cent rate of a year earlier.
One of Japan's major policy objectives--moderation of the
balance of payments surpluses without another yen revaluation--is being
partly pursued through a multi-action program to open up Japan's

III -22
banking and securities markets to overseas borrowers, as well as to
promote direct and portfolio investment abroad. Also, at the recent
summit meeting in Hawaii, the Japanese authorities agreed to acceler-
ate their payments for purchases of about $1.1 billion in U. S. goods
and services and to help remove non-tariff obstacles to the growth of
imports.
Japanese economic recovery is expected to continue this year
and next, with real GNP increasing at a rate of about 8 to 9 per cent
in 1972 compared to 1971.

APPENDIX A: LOAN COMMITMENT SURVEY*
The results of the July 31 Quarterly Survey of Loan
Commitments indicate that the volume of unused commitments outstanding
at the forty-two repsonding banks increased about 5 per cent since the
end of April -- a moderate rate of growth by historical standards.
(See Table 1A.) All major categories of unused commitments shared in
the growth, although, as would be expected, commitments to commercial
and industrial firms recorded the largest increase. Commitments to
nonbank financial institutions showed greater strength than in the
previous survey, and commitments for real estate mortgages continued
to grow at a rapid pace.
A high level of takedowns, expirations, and cancellations
and a large volume of new commitment extensions are recorded in the
current survey. (See Tables 1B and 1C.) Much of this activity may
be explained by summer reviews of credit lines where bankers renew
expiring commitments.
Recent data also reflect considerable activity in commitments
for term lending (Tables 1A, 1B, 1C). Newspaper reports indicate that
banks recently have been trying to expand such lending. For example,
some banks have emphasized "cap loans," whereby the interest rate on
term loans disbursed under a commitment would be kept at some fixed
relation to the prevailing prime rate, but the average interest cost
over the life of the loan is guaranteed not to exceed some maximum.
Nonetheless, increasing activity in commitments for term loans has not
as yet been translated into inreased proportions of term loans in
bank loan portfolios.
More than half of the respondents note continued optimism
about loan demand during the next three months with 26 banks anticipating
an increased level of takedown activity. Notwithstanding these expecta-
tions of increased takedowns, banks were virtually unanimous in maintain-
ing previously established commitment policies. (See Table 2.)
