Prefatory Note  
 
 
The attached document represents the most  complete and accurate version available 
based on original copies culled from the f iles of the FOMC Secretariat at the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve Syst em.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization proce ss which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain. 
 Please note that some material may have b een redacted from this document if that 
material was received on a confidential ba sis.  Redacted material is indicated by 
occasional gaps in the text or by gray boxe s around non-text content.  All redacted 
passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable provisions of the Freedom of

1  In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic 
format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to rem ove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing). 
 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optical character recognition computer program (OCR) 
first created electronic text from the document im age.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, 
staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.  Pl ease note that the numbers and text in charts and 
tables were not reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff.

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
GNP is projected to have risen in the third quarter by about
$24 billion or 6 per cent in real terms--a substantial gain but short of
the exceptional performance in the second quarter. This slowing
reflects a smaller rise in inventory investment than in the second
quarter as well as a more moderate increase in consumer expenditures and
an unexpected decline in defense purchases (apparently amounting to
about $2.5 billion annual rate). This drop in defense outlays is
probably temporary, due partly to accelerated spending in the second
quarter preceding the end of the fiscal year. Price increases have
been somewhat more moderate than expected and we are now projecting
about a 3 per cent increase in the fixed weight GNP price index for the
third quarter.
Industrial production and employment picked up as the third
quarter progressed. Industrial output is tentatively estimated to have
risen at around a 6 per cent annual rate in September for the second
month in a row, following a fairly slow rate of growth from May through
July. Nonfarm payroll jobs, including manufacturing, also rose strongly
in September for the second month in a row. However, the unemployment
rate continued in the 5-1/2 per cent range (5.5 per cent in September
versus 5.6 per cent in August) with both employment and the labor force
again showing substantial gains.
Retail sales edged off in September following increases in
the previous two months. For the quarter as a whole, however, sales
averaged 2 per cent above the second quarter. Following introduction of

I -2
1973 models at 1972 prices, sales of new domestic-type autos surged in
the last 10 days of September, boosting seasonally adjusted sales for
the month to a new 1972 high. Other indicators of business activity
remain relatively strong. Business inventories were being accumulated
on average in July and August at close to the second quarter rate but
they continue low relative to sales. Excluding the volatile defense
component, new orders for durable goods in those two months rose about
as rapidly as in the second quarter, with particular strength in primary
metals and motor vehicles. Private housing starts showed unexpected
and probably temporary strength in August.
Recent data indicate quite moderate rates of rise in wages
and prices. The adjusted index of hourly earnings in nonfarm industries
increased at an annual rate of about 4-1/2 per cent in August and
September--and about the same increase since January. Consumer prices
rose at a 3 per cent annual rate in August, and although food prices
again rose rapidly, increases in service prices slowed considerably
further. The wholesale price increase in September moderated to a
3-1/2 per cent rate, following advances of about 8 per cent in both
July and August, with smaller increases in industrial commodities as
well as in farm products; prices of consumer foods declined somewhat.
Outlook. Staff GNP projections continue to show a significant
increase in real output in the fourth quarter--about 8 per cent, annual
rate. The latest consumer surveys report a marked improvement in
optimism, and consumer buying power will be bolstered by the 20 per cent

I -3
increase in social security benefits which took effect early this month.
The fourth quarter should also be strengthened by a projected rebound
in defense purchases following the third quarter drop.
The outlook for 1973 is about the same as previously pro-
jected. Outlays for capital goods are projected to continue to move
up through the end of the year. Among final demand sectors, only
residential construction activity is expected to slow. With inventory-
sales ratios low, we anticipate a moderate but steady rise in inventory
investment, with stocks growing about in line with final sales. Un-
employment is expected to decline to slightly under 5 per cent by the
fourth quarter of 1973. This outlook is based on the same monetary
assumption adopted four weeks ago--a rate of monetary growth indexed
by expansion in M1 at an 8 per cent rate in the second half of 1972
and 6 per cent thereafter.
The staff is now projecting somewhat smaller price increases
for the next several quarters than formerly, consistent with the trend
toward more moderate rates of wage and price increases. Also, the rise
in the minimum wage previously projected for this quarter is now assumed
to be deferred until mid-1973. Costs and prices are expected to rise
more rapidly next year, particularly if the control program is terminated
next April, as we are still assuming. Prices, as measured by the
private GNP fixed weight index, are projected to be rising at about a
4-1/4 per cent rate in the second half of next year as compared with
slightly less than 3 per cent in the current half year.

Industrial production. Industrial production is tentatively
estimated to have increased at least one-half per cent further or
more in September to about 115 per cent (1967=100). This marks the
second month of fairly rapid increases following a slow rate of
growth from May through July. Gains in output are indicated for equip-
ment and materials with little change in consumer goods. Output in
the third quarter is expected to be up at an annual rate of 4 per cent
from the se ond quarter, compared with an 11.6 per cent rise from the
first to second quarter. In September the index was 7 per cent above
a year earlier.
Available production data for September indicate little
change in output of durable consumer goods from levels prevailing since
April. Auto assemblies in September were unchanged from the July-
August rate of 8.5 million units. Production schedules for October
and the fourth quarter, however, indicate an output increase of 9
per cent to about a 9.3 million unit rate. In early September, pro-
liminary data, however, suggest a further rise in production or
business and some defense equipment, and a gain in output of aircraft.
Among materials, weekly data indicate that output of raw
steel was up one per cent but production of paper board and crude oil
was about unchanged. Further increases in output of nonferrous
metals, fabricated metal products, and paper and chemical products are
also indicated in the preliminary information.

I -8
Capacity utilization. Capacity utilization in manufacturing
has been rising over the past year although it remains relatively low--
an estimated 78 per cent in August, in comparison with 74 per cent in
August of 1971.
Productivity and labor costs. Gains in industrial pro-
ductivity slowed in the third quarter. The third quarter average
increase in industrial unit labor cost was, however, somewhat smaller
than the increase in the second quarter. The increase in unit labor
costs over the past year was 2 per cent, well below the increases in
the previous year. (These data are based on FR index of industrial
production for output, and Labor Department wage and manhour data
adjusted by FR.

Retail sales. In September retail sales were off 1.4
per cent from August, according to the advance estimate, but this
decline follows two months of strong increases and the third quarter
average is 2.1 per cent above the second quarter. In the third quarter,
sales of durable goods were relatively stronger than nondurables with
a gain of 3.0 per cent, most attributable to higher sales reported
by the automotive group. Sales of nondurable goods were up 1.6 per cent,

as the sales of the food group advanced 0.6 per cent and sales of
general merchandise 2.6 per cent. Total sales excluding automotive
and nonconsumer items were up about 1-1/2 per cent from the second
quarter average.

Unit auto sales. September sales of new domestic-type autos
were at a 10.2 million unit rate, 6 per cent above a month earlier but
3 per cent below last September's record. Sales were buoyed by an
exceptionally strong final 10 days when the 1973 models were introduced,
following a weak first 20 days. In all likelihood, the extremely
large number of deliveries in the last 10 days reflected orders posted
befoe official introduction but not reported at that time. Dealer
inventories were at a 41 day supply at the end of the month, a little
below August levels and 15 per cent below a year earlier.
Sales of imported cars in September were at a 1.6 million unit
rate, somewhat below August but 5 per cent above a year earlier. The
import share was 13 per cent as compared with 12 per cent in September
last year.

Retailers' purchases of durables. Data for the first three
weeks of September indicate that retailers' unit purchases of major
home appliances were lower than in August but above a year earlier.
All appliances in the index either remained equal to or declined from
August levels. Retailer purchases of TVs--including domestic label
imports--were down 3 per cent from August but well above a year earlier.
Radio purchases--almost all imports--were below both a month and a year
earlier.

Consumer credit. In August, the net expansion in consumer
credit outstanding under instalment and noninstalment contracts re-
bounded to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $20.4 billion. This
was equal to the previous high earlier this year. The upsurge in

I -12
growth of instalment credit brought its annual rate of increase for the
first eight months of 1972 more than 50 per cent above the rate for
the full year 1971. Growth last year was close to the earlier peak
in 1968.

Extensions and repayments for all major types of instalment
credit, except personal loans, were at record high seasonally adjusted
rates in August. Credit extensions for nonautomotive consumer goods were
elevated by continued strength in the market for conventional housing--
reflecting completions and sales of new dwellings and resales of existing
units--and in the mobile-home market. Extensions of auto credit, which
had declined in July after rising four months in a row, jumped to a new
high in August despite a drop in unit sales. The increase in auto credit
reflected, to some extent, the usual lag in contract placements after
exceptionally strong sales in the final 10-day period of July.

I -13
During the first eight months of 1972, total credit extended
for new and used automobiles was 15 per cent above the same period of
1971. In the market for new cars, which accounts for about two-thirds
of all auto credit, extensions have risen more than sales. The
disproportionate growth in credit relative to sales has reflected a
moderate increase in contract size, to an average of about $3,480
for new cars, and more important, a rise in the ratio of new cars
financed to new cars purchased. This ratio has averaged 68 per cent
so far this year, about 5 percentage points above last year's sub-
normal rate, and about in line with previous expansion periods. In-
creased utilization of credit has been stimulated by some easing of
non-rate loan terms, mainly less restrictive downpayment requirements.
Although automobile credit has been rising sharply, consumers,
benefiting from a strong rise in personal income, have experienced
little difficulty in meeting payments. The delinquency rate on bank
loans for new and used autos in August was little changed from a year
earlier, and delinquency rates at finance companies, while higher than
at banks, have declined considerably from a year ago.
At finance companies, average finance rates to consumers on
new car contracts have slipped to the lowest level (11.84 per cent)
reported since the monthly series originated in mid-1971. Rates on
used car contracts have edged up recently, but are still below year-
earlier levels. The new bimonthly series for finance companies showed

I -14
little change in rates on direct personal instalment loans between
March and July, and declines of more than 25 basis points on purchased
contracts for mobile homes and "other consumer goods." At commercial
banks, the most commonly charged rates on various types of direct
instalment loans to consumers leveled off in July and August after
declining as much as 25 basis points, in some cases, during the first
half of 1972.

Consumer surveys. The latest surveys by the Michigan Survey
Research Center and the Conference Board indicate a marked improvement
in consumer optimism. The Michigan index of sentiment for August-
September was 4.7 points higher than in May, for the third consecutive
quarterly gain; at 94.0 (Feb. 1966 = 100), the index has now about
made up the decline of 1969 and 1970. The July-August 1972 survey by
the Conference Board indicated very strong improvement from May-June
in both appraisals of the present situation and expectations for the
next 6 months; previous to this, expectations in this bi-monthly
survey have moved unevenly for a year or so.
Most of the increase in the Michigan index was attributable
to substantially more optimistic expectations about business conditions
in the next 12 months and next 5 years. More households also thought
that it was a good time to buy large household durables; the percentage
expressing such views were already at a very high level. There was a
slight decline in appraisals of present and future financial situations
but replies to this question were very favorable in the previous survey.
The percentage of households with favorable responses
increased by at least 2 percentage points for all five of the
attitudinal questions reported by the Conference Board; although it is
not unusual for the individual questions to change by this magnitude,
the fact that all of the questions improved together may have important
implications for future household expenditures on durable goods.
Thus, even though buying plans for autos and homes declined and there

I -16
was a slight improvement in purchase plans for major appliances, the
outlook seems good, because buying intention questions appear less
closely related to future durable goods expenditures than attitudinal
data.
Construction and real estate. Seasonally adjusted value of
new construction put in place rose further in September to a record
annual rate of $123 billion. Residential construction continued to
account for much of the rise. However, outlays for private non-
residential structures approximated the improved rate reached in
August despite a persistently low level of industrial plant building
so far this year. Public construction outlays also increased in
September, although the rise was concentrated entirely in federally
owned projects.
Prices of lumber and related materials have risen sharply
this year as expanded demands have continued to put additional pressure
on capacity. Even so, over-all construction costs have increased only
moderately and, in fact, in September they were still holding at last
summer's level, according to Census Bureau measures. The average was
4 per cent above a year earlier--about half of the year-to-year rise
reported for 1971 as a whole.
Seasonally adjusted private housing starts turned sharply
upward in August. The rise, which may be overstated because of
working-day adjustment difficulties, followed a two-month decline and
was to an annual rate of 2.46 million units, back almost to the record
first quarter pace. Although a decline most likely occured in September,

Manufacturers' orders and shipments. New orders for durable
goods rose 3.6 per cent (p) in August, more than erasing the July
decline and reaching a new high. Excluding the volatile defense
component, total new orders appear to be rising about as fast in the
third quarter as they did in the second, with particular strength in
primary metals and motor vehicles. Orders for capital goods (non-
defense) were still below the June high but above the second-quarter
average, and unfilled orders for these goods continued to increase.
The backlog of unfilled orders for total durable goods rose
a substantial 1.4 per cent in August, increasing for the eleventh
consecutive month, following two years of decline from mid-1969
through mid-1971. But, the increase in unfilled orders was less than
the increase in shipments, and the order backlog was only 2.55 months'
shipments in August, near the lowest point in two decades.

Cyclical indicators. The Census trend-adjusted composite
index of leading indicators rose a strong 2.2 per cent in August (p).
The changes in June and July were revised down somewhat, and for the
two months combined the change is now minus 0.1 per cent instead of
plus 0.8 per cent.
The coincident composite index continued to rise at a
relatively steady rate. The lagging composite index was revised down-
wards through May but upwards in June and July, reflecting mainly
revisions in actual and anticipated plant and equipment spending.
Virtually all leading series increased in August--the manu-
facturing workweek, (p) initial claims for unemployment insurance
(inverted), new orders for durable goods, housing permits, industrial

I -21
materials prices, common stock prices, and the ratio of price to unit
labor cost in manufacturing; contracts and orders for plant and
equipment was the only series to decline. The revisions and new data
so far available do not suggest major revision of the August change in
the leading index.

Of the leading indicator components for September available
so far, the monthly average of common stock prices was down but the
manufacturing workweek and industrial materials prices rose slightly.
Labor market. The labor market continued to strengthen in
September. Both payroll and total employment advanced by about a
quarter million and the civilian labor force rose by 200,000. Total
unemployment changed little, however, and State insured unemployment
also showed no significant change during the month.
Employment expansion slowed considerably during the early
summer months following the rapid gains of late 1971 and early 1972.
In the past two months, however, there has been a strong resurgence in
the growth of nonfarm payroll jobs. 1/ The August increase was revised

upward, and the gains in both August and September were well above
the monthly average of the preceding year. Manufacturing employment
advanced by nearly 90,000 in September as did the number of government
jobs. Employment gains in the private service-producing sector, while
sizable, were below the average monthly increase recorded earlier
in the year.
Average weekly hours of manufacturing workers rose by 0.1
hour in September to 40.7 hours--about the same level as in the prior
four months but 1.1 hour longer than in September 1971. Average over-
time, at 3.5 hours in September, was up 0.7 hour from a year earlier.

Unemployment and labor force. The unemployment rate edged
down by 0.1 percentage points in September to 5.5 per cent (seasonally
adjusted), returning to the July level. Jobless rates for most groups
showed little change, with only marginal declines occurring among adult
men and women. The Negro unemployment rate, however, rose to 10.2
per cent, moving the ratio of Nggro to white unemployment rates above

I -23
the historical 2 to 1 ratio. Overall, recovery in the unemployment
rate has been relatively slow; the third quarter jobless rate--at 5.6
per cent--was down 0.1 percentage point from the preceding quarter,
and only 0.4 percentage point below a year ago. Much of the decline in
unemployment since last year has been among men aged 20 years and over,
with smaller improvement for women aged 25 and over. In September,
unemployment among teenagers and younger women was not significantly
changed from a year earlier.

last half of 1971 and early 1972, the rate of growth slowed considerably
during the spring and early summer. In the past two months, however,
rapid labor force growth has resumed. The civilian labor force in

I -24
the third quarter was up by 2.2 million from a year earlier. Slightly
less than half the over-the-year increase occurred among adult women,
reflecting largely a rise in their participation rate. All of the
recent gains in the labor force and total employment have been among
part-time workers.
Earnings. Average hourly earnings of production workers
on private nonfarm payrolls (adjusted for overtime in manufacturing
and inter-industry shifts) have been rising at a relatively slow pace
since January and less than the Pay Board guidelines--4.6 per cent annual
rate as compared with a 6.5 per cent rate prior to August 1971. Pre-
liminary estimates indicate about a 4-1/2 per cent rate of increase in
September and for the third quarter. The slowing this year has been
most apparent in services and finance, and in the construction industry.
In manufacturing, wages of production workers have increased at a
5-1/4 per cent rate since January--somewhat less in the latest quarter.
Compared to a year earlier the hourly earnings index in
September was up 5.7 per cent, with above average increases in
transportation and public utilities, mining and manufacturing reflect-
ing sharp increases immediately following the end of the freeze.

Wholesale prices. Wholesale prices rose at a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 3.6 per cent from August to September--only
about half as fast as in the preceding three months. The rate of
increase slowed in both industrial commodities and farm and food
prices.
Favorable developments in September included a less than
seasonal rise in prices of consumer foods and a much reduced rise in
prices of industrial materials and producer finished goods. However
fuel prices continued to advance, accounting for one-third of the
rise in industrials, and prices accelerated for consumer goods outside
the food category.

From November through August, materials prices had continued
to rise at substantial rates--10.3 per cent annually for crude materials
and 4.4 per cent for intermediate materials. But last month crude
materials prices declined and intermediate materials prices increased
only slightly. Prices of hides and skins advanced little further,
although they are at levels twice as high as a year earlier, and plywood
prices dropped. Lumber prices continued to advance, however, and non-
ferrous metal prices rose, reflecting a rise in nickel.
Although construction materials prices have continued to
increase in Phase II, the rise has moderated considerably since last
year. The lumber and wood products component of the construction
materials index rose about 10 per cent over the year ending in August,
compared to 18 per cent in the preceding 12-month period. Other building
materials prices, more readily constrained by the stabilization program,
have risen only 1.5 per cent in the past year compared to 4.7 per cent
in the previous twelve months.
Food prices have been expected to decline about seasonally
this fall led by a decline in beef. The situation is uncertain,
however, since beef cattle prices have firmed after a sizable decline
in August.
As shown below, wholesale food prices have risen considerably
faster than retail prices over the past year, and especially in recent
months. Correspondingly, retail prices may be slow to move down in
response to decreases at wholesale.

Fresh vegetable prices, which fell much less than seasonally
because of short harvests, contributed significantly to the seasonally
adjusted advance in food prices in August. Meat prices rose somewhat
further. In September, however, beef prices were down more than
seasonally at wholesale, and also at retail according to Department
of Agriculture estimates based on its chainstore sample (preliminary,
not for publication). These estimates indicate a spread between farm
and retail prices for beef below the August peak but well above that
in November, 1971. Margins for pork, however, still appear low,
particularly for packers.
Among other commodities, gasoline and house prices registered
substantial advances as in July, again partially offset by more than
seasonal declines for apparel. New car prices declined less than
seasonally for the third consecutive month.
Agricultural developments. The index of prices received by
farmers was unchanged from August 15 to September 15. Higher prices
for milk, wheat, eggs, corn and grapefruit were offset by lower prices
for cattle, cotton and potatoes. However, cattle prices firmed in
late August, moving upward slightly during September and early October.
Hog prices were unchanged.
September red meat production, seasonally adjusted, was
unchanged from August. Beef production was up seasonally while
pork production was down 4 per cent.

I -31
Influenced by strong foreign demand, primarily from the
U.S.S.R., wheat and corn prices increased 15 per cent and 9 per cent,
respectively, during September, falling off somewhat late in the
month. Soviet corn purchases totaled 7 million tons by October 4,
higher than the expected 4 million tons. The Federal wheat export
subsidy to U. S. exporters was eliminated on September 22 since the
domestic price was determined to be competitive on the world market.
Agricultural Finance. Total farm debt is expected to increase
by $5.3 billion (8.5 per cent) during 1972, according to preliminary
USDA estimates. This rise, which approximates that of 1971, lies
between the relatively low annual increases of 6 to 7 per cent during
1968-70, when tight credit conditions depressed real estate transfer
activity, and the relatively high yearly increases of 9 to 12 per cent
that prevailed during the period 1962-67.
In 1971, farm-sector capital flows (real estate transfers,
capital expenditures, and inventory change) rose markedly from the level
of preceding years, due to a revival in farm land market activity, to
increased machinery purchases, and to large additions to crop and
livestock inventories. Although indebtedness rose as indicated above,
the proportion of capital flows financed by borrowing did not rise
appreciably. These trends appear to be continuing in 1972.

I --32
The relatively unchanged degree of reliance on internal
financing in the face of easier credit conditions may reflect the
favorable trend in farm income, as well as the likelihood that loan
interest rates, while down from previous peaks, still appear high to
many farmers.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL SITUATION
Market yields have generally fluctuated in a quite narrow
range since the last Committee meeting despite some further increase
in the Federal funds rate. Market yields had increased considerably
from mid-August to mid-September, a factor contributing to a general
increase in the prime rate by one-fourth of a percentage point to
5-3/4 per cent in early October.
The uneasiness that characterized financial markets a month
ago now seems to have dissipated as the technical position of bond
dealers has improved and as peace rumors became widespread. Government,
corporate, and municipal security dealers reduced their security holdings,
although there are market reports that more recently corporate and
municipal bond dealers are increasing their holdings of bonds acquired
in the secondary market in anticipation of a rally they expect to
follow announcement of a peace settlement in Vietnam.
Primary mortgage interest rates have shown little net change
recently, as inflows of consumer interest-bearing deposits to thrift
institutions and banks remained large while mortgage commitments con-
tinued at record levels. Consumer credit expansion also apparently
remained large in September after a record increase in August. However,
business loans at banks expanded only moderately, largely in reflection
of a surprisingly small volume of borrowing over the tax date as
corporations paid an unusually large volume of their September taxes
from their liquid assets holdings.
Outlook. The Treasury is expected to make large demands on
financial markets over the next six months, with the staff anticipating

II -2
about $10 billion of net cash borrowing in the current quarter followed
by $11 billion in the next quarter. These expanded financing needs
are likely to coincide with projected sizable growth in business loan
demands, thus exerting upward pressure on rates. Such pressures--
which are likely to be greater in short- and intermediate-term market
sectors, than in long-term--may be relatively modest in the immediate
weeks ahead, but are likely to increase over the quarter as non-bank
investors absorb a significant share of the new Treasury issues.
While commercial bank liquidity remains relatively high,
rising loan demands will not only limit bank participation in Treasury
financings, but could also lead to reduction in bank liquidity and a
continued high rate of CD sales. Both high CD sales and reduced holdings
of liquid assets would contribute to upward rate pressures in short-term
markets--particularly during the forthcoming period of large Treasury
financing demands.
In long-term markets, the volume of corporate and municipal
bonds coming to market is expected to decline. The cut-back in cor-
porate bond offerings expected this quarter is largely attributable to
the sharply reduced volume of industrial bond financing and reduced bond
issues by public utilities, which are expected to continue raising a
large share of their capital market needs in equity markets. The
general dampening of financing needs of State and local governments
appears to reflect their anticipation of revenue sharing, as well as
their improved financial positions. In the mortgage market, a seasonal
slackening in mortgage formation together with a continued large inflow
of funds to mortgage lenders should also contribute to relative rate

II -3
stability of primary mortgages, although rising short-term market rates
might lead to some further increase in mortgage rates in the secondary
market.
Monetary aggregates. Preliminary data indicate that M1 during
September grew at an annual rate of 5.5 per cent--the same as in August.
The pattern of developments within the two months, however, was noticeably
different. From late July through early September, M1 showed almost
persistent week-to-week expansion, but after the first week of September,
it declined absolutely. In fact, the level of M in the last week of
September was no higher than in the last week of August. The reasons
for the general weekness of M1 after early September are not clear,
although it may be attributed in part to the larger-than-expected
build-up in Government deposits. There is also some indication--
noted below--that large corporations relied more heavily than usual
on liquid assets, presumably including cash balances, to finance
September quarterly tax payments.
Even with the August-September slowdown, M1 is now estimated
to have expanded at an 8.5 per cent rate in the third quarter. For
the second and third quarters combined, M1 growth has been at a 6.9
per cent rate, and over the last year the increase has amounted to
6.2 per cent.
M2 rose at an 8.5 per cent rate in September, also about the
same as in August. Despite the recent rise in yields on market
instruments, growth in consumer type time and savings deposits continued
strong, though receding from the high rates experienced early this year.

Although there was an unusually large amount of maturing CD's
in September, the runoff over the tax period was smaller than had been
anticipated. As a result, the seasonally adjusted net increase in out-
standing CD's during September was about the same as in the previous
three months. Offering rates on large CD's have continued to rise since
mid-August in most maturity ranges--albeit more slowly after mid-September--
whereas other short-term market rates have leveled off.
The adjusted bank credit proxy grew at an 11 per cent annual
rate during September and the third quarter, approximately the same
rate as in the first half of the year. The September growth rate was
somewhat higher than in August, mainly reflecting the increase in
government deposits.
Bank credit. June call report data indicate that commercial
bank credit (last Wednesday of the month series) grew somewhat faster
during the first half of 1972 than previously estimated. Most of the
additional credit expansion was in real estate and business loans. Real
estate loans are now estimated to have increased at approximately a
19 per cent annual rate in the first and second quarters, and business
loans at an annual rate of 11 per cent in the first quarter and 8 per
cent in the second. 1/
During September, seasonally adjusted bank credit (last Wednesday
of the month series) grew more slowly than in August, reflecting almost
1/ Most of the upward revision in business loans in the second quarter
reflects a "miss" in staff estimates of window dressing on June 30.
For the months of June and December, the all commercial bank credit
series is as of June 30 and December 31; for other months it is as
of the last Wednesday of the month.

a Federal Reserve $800 million matched sale-purchase transaction on the

The slowdown in loan growth during September was concentrated
primarily in business loans and loans to nonbank financial institutions.
Consumer loans, which had expanded more rapidly in July and August than
in the first and second quarters, continued to show rapid growth through
September. All other major loan categories grew at about the same
rates in September as in August.
The slowdown in business loan growth in September appears to
reflect special factors associated in part with the unusually small
amount of tax borrowing by corporations. As can be seen in the table for
a tax date with no maturing tax bills, the aggregate of net CD runoffs
and business loan expansion during the September 1972 tax period was
low relative to total tax payments. As indicated earlier, corporations--
with their high liquidity--apparently financed an unusually large pro-
portion of their tax payments out of other financial assets, possibly
including cash balances. Since the September slowdown appears to be
a temporary aberation, perhaps a better indication of the underlying
strength of business loan demands is the 12 per cent annual rate of
increase in such loans over the third quarter as a whole.
In September, after two months of decline, bank holdings of
short term Government securities increased on a seasonally adjusted
basis. Our data do not permit identification of own account acquisi-
tions as opposed to purchases for inventories by dealer banks, but
the total increase in bank holdings is no doubt associated with a
significant expansion in the market supply of bills in late August and
early September. Acquisitions of municipals and other securities at
banks continued to rise during September at a rate only slightly below
that of August.

Nonbank financial institutions and mortgage market. Deposit flows
into nonbank thrift institutions were maintained at a substantial pace during
September, according to sample data. For the third quarter as a whole, the
rate of deposit growth appears about unchanged from the preceding quarter.
Moreover, despite the recent higher level of short-term interest rates,
preliminary data indicate that the savings institutions had a favorable
experience during the early days of the September-October reinvestment
period.
New mortgage commitments at S&L's rose sharply during
September and outstanding commitments also rose, according to pre-
liminary data. Even with the further increase in commitments, S&L's
continue to maintain a comfortable commitment-cash flow position, given
the strong deposit performance, record mortgage repayment flows, and

high liquidity positions. Borrowing from the FHLB's did pick up in
September, however, reflecting primarily an attractive advanced program
in the San Francisco District.

1/ The total of loan commitments held plus loans in process divided by
the total sources of funds in the preceding three months (the
current month and two previous months).
Due in large measure to the high sustained rate of savings
inflows, yields on home mortgages apparently edged up only slightly in
September in the secondary market, despite the further increase in the
demand for credit on residential properties. In the latest FNMA
auction (October 2) for forward purchase commitments on government-
underwritten home loans, the average yield edged up 4 basis points to 7.69
per cent. Although this level was higher than at any time since last
November, the FNMA commitment yield has risen on 7 basis points since
mid-year. The volume of bids received increased sharply in the last
auction as an increased number of mortgage bankers attempted to secure
FNMA commitments in order to hedge against anticipated further price
declines.

Despite growing concern about an additional rise in secondary
market yields in the period ahead, GNMA's price support program for
"nonsubsidized" government-insured residential mortgages should tend
to moderate any additional increase in the cost of credit paid by
qualified borrowers on FHA and VA loans.1/ With prices hovering around
95, this program--under which GNMA subsidizes the difference between
the secondary market price and its administratively established buying
price of 96 for new- and 95 for existing-home loans--should become
more active if further price declines occur.
One significant development in the mortgage market this year
has been the shift from fixed rate government-underwritten loans, many

of which qualify for the GNMA discount subsidy, to high loan-to-value
ratio conventional loans which carry going market rates. The market
trend to high-ratio conventional financing has been stimulated by loan
processing delays at FHA field offices, an abundance of funds for
conventional financing, and the regulatory liberalization of the maximum
size of conventional home loans at Federal savings and loan associations
beyond the limits on FHA loans.1/ Associated with this development has
been a sharp rise in underwriting on private mortgage insurance that
is required by FNMA and FHLBB on conventional loans with the highest
loan-to-value ratios. In August, Mortgage Guaranty Insurance Corporation,
the largest private mortgage insurer, reported receiving a record $871
million in applications for insurance on one- to four-family homes--
14 per cent more than in July and over twice the volume received a
year earlier. The shift to high-ratio conventional loans may be
further accelerated after FNMA begins to issue commitments on 95 per
cent conventional loans in mid-November.
1/ Federal savings and loan associations can now lend up to $30,000 on
95 per cent mortgages and to $45,000 on 90 per cent home loans.
FHA-insured (Section 203) mortgages, in contrast, run up to
$33,000 per unit on 1-family houses on which the loan-to-value
ratio is approxiately 92 per cent.

II -14
Short-term interest rates. Market yields on shorter-term U.S.
Treasury bills have increased moderately on balance since the September
FOMC meeting. A brief rally had developed in the latter part of
September, but this was more than offset by a backing up of rates in
recent days. A modest tightening of money market conditions, as re-
flected in a somewhat higher Federal funds rate and higher dealer
borrowing costs, has contributed to the upward pressures on bill rates.
also were
Supply factors/responsible, since the Treasury added $600 million to the
volume of 1-year bills in the late September auction. Dealers recently
have reduced their bill positions to what appear to be comfortable levels,
however, and this together with the Treasury's announcement of a two-year
note auction in mid-October--rather than a tax bill--has strengthened
the technical position of the market.
As is typically the case, private short-term rates have shown
less fluctuation than bill rates since the middle of September. The
rate on 90-119 day commercial paper increased from 5 to 5-1/8 per cent
on September 18 and moved up further to 5-1/4 per cent in early October.
Following the September advance in the commercial paper rate, several
banks with a floating prime rate raised their rates to 5-3/4 per cent.
Soon thereafter, most other banks also raised their prime rates to the
same level.
The Treasury announced on October 5 that it will auction
$2 billion of a 2-year 6 per cent note on October 11. Payment is scheduled
for October 19, with full tax and loan credit allowance. The Treasury
said that it probably will sell similar type issues at quarterly intervals
over the rest of the current fiscal year.

In contrast, tax-exempt yields declined about 15 basis points
since the last Committee meeting, bringing rates back to the mid-August
level. Some moderation in the volume of new issues and a pick-up in
buying by casualty companies in recent weeks have benefited this market.
Yields on intermediate and long-term Treasury securities have
fluctuated within a narrow range since the preceding FOMC meeting. Rates
on longer-term securities are up on balance about 5 basis points, but
the Treasury bond market has been in a strong technical position over
this period. Dealers have reduced their net short positions in inter-
mediate-and longer-term issues. In addition, foreign central banks,
Treasury trust accounts, and recently the Federal Reserve System have
added to their holdings of Treasury coupon issues by more than $350 million.
Stock prices have shown no sustained trend since mid-August.
In early October, most major stock price indices were little changed
from the level prevailing two months earlier. Trading volume, on average,
has been relatively light, averaging 12.3 million shares daily on the
NYSE in September--a drop of one-fifth from August.

Corporate public bond offerings dropped to a three-year low
in September. The mid-month rise in rates apparently caused some
deferral in filings, and total volume for the month was only about
$850 million. However, over $1.8 billion is now scheduled for October.
Of this total, one-third represents issues by finance companies, which
apparently need to raise more long-term capital in view of the large
rise in their holdings of consumer loans. But public utilities
continue to substitute stock offerings for proposed debt issues andT, -4.. 2/

this industry, which usually accounts for one-third to one-half of public
bond volume, has scheduled less than $250 million of debt issues for
November. Underwriters continue to report that industrial corporations
have limited current plans to issue long-term debt. Staff estimates
are that November public bond volume will be less than $1 billion.
A decline in the number of prospective borrowers appears to
have slowed down the pace of takedowns in the private placement market,
but new equity offerings are still being made at a rate of more than
$1 billion a month, a trend which is likely to continue over the fourth
quarter.

Municipal long-term debt offerings edged downward in September

originally scheduled for October. The staff estimates that the October
total will be about $1.8 billion, which includes a $300 million New York
offering and several large revenue issues. Given the strong current
revenue picture for most units and the prospective receipt of revenue-
sharing funds, many governments apparently have relatively low immediate
needs for financing. Further moderation of the volume of general
obligation issues is expected in the fourth quarter.
Federal finance. The current staff estimate of the budget
deficit for fiscal 1973 is $30.5 billion, $1.5 billion less than that
in the preceding Greenbook. This is the net result of a $2 billion down-
ward revision in expenditures and a $.5 billion reduction in projected
receipts based on an apparent shortfall of corporate taxes in September.
The new total of $255 billion for outlays allows for a $2 billion
reduction in estimated defense spending for the fiscal year, based on
lower than anticipated average monthly defense outlays in the third
quarter, and the fact that committees in both the House and Senate have
passed defense appropriation bills providing for less money than
requested by the Administration. While a sizable backlog of orders
is expected to result in an increase of defense spending over the balance
of the fiscal year, recovery of all of the third quarter's shortfall is
unlikely.
Pending legislation in non-defense areas could lead to higher
levels of spending than we have projected, but there may be offsetting
pressures in the form of a spending ceiling or the impounding of funds
by the Administration. The additional spending implied by pending

II -20
legislation is in the areas of veterans' education, water pollution
control, social security-medicare, and social service grants. If the
rigid $250 billion spending ceiling, recently passed by the House, is
enacted, outlays for fiscal year 1973 would be a good deal lower than
now projected without such a ceiling, but this may be accomplished in
part by a shifting of expenditures into fiscal 1974 through postpone-
ments as well as bookkeeping devices.
The projected pattern of revenue-sharing underlying the current
expenditure estimate provides for outlays of $2.65 billion in October
and again in January (representing retroactive payments for the January-
June and July-December periods), and a quarterly payment of about
$1.5 billion in April. This pattern differs from that used in the last
Greenbook, which assumed a $4 billion payment in October and monthly
payments thereafter. However, it is consistent with the flexibility
in the timing of payments permitted by law.
The end-of-September Treasury cash balance was $9.8 billion.
This was only $.3 billion above that projected in the September
Greenbook, because the shortfalls in receipts and expenditures tended
to be partly offsetting. After allowing for the recently announced
$2 billion issue of two-year notes as well as the $.6 billion addition
to yearly bills scheduled for the end of October, the Treasury's remain-
ing gross cash needs are estimated to be $9 billion for the rest of the
calendar year. The next major borrowing is expected to take place in
mid-November when $1.3 billion of outstanding coupon issues will mature.
In addition to rolling over these maturities the Treasury is expected

II -21
to raise several billion dollars of new money at that time in a cash
refinancing. Prior to the mid-November financing, the Treasury cash
balance is expected to decline substantially. Still further cash
borrowing will be needed in early December, and may take the form of
tax anticipation bills. Borrowing in the first quarter of calendar
year 1973 is forecasted to be $11 billion; this unusually large amount
reflects the (assumed) second retroactive revenue-sharing payment,
and the payment of about 40 per cent of the enlarged personal tax refund
in prospect for next year.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
Summary and outlook. Improved market sentiment about the
dollar since the calming of speculative activity after mid-July has
carried through into the early weeks of October, following the generally
amicable annual meeting of the IMF. The dollar strengthened in most
exchange markets in August and September; only the yen was under
upward pressure on the strength of prospects that there may ultimately
be another revaluation of the yen. The improvement in market attitudes
was no doubt a major factor in a turnaround in the over-all U.S.
balance. It appears that there was an official settlements surplus
of some $3/4 billion in the four weeks ending October 4, compared to
deficits of $5.1 billion in July and $1.1 billion in August (data
not seasonally adjusted).
Flows of short-term private capital through banking channels
have contributed to this recent strength in the over-all balance.
Claims on foreigners reported by U.S. banks, which advanced sharply
in July, rose very little in August. Liabilities of the U.S. agencies
and branches of foreign banks to bank offices abroad rose considerably
in August and September.
The over-all liquidity balance, which does not count the
increases in these bank liabilities as inflows "above-the-line," will
probably show a moderate deficit in September, after a deficit of
nearly $2 billion in August.

III -2
There have also been some helpful developments in
identifiable elements of the current and long-term capital accounts.
The most important factor for the long run was a slight narrowing of
the trade deficit in August to an annual rate of $6.4 billion --
about in line with projections of slow improvement in the period
ahead. Another significant development has been an upsurge of
foreign investment in U.S. corporate securities. In August, net
foreign purchases of U.S. corporate stocks rebounded strongly after
a period of only minor inflows since March. Also, sales of new issues
in foreign markets by U.S. corporations have been rising -- especially
in the form of convertible issues -- and were exceptionally large in
September; the proceeds of such issues are used mainly for direct
investment abroad, enabling corporations to carry through investment
plans with less U.S. funds. For their part, American investors were
net sellers of foreign corporate stocks in August.
While recent developments are encouraging, the outcome in
the period ahead continues to depend to a large extent on favorable
capital flows offsetting large current account deficits. In capital
markets abroad interest rates have been fairly stable in recent
months, generally at levels above the lows of the first quarter,
and some further rises may be generated by rising economic activity
and inflationary pressures. The recent move to a more restrictive
policy in Germany indicates the likely tendency of monetary policy

III -3
in most European countries. If interest rates abroad should begin
to move up relative to those in the United States the support to
the U.S. balance of payments that has come from interest-sensitive
capital flows during most of the period since mid-March could
sooner or later be lost. Renewed weakening of the balance could
be accentuated by confidence factors; despite improvement in
September, forward quotations for the dollar against some continental
European currencies continue to give evidence of market uneasiness
about prospects.
Foreign exchange and Euro-dollar markets. The recovery
of the dollar in the exchange markets, which had begun around mid-
July, accelerated in late September following the release of U.S.
trade figures for August and Secretary Shultz's proposals at the
IMF meetings for reform of the international monetary system. The
trend was interrupted on October 2 when the Swiss National Bank sold
$208 million dollars (at a rate for the Swiss franc about one percent
above par) and the market interpreted this action as indicating that
several other European central banks might take the opportunity to
sell dollars. (The National Bank of Belgium, pursuant to an agreement
among the EEC central banks, did sell a nominal amount of dollars,
and the German Federal Bank has indicated to us -- but not to the
market -- that it is also prepared to sell dollars at an "appropriate"
time.) When the Bundesbank raised its lending rates on October 6, the

III -4
dollar eased a bit further, but subsequently has rebounded on the
basis of increased speculation on a Vietnam settlement.
While continental currencies eased against the dollar in
recent weeks, the Japanese yen has remained hard at its upper limit
with the Bank of Japan purchasing large amounts of dollars ($700
million in September, $470 million in the first 11 days of October.)
Events at the Fund meetings and developments in Japan seem to have
increased expectations of another yen revaluation, and forward yen
quotes have strengthened sharply since late September. Yen for
delivery in December is currently quoted at nearly a 2 percent
(absolute) premium over the spot upper limit; for April delivery,
6 percent.
Sterling, after having held remarkably steady around $2.44
to $2.45 since mid-July, weakened sharply ahead of the IMF meetings
on rumors of an imminent return to a fixed parity. Subsequently,
the uncertainty over Norway's and Denmark's entry into the EEC and
the Trades Unions Conference's rejection of the Heath Government's
proposal for a "voluntary" incomes policy combined to push sterling
even lower. It is currently quoted at about $2.42.
The Danish krone came under heavy selling pressure in late
September after the Norwegian referendum rejected Norway's entrance
into the EEC, and, on September 26, the Danish central bank withdrew
from the market until after the Danish referendum on October 2.

III -5
(The Prime Minister had warned that the Danish currency would have
to be devalued if Denmark did not join the EEC.) In the next few
days the krone was thinly traded below its lower limit, but,
following the Danish "yes' vote in the referendum, the krone
firmed sharply to above its central rate and the central bank
resumed exchange market operations. On October 3 the Danish
discount rate was lowered from 8 to 7 percent, and on October 10
Denmark announced its intention to return to the EEC narrow margins.
In the Euro-dollar market the overnight rate moved higher
over the past month along with the Federal funds rate. The
differential in favor of borrowing reserve-free overnight Euro-dollars
in recent weeks has varied from 1/4 to 1/2 percent. The one-month
Euro-dollar rate has remained virtually unchanged and equal to the
one-month CD rate at 5 percent since mid-September, while the three-
month Euro-dollar rate, after a jump at end-September has been
near 6 percent in recent weeks, exceeding the comparable CD rate
by about 2/3 percent.
U.S. bank's liabilities to their foreign branches have
continued to show little change over the past month, remaining at
about the level of their Regulation M reserve-free bases. However,
over the four-week period ended October 4, liabilities of U.S.
agencies and branches of foreign banks to foreign commercial banks
have increased by about $1.4 billion.

Balance of payments. Following the end of the speculative
flurry against the dollar in mid-July the official settlements
balance improved markedly, probably registering a surplus on the
order of $3/4 billion in the four weeks ending October 4. This
shift to the better, from deficits of $5.1 billion in July and
$1.1 billion in August (not seasonally adjusted) is attributable

III -7
in large part to the relaxation of anxiety about the dollar generated
by the actions taken before and during the annual IMF meeting to
indicate support for the Smithsonian rates and initiatives in
settling the issues of monetary reform and balance-of-payments
adjustments. Also important, however, were the signs of some
gains in the U.S. trade account (discussed below) and developments
in capital markets that supported a flow of private capital to the
United States.
An increased flow of foreign capital to the United States
is indicated by the data for liquid liabilities to private foreigners
and for transactions in U.S. securities. U.S. banks reported an
increase of over $700 million in liabilities to private foreigners
(mainly foreign commercial banks) in August, and in the five weeks
ended October 4, there was a further increase of over $1 billion.
These borrowings, largely by U.S. agencies and branches of foreign
banks, reflect the hardening of short-term interest rates in the
U.S. relative to those in the Euro-dollar market since July.
The overall liquidity balance, which counts these volatile
flows below the line, registered a sizable deficit in August ($2.0
billion) and was probably still in deficit in September as the
unfavorable balance on goods and services, remittances, and
Government capital flows continued to exceed inflows of nonliquid
private capital.

III -8
Capital flows connected with transactions in securities
have been favorable recently. Foreign net purchases of U.S.
corporate stocks moved up sharply to $240 million in August, after
averaging about $30 million per month in the April-July period.
In addition, as detailed on pp III-13-16, U.S. corporations have been
able to sell substantial amounts of convertible bonds in foreign markets,
relieving pressure on the U.S. balance of payments to the extent they
substitute these funds for U.S.-source funds for direct investment
abroad or employ them in the United States. This resurgence of interest
in U.S. corporate securities in this period is probably associated
with the generally stronger performance of the U.S. economy and the
ebbing of speculation on further exchange rate changes. Possibly
for similar reasons, American investors sold foreign corporate
stocks on balance in August.
Foreign lending by U.S. banks was responsible for only a
small outflow in August, and probably also in September,compared to
an outflow of $750 million in July. At this date there is no
information available on the behavior of direct-investment flows in
the third quarter. Some increase in outflows by U.S. corporations
for direct investment abroad over the extremely low rate of the
second quarter has been expected, but heavy borrowing abroad, coupled
with a considerable decline in the rate at which the companies are
expanding their foreign plant and equipment expenditures, may be

III -9
holding down the flow of corporate funds from the United States.
Similarly, the actions taken by the Japanese authorities to make
dollars available to their banks and business enterprises may be
sustaining a further inflow of direct investment capital to the
United States, as well as supporting other sectors of the capital
account.
U.S. foreign trade. In August, the U.S. trade deficit was
at an annual rate of $6-1/4 billion, (balance of payments basis),
down moderately from the deficit rates of almost $7 billion in each
of the preceding 3 months. Exports in August were nearly 5 percent
above July, while imports rose less strongly. The July-August
deficit rate of $6-3/4 billion was about in line with our current
projections for the third quarter, although the levels of both exports
and imports were higher than anticipated.
The August trade movements were distorted by current and
earlier foreign work stoppages -- the strike by Japanese seamen during
June and July and longshoremen's strikes in the U.K. and at British
Columbia ports in August. Possibly both exports and imports in August
were inflated. Movements of certain commodity groups were clearly
affected by these stoppages. Total imports from Japan in August
were about 5 percent higher than during April and May, before the
seamen's strike became fully effective. Imports of finished
manufactures, particularly automobiles and other consumer goods from
Japan, were up sharply in August, recovering from the dip in June

III -10
and July. The heavy inflow of cars from Japan was probably used
to replenish some of the inventories drawn down during the period
of the Japanese strike. Imports of industrial materials, which has
been rising strongly in the last several months, fell in August.
One of the explanations for this is that imports of lumber from Canada
were sharply reduced as a result of the dock strike in Vancouver.
Another reason for the drop of imports of industrial materials in
August was a steep decline in nickel imports from Canada as the
refinery there shut down for vacations for the first time in history.
Petroleum imports also dipped, but this decline is expected to be
short-lived in view of the further relaxation in import quotas which
will allow larger imports in the fourth quarter of this year.
On the export side, shipments of industrial materials
rose quite strongly in August as deliveries of coal and lumber to
Japan picked up significantly with the ending of the Japanese seamen's
strike. The major increase in exports in August, however, was in
shipments of automotive equipment to Canada, most of which will be
returned to United States at a higher value in the form of completed
cars. Shipments of agricultural products held at the high July level;
greater shipments of grain to the U.S.S.R. were offset by decline in
exports of other agricultural commodities. Only a small portion --
less than 5 percent -- of the grain contracted for by the U.S.S.R.
was shipped through August. The acceleration of deliveries under
the Russian grain agreement, along with additional heavy purchases of

III -11
grain by other countries, should serve to boost U.S. agricultural
exports, (now running at an annual rate of $9.5 billion) to a rate of
over $10 billion a year in the last part of this year. This compares
with agricultural exports last year of about $8 billion.
The divergent movement of import and export prices (unit
values) continues to be a factor in sustaining the trade deficit at
a high level. Import prices rose quite sharply in August, while
export unit values fell steeply.
Most of the rise in import prices was in foodstuffs (coffee,
fish) and in industrial materials (lumber, steel, petroleum). Prices
of finished goods rose also, but more moderately. With little
improvement expected in food supplies, prices of imported food-
stuffs are likely to rise further in the immediate future. In the
case of finished goods, there may be a more rapid advance in import
prices as economic activity rises here and abroad. It should be
noted that even though import unit values of finished goods have
been rising much more rapidly than export unit values this year,
they have not been rising faster than in the past few years.
The largest drop in export prices in August was in
finished manufactures, more than offsetting rises in foods (rice)
and industrial supplies (coal). With the elimination of the
export subsidy on wheat exports, which was as much as $.47 per
bushel at the end of August, there may be a very strong rise in the
export prices of wheat once current contractual obligations are fulfilled.

III -12
Long-term interest rates abroad. Although long-term bond
yields in major industrial countries abroad, and in the Euro-bond
market, are down from peak levels attained in 1970, yields in some of
these markets have been rising since early this year. Much of the de-
cline from 1970 peaks has been reversed in Germany and Canada, and
virtually all of it in the United Kingdom. In these three countries
and in France, yields now show smaller drops from the 1970 peaks than
do long-term yields in the United States, and this is also true for
yields on U.S. companies' dollar Euro-bond issues. In contrast, bond
yields in Italy and Japan have declined more since 1970 than U.S.
yields.
In all the major bond markets except the Japanese, yields
now are above cyclical lows touched in 1967 or 1968, generally by wide
margins. The differential is about three percentage points in Britain,
two points in Germany and Canada--substantially more than for long-term
yields as a whole in the United States--and somewhat under one percent-
age point in France and Italy. As in the United States, the two
principal explanations for today's higher yields are an inflation
premium and a high volume of new issues.
It is unlikely that yields in any of the major markets will
fall in the foreseeable future, and in Germany and Japan increases
appear probable. Factors currently putting upward pressure on yields
abroad are the prospects for more vigorous economic growth in Europe
and Japan (and further rapid expansion in Canada), continuing high
new issue volume in many markets, and the likelihood of little if any
reduction in rates of inflation.

III- 13
The Euro-bond market. New issue volume on the Euro-bond
market was at record highs in the second and third quarters, and
exceeded year-earlier amounts by very wide margins. For the first
nine months of this year new issues totalled about $4.5 billion
(September figures being estimated), an amount two-thirds greater
than in the comparable period last year.

Both U.S. corporations and non-U.S. borrowers have greatly
stepped up their recourse to the Euro-bond market in 1972. Non-U.S.
borrowers raised $2.9 billion in the market in the first nine months,
50 per cent more than a year earlier, as private companies, governments,

III -14
and international organizations increased their takings while state
enterprises' offerings were little changed. New flotations by U.S.
corporations, at $1.5 billion, were almost double last year's volume,
and made up 35 per cent of total new issues. Nearly all of the
increase in U.S. companies' issues has been in the form of convertible
bonds. U.S. companies issued convertible Euro-bonds on a large scale
in 1968-69, but very few in 1970-71. This year, when foreign demand
for U.S. equities has strengthened, convertibles have comprised over
one-half of total U.S. company Euro-bond issues. The convertibility
feature has been sufficiently attractive that, in the second and third
quarters, well-known U.S. firms could borrow at 4 to 5 per cent with
convertibles compared with yields ranging from 7-1/2 to 8-1/4 per cent
on most straight debt dollar issues. There has not been much change
this year in the volume of U.S. companies' straight debt issues.
There appear to be several reasons for the surge in U.S.
company bond issues. Some of the borrowing that has occurred this
year probably would have occurred last year in the absence of the
international monetary crisis, which made it harder to float dollar
issues. There were also expectations that as part of a monetary
settlement, and in accordance with repeated pledges, OFDI regulations
would be liberalized. With generally calmer exchange markets this
year, and the decision early last spring not to liberalize the OFDI
regulations, U.S. companies have entered the Euro-dollar market with
a backlog of financing demands. There are indications that some of the
Euro-bond proceeds are being used to replace shorter term debt.

III -15
Another stimulus to U.S. company Euro-bond issues seems to
be an expectation that conditions in the market are likely to be less
favorable in the foreseeable future than they are at present, so that
some amount of borrowing in advance of needs is taking place. In
addition, it is reported that some companies have been issuing Euro-
bonds partly to widen the market for their securities, even though
they could raise funds more cheaply in the U.S. bond market.
In terms of currency of issue, U.S. dollar issues comprised
56 per cent of total Euro-bond issues in the first nine months of 1972
and German mark issues another 19 per cent, these shares being little
changed from last year. The main new feature concerning currency
denomination of bonds has been the large volume of French franc bonds,
which were not allowed by the French authorities until last autumn.
So far this year French franc bonds, which have been issued by both
French and non-French borrowers, have accounted for almost 10 per cent
of overall new issue volume.
Yields on straight debt issues in 1972 have been lower than
at nearly all times in 1971, and are well down from peak levels
attained in the spring and summer of 1970. However, yields on straight
debt dollar issues have come down much less than yields on German mark
issues. Measured from average levels in the second and third quarters
of 1970, secondary market yields on dollar issues of U.S. corporations
have declined only about 65 basis points, compared with 130 basis points

III -16
on U.S. corporations' German mark bonds. A yield differential of this
type has existed for a long time, but it has widened sharply in 1972
and is greater than at any time since just before the floating of the
mark in September 1969. At the end of August the composite yield on
10 U.S. corporation dollar issues in the secondary market was 8.0 per
cent compared with 6.5 per cent on 10 mark issues. The present wide
differential reflects investors' expectations that the exchange value
of the mark is more likely to be maintained, or to appreciate, than
is that of the dollar.
Since the peaks attained in middle months of 1970 there has
also been a smaller decline in yields on straight debt dollar Euro-bonds
of U.S. corporations than on domestic U.S. corporate bonds. Again as
measured from the average of the second and third quarters of 1970, the
aforementioned decline of 65 basis points in Euro-bond yields compares
with a drop of a full percentage point in Moody's Aaa composite corporate
bond yield. The recent experience of one U.S. company that floated new
dollar issues simultaneously in the U.S. and the Euro-bond markets
indicates that borrowing in the Euro-bond market is about one-half
per cent more expensive.

III -17
Long-term interest rate developments in foreign countries.
In several of the major countries, notably the United Kingdom, Canada
and Germany, long-term bond yields, which have been rising during
most of 1972, are at fairly high levels, although still below (or
not above) previous peaks. The current high levels, however, have
been attained despite accommodating monetary policy and lagging
private investment demand. In France and Italy, long-term rates
have been falling during 1972, but remain substantially above the
lows of the past five years. In contrast to the experience of the
other countries, Japanese rates are low by historical standards, and
have declined this year.
Since the mid-1960's, a secular upward trend of long-term
rates is observable in most of the countries, excluding Japan. It
appears that to some extent a ratchet effect has been operative: in-
creases in yields in periods of higher economic activity exceed
reductions in subsequent periods of lower activity. Among the factors
accounting for this development are: conversion of short- to long-
term debt, inflation, and a general increase in demand for long-term
funds. In addition, yields in a particular country are closely
linked to those in other countries through interest rate movements,
anticipated and actual, in other countries and in the Euro-dollar
market.
Long-term interest rates in Germany (as reflected in the
average yield on bonds with a 6 per cent coupon) rose through July

III -18
1972, but have stabilized since at 7.65 per cent. For the immediate
future, the outlook is for a further rise in long-term rates, es-
pecially since the authorities seem determined to moderate the ex-
pansion of the money supply.
Rates are down a little more than 1/2 of one per cent from
the June 1970 peak of 8.3 per cent. And the low earlier this year
(February) was nearly two percentage points above the low of four
years ago.
The relatively high levels of long-term interest rates over
the past year -- at a time when short-term interest rates have fallen
sharply in response to the easing of monetary policy and the inflow
of foreign funds can be attributed in some measure to the conversion
of short- to long-term debt. (The Bardepot law may also have
contributed to the increase in rates since last winter.) New issues
of fixed-interest securities in Germany were exceptionally heavy during
the first quarter of 1972: industrial issuers returned to the market
although private investment demand showed no signs of revival and
public authorities borrowed heavily. Thus, for the first six months
of the year new issues totalled almost as much as they did during
all of 1971, leading the authorities to ration access to the market.
The recent acceleration in the rate of inflation in Germany
and the probable expectation that it will continue to be worse than
in the past may contribute to future increases in long-term rates.

III -19
For the future, an increase in the public sector's share in total
output -- a program to which the current government is committed --
may exert further upward pressure on long-term rates to the extent
that it implies rising borrowing requirements.
Bond yields in France (according to the Bank of France
composite yield on public sector bonds) were 7.8 per cent in mid-
September, almost one percentage point below the peak level (adjusted
to gross yield basis) of March 1970. However, yields are now
still well above their previous low of approximately 7 per cent in
the summer of 1967.
One important factor accounting for the higher yields now
compared with the low point approximately five years ago is the
large increase in new issue volume. Total gross new issues of bonds
and stocks in 1971, at 30 billion francs, were about double the
levels of 1966 and 1967 with both private and public sectors con-
tributing to the increased demand for funds. The higher inflation
rate of 5-1/2 per cent per annum in 1967-1971 compared with 3-1/2
per cent in 1959 to 1967, also contributed to the rise in yields.
The drop in yields since early 1970 has not been a steady
one but was in fact concentrated in two short periods, February to
July 1970 and January to July 1972. The latter was directly related
to various steps taken in the first half of this year to ease monetary
conditions. The probability of somewhat more rapid economic expansion

III -20
next year coupled with the government's pessimistic official price
projections suggest that the decline in yields may have come to an end.
Long-term interest rates in the United Kingdom (as represented
by the yield on 3-1/2 per cent War Loan) have been moving upward almost
uninterruptedly during 1972 from 8.32 per cent in January to 9.65 per
cent in September. The upward move of long-term yields this year has
brought them close to their end of 1970 peak of 9.8 per cent. There
was clearly a secular increase in long-term rates from 1966 through
the end of 1970, with rates rising by about three percentage points
over that period.
Upward price and wage movements, industrial disputes, and
external developments -- and the inflationary expectations which these
factors have generated -- have played a key role in the behavior of
United Kingdom long-term interest rates in recent years. Indeed, the
recent behavior of long-term rates can be largely attributed to an
intensification of inflationary expectations this year after some
moderation last year. Therefore, the future movements of long-term
rates as the economic recovery proceeds depend especially on factors
such as the success of the government's incomes policy. Greater
restraint on the part of the Bank of England in its support of the
government bond market, at a time when the government borrowing require-
ment is expected to be extraordinarily large, has been a further factor
pushing up long-term rates.

III -21
The demand for funds does not appear to have played a crucial
role in the upward movement of long-term rates. Reversing a long period
of budgetary deficits, the public sector was in surplus in 1969 and
1970 and net capital issues by United Kingdom companies were unusually
low in 1970, yet at that time the trend in long-term rates was upward.
Long-term interest rates in Italy (composite bond yield) have
declined steeply since July 1970. At the present (July) level of 7.23
per cent, the yield is 220 basis points under the peak, but still con-
siderably higher (65-90 basis points) than its level in the 3-1/2 year
period of stability that ended in mid-1969.
The steep decline in yields from 1970 to the present followed
a period of extraordinarily rapid increase during the 1969-70 monetary
tightening. Yields have been brought down by the shift to a policy of
monetary ease that occurred late in 1970 when it became apparent that
aggregate demand was not expanding. Demand has continued to lag since.
Consequently monetary policy has continued to be easy in an effort to
revive depressed investment spending.
One important factor holding up present yields as compared to
pre-1969 yields has been an enormous upsurge in new issues. In 1971
the volume of net new stock and bond issues was 70 per cent greater than
in 1968. Bond issues by the Treasury and the special credit institutes,
as well as stock issues, account for nearly all of the rise in new issue
volume.

III -22
The Bank of Italy believes that expectations of inflation
affect bond yields. Since 1969, Italian consumer prices have been
rising at a 5 per cent annual rate compared with 3.5 per cent in the
period 1955-1969, and this experience may well have had the effect of
making investors more inflation conscious.
Long-term interest rates in Canada (as reflected by the long-
term government of Canada bond average) rose from the beginning of 1972
through July and then leveled off in August and September at about
7.5 per cent -- down three-quarters of one percentage point from the
historical high reached in January 1970. In December 1971, the yield
reached a low of 6.54 per cent, about 150 basis points higher than
the levels in early 1965 and 100 basis points above the 1967 low.
The sharp decline in long-term yields in late 1970 was caused
primarily by a large increase in the money supply in the spring of 1970
to bring the economy out of recession. Since late 1971 monetary policy
has been cautiously expansionary. The aims of policy have been to
encourage economic growth (and thereby reduce unemployment) and to
discourage capital inflows in an attempt to keep the exchange rate of
the Canadian dollar down.
Inflation and inflationary expectations appear to be signifi-
cant factors explaining the large rise in yields since seven years ago.
For example, from 1961 to 1967 consumer price increases averaged 1.6
per cent per year, but the average from 1966 to 1971 rose to 3.7 per
cent, and in 1969 to 4.5 per cent.

The demand for funds also appears to have played an important
role in the upward shift of yields. Public sector demand for Canadian
long-term funds has been substantial over the past several years. Long-
term private borrowing rose sharply in 1970-71, partially reflecting
efforts to lengthen the term structure of debt. As the Canadian economy
continues through the early stages of cyclical expansion, and in
addition, as the government continues to urge provinces to avoid
recourse to foreign markets, the demand for Canadian funds should con-
tinue to be strong.
Long-term interest rates in Japan (as reflected by the yield
on Class A seven-year industrial bonds) are now at what appear to be
low levels by historical standards. The latest figure for July 1972
is 6.52 per cent, compared to a high of 8.89 per cent in April 1970.
The previous low in August 1968 was 7.99 per cent, but this was at a
time when government controls were preventing yields from fluctuating
freely. One reason for the low long-term yields is that short-term
interest rates are at their lowest postwar level. Even with the fall
in long-term yields, the spread between short and long rates has widened.
As the demand for funds picks up with the economic recovery, rates
are likely to move up once more. In fact, they probably reached their
cyclical low this summer.
