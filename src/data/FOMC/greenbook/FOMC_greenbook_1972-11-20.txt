Prefatory Note  
 
 
The attached document represents the most  complete and accurate version available 
based on original copies culled from the f iles of the FOMC Secretariat at the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve Syst em.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization proce ss which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain. 
 Please note that some material may have b een redacted from this document if that 
material was received on a confidential ba sis.  Redacted material is indicated by

1  In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic 
format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to rem ove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing). 
 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optical character recognition computer program (OCR) 
first created electronic text from the document im age.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, 
staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.  Pl ease note that the numbers and text in charts and 
tables were not reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff.

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
The pace of economic expansion appears to have accelerated in
recent months and staff projections indicate a rise in real GNP at an
annual rate of 7.5 per cent this quarter, compared to 6 per cent (or
perhaps a little more after the forthcoming revision) in the third
quarter. All major demand categories, except for residential construc-
tion, are expected to increase more rapidly in the fourth quarter than
in the third, with the largest gains expected in consumer spending and
inventory investment. Federal defense purchases are projected to rise
moderately following a sharp decline in the third quarter.
Heightened demands have been accompanied by sizable gains in
industrial production and employment. Industrial output increased by
almost 1 per cent in October, with advances widespread among consumer
goods, business equipment, and materials. From July to October, the
rise in the index was at an annual rate of 10 per cent. Gains in non-
farm employment were substantial in October, for the third consecutive
month, with manufacturing contributing appreciably to the overall rise.
However, the unemployment rate in October remained at 5.5 per cent as
the labor force also increased strongly.
Consumer spending recently has been especially expansive.
Retail sales were up almost 3 per cent in October according to the
advance report, following the September decline. Unit sales of domestic-
type autos have remained strong through early November. Recent surveys
of consumer attitudes and buying intentions indicate an upsurge in opti-
mism. Housing starts were still at an exceptionally high level in
September.

I -2
The business sector also has been strong. Book value of in-
ventories increased considerably further in September, and for the third
quarter as a whole the increase was almost half again larger than in
the second quarter. Sales were also up sharply, and stock sales ratios
remained at the lowest levels in a number of years. Manufacturers' new
orders for durable goods rose further in September, as did unfilled
orders. The recent McGraw-Hill survey of business plans to spend for
plant and equipment indicates a rise of 11 per cent for 1973, with a
sharper gain in prospect for manufacturing.
Wage increases have been larger in recent months than earlier.
However, the rise in wholesale prices slowed in October to an annual
rate of only 1 per cent. The rise in prices of farm products and foods
moderated considerably and industrial prices were virtually unchanged,
primarily because of a decline in prices of autos and trucks associated
with quality improvements in the new models. Consumer prices increased
rapidly in September, reflecting continued sharp advances for food and
a sizable rise for other commodities.
Outlook. Staff expectations, as before, are for continuing
strong expansion in the economy in the remainder of this year. For
1973, also, our projections are relatively little changed overall from
five weeks ago, following a thorough review of the underlying statistics
and despite modifications in some major assumptions.
Specifically, we no longer assume expiration of the price-wage
controls program at the end of April, but rather continuation of a
reasonably effective program throughout the year. Also, the current GNP

I-3
projection assumes Federal expenditures of $253 billion in fiscal 1973
on a unified budget basis, well below the projection of five weeks ago
but still somewhat above the Administration's target. Third, we have
taken into account the sizable boost in social security taxes associated
with "reform" legislation passed at the end of the Congressional session.
Monetary policy, however, is still assumed to produce growth in the
monetary aggregates at rates consistent with 6 per cent expansion in M1
during 1973.
The quarterly pattern of GNP growth in 1973, as shown in the
table, continues to be for gradual moderation in real terms, with the
rate of price inflation accelerating appreciably less rapidly than in
our preceding projection over the course of the year.

The quarterly projection for 1973 will, as usual, be presented
in detail at next week's Chart Show. We note here in summary that most
demand sectors--residential construction being the only exception--are
expansive in the first half of 1973. Consumer spending is especially
strong, in part because of the large tax refunds in prospect. Business
spending on fixed capital maintains a fairly rapid advance, as suggested
by recent surveys. And inventory investment is expected to rise
further in line with final sales of goods.
In the second half of the year, demand forces are likely to
be losing some of their upward momentum. The bulk of the tax refunds
will have been completed, inventory investment is expected to show
little further increase from the pace reached by mid-year, and residen-
tial construction is projected to be declining. The unemployment rate
is expected to decline to just under 5.0 per cent in the fourth quarter,
about the same rate as projected earlier.

Industrial production. Industrial production increased 0.9
per cent in October and at 116.7 per cent (1967=100) was 9.3 per cent
above a year earlier. The gains in output in October were widespread
among consumer goods, equipment, and materials. The September and August
indexes each have been revised upwards by 0.5 points, to 115.7 and
115.0, respectively. Growth in output has been unusually rapid since
July, at an annual rate of 10 per cent.
Auto assemblies rose 7 per cent in October, to an annual
rate of 9.1 million units. Production schedules for November and December
indicate a further increase of about 6 per cent. If these schedules are
realized, auto output in 1972 would total 8.8 million units compared
with 8.5 million units in 1971. Output of furniture and nondurable
consumer goods rose again in October, but production of appliances changed
little.
Output of business equipment continued to rise strongly and
was 8 per cent above a year ago; it was 12 per cent above the 1971 low
but still 4 per cent below its 1969 peak. Production of defense
equipment changed little in October, and,although up 8 per cent from the
January 1972 low,was still one-fourth below its 1969 peak. Output of
construction products and steel, textiles, and chemicals advanced further.

Retail sales. Sales in October rose by an unusually large
amount, 2.8 per cent, according to the advance report. Advances were
widespread by store type. Further, more complete sample counts raised
earlier estimates of retail sales in August and September, and the third
quarter increase is now reported to be 2.5 per cent--a very large
increment on top of the substantial 3.3 per cent gain in the second
quarter. These changes suggest the likelihood of an upward revision
in third quarter personal consumption expenditures in the GNP accounts.

I-9
In October, all major types of outlets showed moderate to
strong increases. Durable goods sales increased 3.9 per cent from
September, with the automotive group reporting a 5 per cent gain. Non-
durable goods sales were 2.3 per cent higher, with food sales up 2.2
per cent and general merchandise sales up 3.1 per cent.

Unit sales of consumer durables. October sales of new
domestic-type autos were at a 9.8 million unit rate, slightly below
September but the same as a year earlier. Sales have been especially
strong in the past four months, averaging a 9.9 million unit rate. In
the first 10 days of November, sales were at a 9.6 million rate. Dealer
inventories amounted to only a 45-day supply at the end of October, 9
per cent above the reduced September levels,but 13 per cent below the
low level a year earlier.
Sales of imported cars in October were at a 1.5 million unit
rate, down slightly from a month earlier, but up a sixth from October
last year, when dock strikes and Phase I measures sharply curtailed
import sales. The October import share, on a seasonally adjusted
basis, was 13.4 per cent, approximately the same as in September, but
well below the share prior to the adjustment in exchange rates last
year.
Truck sales in October are estimated at a 2.4 million unit
annual rate, up 7 per cent from both a month and a year earlier.
Data for most of October indicate that retailers' unit purchases
of major home appliances were below the levels of both a month and a
year earlier. All appliances in the index, with the exception of
freezers, either remained at or declined from September levels.

Consumer credit. In September, total consumer credit outstanding
expanded at a reduced seasonally adjusted annual rate of $15.9 billion,
The sharp drop from the August high of $22.2 billion was widespread by
both type of credit and lender, and partly reflected the early date of
Labor Day and a decline in the proportion of retail purchases financed
with credit. Scattered trade reports indicate that net credit extensions
rebounded substantially in October.
During the third quarter, the net increase in total consumer
credit edged up to a new high of $18.7 billion. The rise in instalment
credit accelerated further but the advance in the noninstalment sector
was smaller than in the preceding quarter.

Growth in auto credit has accounted for an increasing pro-
portion of the quarterly net gains in instalment credit outstanding
this year. In the first quarter, auto credit rose at a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of $3.9 billion and accounted for 29 per cent of
the total growth in instalment debt; the second and third quarters
showed increases of $5.0 billion (33 per cent) and $5.9 billion (37 per
cent), respectively. Since the end of last year the average instalment
contract has risen about $65 for new cars and nearly $125 for used cars.
In September, finance rates for new cars were one-quarter of a point
below the year earlier level; used car rates have shown an apparent seasonal
rise throughout the model year but were still slightly below the September
1971 level.

I -13
Mobile home credit is becoming an increasingly significant part
of consumer financing activity at commercial banks and finance companies.
At the end of September, mobile home loans outstanding at these insti-
tutions had reached a total of $8.3 billion, up 24 per cent from the
year earlier total of $6.7 billion. Mobile home loans, although still
a relatively small part of total consumer credit outstanding, now con-
stitute 36 per cent of nonautomotive consumer goods credit outstanding at
banks and 46 per cent at finance companies. The $200 million increase
during September in mobile home credit outstanding amounted to one-half
of the total increase in other consumer goods financing.
One reason for the rapid growth in mobile home balances has
been the increase in average price and contract size due to market accep-
tance of "14-wides" and double-wide units. At finance companies, the
average amount financed per contract during September was over $6,500,
up nearly $600 since last spring. Bank contracts have shown an even
larger increase.
Census consumer purchase and income expectations. The
October Census survey indicates an unusually large increase in consumer
optimism--confirming the latest Michigan Survey Research Center report
and the attitudinal questions from the current Conference Board survey.
Buying plans for autos rose sharply, as did purchase plans for homes.
Both intentions to buy major appliances and expected purchases of furn-
iture and carpets were up almost as strongly.

I -14
Actual income changes and expectations of future income
increase were also more favorable. Higher current income was
reported by 40.8 per cent of all households, up sharply from the
34.3 per cent of the July survey. The response is comparable to
the favorable income developments reported during 1968. Income
expectations improved more modestly but households in the July
survey had already indicated a very marked increase in income
expectations.

Anticipated plan and equipment spending. Three recent private
surveys indicate that business now reports plans to increase spending
for new plant and equipment by about 9-11 per cent in 1973. The McGraw-
Hill survey indicates that 1973 spending by manufacturers is programmed
to rise at a more rapid pace (14 per cent) than that of nonmanufacturing
concerns (9 per cent); in contrast, in 1971 and 1972 nonmanufacturing
firms showed much sharper gains. Electric utilities and communication
firms continue to plan further sizable gains in new capital spending.
Historically, the November McGraw-Hill survey taken at this stage
of an economic recovery has tended to understate the actual change by
/about 3 percentage points. Surveys, taken earlier, by Lionel D. Edie
and Rinfret-Boston show generally similar results, although the magnitude
of change is slightly smaller than in the McGraw-Hill survey.

Cyclical indicators. The Census composite index of leading
indicators rose slightly further in September, following a strong
increase in August. Leading series increasing included the workweek,
new orders for durable goods, contracts and orders for plant and
equipment (which exceeded its previous high), housing permits and
industrial materials prices. Series declining were unemployment
initial claims (inverted), common stock prices and the ratio of price
to unit labor cost.

Construction and real estate. Seasonlly adjusted value of
new construction put in place, which was revised downward somewhat for
September, edged off further in October but remained near the August
peak. Within the private sector, a further rise in residential
expenditures was more than offset by a reduction in nonresidential
construction outlays. Outlays for public construction apparently rose
in October, with the rise entirely in Federally owned projects.
The Census Bureau's composite construction cost index in
October remained at the 139 per cent level (1967 equals 100) reached in
September, holding the year-to-year increase to less than 5 per cent

for the fifth consecutive month. This compares with a year-to-year rise
of nearly 7.5 per cent in 1971 as a whole and 7 per cent in 1970.

Seasonally adjusted private housing starts, which had expanded
sharply in August, dipped only 4 per cent in September to an annual rate
of 2.35 million units. As a result, the average for the third quarter
as a whole held above the second quarter pace and, except for this
year's first quarter average, was the highest on record. While housing
starts may move downward during the fourth quarter, the advanced rate
of building-permits and mortgage-commitments in recent month suggests that the
decline will be limited.

Although completions of new housing units have been at a
record rate this year, they have continued appreciably below the
extraordinary level of starts, reflecting, in part, capacity constraints--
particularly for lumber and related materials. Meanwhile, based on sales
data through September, demands for both new and existing dwellingshave
remained very strong. Consequently, rental vacancy rates moved only
moderately higher in the third quarter to an average of 5.8 per cent
of units available for use. This was still below the third quarter rate
in 1968 and well below the record for the series reached in 1965. In
the case of home-owner units, the vacancy rate actually was below the
year-earlier level.

Manufacturers' orders and shipments. New orders for durable
goods rose 3 per cent (p) in September. Most of the increase resulted
from a rebound in the volatile defense orders series, but there was
also a 2.5 per cent increase in orders for nondefense capital goods.
For the third quarter as a whole, new orders were up 2.9 per cent,
which was about half the second quarter rate of increase. Defense
orders were down sharply and nondefense capital goods rose more slowly
than in the second quarter, but orders for motor vehicles and primary
metals accelerated.

above its July 1971 low, somewhat more than the comparable expansion in
1968-69 but only half the 1965-66 increase.

Inventories. Book value of manufacturing and trade inven-
tories rose at a $14.7 billion (p) annual rate in September, not far
below the upward-revised August rate of $18.3 billion. For the quarter
as a whole, the rate was $12.8 billion, well above the second quarter
rate of $8.7 billion and the highest in four years. About $2 billion
of this amount was an unusual increase at wholesale farm and raw
materials dealers; this apparently reflected both higher wheat prices
and movement of grains into warehouses in anticipation of shipment to
Russia.

Labor market. Demand for labor continued strong in October
as both payroll and total employment advanced by over a quarter million.
But the civilian labor force increased sharply as well and the unemploy-
ment rate remained unchanged.
Employment expansion has been brisk in the past three months
following a relatively slack interval during the summer. Much of the
recent strength has been in manufacturing where employment increases
had lagged during the first year of the recovery, spurted in the early
months of 1972, and then remained on a plateau in the late spring and
early summer. Recent gains have been concentrated in durable goods-
primarily metal and metal-using industries. Outside of manufacturing,
employment advances have continued appreciable in trade, services and
finance, and State and local government.

The manufacturing workweek remained at 40.7 hours in October.
The factory workweek has been stable since June, after having risen from a
nine-year low reached in September 1970. Average overtime hours in manu-
facturing also have changed little in recent months, but have been sub-
stantially more than a year ago.
Unemployment and labor force. The unemployment rate remained at
5.5 per cent (seasonally adjusted) in October, about the same as in the
previous four months. Jobless rates for most groups showed little or no
change. Compared with a year ago, when the overall unemployment rate was
5.8 per cent, unemployment was down moderately for adult men, teenagers, and
white workers, while rates remained about the same for household heads,
adult women, and Negro workers. The unemployment situation for Vietnam

I -25
era veterans has improved considerably in recent months, and in October
the rate for veterans 20 to 29 years of age was about the same as the non-
veteran rate.

The civilian labor force increased substantially in October.
Compared to a year earlier, the civilian labor force was up by 2.2
million; about 300,000 of the increase resulted from declines in the
armed forces.
Earnings. Average hourly earnings of production workers on
private nonfarm payrolls (adjusted for overtime in manufacturing and
inter-industry shifts) have been rising at a quickened pace recently;
estimates for September have been revised up, and with substantial increases
also in October the increase in earnings in the last two months has
averaged around 8 per cent (annual rate). Increases have been very rapid

I -26
in several industries--especially services, manufacturing and con-
struction. Since January, nonfarm earnings have increased at a 5.5
per cent rate, but the increase since July has been at nearly a 7 per
cent rate.

Collective bargaining. Wage increases in major nonfarm
collective bargaining settlements averaged 6.6 per cent over-the-life
of the contract in the first nine months of 1972 as compared to the
8 per cent rise in 1971. Settlements in both manufacturing and non-
manufacturing industries were well below wage rate changes negotiated a
year ago, with the construction industry showing a marked slowing.
First year increases have been substantially smaller, indicating a
movement away from the widespread practice of front-end loading of con-
tracts. In addition, contracts this year have a shorter average duration--
about three months on average less than previously--indicating a
tendency toward shorter contracts during the stabilization period,

I -27
especially in the construction industry. Wage and benefit increases
together averaged 7.6 per cent over-the-life of the contract, compared
with 8.8 per cent in 1971.
The new settlements cover nearly 1.5 million workers, pri-
marily in the aerospace, railroad, construction, and maritime industries--
significantly fewer than the 2.8 million covered in the first nine months
of 1971. The Pay Board and the Construction Industry Stabilization
Committee have yet to act on agreements affecting an additional 872,000
workers.

Wholesale prices. Wholesale prices rose between September
and October at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 0.9 per cent, the
smallest monthly increase since last March. Prices of industrial
commodities changed little, and the increase for farm and food prod-
ucts was the smallest in recent months.
Lower seasonally adjusted prices of automobiles and trucks
more than offset substantial increases for lumber and plywood, textile
products and apparel, hides, skins, leather, and iron and steel scrap.
If the transportation equipment group were excluded, industrial
commodities would have shown an annual rate of increase of about 2-1/2
per cent, seasonally adjusted.
On a seasonally unadjusted basis, prices of passenger cars
fell about 2 per cent and trucks more than 1 per cent. In the case
of passenger cars, the BLS allowance for quality improvements in 1973
models was larger than the price rise resulting from the discontinuance
of rebates to dealers and from price increases allowed by the Price
Commission to cover costs of optional equipment made standard on the
new models. After adjustment for seasonal influences the decline in
prices amounted to about 5 per cent for passenger cars and 3 per cent
for trucks.
Although the increase in prices of farm and food products
in October was the smallest in 6 months, consumer finished foods rose
markedly as seasonally adjusted prices of meat, poultry, egg, and
dairy products moved higher.

I -29
During the first 11 months of Phase II, wholesale prices rose
at an annual rate of about 5 per cent, the same rate as in the 8 months
of 1971 preceding the freeze. However, prices of industrial commodities
advanced at a more moderate pace--3.5 per cent--while farm and food
products moved up more rapidly than in the pre-stabilization period.

rate of rise of about 5 per cent for other commodities. The increase in

The sharp rise in food costs in September was largely
attributable to fresh fruit and vegetable prices which dropped much
less than seasonally, as in August, because of short supplies. Beef
prices fell, for the first time since May, but this was more than offset
by advances for pork and poultry.
The increase in apparel prices in September--the first month
in which fall and winter clothing are priced--followed three months of
(seasonally adjusted) declines. Gasoline and motor oil prices rose

I -31
again in September, bringing the 3-month advance since June to the
fastest rate since 1962.
Among durables, prices of 1972-model cars continued to
rise on a seasonally adjusted basis, bringing the increase over the
year to almost 4 per cent. The quality adjustment on 1973-model cars
should affect October retail prices, but by much less than it affected
wholesale prices; the impact will be spread over more than one month
to reflect the proportion of 1973 models in retail auto sales, and the
weight of new cars in the CPI is considerably less than in the WPI.
Agricultural developments. Prices received by farmers
increased 1 per cent in the month ending October 15, led by cattle,
milk, wheat, oranges, and cotton. Lower prices for hogs, eggs, lettuce,
and potatoes were partly offsetting. October red meat and poultry
production was unchanged from the previous month and both the beef
and pork components were unchanged. In recent weeks, increases in
cattle marketings have reduced liveweight prices about 5 per cent since
mid-October, while hog prices have remained at about the October 15
level.
Wet weather in late October and early November has delayed
harvests and increased prices of corn, soybeans, and cotton. Corn is
deteriorating in some areas and cotton quality has been hurt. Corn and
soybean prices are already above last year because of increased
exports, but cotton prices are running 10 per cent lower because of an
expected 30 per cent increase in production.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL SITUATION
The more favorable climate emerging in securities markets at
the time of the last Committee meeting has continued, contributing to
general--although relatively modest--interest rate declines. Recently,
market rates generally have been 10-35 basis points below the 1972
highs reached, in most cases, during September and October. Much of
the recent improvement in market atmosphere has, of course, reflected
expectational factors--stemming from negotiations on Vietnam, the
apparent resolve of the Administration to hold the line on spending
(despite the failure of Congress to adopt a fixed expenditure ceiling),
and evidence of slower growth in the monetary aggregates.
In short-term markets, increased demands for funds have,
nevertheless, tended to blunt much of the downward pressure on rates
resulting from the better market sentiment--although pressures from
Federal borrowing have been less severe than anticipated. Several types
of private borrowing--including business loans at banks, consumer credit,
and commercial paper issued by non-financial corporations--showed sizable
increases in October, and in the case of business loans increased further
in early November. The decision to defer retroactive revenue-sharing
payments until early December reduced the size of the November Treasury
refinancing, and the announcement of Treasury plans to meet its large
December-January cash requirements through a combination of relatively
routine bill and note financings also helped to calm market expectations.
In bond markets, demands for funds have continued to moderate,
and rate declines generally have been more pronounced than in short-term

II -2
markets. Improved tax receipts and the prospect of added near-term
flows from revenue-sharing payments account for the more moderate
State and local government borrowing demands, while expanding flows
of internal funds and greater reliance on alternative forms of external
financing explain the continued moderation of business demands.
Mortgage markets also appear to have been under less pressure
recently, as inflows of funds to thrift institutions have remained
large. In addition, with other institutional lenders seeking outlets
for long-term funds--at a time when yields on bonds have been easing
off and mortgage demands have been slackening seasonally--some specu-
lative warehousing of mortgages has reportedly reappeared among mort-
gage bankers.
Outlook. During the remainder of 1972 the weight of borrowing
in short-term markets seems likely to lead to some updrift in short-term
rates. Business loan demands at banks and possibly also in the commer-
cial paper market should remain strong, as the recent acceleration of
inventory accumulation continues. Most forecasters see consumer loan
growth continuing large. And Federal net cash borrowing from mid-
November through the end of January is expected to total about $7-1/2
billion. However, a partial offset to short-term market demand pressures
will be provided by State and local government investment of some of
the proceeds of $5 billion in revenue sharing funds paid out in early
December and early January.
In accommodating these sizable credit demands, banks will
likely continue to be aggressive issuers of large negotiable CD's and
can be expected to hold back on acquisitions of securities. Inflows

II -3
of other time and savings deposits may continue moderately favorable,
but tax and loan accounts are likely to decline substantially by early
winter as the Treasury seeks to squeeze through its period of peak
deficit. Some of the drop in tax and loan balances, of course, might
be offset by a more rapid expansion of private demand deposits.
So long as short-term rates experience no more than a modest
rise into early 1973, prospective supply-demand relationships in long-
term markets suggest that continued stability and possibly further
declines of long-term rates can be expected. However, any marked
rise in short-term rates that seemed likely to be sustained would soon
be reflected in long rates as well.
Only in the State and local government sector of bond markets
have rates recently tended to rise, and these adjustments followed a
period of several weeks of decline. Sizable additions to the December
bond calendar, at a time when market professionals held large secondary
inventories of other issues, explain the recent market weakening. But
the longer-run outlook is for moderate offerings of new State and local
government issues, partly because the $5 billion of revenue sharing
payments will cover some portion of future State and local government
outlays. In the corporate bond market, there is little reason to
expect much change in the factors accounting for the recent moderation
of new issue volume, although some borrowers have reportedly begun to
add to the calendar for January when institutional investment flows
typically show a seasonal expansion.
Rates in the primary mortgage market, where demands for funds
continue large, seem unlikely to move up in the financial environment

II -4
contemplated. Indeed, there could be some further decline in secondary
market rates, especially if corporate bond prices experience a turn of
the year rally as they often do.
Monetary aggregates. Data now available from the demand
deposit ownership survey 1/ for the third quarter of 1972 suggest that
a significant proportion of the growth of M1 in that period was ac-
counted for by increased holdings of demand balances by nonfinancial
businesses. As can be seen in the table, gross demand deposits of
these businesses are estimated to have increased considerably more in
the third quarter of 1972 than in comparable periods of the previous two
years. An increased demand for transaction balances by such firms is
to be expected during a period of rapid economic expansion and there also
have been reports that banks--in line with the expanding utilization
of credit lines--have been pressing corporate borrowers for higher
compensating balances.
Consumers also increased their holdings of demand balances
over the third quarter more than in the third quarters of 1970 and 1971--
with most of the strength at smaller banks. However, holdings of finan-
cial businesses and foreign depositors showed little change.
1/ The demand deposit ownership survey collects sample data for gross
demand deposits (i.e., before deductions for cash items in the process
of collection) only for individuals, partnerships and corporations.
Insufficient data have been collected to seasonally adjust the
ownership series. The lack of seasonal adjustment, the collection
of data only for deposits owned directly by individuals, partnerships,
and corporations (IPC), and the collection of data on a gross basis
make it impossible to compare the survey results directly with the
seasonally adjusted money supply, but the DDOS is helpful in giving
insight concerning changes in M1.

In October, M1 is estimated to have expanded at a 4.5 per
cent seasonally adjusted annual rate. This increase was close to the
5.5 per cent pace registered in August and September, but sharply below
that in July. Although October growth in M1 was slightly slower than
in September, M2 grew at about the same rate, as time deposits other
than large certificates of deposit continued to expand relatively
rapidly. The incraase in consumer-type time and savings deposits ap-
peared strong at both country and reserve city banks.
The increase in outstanding negotiable CD's (seasonally
adjusted) was the smallest since March. In large part because of the
substantial increase in Treasury deposits, banks did not need to rely
as heavily on CD sales for funds. In general, offering rates on CD's
edged downward during the month in unison with rates on competing
financial assets in comparable maturity ranges.

The slower growth in demand and total time deposits in October
was offset in part by a rise in the level of U.S. government deposits.
Consequently, growth in the adjusted bank credit proxy was only marginally
below that of September and the third quarter.
Bank credit. Total bank credit (seasonally adjusted, last
Wednesday of the month series) expanded at a moderately higher rate
in October than in September.1/ Following a slow-down in September,
total loans increased rapidly, while bank holdings of securities declined.
Almost all loan categories showed strength during the month, with business
loans and loans to nonbank financial institutions experiencing the
largest increases; real estate and consumer loans continued to rise at
close to the relatively high third quarter rates.
It should be noted that over the last five months, there have
been large monthly fluctuations in the growth rate of business loans,
suggesting that seasonal adjustment or other technical problems may be
affecting the month-to-month changes. Hence, the underlying trend in
business loans is probably better measured by the relatively strong
12 to 14 per cent average growth rate of recent months, than by the
increase for any one month. This substantial growth in business loans
in recent months is consistent with the increasing working capital needs
of firms in an expanding economy. Indeed, in October the rise in busi-
ness loans was accompanied by a sharp increase in dealer placed com-
mercial paper, an increase only slightly less than the surge in June.

In recent weeks, the increased business loan demand at banks
appears to be broadly based geographically and across industry groups.
However, at large banks in October, borrowing by public utilities and
trade concerns seemed especially strong, after allowance for the usual
seasonal factors.
Borrowings by finance companies and other nonbank financial
institutions also were strong during the month. The increase in bank
borrowing by nonbank financial institutions was associated in part with
a large September sale of mortgages by GNMA to mortgage companies for
delivery in October. In addition, it is reported that mortgage companies
were increasing their inventory positions in speculation on future price
rises.
Total holdings of securities declined in October, largely
reflecting a sizable drop in holdings of Government securities. The
decline in Governments was concentrated exclusively at large banks, while
small banks increased their holdings. Smaller than usual net cash
borrowing by the Treasury, together with the increasing loan demand, con-
tributed to the net decline in acquisitions of Treasury securities at
large banks. Bank holdings of other securities showed no net increase
for the first time since June; an increase at large banks offset a
decline at smaller banks--where bank loans and holdings of Treasury
issues rose sharply.
Over-all liquidity positions of larger commercial banks still
remained high. New York City weekly reporting banks maintained liquid-
ity ratios near this year's peak levels, while the liquidity positions
of other weekly reporting banks have been essentially unchanged since
early in the year.

Short-term interest rates. A generally calm atmosphere has
prevailed in short-term security markets since the October 17 FOMC meet-
ing, and interest rates have edged slightly lower. In the market for
U.S. Treasury bills, rates declined on balance from about 6 basis points
in the 3-month maturity area to 22 basis points in the one-year area.
Market professionals, observing the recent shift toward moderation in
money supply growth, have apparently concluded that the Federal Reserve
may not be under pressure to tighten for awhile. Announcement of the
Treasury's decision to auction $2 billion of April tax bills November 17
for payment November 24, and $2.5 billion of June tax bills November 29
for payment on December 5, both with full tax and loan account credit,
had been generally anticipated and exerted only a slight impact on bill
rates.
Rates on private short-term securities also edged lower since
the last Committee meeting. Commercial paper and commercial bank CD's
in the 90 to 119 day maturity areas, for example, dropped about 1/8 of a
percentage point, offsetting rate increases recorded during early October.
With the drop in open market rates, two banks that follow a floating prime
rate policy lowered their rates by 1.8 of a percentage point to 5-3/4 per
cent, bringing them into line with rates charged by other major banks.
The generally improved outlook in securities markets ensured a
highly successful mid-November Treasury refinancing. In this operation
a single 6-1/4 per cent 4-year note was auctioned to redeem $1.3

billion of maturing issues and raise $1.7 billion of new money.
Subscriptions to the offering exceeded $7 billion and the average
rate was set at 6.20 per cent. Since then, the yield on the issue
declined to 6.11 per cent in when-issued trading.

Nonbank financial institutions. According to sample data,
the estimated annual rate of deposit growth at thrift institutions
slowed during October to 12-1/2 per cent from the 15-1/2 per cent
rate recorded in September and the third quarter as a whole. But net
inflows to S&L's continued relatively strong by historical standards
with high-yielding certificate accounts attracting the major portion of
new funds. At the end of September, certificate accounts constituted
nearly half of total savings capital, up from 44 per cent a year ago.

Mortgage market. Net mortgage debt expanded at an estimated
record seasonally adjusted annual rate of $66 billion in the third
quarter, with savings and loan associations particularly large lenders.
Residential mortgage debt formation rose to another record high, while
formation of nonresidential mortgage debt showed little change. In
addition to the larger number of dwelling units financed, a higher rate
of loan refinancing as well as an increase in average loan amount have
contributed to the rise in residential mortgage debt during recent
quarters. According to FHLBB data, the average size of conventional
home loans closed in the third quarter of 1972 was 5 per cent higher
for new and 9 per cent higher for existing-home loans, as compared to
the third quarter of last year.
Outstanding mortgage commitments on all types of properties,
which normally indicate future trends in mortgage debt formation,
rose further at savings and loan associations and at New York State
mutual savings banks in September, reaching a record seasonally adjusted
total of over $23 billion--7 per cent above the level at the end of
the second quarter and 42 per cent above a year earlier. In addition
to larger loan amounts, the rise in outstanding commitments at S&L's
appears to reflect, in part, a further rise in their share of total
mortgage lending.
Rates on home mortgages were virtually unchanged in October,
according to HUD (FHA). In the primary market, the average rate on

II -15
conventional first mortgages remained at 7.70 per cent for new-home
loans, and 7.75 per cent for existing-home loans. In the secondary
market for Government-underwritten new-home loans, the average yield
edged up 1 basis point further to 7.57 per cent.

NOTE: FHA series: interest rates on conventional first mortgages
(excluding additional initial fees and charges) are rounded by
FHA to the nearest 5 basis points. On FHA loans carrying the 7
per cent ceiling rate in effect since mid-February 1971, a
change of 1.0 points in discount is associated with a change
of 12 to 14 basis points in yield. Gross yield spread is
average mortgage return, before deducting servicing costs, minus
average yield on new Aaa utility bonds.

In the latest FNMA auction held on November 13, the average
yield on the forward purchase commitments for FHA and VA underwritten
home loans edged down 1 basis point to 7.71 per cent, the first

II -16
decline since mid-August. In addition, bids received by FNMA dropped
sharply further to the lowest amount in 5 months, reflecting a recent
change in the outlook of mortgage companies from an expectation that
mortgage prices would continue to decline to an anticipation of a rise
in prices by year end.
Long-term security markets. Yields on long-term securities
have declined from 6 to 20 basis points since the October Committee
meeting, as apparent agreement on a Vietnam peace settlement sparked a
rally. At the same time, favorable expectations on the future course
of interest rates were being generated by relatively light forward
calendars, the slowed growth of M1, and an edging down of most short-
term interest rates. Moderation of fears about rising interest rates
stimulated acquisition of bonds by long-term investors and enabled
corporate dealers, particularly, to lighten inventory positions that
became heavy in late October. The improved market atmosphere also
contributed to the relative ease with which the Treasury has been
able to initiate borrowing to meet its fourth-quarter cash requirements.

From mid-October to mid-November there was a decline of
about 20 basis points in yields on high-grade utility bonds, while
yields on long-term U. S. Government securities fell 15 to 20 basis
points. Yields on municipal bonds declined only about 6 basis points,

II -18
on balance, over the period as some back-up in tax-exempt yields
occurred in response to the announcement on November 9 of a $1 billion
increase in the 30-day visible supply. Current levels of yields on
private long-term bonds are only about 20 basis points higher than
their 1972 lows. However, yields on Treasury bonds are 40 basis points
above their yearly low, reflecting the impact of significant debt
lengthening accomplished by the Treasury since mid-year.
The stock market began to rally in mid-October, apparently
on the basis of the Vietnam peace reports. During the first two
weeks of November, the rise in equity prices on the major exchanges
continued, with the Dow-Jones Industrial Index showing a particularly
strong gain. Most major indices are now at or near all-time highs.
Volume on the major exchanges has surged recently, with the NYSE
averaging over 21 million shares for the first 9 business days of
November.

The forward calendar for new corporate securities continues
to indicate a greater-than-seasonal decline in public bond offerings
in the fourth quarter. October volume, which was swelled by several
large finance company issues, was about $1.7 billion. With the
continued lack of filings by industrial corporations and the
relatively small volume of utility debt offerings, the staff estimates
that November volume will be about $850 million and the December total,
$1 billion. Takedowns of private placements are projected at a monthly
average of over $700 million. Insurance companies and other institu-
tional investors are reported to be still actively seeking private
placements. New equity issues, while expected to decline somewhat,
especially around the year-end holiday season, will probably remain
close to the $1 billion monthly average.

Although market participants were surprised by the sudden
increase in schedulings of tax-exempt securities for late November
and December, the staff estimates that total offerings of long-term
debt by State and local governments, including these recent additions,
will decline in the fourth quarter. Thus, monthly average volume may
be significantly below the $2 billion level which has prevailed for
almost 2 years. Commercial banks appear to have slackened the pace of
their acquisitions recently, especially in the maturity range beyond
7 years. However, casualty companies continue to be a major purchaser
in the long-term tax-exempt market, having experienced an unusually
favorable cash flow this year.

II -21
Federal finance. In light of the Administration's recent
statements that it intends to hold down fiscal year 1973 spending, the
staff has revised downward its projection of outlays to $253.0 billion.
This, combined with an upward revision of receipts to $226.5 billion,
results in a revised deficit of $26.5 billion, a figure $4.0 billion
below that shown in the October Greenbook.
Since the last Greenbook, a number of bills were enacted that
increased estimated outlays. Among these are water pollution control
($700 million), and social security liberalization and medicare, HR-1
($900 million). New legislation and developments in "uncontrollable"
outlays would have raised estimated outlays to $258 billion, as shown
in the table on the next page. However, we assume $4 billion of savings
attributable to the Administration's efforts at controlling spending,
and approximately $1 billion more as the result of the expected settle-
ment of the Vietnam War.
Our estimate of receipts has been increased by about $2.0
billion since the October Greenbook largely as the result of the
increase in social insurance tax rates incorporated in HR-1. On a
calendar year basis, this tax rate increase amounts to $3.5 billion
and, together with previously legislated increases effective
January 1973, it will raise social insurance receipts by $10 billion
(annual rate).
The staff is holding to its earlier projection of $6.5
billion in extra withholding for calendar year 1972, which together
with the correction for previous underwithholding, results in an $C
billion year-to-year increase in refunds payable in the first two

II -22
quarters of calendar 1973. However, since monthly withholding receipts
for September and October have been lower than projected, there is the
possibility of a moderate downward revision in these figures.
These changes in estimated receipts and expenditures resulted
in rather substantial reductions in our projections of the high employ-
ment deficit--$4.3 billion for fiscal 1973 and $6.8 billion for calendar
1973. We are currently projecting-a high employment deficit of $12.0
billion for fiscal 1973 and one of $8.3 billion for calendar 1973. For
calendar year 1972 our estimate shows a deficit of $2.0 billion. A
sharp move toward fiscal restraint is foreseen for the last two quarters
of calendar 1973 with the budget going from a deficit of $16.1 billion
(annual rate) in 1973 II to a surplus of $2.2 billion (annual rate) in
1973 IV. The following table indicates the major factors accounting
for these shifts.

tax anticipation bills, as mentioned previously. In addition, a $2
billion two-year note issue is expected to be auctioned in late
December, and additions to the weekly bill auctions are projected to
be continued. Borrowing in the first quarter of calendar 1973 is still
expected to be large for that period of the year. Our current first
quarter estimate is $9.0 billion.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
Summary and outlook. The U.S. balance of payments was in
deficit on official settlements by about $3/4 billion in the five weeks
ended November 8. U.S. reserve liabilities to Japan have risen by much more
than this amount, while reserve liabilities to other countries have
declined on balance.
The outlook for the U.S. balance of payments in the remainder
of 1972 is dependent on short-term flows associated with developements
in exchange markets -and in particular in the market for the yen. In
the absence of such flows, the customary seasonal reflows could be ex-
pected to hold down the deficit on official settlements.
The third quarter deficit on official settlements of $4.7
billion (seasonally adjusted) reflected outflows in July following the
floating of the pound, but, for the 3 months August-October, it appears
that the official settlements deficit was on the order of $1 billion
(not seasonally adjusted). As in the spring, this result reflected a
large underlying deficit, offset to a considerable extent by private
capital flows, including further short-term inflows through banking
channels and foreign purchases of U.S. stocks.
The trade deficit continued large through September. Imports
of industrial materials were strong in the third quarter, reflecting
accelerated domestic activity; however, lack of growth in most groups
of finished goods imports may indicate some impact of last year's re-
alignment of exchange rates. Export expansion in the third quarter was
very strong and included growth in most major commodity categories.

III -2
Increased exports to Western Europe and Canada accounted for most of
the expansion.
Revised projections of an inter-agency committee point to
a reduction in the deficit on goods and services from about $4-3/4
billion this year to about half that amount next year. Essentially
all of this improvement is expected on merchandise trade -- reflecting
the effects of exchange rate realignment, as well as larger exports of
argricultural commodities and aircraft (both of which will involve
larger outflows of Government-related capital). Little improvement is
expected in the service balance, since interest payments on a larger
stock of foreign liquid dollar assets are likely to increase. Moreover,
projected increased outflows of U.S. Government grants and credits and
of private long-term capital (as direct investment increases from depressed
levels) suggest that the basic balance -- current account plus govern-
ment and private long-term capital -- will be little changed in 1973
from the $11-12 billion range expected this year.
This projection is based on the assumption of further recovery
and expansion abroad. The OECD Secretariat projects strong growth in
the major European industrial countries and in Japan through the end
of next year, with some narrowing of margins of excess capacity.
Foreign exchange and Euro-dollar markets. During the past
five weeks sterling and the Japanese yen have been the foci of attention
in the exchange markets. Sterling declined by about 3 percent between
October 11 and November 14, while the yen required massive intervention
by the Bank of Japan to keep it from soaring above its ceiling rate.

III -3
Rates for continental European currencies declined slightly, on balance,
and the Canadian dollar weakened in the first few days following the
inconclusive Canadian Parliamentary elections on October 30.
Sterling began the period at around $2.42, eased moderately
over the next week, then plunged precipitously from October 19 to
October 27, reaching a low of $2.32 on the latter date. The stimulus
for the selling of sterling appeared to be the threat of a power
workers' strike and subsequent market rumors and press speculation
that sterling would be re-pegged as low as $2.25, this against the back-
ground of an acceleration of Britain's wage-price inflation. The Bank
of England did little to cushion the drop in the rate, selling only
about $134 million in market intervention. In the last two days of
October and in early November sterling staged a modest recovery, with
the rate rising more than one full cent on November 6 when Prime Minister
Heath proposed a stationary wage-price freeze to Parliament. The Bank
of England purchased about $50 million as sterling rallied. In recent
days the pound has fluctuated fairly narrowly around the $2.35 level.
The Bank of Japan purchased $18 billion in the five weeks
ended November 14, bringing its total intervention purchases since
sterling was floated to $4.8 billion. On October 20 Japan announced
a five-point program to reduce its swollen trade surplus which in-
cluded, inter alia, tariff cuts, import quota increases and proposed
quantitative limits on exports by commodity by country. The announce-
ment of these proposals had little effect on market expectations of an

III -4
early yen appreciation, however, and Bank of Japan intervention con-
tinued in sizeable amounts. Forward yen quotes are currently at
substantial premiums, with yen for delivery in April currently
quoted at nearly 10 per cent above par.
Continental European currencies as a group have eased
modestly over the period. The effects of higher interest rates in
Europe have apparently been overshadowed by a general bullishness towards
the dollar as a result of the movement towards a Vietnam settlement and
the re-election of the President. The German Federal Bank sold $244
million between October 12 and November 8. Other continental central
banks (probably excepting Italy) did not intervene in recent weeks,
though the System continued its small daily purchases of Swiss and
Belgian francs in order to effect swap repayments.
The Canadian dollar, which had been holding steady at around
$1.0180, dropped by about 2/5 of one cent in the first few days after
the Canadian elections with the Bank of Canada providing some $80
million in market support. In recent days the rate has stabilized
around $1.0140 and the Bank of Canads has not done much in the market.
In the Euro-dollar market, the overnight rate has declined
slightly over the past month. A rise in the Federal funds rate during
this period has raised the differential favoring U.S. bank's borrowing
of reserve-free overnight Euro-dollars to a current level of 1/2 per
cent. However, overnight Euro-dollar borrowings subject to the 20 per
cent reserve requirement are still about 60-70 basis points more costly

than Federal funds borrowings. The rates on Euro-dollar deposits of
one-and three-month maturity have also softened slightly since mid-
October, but approximately equal declines in CD rates of comparable
maturity have kept the relative cost to U.S. banks of these potential
sources of funds unchanged, with the reserve-free cost of one-month
Euro-dollars equal to that for one-month CD's and the three-month Euro-
dollar rate exceeding the three-month CD rate by about 2/3 per cent.
The daily average of U.S. banks' liabilities to their foreign
branches has continued stable during the past month at a level slightly
above the Regulation M reserve free base. Continuing the pattern of
the previous month, liabilities of U.S. agencies and branches of foreign
banks to foreign commercial banks have risen further since mid-October,
increasing by about $800 million in the four week period ended November 8.
Balance of payments. The U.S. payments deficit on official
settlements showed a deficit in October and early November of about
$3/4 billion -- roughly the size of the September surplus. For the
three months August-October the deficit has been on the order of $1
billion (not seasonally adjusted) -- little changed from the rate of
deficit that has obtained since early spring, apart from the extra-
ordinary outflow in July following the decision of the United Kingdom
to float the pound.
These relatively low rates of official settlements deficit
in the face of a persisting large current account deficit reflect
continued private capital inflows. Agencies and branches of foreign
banks were increasing their outstanding foreign borrowings through early
November. Foreign purchases of U.S. stocks amounted to $170 million

II -7
in September and according to preliminary indicators continued large
in October. An additional inflow in September was a reduction of
$400 million in bank-reported claims on Canada -- probably in good
part customers' claims.
U.S. foreign trade. In September the trade deficit was
slightly larger than in August as exports slipped while imports were
unchanged. For the third quarter the deficit was at an annual rate
of $6-3/4 billion (balance of apyments basis), down from $7-3/4 billion
in the second quarter but about the same level as in the first quarter
Exports in the third quarter were about 7 percent higher than in the
second quarter, all in volume as prices (unit-values) rose only
marginally. Imports in the third quarter also increased but more
moderately -- 4 percent -- with about a third of the increase accounted
for by higher prices, principally in foods.
The trade deficit in the third quarter was still very high,
with shifts in the commodity composition of trade indicating that
an increasingly important element is the strong growth in domestic
business activity. The bulk of the increase in imports from the second
to the third quarter was in industrial materials -- particularly
petroleum, but also in paper, steel and other metals and textiles.
Almost all of the increase in imports of industrial materials represented
higher volumes. The value of imports of foodstuffs also increased in
the third quarter but this was largely because of higher prices for
coffee, meat and fish.

III -8
In contrast to the upturn in these classes of imports, imports
of finished goods -- capital equipment, automobiles and other durable
consumer goods -- all fell or showed little change from the second to
the third quarter, both in value and in real terms. Only in the non-
durable consumer goods sector were imports higher. Of even greater
significance is that in the third quarter imports of each of these classes
of finished goods, again with the exception of nondurable consumer
goods, was a decreasing portion of total domestic expenditure on thes
types of goods. The absolute levels of imports of finished products are
still very high by any past standard, perhaps in part because movements of
these goods may still be affected to some degree by the disrupting
effects of domestic strikes that occurred last year. The third quarter
data, however, suggest that the exchange-rate changes of the Smithsonian
Agreement may be beginning to slow the long-term rise in the ratio of
imports to total domestic expenditures for such goods.
The steep rise in exports in the third quarter was broadly
based across commodity categories and included increases in agricultural
products, industrial materials, machinery, consumer goods, and automobile
parts to Canada. Shipments of agricultural commodities accounted for
about one-fourth of the total rise, reflecting not only heavier grain
shipments to the Soviet Union but also larger exports of rice,
hides and skins, and tobacco to other countries. Grain movements to
Russia, however, have proceeded rather slowly because of transportation
problems and movement of the $1-1/4 billion of grain and soybeans sold
to that country is certain to accelerate in the coming months.
Particularly encouraging in the pattern of exports in the third quarter

III -9
was the steep rise in deliveries of machinery and a wide variety of
nonagricultural industrial materials -- chemicals, steel, metals.
Foreign orders for U.S. machinery are holding up well and the expecta-
tions of stronger economic activity abroad, particularly in Japan,
should stimulate further advances in exports of these commodities.
Exports of commercial aircraft slumped in the third quarter but a sharp
pickup is expected in the current quarter as deliveries of the new
DC-10's to foreign airlines begin and an increased number of jumbo jets
are exported.
Exports to all major areas increased from the second to the
third quarters with shipments to the Western European countries particularly
strong. The rise in exports to Canada was virtually all in automotive
equipment while the near doubling of exports to the Soviet Union resulted
from the heavy movement of grains.

III -10
The short-term outlook for economic activity in the major
industrial countries. Economic activity in all the major industrial
countries has recovered this year from the generally slow pace in
1971. The growth of output is generally expected to continue next
year -- in most cases at an accelerated rate. This past year private
consumption expenditures, and, to a lesser extent, government
expenditures, have been the main factors contributing to growth,
but in 1973 private investment expenditures in most countries
are expected to expand more rapidly and to become relatively more
important.
This is the view expressed by the OECD Secretariat in a
set of forecasts prepared in October for the recent Short-Term
Forecasters' and Economic Policy Committee meetings. The Secretariat
expects a rate of growth of real GNP for the seven major OECD
1/countries- of around 6-1/2 per cent through the end of 1973 --
compared to the long-run average rate of growth of about 5-1/2 per
cent. It also expects that existing margins of excess capacity will
be reduced, in some countries to the point where aggregate demand
pressures may become a matter of policy concern before the end
of next year.
Our own assessment of the outlook for economic activity
in the major countries is in substantial agreement with that of
1/ Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and
the United States.

III -11
the Secretariat on two points: (1) the cyclical upswing is
generally expected to continue at least through next year, and
(2) current rates of price increase are clearly too high in many
countries and inflation may even become more of a problem next
year. However, large margins of unemployed resources do exist in
most countries. With the impact of fiscal policies expected to be
somewhat less expansionary next year in any case, and with the
Common Market countries (including the United Kingdom) presumably
committed to slowing down rates of growth of monetary aggregates
in those countries, it seems premature to suggest that further
actions to restrict the growth of demand will soon be desirable.
For the major industrial countries other than Canada
and the United States, the rate of growth of GNP forecast for 1973
is not significantly different from the average rate observed from
1958-59 to 1969-70. Moreover, because the current expansion
follows an extended period of slow growth or recession, it is
accompanied by historically high rates of productivity increase.
Consequently, increases in unit labor costs are moderating in many
countries, despite continued relatively high wage settlements in some
cases. In Germany and the Netherlands, for example, unit labor
costs have flattened out completely and are beginning to decline.
In short, output expansion at this stage of the cycle tends to re-
duce costs rather than to increase them, at least in the short run.

III -12
Economic activity in Germany surged strongly in the first
quarter of this year, reflecting partly exceptionally strong
construction activity due to the mild weather, and partly a re-
covery from output levels which were depressed in late-1971
by international uncertainties and strikes. In the second quarter
growth of output fell back, so that real GNP in the first half of
1972 as a whole increased at an annual rate of 5.7 per cent.
Real GNP is expected to grow more slowly in the second
half of this year, and then to pick up somewhat in 1973 to a rate
of a little more than 5 per cent. The pick-up next year is based
on an assumption that business fixed investment will be stronger.
Favorable export prospects, an improvement in company profits,
and relatively high rates of capacity utilization for this stage
of the cycle -- as well as recent business surveys -- suggest that
the business climate is favorable. Inventories, which have been
falling the last two years, are also expected to be built up to
more normal levels as growth continues. Residential construction
should remain buoyant, but will show slowing rates of growth due
to the exceptionally large output in the first half of this year.
Both private consumption expenditures and net exports
are expected to contribute about the same amount to real growth
in 1973 as in 1972. Consumption should remain fairly strong,
bolstered by an accelerated growth in earnings and transfers
from the public sector; this will be offset only partially by a

III -13
faster rise in prices. German exports may increase rapidly next
year as Germany's export markets expand, but German imports will
accelerate as well as the cycle progresses.
Consumer expenditures in the United Kingdom recovered
strongly in the first half of this year. Fixed investment ex-
penditures also showed some strength, with an upswing in private
residential investment, especially, offsetting continued declines
in investment expenditures by the manufacturing industry. This
increase in demand, however, was reflected in only moderate growth
of output, as inventories were run down significantly.
The outlook for activity in the United Kingdom is clouded
by uncertainties over the effects of the wage/price freeze imposed
by the Heath Government on November 6 (see Appendix A). However,
recent surveys suggest that private investment expenditure by the
manufacturing sector will turn up, despite the continued existence
of considerable excess capacity. In addition, there is likely to
be some rebuilding of inventories, given the historically low
stock/output ratios, although it does seem that there has been a
permanent shakeout of inventories (i.e., desired normal stock/
output ratios may now be permanently lower than was previously the
case).
Two big questions remain as a result of the freeze.
(1) Will fixed investment and stockbuilding be sufficiently strong
to sustain growth at something like the current 5 per cent annual

III -14
rate in the face of somewhat slower growth of government expenditures
and, perhaps, less buoyant consumer demand (as the freeze retards
the growth of real income)? (2) How much, if at all, will the foreign
sector contribute to the growth of aggregate demand next year?
The recovery in Japan which began around the turn of the
year was fueled by a sharp recovery in private consumption and strong
government investment. Both of these factors resulted in large part
from the Supplementary Budget for FY 1971 (ending March 1972), which
provided for a sizable increase in expenditure and a reduction in
taxes. The strength of private consumption, in real terms, also
reflected a slowdown in the rate of increase of prices while wages
and employment rose more rapidly. Private fixed investment expendi-
tures, ith the exception of investment by the manufacturing industry,
has also been strong. But stockbuilding was weak, and the foreign
balance deteriorated significantly (in constant yen prices), so that
the growth of real GNP has been limited in 1972 to about 9 per cent --
or moderately lower than pre-recession levels.
In 1973 real GNP is now expected to increase by about 11
per cent. This forecast has recently been revised upward in light
of a Supplementary Budget for FY 1972 (ending March 1973) that was
approved by the Cabinet on October 20. The strong advance in real
consumption expenditures is not expected to continue, in spite of
rapidly rising nominal disposable income and a possible fall in the
saving ratio, largely because consumer prices may accelerate.
Residential construction is assumed to remain very strong, although

III -15
this assumption may be overly optimistic. Business investment may
recover, but business confidence is depressed by considerable uncer-
tainty concerning the trend of exports and the future course of
public policies (an election is scheduled for December 10, following
the dissolution of the Diet on November 13). Finally, both the
trade and current account surpluses are expected to decline somewhat
from the high 1972 levels, with exports forecast to rise, but with
imports forecast to rise considerably more rapidly. The net contri-
bution of the foreign sector to the growth of total demand will
remain negative in 1973 (i.e., net exports in volume terms will
become smaller) -- in marked contrast to 1971.
In Canada, output growth accelerated sharply in the second
quarter of this year. The growth rate of real GNP has averaged
about 7 per cent (annual rate) in the six quarters ending in mid-
1972. The second-quarter acceleration reflected primarily a 10-1/2
per cent (annual rate) increase in consumer expenditures -- based,
in turn, on a sharp rise in government transfer payments -- and a
strengthening of the external sector.
Growth of real GNP is expected to continue next year at
about the same rate as in 1972 -- a little over 6 per cent --
although forecasts both by the OECD Secretariat and by some Canadian
observers suggest that growth may peak around mid-year. Consumer
expenditures should remain strong, with only a gradual deceleration
from current high rates of growth. Residential construction

III -16
activity may decelerate, but only gradually. Business investment,
particularly in machinery and equipment, should show considerable
strength, and an increase in inventories from very low inventory/
shipment levels is expected. Rising economic activity abroad --
especially in the United States -- should stimulate Canadian exports,
but imports are also likely to grow rapidly. In spite of continued
rapid output growth, unemployment is expected to remain a problem
in 1973; the unemployment rate stood at 6.7 per cent in the third
quarter of this year.

A-1
APPENDIX A: THE WAGE/PRICE FREEZE IN THE UNITED KINGDOM*
On November 6, Prime Minister Heath introduced into Parliament
the Counter-Inflationary (Temporary Provisions) Bill, which provides
that essentially all prices, wages, rents, and dividends are to be
frozen as of November 6. The freeze initially will last 90 days from
the date on which the Bill is passed and receives Royal Assent. Since
passage is expected to take several weeks, at least, the freeze will
last roughly 4 months, and can be extended a further 60 days. That
is, it could last until May of next year.
Some of the details of the "Phase I" freeze, based on a
white paper entitled "A Programme for Controlling Inflation", are as
follows:
A. Prices. The standstill applies to prices and charges
for goods and services supplied to the home market by either the
private or the public sector. Increases announced, but not implemented,
prior to November 6 are not allowed. Enterprises that believe their
costs (either import costs or domestic costs) have risen so much that
they cannot be absorbed may request an exemption; exemption will
ordinarily be granted only in cases where raw materials or raw agri-
cultural produce account for a high proportion of total costs.
Wholesalers and retailers are expected to do everything
possible to avoid any increases in prices; in particular they should
not increase their cash margins during the freeze.
Certain prices -- especially those for fresh food such as
fruit, vegetables, meat and fish and for imported raw materials --
are subject to fluctuations arising from external or seasonal causes.
When such prices rise, enterprises handling these products without
applying any manufacturing process to them may raise their prices by
the same amount. When there are price reductions, enterprises will
be expected to pass them on in full.
B. Employment Incomes. The standstill applies to all
increases in pay and to other improvements in the terms and conditions
of employment (e.g., hours and holidays). The term "pay" covers all
*Prepared by Larry J. Promisel, Economist, World Payments and Economic
Activity Section, Division of International Finance.

A-2
rates of pay, including, in addition to the basic rate, rates of pay
for overtime or weekend work, piece rates, and all allowances normally
considered as pay. The standstill will not apply to increases in
earnings resulting directly from extra effort or output under existing
arrangements (e.g., increases in piece work earnings based on increased
output), nor will it apply to individual pay increases resulting from
genuine oromotions.
In all cases where a settlement was reached before the
freeze, and the operative date of increase was on or before November 6,
the increase can be implemented. Otherwise, the operative date of
such increases must be deferred until the standstill ends. Similarly,
any increase resulting from negotiations or arbitrations which take
place during the standstill must be deferred, and will be subject to
the policy in force after the standstill.
The standstill will also apply to salaries and other forms
of remuneration not determined by collective bargaining, as well as
to charges and fees for services by self-employed persons.
C. Rents. Rents on private accommodations, as well as on
business premises and land, are subject to the standstill provisions.
Increases in rent which are already scheduled must be deferred until
the end of the standstill.
D. Dividends. The standstill will apply to dividends declared
by companies incorporated in the U.K. These companies will not be
allowed to declare dividends in excess of the corresponding amount in
the same calendar period a year ago.
E. Interest rates are not subject to the freeze.
F. Enforcement. The Government is relying on the public to
notify them of violations. Fines will be imposed in cases where an
individual or company fails to comply with a Government order to roll
back prices, incomes, charges, or dividends or withholds information,
and also where anyone acts to force an increase contrary to the pro-
visions of the freeze. Orders can be given prohibiting the raising of
dividends or rents.1/ Fines for breach of any order can be up to £400
on summary convictions, and up to an unspecified amount on conviction
1/ Strictly speaking, one cannot be fined for raising prices or wages,
but rather for refusing to roll them back upon request.

A-3
on indictment. Refusing to supply information, or giving false informa-
tion, will carry a fine up to £100.
If unions strike against an order, they will be liable to
fines as corporations, not as groups of individuals. (This provision
is designed to avoid having to deal with "martyrs" as the Government
did in conjunction with the Industrial Relations Act.) If individual
workers are fined, the fines can be collected by "attachment of earnings"
orders on their employers.
The freeze was imposed after the tripartite talks -- among
the Government, the Confederation of British Industry, and the Trade
Unions Congress -- broke down on November 2.
The tripartite talks, which were sought as a "more sensible
way of settling our differences" in the wake of the miners' strike
in February, began on July 18. On September 26, Prime Minister Heath
put forward a proposal designed to sustain growth of real income, to
improve the relative position of lower paid workers, and to restrain
the rate of inflation. The main points of the proposal included a
commitment to a 5 per cent rate of real growth, a 5 per cent limit
on retail price increases, a £2 per week flat-rate pay increase, and
threshold agreements.
The talks finally broke down at the beginning of November,
partly because the unions were unhappy with a flat-rate increase in
general, and a £2 limit in particular, and also because the unions
were not prepared to adopt a voluntary wage policy unless there were
stronger guarantees -- preferably statutory -- that price rises would
not exceed the limits. The CBI, in turn, was not prepared to accept
a statutory price policy and insisted that price rises -- even at the
retail level -- would be restrained.
With the season of wage settlements approaching, with
sterling floating, and with entry into the Common Market scheduled
for January 1, some action to restrain wage and price inflation
was clearly called for. This freeze, therefore, can properly be
viewed as a means of buying time for a longer-term wage/price policy
to be worked out. The Heath Government is still hopeful that the
tripartite talks will continue -- despite the unions' insistence that
they will not participate -- and that a workable "Phase II" program
can be agreed upon in that forum. Otherwise, a statutory policy will
be forthcoming. In either case, the expectation now is that the
"Phase II" program will resemble the proposals Prime Minister Heath
put forward in September.
