Prefatory Note  
 
 
The attached document represents the most  complete and accurate version available 
based on original copies culled from the f iles of the FOMC Secretariat at the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve Syst em.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization proce ss which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain. 
 Please note that some material may have b een redacted from this document if that 
material was received on a confidential ba sis.  Redacted material is indicated by 
occasional gaps in the text or by gray boxe s around non-text content.  All redacted 
passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable provisions of the Freedom of 
Information Act.           
 
   
 
    
 
                                                            
 
1  In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic 
format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to rem ove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing). 
 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optical character recognition computer program (OCR) 
first created electronic text from the document im age.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, 
staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.  Pl ease note that the numbers and text in charts and 
tables were not reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff.

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Real GNP is now estimated to have risen at an annual rate of
around 8-1/2 per cent in the fourth quarter rather than the 7-1/2
per cent projected four weeks ago. Strength was especially pronounced
in private final purchases, with consumer spending expansive and
business fixed investment and residential construction activity
exceeding earlier expectations. The GNP deflator is estimated to have
increased at an annual rate of 2.3 per cent, below the 2.9 per cent
previously projected. But the private fixed weight index apparently
increased at a 2.7 per cent rate, about as much as had been projected.
Industrial production is estimated to have risen appreciably
further in December, but not as rapidly as in the past several months.
For the quarter as a whole, the increase was at an annual rate of about
11-1/2 per cent. Nonfarm payroll employment rose only a little further
in December from an upward revised November level; for the quarter the
increase was at an annual rate of 3.4 million. The unemployment rate
in December remained at the reduced 5.2 per cent reached in November.
Retail sales increased only a little in December, according
to the advance report, but for the fourth quarter as a whole were up
about 3-1/2 per cent from the third quarter. Sales of the GAF grouping
(general merchandise, apparel, furniture and appliance stores) were
about unchanged in December but were up substantially from a year
earlier. Unit sales of new autos were maintained at very high rates,
also well above a year earlier. Consumer instalment credit outstanding,
which has expanded by record amounts in the past few months, will
undoubtedly show another large increase for December.

I-2
The latest available data support earlier indications of
continued strong expansion in business outlays for fixed capital. The
Commerce survey, released today, shows an increase of 12.9 per cent
in planned outlays for plant and equipment in 1973, a larger rise than
indicated by any of the three private surveys taken last fall. Another
sizable rise in output of business equipment is estimated for December.
In November, manufacturers' new orders for nondefense capital goods
increased further and square footage of contracts awarded for industrial
and commercial building rose sharply to a new high for this year.
There was a large increase in wage rates in December,
according to preliminary data. Since August the earnings index has
risen at an annual rate of 7.8 per cent, well above the rate of advance
earlier in the year. The consumer price index in November rose at a
relatively moderate annual rate of 3.3 per cent, but in December there
was a sharp rise in wholesale prices reflecting an exceptional increase
in prices of farm products and foods. Prices of industrial commodities
were up only a little.
Outlook. For 1973, the staff has again retained the basic
monetary and price-wage control assumptions incorporated in the Chart
Show projection, but is now assuming unified budget expenditures of
$250 billion in fiscal 1973, rather than $253 billion. This change,
however, is assumed to reflect mainly asset sales and technical trans-
actions and therefore is projected to have relatively little effect on
Federal purchases in the NIA accounts.

I -3
As may be seen from the table, current projections have been
raised somewhat from those of four weeks ago. The upward modifications
for 1973 as a whole reflect in part the carrying through of the greater
strength now evident in the fourth quarter of 1972. Growth in real
GNP is still projected to be as rapid in the first quarter as earlier
projected, and to slow thereafter--but less markedly.

So far as demands are concerned, the staff has raised somewhat
its earlier projections of consumer purchases and inventory investment.
Business fixed investment is now projected to rise 15 per cent for 1973
compared to an increase of 13 per cent shown four weeks ago. On the
other hand, residential construction activity is now projected to decline

I-4
more rapidly in the closing quarter than in the projection of four
weeks ago. This revision assumes some additional decline in starts
late in the year resulting from moratorium on Federal subsidy programs.
The fixed weight price index is now projected to rise slightly
more during the year than earlier shown, reflecting mainly prospects
for higher food prices. The unemployment rate is expected to decline
to 4.7 per cent by the fourth quarter, slightly lower than last time
because of the somewhat more rapid real growth now anticipated.

Industrial production. Industrial production is tentatively
estimated to have increased substantially further in December, although
probably less than in November. The total index is estimated to have
advanced at an annual rate of around 11-1/2 per cent from the third to
the fourth quarter and to be about 10 per cent above a year earlier.
Limited data now available indicate that gains in output were widespread
among final products and materials.
Auto assemblies rose 7 per cent in December to an annual
rate of 10.3 million units. Production schedules for January, however,
indicate a decline to about a 9.7 million seasonally adjusted annual
rate. In early December, output of most household appliances was
maintained at the record level prevailing during most of 1972. Pro-
duction worker manhour data suggest another large advance in output of
business equipment. Among materials, production of raw steel increased
9.5 per cent and trade reports indicate another rise in output of alumi-
num. Production of crude oil and paperboard continued at high levels.
Retail sales. The value of retail sales in December was up
only slightly from November, according to the advance Census report.
Durable sales rose slightly with autos up by close to 2 per cent, but
sales of furniture and appliances and other durables were off somewhat.
Nondurable goods sales were about unchanged, as was the GAF grouping.
Despite the slight overall gain in December and a small down-
ward revised November sales figure, for the quarter as a whole retail
sales showed a strong gain of about 3-1/2 percent, Sales of the auto

I-8
group were particularly strong, up by over 4-1/2 per cent, but the
2-1/2 per cent gain in the GAF group was also notable considering the
tendency for sales of this group to move counter to unusual gains in
auto sales.
Unit sales of selected durables. December sales of new
domestic-type autos were at a 9.9 million unit rate, the same as the
average rate in the last half of 1972. Sales were particularly strong
in the last 20 days of the month as all three major producers closed
out sales contests. For 1972 as a whole, a record 9.3 million domestic
type vehicles were sold; the previous record was 8.8 million in 1965.
Dealer inventories were equal to a 45 day supply at the end of December,
about the same as in the previous two months, but 15 per cent below a
year earlier.
Sales of imported cars in December were at a 1.6 million unit
annual rate, down 6 per cent from November, but a third above December
1971 sales which were depressed by dock strikes and currency uncertainties.
For the fourth quarter, sales of imports averaged 1.5 million units,
slightly above earlier quarters in 1972. Import sales for the year 1972
were 1.4 million units, slightly below last year's record. Total new
auto sales amounted to a new record of 10.7 million units.
Sales of domestic-type trucks were at a 2.6 million unit rate
in December, down 10 per cent from a month earlier, but 16 per cent
above a year earlier. For the year 1972, a record 2.5 million domestic-
type trucks were sold, 26 per cent above last year's record level.

I-9
Factory sales of major home appliances, TVs, and radios
increased sharply in the first three weeks of December and were 15
per cent above the comparable November period. Sales of major appliances
rose 9 per cent. TV sales by factories were a fourth above a month
earlier, while radio sales (almost all imports) were 3 per cent below
November.

Construction and real estate. Seasonally adjusted value of
new construction activity, which was revised upward by more than 2
per cent for both October and November, remained at the new record
annual rate of $129 billion in December--the same as the fourth quarter
average. All major sectors showed essentially no month-to-month change
in December. For 1972 as a whole, total outlays were $124 billion--
14 per cent above a year earlier. The increase was nearly as large as
in 1971 when pressures on available resources were appreciably less.

I -10
Construction costs in December, as measured by the Census
composite index, were running 5 per cent above a year earlier, about
the same as for 1972 as a whole. In each of the preceding two years,
the average rise in such costs had been higher, approximating 7 per cent.

Seasonally adjusted private housing starts--revised upward
slightly further for October--were about unchanged in November at the
exceptionally high annual rate of 2.44 million units. Even if, as
expected, some decline occurred in December, the rate in the fourth
quarter as a whole apparently was close to the advanced third quarter
average. Also, the total for the year most likely rounded up to 2.4
million units, compared with 2.05 million last year--the only other year
in which starts exceeded 2 million units in the history of the series.
These data exclude mobile home shipments which, based on present esti-
mates for 1972, also rose--by 15 per cent, to 575,000 units.

Unlike 1971, the rise in starts in 1972 was entirely in
nonsubsidized units. Subsidized starts are currently estimated at
about 100,000 units below the record 448,000 of the previous year. A
moratorium on future commitments for all of HUD's housing subsidy
programs became effective at the close of business on January 5, and a
similar moratorium affecting the related subsidy operations of the
Farmers Home Administration was announced subsequently. However, given
the backlog of commitments already made and other factors, the rate of
subsidized starts will probably not be appreciably changed--at least
over the near term.

I -12
Plant and equipment plans. The Commerce December survey of
1973 spending plans for new plant and equipment indicates that business
expects to increase spending by 12.9 per cent as compared with the
9 per cent rise indicated for 1972. Manufacturers plan a 14 per cent
gain in contrast with a 4 per cent increase in 1972--durable goods
producers expect a larger increase than nondurable goods producers.
In nonmanufacturing, plans are for a 1973 gain of 12.5 per cent,
although transportation firms expect only a 2 per cent gain--largely
due to a reduction in capital spending by airlines.
The results shown in this survey are more optimistic than
those of earlier private surveys.

Manufacturers orders and shipments. New orders for durable
goods rose 3.1 per cent (p) in November, up sharply from the (downward-
revised) 0.2 per cent dip in October. Excluding defense, durable goods
orders were up 2.5 per cent in November. New orders for nondefense
capital goods rose 0.7 per cent in November following an October gain
of 1.8 per cent. The October-November average for new orders for durable
goods was up 4.7 per cent from the third quarter monthly average.
This was a somewhat larger gain than from the second to the third
quarter and was due largely to strengthening of orders for capital
goods, household durables, and construction materials.
Durable goods shipments rose 2.1 per cent in November;
backlogs of unfilled orders also rose with especially large increases
in the primary metals, electrical machinery and non-electrical machinery
industries, and in nondefense capital goods.

Inventories. Book value of manufacturers' inventories rose
at a $6.1 billion annual rate in November, compared with $6.8 billion
in October, and a third-quarter average rate of $7.7 billion. In
October and November taken together, stocks of materials and supplies
increased at a relatively high rate and the increase in work-in-
process inventories accelerated further, but stocks of finished goods
declined. By industry groups, the mild slowdown in book value growth
in these two months was concentrated in consumer goods; inventory
growth accelerated further for both defense and nondefense capital goods.

expansionary period in the spring of 1966.
Unfilled orders for durable goods rose 1.3 per cent in
November, and as a result the ratio of durable goods stocks to unfilled
orders declined slightly further, but this ratio remained well above
levels in earlier expansionary periods.

Cyclical indicators. The Census composite index of leading
indicators rose a strong 1.9 per cent (p) in November. Revisions
for previous months were negligible. The coincident and lagging
composites rose by 1.5 and 1.7 per cent respectively in November.
Leading series increasing in November were the manufacturing
workweek, initial unemployment claims (inverted), new orders for
durable goods, industrial materials prices, common stock prices, and
the ratio of price to unit labor cost. Series declining were con-
tracts and orders for plant and equipment and housing permits. Since
the preliminary index was compiled, a substantial increase has also
been reported in the change in consumer installment debt.

The household survey indicated substantial gains in both labor force
and employment following a small employment advance and a sharp labor
force decline in November. Preliminary payroll employment estimates
for December show little gain over the month following an increase of
280,000 in November (revised upward by 100,000).
Expansion of labor demand has been especially rapid since
mid-year. Much of the recent growth has been in manufacturing with
large employment gains in metal and metal-using industries. The
factory workweek also has increased and, at 41 hours, was up nearly
one hour from December 1971. Outside of manufacturing, employment
advances have continued large in trade, services, and State and
local government.

Unemployment and labor force. The number of jobless
workers remained at 4-1/2 million, seasonally adjusted, in December
as both total employment and the civilian labor force increased by
300,000. Unemployment rates for most groups showed little movement
over the month, with no change for men 25 years and over, married
men and heads of households. The rate for young men 20 to 24
declined, but the teenage rate rose.

in the index for all private nonfarm industries and the estimates
for the preceding two months were also revised up. However, for the
entire period since January 1972 wage rate increases in the private
nonfarm sector averaged 5.9 per cent--significantly less than in the
pre-freeze period.

Wholesale prices. Seasonally adjusted wholesale prices
rose 1.6 per cent between November and December, as prices of farm
and food products soared and those for industrial commodities moved
slightly higher.
The index of farm and food products rose 5.2 per cent
over the month; higher prices were widespread with particularly
large increases for livestock, meat, grains, oilseeds, manufactured
animal feeds, and raw cotton. The rise was largely the result of
unusual weather conditions this fall according to the Department
of Labor--cold and snow, then melting snow and rain--which held up
the harvesting of crops and the marketing of livestock. Also
affecting farm and food prices were increased domestic requirements
for feed, strong export demand for grains, and a smaller supply of
foreign fishmeal which competes with domestic animal feeds based on
oilseeds.
The industrial commodities index increased at a seasonally
adjusted rate of only 0.1 per cent. Substantial seasonally adjusted
increases were reported for motor vehicles and equipment, textile
products, fuels, and metals and metal products. But these were
virtually offset by price declines--the first in about a year--for
hides, skins, and leather products, lumber and wood products, and
machinery and equipment,

highest level since the Korean War period. The increase reflects
strengthening world economic activity as well as short supplies of
such agriculturally-based commodities as high-grade cotton, wool,
and hides. Metals rose 11-1/2 per cent over the year, mainly because
of a rise in prices of steel scrap which reflected increasing activ-
ity in both domestic and foreign steel industries. The textile and
fibers group of the index increased nearly 25 per cent, reflecting
an increase of more than 150 per cent for wool tops and a sharp rise
in prices of cotton print cloth. Among other raw materials, prices

I -22
of cow hides rose more than 150 per cent in 1972, and tallow, rubber,
and rosin also showed substantial increases.
Consumer prices. Consumer prices rose in November at a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.3 per cent to a level 3.5 per
cent above November 1971, as food costs spurted once more. Other
commodity prices advanced at a 1 per cent rate and service costs
increased less than 3 per cent.
The CPI continues to perform considerably better than in
the pre-stabilization period if mortgage costs are excluded. Since
June, food costs have risen rapidly but this has been offset to some
extent by the recent counter-seasonal and, presumably, temporary drop
in auto prices. The most important reason for the slowing in the CPI
has been reductions in the rate of rise in major services such as
rent and medical care.
The recent rise in food prices has been unexpectedly sharp.
Beef and pork prices usually show substantial seasonal declines in
November, but this year beef prices rose and pork fell much less than
expected. Fresh vegetable prices rose sharply and there was a much
less than seasonal drop for eggs. In the twelve-month period ending
November, meat prices jumped more than 12 per cent and accounted for
nearly half of the total rise in food costs; combined with the 10 per
cent climb in fresh fruit and vegetable prices, more than 60 per cent
is accounted for.

Among other commodities, significant advances in November
for apparel and gasoline were offset in part by a further decline
in new car prices following the large drop in October. The main
effect of the increases in car prices approved by the Price Commission
in December may not appear in the index until January, when car
prices usually drop seasonally. Price increases to cover 1972 cost
increases, apart from those associated with Government-mandated
safety and anti-pollution equipment, are not expected before mid-
February.

The index for services in November included a sharp in-
crease for residential gas charges to a level about 5-1/2 per cent
above that in November 1971.
Price change in the CPI and the GNP price indexes, During
the first 12 months of Phase II, from November 1971 to November 1972,
the CPI rose 3.5 per cent, somewhat below its rate of rise in the
eight months prior to the freeze. Some other broad indicators
have shown more deceleration in the rate of price rise and lower
rates of increase in recent months.
The GNP deflator, after a first-quarter surge reflecting
a Federal pay raise, increased at an average annual rate of about 2
per cent in the succeeding three quarters. However, shifts in weights
have tended recently to lower the deflators, and the rise of the fixed-
weight index for GNP averaged about 3 per cent. In the same three

A considerable part of the discrepancy lies in the broader coverage
of the CPI in the consumer durables area. In the gross private product,
only the margins on used car purchases are included and homeownership
costs are not reflected directly; instead the rent index is used as
a proxy for the cost of imputed services of owner-occupied homes. The
CPI, however, includes, with substantial weights, the prices of both
houses and used cars, and these rose faster than other components.
(The November 1972 used car index, for example, was 5.3 per cent above
its level 12 months earlier.) If used cars and home purchase are
excluded, the 12-month increase in the CPI index for durable goods
(confidential), of 1.3 per cent, is the same as the four-quarter
increase in the consumer durables component of the private GNP fixed-
weight index.GNP

The CPI component for services also rose faster than
the PCE measure. This results in part from the inclusion--as part
of home-ownership costs--in the CPI of property taxes (up 10 per
cent over the twelve months ending November 1972) and of mortgage
interest costs (which rose in response to rising house prices). In
addition, discrepancies between the two indexes arise from other
differences in coverage and from the related use of additional data
sources to measure price change for PCE.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL SITUATION
The Federal funds rate has risen about 30 basis points since
the December Committee meeting, but this has been accompanied by quite
moderate increases in most other short- and long-term rates. A signi-
ficant proportion of the early January Treasury bond financing was
acquired by dealers, rather than permanent investors, but this overhang
of securities appears from the most recent figures to have been materi-
ally reduced.
The modest impact of tighter money market conditions on short-
term rates apparently reflects increased demands for short-term financial
assets emanating from reinvestment by State and local governments of
revenue sharing payments, year-end window dressing by institutions,
and investor demand for liquid assets associated with uncertainty about
the interest rate outlook. From the credit demand side, except for
Treasury borrowing and probable strong consumer credit demands in December,
there appears to have been little intensification of market pressures,
Not only was there the normal holiday lull in capital markets, but loan
demands on banks also were less strong than in recent months.
Outlook, Given the higher than expected end-of-year Treasury
balance and an assumed reduction in Federal outlays to the $250 billion
level, Treasury net cash borrowing through April is now expected to be
about $4 1/2 billion, about $2 billion less thn earlier anticipated.
While such borrowing would still be above average for similar past periods,
if the lower figure actually materializes, the Treasury's near-term
demands will not place as much pressure on credit markets as thought at
the time of the December Committee meeting.

II -2
In private securities markets, the forward calendar of issues
continues to indicate modest capital market demands over the next
couple of months, although there are scattered reports of a possible
build-up in the corporate calendar for March-April. Financial markets
in the near-term may also be buoyed by reinvestment of the early
January revenue sharing payment. And, in February, the beginning of
larger than normal refunds to individual income taxpayers is expected
to spill over into somewhat larger deposit growth and reduced net expan-
sion of consumer credit.
These factors tending to moderate interest rate pressures must
be balanced against the projected strong--and perhaps increasing--
short-term business credit demands at banks and a possible step-up in
commercial paper borrowing by nonfinancial corporations. Moreover, the
continued rapid rate of growth in economic activity could sustain the
recent strong demand for money, tipping the balance toward higher short-
term rates. The extent of any sympathetic response of long-term rates
to a rise in short rates will be influenced by the specific proposals
in the forthcoming budget message of the President, by the current Paris
negotiations on Vietnam, and by how wage-price and interest and dividend
control programs evolve. Further increases in market interest rates
could produce increasing caution in mortgage commitment policies of thrift
institutions, as the sustainability of the recent pace of deposit inflows
comes into question.
Monetary Aggregates. After showing relatively modest expan-
sion during the preceding four months, preliminary data indicate that
M1growth accelerated to a record annual rate of 15.3 per cent in

II -3
December. Contributing in part to the rapid December growth--perhaps
about 3 percentage points--was a large contraseasonal increase in
demand deposits held by State and local governments, apparently attri-
butable to the Federal revenue sharing funds disbursed in early December.
Results from an informal Reserve Bank telephone survey of commercial
banks, which will be discussed more fully in an appendix to the Greenbook
Supplement, suggest that little, if any, of the December expansion can
be attributed to the recent change in Regulation J or the implementation
of regional check processing centers. Thus, while factors other than
revenue sharing, accounting for the December acceleration in M cannot
be readily pinpointed, a significant part of the increase was undoubtedly
associated with increasing transaction needs for money stimulated by
rapid economic expansion. The December growth brings the fourth quarter
rate of expansion in M1 to 8.4 per cent, marginally above the 8.1 per
cent rate of increase for the year as a whole.
Inflows of funds into consumer type time and savings accounts
also picked up significantly in December, expanding at a 12.7 per cent
rate. As a result, M2 increased at its most rapid pace since January
of last year. But for the fourth quarter as a whole the growth rate of
M2 was 9.8 per cent--only a little above the third quarter rate and
considerably below the strong first quarter pace. In addition, net
sales of negotiable CD's increased sharply in December, despite a large
volume of scheduled maturities over the December 15 tax payment date.
Increased interest by banks in selling CD's may have reflected in part
the decline in their holdings of Treasury deposits. Some of the increased
CD sales in December, as well as part of the growth in other time accounts,

also may have stemmed from deposits of revenue sharing funds by State
and local governments.1/
The December decline in Treasury deposits was more than offset
by accelerated growth in demand and total time deposits, so that the
bank credit proxy expanded at a 13.8 per cent rate during the month--
only slightly below the high rates reached in the spring.
Bank Credit. Growth in bank credit, as measured on a last-
Wednesday-of-the-month basis, decelerated somewhat from the very high
rate registered in recent months to a seasonally adjusted rate of 11.3
per cent in December, as loan growth and purchases of securities, other
than those of the U.S. government, slowed. The decrease in loan growth
was concentrated primarily in business loans, which rose at an annual
rate of 8.3 per cent in December following unusually strong growth
in November. Despite the slowing, however, loans to public utilities
and metals firms continued to expand rapidly at larger banks, after
rough allowance for seasonal influences, while loans to retail and
wholesale trade concerns were off only slightly.
The erratic pattern of month-to-month changes in business
loans since May suggests that the December slowdown is transitory. For
the fourth quarter as a whole, business loan growth accelerated to an
annual rate of 15.2 per cent from 12.4 per cent in the previous quarter.
1/ At the larger banks during December, the increase in State and
local holdings of CD's and other time deposits attributable to revenue
sharing appears to have been relatively small. But, smaller banks
may have experienced more of an effect than the larger banks, since
revenue sharing checks were widely spread geographically, and many
checks were relatively small in amount.

II -6
With continued growth anticipated for the economy generally, business
loan expansion is expected to remain strong.
Real estate loans and consumer loans continued to expand in
December at the high rates of other recent months. But there were
modest declines in security loans associated with a reduction in security
dealer inventories, and in loans to nonbank financial institutions
reflecting increased reliance by finance companies on commercial paper
financing.

II -7
In the investment component of bank credit, banks significantly
increased their holdings of U.S. government securities, mainly reflecting
two Treasury financings during the month, both authorizing full credit
to tax and loan accounts. Available data suggest that banks outside
New York acquired a larger proportion of the new issues than New York
banks. Bank holdings of other securities showed only a slight rise in
December.

II -8
Nonbank thrift institutions. According to sample data,
net savings flows at nonbank depositary intermediates were maintained
in December at about the same pace recorded in the previous month.
Deposit flows at S&L's continued to slow in December, with California
institutions experiencing an appreciable moderation--reportedly
reflecting depositor needs for funds to pay real estate taxes--and
these S&L's increased borrowings from the FHLB more than seasonally.
December inflows at mutual savings banks, however, accelerated some-
what. Over the fourth quarter as a whole deposit growth remained
high historically, although net inflows moderated at both S&L's and
mutual savings banks. This moderation in flows appears to reflect
the growing relative attractiveness of yields on short-term market
instruments and perhaps the improved climate for equity investment.

Early and limited reports indicate that the thrift institu-
tions are experiencing a relatively favorable reinvestment period,
New York mutual savings banks had only small net outflows during the
three grace days of December and the first business day of January.
Commercial paper outstanding. With outstandings down
much less than usual, commercial paper rose by a substantial $1.3
billion in December on a seasonally adjusted basis. While all
categories of commercial paper contributed to this expansion, most of
the increase was in nonbank directly placed paper issued by finance
company subsidiaries of manufacturers, reflecting continued strong
sales of autos and other durables and apparently reduced reliance
upon bank financing. In the previous month both nonbank directly
placed and dealer placed paper had declined.

As a result of the sizable advance in commercial paper
outstanding in both October and December, the fourth quarter increase
of $1.8 billion accounted for the bulk of the total increase of $2.0
billion for the year as a whole. In 1971, there was a decline of
similar magnitude.
Consumer credit. Reflecting the further strength in consumer
expenditures in November, growth in total consumer credit outstanding
increased at a new record seasonally adjusted annual rate of $25.5 billion.
This growth was nearly 11 per cent larger than the previous record in
October, mainly because of increases in the instalment credit sector.
Growth in instalment credit at a record seasonally adjusted annual
rate of $21.0 billion was broadly based, with increases in automobile
and nonautomotive consumer goods credit reaching new highs. Extensions
of auto credit, reflecting the advanced level of unit sales and the
larger size of sales contracts, were up more than 3 per cent from
October and 16 per cent from November 1971. Gains in nonautomotive
consumer goods financing were even larger with the year-over-year
increase in extensions amounting to 20 per cent in November. Contributing
to their growth were a sharp jump in the average size of contract on
mobile home financing and further expansion in the volume of home furnish-
ings and appliance financing along with the rise in housing completions.
Customer finance rates on new cars financed through dealers
by major finance companies have edged up only slightly from their mid-
summer lows. The weighted average customer rate on new car contracts
in November was 11.89 per cent, compared with 11.84 per cent in July
and 12.06 per cent in November 1971. The recent advance has led to a

II -11
widening of the "dealer rate spread" because the average creditor
finance rate--the rate charged by the finance company on contracts
purchased from dealers--eased to a low of 9.33 per cent in both
October and November. In the case of used cars, customer rates have ad-
vanced nearly all year while rates charged dealers have declined, with
dealer margins advancing over the past 12 months by 54 basis points.

Other long-term security markets. Yields on most types of
long-term securities continued to drift upwards over the last four weeks
in spite of the holiday lull in new issue activity. The rate advances
reflected mainly uncertainty about the war situation, expectations of
tighter monetary policy, and moderately heavy dealer inventory positions.

II -12
There have not been any new readings on the FRB Aaa utility index
since mid-December because of the lack of new issues, but judging from
movements in secondary market rates and reoffering yields on new issues
early this week, the yield on a newly issued Aaa utility bond would
probably be around 7.30 per cent, an increase of about 10 basis points
since the December FOMC meeting. New issue volume in both the corporate
and municipal markets has been seasonally light over the last 4 weeks,
so the level of market rates will be better tested as the market again
becomes active in the next few weeks.
Yields on municipals are up only about 5 basis points on
balance. Casualty companies continue to support the market in the
longer maturity range, but commercial bank purchases are reported to
have moderated recently. Yields on intermediate and long-term Treasury
issues are also about 5 to 10 basis points higher, although most
recently the sizable volume of newly issued Treasury bonds awarded
to non-permanent investors and the resulting weakness in the issue
have also generated some market concern.
The fluctuating probabilities of peace in Vietnam again
appeared to be a major determinant of stock price movements. The market
rally which had begun in mid-October came to a halt in mid-December, with
the stalemate in negotiations and the resumption of massive bombing in
Nort Vietnam. The usual pattern of tax sales in December was probably
also a factor in the stock price decline. Following the announcement of
a temporary cease-fire on December 28, the market began to advance
again.

Trading volume on the major exchanges was tapering steadily
after mid-December but rebounded on the last trading day of the year
with the NASDAQ setting a new daily volume record of 14.4 million shares;
on the NYSE, 27.6 million shares were traded.
Corporate bond volume has not built up so rapidly as expected
in January, and the staff now estimates that public bond offerings for
this month will total about $1.3 billion. Because of an unusually low
level of utility bond filings for February, it is likely that volume
in that month will not be much higher than $1 billion. Underwriters
report some large industrial offerings are tentatively scheduled for

II -14
March or April, and it is anticipated that public bond volume may
increase appreciably in the early Spring. All indications point to a
continued high level of private placement activity. Although filings
of new stock issues appear to have moderated somewhat in the December-
January period, February volume is expected to be close to the $1 billion
level again.

Long-term debt offerings by State and local governments did
not show as much seasonal decline in December as expected. On the
basis of present schedulings the staff estimates that January volume will
also be about $1.8 billion, but the February total may be slightly lower.
In spite of a run-off in public short-term debt securities in
both October and November, there was an estimated increase of about
$200 million in net short-term debt sales by State and local governments
over the fourth quarter. The net increase for the year 1972 is estimated
at about $2 billion, significantly less than in any of the preceding
three years, with improved revenues and capital market conditions
undoubtedly major contributing factors,

Mortgage market. Growth in mortgage debt outstanding accelerated
in the fourth quarter to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of more than
$67 billion, according to preliminary estimates, bringing the year-end
total close to $565 billion. For the full year 1972, mortgage debt
outstanding rose by nearly 13 per cent--the largest percentage increase
since 1955. Most of the fourth quarter expansion apparently continued
to be in residential mortgage debt, with mutual savings banks and Federally
related agencies slightly increasing, and S&L's and commercial banks
slightly decreasing, their respective shares.
Costs of construction financing and mortgage warehousing
credit generally have moved up recently along with other short-term
interest rates. In the primary market for long-term mortgage credit,
average contract interest rates on home loans may have edged slightly
higher in December, based on fragmentary field reports and other

information. In the secondary market-as measured by the latest
(January 8) FNMA bi-weekly auction of forward purchase commitments on
government underwritten home mortgages--yields averaged 7.68 per cent,
up only 1 basis point from the previous two auctions. The volume of
bidding in the auction was quite low.

Short-term interest rates. Despite a significant firming
in the money market which has resulted in a Federal funds rate that
recently averaged a little over 5-5/8 per cent--about 30 basis
points higher than at the time of the December committee meeting--
a calm atmosphere has prevailed in markets for short-term securities,
and short-term rates generally have displayed only a sluggish
response to the higher funds rate. Indeed, the market rate on the
3-month Treasury bill, after declining somewhat following the
Committee meeting, has only returned to its level at the time of the
meeting, and the rate on the 6-month bill has increased only 5 basis
points. Private short-term rates advanced 1/8 to 1/4 of a percentage
point with the 90-119 day commercial paper rate rising to 5-5/8 per
cent. This latter change triggered a rise to 6 per cent in the prime
rate posted by banks adhering to a floating rate policy. And,
subsequently, most other major banks also increased their prime rate
to 6 per cent.
Several factors appear to account for the relatively modest
reaction of short-term rates to tighter money market conditions.
Demands for short-term securities appear to have been strengthened by
continued investment of revenue sharing funds and year end window
dressing. Also, investors may now perceive a greater probability of
a rise in long term interest rates. There is the additional possibility
that the market has not yet fully adjusted to the advancing funds rate,

II -18
with the holiday season and year end churning tending to obscure
trends in market conditions.

Treasury coupon market. Yields on Treasury coupon issues
have edged higher since the December FOMC meeting, with increases
recorded on intermediate-term issues of as much as an eight of a
percentage point and on longer-term issues of about half this amount.
Recent developments in this sector of the market have been influenced
mainly by the Treasury's auctioning of $625 million of a 20-year bond
on January 4. All allotments in this auction were awarded at the 6.79
per cent stop out yield. This was somewhat below earlier expectations
of what the auction yield likely would be, reflecting an unexpectedly
strong demand for the issue, particularly from government securities
dealers and other financial houses which together were awarded nearly
half the issue. The unexpected size of these awards caused the yield
on the issue to rise to about 6.85 per cent in secondary market
trading. Just preceding the payment date, bonds still in professional
hands appear to have been reduced to about $100 million.
Prior to its bond auction, the Treasury had gotten an early
start in meeting its first quarter cash needs by auctioning $2 billion
of a 2-year note on December 20. With full tax and loan account
credit allowed, commercial banks acquired the bulk of this issue on
which the auction yield averaged 5.83 per cent. This was somewhat
below the yield in the previous 2-year note auction, reflecting a
fairly enthusiastic market reception of the issue. However, the yield
on the issue has since risen to somewhat above 6 per cent in secondary

II -20
market trading, even though banks are reported to have retained a
large proportion of their allotments.
Apart from continuing additions to the weekly Treasury bill
auctions, no additional Treasury cash financing is now expected until
early March. In February, however, there will be a quarterly refunding
operation involving $4.8 billion of maturing issues held by the public.
The terms for this financing will be announced around the end of
January.
Federal finance. In view of the Administration's evident
determination to hold fiscal year 1973 outlays to $250 billion, we
have lowered our expenditure projection for the unified budget to that
level from $252 billion. Our receipts projection remains unchanged
at $226.5 billion leaving an estimated deficit in the unified budget
of $23.5 billion for fiscal year 1973. Most of the change in our
projection of expenditures is on a unified budget basis. Of the $2
billion reduction in outlays only $.4 billion appears as a reduction
in expenditures on an NIA basis, which are now projected at $260.2
billion.
Specific information as to the precise methods by which the
Administration will attain its fiscal 1973 expenditure target is not
yet available. Recent Administration announcements and press reports
indicate that the new budget will propose reductions in programs
involving space, health services, and agricultural assistance. It is

II -21
not clear how much these reductions will affect outlays prior to the
end of this fiscal year. However, some impact on fiscal 1973 outlays
is expected from the recently announced freeze on HUD commitments for
subsidized housing and major community development programs. As
reported in the December Greenbook, continued asset sales are also
likely to play a major role.
The end-of-December Treasury cash balance was $11.1 billion,
$4.3 billion higher than estimated by the staff a month ago. About
$2.3 billion of this unexpected increase was attributable to a com-
bination of lower spending and increases in checks outstanding (i.e.
Treasury float). The other $2 billion of the overshoot occurred
because the Treasury's two year quarterly note was paid for in late
December rather than in early January, as had been anticipated. While
the magnitude of the implied December expenditure shortfall exceeded
that necessary to achieve the $250 billion ceiling, the fact that
January expenditures are running high indicates that some of the
December reduction may be due to delays in spending rather than to
absolute reductions.

Summary and outlook. As the year ended there was the usual
flurry of capital inflows to meet year-end positioning requirements.
Nevertheless, the official settlements deficit probably amounted to
about $1-1/2 billion (seasonally adjusted) for the fourth quarter and
$10-1/2 billion for the year. Activity in the exchange markets during
December was relatively uneventful. The market for the yen seemed to
cool off and the forward premium was reduced.
During the fourth quarter there were two main offsetting
features in the U.S. balance of payments. The first was the increase
in the trade deficit in November, which was a matter for concern
mainly because imports of manufactures showed some increase after
having levelled off during the summer. On the other hand, foreign
net purchases of U.S. corporate stocks may have reached $1 billion
in the fourth quarter, a record pace.
In the year past there were several major shifts in trade
balances among countries. The trade deficit of the U.S. increased
sharply, of course, as did that of the U.K. Most other industrial
countries increased their exports relative to imports, including
Japan and Germany whose revaluations were the largest. However, the
trade surplus of the industrial countries as a whole with the rest
of the world, which had been above normal in 1971 as a result of

III -2
cyclical slackin demand, fell sharply in 1972, spurred by a cyclical
upturn that was well under way by the latter part of 1972 in Europe
and Japan.
In the period ahead the principal focus of attention will
be the U.S. trade balance. It remains to be seen whether the November
setback is a temporary interruption in the trend of improvement since
June,or instead,reflected the start of a new surge in imports stemming
from the faster increase in U.S. overall demand. Similarly, the pace
of foreign purchases of U.S. corporate stocks since September is so
far above previous experience that it may not be sustainable much
longer, though inflows should be substantial as long as the U.S. economic
performance looks relatively good and confidence in the dollar holds
steady.
Foreign exchange markets. Exchange markets were fairly quiet
over the past few weeks, with the dollar generally firmer against major
foreign currencies, particularly during the first week of January,
following a rise in dollar interest rates.
The French franc weakened considerably during December,
primarily on the basis of political opinion polls in France which
showed the leftist coalition stronger than the current government.
In early January, however, the polls reported a turnaround in favor
of the government, and the franc responded by posting a moderate
advance in the exchanges. President Pompidou, in a press conference
on January 9, cited the basic strength of the French balance of payments

III -3
and noted that the government had, in fact, considered a revaluation
of the franc as part of its anti-inflation program announced in early
December. This "talking up" of the franc seemed to have the desired
effect, as the franc firmed sharply on that day and continued its
advance the next day.
The Swiss franc firmed steadily in the last two weeks of
December in response to a more-than-seasonal tightening of the Swiss
money market, this despite the $1.2 billion in swap operations con-
ducted by the National Bank over year-end. The Swiss franc moved to
very near its upper limit on December 27, and though it eased sub-
sequently, it is still within 1/4 per cent of its ceiling rate.
The Italian lira declined rather sharply against the dollar
in early January, dragging the Belgian franc and the Danish krona along
with it as a result of intervention under the EC narrow band arrangement.
(The exemption which had permitted the Bank of Italy to support the
lira while still above the floor of the "tunnel" with sales of dollars
rather than other EC currencies expired on December 31.) Intervention
support of the lira against Belgian francs and Danish krone amounted
to roughly $40 million equivalent in the first week of January.
The Canadian dollar, which had reached a low of around 99.80
U.S. cents on December 7, rebounded by nearly a full cent over the
following two weeks, then dropped back below 100 U.S. cents briefly
in early January as U.S. dollar interest rates rose. Between December 7
and January 9, the Bank of Canada purchased, net, U.S. $123 million.

III -4
The Japanese yen moved off its ceiling in late December for
the first time in several months. On January 4, it moved back to the
ceiling only to ease off again. In recent days the Bank of Japan has
sold a nominal amount of dollars. To the extent that the increased
demand for dollars in Tokyo has reflected increased U.S. dollar interest
rates, this newfound strength of the dollar may not be long-lasting.
On January 9 the Bank of Japan increased reserve requirements of domestic
commercial banks, a move prompted by the acceleration of inflation in
Japan.
Euro-dollar market. Interest rates in the Euro-dollar market
have been subjected to further upward pressure in the past four weeks,
caused by the rise in short-term rates in the United States as well as
continued increases in money market rates in Britain and France. However,
the movement of Euro-dollar rates of different maturities has been quite
mixed. The overnight rate moved up markedly in the last week of December,
and averaged 5.89 per cent in the week ending January 10 compared with
4.69 per cent in the week of December 13. This rise considerably
exceeded the rise in the U.S. Federal funds rate. As a result, on most
of the first ten days of January the cost to U.S. banks (including agencies
and branches of foreign banks) of reserve-free overnight Euro-dollars
was above the Federal funds rate, the first time since last August that
the differential has been in this direction.
In contrast to the overnight rate, the rates for 1-month and
3-month Euro-dollars have declined slightly since the first week of

December, in accordance with the normal seasonal pattern, although in
the latest week they did firm slightly. With CD rates in the United
States advancing, the higher cost of 1- and 3-month Euro-dollars relative to
comparable maturities of CD's has diminished.
U.S. banks' liabilities to their own foreign branches were reduced
from a daily average of $2.0 billion in the first half of December to $1.8
billion in the week ended January 4. Foreign liabilities of New York
agencies and branches of foreign banks were also sharply lower on January 3
compared with Wednesday levels in December.

Balance of payments. Large capital inflows occurred in the
closing days of 1972 as U.S. corporations brought back funds from
abroad to comply with OFDI regulations. A large reduction in lia-
bilities to foreigners reported by U.S. agencies and branches of
foreign banks may also reflect year-end adjustments of positions. Also,
the U.K. made its year-end debt service payments. As a consequence,
the overall balances on both the official settlements and liquidity
bases recorded large surpluses in the week ended January 3.
For the fourth quarter, the seasonally adjusted balances were
in deficit -- about $1-1/2 billion on the official settlements basis
and about $2 billion on the liquidity basis. For the year 1972 it
appears that the official settlements deficit was over $10-1/2 billion
and the liquidity deficit about $13-1/2 billion. The difference between
the two deficits is largely accounted for by borrowings from their
head offices by U.S. agencies and branches of foreign banks.
These deficits, large though they were, remained far below
the extraordinarily high levels of 1971, when the deficits on the
official settlements and liquidity bases were $30 billion and $24
billion, respectively. The main difference, of course, was the absence
of massive recorded and unrecorded capital outflows in 1972; the balance
on goods and services worsened by about $5 billion. The 1972 balance
on current account and long-term capital was apparently of the order
of magnitude of $8 to $10 billion, or about the same as in 1971, and
larger than in any earlier year.

There are few details available on fourth quarter developments.
As noted below, the trade deficit in October-November was only marginally
less than in the third quarter. A major positive element in the fourth
quarter was the large amount of U.S. corporate stocks purchased by
foreigners. Purchases in October were nearly $300 million and then
rose to nearly $500 million in November. December purchases are
tentatively estimated to have been about $300 million. The estimated
$1 billion of U.S. stocks purchased by foreigners in the fourth quarter
would be equal to total purchases in the first three quarters of 1972.
(The heavy purchases in recent months may include an element of catch-up
from the rather low rate of foreign purchases in the March-July period.)
On the side of capital outflows, U.S. bank-reported claims
on foreigners increased sharply in November, including a sizable increase
in claims on Japan largely by Japanese agencies in the United States.
Of the increase in claims by banks reporting under the VFCR program, a
sizable part was customers' funds. Weekly data show further large
increases in claims on foreigners in December.
U.S. foreign trade. The U.S. trade deficit in November rose
steeply, reversing the gradual month-to-month decline in the deficits
that had begun in June. The rise in imports in November accelerated to
5 percent, while exports increased by a more moderate 2 percent. For
the two months October-November, the trade deficit was at an annual
rate of nearly $6-1/4 billion (balance of payments basis), about the
same level as in the third quarter. For January-November the deficit

III -8
was at an annual rate of $6-3/4 billion, about $4 billion more than in
calendar 1971.
The rise in November imports was much more broadly based by
commodity categories than in recent months. Imports of industrial
materials continued to advance, but, in addition, imports of finished
goods, which had leveled off since mid-year, turned up sharply.
Imports of capital equipment were particularly strong, and imports of
both durable and nondurable consumer goods were also higher. Monthly
trade movements are typically volatile, and the November import spurt
may not be sustained. However, there is a question whether the
continuing rapid growth in U.S. economic activity, while foreign
suppliers still have ample capacity, may now be triggering increased
imports not only of industrial materials but also of manufactured
goods. One important domestic development in November, and also in
December, was the rise in sales of imported cars in the U.S. market.
This was apparently not yet reflected in November imports, but may show
up in December.
The increase in exports in November was about equally divided
between agricultural and nonagricultural goods. The value of shipments
of agricultural commodities rose to an extraordinarily high annual rate
of nearly $11 billion, boosted by further price increases in wheat, rice,
corn and soybeans. Exports to the Soviet Union did not increase and
were at the same value as in the two preceding months. Only about

III -9
20 percent of the estimated $1-1/4 billion of grains and soybeans
purchased by Russia has been exported through November. An acceleration
in shipments was reported in December, however, following the Maritime
Agreement reached at the end of November. It is questionable whether
transportation facilities will permit much further expansion in the
volume of total agricultural exports in the coming months above present
rates; the value of shipments, however, may continue to increase because
of higher prices.
Machinery exports rose in November, continuing their advance
of the past several months. Foreign orders for U.S. machinery dipped
in November from the very high average level of the four preceding months
but were still relatively large. Exports of industrial materials in
November fell back from the high October level and shipments of
automotive equipment to Canada were unusually low in November, but
these two categories of exports should increase in the coming months
as output abroad expands, and as assemblies of cars in Canada (with
U.S. components) increase in response to the boom in U.S. car sales.

OECD balance of payments in 1972: current account. The
combined current account surplus of OECD countries (OECD Europe, Japan,
Australia, Canada, and the United States) with the non-OECD world appears
to have dimished sharply in 1972 by nearly $4 billion, from about $7-1/4
billion in 1971 to about $3-1/2 billion last year. The figures for 1972
are based on estimates made by the OECD Secretariat in November 1972,
together with revisions we have made in the light of more recent data.
(See Table 1.) This swing reflects mainly the 1970-71 recession in the
industrial countries, followed by renewed expansion in those countries
in 1972.
Three OECD countries--the United States, the United Kingdom,
and Canada--experienced sharp increases in imports relative to exports
in 1972. The current account deficit of the United States rose from
less than $3 billion in 1971 to over $8 billion last year. Britain's
current account surplus of about $2.5 billion in 1971 gave way to
approximate balance last year. In Canada, the current account moved
from a surplus of $340 million in 1971 to a deficit of about $700
million in 1972.
While over half of these negative changes was counterbalanced
by positive changes for Japan, Australia, and Continental European
countries, the substantial remainder reflected relative growth of
exports of non-OECD countries.
In several instances, current account movements last year
were in the opposite direction from that which the realignment of

exchange rates at the end of 1971 was intended to produce over the long
run. This resulted from a combination of cyclical factors and the
initial perverse terms of trade effect following parity changes. Because
of movements in the trade balance, Japan's surplus, and that of Germany,
rose following the net revaluation of the yen and the mark, while the
U.S. deficit increased after the devaluation of the dollar. In the case
of Britain, the deterioration of the trade balance was a major factor in
the abandonment of the central rate for sterling--the pound was floated
at the end of June--established by the Smithsonian agreement.
As is evident from Table 1, the decrease in the current account
surplus of the OECD countries with the rest of the world in 1972 restored
the balance to a level more in line with the average in recent years.
But this reduction was accomplished by an exceptionally large increase
in the trade deficit of the OECD with the rest of the world, reflecting
both a surge in the volume of imports from non-OECD countries--resulting
mainly from the cyclical upturn in much of the OECD area, and particularly
in North America, last year--and steep rises in the dollar prices of
major commodities exported by these countries. The worsening of the
trade balance was also associated with a slowing in the growth of OECD
exports to the rest of the world last year. This development was possibly
a consequence of the reduced export earnings in 1971 of the non-oil
producing countries outside the OECD, attributable in part to the steep
fall in commodity prices in that year.

III -13
The trade deficit of the OECD exclusive of Australia--which
in the next several paragraphs will be counted as a non-OECD country
because of lack of necessary statistical data--rose to an annual rate
of about $6 billion for the first three quarters of 1972 from only
$1.2 billion in 1971. (These figures are calculated from exports f.o.b.,
imports c.i.f. for Europe and Japan, and imports f.o.b, for the United
States and Canada.) However, a significant amount of this change
reflected a decline in exports to Australia and the increase in the
dollar value of Australian exports to the OECD. The OECD trade account
with the less developed countries alone--that is, non-OECD countries
excluding Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Eastern Europe, the
Soviet Union and China--deteriorated by only a little over $3 billion
between 1971 and 1972--approximately $1 billion accounted for by OECD
Europe, $1.5 billion by the United States, $500 million by Canada and
$200 million by Japan.
The dollar value of OECD imports from the rest of the world
was 16 per cent higher in the first three quarters of 1972 than in the
corresponding period of 1971. The increase in such imports between
1970 and 1971 had been only 11 per cent. The rise in imports from non-
OECD countries was most marked in the United States and Canada, where
demand was expanding fastest. In both cases the increase from January-
September 1971 to January-September 1972 was about 20 per cent. OECD
European and Japanese imports from non-OECD countries rose by 14 and 16
per cent, respectively, between these two periods.

III -14
The rate of growth of exports from the OECD to the rest of
the world fell from 11 per cent in 1971 over 1970 to 8 per cent for
the first three quarters of 1972 compared to the first three quarters
of 1971. OECD exports to the LDC's--which account for the bulk of the
OECD's exports to the rest of the world--increased by only about 7-1/2
per cent between these two periods, compared to an increase in 1971 of
over 12 per cent.
Canadian and American exports to non-OECD countries increased
the least, rising by less than 1 per cent between January-September 1971
and January-September 1972, down from an increase of almost 4 per cent
in 1971. Over this same period, Japanese exports outside the OECD
increased by 11 per cent as compared with 23 per cent a year earlier.
The rate of growth of OECD Europe's exports to the rest of the world
appears to have held steady at about 11 per cent in both 1971 and 1972.
A brief summary of important balance-of-payment developments
in major OECD countries follows:
The German current account surplus increased slightly in 1972--
to about $300 million from $170 million in 1971--but remained much
smaller than in earlier years.
The deficit on services and transfers increased substantially
in 1972, but this change was more than offset by a rise in the trade sur-
plus of about $1.6 billion.
The seasonally adjusted current account registered a large
surplus in the first quarter but fell to a position of approximate

III -15
balance in the second and third quarters, as the trade surplus declined
and services and transfers continued to record large deficits. However,
reflecting mainly a surge in exports dating from August, the seasonally
adjusted current account returned to surplus in the fourth quarter.
Virtually all of the rise in exports in the second half was attributable
to increases in volume.
German foreign exchange reserves increased by about $5 billion
in 1972--exceeding the current account surplus by a large margin. The
difference was due to heavy net capital inflows--most of which took
place during the sterling and dollar crises of mid-June to mid-July.
Since mid-July, German official reserves have declined, as capital began
to flow out in the second half of the year. The restoration of confi-
dence in the dollar in conjunction with earlier measures by the German
authorities to discourage or prohibit capital inflows of various sorts
played a major role in bringing about the turnaround in the capital
account.
The deterioration in the United Kingdom's current account in
1972 was reflected almost entirely in a change in the trade account from
a surplus of about $700 million in 1971 to a deficit of about $1.6
billion last year. The surplus on invisibles was quite stable, falling
probably by less than $200 million.
The trend of British imports, as economic activity recovered
sharply in that country, was very steep in 1972, so that imports for
the year as a whole were about 16 per cent higher than in 1971. The

III -16
trend of exports, meanwhile, was relatively flat (abstracting from
temporary factors), with exports in 1972 only 4 per cent above the
previous year. The poor trade performance reflected a loss of competi-
tiveness arising from the high rates of price inflation, and also weak
demand in the sterling area.
A price freeze was imposed in November which, in conjunction
with the downward float of the pound, was designed to stop--if not
reverse--the deterioration of Britain's competitive position.
The French current account is thought to have improved last
year by about $250 million, mainly through a rise in the trade surplus.
The trade surplus actually decreased in the first half--primarily
because of a bunching of imports of aircraft and oil--but is estimated
to have improved in the second half. The third quarter results were
slightly better than the average for the first half, and large sur-
pluses were achieved in October and November.
Italy's current account surplus in 1972, measured on a trans-
actions basis, apparently was little changed from the surplus in 1971
of $1.85 billion. The seasonally adjusted surplus totalled about $1.5
billion during the first half, but fell sharply thereafter. This re-
sulted mainly from a slackening in the rise in exports, and a decline
in recorded tourist receipts and emigrant remittances. Tourists and
Italian workers abroad have purchased larger quantities of Italian
banknotes abroad since early July, when it was ruled that exported

III -17
banknotes could no longer be returned to Italy for conversion. The
current account deterioration caused by this development is thus matched
by a reduction in recorded capital outflows, so that the overall balance
of payments is unaffected.
The 1972 current account surplus on an exchange-record basis
was almost certainly lower than in 1971. In July-October, the trade
account in exchange-record terms was very adversely affected by an
acceleration of import payments, caused by fear that the lira might be
devalued. Such fear also stimulated heavy capital outflows in the
second half, so that the overall Italian balance of payments was in
deficit last year. Italian official net foreign assets fell by about
$800 million during the year.
The current account of the Netherlands is estimated to have
improved by almost $1.2 billion in 1972, to a surplus of about $1
billion from a deficit in 1971 of $170 million. There was a rise in
the surplus in services, but the bulk of the change was accounted for
by an enormous improvement in the trade account. Imports in the first
nine months of 1972 increased by 12-1/2 per cent over the same period
in 1971, while exports rose by 19 per cent between these two intervals.
The rapid expansion of exports reflects the revival of economic activity
in the Netherlands' main markets. The slow rate of import growth may
have reflected the low level of capital investment last year.

Belgium's current account surplus (on a transactions basis)
may have increased by about $500 million last year, from $650 million
in 1971. This resulted mainly from merchandise trade, which during
the first nine months of last year was in surplus by almost $300 million
compared to a deficit of about $200 million in the same period in 1971.
Despite the higher trade balance, Belgium's overall balance of payments
surplus last year was apparently considerably lower than the $400
million surplus in 1971. There was a sharp fall last year in foreign
direct investment and a large increase in net purchases of foreign
securities by Belgian residents.
Japan's current account surplus appears to have been almost
$6-1/2 billion last year, up from the 1971 surplus of about $5.8 billion.
The trade surplus probably rose by about $1 billion. The dollar value
of exports rose by an estimated 18 per cent, compared to an average of
23 per cent in 1968-71. The increase in volume was only about 8 per
cent, however, only half the 1968-71 average. The slowdown reflects
the impact of both the revaluation and the voluntary export restraints
instituted in Japan last year.
The dollar value of imports rose by an estimated 20 per cent
in 1972 compared to 1971--well in excess of the 14 per cent annual
average increase in 1968-71. The high rate of increase last year re-
sulted in part from the rise in the dollar prices of imports in the
wake of the revaluation and increases in commodity prices, particularlyIII -18

III -19
wool. It was also a reflection of the recovery from the cyclically
reduced level of imports in much of 1971.
In line with the post-war trend, the deficit on invisibles
rose again last year, by about $400 million. The increase included
extra payments for freight during the seamen's strike and a special
payment to the United States for certain physical facilities in Okinawa.
Japanese foreign exchange reserves as officially reported
rose by $3.1 billion during 1972, but it is believed that the Japanese
authorities under-reported reserve gains by $4 or $5 billion.
The decline in the Canadian current account from a surplus
of $340 million in 1971 to a deficit of about $700 million last year
was almost entirely accounted for by a deterioration in the trade sur-
plus from $2.2 billion to an estimated $1.3 billion. Imports in 1972
were about 20 per cent higher in 1972 than 1971, while exports increased
by about 11 per cent.
The rapid expansion of the Canadian economy contributed to
the large rise in imports. Furthermore, the decline in the trade sur-
plus may indicate the delayed impact on Canadian trade of the appreciation
of the Canadian dollar since the initiation of the float in May 1970.
Australia apparently registered an increase of about $1.1
billion in its current account last year, moving from a deficit of about
$900 million to a surplus of about $200 million. The change was brought
about by an increase in the trade surplus, attributable to an exceptional

III -20
absolute decline in imports of about 4 per cent--reflecting the
Australian recession last year--and a rapid expansion of exports of
about 17 per cent.
The current account improvement was accompanied by a con-
tinuation of heavy capital inflows. As a result, Australia's foreign
exchange reserves increased by $2.4 billion last year, bringing total
reserves to almost $6 billion.
In response to the large balance of payments surplus and the
vast accumulation of reserves, the new Australian government revalued
the Australian dollar on December 22 by an effective 7.05 per cent.
Existing measures to control capital inflows were strengthened at the
same time.
