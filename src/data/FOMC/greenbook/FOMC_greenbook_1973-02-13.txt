Prefatory Note  
 
 
The attached document represents the most  complete and accurate version available 
based on original copies culled from the f iles of the FOMC Secretariat at the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve Syst em.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization proce ss which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain. 
 Please note that some material may have b een redacted from this document if that 
material was received on a confidential ba sis.  Redacted material is indicated by 
occasional gaps in the text or by gray boxe s around non-text content.  All redacted 
passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable provisions of the Freedom of 
Information Act.           
 
   
 
    
 
                                                            
 
1  In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic 
format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to rem ove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing). 
 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optical character recognition computer program (OCR) 
first created electronic text from the document im age.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, 
staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.  Pl ease note that the numbers and text in charts and 
tables were not reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff.

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Economic activity has continued to expand vigorously in early
1973, although apparently not so rapidly as in the exceptionally strong
fourth quarter. The staff is projecting an increase in real GNP at an
annual rate of 6-1/2 per cent this quarter following an 8-1/2 per cent
rate of increase last quarter.
In January, industrial production and nonfarm payroll employ-
ment showed further gains, but for both measures, the increases in
December and January were smaller than in most other recent months.
The unemployment rate edged down to 5.0 per cent from 5.1 per cent in
December, and was at the lowest level since mid-1970.
Consumer and business demands have continued expansive.
Retail sales are estimated to have risen appreciably in January, follow-
ing little change in December. Unit sales of autos increased to new
record levels last month, with the total at an annual rate of close to
12.5 million. In the business area, output of business equipment con-
tinued to rise strongly in January, and new orders for nondefense
capital goods rose substantially further in December. Book value of
manufacturers' inventories rose considerably in December, while stock-
sales ratios remained close to the low levels reached in recent months.
Wage rates in January increased less than in December, but
the rate of advance since August, at an annual rate of 7.3 per cent, was
still well above that earlier in the year. Productivity growth slowed
somewhat in the fourth quarter, and, with compensation per manhour up
sharply, unit labor costs rose appreciably after two quarters of no
increase.

I-2
The private GNP fixed weight price index increased at an
annual rate of 3.3 per cent in the fourth quarter. The consumer price
index in December rose at an annual rate of only 2.6 per cent, with
food prices unchanged from November. But prices at the farm level were
up very sharply in both December and January, suggesting the likelihood
of substantial increases in retail food prices in the early months of
this year.
Outlook. The staff has made significant changes for 1973 in
some of its basic economic assumptions:
(1) Monetary policy is now assumed to be somewhat
more restrictive. Growth in the monetary aggregates overtime
is now projected to be consistent with expansion in M1 at an
annual rate around 5 per cent. Short-term market
rates are expected to rise further from current levels, which
are higher than had been anticipated earlier.
(2) Federal expenditures are projected to be consistent
with the recently released budget estimates for fiscal years
1973 and 1974. This change has resulted in a somewhat
slower growth in total Federal expenditures during calendar
1973 than had been projected before. The composition of these
expenditures has also been revised; Federal purchases rose
more rapidly than previously projected and other expenditures--
such as transfers and grants--increase more slowly.

I-3
(3) Phase III controls are incorporated into the
projection for the first time. Given recent wage and price
developments, increases in both are now expected to be
somewhat larger than earlier projected, partly because of
the institution of more flexible controls under Phase III.
The over-all effects of these changes in assumptions, as well
as of other recent developments, may be seen in the table. Nominal
GNP is about unchanged from the projection of four weeks ago. However,
a little more of the increase is now represented by price and a little
less by real output. This downscaling in real expansion is most
evident in the second half of the year when the more restrictive mone-
tary policy now assumed operates, after a lag, to dampen real expansion.
In the fourth quarter, real growth is now projected at an annual rate
of 4.0 per cent.

The faster rise in prices now projected for 1973 follows
from several considerations. A first quarter bulge is now expected
because of a sizable increase in retail food prices already in train,
the rise in social security taxes effective January 1, and the faster
initial price adjustments indicated under Phase III. Over the remainder
of 1973 a somewhat faster rise in unit labor costs is expected to
exert further upward pressure on prices. The unemployment rate is
still projected to decline a little from the January level, to 4.7
per cent in the fourth quarter.

Industrial production. Industrial production is tenta-
tively estimated to have increased about one-half per cent further
in January, following a 10.8 per cent annual rate of increase in
the last half of 1972. Gains in output occurred in some industries
in January, but auto assemblies were cut.
Production of business equipment and of ordance at privately
owned plants apparently rose further in January. Output increases
were also indicated in some household appliances, room air condi-
tioners, consumer staples, and some materials--mainly aluminum and
paper. Production of raw steel and crude oil changed little
continuing at high levels, and production worker manhour data indicate
a continued low level of activity in the aircraft industry. Auto
assemblies declined 6 per cent from the unusually high December
annual rate of 10.3 million units to about a 9.7 million unit rate
in January. Production schedules for February indicate little change
in auto output from January.
Although both the average workweek and total manhours of
manufacturing production workers declined in the January reporting
week, available weekly production date indicate some increase in
manufacturing output for the month as a whole.
Retail sales. Sales in January, on the basis of weekly
data for the four weeks ending January 27, increased about 2 per
cent from the December level. All major categories appear to have

I -8
contributed to the higher volume, with the largest increases in the
food, general merchandise, and furniture and appliance groups.
Unit sales of consumer durables. January sales of new
domestic-type autos were at a 10.3 million unit rate, 4 per cent
above December and 16 per cent above year-earlier levels. Continued
strong sales, including a 10.4 million unit annual rate in the last
10-day period, were achieved even without any sales incentive
contests. Sales of imported cars in January were also exceptionally
strong, at a 2.0 million unit rate, continuing their recent rise.
January factory sales of major home appliances apparently
increased sharply from December levels. All appliances in the index
showed gains with sales of dishwashers, freezers, refrigerators, and
electric ranges particularly strong.

Consumer surveys. The latest surveys by the Michigan
Survey Research Center (SRC), Conference Board, and the Census Bureau
suggest that expenditures will remain strong but that there may be
some weakening in consumer expectations.

I -9
Purchase plans for appliances were strong in both the
Census Conference Board surveys. The Census Bureau also found many
households planning to purchase furniture and carpets and to make
home improvements. Buying plans for houses continued at very high
levels in both of these surveys, but they found conflicting outlooks
of auto purchases.
The Michigan index of sentiment declined slightly; all
questions on present and expected income, business conditions, and
market conditions for consumer durable goods, contributed to the
decline. The Conference Board also reported a deterioration in
expectations of improvement in business conditions and in income
and fewer families in the Census Bureau survey expected higher
incomes.
There is some evidence in the Michigan survey that consumer
response to rising prices may be changing from making some inflationary-
induced purchases to a mood of more caution, reflecting concern with
rising prices of essentials. Price considerations were mentioned
much less frequently as a reason why the present was a good time to
buy durables or houses. Fewer respondents thought that the government
would be successful in reducing inflation and more families were
expecting the rate of inflation to be greater over the next 12 months.
Prices were mentioned by 23 per cent of the respondents in November-
December as a reason for not being better off financially, as compared
to only 15 per cent in August-September.

I -10
Construction and real estate. Seasonally adjusted value of
new construction activity in January edged up from December to a new
high annual rate of over $130 billion. Outlays for private construction
tended higher, as residential construction held at about the record
pace achieved in December and nonresidential construction outlays moved
up somewhat further. Public construction remained just below its
improved fourth quarter average.
The Census Bureau's composite index of construction costs in
January was unchanged from December at 141 per cent of the 1967 average
and was 4.4 per cent above a year earlier. This rise compared with a
year-over-year increase of 8 per cent in January of 1972 and of more
than 5 per cent in the year 1972 as a whole.

Seasonally adjusted private housing starts in December were
at an advanced annual rate of 2.39 million units--only slightly below
the average for the fourth quarter as a whole, which was exceeded only
by the record first quarter of 1972. For the year, total starts rounded
to 2.4 million units, up 15 per cent from 1971, the first year in which
starts had ever exceeded the 2 million mark. Mobile home shipments
accounted for an additional 572,000 units, up from 497,000 in 1971.
The December starts pace, which was stronger than expected,
was associated with a marked acceleration by builders operating under
HUD's multifamily subsidy programs, apparently in response to rumors of
the imminence of a freeze on new commitments. Since the freeze did not
become effective until after January 5, this type of anticipatory response
may also have influenced the rate of starts in that month as well. Even
so, given the extraordinary pace of starts already achieved and other
factors, some decline in the rate of starts may occur during the present
quarter.

Vacancy rates on residential rental properties, which had
advanced to an average of 5.8 per cent of available stocks in the
third quarter of 1972, dipped in the fourth quarter to 5.6 per cent.
This was no higher than a year earlier and well below the peak in the
fourth quarter of 1965. Vacancy rates on homeowner properties in the
fourth quarter also averaged the same as a year earlier. Demands for
all types of shelter have increased substantially over the recent period
and removals are indicated to have remained very high. However, an
important factor in the relatively low vacancy rate pattern at this
time has been the lag between completions and starts. This lag has
apparently increased as heavy pressure on available resources for
residential building continued. Thus, while completions approached
a record 2 million units last year, they were still appreciably below
the number of starts.

Manufacturers orders and shipments. New orders for durable
goods declined 0.9 per cent (p) in December, following a 2.3 per cent
rise in November. Excluding defense, durable goods orders were off
0.3 per cent. However, new orders for nondefense capital goods rose
more rapidly, 2.1 per cent, in December than in November. For the fourth
quarter as a whole, new orders for durable goods were up 4.3 per cent
from the third quarter, a larger gain than in the third quarter. Orders
for nondefense capital goods, household durables, and construction
materials strengthened noticeably.
Durable goods shipments fell 1.1 per cent in December. Back-
logs of unfilled orders rose further with large increases in the motor
vehicles and parts industry and in nondefense capital goods, to the
highest level since December 1969.

Inventories. Book value of manufacturers' inventories
rose at a $9.7 billion annual rate in December (p). The November
rate was revised downward somewhat. For the fourth quarter as a
whole, the rate was $7 billion, a little below the third quarter rate.
In the fourth quarter, manufacturers accelerated the
buildup of work in process and expanded inventories of materials and
supplies at a slightly slower pace than in the third quarter, but
sales were increasing rapidly and stocks of finished goods declined.
By industry groups, the buildup of both defense and nondefense
capital goods inventories accelerated, while growth of inventories
held by producers of consumer goods and materials was slower.
Book value of wholesale inventories also increased strongly
in December; the fourth quarter increase, at $4.5 billion, was a
little higher than the third,

Cyclical indicators. The Census composite index of leading
indicators rose strongly in December--by 2.2 per cent (p). The
October and November increases were both revised up about half a per
cent, reflecting upward revisions in net business formation, which
reached new highs. From September to December, the leading composite
index advanced 5.6 per cent, compared with a 3.5 per cent increase
over the preceding three months.
The coincident index rose 0.6 per cent in December and the
lagging index rose 1 per cent.
Leading series increasing in December were the manufactur-
ing workweek, initial claims for unemployment insurance (inverted),
housing permits, industrial materials prices, common stock prices, and

I -16
the ratio of price to unit labor cost. Series declining were new
orders for durable goods and contracts and orders for plant and
equipment. Since the December index was compiled, there has been
reported some upward revision in new orders and a slight decline in
the change in consumer instalment debt.

Labor market. The unemployment rate edged down 0.1 percentage
point in January to 5.0 per cent, seasonally adjusted. Both total employ-
ment (household series) and the labor force declined during the month.
(The December unemployment rate was revised to 5.1 per cent from 5.2
per cent as a result of the annual revision of seasonal adjustment
factors.)
Labor demand has been quite strong since mid-1972, although
growth of nonfarm payroll employment in the last two months has been a
little less rapid than earlier. Preliminary estimates indicate that
payroll employment increased by 200,000 in January, and the December
level was revised up to show a gain of 125,000. Compared to a year ago,
payroll employment in January was up 2.7 million with a particularly
large gain in manufacturing. Factory employment, however, was still
more than 800,000 below its mid-1969 peak. Employment continued growing
over the year at a substantial pace in trade, services and State and
local government.

The factory workweek fell half an hour in January, according
to preliminary estimates. Declines were widespread, but were apparently
related to unseasonable weather and fuel shortages in some sections of
the country during the reporting period. Factory overtime hours also
dropped, but were still considerably higher than a year ago.
Unemployment and labor force. Although the over-all unemploy-
ment rate was little changed in January, jobless rates for teenagers,
Negroes, and part-time workers dropped sharply. The over-all unemployment
rate has declined by about one percentage point from a year ago to the
lowest level since mid-1970.

After increasing quite rapidly in late 1971 and early 1972,
civilian labor force growth has slowed considerably since
late summer due to reductions among part-time workers. Since August the
full-time labor force has increased by about half a million while the
part-time labor force has declined by an equal amount.

I -19
Productivity and costs. Reflecting the speed-up in the
rate of increase of hourly earnings during the last part of 1972,
compensation per manhour rose quite rapidly in the fourth quarter--
about 7-1/2 per cent for the private nonfarm economy--considerably
faster than in the previous two quarters. At the same time, although
productivity in the nonfarm economy continued to rise faster than
trend in the fourth quarter--at a 4.3 per cent annual rate--the
increase was less rapid than earlier in the year. Consequently, unit
labor costs rebounded following two quarters of slight declines.

Earnings. Wages increased more moderately in January (6
per cent annual rate) after advancing sharply in December. Compared to
a year ago the private nonfarm earnings index was up by 5.9 per cent
and the index for manufacturing earnings by 5.7 per cent. Since August,
however, there has been an acceleration in the rate of increase, and for
the private nonfarm sector as a whole, earnings rose at a 7.3 per cent
annual rate. More rapid increases have been widespread, including
services and construction.

Collective bargaining. Wage increases in major nonfarm
collective bargaining settlements in 1972 averaged 6.4 per cent over
the life of the contract, with fourth quarter data indicating a further
slowing from the 8.1 per cent average increase of 1971. Collective
bargaining settlements in both manufacturing and nonmanufacturing
industries for the year as a whole were well below increases negotiated
a year earlier. The continued decline in wage settlements is in con-
trast to the recent accelerated increases in average hourly earnings
for the private nonfarm sector as a whole. The collective bargaining
data cover only firms employing 1,000 or more workers while the earnings
data represent firms of all sizes. A clustering of major settlements
late in 1972 and wage increases in smaller firms may thus have caused
the acceleration in the hourly earnings index.

I -21
The recent declines in settlement terms reflect in part
substantially smaller first year increases, reflecting less pressure
for large catch-up increases with the moderation of the rise in consumer
prices. Contracts settled in 1972 had a shorter average duration--
about three months less on average than previously negotiated in these
situations. This development, which was most evident in the construction
industry, reflected union pressure to limit the length of contracts
during the stabilization period. Wage and benefit increases in 1972
together averaged 7.3 per cent over-the-life of the contract, compared
to 8.8 per cent in 1971.

p -preliminary.
Major settlements in 1972 covered 2.1 million workers primarily
in the aerospace, railroad, construction, and maritime industries--
much less than the 4.5 million covered in 1971. In addition,
tentative settlements affecting 900,000 workers were reached in 1972
with final settlement pending action by the Cost of Living Council.

I -22
Bargaining in 1973 will be heavy again, especially in the
second and third quarters when key negotiations will take place in the
trucking, rubber, electrical equipment, railroad, construction, and
auto industries. Since the end of Phase II, dress workers in the
Ladies Garment Union have received an 8 per cent first year wage
increase with 6 per cent pay raises to follow in
years of the contract.
Consumer prices. The rise in consumer
December to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
prices leveled off temporarily. Other commodity
costs, however, increased more than in November,
per cent respectively. The advance in the total
and during Phase II, was 3.4 per cent.the second and third
prices slowed in
2.6 per cent as food
prices and service

index during 1972,
A seasonal decline in beef prices and a much less than
seasonal advance for fresh vegetables offset increases for other foods.
Egg prices rose sharply and increases were also substantial for dairy
and cereal and bakery products for the second month.
Preliminary Department of Agriculture estimates (confidential)
based on its chain store sample for early January (the time of month when
food also is priced for the CPI) indicate sharply higher retail prices
for beef and pork. Wholesale prices for beef, pork, cattle and hogs
climbed further through early February; with margins for pork (though
not for beef) squeezed for some time, sizable advances in meat prices at
retail are also likely for February. The USDA expects substantially
larger pork supplies, and consequently lower prices, in the second half
of the year.

The index for other commodities includes only part of the
increase on new cars approved by the Price Commission to cover costs
of Government-mandated equipment; most of this advance should be
reflected in January. Among service costs, property taxes rose
further--to a level over 9 per cent above December 1971--and increases
in rents and in home maintenance and repairs were the largest since
January 1972 and June 1971, respectively.

Sensitive commodity prices. A marked increase in prices of
materials and supplies in January has been reported by purchasing
agents. The sensitive BLS index of raw materials, reflecting some of
these changes, increased sharply from mid-December to the end of January.
Continuation of the upward trend in this index was the result in large
part of increases for metals, raw cotton and wool tops, rubber, and
cow hides.
Several metals recently have been subject to upward price
pressure. Domestic copper prices were increased in January mainly as
a result of increased prices on the London Metal Exchange (LME).
Continued price increases on the LME combined with increased demand
here could bring about another price rise soon. The price of zinc
was also raised since mid-December (under Phase III regulations) and
the market has been able to support the higher price. The market
price of lead also was increased as demand strengthened. Prices of
some aluminum products (not included in the BLS raw industrials index)
indicated some firming of demand which may presage some further
price increases. Prices of steel scrap remained at a high level as
strong demands, both foreign and domestic, persisted.
Recent increases in prices of raw cotton were caused in
large part by delays in harvesting, and higher prices for wool tops
reflected low world supplies and increased demand. Prices of hides
have shown renewed upward movement recently after having declined
somewhat at the end of last year because of temporarily reduced demand.
Foreign demand for U.S. hides, caused in large part by the embargo on
hide exports by Argentina, has been a major cause of the recent high
price level.

I -25
Increased prices of fuel oil and lumber and plywood--
commodities not in the BLS raw industrials index--have recently been
reported. Higher fuel oil prices were the result, in part, of extremely
cold weather, reduced supplies of fuel oil, and higher operating and
raw materials costs. The large increases reported for lumber and
plywood since the beginning of Phase III were associated with the easing
of economic controls, but the basic reasons for the higher prices were
tight supplies and strong foreign and domestic demands.
1972 Price changes in the CPI and the WPI. During the
twelve months of 1972, the CPI rose 3.4 per cent and the WPI about
twice as much, 6.5 per cent. Most of the difference can be attributed
to the exceptionally rapid increase of wholesale prices for farm
products, as well as for certain industrial materials, which do not
enter the CPI.
Farm product prices (excluding processed foods and feeds)
rose 19 per cent during the year, intermediate materials, about 4 per
cent, and crude materials, 11 per cent. In the case of roughly com-
parable categories of consumer finished goods, prices of nonfood
commodities rose little more than 2 per cent in both indexes but food
prices rose more in the WPI--8 per cent as compared to 5 per cent.
(Retail food prices usually fluctuate less than those at wholesale
because of the influence of other costs; in addition there was a squeeze
on margins in 1972, in part because of the competitive price policy of
a major supermarket chain).

I -26
The 3.6 per cent increase in service costs in the CPI, which
have no counterpart in the WPI exceeded the rise for consumer nonfood
commodities but was well below those for foods and materials.

Agriculture. Prices received by farmers increased another
5 per cent during the month ended January 15 to a level a fifth above
a year ago. Prices of livestock, poultry, eggs, and fresh vegetables
contributed to the rise. Prices of corn and cotton declined, the latter
due to larger marketings of lower grades. But, by early February, corn
prices had reversed their decline and hog and steer prices increased
significantly further. Soybean prices also advanced but eggs and wheat
had declined.
Limited red meat and poultry supplies--the smallest in three
years--contributed to the January livestock price increases. A decline
of 4 per cent in this year's winter vegetable production, caused by
unseasonably cold weather, affected January prices and should continue
to affect fresh vegetable prices through March.
Corn and soybean harvests were also hampered by weather
and were still 5 per cent incomplete on February 5; final estimates of
yields are 3 per cent smaller and 9 per cent larger, respectively,
than 1971 harvests. High prices and revisions in the feed grain and
wheat programs (particularly that announced on January 30) are ex-
pected to induce 1973 plantings of corn and soybeans about 10 per cent
larger than in 1972. Export demand is expected to keep prices high.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL SITUATION
Since the last Committee meeting short-term market interest
rates have risen by as much as 50 basis points. Four banks raised
their prime loan rate by 1/4 point, but after the CID press release
indicated that justification was being requested, three of their insti-
tutions rescinded their action and, as of this writing, no other bank
had raised its rate. Most recently, pressures on the bill market have
lessened as foreign central banks have moved to reinvest much of their
recent large dollar acquisitions in Treasury bills.
Financial institutions in January continued to experience
relatively rapid fund inflows. Despite the increase in yields on com-
peting assets, nonbank thrift institutions, for example, appear in
January to have attracted funds at a rate significantly above the average
of the final months of 1972. Similarly, commercial banks, even with pri-
vate demand balances showing no expansion and growth in passbook savings
accounts slowing, benefited from higher Treasury balances and continued
to attract a significant volume of time deposits. A substantial share
of the latter appear to reflect temporary State and local government
investment of both the December and January revenue sharing payments.
Despite the rise in short-term market yields, long rates
edged up by only 10 to 15 basis points during the intra-meeting period.
Modest corporate offerings in the public bond market and a continued
availability of funds to institutional investors have played a signifi-
cant role in the relative stability of longer-term rates. However,
commercial banks in January continued to reduce their net acquisitions

II -2
of securities, placing almost all of their new funds in loan markets.
Business loans rose extremely rapidly, and both real estate and consumer
loan expansion at banks was maintained at the very high rates of recent
months.
Outlook. Divergent market influences cloud the immediate out-
look for short-term interest rates. Reinvestment demand growing out of
the Treasury's refunding operation and foreign central bank purchases
are likely in the days just ahead to provide some buoyancy to bill
markets. Presumably, however, these funds came out of other dollar in-
vestments, including short-term instruments and possibly also the stock
market. Such instruments would be under upward rate pressure. In
addition, rates on some short-term market instruments have not kept pace
with the recent advance in the funds rate, and they may be subject to
additional upward pressure as they come into closer alignment.
Over the longer run, into spring, short-term credit demands
are expected to remain strong, placing further upward pressure on short-
term market rates. Treasury financing plans call for sizable new bill
issues for cash by mid-April, although any issuance of specials to
foreign accounts will reduce this need. Given the high level of economic
activity, business credit demands are also likely to be large. And the
possible diversion of business credit demands from the commercial paper
market may further strengthen total loan growth at banks. In an
environment in which growth of consumer-type interest bearing deposits
may be slowing, strong credit demands on banks would lead to further
reductions in the relatively high-level of bank liquidity and a more
aggressive stance of banks in the CD markets.

II -3
Even if money market rates only fluctuate in a narrow range,
their current level suggests that inflows of consumer-type interest
bearing deposits at banks and nonbank thrift institutions can be expected
to moderate. However, the degree of moderation is difficult to predict
because of the large expected refunds of Federal income taxes and the
increasing importance of term accounts in the liability structure of
these institutions, It does seem clear, however, that short-term
market rates are approaching the zone in which uncertainties regarding
deposit inflows could lead to some cutback in new mortgage commitments
of thrift institutions, especially given the large backlog of commit-
ments already outstanding.
With a relatively modest calendar of bond offerings and the
favorable cash flow position of many institutional investors, long-term
rates have adjusted only moderately upward thus far in response to the
recent shift in Federal Reserve policy. The staff continues to hear
reports, however, of sizable capital market financing planned for
March and April. In addition, several large investment bankers are
reported to be counseling borrowers to accelerate planned financing in
order to avoid higher interest costs later. Some upward rate pressures
could occur, therefore, if the corporate calendar for March and April
builds up to the extent that now appears possible. In any event,
long-term markets are likely to be unusually sensitive to any further
tightening in money market rates and conditions.

II -4
Monetary aggregates. Preliminary estimates indicate that
the money stock showed no further growth on average in January following
the exceedingly rapid advance in December. As a result, M1 expansion
for the two months combined was at an annual rate of around 6 1/2 per
cent, approximately one percentage point below that for the first 11
months of 1972, Part of the recent volatility in M1 growth appears to
have been associated with the buildup of demand balances of State and
local governments out of revenue sharing funds in December, and the
shift of these funds into interest earning assets, including CD's and
open account time deposits, in January. Taking the two months together,
however, the figures suggest a still strong underlying transactions
demand for money.
Along with the rising transactions demand, part of the strength in
M1 in recent weeks may reflect additions to compensating balances by busi-
nesses. The Demand Deposit Ownership Survey shows that in December almost 80
per cent of the sizable increase in gross IPC demand deposits at Weekly
Reporting Banks was in balances of nonfinancial corporate businesses.
This rise in business balances was considerably larger than the increase
in December of 1971 and also 1970. Similarly, for the fourth quarter
as a whole, businesses--which hold approximately 52 per cent of total
IPC balances--accounted for over 72 per cent of the large quarterly
increase in such deposits at all commercial banks; increases in consumer
holdings were largely responsible for the rest.
In January, slower growth of M1 was partially offset by stronger
inflows of time deposits other than negotiable CD's, and M2 expanded at
an annual rate close to 7 per cent. However, this was considerably below

the 10 per cent rate of growth that generally prevailed over 1972. Part
of the January strength in other time deposits reflected the increase in
State and local holdings noted above. On the other hand, inflows of
savings deposits, with their lower offering yields, began to slow as
interest yields on competing market securities continued to rise. There
were continuing strong deposit inflows at nonbank institutions--particu-
larly into higher yielding term accounts--so that M3 expanded at a 10.1
per cent rate during the month.
Growth in the adjusted bank credit proxy slowed in January
relative to December, but it still exceeded that for M2, as shown in
the table. Despite a narrowing spread between CD rates and other short-
term yields during January, sales of large CD's remained relatively
large, although less than the average monthly increases of the previous
quarter. To some extent, this strength also may have reflected the
inflow into the CD market of State and local revenue sharing funds,
U.S. government deposits also rose moderately in January, while non-
deposit sources of funds showed relatively little change.

Bank credit. Bank credit data for January--although still pre-
liminary and subject to revision--indicated that demands for credit were
exceptionally strong, with total loans expanding at an annual rate of
close to 25 per cent. While almost all loan categories showed substan-
tial growth, the most rapid increase occurred in business loans which
expanded at a record rate of approximately 35 per cent. Moreover, both
real estate and consumer loans continued to grow at the high rates of
other recent months.
Business loan growth, which had slowed during the first two
weeks of December, accelerated during the last part of December and
through most of January. The expansion was broadly based geographi-
cally and among industries, with almost all major industries increasing

II -8
their reliance on bank financing. At the larger banks, there has been
little evidence of a lengthening in the maturity structure of new loans,
suggesting that the rising corporate credit demands were primarily for
working capital purposes. Some of the increase may also have reflected
a shift to bank financing from the commercial paper market, as commercial
paper rates increased relative to the prime rate. In conjunction with
expanding credit demands and firmer money market conditions, four banks
announced increases in their prime rates from 6 to 6-1/4 per cent effec-
tive February 5, but following issuance of a press release by the
Committee on Interest and Dividends, indicating that justification was
being requested, no further increases have been announced and three of
the four banks rescinded their increases.
With no Treasury financings during the month and faced with
accelerated loan demand, banks reduced their holdings of U.S. government
securities during January. Although there were some net acquisitions
of other securities, holdings of these securities increased at a much
slower rate than in other recent months. As a result, both New York
City banks and banks outside New York experienced a decline in their
liquidity ratios--the ratio of liquid assets to total liabilities.
However, there is some seasonality associated with this decline, and
liquidity ratios in general remain high by historical standards.

Consumer credit. Total consumer credit outstanding rose at
a record seasonally adjusted annual rate of $29.6 billion in December,
substantially exceeding the month earlier high of $25,5 billion. The
large increases reported in each month of the fourth quarter boosted
the full year increase to $19.2 billion, or nearly 14 per cent. In
1971, the growth in consumer credit outstanding had amounted to $11.2
billion (8.8 per cent), while over the 5 preceding years annual gains
averaged $7.5 billion.

II -10
Noninstalment credit--bolstered by an unusually large increase
in charge account credit--expanded by a record amount in December, but
the increase in instalment debt outstanding was somewhat smaller than
in November, after seasonal adjustment. The rise in seasonally adjusted
extensions and repayments of instalment credit both slackened slightly
in December, but totals for the full year reached new highs.
The cumulative expansion in total consumer credit outstanding
during the 25 months since the general business recession low in November
1970 has totaled nearly $33 billion, or more than 26 per cent. This
exceeds the increases in comparable periods of recent business upswings
but trails the expansions in the earlier postwar cycles. Since late
1970, extensions of instalment credit have advanced more than two-fifths,
while repayments--which generally lag--have risen one-fifth.

Customer finance rates on consumer instalment credit contracts
purchased by finance companies during the fourth quarter showed a mixed
pattern. Rates for both new and used cars dipped slightly in October,
but edged up again during November and December. At year-end, the
weighted average rate for all units financed was unchanged from December
1971; a decline of 19 basis points in new car rates was balanced by a
rise of about 60 basis points in the less heavily weighted used car com-
ponent. Finance rates on contracts acquired by finance companies for
consumer purchases of mobile homes and other nonautomotive consumer
goods declined in the fourth quarter and were considerably below earlier
1972 levels.
Nonbank thrift institutions. Despite recent rises in short-
term market rates, savings flows to nonbank thrift institutions were
exceptionally strong during January. The estimated combined annual
growth rate for the month is 17 per cent, substantially higher than that
recorded during the last few months of 1972.

Savings and loan associations have used some of their increased
inflows to repay FHLB advances, particularly in the Atlanta district
where end-of-year borrowing was heavy. Although no commitment data are
available for January, both new and outstanding commitments at S&L's
remained quite high in December.
Short-term markets. Money market conditions have firmed
significantly since the last FOMC meeting, as reflected by a 50 basis
point rise in the federal funds rate. In response, rates in the private
sector of the short term market have risen about 3/8 of a percentage point
on bank CD's and finance company paper and 1/2 percentage point on 90
to 119 day commercial paper. Treasury bill rates also have been subject
to substantial upward pressures over this period, essentially keeping
pace with the upward movement in the funds rate over most of the period.
In recent days, however, bill rates have declined to some extent and are
presently about 30 basis points (in the 6-month maturity area) to 40
basis points (in the 3-month maturity area) above their levels at the
time of the last meeting. The recent downtrend in rates appears to
reflect actual and potential foreign central bank buying as a result of
the dollar outflow and expectations of some reinvestment demand from
attrition in the current Treasury refunding. Dealer bill positions,
which had been relatively high in December and through most of January,
recently dropped back to more normal levels, so that a significant
proportion of the expected increase in bill demands may have to be met
by suppliers outside professional circles.
The Treasury has entered the mid-February financing period
with a cash balance significantly higher than had been expected at the

II -13
time of the last Greenbook, as receipts have been running higher and
expenditures lower than was anticipated in early January. Consequently,
the Treasury will be able to handle a fairly large attrition in its
current financing quite comfortably and will not have to return to the
market for new money until late February or early March. Assuming that
the Treasury doesn't sell special issues to foreign central banks over
this period, they will probably need to raise about $3.5 billion of new
money at that time. The Treasury probably will return to the market in
early April to raise about $4.0 billion. According to Under Secretary
of the Treasury Volcker, this borrowing probably will be focused in
the short term area of the market and could include April and June TABS,
another quarterly 2-year note of $2 billion, and a $1.8 billion issue
which will fill the 13th slot of the 52-week bill cycle.

Treasury Coupon Issues
Yields on Treasury coupon issues also have been subject to
upward pressure since the last Committee meeting, particularly those
with intermediate term maturities. To a considerable extent these
advances represent adjustments to the general uptrend in short-term
interest rates. In addition, they reflect market adjustment to the

II -15
terms of the Treasury's mid-February refinancing. In this operation,
holders of maturing issues--of which $4.8 billion are publicly held--
have been offered an exchange into a new 3-1/2 year, 6-1/2 per cent note
priced at a discount to yield 6.60 per cent. The Treasury is also
auctioning $1 billion of a 6-3/4 year note with a 6-5/8 per cent
coupon for cash, Subscriptions for both issues close February 7 with
settlement on February 15.
The market's response to the 3-1/2 year note initially was
favorable but a more cautious attitude subsequently developed and
the security has most recently traded on a when-issued basis at just
its issue price. Thus, there may be substantial attrition in this
exchange, which will only be partly offset by the cash raised in the
auction of the longer term note. Early ideas on the average yield
likely to be set in the auction for the longer note center around
6.70 per cent.

II -16
Other long-term security markets. Since the beginning of
January long-term interest rates have moved up 7 to 12 basis points,
in contrast to the decline that often occurs during this period.
The sharp rise in short-term rates and uncertainty about future
inflationary trends and the strength of the dollar in world markets
seem to have made both underwriters and investors uneasy.

The volume of public corporate bond floatations was only $1
billion during January. Utility offerings were unusually light, and

II -17
there were just a few industrial and financial firms in the market.
Underwriters report a buildup of prospective borrowers for late in
the spring, and some of these might accelerate their offerings should
expectations of sharp rises in long-term rates develop. However, based
on present schedulings the staff estimates that February volume will
be about $900 million. Commitment data suggest that takedowns of
private placements will continue to remain around the $700 million
level, and there is also little prospect of a significant change in
new equity issue volume.

State and local government long-term bond offerings amounted
to $2.0 billion in January. (This total includes a $220 million issue

II -18
of taxable municipal bonds sold by Metro.) The staff still expects
February volume to be somewhat lower. Many State and local govern-
ments are finding themselves in a comfortable surplus position
because of rising tax revenues and Federal revenue-sharing grants,
and sales of general obligation bonds have been moderating.
In equity markets, prices have declined considerably
since the announcement of Phase III and the increase in the discount
rate. With investors concerned about prospective inflation and
credit developments, the price decline in NYSE stocks has erased more
than one-third of the gains registered in the major rally that began
in mid-October and continued on balance during the late-December early-
January period despite the temporary dimming of peace prospects in
Vietnam. Most recently, the weakening of the dollar in international
markets has constituted an additional stock market uncertainty, while
the final signing of the Vietnam peace agreement had no discernible
favorable market impact. The volume of trading activity has moderated
over the past several weeks, but remains high.
The latest evidence suggests that individual investors have
continued to find equity investments unattractive. Individual cash
account customers have been net sellers of stock through most of 1972
and into 1973, judging from various sources of data. In addition,
mutual funds experienced another sizable volume of net share redemp-
tions in December--the 11th consecutive month in which redemptions
exceeded sales. Margin investors, principally individuals, increased
their net debt by only a small amount in December, following limited
increases in the preceding three months.

Mortgage market. Interest rates on home mortgages
apparently remained relatively stable during January. Field reports
and other evidence suggest that contract interest rates in the primary
market continued around levels that have prevailed since August. In
the secondary market, the average yield on Government underwritten
mortgages in the latest FNMA bi-weekly auction (February 5) was up
only slightly to 7.69 per cent. The volume of bids remained compara-
tively low, reflecting both strong private investor demand for mort-
gages of all types as well as a further decline in HUD(FHA) insurance
activity due to field office delays associated with tightening of
regulatory standards and increased competition from high-ratio conven-
tional mortgages.
On conventional home mortgages in general, average non-rate
terms remained relatively liberal through December, according to the
FHLBB series. Implied downpayments--an important aspect of effective
demand for single-family houses--declined somewhat during 1972, as
1/ Potential support for high-ratio conventional mortgages in the
secondary market was strengthened somewhat by liberalized FNMA regu-
lations, effective January 29, relating to its commitment pricing
policies on these loans.

Federal finance. The new Federal budget for fiscal year 1974
calls for a deficit of $12.7 billion on a unified budget basis and a
high employment surplus of $.3 billion. For the current fiscal year,
the Administration is predicting a unified budget deficit of $24.8
nillion and a high employment deficit of $2.3 billion. Outlays in
fiscal 1974 are set at $268.7 billion, an increase of $18.9 billion
over the estimated $249.8 billion for 1973. These aspects of the

II -22
budget are shown in table 3 at the end of this section. The budget
indicates that outlays in these years would be much larger if the
Administration had not sought savings through program reductions and
terminations.
A shift to tighter controls over program growth in fiscal
1974 is indicated in Table 1 even after adjustments in outlays are
made for financial asset sales, oil lease sales and other proprietary
receipts. These items are recorded as negative entries in the tab-
ulation of total outlays. Like NIA expenditures, the increase in
adjusted budget outlays for fiscal 1974 drops sharply from that in
fiscal 1973.

The staff's current estimate of outlays for fiscal 1973 is
consistent with the Administration's projected $250 billion ceiling
since spending so far this fiscal year appears to be in line with such
a spending total. According to the new budget the $250 billion goal
will require a spending cutback of $11.2 billion. As shown in Table
2, the spending reduction is to be achieved by timing shifts and
additional negative outlays as well as a large number of mostly small
program reductions and terminations.

The new budget projects receipts of $225 billion for fiscal
1973 and $256 billion for fiscal 1974, which represent increases of
7.9 per cent and 13.8 per cent, respectively. The increase in fiscal
1974 is largely attributable to the January 1973 rise in the social
security wage base and tax rates.
Since the January Greenbook, the staff has raised its fiscal
1973 receipts estimate from $226.5 billion to $228 billion--$3.0 billion
above the budget. This is the result of a staff reestimate of the
extra refunds (net of final payments) resulting from 1972 overwithholding
which are now expected to inject an additional $7 billion into house-
hold funds during the spring, rather than the $8 billion we had expected
earlier. In general, we are assuming slightly higher effective tax rates
than those which underlie the Budget estimates--especially in regard to
corporate taxes--and our forecasts are based on slightly higher income
assumptions.
The budget document contains no legislative proposals that
would require major additional outlays in fiscal 1974 and no major tax
proposals. Also, it provides no funds for reconstruction efforts in
Southeast Asia, property tax relief, or family welfare reform. Adminis-
tration spokesmen have indicated that if these programs are introduced,
other budget items would be cut to stay within spending ceilings. The
main legislative proposals involve economies such as a somewhat larger
sharing of costs by medicare patients, and the lumping of a number of
categorical grants into special revenue sharing programs in the areas
of education and law enforcement. In the latter case the costs of
these new programs would approximately equal those of the narrower cate-
gorical grants they would replace.

II -25
Looking at fiscal year 1974 expenditures on an NIA basis,
defense spending rises slightly by $1.3 billion while non-defense pur-
chases show a sharp increase of $4.5 billion, reflecting in part a
cessation of reductions in CCC inventories. Transfer payments rise by
$10 billion, somewhat less than in fiscal year 1973. The sharpest
change of emphasis is in the grants area. Grants have been steadily
increasing during the last decade, and the increase is unusually large
in fiscal 1973 when revenue sharing was introduced. In fiscal 1974,
grants stay unchanged at $41.6 billion, However, Federal takeover of
welfare for the aged, blind, and disabled in January 1974 relieves the
States of $1.1 billion of public assistance payments that are currently
financed from grants.
The budget for fiscal 1974 shows a slower rate of growth (6.0
per cent) for total NIA expenditures than for unified budget outlays (7.6
per cent), reflecting a tapering off in asset sales and a cessation of
the economies in unified budget outlays for fiscal 1973 that resulted
from the outlay speed-up at the end of fiscal 1972. The Staff's esti-
mates of Federal Sector NIA accounts are in general agreement with
those presented in the budget.
As shown in table 3, the staff projections indicate that
almost all of the expenditure growth in calendar 1973 will occur in
the first half of the year when NIA spending will rise by about $14.8
billion. In the second half, expenditures are projected to rise by
only $1.6 billion. The high employment budget shows a similar decrease
in fiscal stimulus as the calendar year progresses.

II -26
The budget document projects that net borrowing from the
public will be $25 billion in fiscal year 1973. The staff's current
estimate is for a lower amount--$20 billion. The difference is due to
the fact that our receipts estimate is $3.0 billion higher than that
given in the budget, and we are projecting a $1.2 billion net drain from
other financial sources compared to one of $3.2 predicted by the
Administration.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
Summary and outlook. The relative calm in foreign exchange
markets that had prevailed after the end of the speculative disturbances
of last June and July was shattered again in January, and the dollar came
under heavy speculative pressure. The first action that stirred the market
was the decision of the Italian authorities to protect the lira against
large capital outflows by creating a dual market for that currency.
Uneasiness was then heightened by the floating of the Swiss franc as
the Swiss authorities chose this method of discouraging inflows of
capital that were adding to excess liquidity in Switzerland.
After a few days' lull, there was a greatly heightened burst of
speculative activity in the closing days of January and early February,
this time representing mainly a rush to some other currencies, especially
the deutschemark, out of dollars. At this point, the market's behavior
seemed to reflect deep-seated concerns with the continuing heavy U.S.
deficits, especially as reflected in the December trade data, which
disappointed hopes that a strong trend of improvement was finally under
way. Moreover, the fourth-quarter trade performances of Germany and
Japan were so strong as to suggest to market participants that these
countries would have a stronger balance-of-payments position this year
than in 1972, despite their revaluations.
In the final quarter of 1972 the U.S. deficit on the official
settlements basis was $1.6 billion, seasonally adjusted, bringing the
total for the year to $10.8 billion (apart from SDR allocations).

III -2
On the (gross) liquidity basis the fourth-quarter and annual deficits
were $4.0 billion and $15.5 billion, respectively. Factors tending to
raise the deficit in December were the continued large excess of imports
over exports (although there will be a small upward revision of exports
from the figure initially published), a net increase in bank-reported
claims on foreigners of over $1.0 billion, and a somewhat diminished
inflow to purchase U.S. corporate stocks. Also, year-end repatriations
by direct investors may have been somewhat less than normal.
For the four weeks ended January 31, 1973, weekly data indicate
a surplus (not seasonally adjusted) of perhaps $0.5 billion on the
official settlements basis. That figure would not yet include the large
capital outflows resulting from exchange market transactions on the
last two days of January. Very little is known about transactions during
the month except for inflows of liquid funds through banks mainly in the
first half of the month. There may also have been some reflow of bank
credit, for the month as a whole, though outflows were reported in the last
week. Inflows of foreign capital to the U.S. stock market probably tapered of
The prospects for the U.S. balance of payments in the period
ahead are not encouraging. While the outlook for exports is good, improve-
ment in the trade balance will be slowed by the growing demand in sectors
of the U.S. economy that tend to draw heavily on imports. Large increases
in interest payments to foreigners will more than offset any likely gain
in income receipts. Against that background, recurrent speculative outflows
may continue.

Recent Developments in Foreign Exchange Markets. After trading
fairly quietly on foreign exchange markets through most of January, the
dollar came under heavy selling pressure in recent weeks, culminating
in purchases by foreign central banks totaling nearly $4 billion in the
past week.
Pressure on the dollar was triggered by the institution in
Italy of a two-tier exchange market on January 22, allowing the value
of the lira in capital transactions to float while its value in most
current transactions is maintained within the official bands. The move
was taken to defend Italy's foreign exchange reserves against the heavy
capital outflows which had been taking place since mid-1972.
The introduction of a dual market for the lira was immediately
followed by a weakening of the dollar against all European currencies.
The partial floating of the lira exerted particularly strong upward
pressure on the Swiss franc. This was due in part directly to Italian
demand for francs but also reflected the general appeal of the Swiss
franc to nervous dollar holders. Moreover, interest rates had climbed
sharply in Switzerland because of stabilization measures introduced
by the Swiss in recent months and these measures in themselves enhanced
confidence in the Swiss franc.
The Swiss National Bank purchased nearly $300 million the day
the dual lira market was introduced. The following day, in order to
counter the threat to its anti-inflation program posed by large-scale
capital inflows, the Bank announced that it would temporarily cease
intervening to keep the Swiss franc from exceeding its upper limit.

III -4
The exchange rate of the franc immediately rose above its ceiling and
has continued to float upward to a current level almost 5 per cent above
its upper limit -- a level which would seem to effectively rule out a
return to the pre-float central rate.
To the general feeling of uncertainty over the stability
of the Smithsonian exchange rate structure engendered by the Italian
and Swiss actions was added a feeling of pessimism over the fundamental
strength of the dollar following the release on Wednesday, January 24 of
U.S. trade figures for December showing a worsening of the already large
November deficit and a deficit for 1972 as a whole of nearly $6.5 billion
(census basis). Under these conditions major European currencies moved
towards their ceilings led by the German mark, the only major European
currency -- along with the Dutch guilder -- not either floating or
traded under a dual market system. This movement was only temporarily
halted by favorable market reaction to press reports on Thursday January 25
of market intervention by the FRBNY. (The System's sales in the New York
market of German marks and, to the lesser extent, Dutch guilders, have
continued on nearly a daily basis up to the present).
By last Thursday, February 1 all major non-floating currencies
except the lira had reached or exceeded their ceilings, and on Thursday
and Friday foreign central banks took in nearly $1.7 billion. The
Bundesbank bought by far the largest amount ($1 billion), but the Bank
of Japan ($250 million) and the National Bank of Belgium ($200 million)
also intervened substantially. The Bank of Japan purchased an additional
$275 million on Saturday following a statement of the Governor of the

III -5
Bank that he could not preclude the possibility of another yen reval-
uation.
On Friday evening the German Cabinet reaffirmed its intention
to defend the current mark parity and announced additional capital control
measures to deal with the speculative rush into marks. These included
the requirement that German non-bank residents must obtain prior Bundesbank
approval for foreign borrowing in excess of 50 thousand markes and the
extension of the de facto ban applied in June to sales by Germans of
German bonds to non-residents to include sales to foreigners of German
equities.
The German government's actions halted the rush out of the
dollar on Monday, February 5, but amidst a growing feeling that the
German measures did not come to grips with the fundamental problem,
heavy selling of the dollar on the German exchanges resumed on Tuesday.
The Bundesbank purchased over $1.5 billion with other European central
banks also taking in smaller amounts of dollars. A further reaffirmation
by the German Finance Cabinet at mid-day of its intention to continue to
defend the mark's upper limit with Bundesbank intervention halted the
inflow, but the mark, Belgian franc, and Dutch guilder all remain
poised nervously just below their ceilings.
Sterling, which had traded quietly around $2.35 through most
of January was pulled up by the currency turmoil on the Continent, rising
above $2.39 on February 6 before easing to a current level of $2.38.
The Bank of England purchased nearly $200 million as the pound moved
up. The gold price was similarly stimulated by the recent exchange

market unrest, rising to nearly $69 after trading around $64.50 through
most of January.
Euro-dollar market. Over the past four weeks interest rates
in the Euro-dollar market have risen sharply further in some maturities.
In recent days the 1-month and 3-month Euro-dollar rates have been higher
by 1 to 1-1/4 percentage points than in the week of January 10. The
mounting speculation against the dollar evident in the exchange markets
since January 22 has undoubtedly taken the form as well of increased
demand for Euro-dollar loans for switching into other currencies on a
speculative basis, along with a reduced supply of Euro-dollar deposits.
Most of the past month's rise in Euro-dollar rates in fact occurred after
the speculation against the dollar broke out. Rising short-term interest
rates in the United States have been another factor putting upward
pressure on Euro-dollar rates. Abroad, there has not been significant
additional tightening of Continental European money markets, but British
interest rates have continued to climb. In early February the 3-month
local authority rate in Britain was up about a percentage point from
a month earlier.
Movements of differentials between Euro-dollar rates and U.S.
interest rates have been mixed. With Euro-dollar rates in the 1-month
and 3-month maturities increasing faster than comparable domestic CD
rates, there has been a widening of rate differentials that .already
favored investments in Euro-dollars and discouraged U.S. banks from
borrowing Euro-dollars in those maturities (even if reserve-free).
In contrast, the U.S. Federal funds rate has risen considerably relative

The exchange markets and balance of payments trends in selected
countries. The recent unsettled conditions in the foreign exchange
markets raise the question whether the recent upward pressure on most
major European currencies and the Japanese yen, and the continuing weak-
ness of the Italian lira, seem justified by underlying balance of
payments trends.
On the face of it, the prime cause of the downward movement of
the dollar against all other major currencies described above appears to
have been the mounting loss of confidence in the dollar itself. For the
most part, recent balance of payments developments do not appear to indi-
cate pronounced general disequilibria, except vis-á-vis the United States.
In Germany, for example, even though the mark has been the currency most
heavily in demand since the exchange crisis began two and a half weeks
ago, the prospect is for approximate balance of payments equilibrium in
1973.
A notable exception, in addition to the United States, to the
apparent absence of major imbalances in individual countries is Japan,
which clearly remains in persistent surplus.
Despite the revaluation of the yen in 1971 and the subsequent
adoption of direct measures aimed at reducing the trade surplus, the
Japanese current account surplus this year is expected to decline by
only a relatively small amount, to something over $5 billion from $6.7
billion last year. A decline in the trade surplus of about $1 billion--
from $9 billion to about $8 billion--is anticipated, with the dollar

III -9
value of exports increasing by about 11 per cent, imports by about 22
per cent. And most of this move towards a diminution of the Japanese
surplus can be explained by the recovery in economic activity from the
1970-71 recession. The measures taken to reduce the trade surplus--a
20 per cent cut in tariffs, a 30 per cent rise in import quotas, and
controls to restrain the growth of exports--are expected to contribute
relatively little to a more balanced trade position in 1973.
The basic balance surplus will be somewhat smaller than the
current account surplus but, adjusted for reserve gains disguised as
capital outflows, will probably total a very substantial $3.5 billion.
The recent surge in demand for marks almost certainly owes
something to a changed balance of payments outlook. A huge and unexpected
trade surplus in the fourth quarter, primarily reflecting a sharp increase
in exports, put the German current account (seasonally adjusted) in the
black after a third quarter deficit and virtually a zero balance in the
second. An extremely steep jump in export orders in the second half of
1972, moreover, points to the achievement of a very large trade surplus
next year.
However, though a large deficit is no longer anticipated in
1973, as it was until fairly recently, the current account is likely to
show only a small surplus at most. The deficit on service transactions
and transfers shows a strongly rising trend, primarily because of a
continuing rise in travel expenditures and a sizable increase in

III -10
remittances by foreign workers, whose wages and numbers are increasing
as the economic upturn gathers steam.
In brief, the German balance of payments may be more or less
in equilibrium this year, provided no large capital inflow--other than
the purely speculative rush into marks in the last two and a half weeks--
occurs. The prospect of equilibrium suggests that the mark, looked at
in isolation from other currencies, is not basically undervalued at
present. This may help explain the evident determination of the German
authorities to maintain the present DM parity and their emphatic
rejection of revaluation or floating, at least for the time being,
in the absence of similar moves by major competitors, in particular
Japan.
The rise in the pound--which was floated in June--during the
present foreign exchange crisis has clearly not been a reflection of
underlying balance of payments strength. Even the most optimistic
current account forecast--made on the assumption of a $2.35 rate which
the current value of sterling now exceeds--foresees a 1973 deficit of
no less than $750 million.
The strong demand for guilders and Belgian francs is easier
to explain in that both the Netherlands and Belgium are expected to run
sizable surpluses, at least on current account, this year. However, the
anticipated strength of the current accounts in these countries in 1973
is based in part on cyclical factors, with the economies of both the
Netherlands and Belgium still operating at levels well below capacity.

III -11
For the Netherlands, the long-term outlook for the balance of payments
does not appear at all promising because of the exceptionally rapid rate
of domestic inflation.
As for Switzerland, there is no evidence that the rise of the
Swiss franc above its ceiling following the float initiated on January 23
can be attributed to factors other than those described above--that is,
the introduction of the dual market for lire in Italy, the favorable im-
pact on the market's view of the Swiss franc of the vigorous stabilization
measures recently adopted in Switzerland, and the weakness of the dollar.
The one major currency, other than the dollar, to exhibit
weakness during the recent exchange market disturbances was the Italian
lira. The value of the commercial lira vis-á-vis the dollar rose but
only because of intervention by EEC central banks to maintain the lira
exchange rate within the narrow EEC bands. The weakness of the commercial
lira is somewhat surprising, since the current account, on a transactions
basis, appears to have recorded a sizable surplus last year and since it
appears that even under high employment conditions--not achievable in the
near future in any event--the current account might well remain in surplus.
The softness of the commercial lira in the wake of the separation of
capital from current transactions in the exchange market implies that
this action did not dispel fears of a lira devaluation. Such fears are
primarily a function of political uncertainties in Italy.

III -12
Balance of payments. According to data that are now nearly
complete, the seasonally adjusted deficit on the official settlements
basis in the fourth quarter of 1972 was $1.6 billion -- about the same
as estimated earlier -- while the fourth-quarter deficit on the liquidity
basis was about $4.0 billion, considerably larger than indicated by the
weekly preliminary data. For the year 1972, the official settlements
deficit was $10.8 billion; the (gross) liquidity deficit was $15.4 billion.
Comparable figures for 1971 were $30.5 billion and $23.8 billion,
respectively.
Preliminary weekly data (not seasonally adjusted) for January
show a shift into a surplus of about $1/2 billion on the official
settlements basis and a small deficit on the liquidity basis. However,
there may again be a larger than usual discrepancy between the weekly
data and the final monthly figures, as there was in December. The
speculative flow into Swiss france in January is reflected in the weekly
data for the month, but the much larger outflows into DM and other
currencies at the end of the month will not show up until settlements
are made in the first week of February.
Apart from data on merchandise trade (discussed below)
information on other fourth-quarter 1972 developments is limited to
securities transactions and bank lending to foreigners. Foreign
purchases of U.S. equities in October-December quarter were particularly
large, totaling over $1 billion. Market reports indicate, however, that

III -13
there was a decided weakening in foreign purchases in January. Sales
of offshore bond issues by U.S. corporations (to finance their direct
investments abroad) were still relatively strong in the fourth quarter.
Partly offsetting these larger sales of U.S. securities was the
resumption of a more normal outflow for U.S. purchases of Canadian
and other IET exempt foreign new issues (about $375 million for the
quarter compared with a very small amount in the third quarter).
Bank claims on foreigners rose more than seasonally in
December; unadjusted the outflow was about $1-1/4 billion. About
half of the increase in bank claims was reported by U.S. agencies and
branches of foreign banks. Of the increase in claims reported by other
banks, the largest part was in assets not covered by the VFCR. Very
preliminary weekly data for January indicate a reverse flow, reducing U.S.
bank claims on foreigners, in the first three weeks of the month;
toward the end of the month there was another large increase in claims,
perhaps reflecting speculative borrowing of dollars by foreigners to sell
for other currencies.
U.S. foreign trade. Revised data for December show that the
trade deficit was slightly less in that month than in November. The
deficits in both November and December were markedly larger than in the
immediately preceding months and reversed the gradual decline in the
deficits that has occurred from June through October. For the fourth
quarter of 1972, the trade deficit was at an annual rate of $6-1/2 billion,

III -14
up slightly from the third quarter. For the year 1972 the trade deficit
was $6.8 billion, $4 billion more than in 1971.
The renewed expansion in imports after mid-year, as domestic
economic activity advanced strongly, was mainly responsible for the lack
of further improvement in the trade balance. Imports in the fourth
quarter were over 7 percent higher than in the third quarter, a decided
acceleration from the 4 percent advance from the second to the third
quarter. Higher import prices (unit values) accounted for less than
one-third of the increase in value of imports in the fourth quarter.
Virtually all categories of imports rose from the third to the fourth
quarter. Imports of industrial materials -- petroleum, steel and other
metals, lumber -- continued to advance strongly, as they have through-
out 1972. In addition imports of finished products -- mainly capital
equipment but also consumer goods (other than automobiles) -- which had
been unchanged from the second to the third quarter, turned up in the
last quarter of the year. Imports of such goods were a larger share of
total domestic expenditures for similar goods in the fourth quarter
than in the third, reflecting the influence of cyclical demand on imports.
Although imports of automobiles from Europe and Japan in the fourth
quarter did not rise, sales of these cars in the United States increased,
not only in terms of units but also as a share of total domestic car
sales, reversing the shrinkage in their share that occurred during most
of 1972. The increased demand for these foreign cars in the closing
months of the year was met by drawing down inventories built up earlier.

III -15
Exports advanced strongly in the fourth quarter -- reaching
a level 8 percent higher than in the third quarter -- with about two-
fifths of the increase in value accounted for by higher prices (unit-
values). The expansion in exports from the second to the third quarter
had been nearly as great -- 7-1/2 percent -- with virtually all of the
increase in real terms as prices rose only marginally. The current
strength in exports -- increases of over 30 percent at annual rates in
both the third and fourth quarters -- is particularly impressive since
exports in the year 1972 as a whole were only 15 percent greater than in
1971. Increased deliveries of agricultural commodities -- not only
to the Soviet Union but to other markets -- accounted for about two-fifths
of the rise in exports in the fourth quarter. The value of such
shipments continued to be buoyed by higher prices for wheat, corn, rice
and soybeans. Shipments of these commodities appear to be limited
only by the ability of transportation facilities, here and abroad,
to handle the heavy volume of cargo. In the current quarter, heavy
sales of cotton to Communist China are also expected to help maintain
agricultural exports at or above the $11 billion rate of the fourth
quarter. (In 1971 total agricultural exports had been less than
$8 billion.)
Exports of nonagricultural commodities also showed increasing
strength in the fourth quarter. Machinery exports rose further, and

III -16
foreign orders for U.S. machinery in December were extremely large,
continuing the rise in such orders that had begun around mid-1972.
Exports of nonagricultural industrial materials -- paper products,
chemicals, steel scrap and other metals -- were all up sharply in the
fourth quarter. Deliveries of commercial aircraft were also moderately
larger than in the third quarter; delivery schedules call for a greater
expansion in aircraft exports in 1973.
