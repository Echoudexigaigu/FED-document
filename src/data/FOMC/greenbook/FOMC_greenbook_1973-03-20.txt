Prefatory Note  
 
 
The attached document represents the most  complete and accurate version available 
based on original copies culled from the f iles of the FOMC Secretariat at the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve Syst em.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization proce ss which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain. 
 Please note that some material may have b een redacted from this document if that

1  In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic 
format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to rem ove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing). 
 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optical character recognition computer program (OCR) 
first created electronic text from the document im age.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, 
staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.  Pl ease note that the numbers and text in charts and 
tables were not reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff.

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
The staff continues to project an increase in real GNP this
quarter at an annual rate of 6-1/2 per cent, following an 8.0 per cent
rise in the fourth quarter. We have raised our projection of nominal
GNP, however, because prices have been rising even faster than we had
previously expected. The private GNP fixed weight price index is now
expected to rise at around a 5 per cent annual rate this quarter, up
from the 4.3 per cent rate we anticipated 5 weeks ago.
Industrial production in February increased 0.8 per cent,
following the 0.6 per cent rise now indicated for January (for release
Friday p.m.). Consumer goods, business equipment, and defense equipment
all contributed to the February rise. The labor market continues strong.
Nonfarm payroll employment rose sharply in February, following a moderate
January advance; for both months together, the increase was at an
annual rate of almost 3.5 million persons. Moreover, the manufacturing
workweek rebounded from its reduced January level.
Consumer demands have remained expansive. Retail sales in
December and January have been revised up and, even though the advance
estimate for February indicates a 1 per cent decline, February sales
are almost 3 per cent above the fourth quarter monthly average. Unit
auto sales in February, at an annual rate of 12 million (10 million
domestic-type) remained close to the record January total.
Business demands also have continued strong. New orders for
nondefense capital goods in January increased markedly further. The
latest Commerce survey of plant and equipment spending plans indicates

I-2
a rise of 14 per cent this year, compared to 13 per cent reported in
the preceding survey. And the Conference Board survey of capital
appropriations in manufacturing was up considerably further in the
fourth quarter. Book value of business inventories rose sharply in
January, mainly in trade, but the inventory-sales ratio declined
further to an exceptionally low level.
The rise in wage rates has slowed thus far this year, with
the hourly earnings index in February up 5.6 per cent from a year earlier.
But prices of farm products and foods rose sharply in February for the
third consecutive month. Moreover, seasonally adjusted prices for
industrial commodities, which had changed little in January, rose 1
per cent, with price increases widespread. Altogether, the wholesale
price index increased 1.6 per cent from January to February. In Jan-
uary consumer prices had risen 0.5 per cent as food prices spurted
upward.
Outlook. Our projection of nominal GNP for 1973 has been
raised in reflection of the faster rise in prices which now appears
in prospect. The pattern of change in real GNP, however, is virtually
the same as in the projection of five weeks ago. Revisions in most of
the major components are rather small, and are generally offsetting in
real terms. Growth is projected to be most rapid in the current quarter
and to slow thereafter, to about a 4 per cent rate in the fourth quarter.
The unemployment rate is still expected to decline to 4.7 per cent in
the fourth quarter.

With respect to underlying assumptions, growth in
aggregates is now projected to be consistent with expansion
around a 5-6 per cent annual rate, and some further rise inthe monetary
in M1 at
short-term
market rates is expected. The staff has retained the fiscal assumptions
of the preceding projection.
The latest readjustments in exchange rates, still in process,
have required us to make some tentative modifications in our projections
of net exports. The dollar value of imports is expected to increase
sharply in the second quarter, as the higher prices resulting from
devaluation of the dollar are more fully reflected in the trade figures.
Thereafter, exports are projected to rise more rapidly than imports,
reflecting the improved U.S. competitive position. By the fourth
quarter, net exports of goods and services are projected to be in balance;
our preceding projection had indicated a deficit of about $2 billion.II
4.0 3.9

I-4
As noted, we have raised our projections of price increases
expected for 1973. The early 1973 bulge in prices reflects a sharp
rise in foods as well as larger increases than we had anticipated in
other prices in the early stages of Phase III. Prices are projected
to rise less rapidly in the second quarter as the advance in food
prices slows somewhat. In the second half of the year, food prices
are expected to tend to level off as an enlarged volume of meat and
other supplies is marketed. However, the recent less favorable
experience with nonfood prices and a tentative evaluation of the effects
of devaluation on domestic prices suggest a somewhat more rapid rise
for the second half than we had projected formerly.

Industrial production. Industrial production increased 0.8
per cent further in February following a rise of 0.6 per cent in
January. At 120.8 per cent in February (1967=100), the index was
almost 10 per cent above a year earlier. Output gains last month were
mainly in consumer goods and business equipment. (For release Friday,
p.m.)
Auto assemblies rose 4 per cent to an annual rate of 10.1
million units, and March production schedules indicate little change
from the February level. Output of furniture and most other home goods
rose further and production of household appliances continued at record
levels. Output of nondurable consumer goods increased further. Gains
in production of business equipment were widespread. Output of defense
equipment also advanced and was 10 per cent above the low reached in
January 1972. Production of industrial materials rose only marginally
as an increase of 0.5 per cent in nondurable goods materials was partially
offset by a decline in steel production from already exceptionally high
rates. Capacity limitation in some materials producing industries has
slowed the annual rate of growth in output in the materials group to
about 2.5 per cent since December 1972, following a rise of 6 per cent
from December 1971 to December 1972. (Confidential until release
Friday, March 16.)

Retail sales. Retail sales declined 1 per cent in February,
following strong gains in December and January. Excluding the automo-
tive group and nonconsumer items, however, sales in February were un-
changed from the record January level. On the GAF grouping, higher
sales of general merchandise and apparel stores more than offset a
slight decline in furniture and appliance sales. Total February sales
were up about 13-1/2 per cent from a year earlier. In real terms, the
year-over-year increase amounted to about 9 per cent.

Unit sales of consumer durables. Sales of new domestic-type
autos in February were at a 9.9 million unit rate, a record for any
February and only a little below record January sales. Auto stocks
continued low, amounting to only a 48 day supply at the end of February,
15 per cent less than a year earlier.
February sales of foreign cars were at an annual rate of
2.1 million units, up 11 per cent from January. Total new car sales
in February were at a 12.0 million unit rate with imports accounting for
an 18 per cent share, compared to 16 per cent both a month and a year
earlier.
Factory unit sales of major home appliances declined an
estimated 8 per cent from the advanced January level, based on data
through the first 3 weeks of February. Of the nine items in the
index, only washers, driers, and refrigerators showed increases.

Construction and real estate. Seasonally adjusted value of
new construction put in place, which was revised upward significantly
in December and January, increased further to a new record annual
rate of almost $136 billion in February. Within the private sector,
both residential and nonresidential outlays reached new highs. Con-
tributing to the further expansion this winter was a surge in expendi-
tures for industrial plant construction; these had been particularly
low for more than a year. Outlays for public construction--revised
upward appreciably for recent months--dipped somewhat in February.
The Census Bureau's construction cost index, which had
increased further in January, apparently changed little in February to
continue at a level 6 per cent above a year earlier. This compared
with a 5 per cent year-to-year rise during 1972 and with increases of
7 per cent in both 1971 and 1970.

Seasonally adjusted private housing starts--revised downward
slightly for December--advanced in January to a near-record annual
rate of 2.47 million units. As in December, the high over-all rate
may have reflected in part the stimulus resulting from rumors of the
freeze on new commitments under the subsidized housing programs; the
freeze did not become completely effective until the 9th of the month.
Unusually favorable weather conditions for this time of year were
also an important factor, particularly in the North Central States,
where the month-to-month increase in starts was especially marked.
The decline in building permits in January and other con-
siderations point to the probability that starts fell in February. Even
so, given the strength of January starts, the average for the first
quarter as a whole may be only moderately below the high 2.40 million
unit pace in the preceding quarter.

Seasonally adjusted sales of single-family homes by merchant
builders were at a record rate in the fourth quarter of 1972. However,
the quarterly average partly reflected an extraordinary October surge,
as shown in the table. Moreover, it was associated with a steady up-
trend in units available for sale to a new high of more than 400,000
units, or 6.7 months' supply even at the advanced December rate of
sales. While prices of homes sold rose appreciably in December partly
in response to upgraded demands, prices of unsold units also continued
upward--and in a period when completions of single and multifamily
units combined were moving above the 2 million unit annual rate for
the first time in the history of the series. Prices of used homes
sold in January were at a median price of $27,570--8 per cent above a
year earlier.

Capital spending plans. The most recent Commerce Department
plant and equipment survey (taken in late January and February) indi-
cates that businessmen now plan to increase spending by 13.8 per cent in
1973, as compared to the 12.9 per cent anticipated increase reported
in the December survey. Actual spending in 1972 was 8.9 per cent
higher than in 1971, according to the new survey.
For 1973, manufacturers now plan an 18 per cent increase,
substantially above the 1972 increase, with plans of durable goods
producers increasing more rapidly than those of nondurable goods. Out-
side of manufacturing, businessmen anticipate a gain of about 11-1/2
per cent--about the same as in 1972, with all sectors except railroads
and airlines participating in the rise.

Actual spending in the fourth quarter of 1972 was $0.4
billion below the level anticipated in the November survey. Current
plans now indicate annual rate increases of 21 per cent in the first
quarter and 14 per cent in the second--an upward revision from the
previous survey which indicated gains of 19 per cent and 5 per cent
in the respective quarters. A first look at the second half of 1973
shows spending growth tapering off as nondurable manufacturing spending
virtually levels off and gains in all other major categories moderate.
Newly approved capital appropriations of large manufacturing
firms rose 12.3 per cent in the fourth quarter according to the Con-
ference Board survey. Excluding the volatile petroleum industry, the
increase in the fourth quarter was 6.6 per cent. Experience indicates
that the bulk of new appropriations are spent within the following 2 to 3
quarters. Thus, these data tend to support the indications of continued
increases in spending anticipated during much or all of 1973.
Manufacturers orders and shipments. New orders for durable
goods rose 6.0 per cent (p) in January, following a 0.2 per cent decline
in December. Excluding defense, January durable goods orders were up
5.5 per cent. New orders for nondefense capital goods rose 4.5 per cent
further in January. Total durable goods orders have been rising
sharply since late 1970 and in January were 22 per cent above a year
earlier.
Durable goods shipments rose 6.0 per cent in January, with
particularly large gains in autos and aircraft. A sharp rise in
unfilled orders suggests appreciable strength in future shipments.
The rise in backlogs of nondefense capital goods industries is particu-
larly significant.

Inventories. Book value of manufacturing and trade inventories
rose at a $19.5 billion annual rate in January (p), the highest rate
since June 1966. Wholesale prices were rising rapidly, however, suggesting
that much of the book value increase represented higher prices. High
rates of book value growth occurred at wholesale and retail trade--mainly
in the nondurables sectors--but there was a reduced rate of increase at
manufacturing establishments. As in the fourth quarter, manufacturers'
finished goods stocks declined in January.

Sales increased even more rapidly than stocks and the inventory-
sales ratio declined from 1.46 to 1.43, the lowest since early 1966. The
ratio of durable goods manufacturers' inventories to unfilled orders de-
clined further, but is still high relative to earlier periods of expansion.

Cyclical indicators. The Census composite index of leading
indicators rose 1.2 per cent in January (p), following a December
increase of 1.0 per cent, revised down from 2.2 per cent. The coinci-
dent and lagging composites also rose in January. Compared with a year
earlier, the leading index was up 15 per cent, the coincident 13 per
cent, and the lagging 11 per cent.
Leading series increasing in January were initial unemployment
claims (inverted), new orders for durable goods, contracts and orders
for plant and equipment, common stock prices, industrial materials prices
and the ratio of price to unit labor cost. Series declining were the
manufacturing workweek and housing permits. Since the index was compiled,
increases have also been reported in the change in consumer instalment
debt and the change in book value of manufacturing and trade inventories.

Labor market. Demand for labor continued strong in February
as employment advanced markedly. The civilian labor force also in-
creased sharply, and the unemployment rate edged up 0.1 percentage
point to 5.1 per cent.
Employment expansion has been quite rapid since last July,
following a more moderate rate of advance in the early months of 1972.
Preliminary estimates for February indicate that payroll employment
increased by a substantial 440,000. (The January level, however, was
revised downward by 65,000). Much of the recent strength has been in
manufacturing where employment expansion had lagged during 1971 and the
first half of 1972. Outside of manufacturing, employment gains con-
tinued to accelerate in trade and services, but there has been some
moderation in the growth of State and local government employment.

Average weekly hours of factory production workers rebounded
by 0.7 hours in February following a sharp decline in the preceding
month. At 41 hours in February, the factory workweek was more than
half an hour longer than a year earlier, and was back to the high
levels reached in the autumn of 1968.
Unemployment and labor force. The unemployment rate in
February at 5.1 per cent seasonally adjusted, was about the same as in
the previous three months and well below a year ago. Joblessness among
adult women declined in February while teenage unemployment returned to
the high rate prevailing in the last months of 1972. The adult male
rate was about unchanged over the month, as were the rates for other
major groups. Reflecting the recent stability in total unemployment,
State insured unemployment has remained at about 1-1/2 million workers
during the past two months.

A sharp rise in the civilian labor force in February more
than offset the January decline. The February increase was concentrated
among women and teenagers, many of whom moved directly into part-time
jobs. Compared to a year earlier, the civilian labor force was up 1.9
million, considerably more than the "normal" growth of around 1-1/2
million.
Productivity. Fourth quarter estimates of productivity growth
have been revised down by over one half percentage point (annual rate),
due to downward revisions in the estimates of real gross national
product and manufacturing production. Compensation per manhour estimates
changed little, but unit labor costs were revised up considerably be-
cause of the reduced growth of productivity. Preliminary data for
January and February suggest some pick-up in the rate of manufacturing
productivity growth from the fourth quarter.

Earnings. The pace of wage increase has moderated in the past
2 months. The overall index has risen at an annual rate of less than
5 per cent since November after rising at a 7 per cent rate between
August and November. The latest data suggest that much of the accelera-
tion of wage increases last fall may have been temporary, probably due
to a surge of wage adjustments coming about a year after the freeze.
Nevertheless, wage increases have been more rapid--at about a 6 per cent
rate--over the past 6 months than in the preceding half year, with the
speed-up particularly noticeable in services and construction.
Compared to a year earlier, the private nonfarm hourly earnings index
in February was up by 5.6 per cent--about in line with stabilization
program goals--compared with a 6.4 per cent increase during the preceding
year.

Consumer prices. Consumer prices rose at a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 6-1/2 per cent in January as food costs
surged upward at a 25 per cent rate. Other commodity prices, however,
were unchanged after seasonal adjustment, and the annual rate of rise
in service costs was under 3 per cent. The "all items" index for
January--which was not yet appreciably influenced by Phase III
developments--was 3.7 per cent above January 1972.

The increase in January in the food-at-home component of the
index was the largest, seasonally adjusted, since this series was
first published in 1952. The rise reflected the combined effects of
soaring meat prices and sharp advances for poultry, eggs and fresh
fruits and vegetables. By the first week of February, when food is
priced for the CPI, retail meat prices had climbed further, accord-
ing to USDA's chainstore sample. Moreover, continued advances in
commodity markets to record-level prices for beef, pork, cattle and
hogs indicate another rise at retail for March. However, the declines
registered in the WPI in February for eggs and fresh vegetables may
provide a partial offset to meat price advances.
Among other commodity prices, declines in apparel and used
car prices offset the sharp increase for new cars that had been approved
by the Price Commission in December, Although the advance for services
was moderate, rents rose at a 5 per cent rate for the second successive
month and gas and electricity rates by more than any month since
December 1971.
Wholesale prices. Wholesale prices rose 1.6 per cent between
January and February, or at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 21 per
cent, as prices of farm and food products increased sharply for the
third consecutive month and prices of industrial commodities rose at
1.0 per cent, the largest monthly increase in 22 years.

Prices of farm and food products increased 3.2 per cent, or at
a seasonally adjusted rate of 46 per cent, which, except for last December, was
the highest since early 1951. Markedly higher prices posted for livestock
and meats, manufactured animal feeds, soybeans, and fats and oils more
than offset declines for fresh fruits and vegetables, grains, and eggs.
Increases for meats and processed poultry were largely responsible for
the increase in prices of consumer finished foods.
The index of industrial commodities increased more sharply
last month than at any time since early 1951. Both finished goods and

I -26
industrial materials indexes registered high rates of rise, reflecting
widespread and large price increases. The change in consumer finished
goods excluding foods was mainly the result of higher prices for non-
durables, including heating fuel, gasoline, cigarettes, footwear, and
apparel. Producer finished goods rose primarily because of the advance
in prices of machinery. Processed materials, supplies, and components
accelerated their upward price trend as lumber and plywood, nonferrous
metals, textile products, and electric power moved higher. Crude
materials also increased as a result of higher prices for scrap metal,
bituminous coal, and crude natural rubber.
Since the February pricing date of the WPI, prices of
raw industrials (BLS) have increased further, and higher prices have
been reported for lumber and plywood. Among industrial finished goods,
the prices of some imported cars have been increased and higher chemical
prices have been announced for some products. Tin mill products were
increased in price in mid-February and copper--as well as copper products--
tin, lead, and zinc are at higher levels. The petroleum industry was
placed under mandatory Phase III controls, but price increases for
heating fuels that were announced following the initiation of Phase III
were not rolled back by the Cost of Living Council.
Among agriculturally-based commodities, prices of steers,
hogs, and broilers have moved up since mid-February, and soy-beans,
coffee, eggs, and wool are all at higher levels. Most recently, corn
and wheat prices have declined and butter dropped following the announce-
ment of a cut in the support price,

I -27
Agriculture. Prices received by farmers increased 3.5 per
cent during the month ended February 15, Higher prices for soybeans, cattle,
hogs, and calves were partly offset by lower prices for wheat and eggs.
In early March, wheat and egg prices had reversed their decline and
soybean and livestock prices had increased further.
Devaluation of the dollar was a factor tending to increase
wheat and soybean prices, as were India's larger-than-expected
wheat purchases, With February cattle and hog slaughter slightly
below 1972 and 1971 levels, rising meat prices are attributable to
limited supplies as well as higher consumer demand,
With about one-fourth of the farmers expected to enter
the 1973 feed-grain program now signed up, it appears that acreage
taken out of production under the program may be 20 to 30 per cent
larger than hoped for by USDA, This could result in soybean and corn
plantings 2 to 3 per cent short of the 128 million acres targeted by
the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service in designing the
feed-grain program.
The average value per acre of farm real estate (including
improvements) increased 10 per cent during 1972, the largest increase
since 1951. The accompanying table shows changes in real estate
values by region and year. Factors causing the rise were high
commodity prices, attractive credit terms, and strong non-farm
demand for land.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL SITUATION
With money market conditions tightening and banks aggressively
issuing CD's and liquidating bills and other securities, most short-term
interest rates have risen from 50 to 75 basis points since the last
Committee meeting. In New York City, CD rates in early March reached
Regulation Q ceilings on maturities of 90 to 179 days, and most recently
shorter CD's--which have no rate ceiling--were being offered at 7 per
cent. A relatively wide gap still remains between the 90-day bill rate
and other short-term rates, largely in reflection of large foreign pur-
chases of bills in February.
Long-term bond rates have risen only 5 to 20 basis points since
the last meeting, reflecting a further drop in bond offerings. Since
mid-February there have been no issues of long-term nonconvertible cor-
porate bonds in the first three quality ratings, and the forward calendar
has failed to show the expected growth for March-April. Corporations,
with high liquidity and cash flow, have instead stepped-up their demand
for bank credit.
The extraordinary strength in bank loans to business has
reflected a substantial general increase in short-term credit demand
as well as a sizable shift from commercial paper borrowing to bank
loans, given the relationship between bank lending rates and short-term
market rates. A special Federal Reserve Bank survey suggests that most
large banks look upon the recent burst in loan demand as a cyclical
phenomenon that has been strengthened by shifts from the commercial
paper market. Only a few banks noted special foreign-related business

II -2
loan borrowing, but total loan increases have been buoyed by a signifi-
cant rise in credits to foreign commercial banks.
Along with the step-up in loan demand at commercial banks,
there has been a deceleration of consumer-type interest-bearing deposit
inflows, as market rates of interest increased. Banks have as a result
sold a large volume of CD's and liquidated Treasury and other securities.
Although thrift institutions also have faced a slowing of deposit inflows,
interest rates on home mortgages have edged up only slightly despite an
unusually large volume of loan commitments outstanding.
Outlook. The decision of common market nations to float their
currencies for the time being reduces the probability of any large near-
term dollar outflow. Whether or when reflows large enough to change
official reserve positions may develop is difficult to predict. In the
absence of reflows, the over $8 billion of special issues sold to foreign
official accounts in February and early March would suggest that the
Treasury may not have to finance in public markets between now and early
May.
Nevertheless, short-term market interest rates may continue
under upward pressure into the spring. Asset sales (partly for budgetary
window-dressing reasons) and regular financings by sponsored and budget-
ary agencies are now scheduled at $5.5 to $6.0 billion between now and
mid-year; this volume could rise if housing credit agencies are called
on to supplement funds in the mortgage market as interest rates rise.
In addition, banks can be expected to reduce holdings of liquid assets
and to continue their aggressive sales of CD's to finance loan expansion,
particularly if other deposit inflows slow further in an environment of

II -3
higher market yields. Regulation Q ceilings will force an increasing
share of such sales into the 30- to 89-day market range, bringing
particular upward rate pressures on shorter-term markets.
With liquidity at banks being reduced by loan demands and the
cost of bank funds rising, a tightening of lending policies can be
expected. Survey results suggest that a tightening of non-price terms
and conditions has already begun at the large banks. There are also
preliminary indications that the growth in unused commitments has been
somewhat slower recently at some banks. As loan policies become more
restrictive and in light of the recent narrowing of spreads between
short- and long-term interest rates, a step-up in long-term bond financ-
ing can be expected. Offerings could accelerate sharply if borrowers
become quite concerned about future fund availability.
While the higher level of market rates has already slowed
deposit inflows at the thrift institutions, these institutions have
sizable liquid asset holdings and a large unused capacity to borrow
from Home Loan Banks. As these institutions utilize available sources
of liquidity to finance large outstanding commitments, some upward ad-
justment in mortgage rates is likely to ensue, the willingness to make
new commitments will drop, and there will be increased builder and other
demands for commitments from FNMA, GNMA, and the FHLMC.

Monetary aggregates. In February, the money supply aggregates--
M1 and M2--both increased at annual rates of around 6 per cent. In the
case of M1, growth was about in line with the average rate for the
previous three months, but growth in M2 has slowed appreciably since
late last year.
The slower growth of M2 thus far in 1973 reflects a substantial
reduction in the rate of inflow of consumer-type time and savings
deposits associated with the sharp rise in market interest rates. At
large banks in February, passbook savings accounts declined (before
seasonal adjustment) for the third consecutive month, and consumer-type
time deposits also rose much less than in February of other recent
years.

With inflows of consumer-t pe time and savings deposits
moderating and credit demands accelerating, banks have been bidding
aggressively for funds through sales of large negotiable CD's. As a
result, outstanding CD's increased by $4.5 billion in February
(seasonally adjusted), the largest increase since July 1970, and further
rapid growth in CD sales continued at New York City banks in early
March. About $1 billion of the February increase apparently was
attributable to net CD sales to State and local governments, pre-
sumably reflecting in part the investment of funds received from the
December and January revenue sharing payments. Foreign accounts in
February also acquired about $250 million of CD's.
February sales of CD's were accompanied by increases of 50-65
basis points in CD offering rates. As a result, by early March,rates
offered by the New York City banks had moved up to the 6-3/4 per cent
Regulation Q ceiling on CD issues with maturities between 90 and 179
days. Since current interest rates on CD's with maturities just under
90 days are in some cases close to 7 per cent, it seems likely that
banks will now be forced to rely more heavily on the shorter maturity
CD's that have no regulatory ceiling. This would not represent any
marked change from recent months, however, since CD sales with
maturities over 90 days have averaged only about one-third of total
CD sales in this period.

II -7
The accelerated pace of CD sales in February was reflected
in a very rapid rate of growth in the bank credit proxy. Nondeposit
sources of funds did not rise, however, in part because rates on Euro-
dollars continued above comparable domestic rates.
The discount rate was raised to 5-1/2 per cent on February 26,
and, following a statement by the Committee on Interest and Dividends
removing its earlier objection, banks raised their prime rates from
6 to 6-1/4 per cent.
Bank Credit. Total bank credit continued to rise rapidly in
February reflecting extraordinarily strong loan demands, particularly
in the business loan sector. While the large CD growth helped to
finance much of this demand, banks also liquidated a substantial volume
of securities, chiefly Treasury issues. A large proportion of this
reduction was concentrated in short-term issues, and at the large weekly
reporting banks Treasury bills and short-term notes declined by almost
$3 billion during the month. As a result, liquidity ratios (the ratio
of liquid assets to liabilities) at both New York and other large banks
declined for the second consecutive month.
A sizable part of the increased credit demand at banks
represented a shift of business financing from the commercial paper
market, stimulated by the relatively low prime rate. Some indication
of the magnitude of this substitution can be seen in the table com-
paring changes in business loans and commercial paper. In February,
dealer-placed commercial paper declined $2 billion (after seasonal
adjustment) while bank loans increased by $5.3 billion, resulting in a
combined increase for the two categories of over $3 billion, or at an

II -8
annual rate of 27 per cent. Thus, factors other than the refunding of
commercial paper also appear to have contributed to the rapid increase
in business borrowing from banks.

In order to provide information on what other factors were
primarily responsible for rising business credit demands, a special
Federal Reserve Bank survey was taken of business loan developments in
January and February at 10 large banks in each district. In all districts
most respondents attributed a sizable proportion of the increased demand
to cyclical factors, with the second most important factor being the
relative attractiveness of the cost of bank credit compared to commercial
paper rates. However, except for New York banks, only a few of the
respondents contacted suggested that as much as 50 per cent of loan demand

II -10
represented a shift from commercial paper markets, with 5 to 25 per
cent being a more frequent estimate.1/
In general, the survey also indicated that--except for San
Francisco and a few banks in Cleveland and New York--very little of
the business borrowing was associated with transactions in foreign finan-
cial markets, with most banks estimating that the proportion was below
5 per cent. Even in New York only 3 out of 10 banks questioned included
foreign developments as a significant factor influencing business loan
demand.
On the other hand, there was a significant increase in bank
loans to foreign commercial banks (not included in business loans),
which rose by $1.3 billion during February and another $300 million at
New York City banks in early March. In August of 1971, during a previous
period of dollar outflows, such loans had increased $1 billion. The
foreign commercial bank borrowers, drawing on lines with U.S. banks,
have no doubt been positioning themselves to take advantage of changing
exchange rates, and the staff expects such loans to be repaid soon after
exchange markets stabilize.
Preliminary analysis of the lending practices and loan commit-
ment surveys, taken in January, suggests that there has been a signifi-
cant tightening of the non-price terms and conditions of bank lending
and reduced willingness to make loans, compared with three months
previous. In addition, unused commitments to lend appear to have grown
more slowly in the three months ending in January at some banks.
1/ Board staff analysis of the underlying data had suggested that as
much as half of the aggregate rise in business loans in February may
have been associated with a decline in commercial paper financing.

II -11
A more detailed analysis of these surveys will be presented in the
supplement to the Greenbook.
In addition to the rise in business loans and loans to
foreign commercial banks, growth in real estate and consumer loans
remained near the high levels of recent months. There was also a
seasonally adjusted increase in loans to nonbank financial institutions,
both to finance companies and others. As indicated below, finance
companies in February increased their borrowing in the commercial
paper market as well, reflecting their need to finance increased
lending to consumers and business.

II- 12
Commercial paper outstanding. Total commercial paper
outstanding declined $1.0 billion in February, on a seasonally adjusted
basis, following a small rise in the preceding month. While both
bank-related paper and nonbank-related directly placed paper increased
over the month, nonbank-related dealer placed paper dropped $2.0
billion. Beginning about mid-January, changed relationships between
market interest rates and the bank prime rate have induced some firms,
mainly industrial and utility companies, to shift from the selling of
commercial paper to the use of bank lines of credit. Despite the rise
in the prime rate to 6-1/4 per cent in late February, further increases
in the cost of dealer placed paper have reportedly induced firms to
continue this shift in early March.
The rise in bank-related paper in February amounted to $400
million, substantially more than the $55 million average monthly increase
recorded over the past year. Nonbank-related paper issued directly
also rose much faster than last year, with the lower cost of directly-
placed paper compared with dealer placed paper in part limiting any
shifting to bank financing. While all types of nonbank-related direct
issuers contributed to the increase in outstandings, the finance company
subsidiaries of automotive and electrical equipment manufacturers
accounted for the largest share of this growth, using the proceeds to
finance in part their expanding portfolios of consumer and business
receivables.

Consumer credit. Total consumer credit outstanding rose at
a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $24.7 billion in January, somewhat
below the peak December volume. Almost all of the increase was in the
instalment credit component, which advanced at a record annual rate of
$23.4 billion, more than 13 per cent above the previous high in November.
Auto credit, which posted its third consecutive record monthly rise,
accounted for nearly half of the overall increase in instalment debt.
Another large increase in total consumer credit probably occurred
during February in view of the continued high rate of automobile sales,
substantial apparent sales gains posted by the major credit-granting
retail chains, and unusually favorable weather in most areas of the
country.

Despite advances in most market interest rates during recent
months, consumer borrowing costs at commercial banks have risen very
little. Bank rates on direct new car loans in January--approximately
10.0 per cent--were about unchanged from the fourth quarter and remained
well under year-earlier levels. In February, rates on auto loans
edged up 4 basis points, but other consumer loan rates, while up from
January, remained within the range of fluctuation of other recent months.
In order to hold down monthly auto loan payments in the face
of the increasing size of new car contracts, there have been reports
that lenders are extending more maturities beyond the customary 36-month
term. However, the percentage of extended contracts at finance companies
has increased only slightly in recent months--from 1.2 per cent in
October to 1.4 per cent in January. Moreover, the weighted average term
has remained unchanged over this period at 34.9 months. While aggregate
data of a similar nature are not available for commercial banks, an
informal survey indicates that only a few banks are making extended-
maturity loans at the present time.
Delinquency rates on automobile loans at finance companies
and commercial banks showed a tendency to increase in the second half
of 1972. On the other hand, delinquency rates for all types of loans
at credit unions have tended lower in recent months, and personal bank-
ruptcies decreased nearly 8 per cent last year following a similar
decline in 1971. Part of the decline in bankruptcies is attributable
to an institutional change--enactment of Federal limitations on garnish-
ment practices--as well as improved consumer economic positions. To the

II- 15
extent that financially troubled borrowers are now under less pressure
to file for personal bankruptcy, this legislative change may also be
contributing to higher delinquency rates on loans at banks and finance
companies.
Nonbank thrift institutions. Growth of deposits at nonbank
savings institutions, like that of consumer-type accounts at banks,
slowed considerably during February, most likely due to the increased
attractiveness of yields on alternative investments. At mutual savings
banks, the slowdown was most apparent for institutions in New York City,
but it was evident in other areas as well. Moreover, according to FHLBB
sample data, the slowing of savings inflows to S&L's also was a
general one, although to some extent the reduction may be overstated
because of seasonal adjustment problems.

During the month of February, S&L's increased their borrowings
at the Home Loan Banks by approximately $100 million. While the amount
is not large, this borrowing appears to be contraseasonal in view of
the substantial repayments in February of other recent years. The
fragmentary data available for outstanding commitments at the end of
February suggest little change from the high level in January. Given
reduced deposit flows, however, the ratio of commitments to cash flows
in February probably edged up further. If deposit flows continue at
a reduced rate, prospective cash flow appears insufficient to support
the recent rate of new commitment activity while meeting scheduled take-
downs on outstandings. Thus, increased borrowing at the Home Loan
Banks, as well as a tightening of S&L lending policies, would be
in prospect for the near term.

II -17
Short-term markets. Conditions in the money market continued
to firm in the past 4 weeks with the Federal funds rate rising to about
7 per cent, roughly 40 basis points above its level at the time of the
last FOMC meeting. The further advance in the funds rate provided
additional impetus to the general uptrend in short-term rates which
has been particularly pronounced since early December.
As noted earlier, commercial banks recently have been
exceptionally aggressive in bidding for short-term money in the CD
market, and their activity contributed to the general upward pressure
on CD rates, carrying the rate on issues with 90 to 179 days up 50
basis points to the Regulation Q ceiling of 6.75 per cent. Moreover,
some banks recently have posted offering rates of 7 per cent on their
CD's with maturities of 60 to 89 days, about 90 basis points higher than
the rates offered at the time of the last meeting. With corporate
borrowing shifting from the commercial paper market to banks, because
of the attractiveness of the relatively low prime rate, rates on dealer
placed commercial paper have been subject to much less direct market
pressure. Nonetheless, the rate on new issues with 90 to 119 day
maturity moved in general sympathy with other short-term rate to advance
about 50 basis points to 6.63 per cent over the inter-meeting period.
The Treasury bill market has continued to be influenced by the
foreign exchange crisis in recent weeks. Using dollars accumulated in
the latest attempt to support the dollar against speculative attack,
foreign central banks, in the early days of March, acquired a substantial

II -18
volume of bills and coupon issues in the market as well as a large
block of special issues directly from the Treasury. Despite this
direct addition to market demands and the sharp reduction in the
potential supply of new issues to be brought to market in the near term,
Treasury bill rates rose about 70 to 90 basis points in the 6-month to
1-year maturity area and about 60 basis points in shorter maturity
areas. These marked increases reflected the strong further pull of
the Federal funds rate and were accentuated near the end of the period
by dealer expectations that foreign official buying would soon end and
might be partially reversed. Even after these recent advances, the
spread between the funds rate and bill rates remains quite large.
Since early December, the Federal funds rate has risen about 200 basis
points, while Treasury bill rates have increased about 110 to 125 basis
points.
Treasury coupon issues and financing outlook. Market yields
on intermediate term Treasury coupon issues have also moved significantly
higher (about 25 to 40 basis points) in recent weeks, apparently
responding mainly to the general rise in short-term rates. Yields on
long-term Treasury issues (with 10 years or more to maturity) on the
other hand, have shown only moderate increases. Foreign central bank
investment activity has, of course, helped to temper the size of the
advance in these yields. In addition, as this demand persisted,
dealers took the opportunity to move into substantial net short positions

II -19
in coupon issues due in more than one year, so the coupon market is
presently in a very strong technical position.
Altogether foreign official accounts acquired about $175
million of additional coupon issues in the market during early March
following their February purchases of such issues which cumulated over
the month to about $800 million. In addition,these institutions
obtained about $450 million of bills in the market and approximately
$3.4 billion of special issues from the Treasury in early March, thereby
supplementing their February investments in bills of $1.0 billion and
special issues of $5 billion. Assuming no significant reversal of
dollar flows over the near-term, it seems likely that the recent invest-
ment by foreign central banks in special issues of the Treasury will
eliminate the Treasury's need to enter the market until the May refunding.
However, the Treasury may still decide to issue $2 billion of
a 2-year note in late March or early April in order to fulfill its
earlier commitment to continue their cycle through mid-year. Moreover,
Federal agency borrowing over the next few months is expected to be
fairly heavy. For sponsored and budgetary agencies combined, borrowing
through mid-year may amount to as much as $6 billion. Finally, the
market supply of Treasury bills probably will be expanded in late March
and early April, as the System makes open market sales to offset the
reserve effects of a decline in the Treasury's cash balance, which may
amount to as much as $3 billion.

Other long-term securities markets. Yields on long-term
securities moved higher between mid-February and early March, reflect-
ing rising rates in short-term markets and increased apprehension con-
cerning prospective interest rate and price developments. The rise in
corporate bond yields, judging from the behavior of yields on recently
offered issues, amounted to less than 20 basis points over this period,
while long-term municipal yields rose a little more. Upward yield
pressures in the corporate market have been limited, however, by the
very low current and prospective volume of new public issues and by
sizable demands for bonds from pension funds and newly formed mutual
funds that invest principally in bonds. In the municipal market, con-
tinuing substantial demands by fire and casualty companies for longer-
term bonds have limited the rise in the widely watched indices, but
significantly reduced bank participation has put upward rate pressure
on the short- and intermediate-term maturity areas.
The volume of corporate public bond offerings in March is
projected at $1.1 billion, a substantial increase from the preceding
month, but well below the monthly average in 1972. Underwriters con-
tinue to report an unusually light prospective volume of industrial
bond issues, and the calendar for April at present contains a minimal
volume of utilities. Moreover, the March-April period generally
represents a seasonal pick-up in offerings, and the projected volumes
indicate an unseasonally low level of corporate public bond flotations.

To some extent, the reduction in demands for funds in the
corporate public bond market is associated with increased reliance on
internally generated funds and shorter-term credit. In addition, some
firms with access to the public bond market have entered the private
placement market in view of the attractive arrangements available from
insurance companies. These companies reportedly have been intensifying
their search for privately placed bonds given their increasing flow of
investible funds. Furthermore, issues of stock have continued at
historically high levels, despite the general decline in stock prices
since mid-January. Public utilities especially continue to rely heavily
on stock issues compared with public bonds; even aside from the $500
million AT&T issue in the March total, there are about $900 million of
other equity issues by utilities.
Stock prices rose at first in response to the news of the
devaluation of the U.S. dollar in mid-February. However, within a few
days equity prices began a decline which lasted through early March,
as the stock market reflected uncertainties about international exchange
rate adjustments as well as concern about domestic price and credit
developments. Since the beginning of March there has been a small rise
in prices on balance, and trading volume on the major exchanges has
been moderate.
State and local government bond flotations in both March and
April are projected to total about $1.6 billion per month, or roughly

II -24
one-fifth below the average monthly pace in 1972. The volume of
general obligations has declined, perhaps reflecting the strengthened
fiscal position of governmental units. But the total volume has not
declined as much due to a growing amount of revenue bond issues, for
pollution control and other purposes.

II -25
Mortgage market. Field reports and other sources suggest
that rates on home mortgages have come under some upward pressure in
both the secondary and the primary markets during recent weeks.
Yields on FNMA's commitments to purchase Government underwritten home
mortgages continued to edge higher (by 2 basis points) in the latest
bi-weekly auction of March 5. At 7.75 per cent, the average auction
yield was 22 basis points above the recent low reached early last year,
and 1 basis point above the 1972 high registered in October.
Given the growing uncertainty about future savings flows and
interest rate developments, some saving and loan associations and other
types of mortgage investors have apparently been concentrating their
secondary market purchases on loans available for immediate--rather than
deferred--delivery. A few other investors are said to have withdrawn
temporarily from the secondary market, especially (in the case of
diversified institutions) in view of the narrow yield spreads between
home mortgages and new issues of high-grade corporate bonds. As a
result, offerings of conventional as well as Government-underwritten
home mortgages to FNMA and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation
have been rising somewhat.
In the primary market during February, average interest rates
on conventional mortgages edged up by 5 basis points on both new- and
existing-home loans, following a 4-month period of stability. At 7.75
per cent on new-home loans and 7.80 per cent on existing-home loans,
the rates were the highest in more than a year but were still somewhat
below August 1971 levels.

(excluding additional initial fees and charges) are rounded by
FHA to the nearest 5 basis points. On FHA loans carrying the
7 percent ceiling rate in effect since mid-February 1971, a change
of 1.0 points in discount is associated with a change of 12 to 14
basis points in yield. Gross yield spread is average mortgage

new Aaa utility bonds.
e/ Estimated.
Federal finance. Federal receipts and expenditures in January
and February have come in about as previously expected. Therefore, the
staff is maintaining its fiscal 1973 forecast of $228.0 billion on
receipts and continues to accept the Administration's fiscal 1973 fore-
cast of $249.8 billion on outlays. The forecasted deficit thus remains
at $21.8 billion on a unified budget basis. On a NIA basis the corre-
sponding figures are $236.3 billion for fiscal 1973 receipts and $259.5
billion for fiscal 1973 expenditures, with a resultant deficit of $23.2
billion.

II -27
The long anticipated bulge in tax refunds seems to be material-
izing. Early returns requesting refunds show a significantly higher
refund per return than last year. In total, however, refund payments
thus far are lower than expected, partly because of processing delays
within the Internal Revenue Service. Therefore, the peak period for
refunds, which normally begins in early March, may be delayed this year
until April.
The Treasury cash balance was $11.8 billion at the end of
February, $4.8 billion higher than projected in the last Greenbook.
This was entirely due to $5.0 billion in purchases of nonmarketable
securities by foreign central banks during the month. Through the first
seven days of March continued inflows of dollars to foreign central
banks prompted their purchase of an additional $3.4 billion of these
special issues. Because of these unexpected financings, we are now pro-
jecting a rather high end of March cash balance of $11.0 billion.
In order to limit the increase in Treasury tax and loan
accounts resulting from foreign central bank purchases of special
Treasury certificates, the Treasury's balance at the Federal Reserve
has recently been allowed to rise to around $4 billion. Net cash drains
on the total Treasury balance between now and mid-April are expected to
be approximately $7.5 billion. However, the mid-April seasonal increase
in tax receipts should raise the balance to approximately $10.0 billion
by April 30. No Treasury borrowing is anticipated until late May or
early June.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
Summary and outlook. Amid conditions of turmoil in the
exchange markets, the past few weeks have seen a further substantial
depreciation of the dollar and a widespread recourse to floating for
major currencies.
A massive flight from the dollar in early February, the first
part of which was described in the February 7 Greenbook, culminated in
the official closing of European and Japanese exchange markets and
immediately thereafter the devaluation of the dollar by 10 per cent
while most major continental European currencies kept their par values
(in terms of SDRs or gold) unchanged. The yen and the lira were allowed
to float, and the Swiss franc, pound sterling, and the Canadian dollar
continued to float. European exchange markets reopened on February 14.
Less than 10 days later, the dollar was again subject to
massive sales by private holders and European and Japanese markets were
again "closed." On March 11 it was announced that the remaining EC
currencies which had maintained "fixed" rates would join in a common
float against the dollar, and on the following day the German mark was
again revalued, by 3 per cent. In recent days the yen has been trading
at about 20 per cent above its Smithsonian central rate.
Exchange markets are to reopen on March 19, when the currencies
of all of the other G-10 countries plus Switzerland, countries which
combined account for nearly two-thirds of U.S. trade, will be floating
against the dollar.

III -2
Dominating the decisions governments have taken during the
past several weeks, and influencing the further discussions still
taking place this week, have been these facts: (1) the basic dis-
equilibrium in the U.S. balance of payments is still large, (2)
countries like Germany and Switzerland receiving speculative inflows
want to end the flooding of liquidity into their economies that such
inflows bring, (3) the European countries fear that floating -- in
order to make things difficult for speculators -- might produce such
further appreciations of their currencies as to work excessive hardships
on their export industries.
There is a general consensus in finance ministries and central
banks that the exchange rate structure as it now stands should move
international payments toward equilibrium more surely and more quickly
than the Smithsonian rates could. It is also generally recognized that
there may be adverse effects initially as prices of U.S. imports move
up in terms of the U.S. dollar.
Staff projections of U.S. exports and imports of goods and
services take into account this adverse immediate effect on the value
of imports, and also the effect of the devaluation in accentuating the
recent and prospective increases in U.S. export prices, with immediate
favorable effects in raising the dollar value of exports. The projections
also assume that after the cumulated exchange rate changes of the past
22 months, the lags in reaction time will now be shorter than was expected

III -3
after the Smithsonian realignment. The reduction in real quantities
of imports will follow the rise in dollar import prices with less lag,
because foreign producers are now less able to cut their domestic-
currency prices than they were last year, and because potential U.S.
producers of import substitutes are now placed in a better competitive
position. Similarly, the reactions of foreign buyers of U.S. exports
to the lower foreign-currency prices of our goods, and the reactions
of U.S. producers to the increased profitability of exporting, will
be speeded up.
The excess of imports of goods and services over exports is
projected as increasingfrom $3 billion (annual rate) in the first
quarter of this year to $4-1/2 billion in the second quarter, and then
declining to zero by the fourth quarter.
The projected degree of effectiveness of the exchange rate
changes in promoting improvement in the current account balance depends
heavily on the assumption that U.S. price and cost inflation will remain
fairly moderate, despite the additional upward thrust on all dollar
prices of goods entering international trade or competing with imports.
Foreign exchange markets. Large-scale intervention purchases
of dollars by foreign central banks began on February 1 and amounted to
$8.2 billion by February 9, with most of the reserve gains accruing to
Germany. After the close of businesson February 9, Germany announced
that its market would be officially closed on Monday, February 12.
Other European countries and Japan quickly followed suit. The President

III -4
had decided on February 6 to take the lead in trying to find a
resolution of the crisis and following intensive weekend discussions
among Mr. Volcker and various European and Japanese officials,
Secretary Shultz announced on the evening of February 12 that the
dollar would be devalued by 10 per cent. European exchange markets
reopened on February 14 with 11.1 per cent increases in central rates
against the dollar for the mark, guilder, French franc, and Belgian
franc. The lira was allowed to float. The Japanese market reopened
the following day with the yen floating.
After about a week of calm, during which the Bundesbank sold
off nearly a billion dollars while the Japanese yen floated to around
16 to 17 per cent over its Smithsonian central rate, a new speculative
rush into Swiss francs and gold developed into a general pressure on
dollar exchange rates. The dollar, near its ceiling in Europe on
Wednesday, February 21, dropped to its floor by Friday the 23rd.
Fueled by statements from various European officials that the next
speculative attack on their currencies would be met by a joint EC
float, and from U.S. officials that the devaluation alone would not
be sufficient to produce the desired U.S. trade surplus, the market
bet heavily on an upward float of EC currencies. On March 1, European
central banks had to buy $3.6 billion, with $2.7 billion accounted for
by the German Federal Bank alone. After the close of business on March 1,
Germany announced that its market would not reopen the following day.

III -5
Other European countries (except France) and Japan followed suit.
The French market was open for only 1-1/2 hours on Friday, March 2,
during which time the Bank of France purchased $400 million.
Exchange markets have remained officially closed since then,
while EC finance ministers, G-10 finance ministers and central bank
governors, and G-10 deputies held a series of meetings in Paris and
Brussels. On Sunday evening, March 11, it was announced that Germany,
France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Denmark would float jointly
against the dollar while maintaining an unchanged width of permissible
spreads among their own currencies. On March 12 Germany announced a
3 per cent revaluation of the mark, and on March 13 Austria announced
a 2-1/4 revaluation of the schilling and said that the schilling would
be pegged to the mark. Another G-10 meeting is scheduled for Friday,
March 16.
During this period of official "closed" markets -- meaning
that central banks did not deal in the markets -- the actual volume
of trading was minimal. The great uncertainties over the governments'
future course of action were reflected in wide bid-ask spreads; large
variations in rates were produced by relatively small transactions.
The dollar traded generally at about 3-5 per cent below its February 14
floors against EC currencies. Following news of the joint float, the
German revaluation and reports alleging a U.S. intention to intervene
in the market to produce "orderly conditions," the dollar firmed fairly
sharply on Tuesday (March 13) against European currencies, while the
yen advanced to around 20 per cent above its Smithsonian central rate.

III -6
Euro-dollar market. The speculative pressure on the dollar
in foreign exchange markets over the past month caused sharp increases
in Euro-dollar interest rates as transactors attempted to increase
their dollar-denominated liabilities relative to dollar-denominated
assets. For the month of February, the average overnight Euro-dollar
rate exceeded the average Federal funds rate by nearly 2-3/4 percentage
points, reversing the pattern of recent months when U.S. banks had
found reserve-free overnight Euro-dollar borrowing slightly less
expensive than borrowing in the Federal funds market. Rates on 1-month
and 3-month Euro-dollar deposits also increased, moving more than a
percentage point further above comparable maturity CD
rates, despite increases in the latter.
Pressures on the liquidity position of banks in the Euro-
dollar market were undoubtedly among the chief causes of a $3.7 billion
outflow of funds from the United States through inter-bank transactions
in the 5 weeks through February 28. Weekly reporting banks' loans to
foreign commercial banks increased by $1.4 billion. Liabilities to
commercial banks abroad were reduced by $2.3 billion, including a
$1.0 decline in liabilities of U.S. banks to their foreign branches and a
$1.2 billion decline in foreign liabilities reported by New York agencies
and branches of foreign banks.
In the first week of March, despite the massive speculative
attack of March 1, the overnight Euro-dollar rate eased while 1-month
and 3-month deposit rates rose further. The net outflow of funds through

III -7
inter-bank transactions appears to have been relatively small in
that week. Loans to foreign commercial banks were up by $0.5
billion, but liabilities of U.S. banks to their foreign branches
rose by $0.7 billion, as banks acted to preserve their reserve-free
bases. Other liabilities to commercial banks abroad, including
those reported by the foreign agencies and branches here, continued
to decline, decreasing by $0.35 billion.
In recent days all Euro-dollar rates have tended to ease,
with the overnight Euro-dollar rate dropping back to within less
than a percentage point of the Federal funds rate.

Prospective longer-run effects of dollar devaluation. The
recent exchange rate changes described above, together with the
Smithsonian changes of 1971, are summarized in the table on the next
page. The recent changes have resulted in an effective devaluation
of the U.S. dollar against all foreign currencies of roughly 8 per
cent. The cumulative effective devaluation since 1970 comes to about
17 per cent. This is a large devaluation, and it cannot help but
have large effects, even though the size of those effects cannot be
calculated with any degree of certainty. The devaluation has been
particularly large against Japan and the industrial countries of
Continental Europe.
There is considerable uncertainty about the net effect of
the latest devaluation on the U.S. trade and payments position during
1973. Our staff expects the effect to be about neutral, with adverse
initial effects during the first half year roughly offset by favorable
effects later in the year. Other analysts have reached somewhat more
pessimistic conclusions.
But there is general agreement that the latest devaluation,
together with the lagged effects of earlier exchange rate changes, offers
scope for a very considerable improvement in the U.S. trade and payments
position during 1974 and 1975, provided that domestic inflationary
pressures can be contained, and provided that foreign surplus countries
are willing to accept a decline in their trade and payments surpluses.

Business cycle conditions here and abroad also seem likely to contribute
to an improvement in U.S. trade in late 1973 and 1974, after having
been markedly adverse during 1972 and early 1973. As a result, it is
now expected that while the U.S. merchandise trade balance, which was

III -10
in deficit by $6.8 billion in 1972, may decline only moderately to
around $5 billion for the year 1973, it will be improving sharply
by the end of the year. During the course of 1974, the trade
balance should move into surplus, and the surplus could well reach
substantial proportions in 1975.
It is too early to predict whether the trade surplus
achievable in 1975 will be sufficient for full equilibrium in the
U.S. balance of payments in that year, since much will depend on
policies and other developments here and abroad. But the achievement
of a very large favorable swing in the U.S. trade accounts which can
confidently be expected will at least provide solid evidence that
balance of payments adjustment on a large scale is possible after
all.

III -11
U.S. foreign trade, Both exports and imports rose very sharply
in January. The trade deficit was estimated to be at an annual rate of
$4-1/4 billion (balance of payments basis), substantially lower than
the downward revised deficit of $5-1/2 billion in December. (Originally
a deficit rate of $7 billion had been reported for December.) Revisions
in the trade data for 1971 and 1972 stem from the usual practice of the
Census Bureau to update and adjust its seasonal adjustment factors and
to make other statistical revisions at the beginning of each year.

resulting from the introduction in January of new statistical classifications
used in reporting imports, led to the exclusion of a sizable amount of
imports from the reported value of imports in January. Most of the
imports excluded will be entered in the import figures for February
and possibly March. The amount involved can not be determined until
the compilation of the February data, but a rough guess would indicate
that a half or more of the January trade improvement may have resulted
from this statistical aberration. The discussion below of the January
trade data makes no allowance for these omitted imports.
The reduction in the reported trade deficit from December to
January stemmed from an extraordinarily sharp rise in exports -- 9 percent --
while the rise in imports, also large, was relatively less at 6 percent.
Despite continued strong increases in export prices (unit-
values) of foodstuffs and other agricultural products, price increases
accounted for only a small portion of the overall increase in the value
of exports from December to January. About one-half of the export
increase resulted from a steep rise in shipments of agricultural
commodities, particularly corn and soybeans. The total value of
agricultural exports in January was over $14-1/2 billion at an annual
rate, compared to a rate of $11 billion in the fourth quarter. Large
shipments to the Soviet Union accounted for only a small portion of
the January rise; the bulk of the increase in agricultural exports
went to Japan and Western Europe.

III -13
Although the value of agricultural exports will remain strong,
being buoyed by a continuing large rise in dollar prices, partially
induced by the recent devaluation, it is unlikely that the January rate
can be sustained. We are projecting the value of agricultural exports
for the full year 1973 at about $12 billion.
Exports of nonagricultural products also increased in January
although at a slower pace than for agricultural products. Deliveries
of machinery continued the strong advance which began in mid-1972.
Foreign orders for U.S. machinery were at a high level in January but
the backlog of orders failed to rise as shipments kept pace with new
orders. Exports of nonagricultural industrial materials held at the
relatively high level of recent months. There were further rises in
exports of coal, paper products, chemicals and other nonmetal products.
Steel shipments also rose further but exports of other metals fell.
With rising domestic output of cars and business equipment, it is
quite possible that domestic producers of metals and other industrial
materials may find it more difficult to accept and meet orders for
these products from foreign customers, and this may limit the rise
of such exports.
Exports of consumer goods (other than autos) continue to
show surprising strength, rising further in January over the relatively
high level of shipments of the last half of 1972. Shipments of
automobile parts to Canada picked up from the relatively low December
value as Canadian car production, largely for export to the United
States advanced.

III -14
Preliminary information suggests that the Smithsonian Agreement
may have produced a halt in the downward drift of the U.S. share in
world trade of manufactured goods in 1972. If this has in fact occurred,
it would be the first year since 1968 that the U.S. share has not
declined.
Imports in January, although overshadowed by the strong rise
in exports, were nevertheless very strong. About one-third of the
6 percent increase in value over December reflected higher average
prices. The import expansion in January was broadly based,with all
major categories recording large increases. Imports of industrial
materials continued the advance that prevailed throughout 1972, despite
a decline in arrivals of steel and little change in petroleum imports.
The value of imports of lumber (boosted by higher prices), paper,
copper and other metals (aside from steel) all rose. In addition,
however, the value of imports of foodstuffs (coffee and sugar) which
had been virtually stable since the middle of 1972, also rose in
January.
In January, imports of capital goods and consumer items
(other than cars) continued the new advance that had begun in the
closing months of 1972 reflecting the growing strength of domestic
comsumption and investment. Entries of foreign cars were also up
sharply in January; imports had been generally flat throughout 1972.
This rise in car imports was probably in response to increased sales in
the United States, which were about 1.9 million units at an annual rate

III -15
in each month from November through January. In November and December
this level of sales involved drawing down inventories of imported cars.
Following the U.S. devaluation on February 12 and the floating
of the yen, sales of foreign cars rose even more strongly as buyers
accelerated purchases in anticipation of a rise in foreign car prices.
Foreign cars claimed about 16 percent of total domestic car sales in
January and February; in 1972 their share had fallen to under 15 percent
from a peak of 15-1/2 percent in 1971.
U.S. balance of payments. The over-all balance on the official
settlements basis swung from a surplus of about $1/2 billion in January
to an estimated $7-1/2 billion in February (not annual rates), and an
additional $4-1/4 billion deficit was posted in the first week of
March.
The large movement of speculative funds in February and early
March obscures the basic balance of payments position. Such data as
are available for January indicate that the over-all surplus was the
net result of substantial private capital inflows exceeding the con-
tinuing, though reduced, deficit on current account and Government
capital transactions.
Foreign purchases of U.S. securities were still extremely
strong in January; stock purchases are estimated to have been $475
million in January, almost equal to last November's peak figure.
Further large foreign purchases of U.S. stocks occurred immediately

III -16
after the dollar devaluation in February, but buying soon fell off.
Foreign purchases of U.S. bonds, particularly offshore issues, were
also at a high level in January and probably also declined in February.
Bank claims on foreigners were reduced in January by about the
normal seasonal amount, and increased sharply in February and early
March according to weekly banking statistics. As noted above in
connection with Eurodollar market developments, the outflow of loans
to foreign commercial banks was particularly large.
Preliminary data for the fourth quarter indicate that the
basic balance (current account plus private long-term capital flows)
was showing considerable improvement: it was at an annual rate of about
$5-1/2 billion, down sharply from the $9 billion rate of the third quarter.

Improvement occurred in both the current and capital accounts.
While the trade deficit increased in the fourth quarter, this was more
than offset by an unexpected jump in net income receipts from investments
abroad. A similar increase in these receipts occurred in the fourth
quarter of 1971 but proved to be a temporary bulge, and the same may be
true of the late 1972 rise.
Private long-term capital showed a sizable inflow in the
fourth quarter in contrast to an outflow in the third quarter. Outflows
for direct investment abroad by U.S. companies were relatively low.
Foreign purchases of U.S. securities -- both stocks and bonds -- were
at a record high.
Recorded flows of private short-term capital showed a
substantial net inflow in the fourth quarter. Some short-term
outflows were probably reflected in the residual errors and omission
item.

The German, U.K. and Canadian Budgets. Three major
countries have introduced budgets within the last four weeks.
The British and Canadian budgets are intended to promote continued
rapid real growth. The German budget moves fiscal policy in the
direction of greater restrictiveness; the objective is to moderate
severe inflation in Germany, a task which has been complicated
by the heavy speculative inflows of recent weeks,
The U.K. budget for the fiscal year beginning April 1
included no significant tax changes and is intended to be con-
sistent with continued real growth in GNP of about 5 per cent,
annual rate, through the first half of 1974. The government's
fiscal plans for 1973-74 are thought to represent a compromise
between two conflicting policy prescriptions. One implied a more
restrictive budget in order to combat inflation and foster im-
provement in the current account of the balance of payments. It
urged cuts in government expenditures and measures to slow growth
in consumer spending. The other called for fiscal measures to
increase growth of real disposable income -- principally by reduced
indirect taxes -- on the grounds that such actions would be more
likely to win labor's acceptance of the government's wage-price
policies. The balance of payments, this view contends, need not
inhibit stimulative domestic policies so long as sterling is allowed
to float.

III -19
The budget is expected to result in a public sector
borrowing requirement of about £4.4 billion, or close to 8 per
cent of projected GNP for this period. (The public sector includes
the central government, local authorities, and the nationalized
industries.) This compares with the estimated borrowing requirement
for fiscal 1973-73 of £2.85 billion.
The increase in the borrowing requirement reflects
planned increases in public sector expenditures on goods and
services, but also stepped up grants to industry and changes
in the timing of receipts from indirect taxes arising from the
introduction of the Valued Added Tax (VAT) on April 1. The VAT
rate will be 10 per cent, the government having rejected recom-
mendations to impose a lower rate to ease upward pressure on
retail prices. However, VAT will not be imposed on food and
children's clothing, both previously subject to the purchase
tax.
Concern over the expansionary impact on the money
supply of the anticipated huge deficit prompted the government
to introduce several innovations to encourage non-bank corporations
and individuals to invest in public sector debt in various forms.
The intent is to minimize financing of the debt by the banking
system.

III -20
At present, the British economy is still experiencing
a vigorous recovery. Growth in real GNP from the second half of
1971 to the first half of 1973 is expected to be about 4-1/2 per
cent, with the rate in the fourth quarter of 1972 having been
close to the targeted 5 per cent. The revival in growth has
been marked by a sharp reduction in unemployment (even though
employment in industry actually declined). The jobless rate in
February was 2.9 per cent, down from 3.8 per cent a year earlier.
Inflation, of course, has been a major problem. Even after
institution of the wage-price freeze in November, prices of
uncontrolled items -- notably food and imported materials --
have continued to rise sharply. Lack of labor support for the
government's prices and incomes policy suggests, moreover, that
inflation will intensify.
In disclosing its budget for calendar 1973 last month,
the German government announced two key deflationary steps: a DM 4
billion "stability loan" and a non-refundable 10 per cent sur-
charge, effective July 1, on income tax paid by corporations,
single persons with an income over DM 100,000 and married couples
whose income exceeds DM 200,000. The surcharge is expected to
yield DM 1.2 billion in 1973 and DM 2.4 billion on a full-year
basis. The proceeds from both the loan and the surcharge will

III -21
be frozen at the Bundesbank. The DM 5.2 billion to be thus
immobilized this year equals about 0.6 per cent of projected
German GNP in 1973.
The stability loan will be floated in several install-
ments, with the terms to be determined by market conditions at
the time the funds are raised. DM 1 billion is to be borrowed
this month. The stability loan is largely intended to help
offset the very substantial increase in the money supply produced
by the speculative rush into marks since February 1.
In purchasing $7,651 million since that date, the
Bundesbank has paid out about DM 23.5 billion. The money supply
has not increased by this amount; nor -- because of the 90 to
100 per cent requirements on non-resident bank deposits, a cut
in commercial bank rediscount quotas in February, an increase in
their reserve requirements on resident deposits in March, and
various measure adopted in early February to prevent investment
by non-residents in German assets -- can all of this sum be used
to stimulate economic activity in Germany. Nevertheless, enough
of it is available for spending and investment in Germany so that
already intense inflationary pressures have been magnified.
Prices continue to rise rapidly in Germany -- consumer
prices increased by 6.6 per cent from January 1972 to January 1973 --

III -22
at a time when the economy is again growing at a fast pace.
Seasonally adjusted real GNP increased at an annual rate of over
10 per cent from the third to the fourth quarter, and expansion this
year may continue at a rate of 5 to 6 per cent. The unemployment rate,
meanwhile, is already very low -- about 1 per cent -- and the
seasonally adjusted ratio of vacancies to unemployed in January
exceeded three.
Rapid rises in productivity in the next several months
should somewhat mitigate inflation by holding down rises in unit
labor costs. Wage settlements this year have generally been
providing for relatively moderate increases of 8.5 per cent a
year. However, because of more overtime and greater wage drift,
actual hourly wage costs have been rising much more swiftly.
Except for the stability loan and income tax surcharge,
the budget announced in February does not deviate significantly
from preliminary spending and revenue plans made public in
September. Government expenditures are expected to total about
DM 120 billion this year, an increase of almost 10 per cent over
actual 1972 outlays. This is slightly less than the probable
rate of increase in nominal GNP from 1972 to 1973.
Revenue (excluding the income tax surcharge) in 1973
should rise to about DM 116 billion, requiring the government
to borrow about DM 4 billion (in addition to the DM 4 billion to

III -23
be raised through the stability loans), approximately the same
amount it had to borrow last year. The principal tax change in
the budget was an increase in the tax on gasoline, effective July 1.
The Canadian budget for fiscal 1973-74 -- which begins
April 1 -- announced on February 19 is aimed primarily at stimula-
ting rapid economic growth in order to reduce unemployment.
Predictions of the increase in real GNP in 1973 compared to 1972
fall in a range of 6 to 7 per cent. Despite a relatively sizable
5.5 per cent increase in real GNP last year, the unemployment rate
has declined negligibly and remains unacceptably high. The jobless
rate in January was 6.2 per cent.
An increase of 8.8 per cent in government expenditures
on a national accounts basis is planned for the next fiscal year.
It is anticipated that government revenues, because of rapidly
rising income, will also increase substantially -- by about 11.5
per cent. A deficit of C$ 640 million is forecast compared to a
deficit of almost C$ 1.1 billion in 1972-73.
The 1973-74 budget includes several tax reductions.
Personal income taxes were cut effective January 1, officially
by 5 per cent but actually by only 2 per cent, since a temporary
3 per cent reduction was already in effect. The Federal sales
tax on food products and some articles of clothing is to be
abolished and some excise taxes are to be removed. Some additions

III -24
to 1971 tax reforms which will benefit small businesses and
family farms were introduced. As part of the new budget, Finance
Minister Turner has also urged enactment of last May's proposals
for tax reductions and liberalized depreciation rules for
manufacturing enterprises in Canada.
Other measures in the new budget which will also have
some stimulative effects include an increase in the basic rate of
old age security pensions and increased federal payments to poor
provinces.
The removal of the several sales and excise taxes
reflects the government's intent to use the budget to slow in-
flation as well as encourage growth. In another anti-inflationary
move, the government proposed temporary tariff reductions
averaging about 5 percentage points on about C$ 1.3 billion of
imported consumer goods.
Consumer prices in Canada increased by about 4.8 per
cent from 1971 to 1972. Wholesale prices of manufactured goods
rose much more rapidly, however -- by 7.3 per cent.
The budget also announced a long-term tax reform designed
to prevent decreases in real after-tax income resulting from the
interaction of inflation with a progressive income tax system.
Starting next year, the personal income tax system will be indexed

III -25
to price increases. The brackets to which given percentage
rates apply will be raised each year, as will principal exemptions,
according to an inflation factor based on the consumer price
index.
Although Parliament has given a vote of confidence to
the government's overall budget policy, each proposed measure
must now be acted upon individually. Of the individual items,
the coorporate tax cut and the depreciation allowance are in
difficulty because of opposition by the New Democratic Party,
on whose votes the Liberal government must rely.
